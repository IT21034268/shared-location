3,Easy and Cheap**update**,"This will be a quick review, I took these things out of the package (by the way the way, the pic of the square ones is accurate) set one next to the TV, plugged it in to power, set one next to cable box in cabinet, plugged it in to power, I did have to use the IR blaster because I could not set the unit in front of my box, make sure if you have to use the blaster the side with the wire coming out of it is facing your equipment, if you do that it works perfectly. Great product, pretty cheap, solved my problem.**UPDATE**So, like some other reviewers, I had to slightly move my transmitter and suddenly i could not make this thing work anymore, I fiddled with it for ten or fifteen minutes and now it works about 75% of the time, which is annoying....I suppose I would still buy it again, but it's not perfect, so expect that."
4,Would recommend to a friend.,I purchased this to see if it would work with my Directv HD/DVR and it does. I just wish it had more range than it does.
5,Even easier than it looks,Our new cabinets did not include glass doors and I was in a fix as to how I was going to get the remote controls to function. This is the neatest product. All I had to do was plug it in and everything worked. Amazon's price was also excellent. It was $18 less than the local electronics store.
1,This thing should not be sold,"I read the mixed reviews of this device, but felt that my use was over such a short distance and so far within the posted specifications that it would work for me. I was wrong. I tried a variety of placements of both the sender and the receiver and tried several reomtes. They hardly worked at all, when they did transmit the signal I had to hold the remote about an inch from the sending unit. One of the other reviews said that this device should not be sold. I agree,it should not be on the market."
2,Only works half the time,"I found the range very poor. Receiver and transmitter located only 15 feet away, seperated by a door. Door must be open for it to work, and even then, it only works half the time. Tried to change placement of transmitter/receiver, but that's the best I could do. Don't know why that happens, as I am not doing anything differently. So I just wait, and try it again in a few minutes to see if it works again."
2,BAD SINGER GOOD ACTRESS!,Jennifer lopez needs help on her singing but her music is great.Athough her voice is just horrible! but she can dance and act her acting is so great i watch all her movies the only movie i didn't see was THE CELL wich i really wanna see.But her single feeling so good was ok the music was great it was funky.like i said she can act and dance but not sing.
1,I remember this piece of poo,"I am walking down memory lane. I remember this cover, and I also remember I didn't like the album. In those days I liked just about anything so this must totally suck. Get Heavy Pettin 'lettin loose' or Riot 'fire down under' instead."
3,Video Quality,"The overall production is good, sound quality is very good but the video quality could have been better coming from Popular. I am keeping the dvd because the lack of this kind of music where I am now. Popular with all their revenues should do a better job regarding this matter."
3,Its ok,well about two years ago my frind let me borrow this and then he moved and he has yet to ask for it so I have been using it for a wial. it is kind of big and it only a two button stick but hey the one ive got has lasted a long time and it dosent seem to be giving out any time soon. so if you need a joystick this one is a good one.
5,Just like you were there.....,"I've watched these guys perform all over the country the last few years, and listening to this CD is just like being right there with them. The same energy and enthusiasm, and love for the music can be felt in every song. For anyone that enjoys live tambura music, this is the real deal. And the supporting cast they've put together is AWESOME. Definitely a keeper!"
4,Fun Pedal to Mess Around With,"This pedal is a great way to enjoy the sounds of a loud bass amp and a solid drummer, all while sitting on the sofa and not disturbing the other people around you. That was the reason I originally bought it - just to make at-home practicing a little more interesting.But I was very pleasantly surprised when I brought it to a jam session. This box is a great live tool as well. I was able to get many useful sounds, and I had a lot of fun with it. It's well worth the price."
3,worth it,"Unlike others who have reviewd this product, I did not expect an FM antenna to improve AM reception. It just doesn't work that way.As for Fm reception improvement, for a passive antenna system, this one performs well."
5,"Great to work with, speedy delivery!","The product was as described (runs a little large, if you are a girl) and the crotch is low (if this is a girl for a halloween costume). But they were AMAZING to work with. Ensured an even speedier delivering to get me the product in time for Halloween. 5 stars!"
4,"Native Forest Organic Papaya Chunks, 14-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)","This is the first time I have had Papaya in a can. I usually opt for a fresh one, but being that I am in the midwest US, we are in the winter season right now and the travel time for a fresh papaya to get to the store here really impacts the taste. Not a good thing.Since canned fruits are picked at the peek of their ripeness, I figured I would try these out and have to say I was not disappointed. I just wish they put more in the can. If you like Papaya though, I do no think you will be disappointed. Plus organic, thanks amazon."
4,80's Blow the House Down!!!,"Particularly not the best of their albums, but pay attention to the smooth, and love story type of songs that ""the Day After Tomorrow Night"", ""All the Difference in the World"" and ""Room in Your Heart""...great love songs...nice and decent album to collect from the 80's. (remember 3 good songs in an album is worth the $$$)"
3,Stretchable Slip cover,"Good material and good instructions for covering chair. It did say stretchable so I cannot complain that I had extra material left over that I easily tucked under the seat cushion. Therefore, it can be used for a very large recliner."
4,"Milwaukee 9083-20 1/2"" 14.4V Impact Wrench","This product is good for light duty work. It is in its sweet spot for driving lag bolts and other ""high torque"" fasteners. It has also proven capable of breaking loose stubborn bolts up to 1/2"". It is not a substitute for a high torque impact wrench. The tool is well made and is well balanced."
1,Useless!,A micro pinner that can't sink its nails is useless! Crank up the air and it still leaves the pins proud of the surface of what you are nailing.Senco should hand their heads in shame over this one. Buy the Porter Cable.
3,Gamble On Quest,"Vision Quest is a cult classic from 1985 that may well be best known for the number one song ""Crazy For You"" by Madonna that she also performed in the film. Madonna was a rising star when the film was released and the film garnered attention as it was her first appearance in a film. She sings the aforementioned ""Crazy For You"" and ""Gambler"" in a bar scene. Journey also scored a top ten hit with ""Only The Young"" which was originally recorded for their Frontiers album, but not released until the soundtrack. It has become one of their most enduring classics. Don Henley contributes one of the rarest songs in his catalog. It's a punchy track with backing vocals by Belinda Carlisle & Jane Wiedlin of the Go-Go's. The rest of the album is made of previously released tracks like ""Hot Blooded"" by Foreigner, ""Change"" by John Waite and ""Lunatic Fringe"" by Red Rider."
3,not as good as man of colours,"Thsi as a lead up to ""Man of Colours"" is a good album However Man of Colours"" album explore Mr. Davies vocals much more deeply and the songs have a more balanced feel maybe a little slower than this album."
5,More must have.,"I love DS because in a time were everything is fast and flash this show is like watching a greatstage play. Real people, Real entertainment. It is like reading a good book, not being dazed withspecial effects."
4,A Wonderful Bedtime Story,"(...)The prose is poetic, repetitive, hypnotic -- the perfect bedtime mix. At the same time, DeJong accurately conveys the inner thoughts and emotions of a small child who is completely taken with his first pet. I admit to sending the kids off to bed after reading them a chapter, then slinking back to read the next chapter on my own. PS The hymn Davie sings, ""He's the Lily of the Valley,"" can be heard on the web. Type the title into your browser."
3,"Good Author, Bad Publisher","Dean Radin's book is an excellent work. Unfortunately, this is the second book I've bought over the last year that is printed on very cheap pulp-paper. Only, HaperOne has done something that the other publisher didn't do, and that is print a hardcover book containing cheap pulp-paper.In the future, I will be looking to make sure that no book I buy is printed by HarperOne. I will not reward this nasty corporate trend with another dime."
2,somewhat redeemed by statements,"Plot seems unoriginal and story ends abruptly, and characters seemed to lack complexity, but I appreciated two aspects: (1) this novel recognizes a discontent and distrust of power in America and shows how it might be tapped; and (2) this novel presents the idea that if people believe in a person's message, that message can start to become reality even if the originator leaves the scene."
2,Big Disappointment,"When ""Dancing on the Couch"" came out in '86 the cassette included ""Don't Look Down (the sequel)"", a revamped version of a song from their first album. As a result, the CD isn't complete without it. Hence, the big disappointment. However, the sequel version of the song is included on ""Aces and Kings"". Score one for marketing; you need to buy all three albums to get everything you want. Go figure!"
2,"If I want to hear the radio, I'll buy one of these","This had a wee little shielding problem where a large local radio station played through my amp whenever this was in my pedal chain. Apparently this is a problem with some smaller, inexpensive pedals."
4,"great sound, poor construction","The unit arrived with a broken plastic battery compartment closure screw. I super glued it and it is holding so far. I do not like the fact that when power is applied to the unit, it defaults to it's non bypass state, so that I cannot just turn on my system and play, but must first hit the bypass button on the ""French Toast"". The sound, for the price, is terrific. I am thinking of putting it in a metal case with a true bypass 3PDT switch to fix it's problems. For the cost, I can live with it's deficiencies."
4,Michael J's video,I have always been a Jackson 5/Michael Jackson fan and I agree with the reviews that Moonwalker is awesome. I havn't seen the video in a few years and still remember it vividly. My son and I were downloading music (of MJ ) and it brought back memories of Smooth Criminal and all the claymation. This video cannot be beat for that time. We would give it a 5 rating if it were on DVD. Thats what we were looking for.
3,A Great Rockumentary,"Okay, no jokes, no pulling punches; we all know the kind of Hell Michael Jackson has been through in the past few years. But this film shows him in his greatest glory: as a naturally brilliant dancer, a truly gifted performer and showman, and as an inspired innovator in the art of the music video; all of these qualities coalescing to make Michael Jackson, The King of Pop."
2,Sorry to be disappointed...,"After watching ""This Is It"" 2 dozen times, I had set my hopes high that this was going to be another winner in my collection; I was wrong. Although I love Michael Jackson's work, this movie is just a disjointed collection of ideas that makes it impossible to follow, or enjoy fully. There are good moments in his performances, and interesting old footage, but I'm not planning to watch it a second time. In my humble opinion, save your money."
5,Outstanding Job,"This movie has excellent dancing and music in it, including the hit Smooth Criminal. While I think just having this dance/song alone is worth the movie, the rest of the movie is good as well. The plot teaches good morals and the fiction is pleasant. Fantastic!"
2,Mine came in Korean...?,"My DVD came in Korean...which frustrates me, since I don't see that mentioned anywhere in the product info and now I have to return it. If not for that, the product would be great because it arrived in good condition, but I'm not happy that it came in Korean and was not listed in the product info."
5,Moonwalker Review,"Oh My God!! I love this Movie, it is my all time favourite! Michael is the best at acting and the kids in it are cute too! But MJ rox the world! I loved the story line and Michael Jackson is just so hot! I would really recommend this movie to little kids, teenagers, adults, well anyone! This movie is a MUST SEE for any fan of Michael Jackson!!"
1,Cookbook Junkie,Caution! Do not buy the special package where you will receive three books by this author - the contents are identical despite the different titles.
2,"Did He exist? Why the sudden denial, and from what source?","Read the Bible yourself, not this collection of accusations.Consider for yourself the facts, how the Word has stood the test of time, despite all the attempts at attacking its credibility.The truth of the crucifixion and resurrection: 1 Corinthians 15:1-19Then and now there will always be scoffers: 2 Peter 3:3-9We were warned about people telling of ""another Jesus"" - can we say ""CULTS""? One prophecy of many: 2 Corinthians 11:3-4Changed lives. Fulfilled prophecies. No contradictions to science or archaeology. Meaning and purpose behind your life and life as a whole.You are cherished, loved by Him, made in His image. He is righteous but merciful. He wants you to come back home.He's waiting.==================""But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.""-1 Corinthians 2:14"
2,Conspiracy junkies unite!,"This book is perhaps one of the biggest con attempts played on anti-religionists. The entire premise of the book is founded the authors attempt to stretch controversy so thin that just a little common sense reveals the underlying errors.The authors have very little concept of statistical probability, and the use of data. Additionally, the inconsistencies presented in the book are numerous and continue through the whole. I find the concept of Biblical inerrancy to challenge common belief, however this book utilizes over-generalization and extreme language in order to blast the reader onto their heels. I was expecting to find some evidence here, but instead discovered petty theories of the small-minded.A must read for anyone who is desperate, yes desperate, in their attempt to find moral liberation at the expense of truth. Forget all the evidence, forget logic and reason, step right up and take a look at the folly of an emotive tirade."
1,Kindle version is unusable for research,"This is the first review I felt compelled to write for Amazon. For a book that claims to include ""copious notes giving sources, references, and greater detail for those who wish to analyze our arguments more thoroughly"", it's rather inexcusable that the Kindle edition's footnotes are not usable. They are included in the notes section, but none of it is linked to the footnote annotation within the text itself. To see a source or footnote, you first have to go to the table of contents (which is the only thing that is linked), travel to the notes section, then forward one page at a time until you reach the desired chapter and note number.This alone makes the book nearly worthless for research. If you buy it, don't get the Kindle edition."
3,Atheist Candy,"One of the peculiar characteristics of freethinkers is a sense of pride in their objectivity, an aspect of personality considered to be anything from reprehensible to blasphemous by theists. Therefore it seems sad that a book like this will probably speak only to those primed elsewhere for the theme, and to others it will say nothing.The opportunity is there, in my opinion, to rescue the remarkably hip idea contained in this book from such a fate. The entire book (and especially the final third) leans heavily on claims that much of the New Testament and most Christian commentaries on it are forgeries. However, not one proof or even example is offered. Photos showing variations in handwriting would have been nice, for instance. Instead, there are only repeated references to conclusions made by ""scholars"" as if that should suffice in place of evidence.Ironic, no?"
5,the book that you need to read if you think you are a Christian,"This was the book that inspired Uffington to write theThe Greatest Lie Ever Told. He uses it as a springboard to investigate where Freke and Gandy leave off. The Jesus Mysteries gives you all the early details of the spiritual concepts behind the church. It gave me a better understanding of Plato and the Gnostic Paul. In fact until I read the Jesus Mysteries, I didn't know Paul was a Gnostic and a heretic, but now I can understand what he writes in his Epistles.The book is an excellent academic work that gives you facts not speculation. The parallels between the pagan world of the mysteries and Christianity are made very clear. If you are an orthodox Christian who wants to be secure in the lies you have grown up with, you won't like what you find in this book. It you are a spiritual Christian who searches for the truth, this book is a good place to take the next step on your journey."
2,Kind of a mess,"I like Everett Lewis' movies. His characters are always quirky, kind of at the edge of society and the actors he chooses to play their parts, are well chosen and provide great dialogue. I've watched this thing two times, and my response is that it's kind of a mess. No clear story lines about the three male prostitutes, doesn't really add up to much,and like a foreign art movie that is supposed to have some deep meaning, to the ordinary observer, it looks like a piece of crap.It is difficult to have any sympathy for any of the characters here. No one makes any real connections with each other, and the film ambles along much like three semi-connected nightmare dreams sequences involving people who are on the road to nowhere. A much better choice in terms of the subject matter here would be Andy Warhol's Heat. Skin and Bone could have been a much better film. Would like to see Everett Lewis redo it today and see what he could come with. His later films are much better."
4,Unltravox best of,"Had longed for this album ever since losing my cassette version way back when it was originally released.Ultravox certainly emulate the sound of the 80's - big synthesiser choruses and drum machines. Midge Ure's melodies are strong and catchy. ""Vienna"" is a classic stand-out."
3,Buy it.,"Ultravox had a couple of big hits, ""Dancing..."" and ""Vienna"". They had others, but these were the big ones. Like some other 80s artists, they didn't have enough good hits to fill an album, so this one has got some mediocre tracks on it. However, if you're like me, and want those few big hits, then you'll buy the album."
5,"Easy, Fun, quality, great price =one heck of a camera!","I admit, even being the young techno geek I am, i've never had much interest in digital cameras, especially due to the prices. But then I got the 780c from my Uncle this Christmas and I'm having an absolute ball with it. Whint like an hour, I was taking pictures, downloading them on the computer with the family christmas photos and watching them oh the TV. The online manual is really easy to use and the photo software is as plain as english can get. The camera itself has a great quality and feel to it. Go grab a 8meg card (about 20 bucks) for it and take pictures to yours hearts content, even on high resolution, you can get 45 pics! I'll never got back to regular cameras, this is to much fun. If youve wanted to jump into the digital camera world but didn't want to make a big splash in the money bank, this is a fun and cheap way to get into it! Get one today and you won't be disappointed!"
5,many aspects to explore,"This book has been a big hit with my 5 y.o. son. He loves Waldo type search books and this book has similar searches, but also incorporates different cultures, new vocabulary, and tidbits of information. This book has been a great starting point for many discussions about other cultures and other countries. I'm looking forward to bringing the History Search book out of our attic soon too."
4,"Great product, saves lots of time and sticky fingers","Love these filters - unwrap, install, ride. Only complaint is the price...can it be so expensive to spray oil on the filter and bag at the factory?"
5,"Super deal, great product","Love them , love them , love them! Got mine right away but did notice Amazon has had some problems latley shipping but it wans't the products fault! Anyway nice set for the money."
3,Spend the dollars to get a better clamp.,"These clamps are cheaply made, with very sticky acme screws. I was not real impressed."
1,Where are they?,This might be good clamps but after waiting over 2 months I gave up on them. If they backorder these on you don't wait just go buy something else.
3,Perfect for P&S sized cameras,"I bought this bag for my Olympus E-510 and got dissapointed. First of all the camera (with de 28-50mm lens mounted), a 50-150mm lens, two lens hood, lens caps, battery charger and its cable, video cable and USB cable are too much for this bag... in other words, all these stuff fits into the bag but there is no space for an ant!!!! what if I carry a cloth for cleaning the lens? or a lens filter?... it's too small... maybe they expect that you may carry your battery charger and cables in another bag!!! I bought this because they say that a SLR camera (with a lens mounted), another lens and a flash can fit into this bag..."
4,Great medium between backpack and case!!,"I purchased this bag for my Canon EOS 40D. Im sure a lot of people would not have made that decision. The body of the 40D is fairly wide. Upon, first fitting the 40D, the sides were a bit tight, which is what I wanted for the most part. After fitting the 40D with a 28-105mm 3.5-4.5, I still had space for an additional lens (about the same size) and the battery charger. In the front zipper pocket, I was able to fit memory card, and some filters. The strap makes it extremely convenient for easy access. If you want to bring the essentials, I say go for this bag. You might want to look at the other models for telephoto lenses or additional lenses."
1,Dissapointing price and unbelievable thin pillow for the money,"I'm sorry but this pillow is like a standard one, and the filling is like someone took half as it should.I bought last year for the same price in a department store, a down pillow, and was twice the filling and it was a standard. If you could wait and see some down in the prices in Macy's for example, go and buy a charter club, as I did last year , at least it would worth the price and you could see the pillow as actually is.If I could I would return the 2 pillows right away!"
3,Soft Down Pillow,The down pillow is low and perfect for some side and stomach sleepers. The 16oz. fill seems to be standard for average down pillows. This pillow is just above average. The cotton Royal Velvet monogrammed cover is too stiff. I will try to wash it to soften or just use other pillow covers.If you need a new down pillow buy this one when it is on sale.
2,Seemed like a good deal...,"You get what you pay for. Bought this 3 years ago. The heat plates have disintegrated and cost about $100 to replace.....almost 1/3 the cost of a new grill. Ducane may be part of the Weber family but this grill is NOT even close to a Weber. If you want a grill that will last, make sure all the parts are STAINLESS."
4,not as good as pull my chain,this cd is good but pull my chain is still my favorite.toby has got some really great songs on this one.
1,Famous for all the wrong reasons.,"Look guys. I hate to burst your bubble. This is a bad album. I am a fan of country - this still sucks. A lot.Admittedly, I think Toby Keith is an idiot capitalizing on 9/11. Nevertheless, you find that the majority of the album is ultimately forgettable. He's not talented, and is simply using ""patriotism"" to sell a record. The positive reviews here prove this: they are all seemingly based on the concept of ""we love this album because loving it makes liberal people mad.""Listen to an album for musical value. Not because you have stupid political agendas."
5,Same great talent,"While this CD isn't the 10 that Unleashed was, it still is far superior to the vanilla offerings in the country genre. Toby rules as the best voice, best song writer, freshest ideas and megatalent leader in country today."
2,Yeee Haw! Calling all ignorant hicks....,This is the perfect disc for you! Just better save up those brains cells before you start...cause you won't have many left at the end of this right-wing hick album!
4,Interesting Vocals,"I am new to Country music (somewhat) and fell in love with this album for all the best reasons. The controversial hit here that propelled Toby Keith to the top is nothing more than an updated, more mature version of Don McLean's ""American Pie"". It could have been recorded by Bruce Springteen.""Who's Your Daddy"" and ""It's All Good"" are nice, bouncy, feel-good songs that are perfectly crafted American country songs. In fact, all the songs on this CD are near classics. ""Rodeo Moon"" is the perfect cowboy lamentation song and ""Losing My Touch"" is a great lonely romantic ballad. ""Huckleberry"" is so sweet, you wonder if it's the same guy who wrote ""Courtesy Of The Red, White And Blue"""". Only ""Beer For My Horses"" is slightly tepid, but hey, it's Willie Nelson and you never turn him down."
4,Buy!,"Set arrived in great condition. The chips have a good feel to them, much better than plastic chips. It's kind of a must buy at this price. Only thing I'm a little miffed about is that there are no 25s in the set. The step from 10 to 100 seems a little odd, but fortunately there are plenty of 10s - you'll need them."
1,"Bland, generic 80s metal","Armored Saint was one of those bands that no ever really cared about, even in the 80s. They were simply a band that copied much better ones, not really having any originality. There is this guy out there named ""Scott"" who loves this band for some strang reason, actaully thinking they were good 80s metal,*shakes head and laughs*.Just imagine a horrible singer like John Bush surrounded by uninspired generic musicians(AS) instead of creative and talented ones (Anthrax), and that is just a basic picture of what this cr!p band is all about.These guys were like the Creed of 80s metal, bland riffs, unmemorable songs and horrible vocals."
3,Solid effort for one of the 'old guard',"""March of the Saint"" is often considered classic by many metal mavens, a launching pad for one of the more critically acclaimed classic metal acts around. And it's true that the album is chock full of chunky, hummable riffs, and if you're not carefull, your knees will begin tapping and your head will begin banging, so infectious are many of these tunes.However, with all that said, after what I've been listening to lately, Armored Saint just can't compare musically. I'm not saying the music on this highly regarded album is bad; far from it. It's great, simple, hooky anthem metal. If that's your cup of tea, well add at least 1 star to the 3 I gave it. It just isn't complex or captivating enough for me to go higher than that. Manowar is the only band I allow to do that :-). This is probably worth the purchase though if you are a fan of the aforementioned anthem metal."
1,over priced,"Collar is fine. The price wasn't. I was looking at two-packs and comparing pricing. There were a couple of offers about the same price and I selected one. Turned out somehow this vendor's offer for a single collar got in the mix. I didn't catch it. The price was the same others in the marketplace offered for a two-pack, which I later purchased because I have a couple of dogs. Don't know how it snuck in with the other offerers. I contacted the seller and they said they'd take the collar back for a three dollar restocking fee. Not. I'll admit, my mistake for being so stupid. Moral, buyer beware of price gougers."
5,Insightful,"When I read negative reviews of this book, I inevitably wondered if the critics actually read this scholarly work. Or do they really believe that things like re-writing history or trouncing on the First Amendment can be justified?The author's experiences and analysis ring true with the irrational, postmodern, and pseudoscientific nonsense I have encounter in nursing academia from aggressive ""gender feminists."" Thirty years ago, 15% of nurses were male; today it's half that many. It may have something to do with academia's hostility towards men. One nurse academic even published a paper explaining why male nurses should never do nursing research because they could never understand this female profession. Argh.The author makes a convincing argument that gender feminism is academically lazy, undisciplined, overbearing, and has no respect for science/reason. I hope in the years since this book was written that this destructive trend has waned."
1,"Wow, what a piece of junk.","This book basically tries to confine women into the same gender roles that ""gender feminists"" have been trying to fight for years. It basically seems that she wants to fight women who are fighting for female power, rather than dealing with the serious threats to women."
1,Stella Rama,"After reading the book, the only woman I can think of that has betrayed women is Christina Hoff-Sommers. A disappointment indeed!"
3,Not exactly what you might think,I would agreewith the other comments here. With the exception that my price was only $60! Handles don't turn well. Okay for light work I suppose but I will have to get more substantial clamps and I had hoped I wouldn't. You get what you pay for.
5,AN EXTRAORDINARY BOOK ABOUT DAILY LIFE IN THREE CITIES,"This book is a comparative study of daily life in three historic cities. Students of sociology, anthropology, and comparative social history will benefit from reading these first-person accounts of individual aspirations, disappointments, and triumphs.The cultural differences between the French, the residents of the former Soviet Union, and the Californians are interesting, but what these great people share in common and their attitudes facing daily life are valuable reminders of why we have survived as a species."
5,Excellent Camera,"I've had one of these for a while, and this is truly an excellent camera. Clean, clear picture quality. Easy to review/delete pictures currently in the camera with the LCD screen. Super-fast transfer of the images if you add a PCMCIA SCSI card reader to your PC or Mac. Add a huge flash card for high capacity (98 highest-quality pix on a 48MB card).Only things I don't like about it is that the 'manual focus' isn't truly manual--you can choose from a number of set distances, and same with the exposure."
4,"Can't beat the price, image quality and connectivity","After 15 years freelancing with a 35mm system, this is the first digital to balance price, image quality and ease of use in moving files. First started using it parallel with film to support an industrial client's web pages. Now client appreciates my ability to remotely file same-day images of emergency operations.It's obvious I wish this camera had more lens options, but it's doing the job at a fraction of the cost of comparable professional digitals."
3,Great Pictures BUT Poor Battery Life...,"I've had this camera for 8 months and I'm on my THIRD one from Kodak. Each has the same problem, it eats batteries like crazy. You CANNOT use conventional alkaline batteries - not even KODAK brand PhotoLife batteries - they last less than a dozen or so shots! And it freezes up on occassion and the only way to reset it is to open the battery compartment and release the batteries then reset it by closing the battery compartment. Three cameras and all have the same problem - not good! Not exactly the best design either - clumsy to hold and awkward to use - not much thought went into the design of this particular model while other Kodak models seem better designed... not smart for the ""top of the line!""No wonder Kodak discontinued this model. Now if they will only take it back and give me one that works! (in defense of this model - it does take great shots and while the download via USB is sluggish at best, the outcome is the best I've seen in any digital."
5,One of the best books on the personality of the alcoholic.,"If you, or someone you know, has a drinking problem or is an alcoholic, this book will surely expand your awareness of why this person is the way s/he is. If you truly care about this sick person who is destroying him/herself, this book is a must read."
4,Study The Size Chart and end up with a super shoe,"Ok, I really love this shoe. I am normally a size 7 and purchased a 9 wide. I think it is a hair big and next time will go for an 8 1/2 wide (if they have it) I love the feel of the shoe. The toe and back heal are hard, but it does not bother me. I highly suggest you read as many reviews as you can and study the size chart before you decide which size is best for you. Adorable shoe... I wonder if I can return and add to my review after I use it at dance?"
3,I THINK I SPEAK FOR MANY OTHER DAN HARTMAN FANS...,"... when I say that what we'd really like to see is a reissue of all of Dan's solo albums for Epic Records (with ""12 versions/radio edits tacked on as bonus tracks), ESPECIALLY the long-awaited ""Relight My Fire"". So how about it, SONY?"
4,Black men,"This book will challenge you to look at men who have been instumental politically and educationally in America. You may not close the book liking them all and probably won't agree with everything they said or did, but you will go away with more knowledge and understanding of their positions."
2,Disturbingly Hard To Control,I haven't gotten past the first level because the controls are so bizzare in this game. Buy something else and don't be this cheap.
4,AMAZING!!!!!,This game definitly uses the power of the Nintendo Wii. This game does not start off easy though. It takes around 2 to 3 hours to acually really get good at it. But ohhhhhh its worth it. The sword fight never get old and when you get trigger happy... its awesome. GET IT IF U HAVE A WII!!!!
2,Too much Hype,"I picked up this, dbz, and zelda on the launch. I tried this one first and could not get into it at first, the controls are hard to get used too. After playing zelda some i went back to this game and got used to the controls. Beat the game and haft to say im dissapointed with this game. I really wanted it because of the hype, but even using the sword was a let down to me. I thought that atleast the sword fighting would be a nice innovative touch, but it let me down. With all the hype that this game got it turned into another halo 2 (story mode, not multi)"
2,Does anybody know how to write good conversation anymore?,"Why do game developers spend endless wads of dough on graphics and almost none on decent writing? These games don't have to have the utter blandness of a Jean Claude Van Damme throwaway film. Halo, Half Life, Max Payne, Ratchet and Clank all prove that.But the writing for this title is dreck. Combine that with endless encounters with dumb people holding guns, and even more dumb people holding katanas (that I don't just blow away with a shotgun?!?) and you have wasted fifty bucks.The Wiimote is the one saving grace of this game. It's a vastly superior control for first person shooters than the traditional Xbox/PS3 controller. It's the closest thing to mouse-and-keyboard gaming possible.Buy a Wii first person shooter. Just not this one."
4,hard at first then great fun. Feels like you're in an action movie!,"Within the first 15 min.s of playing this game I thought to myself...what did I buy? This is horrible and frustrating! Two things, first I wasn't used to the Wii controller yet, second, I certainly wasn't used to how Red Steel plays. I post this as a warning to those who easily give up. Some reviewers of this game have sighted the controls as being ""broken"". They certainly are not! By hour 3 of gameplay you'll be killing bad guys and sword fighting like a Samurai. As moves and features are added further into the game, it becomes even more fun. The level designs and style of some of the later missions are wonderfully perfect to match the mood. I felt like I was in a Hong Kong action movie. Give it a chance, especially if you're new to the Wii, you can't play this game sitting down!"
4,Asics GT-2100,"This is the fifth pair of this model shoe I've purchased. I've also bought/tried other models but keep coming back to this one. It's a fine shoe for running, and for the price, you can't beat it. I usually put in between 10-15 miles a week, and they hold up well for months. By the way they make great walking around shoes as well. Will keep buying them as long they keep making them."
1,These fell apart 2 months after I purchased them,"I have been a distance runner for 8 years, and I have always sworn by Asics running shoes. When I purchased these shoes, they were great for the first two months. Then, last night, I noticed the black treads on the bottom had started to peel off already. Now I have to buy a new pair of shoes as a result. I will never buy Asics again, and I don't suggest that you do either unless you enjoy spraining your ankles."
2,Good Movie - Bad Frame Rate,"The movie was pretty good.However, the dvd had major frame rate quality issues.The video was quite choppy, as if it were shot at 20 frames per second.We tried the dvd in two different dvd players, but the result was the same.We paid top dollar for this dvd when it first came out, and were very disappointed with the quality of the product."
1,Bad zipper,"This is a cute and sturdy case, however the zipper broke shortly after purchase! Useless!"
5,Skagen Women's Watch,"Skagen Women's Stainless Steel WatchReceived this watch as a Christmas present,its exactly what I wanted! The color is beautiful"
4,Lovely Watch,"This is a very attractive watch. The clasp however, takes some time to get used to. My only complaint is that I have extremely small wrists, and with the band being adjusted so much, it is a little bulky around the back side. The crystals on the face are much smaller than I visualized from the picture. Overall, including the price I am very happy with my purchase."
5,Class,"The perfect watch for wearing every day on any occasion. I love gazing at it. The mother of pearl face, the elegant deco hands, the crystal hour markers, the beveled square face, the tapered thin band: all of these elements work together to create the best possible classic watch. Easy to wear and addictive."
5,wow,"This CD is a very very hardcore CD not intended for people under the age of 40. I first heard this band in a BMX movie wreck section. In it the movie intertwines wrecks with a homemade film of one of their so called ""concerts"". I prefer to call them riots full of flaming bats, broken bottles, and anything else that might be considered a weapon. The music is rough and edgy which adds to the gory lyrics. If i wasn't poor i would buy this CD so fast because i'd be worried about getting killed by the band. Thank you BAD LUCK 13 RIOT EXTRAVAGANZA!"
4,Great Robin Hood Tale,An excellent take on the Robin Hood Legend told mainly from Marian's point of view. Great characters throughout and hard to put down!
1,You'll fall asleep,"I'm sorry but this movie bored the crap out of me. I found the front cover misleading. I thought this would have been a thriller about high society life not everything is what it seems. I fell asleep half way. Borrow it, don't even rent, worse yet don't buy it!"
2,For Dylan fanatics only,"I went into viewing this film with pretty low expectations, but still was hugely disappointed. There is no live music here, just previously recorded album cuts playing in the background as Jones comments, ad nauseum, on Dylan's hat and more. This is really just a vanity piece for Mickey Jones. Jones was a great 60's drummer, but these home movies should have stayed at home.There are a few worthwhile shots of Dylan and the Band at work and play, but precious few. At many points I felt challanged to continue watching. Jones doesn't have a lot to say, but he keeps talking anyway. There certainly is not any new insight into the dynamics that drove this revolutionary tour. Jones seems in awe of Dylan himself, but that keeps us at arm's length.For those of you new to Dylan, the infinitely superior ""Don't Look Back"" is the place to start, not here."
2,Not good but not awful,"This is definitely one for hard core fans. If you read the box it's pretty clear what it is - and it doesn't take much to guess what 37 year old 8mm footage looks like! Mickey's amusing and interesting at times and there's the odd section that gives you a bit of a feel for what the tour was like - but it's not great. It is however what there is, apart from ""eat the document"". So if you're hard core buy it with your head on (...)and if you're not then steer clear."
3,NOT THIS TIME,"EVERYONE THINKING OF BUYING THIS, DONT! GET RETURN TO 36 CHAMBERS, ACTUALLY NO IF U AINT GOT THAT U AINT AN ODB OR WU FAN R.I.P OL DIRTY"
1,ODB's worst album ever,"How can anybody really seriously consider this album to be his best album ever? Half the songs are just old vocal tracks featuring new lame beats (Dirty N' Stinkin feature the EXACT same vocal tracks from his version of ""Susudio"" from the Phil Collins tribute album). One song also takes the vocal tracks from C'Mon from Return of the 36 Chambers, and another takes the vocal tracks from ""Dog****"", off the Wu-Tang Forever album. Best tracks are by far the Intro track and the hilarious ""Takin a ****"", ... Brought a tape recorder into the stall and went to town. Masterpiece. They should have just released that as a single and left it at that. In the words of the Simpsons comic book store owner.....""Worst album ever!"""
1,Horrible Movie,One word to describe this movie is Horrible. One of the all time worst Comedies ever made. Very bad acting not one good actor is this movie. This Director must have out of his mind to even work on a horrible film like this. Dont waste your time or money on this DVD please people dont. It is not even worth the .99 cents I paid to rent the DVD. In fact im going to tell them the DVD was messed up to get my money back. I don't believe in giving anything at all a bad review but I must here. My advice to the director of this film please find another profession to get into. How could you make a rotten movie like this. In the future please shoot your movies on video tape or film. It looks real bad when you use both film and video.
3,FMW Review,"The matches on this tape were pretty damn good, especially the last three matches were the barbwire scenerios. The only thing that was not good about the tape was Toykyopop's commentary and their breaks between matchs were they goof around in the training ring."
5,Enchantingly charming!,Join Mildred for her second year at Cackle's Academy full of enchanting mischief and fun. Set 4 is the second/last part of the 2nd season and includes these episodes:Carried AwayThe Dragon's HoardThe Genius of the LampUp in the AirFair is Foul and Fouls are FairGreen Fingers and ThumbsThe Millennium BugThere is also a few special features: Photo Gallery and Georgina Sherrington (Mildred) Interview - the same as was on Collection Set 2 (Miss Cackle's Birthday Surprise) - Cast Trivia and a brief overview on Making Potions and Casting SpellsI find The Worst Witch series delightfully charming and hope that they will soon get Seasons 3 and 4 on DVD as well!
1,not a camera,this is not a camera and on the package it clearly says viewer. but i thought it was a camera
4,Pretty good... I wish GRAW employed the things that make this game great,"This is a pretty good game for shooter fans. The guns are for the most part accurate, the cover system is excellent - why can't games like Call of Duty 4 have cover systems like this game has? Heck, why can't Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter have cover systems that are as easy to use as this? The graphics are ok, although fall off bigtime when compared to games like Call of Duty... although your character looks fantastic when behind cover. Teamates AI isn't great, but better than some games. Most of the time they do the right thing. Ending is terrible. But I don't buy shooters really for the story, I buy it because I want to shoot terrorists."
4,Really awesome game,"this game really accelerates the feel of the legacy that is Tom Clancy's rainbow six. it really was one of the best games that i have played although it was painfully short on the normal game difficulty. the second should really answer some questions, so i would get both of them to really get the full game story which lacks a little in RSV as the story is bitted together whith the picture-in-picture briefings that don't really make any sense, though the point of any given mission is to kill the terroist. This is made more exciting with the variety of ways to enter a room and clear it etc. the commands are really just fantastic with the variety of ways to get to a certain place or room, which really just makes the overall game 4 stars since the story and motivation don't really shine though the graphics are simply amazing."
4,Viva las Vegas!,"The newest in the Rainbow six franchises is the best one yet. A good FPS with awesome graphics and game play. The real world tactics are very accurately depicted. This game is true to its military route, fire team hand signals, MOUT room clearing, fast roping and repelling and tactical formations. You get an array of real world weapons. The setting this time is Las Vegas. This adds to the coolness factor. Sometimes it's hard to get an accurate bead on your enemy but it's a minor problem that is easy to shrug off as you're playing. One of the best shooters and if you're an online games this one is defiantly up your alley. This is one to buy for sure."
2,"Nice, but not holding up","I cleaned the tub, dried it well, then rubbed with alcohol. The strips stuck pretty well at first, but one by one they are coming off in a matter of weeks."
5,"Hands down,it's EPSON","Through the years of owning printers,I've had the pleasure of using Top Brand name printers,HP,LEXMARK,EPSON. Because I run alot of graphic software,and print from my camcorder to make stills of my Family.Nothing is close to the photo print quality you get from Epson and their ink.When I take a scan and copy the picture with 1200 dpi,on photo paper(also Epson)you cannot tell them apart. I have given away my HP and Lexmark printers and Hands down I'm sticking with EPSON. Thanks for a perfect product."
3,"Prints great pictures, but...","These cartriges print out great pictures, but if you remove them from the printer, they will not work. In order to get my cartriges to work after removing them for under 10 seconds, I had to clean the cartriges literally 20 or more times untill they would work. This took me over an hour, and used up more than 1/3 of my ink! This is very strage, I can remove, switch and refil the cartriges on my parent's PC's priner, and it works fine. I don't know how you can refil a cartrige that you can't even remove for 10 secs and you can't acces it without removing it. People say that you can, but I don't know how. Anyway, these cartriges are also very expensive, I'm still trying to find a cheaper cartrige, or even better, one that can be refilled somehow."
5,Warriors... come out and play-ay,great movie with a truly crazy antagonist. The gangs they encounter are both colorful and dark and will make you laugh for a moment then absolutely disturb you
2,"New version is screwed up, indeed...","Look, to sum up this debacle: the extra features have an EXTENDED discussion of how hard it was to get the last shot with the sun coming up on the beach and the Warriors walking off into the distance...and that shot is SCREWED by the new comic book nonsense, which ends with a quick freeze-frame devolving into a stupid comic book frame...they go on and on about it, and it ain't even in this version of the film!?!?!!Oh, and Remar's priceless reaction to the Baseball Furies is screwed up by Hill's comic book ""improvements"", too...But then I think all the deleted scenes that were reinserted into the television cut back in the day, to make it longer, are lame and pointless too, which some here don't agree with...Suffice to say, the theatrical release was King and always shall be. Luckily, I have it. I'm sellin' this, although it was nice to see the documentaries (once)..."
5,EXCELLENT!!!!!,"I'm from Argentina, I buy the item... and in seven days I receive it in Buenos Aires... EXCELLENT ALL!!! THANKS!!!!!!! TEN OVER TEN!"
2,Mediocre campy movie,"This is a pretty cheesy flick. Our heros , accused of a murder they didn't commit, face barriers on their treck back to Coney island, by rival gangs. Lots of chasing through the subway, and unmemorable rumbles with other gangs. The movie, however, has some historic relevence in the perceptions of gangs at a time when the Guardian Angels were up and comming. Has that New York flair, but for the most part the movie is not that entertaining. Have lots of munchies on hand to get yourself through this film if you truely want to view it all ."
3,Overated but enjoyable.,"A comic book action that tries to hard to be dramatic when it's just a fun movie at heart.Walter Hill's ""The Warriors"" caused many gang riots when it first came out."
4,simple plot but easy to watch with a great sound track,"Having stumbled on this movie 20 years ago, my friends and I still feel this is one of the great cult classics of all times. The sound track is super and blends beautifully with the motif. It is very easy to get behind the ""heros"" of this movie. This is not a motion picture master piece and not a reflection of actual gang life. As long as the viewer understands these two facts, then the movie becomes a very enjoyable action/adventure movie. Michael Beck is great! The cartoon series ""Anamaniacs"" even parodied probly the most famous line of the movie, ""Warriors...come out to play"". I would recommend this movie to anyone especially if you loved the music of the 70's."
3,The Warriors,"Okay, now everyone in my family (apart from me) LOVES this movie. Beats me why but they do. The story is that rival gangs are called to one spot for a meeting with the promise everyone will be fine. The man who calls the meeting gets shot and the killer blames The Warriors who must carefully hurry home, crossing all sorts of gang lines to do so, before getting killed. I am not a gang story kind of gal so that said my family gives it a unified five and mine is a three so gauge with that for yourself."
1,Buy the original!!!!!!!!!,"This version is a sad joke.The original movie gets 4 or 5 stars, this ""ultimate directors cut"" should get zero.Here's the original:The Warriors"
3,entertaining romp,"No fantastic acting here, but it is a fun ride with a lot of action and fistfights occurring as a gang tries to get home to Coney Island with every other NY gang after them for the wrong reasons."
4,"THE WARRIORS,director's cut","great classic movie.very good story line,authentic in every way.very good depiction of the era when gangs were at their rising point."
4,Excelent movie!,"I really love The Warriors! I saw this movie for the first time when I was 13 years old. This version is great. For the first time I see interview with the original actors (in the actual time of course!) This version mix comic book with movie in some escens,(that did not really like me but anyway...)Good quality, good movie, Can you dig it? ;)"
3,A real New York film,"To me what makes this a classic are the gritty aesthetics and crime of New York City in the 70s that are presented here. Few movies do this so well; filmed all on location with only NYC actors gives it its authenticity. I won't argue with hardcore fans of this film who were affected by it when they first saw it long ago, it's a fun film. But honestly the script is banal and at times cheesy (which I'm aware is a point of debate with fans and reviewers). I suppose it will always stand up as one of the better gang films but i didn't find it terribly exciting. Most importantly there is something to be said for face-to-face fist fights, instead of today's gun-toting gangs, onscreen and in real life: it's much more ballsy than a gun."
2,"4 Star Classic Film. But, Bad Director's Cut","Why in the Hell did Walter Hill decided to add those stupid comic book like scenes and cut some very cool scenes? According to him, he wanted to make sure that people knew like this was some kind of fantasy-type film, like we didn't know that.The Warriors is a masterpiece, and this is a director's vut alright, he cut the good stuff and added crappy comic book sh_t. At least they should've added 2 edtions of the film on this DVD, the theatrical release and the butchered director's cut.I do like the way they remastered the footage, looks very updated. The special features are good, too. However, many fans of this film including myself are gonna be mad about how Walter Hill destroyed his own film on DVD.No wonder he hasn't had a hit in years, he must be brain dead."
5,Warriors,"Warriors is the original Judgment Night. It is part gangster, part thriller type of movie. Intense, violent, ""edge of your seat"" is an understatement. Human survival in the concrete jungle and nobody depicts it better. One of my favorite movies, along with Judgment Night starring Emilio Estevez and Cuba Gooding Jr., ever made regardless of genre/category."
1,Citri-dip,"I bought this because I read so much good stuff about this for removing the terrible orange color of SX bass guitar necks. Well, either the SX-factory changed their lacquer or Citristrip changed their product because nothing happend to the finish of the bass neck. Completely nothing! Even after 23 hours, of which two and a half with the neck wrapped in foil. In the end I had to remove the lacquer with a scraper and had to sand it all. I can't be certain that it's the Citristrip that's not working, but for me it was not the succes I hoped for.Tools & Home Improvement did their best though! The product was sent very quickly to the Netherlands (Europe) and very well packed. Cudo's!"
4,Great product,"Citristrip works slower than some of the ""deathly"" chemicals I've tried, and I have to scrape off and reapply it once or twice to get through three layers of paint. However, I like the fact that I can leave this product on furniture for several hours before scraping; also, it smells nice and caused me no respiratory or skin irritation. The residue can be cleaned easily by scrubbing with mineral spirits (which CAN cause irritation)."
1,Not a good paint remover and very expensive,"I bought this stripper to remove varnish from my kitchen cabinets. I left it over night and in the morning the scraped and scrubbed the residue, but the varnish would not come off. I wasted $20 for a 1/2 gallon...I would not recommend it."
4,Impossible to curl after using this.,"I flat or curl my hair depending on my mood. The first time I tried this product, I just wanted to see how it felt, the thickness, and the smell. It was ok. Not as thick as others, but good enouhg for an everyday use. I got out of the shower and completely forgot about it. But then I tried to curl my hair. At first I thought my iron was not hot enough, then I thought that maybe I wasn't doing it right, and the morning after, I finally understood that the product would not let me curl anything. Good to keep frizzing away, and very helpful to keep it straight."
4,Good snack size,"This is the third flavor I have tried in the mini cookies. It is not as good as the oatmeal raisin. I really like this size instead of thelarger size, just right for a snack or have 2 for breakfast. The mini size has only 100 calories where the large size is over 300."
1,I guess I just don't get it...,"This writing was all flat, and Lane likes to shock the reader with his overt descriptions of gay sexuality. I guess I missed something pretty fundamental - because I didn't find it unputdownable ..."
2,Come on Boyz,"I'm a huge Boyz II Men fan. I have all of their albums and think they are arguably the best singing group out there (talent wise), but you can tell Babyface's influence. Their last album was subpar. I can't even remember a song off of it. This album is just as bad with the exception of ""Color of Love"" (Babyface again) and maybe ""Oh Well"". None of the other songs flowed well. I can't tell the chorus from the verses in some. Guys, stick to the ballads that's what you do best. I still think they are great guys and I'll continue to buy their music."
2,Water Exercises,I thought this would be a great CD for our senior class. It started out with instructions but ended up with more music and no instructions. Sold the CD to an instructor in another state.
1,Not what I expected,"I purchased this product to help me with severe Plantar Fasciatis in my left foot. 3 months later the pain persists. I have had absolutely no relief from these inserts. In fact after about a month and a half of wearing them, I removed them from my shoes because the pain was worse. They were not the miracle cure that they promised to be. I was very disappointed with them and am still searching for help in relieving this pain."
4,Kodak DC240 Digital Camera,"I was recently very lucky to receive this digital camera as a gift for my birthday. Having had an ordinary 35 mm camera previously this camera is like a dream come true. Excellent pictures, easy to review after taking them and extremely easy to operate. All the instructions are straightforward and the controls are very simple to use even for someone like me who is a basic amateur photographer. Within a few weeks of having the camera I have taken some wonderful photos. I have found uploading them extremely easy especially in conjunction with Photosuite III."
3,Ditch Kresge,"I feel that putting Geoff Kresge in charge of song writing can only be described as a gargantuan mistake. The songs are only ehhhhh... With one major exception. Walk like a Zombie is a song that is a worthy song. I found out the reason why that song is an exception. It was written when the first cd was put out and just did not get released on Hell Yeah. I still love the band and think that the skies the limit for them, but they really need to take the pen away from Kresge, maybe even the guitar. Hell, even get rid of Kamilla, since she's the one that brought her husband into the band. I feel that he brings a negative energy into the Horrorpops. Kim and Patricia are the Horrorpops."
3,Could be more hands on...,"The text of the book is good, but I was expecting better activities. They are very traditional school activities and many say to research issues/topics on the internet. Not hands on at all."
4,"""Gatchaman and Extras ~ Curtin & Sakuma","Silva America presents ""Battle of the Planets"", music by Hoyt Curtin and Bob Sakuma two composers whose styles were compatible...originally conceived in 1972 from Japan with original television soundtracks...includes 45 minutes of previously unreleased tracks...featuring additional ""Battle of the Planets"" 2004 remix and ""The Ballad of 7 Zark 7"" remix performed by Ricardo Autobahn...includes trailers and Promo Spots...if you're a collector like me, this double CD package with original art is a ""film-score-buffs"" dream come true...produced by Reynold da Silva and Jason Hofius...compiled, edited and mastered by Rick Clark...just the way we like 'em!Total Time: 2-CD-Set ~ Silva America 1167 ~ (11/09/2004)"
4,Very scary and looks great,"I hadn't read much about this very slick film but I'm glad I caught it because it was a terrific couple of hours and in fact I'd love to see it again. First of all it's an original story idea but still works as a classic supernatural thriller horror kind of thing. Secondly you've got some great actors, quite a few new ones actually that I didn't recognize, and almost all of them give very convincing performances. And then of course you've got a load of action, special effects and good ol' scares all the way through. Basically its about some diamond prospectors who go missing and a security corps is dispatched out into the Namibian desert to find them. That's when everything starts to get crazy and slowly the situation gets out of control because of some kind of mythological and evil presence that's out there in the dunes. Some love stuff happens and then it's just down to three of them plus a pretty good climax down in an old abandoned mine."
3,Not too bad,"The premise for The Bone Snatcher is farfetched, of course, but imaginative. Ant-like creatures that eat human flesh, then join the bones together and walk like a man. Which is the more frightening, small creatures in swarms, or a walking skeleton, is debatable. The execution of the story is better than expected. The development of the characters isn't bad. Although definitely a ""B"" movie, this one does make it possible to suspend one's disbelief, even if for a short while."
5,Great Product!,"Biesemeyer 79-068 6-Foot Right 3/4-Inch Wide English Adhesive-Backed Measuring TapeThis is a great product. I bought some of these to replace the tape measures on our Biesemeyer table saw fences and they worked great. As a Matter of fact, it took almost fifteen years to wear out the first ones we bought, so I expect these will last just long.Important note: Biesemeyer makes some of the best saw accessories sold anywhere, period! They make allot of different accessories such as guards, fences, tape measures, splitters & riving knives, etc., and they all seem to work great and last a long time, even under heavy, industrial use. We use several different products of theirs in our shop. Their products are more expensive than their competitors, but if safety and accuracy are important to you, I believe that you should always choose Biesemeyer. I think that they have been bought out by Delta, but it hasn't changed the quality of their products so far."
5,Setting a trap for God?,Every person that says the Lord's Prayer should read this book. The reader comes to understand how truly spirtual the prayer really is. So much beauty has been lost in the way the prayer was translated that it seems bland after reading this book. I have introduced this book to my family and friends and every one is inspired by it. Read it. You will learn from it.
2,Some of the bits are ok.,"Some of the bits appear to be ok. Un fortunately when I first opened the wood case one of the wood mounts had broken free and a bunch of bits were rattling around in the box. That is bad for the sharp edges. The 1/4"" bit broke after about an hours use. Not to good. Spend a little more and get a good set if you plan on using it much."
3,I'm not sure where the other reviewer got his copy of,"the original novel (author, Brian Garfield), but mine most decidedly DIDN'T end with Kersey going to another city. In fact, it was, in a wierd way, even ""colder"" than the end of the film. That being said, this is, as you know, one of the original vigilante, one-man-gets 'em all films, a sort of Nevada Smith goes to Manhattan, with several really brutal scenes. Easily one of Bronson's better roles, and yes, you do find yourself alternately cheering and being a little horrified. Interestingly, a person couldn't do a Paul Kersey today, because most of the muggers are carrying guns as well... how's that for irony?"
5,The Original,"Standard Chuck Bronson shoot 'em up. Better then the sequels. Wouldn't bother with them, but this one is timeless."
3,Sinbad the Sailor-Waiting for the DVD.,"I have to give this kind of a low rating due to the poor quality of thisVHS tape. ( used VHS movies are a gamble anyway). Don't get me wrong! this is a terrific movie. I originally watched this on TV, recorded some of it and the Technicolor is superb. I recomend anyone interested in some of the better Maureen Ohara movies to obtain THIS MOVIE when it is avalable as a DVD."
3,A REAL BLAST FROM THE PAST,"THIS IS WHAT ALL THE NEW GUYS TRY TO DO AND JUST CAN'T QUITE MEASUREUP TO. THIS IS WHY WE CALL THESE MOVIES ""CLASSIC"". THIS IS WHY THERE ARE NO MORE GREAT ACTORS AND ACTORS IN HOLLYWOOD TODAY. HOW CAN YOU EXPECT SOMEONE LIKE SEAN PENN OR BRAD PITT TO DO A MOVIE LIKE THIS AND DO ALL HIS OWN STUNTS? FACE IT, FOLKS, WHAT WE CALL ACTORS TODAY JUST DON'T COMPARE TO THE REAL THING FROME A FEW YEARS BACK. WHY DO YOU THINK THEY CALL IT ""THOSE THRILLING DAYS OF YESTERYEAR?"""
5,Spice rack,"This spice rack for drawers is absolutely perfect!!! It solved the problem I had trying to find my spices in my cabinets. I could never see the one I wanted and I usually had to take some out to find the one I wanted.This fits in the drawer and all you need to do is open the drawer to see them. No more looking behind bottles, there right there where you can see them. Doesn't matter how short you are!! My compliments to who ever dreamed up this device!!! 5 stars is the highest rating, I'd give it 10 stars if I could."
5,Who doesn't like bridge!?,"Powerful and sought after method by Giorgio Belladonna and Walter Avarelli of the Italian bridge team which won 3 successive World Championships! Includes balanced distributions, unbalanced distributions, asking bids, overcalls & take-out doubles, play of the cards, tables, quizzes, and 5 championship games! Very nice layout, clear type. Great deal, recommended."
5,Good buy,"Received the product well packaged, spent about an hour to assemble and voila, my 3-yr old son started riding it right away. It's been about a month and he's having fun."
4,dont know why,i guess im like all the other guys who listen to female fronted metal bands but ive alwys love jack off jill and scarling was just what i needed to get my fix for jessicas voice. this cd rocks so does their full length buy it.
5,'Say Hello to my little freind...',"Honestly i dont really like scarling that much but these are some great songs on here. Very strange a cryptic, 'Band Aid Covers the Bullet Hole' has now become one of my all time favorite songs. Do yourself a favor and buy this awesome single."
2,Garbage,"I bought this camera when it first came out in 1998 for $700 + TAX!!!!This is what i got: Unnatural blurry pictures, 4 AA batteries run out after 10 shots, no options, slow shutter speed, zoom sucks, have to wait forever between pictures, uses old compact flash, slow transfer rate (serial port, 1 min per pic!), software sucks (wont install on newer versions of windows), no lens cap, nowhere to hold on while taking pictures.Please, go and get yourself a real camera. You can get one 10 times better for the same price. Try Cannon, Nikon, HP ...... Kodak is not the anwser!!!!!!"
5,Love this thing!!!,"Our baby boy is 7 months old, we started watching this DVD with him when he was around 3 months old. The older he gets, the more he LOVES watching it. It is really funny, he gets really mad when we try and distract him when the DVD is on. The only thing I do not like about this item is the blue belly button light, it is so bright it hurts my eyes. Not a big deal though, I usually cover it up with something..."
4,Wow!,"I'm still only a beginner in the learning of Hindi, but I bought this in preparartion for the time when I'm ready to move on from Snell's ""Teach Yourself"" and Bhatia's ""Colloquial Hindi"". I am very impressed with what I've seen of uit so far, and I am really looking forward to getting stuck into it. It really makes me want to move from beginner to intermediate, and that is a high ccompliment."
5,The Rays of Celestial Warmth,"Recorded in two sessions - November 1, 1978, and January 4, 1979 - the album yielded a defining song, Space Is The Place, within the vast discography of studio releases.Space Fling has a bouncy beat and Manhattan Cocktail - the longest piece - captures the future visions of Sun Ra. Flamingo and The Sunny Side Of The Street are more traditional in theory, but are intriguing intersections of the past with the present.Released in 1979, the oftentimes hard-to-find gem shows a master at work in the studio with a special artistic confidence to utilize a large canvas to capture celestial happiness."
3,"Although a classic, it did not entirely appeal to me","I saw this in a film class, and I know I'll be lynched for this, but I found it pretty draggy. There were some terrific scenes, and I think the cinematography was some of the best I'd ever seen (especially the dinner party scenes and how they flowed from one couple to the next so smoothly in was seemed like one take), I think this could have used a harsher edit. I can see how it is a classic, but scenes such as the rabbit hunting scene could have been trimmed down a bit. Perhaps I'm being too critical. Again, I was awed by the filming, but not by the movie itself."
5,"The best book on the topic, to date.","This is the second book on this topic I've read in the past two weeks and it's by far the best of the two. It's exactly what I was looking for; An insider's guide to BCT.The author addressed every question I had about BCT in a very practical way. He includes information on how to prepare yourself both mentally and physically for the specific demands of BCT. I highly recommend this book over 63 Days and a Wake-Up, which I found comparatively shallow."
4,Very Nice shelf,"Very easy to put together, beautiful coloring. Well-cut and fits perfectly where I want it to go. Spacious yet not extravagantly grand."
1,Sent it back,"Flimsy, poor craftsmanship, crappy wood. It was cracked in two places. Please! Don't throwaway the box in case you have to return it. I'm having to piece cardboard together to ship it back. Aargh!"
2,Garbage,"We buy a lot on Amazon, and rarely write reviews, but after receiving this gem, some comments were necessary. I don't know how anyone could give this item 3 to 5 stars, unless they received a totally different item than what we received. The only reason it didn't get 1 star, is because it looks like a shelf from a distance. The craftsmanship is terrible. Nothing lines up and there are gaps all over the place. I wouldn't spend $20 for this unit."
3,Good size,I needed a narrow tall shelf and this fits perfect in my space. It was easy to put together and a good value.
3,Painful installation and flimsy,"I didn't expect this shelf to be so painful to install. I have had my fair bit of experience assembling such stuff from Ikea, but this set even though it's just shelves, is a lot more complicated to assemble than one would expect. Anyway, after a good two hours or more of putting this together, finally tucked it away in the corner of the room where this was to go, only to find that it's not the most stable of shelves. It feels like it can fall off, and I'm nervous about it. Just left it there for now without anything on the shelves, I don't have the energy to disassemble it and return it."
3,ugly duckling,"OK. It IS a huge pain to assemble, but once you're finished, it's quite a nice looking piece of furniture. I just moved to NYC from DC...and had to compromise on approximately 550 sq ft of space, so I've lately been in the market for small multifunctional pieces for my tiny apt. This fit the bill perfectly. I also ordered the set of small baskets. This one is currently working in my ""kitchen"" and I'm ordering a second one for the bathroom.A few of the pieces did arrive slightly chipped, but it's wood, and it's not very noticeable."
2,Mediocre qualitry,"If it hadn't been so difficult after I'd opened I'd have sent it back. While it is real wood the quality of the wood is only fair and the quality of the finish isn't any better. I ended up with a small gap in the fit of a couple of the back spreaders, even after beating on with a rubber-headed hammer (and protecting the finish with a towel)and trying to pull it closer with a pistol grip clamp. It'll do in the bedroom but I'm disappointed."
3,Ian goes techno...kinda sorta,"The classic ""Give me Aqualung or Death"" Tull fans usually savage this disc...and with some understanding. Walk Into Light is very different, primarily because of the heavy contributions of Peter-John Vetesse's keyboards to Ian's voice and flute. That said, lyrically, this disc contains some very personal, literate comments and observations. It's an intelligent album. This was a worthy experiment that midwifed to the Techno-Tull album Under Wraps, another experiment which when combined with Martin Barre and David Pegg rocked out in a couple places. Not for everyone and not for me all the time, but it is a testament to Ian Anderson's abilities that he pulled off something so stunningly different."
3,Listenable,This is a mediocre album by Ian anderson considering his abilities.As a genuine tull fan I would rank this as an O.k album.The only catchy number is fly by night and other numbers are just listenable
4,ms v saitek,"The Microsoft stick is good if you are right handed. The only problem is that the controls are fairly ""loose"" thus you tend to over control until you learn to be very gentle. Small movements bring large control changes. the Saitek Cyborg 3D is stiffer so easier to control. If you are left handed it is the Cyborg hands down. I did not have any random imput problems with the Cyborg J13 as were reported above."
1,Good....for a while,"Ok I recieved this joystick a year ago for FS2002 and it was awesome. I used it for Battlefield 1942 and FS for a long time. Then, 3 days ago, I plugged it in and got no response. The drivers on Microsofts page were for the problem but only worked for Windows 95 or 98. Thanks Microsoft. Moral is: If you want a joystick for a short period of time, buy it. If not, get the new logitech wireless.It is a P.O.S."
1,Microsoft sidewinder does not work ......,"Pay attention. Microsoft Sidewinder does not work ! Drivers are out off date,microsoft develops no new version for the sidewinder joystick. The sidewinder with gameport connector does not work under windows XP !Maybe the USB version.Lots off people on different forums tell the same !And I heared more: under windows XP lots of microsoft game controllers dont work !So inform Yourself"
5,Rewatching the Beginning,It's amazing how rewatching the beginning of this fabulous series can make it seem so much better that we are where we are now. i love Friends. have for years but this DVD completes the obsession considering how much i've missed in the recent years of syndication. i'd recommend it to a friends lover and a newbie alike. :)
3,Wish they would have mastered it in hi-def first.,"Although the show looks painfully dated, it's still very funny and watchable, even in repeat viewings. I bought the entire series a season at a time for my wife and watched them with her. On our little 27"" tv they looked merely ""ok"" but on hour high-def 42"" they look awful. Even my $900 Oppo blu-ray player can't upscale them to clarity. Yeah, I know they're 4:3 ratio, yeah, I know they were likely shot on video but that's no excuse for this. I have loads of DVD's that look really good on my TV, these are barely watchable. Hopefully they'll fix it for a blu-ray release, but then I'll have to buy them all over again.One nice feature, continued playback. Just start one episode and only have to watch opening/closing credits once, the shows just flow right together until they all play (or choose one at a time form the menu.) Also some extra scenes edited seamlessly in."
3,"Good rent, but not a good buy","If you are looking for a fun rent this game delivers. The length, array of weapons and replay value keep this game from being a good buy. YOu can get the most out of this game in one rent, but buying it will likely leave you dissapointed."
2,Skip this one,"My husband and I purchased this book and took it back the next day.... The entire book simply repeats the same pictures of the same positions over and over, maybe varying them a little (and I stress little). We were looking for someting related to the art of Kama Sutra, made simpler than just reading the translation of the original. This book was a total disappointment...."
5,Very well done. Excellent modern interpretation of an ancient classic.,"Tastefully illustrated using live models. Not pornographic. The classic positions from the Kama Sutra are made modern & realistic in this edition. Fun, sexy reading for a loving couple on a cozy Saturday night. If you want porn, go somewhere else. If you want to see tasteful human illustrations and read detailed explanations of various positions, this book is for you."
4,Realistic Take on the Sutra,"This is an interesting book genre to review, as there is a LOT of books to choose from. I agree with some other reviewers - Hooper's style generally tends to be big on pictures and short on substance. However, this book does do an excellent job of realistically editing the Kama Sutra. Let's face it, some of the positions are just fantasies for almost everyone. For you Sutra purists out there, get a different book (you probably have three anyways). For those expecting a thorough scholarly analysis of these sexual positions, look elsewhere. For those simply looking to expand their perspectives on sex positions either to rekindle an existing relationship or please a new special someone, this is a good one. You'll probably learn at least a little bit even if you have been adventurous in the past. This is a good Hooper book worth buying."
5,Better Bath Deep Water Bath DOES MAKE MY BATH BETTER,"I love the Better Bath Deep Water Bath. I have a very deep tub but the overflow drain is placed lower then I would prefer, not allowing the tub to fill to the level I prefer. There are some lower star ratings for this product stating that the suction cups do no hold or slip. I have not had this problem at all and actually have left it in my tub over the overflow drain since I got it and it has not fallen at all.Great product to solve a simple problem. Works great!!"
4,Deep Bath- Great Product,"I got my product quite quickly and tried it out and was hard to get the suction cups to affix to the tub but when I run this plastic cover under hot water for a bit it softens it up and allows me to push each suction cup to the tub and covers the overflow. The only thing I don't like is the hole at the top because it is right where the tap is flowing water into the tub. I will likely cover it up with really strong tape so it won't fill up with water. Once you do all these things, it does block the overflow and works great for a deeper bath."
5,AWESOME!,This little thing raises my bath water a few inches higher - and that really does make a difference. LOVE IT.
4,overall good,product was delivered promptly. product is a bit stiff & some suctions are inverted and don't stick properly... overall though it does what it's supposed to...
2,"haha, make sure it'll fit over your drain!!! :)","This would be a classic example of: don't order things late at night without really thinking it through. I bought this for my deep claw foot tub so I could put more water into it... what I didn't figure was that my drain is wedged right underneath my faucet so there's no way I could fit the cover over it (DUH!!!). So, this may be an excellent product but I'll never know because I was a dope and didn't double check the size and layout of my tub drain :) Only wrote the review to potentially save someone else the hassle - will make a great gift for a family member or friend if I can find someone with a tub this will fit over! haha... oh well"
4,Wonderful,I hate that I can never get the bathtub to fill far enough to make it comfortable for me to soak. This product is great! I can now actually submerge completely under the water without it draining out.
5,"Franky, surprised. Very good quality.","I bought this on a whim thinking that if it didn't work it wasn't that much money just to try it. Well, I was wrong. It works like a charm. There's a hole in the side that you can position at the height desired so you will still have overflow protection. This was great for me because my overflow drain is much lower in the tub than I would like. Not only does this allow me to get a higher water level, the water seems to stay warmer longer. Not sure why that is; perhaps the absence of the draining? In any event, a very good purchase that does exactly what it advertises.Also, I really like that there are many small suction cups all around the rim. It gives a nice tight fit but makes it easier to remove for cleaning. It was a cinch to install. I simply dipped the rim in a bit of water to wet the suction cups, put it in place and pressed around the edges to push each suction cup. Took less than a minute and was completely secured."
2,Does the job,This works well in my bath tub. You make to let the tub fill first then get it wet and apply it. If you try to move it later it will let water in and it doesn't work as planned. In my opinion this should be a rectangle shape large enough to cover the circle. Then the outlet could be like a chimmy style opening. I still cant fill my tub to where I want to with this design.Follow up: a year later it doesn't work well... Lots of mold build up too. It falls off easily and lets water in
4,Great purchase,"I am a huge enjoyer of taking baths but I was always annoyed that my bath wouldn't get to a high enough point before the drain would start sucking the water out.This solves that problem except you can't have the hole at the highest point, like depicted in the picture, or the water will get into the hole (obviously).Also, there are quite a few small suction cups, more than I had expected, which can get tedious to press down.Just a few things I wanted to point out, not exactly complaints because I fully recommend this product if you would like to enjoy deeper baths.UPDATE: After a few uses, the ring containing the suction cups is starting to bend, making some of the suctions very difficult to press down. I was fretting that I would have to buy a new one after only a few uses. Moved the stars down to four."
3,Needs to be a bit bigger,"Surprisingly, this little device has a lot of potential. If your tub is relatively flat where the overflow cover is located, then this is probably a 4-star item and will likely work well for you. My tub, however, flares out a bit at the bottom of the overflow cover, so this item doesn't easily work for my tub.I modified the top of this product with a pair of scissors and was able to get it installed, and I was impressed with how well it worked. It was like being a kid again with water that actually covered me completely while seated."
1,Doesn't work,"This looks like a great product, but it doesn't work. It lets water leak in. Not worth the money."
2,Its just okay. Can't use it more than a few times.,"The first time I used it, it was great. no water got into the circle. But after i disconnected the item from the tub wall to wash it for the next time i took a bath, water kept leaking through. no matter how much i tried, whether applying it dry or wet- water just kept leaking through and now its useless.. Maybe the product just doesnt last long enough. I probably shouldnt have taken it off the tub.i dont know what went wrong because i read so many good reveiews before I bought it."
5,Works Great!,I love getting baths and this helps a lot! It almost feels as if I'm in hot tub instead of a shallow bath. It doesn't seal perfecly (but still works great) so eventually leaving it sit in the bath tub makes it dirty. I placed it in a bucket of bleach water and it came out perfect. This is such a great benefit to getting a bath I even bought one for my friend!
4,Good Book,"I thought the storyline was interesting. The only reason I give it four out of five stars is because I think the ending was a bit abrupt. It seemed like the last couple of pages did not have much time or thought put into them. There are typos too, but nothing crazy that makes any part of the book unreadable. I would recommend this book for a good read, but not as a five star recommendation."
5,Monkey Videos are Funny,"I watched this as a kid, so I was happy to see this go on sale.I think it is hilarious. I watch them with my 8 year old daughter and we laugh uncontrollably. I also watch them by my self and think they are hilarious.The big budget they enjoyed is reflected in the elaborate disguises and props used.It is well worth the money and you will be glad you bought this. You cannot get humor of this caliber just anywhere.The monkeys make the difference!Keith"
5,Secret Chimp,My daughter loved this series. So I bought it for her. She loves to see it over and over and I love watching it with her.
5,"memories on dvd, finally",my dad as i grew up taped a few of these episodes on scattered over a few vhs tapes. i always thought the show was silly and amusing. always made me laugh. making my friends watch this insane tv show with monkey detectives and they'd always laugh too. the evolution revolution is hysterical! i love this show. so glad to have it on dvd now instead of 5 different vhs tapes to search for it! :)
2,Read the book instead,How can they take such a good book and make such a lousy movie out of it? Of course it happens all thetime when movies are made from books.The acting in this movie is pretty bad and if you've read the book you feel like you're only seeing thehighlights.
4,This is a must for young people,"Actually I saw that movie when I was only 6 years old, but I perfectly caught the message and got so moved by the story that I knew I would never get involved in the vicious circle of drugs. I wish everybody could see the movie before the age of 10, or simply before it is too late."
3,this is not the cable for Cannon Burble,"this is not the cable for Cannon Burble. According to the product information, it's not for IEEE-1284 printer like Burble (also USB compatible). By the way, I haven't tried this cable... The information is just according to Tech data of the products."
3,Not the best in the series,"I have to say this book disappointed me. We're used to Gabe being an adolescent jerk, but he has grown to have so many rotten characteristics, you have to wonder why a supposedly smart woman like Benni even sticks with him. He's supposed to be some brooding mystery man always on the verge of an emotional breakthrough, but basically he's just a verbally abusive guy who is always dismissive of anything Benni does. And in return, Benni fawns all over him, still mesmerized by how sexy he is. Puh-leeze. In the real world, no smart woman would think his constant nastiness would be remotely sexy. The plot was okay but pretty easy to figure out, and I missed reading more about Dove and Emory. Elvia just came off as a shallow nitwit, which was also disappointing."
2,Not the best in the series,"This series is usually well-written with interesting plots and good character development. Unfortunately, this entry fell short. The ""mystery"" wasn't strong enough to keep the plot moving, so there was a lot of extraneous details about Benni's many errands, and too much focus on the new puppy. Normally in this series, there is good interaction between Benni and Gabe, so that their relationship continues to grow. Here, there was very little interaction between the two, and Gabe seemed one-dimensional. The ending felt rushed and seemed at odds with the way the story was driven from the beginning. I would recommend the series but this entry can be skipped."
2,Tumbling Blocks,"I am a true Benni Harper fan and every May I can't wait until her new mystery is available for me to read. However, Tumbling Blocks falls well below my expectations! Nothing happends--I kept turning the pages to finally get into the book only to have nothing happen. It is a very bland storyline with a very simple climax. I found little depth to the characters and walked away from the book with no sense of growth in my relationship with any of them."
2,no title,"I found it very slow. covering a time span of 19 years over which nothing much happened, yet the end when it came was absolutely stunning and totally tragic. Not a happy ending at all, at all. And Gurr's way of writing was so irritating, short choppy little sentences that assumed you knew what he was talking about, when in fact more than a few times I hadn't a clue. References to things I did know, and didn't. First purely spy novel I've read since ""A Perfect Spy, by Le Carre, and that really was more of a character study than plot. This guy just talks the talk and I ain't in on it. If you were an ex-spy, or a naval person, then maybe. Gurr is an ex-naval person. This is his first novel and there were more on the shelves. He is now a architect. Go figure. (My husband, to be fair, read it in a few days, liked it, and understood it. He is ex-Air Force.)"
5,Delightful!!,I have recently come out of the closet and this book made me feel right at home. The intimacy made me call my girlfriend for a night of passion that I will never forget!! Thanks Mr. Jackson for adding the needed spice to my relationship!!
1,Not Erotica,"Is this erotica? I highly doubt it. It's the story of a poor, black, teenager in the south; her family relationships and those of her friends. The writing is choppy, and the writer spends way too much time with details that do not add to the story. Who wants a paragraph on cleaning your teeth? The main character, Tanya, thinks and talks like a twenty-something black man! She's supposed to be a teen and female! From a cultural standpoint,it's revealing.As far as erotica, don't waste your money."
4,supralingua is making me bounce in my seat,"An incredible mix of drums, voice samples, electronic mastering and real life soul. bought it on a whim, on advice from a guy in the record store, and now i've just bought 3 more drum/mickey hart cds.... really really worth it. and this is a good price."
1,Stick to being a drummer,"Dear Lord, My IQ must have dropped at least 10 points for listening to this album. The good news however is that judging from the lyrics on this album my IQ would still be at least 100 points higher than Edsels."
1,What Happened?,I am a fan of their earlier albums. When Group Therapy came out it seemed there was potential to evolve from a good to an exceptional band. Then American Apathy was released and fell completely flat. It sounds as though they just didn't care about the music anymore. All integrity and creativity gone. There are a few ok remixes of older songs.
4,"Two great songs, too short to pay 5.49 for.","This little Cave In single is great (except for it's short lifespan). I wish they had released an EP with at least 4 songs instead of just two, but it will do. Cave In have always been amazing and unique artists and this is just a little showcase of their talent. Especially, on ""Lift Off"" which will be on repeat for awhile. I suggest buying it, but try someplace where it's a little cheaper. No matter how good, almost 6 bucks (not including shipping) is too much. But this CD is still top-quality."
4,"Very Good Collection - My Favorite Is ""Large Bus Rider""","This has about eleven phone pranks by Willie. Many of them are very good to excellent. My favorite in this bunch is ""Large Bus Rider."" Willie has a very unique humor with good timing on the phone - just delightful. I have listened to 10 - 15 of his collections. They are good clean fun."
3,Stick to the books...,"I am a huge fan of the Kare Kano series so I have both the DVD and the Manga versions. I am very disappointed of the DVD because more than half of it is made up of ""Play Backs"" and ""Previews."" DVDs 1 to 3 were okay but come DVD 4 and 5, I guess the creators got pretty lazy so they cut out some Yukino and Arima drawings and made some puppets out of it... some parts, also as bad, is when they just pasted pictures from the Manga version, added some background music and some narration. What was that? So I guess 1 Star for every ""good"" DVD would suffice... The manga version is so good so to make sure that you get the most out of Kare Kano (and make sure you catch the best of it!), read the Manga FIRST and then MAYBE you can watch the DVD..."
2,It's still just fizzy water,"Badoit is refreshing and has delightfully small bubbles. Is it worth this much money? Well, writing from Paris, where Badoit is cheap and plentiful, people seem to like Perrier and San Pellegrino just fine. Given that home carbonation can make perfectly good soda for very little money, I would have to suggest saving your hard-earned cash for a decent bottle of wine."
5,Good introduction,"It is a good brief introduction to Neurology, applicable more toward students and non neurology residents. It has five chapters: Basic, H & P, Investigation, Problemes, then Syndromes and Diseases, organized in topics, each conatins high quality tables, graphs, images, and a simple text rich in helpfull, to the point information. Being only 130 pages will allow reader to finish in short time making it a good prepartion before neuoroly rotation."
3,?,"I thought that the plates were flimsy , not durable. If i had known this i would not have bought them. They are OK i guess."
2,Generic nock off!!,Cable is not a Belkin and is NOT snagless. At least they got the color right. A good price but the description is a LIE.
5,Works perfectly. Great value.,Works perfectly. Great value. Connecting internet modem to TV in living room via basement in order to use Netflix/Pandora. Blue makes it easy to recognize what it is if we ever have to distinquish it from other lines.
5,Internet Extension,I bought this for the areas of my house the wireless has trouble. It works great and the blue looks more exciting than geek grey. The only problem with using it occassionally is there is 50 feet of cable you have to wrap up or store. It would be great if there was a wheel to wind it up on like the garden hose.
1,Don't bother,"Bought the Calming Cap in hopes it would relax our Labradoodle in the car and stop him from drooling like Niagra Falls. No effect at all. It was a complete waste of money. Even outside the car it had no effect, plus he found a way to remove it in less than 10 seconds."

4,Infertility Mystery,"The mystery in this novel centers around the fertility industry and the author did her research. You'll be impressed with the level of knowledge and detail she imparts about the steps infertile couples take to have ""One of My Own"", all the while trying to figure out the various plot twists. And the plot does twist! It's a fast read you'll find hard to put down. Take it on vacation with you. I did."
4,"The Beef Jerky Gun is Great! The Included Spices, Not So Much...","The Jerky Gun is great. I've made a few rounds already and this little fella takes about 1lb of ground beef and spits out jerky strips onto your dehydrator. Easy to clean, does what it says.The Spice Packets aren't so great. They contain MSG and Sodium Nitrite. I'm sure they'll taste excellent, but if you're like me, the reason you got into making jerky is for the health and cost benefits AND to get away from nitrites and MSG. These (potentially) tasty little spice packets contain both. And trying to obtain the ingredient information took some time!So, if you're buying it for the gun like I did, you'll be happy. But if you're doing it for the kit, beware of the unhealthy spice packets. There are PLENTY of good recipes that don't call for nitrites and MSG."
4,Fun for kids,"I really enjoyed reading this book for my daughter who is 5. She and I had lots of laughs, but I am concerned about how many times this character uses the word STUPID. I would want to make parents aware, especially those whose child receives this as a gift as mine did. That way they could prepare their child that although Junie uses it without a care, we do not."
1,"Barbara, if you can't keep your target audience intrested, then stop trying.","I read this book about four years ago. I hated it, as JBJ would say, becase she apparently hates the universe.I only read two or three chapters before I stopped. I remember thinking, ""Seriously?! Grown ups expect us to like this?"". Grammatical errors and spelling mistakes have always been pet peeves of mine, even back when I read the book in 1st grade. JBJ was also a brat, and made some pretty ridiculous, ignorant, and illogical decisions (Did you really just try to clean your shoes by licking them? Were you really about to eat candy from off the ground? Why would your mom be talking about BATHROOM emergencies when she taught you how to call 911?).I didn't like the series, and the JBJ 1st grade version was worse.So if you're a fan of the series, stop reading now. Trust me, it's for your own good."
1,Why bother??,"The author tries to be cute by making grammatical errors much like a 3 or 4 year old would. Can a child learn good grammar by reading a book with bad grammar? I suppose, if errors were corrected as they are encountered. I must admit that I do not feel as though I am enriching my kids life with any book in this series. There are enough good childrens books available that I say, ""Why bother??""."
1,You have got to be kidding me!,"My daughter just started kindergarten and is participating in a school wide reading program to read for 20 minutes a day. Since she is past the 'little kids' books as she puts it, I told her we would read 'big girls' books with chapters. This series was recommended for K-3. I am with the other reviewers that gave the book 1 star. I was horrified!!! I too had to change the dialogue quite a bit. The words stupid and hate are not words I approve of for a child just starting school. I also don't like the word bestest. These are children learning how to read and to use proper English, you would think a book towards their age group would be AGE appropriate. I will not be purchasing any more of these books and will not recommend them to anyone!"
2,Elusive is Correct,"If I hadn't already read the book and watched the movie version with Jane Seymour and Anthony Andrews, this would have been a hard movie to follow. David Niven does a great job acting for the time period it was filmed (1950) but the VHS is blurry and the audio is not great.Best off to buy the VHS or DVD version of ""The Scarlett Pimpernel"" with Jane Seymour. It is most entertaining and I never get tired of it."
2,"Good Seller, Mediocre Book","Seller experience was great.The book, on the other hand, is just mediocre. It's very thorough in proofs and heavy in higher level math. My biggest complaint is that the book has VERY FEW examples and fails to relate the math to real world things. It written very abstractly, despite representing real materials."
1,Poor Book,Lacks worked out examples. Problems often ask qauestions referring to information presented in following chapters. Very poor book
2,Not very good material.,"The first thing I have ever returned to Amazon. The material is thin- not worth the price. Buy a different hammock.On the upside, the company was very accommodating about me returning it- was well over 30 days and no problem with getting my money back!"
1,ARE THEY KIDDING?,THE INFLATED RING ON THIS THING IS ONLY ABOUT 1 AND 1/2 INCHES WIDE. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME. BAD DESIGN.
2,It's a one way fax machine,"You could accomplish the same thing (basically) by buying a color fax machine. And, your relatives could reply if they wanted to. Or by sending regular mail. I agree that it is an easy system, but the monthly fee adds up and I do not believe you are getting $100 in value each year using Presto's compiler and timed delivery."
3,Watch out for an extra expense!,"After purchasing the Presto Mailbox and installing it for my parents, it would not work. After several phone calls to Presto, they informed me I had to purchase a digital to analog converter for the mailbox to work since my parents had digital phone and television from AT&T. That was another $125.00 expense I was not expecting. A Presto employee said she had noticed many customers had not been informed of this possible added expense."
2,High Maintenenct,The problem with this device is that the ball is very smooth and will slip if it gets the least little bit of grease on it from a skip cream or even eating a potato chip. I use the mouse all day and had to switch to a trackball to avoid repetition injury. The only other mouse I've used is Logitech which is an optical mouse and requires no reqular cleaning. I'd definitely not buy Microsoft if you're a heavy user.
4,Going to have to read this again,"I don't know. I gave it four stars because I didn't think I caught everything. But thinking about it now I keep coming across little details and alternate story lines that mesh together and solidify as Quint crosses the country. There is so much detail and every character seems to have another story lurking in their background that Quint is too oblivious to pick up on. For now, it's definately a four, I'm definately going to come back to it later on. Plus the beach at the end is right by my house."
1,Pure filth,This book was recommended to me by one of the ladies in my book club. I found it vulgar and trashy. Smoking and swearing as if this is a way for you main character to behave. I know that none of the teens I know act in such a way. Disgusting.
3,Weird,"I have read many of Joyce Carol Oates books. The first being, ""We Were the Mulvaney's"" - a book I loved. This book we are discussing now, ""Heat"", is a book of short stories. Each one is intriguing until you get to the end and you can say, huh? I don't really know the meaning of any of the stories in this book. Joyce Carol Oates is a masterful story teller - no doubt about it. I just wish she wasn't quite so macabre."
1,Poor machine,"The Honda powered Mantis worked well for perhaps 3 months. Then the motor started to cut out when giving it full throttle. Several owners have reported this problem. I Assumed this was varnish deposits from ethenol in the gas so I stripped, soaked and cleaned the carb but no difference. I then bought a new carb which did the same thing after only 3 weeks. Besides the crap Honda motor the Mantis stainless steel blades bend very easily and have to be twisted back straight every time you use it. The handles of the machine twist out of alignment and need a better way to secure them.All in all this machine is expensive and poor quality. I was fooled into thinking a Honda engine was the best you can buy, perhaps the two stoke version is more reliable. I would not buy this machine."
2,Brick of Egypt,I did not like this game that much. It's somewhat boring. Does not teach anything. I prefer the Seven Wonders of the World where one can also learn about these wonders.
1,infected game,I bought this game and we just found out from Verizon after we got a virus and paid to have them go through our PC. There is a INTERNET Tracking VIRUS Attached to this Game. Do not Buy And Install it is a Bad Game. Ours is going in the Trash.
5,Great find,I happened to walk into a bar one night during a visit to NYC and caught these guys in the middle of a set. I was so impressed by the free flowing energy of their songs that I hunted down a copy of their CD. You can't help but get caught up in the rhythm and pulse Shagg generates. I can't listen to the CD without finding some part of my body grooving along with their music.
4,Kodak Xenar Telephoto Lens,As far as my product I am satisfied with it. The only thing I dislike about it is my camera is a lot heavier with it on. I would recomend any one that orders to make sure they came ship thru the postal service for you can ship priority and get your merchandise within 2 - 3 days and it does not cost near as much as you would pay thru other companies.
2,Touchy scroll wheel quickly annoys,"I have an IntelliMouse at home that I love so I decided to buy another for work, unfortunately this mouse has a scroll wheel that is difficult to turn, and is easy to press. This combo results in several unintentional clicks, causing annoying behavior in applications. At times I feel it?s easier to scroll with the scroll bars (which defeats the purpose of getting a wheel mouse). I would recommend passing on this version, and shopping for a better built wheel mouse."
5,Fascinating Story!,"A very well crafted story/documentary told by one of the few people who had any insight into the life of this spymaster... his son. I doubt very many people had any idea who William Colby was, what a mysterious life he led before he became Director of the CIA. I was fascinated by the story of his life."
4,Very satisfied,I'm very satisfied with this product. It's the third time I by it and Iwant to continue. I thnik that is one of the bests Vitamin C I know.
1,sugar cubes,"Complete waste of money. Cubes were so small as to be unusable for any decorative purpose. Seller should have stated that these are ""store bought"" cubes with tiny, tiny decor added, some of which didn't survive shipping."
3,"Some problems, poor service policy, impressive specs","I just bought one of these units. When I unpacked it and bolted the wheels on, I discovered that the bracket which holds the wheels on had been welded onto the tank crooked. As a result it stood at an angle, resting on only one of the rubber feet. The other one was about a half inch off of the ground. I was able to correct the problem by re-drilling one of the wheel mounting holes. Hopefully rest of the tank was welded with a bit more care.Be warned, the Porter Cable service policy as stated in the manual is essentially: Don't return a defective unit to the retailer. Call Porter Cable to find the nearest service center. You pay the shipping(not cheap on a 130 pound compressor).The SCFM spec is impressive, more so than similarly priced units. I have not used the unit much yet but expect it to serve well in the light-duty role for which I bought it."
1,Last Porter Cable Tool I Purchase,"I am in the process of priming/painting moulding in my garage to be nailed up in the house I just built. Had a similar Craftsman that lasted me about 8 yrs and just broke. So, this time I ordered this one from Tool Crib. It lasted a total of 4 months before breaking down yesterday. It is still under the warranty so I phoned Porter Cable. They said I have to take it to a certain nearest service center which happens to be a 4 hr drive from where I live. Or, I can ship it to them if I pay the shipping. So, I ended up driving to the nearest town today to buy a new compressor of a different brand. Pretty darn poor service. What do I expect you might ask? I expect them to let me take the brand new thing to any near by place that can fix it and have the bill sent to them! I have purchased a lot of Porter Cable tools while building this house but that compressor was the last one!"
4,Lives up to it's name,"Although you may need additional warm-up and cool down time, if you're new to the workout scene, this is the video to get. Leslie shows the most effective, efficient and time-tested ways to tighten and tone our major muscle groups. Her team consists of women of different sizes and ages which can be quite beneficial to all users. Her demeanor is friendly and upbeat, yet no nonsense and her form is perfect. This video is definately a must-have for beginners."
3,Please enter a title for your review,"relatively original for a teen book. the part on high school social dynamics covers some familiar ideas but is detailed enough to have depth. the most insightful part is maybe the rejecting of the myth of the dork pining after the 1 perfect popular girl (the reality of course being that the pining more likely extends to half the girls in school). the mystery part is poorly thought out though, stacking up question after question that the book ends without answering, and the father figure issue is a bit shallow and generic. it's a shame the author didn't put the book through a couple more drafts because it seems like he can write well when he puts his mind to it."
3,okay,"I'm stunned by the glowing reviews this book got. I found it an easy read and definitely laughed out loud a couple of times, but overall, it came across as shallow, repetitive, and somewhat pointless. I kept waiting for more to happen with Tom's investigation of his father's life and death and in the end it turned out to be more of a McGuffin than anything else. Most of the characters were one-dimensional and the main character was neither interesting nor relatable."
4,Very Funny and Smart,"I enjoyed this book a lot--smart, original and funny. Not a whole hell of a lot happens, but it's all about the characters and writing here. A great talent in Portman. Can't wait to see what he does next. Long live The Chi-Mos!!"
4,Celebrating Dorks and other Misfits,"Clever book that explores the world of the `dorky' kid in high school. Tom Henderson is not popular and suffers the abuse of the `psycho normals' who rule the daily universe, but he is not subjected to the horrors they visit on the handicapped and even lower-rung social pariahs. Tom and his friend Sam plan their rock band's albums, and navigate the outer circle of drama / hippie dorks. Refreshingly, Tom does not plan suicide or murder, but instead just hangs in, and is eventually rewarded with an introduction to girls and sex. He even makes better adjustments in his family life - there is a subplot that drives the story involving Tom's efforts to `solve' his father's death - Tom actually makes some healthy adjustments to his mom, sister, and the mom's second husband by the book's end. Situations are played for laughs, and the glossary at the end of the book is full of hilarious definitions related to the book."
4,Language Arts Superior WI,"""This is a very interesting book, it relates to what a high school that i go to is like with AP class. I cant wait to read the end of the book."""
5,I love this book more than toast,"Frank Portman's debut novel is equal parts George Bernard Shaw and D. Manus Pinkwater. My favorite part was when the protagonist had to choose between the blue pill or the red pill. Also when the cat starts talking. That part's cool too. But when it gets back in the present tense, it's meaningless. Meaningless."
1,A huge disappointment,"The nomination of this film for an Academy Award and the effusive praise of two Amazon reviewers baffle me. There isn't a single line of dialogue that could be called inspired; the characters are paper-thin; the tone of the movie is unvarying and the pacing glacial. It would have been enlightening to learn of the Swiss government's true policies with respect to Jewish refugees, but the stern actions of one policeman can hardly serve as an indictment."
1,Sounds like Friday sat down with gin and a tape recorder,"I'll keep it brief. The Booklist review was right. I thought I'd get intelligent, psychological discourse on how beauty affects our lives. Instead Friday uses it as an excuse to wax poetic about her childhood. It sounds like she sat down with a girlfriend, a bottle of booze and a tape recorder and just blabbed. It should've been called, ""Everything You Already Knew About the Power of Beauty But Were Too Lazy to Write 400 pages about""."
1,An Orientalist construction of Hinduism,This is much better than what used to be written on Hinduism in the West. But Flood still has to travel some more distance. This book still speaks of the Aryan invasions although archaeologists have abandoned that racist theory.
3,Not Too Shabby,"Flood's writing is very dry, but he certainly knows what he is talking about. This book is not so much an introduction for people looking to learn something new, but a great reference for those hoping to learn more."
1,Biased,"This book is well written, but is severely biased towards conventional American medical practises. The author has no understanding or experience with the different types of medicine he describes, and has very little understanding of the healing process and how to work with it. Read it but be very cautious of his bias."
1,IS HE A CHIROPRACTOR?,"After reading this book, it is so obvious that the author/s know nothing about chiropractic. Have they ever even been treated by a chiropractor? It is also not very professional for one doctor to condemn another. I am an orthopaedic surgeon and I refer many of my patients to be treated by a chiroractor before the final choice of surgery. After giving a lecture at a chiropractic college in Japan, I was amazed that the doctors know as much about my job as I do! But how much does the author know about chiropractic? It is books like this that keeps modern medicine in the dark ages. Some doctors are even ignorant about the fact that HIV is the cause of AIDS! I have a copy of this book at home which I bought for 5 Dollars in a second hand book shop; if anybody wants a good laugh at a doctors ignorance, you can have mine for a buck!"
1,Good for those who also think Cheerios are a Communist plot,"Dr. Barrett issues venom upon ANYTHING he considers alternative medicine to gain public attention and this book is no exception. If you see government plots underneath your pillow, then this paranoid peice of misinformation will be right up your alley. For the rest of you, check more reputable sources. Webmd.com, for example, is building a relatively large database of articles on alternative health care."
1,The Minature Version of REAL keyboards,"My last keyboard was a Digital Research Erog Multimedia/Internet Pragramable Keyboard. After one of my parents spilled coffe on it I was forced to shop for another, and got the microsoft one. After using such a good ergo keyboard that was in the traditional design, I can't stand this one, the keys are too small on many parts, and arrow keys are a CRUCIAL part of first person gaming. There is no reason to have these keys so small, and rearanged the way they are. I also fail to see the reason for making the ALT and adjacent keys so large. Good for someone who uses spreadsheets all day maybe, but not very good for a gamer, I also don't like the small size of the enter key and the slightly smaller backspace than traditional IBM keyboards."
2,Save the trees,"I too found the long source code listings of this book peculiar. One of the main problems I also found with this book was that the author didn't go into deep detail with any of the aspects of MFC programming. He simply gave one or two short (and I found ludicrously easy) examples, then finished up with some lame statement such as ""now you're a C++ pro.""I was surprised that I could read a 500 page book so quickly, but then I realized that half of it was just the useless source code I skipped. Save the trees, and find a book with some real content."
5,Happiness is having all of Wodehouse to read,"Wodehouse wrote a LOT of stories, books and even screen plays (the musical ""Anything Goes"" is Cole Porter setting a Wodehouse story to music- but Wodehouse also contributed to ""Showboat"" and other Hollywood classics). He is beyond doubt the ultimate writer if one wants to read for amusement."
5,The recipient loved it!,Bought for a 4 year old whose parents sent a Christmas video of him swinging a sword and dancing to the Pirate music. He absoluterly loves this!
1,Useless,"Purchased this extender a couple of weeks ago, tried it out today and after screwing in the third screw the extender snapped in two. Recommend purchasing a different brand"
3,flex bit..,"Received it, looks good, but its much stiffer than it looks, which makes handling it abit awkward since you have to you alot of force to hold the bend/flex in place while you screw it. good magnet though, my bit is stuck right on it. Also great that it only rotate internally and not affect your holding on to it. Would be better if it held in place after i flexed rather than needing to hold on to it (with much force too)."
5,Long.,"War and Peace is a long book. I mean it is long. Very long. Long, long, long, long, long. Way long. Not only is it long but it's got a lot of Russian names in it. I mean a lot. Now don't get me wrong, I know it takes place in Russia and most of the characters are Russian and it was written by a Russian in Russian, but still give me a break. War and Peace is a long book very long with a lot of Russian names a lot. This is my review of War and Peace, a long book with a lot of Russian names."
2,"Dull Read, Why Bother, Get Cliff Notes","What kind of simpletons have to use the constant phrase, ""The Best Book of All Time""? Truly, Tolstoy's work is nothing but a meager, self-sustaining, turgescent waste of time examining the life of reckless, debauched aristocrats who sit around and drink tea all day and call Napolean an ""anti-christ"". I was forced to read it in school and I dread the fact. There's only so much of this one can stomach before passing it off as an ""old man's delusion""."
2,Scene deleted,"The movie itself is a descent copy, but the famous nunchaku scene depicted on the cover is deleted. Sad when you wait the whole movie for a specific scene and some one decides to hijack it. NO BUENO!!!"
3,Needs more story and less politics,"I have read every work of fiction that I can find that Father Greeley has written, and I love the Father Blackie mysteries. However, I was disappointed in this book because so much time was devoted to promoting the Democrats as victims of a vicious Republican conspiracy. I have always known that Father Greeley was a Democrat, but this was a bit much. It seemed he even went so far as to imply that maybe our former president was not guilty of some of the moral decadence that he finally admitted to, but was really set up by the Republicans of that time period. If you can get past or ignore the political chapters, the Father Blackie story is a good one. I hope this was a one time only jaunt into this level of politics or I may have to find another favorite author."
1,The Bishop should take an eternal sabbatical!,"This was a very thin and obvious story -- I figured out who the perp was after the vice president and her daughter were initially introduced. I agree with all the points made with another reviewer who gave this novel two points. Especially on how Andy portrays certain people in a sterotypically fashion. However, I have a stronger dislike for novels written by liberals who use them as political platforms. Seems history was trying to be rewritten here, and a sickly yearning back to the Days of Camelot were very much evident and not appreciated by this reader. Overall this was a stupid and ignorant novel."
1,A mish-mash of poor theology and poor science,"While perpetuating a few scientific myths such as ""ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny"" and Dyson's speculative open universe/evolving God, Matt actually uses this book primarily to expound the philosophy and theology of his personal brand of Jewish mysticism. The book is probably 80% Matt's personal, self-contradictory Kaballah handbook with 20% poor science thrown in for advertising value"
1,Filler...,"No offense meant to other reviews but frankly this album falls flat. I have bought a fair amount of what is commonly called ""Trip Hop"" and ""Nu-Jazz"" and found this to be among the least compelling records I own. Furthermore, to compare this with Miles Davis (even in his *least* interesting periods, let alone Kind Of Blue & Sketches Of Spain) is blasphemy of the highest order ; )Again, no offense meant - just want others to know that other choices are probably better.It's not that this disc is horrifyingly bad: but in the end it just really feels like filler - background music... and not really good background music at that."
4,UH!OH.Jake is a controller.,This book is so good. Jake becomes a controller.Read this book to find out what happens to the Animorphs.
5,AWESOME!!!,I really feel sorry for Jake. He was hit by a sledge hammer in the head. His friends come to his rescue by holding off some people. This book is a must read and part of an excellent series you should collect
5,The best in the Animorphs series!,This is a great book and once you start reading it it is impossible to put it down. Jake finds out a plan that the Yeerks have to infest the govener. This is a big problem because the govener is running for president the next year! When the Animorphs try to stop the Yeerks Jake ends up with a Yeerk in his head. To find out what happens read the book. I can garante that you will enjoy it
3,"A half-hearted attempt, that capitalizes on Robuchon's name.","A large formated book with some sketch plates of shellfish, vegetables etc. Instead of a cookbook I would term the work a walk through the food classes. A noble attempt at conitinuing to educate the reader on the different ways to look at food. However, for a chef of Robuchon's quality and popularity, the reader is left with a feeling of being jipped. Not really getting any more personal cooking tips, or recipes that made him famous. This might have been a better third effort, not second. Your money is better spent elsewhere."
2,Disappointed,"I personally did not care for the video A Girl of the Limberlost. Although Elnora did persevere through hardships at school and learned some valuable lessons, I felt the movie did not stay true to the book. For example, instead of Freckles being a person, he was an owl. And the Bird Woman was Gene Stratton Porter, the authoress of the book, just to name a few. Moreover, Elnora was not the same type of person as she was in the book. In the book, she was a well rounded girl who was intelligent, beautiful, and who had grown and matured by the hard knocks given to her by her mother. In the movie she seemed whiny and sorry for herself all the time. If you have not read the book and want a country 1900s movie that has some good morals, this is for you; however, if you are looking for the movie to have the same magic and wonder of the book, you will be sorely disappointed."
1,Quite simply dreadful - how about no stars?,"I'm having trouble accepting that the writers of this film actually read the book on which it was based. Other than mother-daughter conflict, an interest in nature, and the time period in which it was set, the book and the movie have almost nothing in common. Most of the important characters are missing, key plot elements have been left out, and the personalities of the characters who do remain have been distorted beyond recognition. I find myself wondering why they made the movie at all. No one who loved the book would find anything appealing in this disappointing effort. My real regret is that someone might see this movie before reading the book. They would never want to pick up the novel."
1,worst sherinian solo album,i like all of derek's albums to one degree or another and have heard his planet x stuff as well. blood is by far his worst and most boring work. the synth tones and note choices are redundant and unnecessarily overplayed. some of the guitar work as the song with john petrucci is okay but too much sax and non-metal sounds abound this cd. derek plays too much unmelodic stuff and the vocal tracks are blah. in the summertime with billy idol is laughable indeed. the song with zakk is ok i guess. i recommend you check out inertia and the first album by derek. this one seems rushed and boring.
1,The Stomp (The Soul Assassins Collection),"This title and the other DVD's that came up with the search, as well as the lack of information can lead one to believe this is a video starring the group ""Stomp"". It is, in fact, a martial arts film that has nothing to do with music. I did not watch it, so this review isn't about the content of the video...just a warning to potential buyers. I bought it under the ""new and used"" section and was told by the seller that in returning it I would have to pay a re-stocking fee as well as all shipping charges which will probably amount to the price of the video. More information about the DVD could have prevented this."
2,THE GAMES AFOOT,"To GHOST GAME's credit, I didn't cut it off; it entertained me enough to make me stay with it. BUT..what a lame movie. A plot that makes little or if any sense; actors whose talents are minimal; and sloppy direction and editing. Three witches back in the mid-seventies were killed during some kind of ritual, but we're not really sure what, and even though by the end of the film, we ""kinda"" figure out who killed them, it still doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Then we have the typical group of college students (none who look under the age of 30) who for whatever reason decide to go spend a weekend at this camp where the witches died, and lo and behold, they find some kind of weird game which releases the witches and spells doom for the cast. There aren't a whole lot of scares and the pacing isn't quick enough to generate any suspense, but there are a lot worse movies out there, so fans of this type of occult thriller may find themselves mildly diverted."
3,i'm sure the trap is great but...,the seller didnt include instructions. i mean... they kinda failed to mention that even a 260lb MAN cant even set this trap... i should know because my little 124 lb self couldnt do it and had to ask my cousin to help.... and we still couldnt set it. so i tossed it into a box in the shed. maybe one day... but i'm too frustrated right now to bother.i'll just stick with big cage type traps or coon cuffs.
4,"It works, it's small","Well, it's not hard to design and make a small air compressor. Porter cable offers a nice portable unit here (with wheeled movement). I quickly have outgrown with tank capacity, but that's my fault, not Porter Cable.My machine is darn loud and for that reason is not 5 stars. Someday, someone with make a quieter motor for these things.I'm a woodworker and use the compressor for everything from nailing to spray finishing. Do yourself a favor and get a larger tank unit."
1,No way to know,Arrived seriously damaged. Replacement arrived out of box and more seriously damaged. Missing parts.Red Paint Chips in what was left of box.Box was retaped w/ Wide Plastic Tape by Shipper.Do not order this item from Amazon!! They are not capable of shipping it successfully.I buy a lot of other items from Amazon and am a loyal customer but will never order another large item
1,Do children need adult poetry?,"This series is lacking in several respects. The illustrations are beautiful but are geared more toward nostalgic adults than children. This particular book reflects what is wrong with several titles in the series: poems chosen because adults have an affinity for them rather than because they will appeal to children. One of the poems in this book is ""The Emperor of Ice Cream"" about the death of a poor woman, possibly a prostitute, surrounded by her poor neighbors trying to spiff up her house by bringing in flowers wrapped in month-old newspapers while the ""roller of cigars"" whips ""concupiscent curds""in plain old cups in her kitchen. In which world do our children care to read about ""concupiscent curds"" and the death of a poor old woman? Let us hope they don't understand these words just yet. If you choose any of these titles, the least offensive is about Robert Louis Stevenson."
4,Superb performances.,Followed the historical sequence of events ver accurately. Annette crosbie played.....Annette crosbie! Not my favorite choice for the part really.
3,"A Great Docu-drama, but . . .","I share the raves with the other reviewers, but the series is recorded in the SLP (EP) mode, so the quality is not that great."
2,Only One year warranty,"Home Depot now has a Generac 14 hp engine/generator #1470 with a 2 year warranty and is selling it for about 1150. This includes a cable, wheel kit and it is electric start. Generac says this is for Home Depot only,you have other names, but not the warranty. I am afraid for the money, warranty and electric start nothing you have compares."
3,"nice story, pretentious writing style","If you can get past the pretentious writing style, the book is worth reading for the story line and characters."
2,Intriguing views - but one big run-on sentence,"I enjoyed the author's refreshing perspective on being a step-mom, a friend, a wife, and overall a woman. I could have done without some of the swearing. But the one major problem I had with this book which caused me to repeatedly re-read not only paragraphs but full pages, was her disruptive use of commas and run-on sentences. I found it a very rough read."
5,The College Blue Book by Thomson Gale,"32nd edition, 2005, 6 volumes, almost 6000 pages total.HardbacksVol. 1: Narrative DescriptionsVol. 2: Tabular DataVol. 3: Degrees Offered by College and SubjectVol. 4: Occupational EducationVol. 5: Scholarships, Fellowships, Grants, and LoansVol. 6: Distance Learning Programs"
2,Poorly Done.,"This collection of 12 books is conceptually wonderful. Each of these three inch by three inch board books covers an important aspect of the Bible. There's one book for baby Jesus, another for Jesus' adult life, a book for various Bible heros, one devoted to the creation, one for The Lord's Prayer, and books for Daniel, David, Esther, Jonah, Joseph, Moses, and Noah.What I Like: The concept. The small size is also nice for infants and toddlers.What I Dislike: The illustrations are unimaginative, for the most part. Some are colorful, others are pretty bland. The text is clunky, dry, and often very wordy for young children.Overall Rating: Poor.Age Appeal: According to the publisher, 3 - 6.KristinaEditor at ""Christian Children's Book Review"""
4,Sick and twisted - the way car wrecks are,I found the narration on this to be the best part. Very creepy. It is too bad most 16 year olds are too busy drinking and driving to stop and take the time to be horrified by this.
3,more like 2 1/2 stars...,"wanted to watch this film a lot, but very disillusioned last night after doing so. the safety films themselves are gory and super interesting to watch, especially when you consider teenagers were subjected to viewing such bloody carnage, in the classroom no less....but like another reviewer mentioned, the clips seem scattered all over the place, somewhat randomly. the interviews done with the relevant (older) characters are slow, often tedious, with unnecessary, very uninteresting info (i think a 1/3 of the film deals with where the characters came from and how they knew each other) that seems to drag on at times. the younger people interviewed were clearly more articulate and informative, but you don't feel it all clicks together in the end.the cool bonus is disc 2 which includes 3 uncut original safety films, and other items. but the movie itself... well, i felt i was watching a classroom education film with the click click click of the projector behind me."
3,The Essene Science of Fasting and the Art of Sobriety,"This is an interesting read if you are studying the Essenes.Describing the Essene way of vegetarian diet, fasting, intake of food with moderation and enemas."
5,Absolutley amazing! :-P,"I loved this book! I have always been interested in the Alamo and TX history. This is one of the better books I've ever read! It explains things from a child's point of view, but not from the ""front line"". It tells about the community and such. READ IT!"
2,great knife easy to hold and use but cut a tomato and its dull again.,"great grip,good balance but edge doesn't stay sharp at all so it already finding its way to the back of the drawer with the other knives.I even sharpen it with a ceramic rod but really do i have to do this constantly when i'm cutting vegetables.i'm disappointed after all the video hype good if i want to stab my fruit."
5,I want the soundtrack!,"I saw it late one night on the sundance channel... It... uhh.. it's.. I liked.. it.... No words can describe it. Cept the words ""funny"", ""extremely"", ""gay"", ""sexy"", ""what the ...?"", and ""BOOBIES!"". Yes. Very much. Like the other people said, 'watch it if you have an open mind' specially in regard to EXTREME HOMOSEXUALITY. Ho yeah. :D"
5,This camera goes everywhere,"The Olympus Stylus Epic is small, lightweight, compact, water-resistant, inexpensive, convenient, and loaded with features. This is the camera to take with you everywhere, on the beach, on the trail, on the bike, whatever. Uses easily available 35mm film, and (oh, yeah) it takes great pictures."
2,Rubbish Island indeed,I was really disappointed with this album. It has none of the angst that seems to underlie Wonderstuff's music. It seemed all very watered down to me. Somewhere between this release and the more recent Suspended By Stars they must found that spark again. Suspended By Stars is a much more like the Wonderstuff we have come to love and know.
3,Read a Movie,"The beginning was brooding and exciting. A guy is locked up in a bunker. The middle is long, and larely predictable, filled with backstory. The end is a long, action sequence.SPOILER UP AHEAD--I have one question, if Filmore Faroe has been ""dead"" for 13 years, wouldn't everything be in Leanna's name? Filmore really wouldn't have any power. Once Leanna escaped, she could have struck back with all of her power and might but didn't. Kinda puzzling."
4,tim willocks lets us down with bloodstained kings,I read green river and I astounded by the special insights and psychological inadaquecies the author was able to convey. His special ability to narrate the subtle emotional traumas in his characters was real and very moving. As much as I was touched by his first book is as let down as i was with bloostained kings. Even though he dove into the deep end of the emotional pool i felt that the story was not held together and that character definition was absent. Willocks has awsome ability and I am sorry that to a certain extent it went unrealized in this book.
5,The father of the modern trading psychology,"Among the load of books read, this one is by far, the most comprehensive and most helpful book available on the trader psychology. I read it twice and I expect to read it on a regular basis. It should have been my first book. This book has been written in 1990, which is 10 years ago. I believe, most recent authors on the psychology of the trading have been inspired by Mark Douglas. Congrats Mr. Douglas. This book will allow me to acheive my trading goals, once for good.Thanks"
5,Trader know thyself,"Having personally suffered financially & emotionally in the stock market from lack of discipline and emotional control, i found this book extremely helpful. It identifies many of the emotional distractions that prevent one from seeing clearly,planning & executing well, & provides guidance for resolving & eliminating these distractions. Found it a bit wordy(perhaps needing some editing), but very helpful. It sure impressed upon me the need for discipline & taking personal responsibility in a very unstructured environment such as the markets.Thank you Mark Douglas."
5,"An excellent, insightful book","As soon as I started reading the book I knew it was for me. The ideas and concepts in the book are well presented, if somewhat repetitive. The author examines the psychology of fear that often hinders traders. The book does not recommend any particular trading system or style but encourages each person to find a trading system that best suits their tolerance for risk and to become an expert at that system and to stick with it. Therein lies the need for discipline. Those who dismiss this book have either not read it or have not taken a very close look at themselves."
1,This book is ONLY targeted at the most careless speculator,"I've been trading for nearly 10 years and was looking for a book thatwould teach me to conquer my hesitation and be disciplined in the faceof so much confusing data and emotion. This book was not it. Ibelieve this book was written for day traders who haphazardlyspeculated themselves to failure -- not for those experienced traderlooking for greater discipline.The first quarter of the book wasgood. The last 3/4 of the book repeats itself OVER AND OVER again.Basically, it keeps talking about positive mental energy and negativeenergy and keeps trying to define EVERY little definition. It was SOpainful to read, I had to skim the rest of the book until I realizedthis book wasn't going to help me.Take my negative review howeveryou want in light of all of the positive reviews here. The book givesno program, no steps to take in order to be a disciplined trader...I believe money is betterinvested in a book on technical analysis."
3,Not bad... not great,"I was hooked when I read the sample but after buying the Kindle version and reaching later chapters it became very difficult to read to completion. I wanted to know how it ended but getting there was very difficult... when I finished I felt like I should have followed my instincts and not bothered... it was just ""okay""."
3,A world out of focus,I find this book hard to evaluate because its two main focuses are out of proportion. Niven creates a fascinating future history where one mistake leads to another and eventually dooms the human race to barbarism -- then he pushes it in the background and expects us to get concerned about Corbell bumbling through boring adventures while piecing the history together. (Niven even borrowed the hero's name from another of his stories -- that's how uninterested he was in the character)
5,One hell of a trip..,"For a future Earth to the galactic core and back again, this novel is simply one of the BEST books I have ever read. If you're a Niven fan and haven't read this one yet, you should be flogged! And if you're not a Niven fan and haven't read this yet there is still hope! I've read this book over 5 times over the years and it's STILL one of the best high adventure stories I've ever head the pleasure of reading!5 Stars all the way baby!"
4,Very detailed account of starship pilot's exploits!,"Larry Niven has created a view of the future that encompasses much of our hopes and dreams. But, they are dashed on the rocks and turned into an adventure of huge proportions. This book could easily become a movie, if only someone had the vision. I would love if it were on audio cassette, as well."
1,Save your money,"The quality of the movies is the worst I have ever seen on a DVD. Save your $26.99. The trouble also is you cannot return it for credit. The picture is very dark and is very ""jerky"". Also very, very poor images."
2,dissapointing,I bought it after reading the positive reviews but was very dissapointed. There is no depth at all to any subject; usually just a sentence or two at most. More sophomoric wit than knowledge. I did not even find it to be an interesting powder room read!
3,decreased price,"I ordered this watch on 12/20/10 for $60.71. On 12/22/10, I got an e-mail advertasing same watch for $54.28.

5,Perfect for USB External Disks,"I use this product to connect one external USB disk to two computers. It works perfectly for this purpose. I don't use the software, but rather just the physical push button on the device.Of course, you'll have to remember not to switch it while the disk is active, and properly unmount/eject the disk in each OS before switching."
1,A mystery,"Installed software on two computers and set up all cables. Prints from one computer-- not other. No indication either in manual or on device how to switch. Software screen shots in booklet bear no relationship with installed software. And, of course, sit on hold for tech support. Gave up. Sent back."
1,A waste of good plastic,"I got the switch to work with a Windows 7 computer but not on an XP computer - the USB device was not recognized. After two reinstalls, it still did not work. I downloaded the drivers from the IoGear website and it still did not work. Manual switching didnt work either. I called technical support and was put on hold with elevator music and was constantly informed that they were in business to support me. I was on hold for about half an hour. I then received a recorded message saying that technical support was not available but I could leave a message. I made an inquiry on their 24/7 online support but it was not online at 9 am in the morning. It took 10 hours for tech support to reply back to me via email with a question about the model number. But the model number was included in the original inquiry. I did not feel like wasting anymore time with an unresponsive tech support so back it went."
3,I'll be honest...sorry....,"What KMFDM has become essntially, is a metal band... the electronics and the programming have become mor and more scarce... Now we have Acoustic Drums on almost all the songs, Lucia (which,whom i like but there;s a little bit of overkill with her..) takes over a lot of the album, The song Hau Ruck is amazing and there's alot of old style KMFDM here but they don't quite make it.. It's sad when you look to industrial music and have to see Mighty forces like KMFDM, Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson (Who really isn't that great anyway) just not having it anymore.. I suggest bringing back Esch and Shultz and Kmfdm will be back.. So i guess all we have now is Skinny Puppy (Amazing), Slick Idiot (which not alot of people even know who they are...), Foetus, Ministry, and a few others that still keep the genre alive.. at least some bands don't want to hear MSI for the rest of their lives.. As for Hau Ruck, better that WWIII but not the best..."

4,Well built...as advertised,"I'm very satisfied with this purchase. I created a ""charging station"" in my garage for all rechargable batteries (mower, trimmer, drill, screwdriver, etc.) It's everything as advertised...high quality"
5,great story,"This was a great story. There is action, adventure, sorrow, and happiness in this book. This is the first book that was written by Samantha Harte and it is a wonderful book. It is a hard back book which has helped it to weather the years well. This is a good read!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Little Critter Has a Secret,"Little Critter has a secret. What is it? Well, that's a secret! You'll have to read the book to find out.But what I can tell you is that this is another wonderful book in the series. Little Critter learns that it can be fun to have a secret, but it can also be hard to keep it. He has a moment of surprising understanding from his little sister when he makes a mistake. And he experiences happiness when it comes to reveal that secret.This book is as fun as the other Little Critter books. It has a good story, full-page illustrations and fun gags throughout to catch visual interest. Little Critter's (the Mayers') honest story-telling style is no secret --- it's a winner!"
5,".....simple put, one great band.",this is great. i love it. and you should too. buy it. the best thing of all is you cant tell if they're singin in japanese or english. great music. its fast. very fast. but buy some spazz first because they're just damn nifty.
1,Whats the big deal?,"New listeners who listen to Entombed call this a return to form. Long time fans like myself see this as another line of junk albums from a once great band. Clandestine and Left Hand Path, both godly albums, are slowly being suffocated by releases like this and Wolverine Blues, among other garbage Entombed has released for the past 15 years.Stuff like this leaves me with no faith for the much hyped Serpent Saints. Oh well, Im going to go listen to Dismember's latest album, The God that Never Was."
2,Trying too hard...,"That is what I think of this album. It sounds like a really bad slayer rip off. And it doesn't seem like it bears any likeness to thier original swede-metal sound that is still existant on Uprising. Alot of people will enjoy the polished sound of the production here but really it doesn't suit this album because the songs are so redundant and generic by this band's standards. Because the sound is so clean here it makes the music not seem so heavy. Morning Star does offer a more 'metal' sound of material here than their other most recent albums (Same Difference, Uprising.) Still, this is the worst Entombed album I've heard. I suggest you buy THE HAUNTED 'ONE KILL WONDER' or even one of the new SLAYER albums ... instead of this uninspired [garbage]."
4,best of emtombed,"This album has a unique death metal energy.It is the best album that Entombed every made.It is very jokery satanic. Photos in the booklet show the band standing around a car with 666 painted on the doors- very funny shock value.It is the only death metal album, that I know of, that actually meets the the stereo style of screaming, ""die, die die"" in two of the tracks."
2,not what I thought it was,"Logo on the front is glued not stiched, kind of thought it would be for the price that I payed for it. Sweatshirt smaller than expected, lighter than expected (don't know if that's a bad or good thing), and the stitching is poor (front pocket ripped as soon as I tried it on)."
3,A bit of nostalgia,"It wasn't the most exciting book I have ever read. It is situated in New England about 1814, the time period my ancestors migrated to New York from Scotland. It was a dismal existence in Dogtown and its demise is all too familiar when there is no work or land to till. I guess it was pretty factual as I'm sure the author researched life at the time. I would hope my ancestors lived better even they migrated to Montana by 1885."
2,Lacking,"I eagerly started this book, having loved The Red Tent, but was very disappointed. It was difficult to even finish the book. As I read I found that I didn't even really care about many of the characters, due to the fact that they lacked development. As I finished the book I was simply glad to be done, but felt none of the satisfaction I normally feel upon finishing even a ""good"" novel."
3,This is no RED TENT.,"After reading Anita Diamant's RED TENT, I picked up this book. I was not impressed by the subject matter, nor the characters. The Dogtown history was fascinating, however, the characters were not as developed as those in RED TENT. It was an OK read, but a little disappointing. Not sure I would recommend it to my friends."
3,Not the Red Tent...,I just keep waiting for Anita Diamant to write another book on par with The Red Tent - but this one doesn't hit the mark either. The characters in this novel are colorful and have depth - but some many of them are lost in the shuffle and we do not know what happens to them as the book closes.
2,OH MY...i really wanted like this...,"Try as i might, i could not even finish this book. i really wanted to like it but the charachters were never really fleshed out; I never knew that much aboutany of them...causing me not to care very much.It is a rare day that i do not finish a book and i have read several other's by her. but i just gave up one day,closed it, and did not feel badly about it"
5,Get this cd now! it works!!,"LONG TRAIN RUNNIN"" SOUNDS LIKE THE TORNADO THAT HIT THE TRAILER LAST MONTH. MY GIRL LIKES THE ROMANTIC STUFF THOUGH."
5,Excellent,I knew logisitic regression was the method to analyze my data but had no idea how to go about it. I am happy I found this booklet. In a few hours I was able to acquire the essence of logisitc regression and feel reasonable confident that I was running my analysis correctly. Really impressive how clear the explanations are. The examples are very useful.
2,Nice music but lose the vocals pleeeze,"We'd never heard YLT before and decided to expand our horizons. Amazon does a disservice by only allowing viewers to sample the brief beginning chords of a few songs. Rave reviews led us to believe that perhaps this was pleasant to listen to. It is a major disappointment for us. The instrumental sections are quite nice, but the vocals distract from the experience. If we could, we'd return this CD."
3,Always almost great,"3 1/2Tengo has brought a pretty consistent, if compositionally mellow buffet of songs for many of their later works, always eluding greatness by just enough to garner an array of eclectic boy/girl alterna-pop minor innovations instead, and this of course is no exception, but maybe moreso the rule."
1,i can't make myself like this,"this album was recommended to me because of a number of other puchases i have made, but it [stinks]. every once in a while i will pull it out and listen to it, hoping i was just in a bad mood last time i listened to it. but each time it answers the same, telling me it [stinks]. i try again, hoping to rationalize the wasted purchase, but i can't even salvage one decent track. what a waste."
3,Good Indie,"A quiet, melancholic and gripping record, ""And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside Out"" is a solid and convincing effort from one of the most compelling bands of the current alternative rock scenario. While not a masterpiece or a mind-blowing experience, this little album offers an intriguing collection of hypnotic songs worth listening. Moments like the haunting opener ""Everyday"" or the sublime ""You Can Have It All"" show this band`s strenght, providing tender and delicate compositions. Appropriate to listen to at a calm night, this is a record worth checking.Recommended."
2,Nice hr monitor when it works,"Nice hr monitor when it works. The batteries always burn out fast! Sometimes in less than a month, so I don't use it anymore."
5,Saves my back!!!!!,convenient to store and readily put to use in moving heavier than you'd like objects. really handy to tie objects securely while moving them from your car to the house or garage.
5,Excellent Hand Truck / Dolly,"I used mine for dog shows to carry crates, x-pens, cabana... It's well constructed, light weight and built to last. I'd recommend buying extra bungee cords to use with it, they'll be easier to use than the cords that come with it."
4,A look at the past of the hardships of life in the Scandinavian countries,"With my Finnish ancestory, I found ""Niklolai's Fortune"" quite an eye opener into the difficult times that my ancestors had to live in. Even though it was difficult to read some of the hardships that the women had to encounter, it was somewhat inspiring to see how perservering they were. Many times men felt so defeated with not being able find work and bring food to the table, that they handled their depression with alcohol. It was educational to read some of the historical facts of war that took place and how the citizens dealt with it. I think that the writer could have left out a few unwanted pregnancys. Other than that it was a book I would recommend to anyone."
5,A wonderful book,"This is one of the best books I've ever read and I'm surprised it didn't get more attention. It reminds me a lot of both ""Kristin Lavransdatter"" by Sigrid Undset and ""An Independent People"" by Haldor Laxness. Both were outstanding, award-winning books in their time. Another of my favorites that comes to mind is ""The Greenlanders"" by Jane Smiley. That puts Solveig Torvik in outstanding company. I think of all of these as Norse sagas. That's probably not technically correct, but you get the idea.These and ""Nicholai's Fortune"" are all historical novels which depict the struggle to survive in very harsh social, economic and climatic conditions. This is a book I will definitely read again."
3,Interesting but creepy,"This is an odd movie based on the theory of chaos. There are a couple of interesting characters and plot twists, but the love story between a Spanish student and his aunt comes across as a little creepy and the two actors have no chemistry whatsoever. Most of the movie takes place in depressing London locales also. If you are looking for something interesting and different, you might like this movie. If you are looking for an uplifting romantic comedy, look elsewhere."
1,NOT Vista Compatible But can work.,There are NO drivers for Vista (as of 8/24/07). Vista will list the device in the device manager but the Sandisk Cruzer Freedom is useless.

3,Advice for Life,"""It's Easier to Succeed Than to Fail"" is an interesting book about the findings and philosophies of the founder of Chick-fil-A. I was expecting a ""rags-to-riches"" story from the outset. Mr. Cathy delivered on that point however, I was a bit taken by the schere number of religious references in this book. Mind you, this is not a bad thing, just something I just wasn't expecting in a business book. In my opinion, the book turned out to be much more religous motivational in content than business motivational, with numerous and repeated references to the scriptures, prayer, and dedication of the business to the Lord.From a literary point of view, Mr. Cathy meanders back and forth through the years not in chronological order, but rather in short bursts, tying to the chapters overall theme. The book is very readible however I found it quite repeative, with entire paragraphs, sentences, and themes reoccurring throughout."
2,Good renditions but listless performance,"The versions of the tracks included here are outstanding - excellent production, studio quality, awesome to listen to. That being said, though, the staged ""concert"" itself is contrived and embarrassing to watch; Wetton et al appear listless and unengaged and there is little energy exchange between the performers and the audience as one would normally expect of a ""live"" performance. And poor John Wetton, bleary-eyed and enormous and awkwardly self-conscious... If you do purchase this DVD, hook it up to a good stereo and just listen to the music."
4,ok but not great,This cd is no where near as good as old underoath. I really hope if they come out with another cd that they will have more metal sounding hardcore. Becides this cd they are so hard and people love them. If youre a hardcore kid and all you have heard from underoath is this cd. check out their other ones. they are really hard to find. but if you come across one buy it.
2,"I guess I don't ""get"" Christian metal","First off, if I was to give the actual music a rating, I would give it 5 stars, but its the vocals that bring it down. The singer screams the same scream through the ENTIRE cd. I mean he doesn't even scream different screams, its the same scream. There are 2 songs, ""When the Sun Sleeps"" and ""The Changing of Times"" where there is some actual singing blended with the yelling and those 2 songs are great but there rest are just the same yell. It seems like that's what all Christian metal vocalists sound like. From what I've heard this cd is more mellow than there other ones, so maybe I'll like there next one more. If someone knows of a Christian band that has music similar to this with a vocals that isn't the same scream, please let me know ..."
5,underoath is the best,i think this is a very awwsome cd.along with their newer things.everything from underoath is great!so you should most definately get itand get their other ones tooits so worth itdallas is amazingand so is spencer
5,"yea, they rock","i used to hate this kind of music, but my friend dragged me to their show and i was blown away by these guys. their style of melodic hardcore really got my attention and i was instantly hooked. the cd rocks (especially ""when the sun sleeps"", and ""didn't mean to break your heart""), but if you ever have the chance to see them live, DO IT. they're amazing"
3,Greatly affected me as a young man. Immature when read now.,"This was the one book that captured me as a teenager. I must have read it 5 times. It caused me to love sailing and adventure both real and in the form of travel writing.I re-read it as an adult a few years ago and was struck by how immature the book, and Robin, was. But, it is a book of growth. Read his sequel ""Home is the Sailor"" to continue his journey into manhood and his spiritual quest."
5,Fueled my wanderlust,"I too have read and re-read this book and agree with Robin's view of American life. For those above who wonder what happened to Robin and his family, read the sequel: HOME IS THE SAILOR. It is not widely published but with some searching you will find it--well worth the read. It continues Robin and Patti's way of life, but on land, in Montana. P.S. It's good to hear from those of like mind! Drop me a line and let me know how you liked the SEQUEL!"
2,Boring,My son was bored to death by this book. He had to read it for his summer reading requirements at school.
2,A boy who sailed around the world alone on Dove,I'm in 7th grade and i read this book for my ID (Geodraphy & L. Arts) class. It is a very fun class and my teachers are very nice. This book is about a boy that is 16 yrs old and he sails around the world in a sloop named Dove. I only recommend this book if you like sailing and storms. These are the reasons why I don't like this book that much. My teachers love it. Each table has a chapter to do a project and our group did chapter 7. I liked the culture of South Africa. It is cool
3,Lone Sailor,"Get ready for an adventure, because in DOVE, Robin Lee GrahamWill take you into the life of a young man who in his little boatThat he will use to sail around the world.This goy was outgoing, and set out to look foradventure and love. Little did he know, this boy from San Pedro,California, was about to make history. He will have to make manySacrifices, which for a while was bad.Many people doubted him, but Robin was serious aboutthis trip. He also had many people supporting him. This loneSailor will face many obstacles at sea.Follow Robin to places like Tahiti, Ala Wia, Hawaii,Tutila, Apia, Tonga Islands, Florida Islands, South Africa ect.So grab your gear, because in this trip, you will discoverThe good, the bad and the better of sailing.So come on, you can experience the unforgettable trueLife story of Robin Lee Graham only when you read DOVE."
3,Atmospheric jazz age gangster film,"Very interesting film. Very typical of Warner Bros in the mid fifties. Speakeasies and flappers, colorfully splayed over the then new wide, wide screen. And Peggy Lee and Ella Fitzgerald singing in their prime. Well directed by Jack Webb, but the film is hurt immeasurably by having him in the lead role. He is wooden, and awkward with every line. It is Joe Friday from DRAGNET, transported by some lunatic time machine into the roaring twenties. At 1955 Warner Bros, Paul Newman was making his debut in the wretched THE SILVER CHALICE. Consider, how much more effective this would be if he was the lead, here, rather wearing a toga. Webb believed in the film, and did a great job with its production, but his vanity assured him that he was a romantic lead. He was wrong. I had the laser disc of this and always admired it, with that, rather large, reservation. This dvd is an improvement , visually and aurally, and a welcome part of my collection... at a great price."
3,LOVE THE MOVIE.... BUT,"I CONCUR WITH ALL THE GOOD THINGS SAID ABOUT THIS MOVIE.GREAT MUSIC, GOOD STORY, FINE CAST AND A GOOD LOOKING FILM.HOWEVER,PLEASE NOTE THIS DVD RELEASE SCHEDULED FOR JULY 22 IS FULL SCREEN ACCORDING TO THE PRODUCT DETAILS PROVIDED BY AMAZON.I WAS ABOUT TO ORDER IT UNTIL I NOTICED THAT LITTLE FACT.I HAVE THE WIDESCREEN LASER DISC IN STEREO SO WHY BUY IT AGAIN? WHEN THEY RELEASE IT IN WIDE SCREEN I'LL GET IT FOR THE UPDATED 5.1 SOUND. IN THIS DAY AND AGE WHY RELEASE A WIDE SCREEN PICTURE IN THE OLD FULL SCREEN FORMAT? MAKES NO SENSE. HEY WARNER BROS. EVER HEAR OF HD? THOSE TV SCREENS ARE A CHANGIN.BOTTOM LINE IF YOU'VE NEVER SEEN THE MOVIE OR JUST WANT A COPY YOU PROBABLY WILL STILL BUY, BUT WHY WARNER RELEASED IT THIS WAY IS A MYSTERY. IT COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH BETTER AND RECEIVED AN UNQUALIFIED RECOMMENDATION."
4,A good 1925 Jazz story,"Although not extraordinary, it is a pleasant simple story of a group of Jazz players trying to surviveduring the ""gangsters"" period. The music is definitely good and the presence of Ella adds luster to it.We discover a new actress and singer (Peggy Lee), we see both Jack Webb and Lee Marvin at their""quasi"" debut....all in all, a good film noir well dressed with the music I adore."
3,Buy it just for the music....,"Peggy Lee acts quite well, signs marvellously. Lee Marvin looking quite young acts well as one of the band members (although being a muso, I was a bit worried about how they held their instruments!). Ella sings and acts well in her small roles as the owner of the 'jazz joint'. However Jack Webb appeared to be made of cardboard in most of the scenes. Maybe he shouldn't have tried to act AND direct."
1,No stars at all for this early effort by Mary Balogh,"Plot: UntenableWriting: Very awkward, particularly the dialoguePremise: Ridiculous!Characters: Male protagonist is despicable and demonstrates no character development whatsoever; female protagonist is pitiableBest use of the printed edition: Kindling for a warm fire by which to read some of Mary Balogh's later, better written works.Fortunately for her readers, Mary Balogh outlived this early embarrassing effort at crafting a romance novel. Her later efforts have included some very finely nuanced historical novels, including ""Irresistible"" ""More than a Mistress"", ""Simply Love"" and the Huxtable series."
4,"Bravo, Berlioz!","This is a cute little story. Berlioz is late for a concert and having trouble with his double bass to boot (a strange and unwanted buzzing noise accompanies his playing). The bandwagon gets stuck in a pot hole and the draft donkey just won't budge. A series of animals in increasing order of size and strength--from a rooster to an ox--think they are the solution, but all fail to move the donkey. In a surprising twist we discover the source of Berlioz' bass's buzzing and the donkey suddenly finds motivation. As a result, they make it on time and we learn that the ability to effect change does not always depend on size and strength. Very nicely illustrated. Each lavish page is framed with marginal drawings which show you the country folk gathering at the village in preparation for Berlioz' concert. This is a nice touch and heightens the drama. There's something almost Aesopian about this delightful book. Highly recommended; a great bed-time story."
3,Undeniably flawed but thought-provoking,"The Bottom Line:The Believer has a whole bunch of things wrong with it (sketchily-drawn secondary characters, a bizarre scene where Summer Phoenix licks vomit off the main character's chin, sometimes too-persuasive attacks on minorities, etc.) but at the same time it delves deeply into the nature of Judaism, features a compelling performance by Ryan Gosling in the lead, and raises questions that linger in the brain; it's an imperfect film but one worth seeing.2.5/4"
2,"avoid, it isn't the answer","I so wanted this to work. It came with a rip in the side. Once the genie is let out of the bag, forget getting it back in. Don't think like I did.... oh I will just video how it came out, then I will get it back in. Nope. It happens so friggin' fast. See how nice and taut it is in the pictures. Yours won't be like that.Resist getting this product. I wish I could return it, but guess what? I can't get it back in the bag to even do that. I just count this as a lesson learned for thinking that my experience would be different than others who wrote reviews."
1,Caveat Emptor,"I'd really like to review this item, but that isn't possible. While I ordered the item pictured, I received an unsatisfactory substitute. I ordered this particular item as a gift because of it's unique style. What I was sent, isn't nearly as nice, and I would be ashamed to give it to anyone."
1,Big Package of Bandaids,Very small bag jam packed with all sizes of Bandaids. I should have read the description more carefully. Product does look like the picture.
3,How many pieces?,"So, does the product contain 299 pieces as indicated in the header or 131 pieces as indicated in the product description? Misleading presentation makes one suspicious of product."
3,Many Unanswered Questions,"I read the book cover to cover while using it as a companion tutor to an on line dslr course. I found many of the steps not complete. I had basic questions on basic elements of PSE 3.0 and didn't find any mention of them in the book or index. I was left ""wanting"" for my answers on the basic of uses in Organizer and Editor."
2,Buy it...if you absolutely love violence!,"This was recommended by Amazon, so I purchased it.Over the top sex and violence. In short....would make an excellent cable movie."
3,Sub Par Effort By Franklin,"Having recently discovered Tom Franklin beginning with his latest effort, CROOKED LETTER, CROOKED LETTER, I was eager to read all his works. SMONK was a grand disappoinment. It's a crude, base, and vulgar book. Because Franklin can write and knows how to keep the plot moving I did finish the book. I now consider that time spent similar to being compelled to look at a gruesome traffic accident. It appeals to one's pruient inclinations but doesn't satisfy. Skip this one."
1,Not as described,"I tried this on Dr. Brown, Playtex & Avent. It doesn't fit it any of these 3 brands. Not recommended."
3,Ok not great,"I couldn't find anything else out there for the small non-profit. You'll find that 80% of what's in this book will be in a good book on Roberts, like the Webster's New World Roberts. If you're new to this, you'll probably need the other 20%. It does have some helpful tips. Just don't expect this to be the seminal work on the subject."
4,Bylaws help,"Extremely handy and useful when attempting to edit, amend and even re-writebylaws.Recommend highly.A great find and recommended to anyone who find themselves in the ""revision mode."
2,Sexy priest?,"I picked this up from my local library. I don't think i'll ever read his work again ... because:. it's clumsy, not well written.. The plot is (or tries to be complicated) too predictable.. same old boring stereo-typing, for example, Captain Huong, an Asian, female captain of the Chicago PD in a highly revered special unit, couldn't be bother to speak properly: ""you had fight with girl?"" ... this is from a Captain?. Greely is good at the church, history stuff and he should stick to that, instead of venturing into writing or trying to write about romance, hot-steammy sex acts ... the romantic sub-plot is too simple, quite laughable. something that one could expect from a 3rd-grade writer. I'm wondering if he wrote from experience or failed to do his research. ... Father, please stick to what you are good at, and please have some respect for your audience's intelligence."
4,"Clumsily Written, Unbelievably Complicated Plot, But Great Fun to Read","I'd never read an Andrew Greeley mystery before and possibly won't ever again. My wife brought this one home from the library and it was hearing her laugh out loud that made me decide to read it after she'd finished.The interesting thing about this book -- and presumably about Greeley's mysteries, although I have nothing else to base this on -- is that he's not a very polished writer, his plotting is preposterous, his psychological motivations are clunky, and his page-turning techniques are pretty clichéd ... yet he's funny and charming, and that makes all the difference.This is not a mystery for someone who needs a water-tight plot or graceful prose. Still, I'm glad I read it.Scott Morrison"
5,Another Blackie Ryan Gem,"This book was in my mailbox very quickly! I appreciated the care with which it was packaged, as well as the speedy arrival!"
1,IT PAYS TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE LABEL ......,"""What a TERRIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT - this has an awful SICKLY SWEET TASTE - THE WORST WHEY I'VE EVER HAD - WHY? WHY? WHY? I HATE IT - DON'T YOU SELL AN UNSWEETENED VARIETY? I'M SO DISAPPOINTED I CAN'T STAND IT - THE ONLY THING I'VE EVER BOUGHT ON AMAZON THAT HAS DRIVEN ME TO LEAVE SUCH A FEEDBACK -"" I can't even give it a rating. I'm giving it away to a neighbour who has no taste buds."
2,Not What I Expected,"As a big Perry Mason fan, I have been looking for a bio of Raymond Burr for a while. This, unfortunately, is the only one that has, to date, been written. While it does a fairly good job of detailing the many areas in which Burr worked (from the theater to radio to orchid farming...yes, orchid farming), it does little to tell us about the actual man. The ending falls flat. Little is given on how Burr dies, just one brief paragraph that he does as the book closes. Burr's main piece of work, the ""Perry Mason"" series, is given little play. No insight whatsoever into why the series came about, how it developed, etc. This book, while semi-interesting reading, leaves me wanting more. Will someone please write a bio on Mr. Burr???"
1,Avoid this book and any course that uses this book,"1. This 2nd edition has tons of typos and poorly-stated questions and ambiguous diagrams 2. It does a LOT of handwaving. This is frustrating beyond description. 3. It DOES NOT EVEN say what fields are in a TCP header! Yet it asks a question on it! 4. We used this for a course and EVERY WEEK, the instructors and TAs had to interpret, re-word or explain text and problems from the book that were part of weekly homework. 5. I dont see how that reviewer from San Jose can give this 5 stars. I can only guess that s/he got this book confused with the other Walrand books. To add insult to injury, this awful book has an exhorbitant price (it is but 3/4"" thick). There is much more i could say!TRUST ME: Do NOT buy this textbook and if a prof is using it for a course, DROP the course and/or BEG the professor to use ANY OTHER book (like Tanenbaum or Peterson&Davie). Avoid this book at all costs!"
5,Red Bull Rocks,wow.. now I dont need to take a red bull before I go to the store to have the energy to lug it home.Amazon will ship it for free.I looks like they lowered the price on it !
3,A very good phone,"I run a small hotel. As a result I am not in the office very much and am always out doing something else. The phone system installed in the hotel allows me to transfer all incoming and internal calls to a particular phone extension. As a result I get lots of calls and this phone gets lots of use. I have had many kinds of 900mghz phones in the past and for the money this one has been the best. I bought two of them at the same time so that when the battery runs out of one I start using the other. The battery lasts usually about 4 days. It has been dropped, abused and used quite a lot. The only problem I have had is breaking the belt clip. I would like to get two more belt clips but am unsure where to find them. I have been very satisfied with the phones."
2,Worthless! Do not buy.,This is the most worthless phone I've owned by ATT. Not as clear as I had hoped. There is an annoying beep. So please listen to other peoples warnings about this phone. What clarity? I had better clarity in my old 25 channel cordless.
1,Soul on fire,I purchased this DVD under Walter Trout one song was with Walter the rest our other singer. Walter would be pissed I know that we our disappointed.
2,I have never seen so many ugly salt shakers in my life.,"I guess the book is ok if you like ugly salt shakers. It sure wasn't worth the $20 to me that I paid for it. 90% of them, I wouldn't take for free."
4,"Excellent camera, small price",I gave this camera to my husband for Christmas. He really likes it. It's simple to operate and takes very nice pictures. He's not very technologically inclined so this is a good camera for him. Film cameras are getting hard to find so I hope this one remains available for some time to come.
1,1968 recording!,"This is a 1968 recording, with sound quality to match... Although it's a nice compilation, it doesn't sound as good as it should, and for that reason is a real disappointment."
1,not up to my expectations...,"At the beginning I thought the book was pretty good. Being staged during the Salem witch trial time era seemed like a really good idea. But then the book just went to fast. And Justin's actions torward Belinda, his so-called ""love"" weren't logical. There wasn't much character development in this book and their relationship went in order of: they met and then ""snap"" they were in love. All in all I was extremely disappointed. Personally, I prefer Jill Gregory's newer books."
4,Very Enjoyable,I kept this book with me for quite a while. I loved the depth of the characters. This was a very enjoyable historical novel!
4,original and entertaining,"An original and entertaining view of one of the most intriguing powers behind the throne in English history - Hugh Despenser - and his wife, of royal blood and determined attitude. Recommended as a well researched and satisfying read.The Traitor's Wife"
5,I loved every word on every page.,"MsHigginbotham has written a book that is a real page turner. I was sorry to see it come to an end.I don't want to spoil it for other readers. Writing a ""book review"" is not the thing to do with this book.My suggestion is to buy it today!"
2,Well researched book that really bored me,In part I think the poor editing did not help to have a good read. Igot confused many times as the author switched tenses from past to present. I don't enjoy having to reread to find out if I am in past or present when I should be in one place at a time
3,Not quite what I expected...,"Okay, so I am only about half way through this book, but I am already wondering if I am going to finish it. So many people have the same names that I am getting confused and there is so much sleeping around that I am kind of burnt out on it. AND it would have been nice to know that there is a ton of gay love scenes...Ugh. You need a strong constitution to get through this one."
1,Horrible!!!!,"The dialogue is horrendous! I feel like I am reading a book written by someone in high school. It's incredibly unbelievable. The characters are undeveloped and altogether unrealitistic, despite being real people. It might not have been too bad if the dialogue was in ay way realistic. How this book was ever published is beyond me.As a side note, the wealth of the Knights Templars did NOT go to the French crown. Minor detail, yes. But it still irritates me."
3,strong & pleasing read,The Traitor's Wife by Susan Higginbotham is a strong and pleasing read. From the moment you start you are captivated by the strength of it's characters. The authors descriptions are so telling that you can imagine even the tiniest detail of every page. This is a book that is not easy to set down and one that is not easy to forget.
3,If I could give 3.5 stars I would,"I'm a lover of historical fiction, so downloading this novel was a no-brainer for me, especially with so many good reveiws out there.While I found this to be a good novel, it wasn't excellent. It was highly readable, and a lovely way to pass the time, but some of the chapters drug on a little more than necessary. The main character was well developed, but not entirely likeable. I know that a likeable main character isn't necessary for a good novel, but it helps, especially if the story drags on like this one tended to.Since I'm not an expert on the times/places this novel was set I'm not going to get into review those details.All in all it was a good novel, but not good enough to read again."
5,Addictive historical fiction,"I thoroughly enjoyed this historical fiction; I couldn't put it down and was completely sucked in by it. I've read many books of this genre and found this one to be exceptional. The historical content was meaty. It was lacking in filthy language and explicit sexual images--which I greatly appreciated. Character development was strong, and the plot line was entertaining. Overall, I would highly recommend it!"
3,An interesting story within a poorly written book.,"While the underlying historical events are very interesting, the execution in telling them wasn't great. The writing feels stilted and unnatural. The dialogue was particularly bad. In fact, the characters were all one-dimensional and unmemorable; not even the story's heroine has any identifiable characteristics other than the fact that she's naive and attractive. The lack of character development coupled with all of the duplicate names made what should be an easy book a very difficult read. As far as historical fiction goes, this is not one of the better ones I've read. It was painstakingly researched, but the actual writing just doesn't deliver."
4,an interesting book about an interesting ideal,"this was a very intriguing book based on, what i have been told, a series of short films directed by the author. i have not watched the films, but if they are as good as this book makes them out to be, i really would like to watch them. i would recommend this book to anyone interested in an interesting concept, such as basing films on the ten commandments, and probably anyone who enjoyed the films would enjoy this book as well."
3,So disappointing!!,"I am an avid Mary Balogh fan and I was extremely disappointed when I read this book. I had been waiting for its release for two months and rushed out to purchase it when it was published.The idea was vintage Balogh, indeed The Secret Pearl which she wrote many years ago had the same premise of a girl thinking she murdered someone, being blackmailed by a close relative, and escaping to London to avoid being thrown in prison or hanged.However, the writing was totally lacking the intimacy that makes her earlier books so astounding and interesting to read. Here, I could care less about the heroine or the hero. They were boring.I gave this book a three because when the heroine actually becomes the hero's Mistress, the book starts to get interesting. We get to know the hero and his love for art. We understand the heroine better. However, by the end of the book both characters became completely silly and not worth thinking about after I turned the last page."
2,Balogh More than a Mistress,"Very, very disappointed by the end. I want more romance, less bitterness. By the end, I just wanted to see the heroine run away. Balogh is one of my favorite authors, but this book is not. The next in the series is better, but still not great. The Simply series was excellent, but my favorites were the books from the Bedwyn series."
5,way better than microsoft,"i've tried a couple of things things before and Logitech proves, yet again, that they are the king of pointing devices. it's so much easier to setup, fits in your hands better, the buttons are better laid out and easier to configure. each button is clearly identified in the configuration window with an arrow; absolutely no guesswork involved. everything is customizable, including the amount of force the device gives back for the feedback. i'd give microsoft a C+ for their device while logitech clearly gets an A+."
5,Love these books,"No more to say...I have loved these Valu-Tales books for 30 years, now I need more sets for the grandchildren!"
3,Very redundant-too many batboys with the same theme,"When I bought this book I had very high expectations because I read another ""batboy book"" that was excellent. This book was interesting but it really had great possibilities if it had gone into more depth instead of what kind of tippers the players were(naming the players). Many batboys gave 2 page summaries - I think that it tried to cover too much ground (no pun intended). This book was very shallow."
3,Not his best,"I disagree with the review below.Flow Chart was a bore.His best work recently is in ""Can You Here, Bird"" and a few books around that time.His last two, including this one, seem lacking (though this new one has a handful of very good ones).But if you dig Ashbery, pick it up anyway and see if you disagree."
4,A CLASSIC IN NEED OF AN UPDATE,"Baker's book is the definitive work in the growing baseball autograph hobby.It's too bad his publisher has not commissioned an update. The book is nearly ten years old and as such it's now about 25 players short and the autograph values are now just wishful thinking. Babe Ruth signatures for $495 -- I'll take a dozen!Regardless of its age spots, if you are considering entering the hazardous world of baseball autograph collecting this book will be your core reference."
2,meh,"its an ok cookbook. dont love it. not as many nice traditional recipes as i would like but i guess its good for startes. if you follow the recipes, the food will be under spiced and i like spices so it wasnt great for me."
2,Pretty but disappointing,"I loved _In the Country of the Young_, and expected a similar tale of magic, ghosts, and love to be found in _The Mermaids Singing_. Instead, this is a book with beautiful writing and almost no plot. It consists mostly of the reminiscences of three generations of women who go around acting nasty to one another, and seeking meaningless sex. I couldn't connect with any of the characters or make myself care about their situations. However, make sure to read the rest of the reviews on this page; a lot of people found _Mermaids_ very moving, and just because it's not my cup of tea doesn't mean it's not yours."
5,"Captivating, Leaves you wanting another book from Carey","This book is truly one of the best Ive read recently. Excellent writing, vivid descriptions, interesting Irish folk legends and the lyrical air of this book combine to form a great first novel from Lisa Carey. The only problem is finishing the book, which gives you the feeling you are leaving behind dear friends!"
4,It A Really Interesting Story,"I never heard of Lisa Carey, and one day i was just wondering around and I found this book and it looked pretty interesting. As soon as I started it, I couldn't put it down. Basically the story is about these tree women and what they go through. I think that it's a really touching story."
3,"Great writing, but mother character was obnoxious!","First, I'd like to say that the writing in this book was fabulous! The way the author played with chronology and point of view was interesting and well done. The language was beautiful. I think I could have really liked this book if it hadn't been for the character, Grace. I found very few redeming qualities in her. She was needlessly hateful to her mother. other than her mother being a maid for a wealthy family, I saw no reason for her to act the way she did. Toward her own daughter, she behaved very strangly. At times she is too honest with her (a conversation about her boyfriend's orgasm was particularly disturbing), and at other times she withheld information that would have been vital to her daughter's survival. The whole thing about Grace seemed implausable and contrived.Overall, I think this book is a nice summer read, but not one I would tell people to rush out and get."
5,Enchanting!!!,"Give me a book set in Ireland and I'm a happy woman. Give me a book set in Ireland that's this beautifully written and I'm ecstatic! This book was recommended to me by a friend of mine who is an American who is married to an Irishman and lives in Ireland. Knowing her high literary standards, I grabbed this one right away. I was not disappointed in the least. My 19-year-old daughter also loved the book, proving this story is meaningful to readers of all ages. I can hardly wait to see what Ms. Carey comes up with for her next release!"
5,"Or, variety is the spice of life","Burros offers good, low-fat meals designed to be on the table in 20 to 30 minutes. Organized traditionally by main-dish ingredient (vegetarian, chicken, etc.) each two-page spread includes a full meal, main and side dish, with ""game plan"" directions and nutritional information. Burros stresses a ""strategic approach"" to cooking to maximize kitchen efficiency and her directions are simple and easy to follow.The dishes are simple and delicious and varied - curried potatoes, tomatoes and peas; yellow fruited rice with fish, Chinese chicken and rotini, turkey apple patties.Perfect for the harried cook, sick of eating the same things all the time."
1,Terrible,"In fiction, there are many places where it is okay to bend the rules of reality, but there are certain places you just cannot. There is nothing wrong with a fictional universe being different from reality, as long as its premises are consistent. In Cube 1, the plot was consistent. In Cube 2, ideas such as parallel universes and time distortion are being played around with. While somewhat interesting, there is no logic to them, it is just an amorphous plot device. And the plot is predictable from the start.Also, the film went wrong by giving too many details, such as a military procurement corporation that is behind it all, where it should have been open enough for each viewer to give their own interpretation.It's illogical and is devoid of intelligence, unlike Cube 1. But it is somewhat entertaining."
2,messes with your head,"I would have given it 4 stars if it had a smart and decent ending. It had a lot of Stephen King like qualities to it. It's suspenseful and enjoyable, but then you start to bond with the characters only to be jerked around in too many directions. The end was a huge let down! I wanted something smart and a relief from all the tension, but all I got ""was a WTF was the point of that"" moment. It didn't make sense and you feel awful for hours afterwards trying to figure out what happened. It was a smart movie and could have been great if it wasn't for the end.In an odd way it messes with your head. For some reason I kind of related it to my own life in that certain aspects of it are one giant cube that I can't escape. If that was the point of the movie, it was a real bummer."
2,Not very well made,"I thought the first cube was a great movie. Very claustrophobic and creepy. This was is far from it. There are no jumps or scares in this movie at all. The cube is hardly dangerous and seems to only have two or three booby traps, all of them very bad CG. Characters die with no explanation, the camera doesn't stop moving at all during some scenes making the viewer very nauscious, and the acting is quite sub par. It's got some interesting ideas and scenes, but really isn't worth anyone's time."
3,Not Really a Sequel,"Despite its title, this film must be taken on its own terms and not compared to the landmark ""Cube."" On those terms, it has excellent special effects (including a knock-your-socks-off soundtrack). But (as many previous reviewers have noted) it is seriously lacking in character development and dialogue; I never came to feel I really knew -- let alone developed any empathy with -- any of the protagonists as they babbled their repetitious lines.In summary, if you liked this movie -- or even if you didn't -- you would probably also enjoy the (entirely different) movie ""Cube."""
1,Save your money,"True, Metallica songs do translate well into the industrial genre, and I'm a huge fan of both metal and industrial, but there is little worse music than BAD industrial, which is what is on this disc. The synthesizers sound weak and cheap. The whole CD makes Metallica seem very corny, and the production values are clearly rock-bottom. ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"" is a great song to industrialize, but the versions you can find on the Spawn soundtrack (by DJ Spooky) and on the Die Krupps Metallica tribute album are both far better than this one. It would have been nice to see KMFDM's incredible ""King Nothing"" remix here. The least-butchered covers are the two version of ""The Thing That Should Not Be,"" so if you *really* want to hear those, go ahead, but don't say you weren't warned.I hope the new, second installment of this idea is better... I plan to pick it up USED. I doubt it will be hard to find."
2,Instructions would be nice,"This kit did not come with any instructions how to use the pieces, apparently they expect only jewelers to order them. Needs to be more DIY friendly!"
1,Total waste of your money,"Believe me, it's a total waste of your money.Poor organization of the contents and too many mistakes for beginners to learn as truth. Example: switched titles for figures of structured data and unstructured data. Wrong result of using functions such as displaying that there are 13 months between 12-March-99 and April-98. Don't be supprised to see that the result of a query shown in book is different from what you get from running Oracle SQL*Plus."
1,A pathetic little book....,Don't waste your money. This book was selected as a text for a class. The examples provided in the book are not complete. The chapters are poorly organized and do not explain a function or feature completely. This is not a Beginner's Guide more like Cliff Notes.
4,The Cramps Where they belong: the Mental Institution,"This video from 1979 is black and white, but the overall quality is cool if you are indeed a true Cramps fan. Watch schizophrenics go into epilectic fits induced by the voodoo rhythms. Watch indviduals with downs-syndrome run to hug Lux when he sings ""Love Me."" Watch patients on sedatives do the twist and try to steal the microphone from Lux."
4,It is what it is... A booby mouse pad.,"I got this as a gift for my brother for Christmas. I thought I could kill 2 birds with one stone, I could make my brother laugh and irritate my sister-in-law in one small swoop. The booby cushion is as bulbous as it looks in the picture and kinda smooshy and I'm sure it will give my brother's wrist plenty of support... Until my Sister-in-law finds a way to get rid of it that is... *snicker*"
3,ADD/ADHD Behavior Change Resource Kit,"Not exactly what I expected. It is well written and a wealth of information, but I was hoping for something that I could use to make games for kids I see to drive home some of the skills they have their deficits in."
4,Practical Guide,"As the wife of a husband with ADHD and mother of a son with ADHD, I have struggled for years like many other reviewers to do what is right for ""my boys"". I find this book to be very practical, but I think the key point that all books on ADHD need to make is that each person with ADHD is an individual with unique talents and gifts, and we need to view these in a positive light. Anyone who has struggled with this needs to read a book called GIFTED by Kirk Martin. It's actually a novel about a young man with ADD who comes to understand that the ""disorder"" parents and teachers had considered negative all his life actually turns out to be a gift. I think you can read a summary at kirkmartinbooks.com, it presents an entirely new way to view the ones you love."
5,Timeless Classic - MUST READ,"My daughter read this book as a ""classic"" in 6th grade. I read it, too, and we both thoroughly enjoyed the book. It is not a story about the inequities of segregation in the South and the difficulty of social change, but it brings those issues to life better than any other book I have read. The characters are very real - both my daughter and I were able to stand in the shoes of the protagonist, even though our lives and times are completely different. I strongly recommend this book for adults and young adults."
3,Doesn't fit!!,"This case does not fit the nookcolor at all!! I gave it to my friend who owns the first nook and she loves it. However, I have to search again for a case to fit my nook."
2,Disappointed,The case I received looks like a different version from the one seen online and it is does not fit the nook color! But what I'm really disappointed with is the service I received from the Box Wave company. When I contacted them about a refund I was interrogated through a series of emails back and forth. I filed a claim with amazon and that's how I was able to get a refund. So be careful when making purchases from this company.
3,This cover suited the Nook fine.,"I was nervous before getting this Nook cover as the reviews were very bad and I had failed to read them before ordering.But whoever said this doesn't fit the Nook is incorrect. Mine went right in with no problem.I love the color of it.The ONLY problem I have with it is the smell. It is just now starting to lose the strong odor it came with and I have been using it over a month.So if you are looking for a nice cover without spending a fortune, this is a very good buy."
5,"The opposite of sin is not virtue, it's grace.","This is a must read for every Christian. Written from a faith-filled heart, this compassionate book brings the spirit of Jesus alive for the reader. The opposite of sin is not virtue; it's grace. The world is not hungering for more religion. It is hungry for grace. Yancey reminds us why the crowds all sought Him, and why we still seek Him. Jesus is grace."
1,"Too political, too conservative, a disappointment","I read this book for a church book study class and was greatly disappointed in its political, rather than spiritual focus. I also take exception to the frequent use of the phrase ""hate the sin; love the sinner"" to describe a supposedly ""Christian"" way of dealing with prejudice against homosexuals and women who seek abortion. Who are we to declare that they are ""sinners""??? I wish I never read this book. The author's constant negative examples of churches and people was a real downer. There is so much beauty and positive energy in the world, especially in churches and people, why constantly tell stories about the negative?"
5,A life-changing book,"Simply put, this one book changed my life by giving me hope and a closer, much deeper relationship with the loving God of my understanding"
3,Rules and discipline guide,"This is an excellent book for the subject, well written, thorough and it covers all views on setting rules within the family. The reason that I gave it three stars is that I don't believe it is a primary subject on raising children and I would not recommend it for new parents. I believe there are other areas that parents need to cover for their babies/toddlers/children before setting rules. As for that area, which will be eventually unavoidable this is the most holistic guide that I have come across. It will help all parents to review their discipline and home rules, especially those in peril with their ""difficult"" children, as well as those with older ones that have missed the crucial first years and messed things up. Parents are to be blamed NOT children and considering that ""What's been done is done"" this is a good guide on how to amend certain things."
3,Good!,"Pure Disco 2 is a good Disco compilation that is great to dance to and I think it would be a great CD to listen to while working out! My favorite songs on this CD are I Will Survive remix, (Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty, Macho Man, We Are Family, Flashdance What a feeling, Everlasting Love, Rock The Boat, Upside Down, Play That Funky Music, The Hustle, and It's Raining Men. But one thing though I don't really think of Flash Dance, What a Feeling as a disco song."
5,Great Buy! Much capability for the money.,"Bought this CD ReWriter after using an identical one on my brother-in-law's computer. It meets all of my expectations. I've already used it to:(1) Make a disaster recovery boot disk for my Compaq laptop -- holds all my important programs and data files.(2) Make backup CDs of my most important software.(3) Backup the hard drive on my Dell Tower.(4) Make a ""formatted"" floppy emulator CD that can be written and read by most Windows 95 programs.(5) Combine some of my favorite music onto a single audio CD.The furnished Adaptec software is excellent.A retired electronic engineer/programmer."
5,"It's NOT Over, is it?","I heard this particular song some years ago, and it stayed with me. The beat is REALLY catchy, and the hook is, well, off da HOOK!! Kurupt, of whom I'm not a real fan of, did this little ditty up real right!! Listen to it, it will have you singing the chorus over and over!!"
3,Excellent wine that needs a better vessel.,"Old ""article"" style publication that would benefit immensly from good remake. I guess the inhabitants of Ivory Towers would get more from it than us, simple mortals.But if Yale wants to sell more of these, they will have to use better paper, better fonts and actually use good Chinese printed fonts, not the ones scratched by a needle on the plates. Chinese poetry deserve better.This is an in-depth introduction to both Chinese Classical poetry and Chinese Classical Literary language (Wen Yan). If you have patience, you will be rewarded.But there are better ways of learning Wen Yan and better ways of enjoying Tang poetry. However, if you are a specialist, there may be gems in this book that you may not find elsewhere. But as an introduction, it comes short.I was so offended by the poor polygraphy of the book...Alex Chaihorsky."
2,WiFI SDIO Review,"This card did not work on my Viewsonic V36 PDA, it will NOT work on this version of Pocket PC 2003."
2,Lydia Pinkham,"This product did not work for me at all. I was taking this product along with other natural herbal vitamins to control my hot flashes. Needless to say, after being on this product for over 2 months, along with others, I had to get back on my hormone replacement pills. Also, if you decide to try this product from American Wholesale, you should be careful. They have the same product (Lydia Pinkham) for various prices. When I inquired about it, I was told the the shipping was cheaper on some. That isn't so. All of them had the same shipping price."
1,BAD ALLERGY,"I need to tell people what just happened to me. I got the product. I used it for two days and ended up at the emergency hospital with a bad allergic reaction. Now I have to take three different medications to get well. The ingredients of the original formula seems to be fine. The doctor's opinion was that it could be the new chemical bonding to make the tablets that caused the reaction. My recommendation to everybody is to start with a lower dose (not what is recommended on the box...) and see how you react to it. It is very powerful stuff. It may be great for some people but that was not my experience! Please be aware that even that is a natural product; still is a med- be careful. CW Tampa, Florida."
3,Good vitamin,"This is a good product as far as vitamins go. I feel more energy and overall better health. However, it is not working for me as far as the hot flashes go. Also, the product took a very long time to ship from the company. Longer than usual ship dates that I have experienced from Amazon."
2,Not for the casual fan,"I'm sorry to diss the brilliance of Previn and Shaham, but this is not melodic enough for a bloke like me. I'm a huge fan of Aaron Copland and I just couldn't appreciate their interpretation of him. But hey--I'm not a classical music afficionado, so take my remarks for what they're worth."
2,"Not ""The Best... 1964 - 69""","Judging by the track listing this album pretty comprehensively fails to live up to its claim. While it contains some worthwhile tracks, the most thorough and satisfying compilation - by a long way - of John Mayall's work from this period is ""London Blues 1964 - 1969"".If you really do want ""the best"" then save up and buy ""London Blues""... a superb record that won't disappoint."
4,Very Funny needs to keep it going,Jackie has a unique talent to tell jokes and to make you laugh no matter how silly or ridiculous they may be. We own his other albums and hope he continues to produce funny stuff!!!
2,Ohohohohohohoh!,"OOOOOHHHHHHH! Jackie the Joke! As funny as Beetlejuice is tall. Stuttering John's CD was funnier. Jack, please, rip someone off, do anything but the tired jokes and the amateur delivery. Better yet, find a new line of work! F him!"
5,Purpose cloaked in Passion!!!!,"Excellent overview of Leadership principles.Must reading for anyone and everyone!!!Some have commented that the book is lacking in application, but I believe Maxwell trusts the reader to launch out with passion and creativity to take the next step in light of the leadership principles... reader launch out, move forward, take the step to Lead!!!"
5,Read it in 2 days!,"This book is a great synopsis of what it takes to be a great leader. I could not put it down, and finished it on a 2 day road trip. It explains the rules (laws) of leadership, and gives great examples of how they have been applied in the past by great leaders. After getting this one, and learning what each rule is about, then get his next book which teaches how to apply them. The book includes a website, where you can sign up for a monthly newsletter on leadership, and find more on how to become a great leader. Leaders can be born, but more often leadership is learned...start your education with this book. Quick, Simple and to the point laws to show you the way."
4,Good Encouragement for the Leader,Maxwell's book is a good read for the person who is a leader (encouragement to keep doing the right things) or the person who is in the process of becoming a leader (learn how to become a leader). Anyone who reads the title will benefit in some way.Among the many excellent points Maxwell mentions include:1. How leaders should think.2. Leaders and followers share common values.3. Leaders must make sacrifices.4. Leaders must have impeccable timing.5. Leaders must get outside of themselves and develop others.6. Leaders must be secure enough to reproduce other leaders.7. Character does matter!8. A leader focuses efforts on a few priorities.These are just a few of the many excellent topics covered in the book. Highly recommended.
3,"Not too bad, but not helpful either","I am new to leadership and I was reading the Chinese edition of this book, which enlists 21 different people who showed good example of great leaderships. Collectively what they have done become ""21 different laws"" in this book.The problem I have with this type of teaching is that - it implies that not all of those laws are needed to be a successful leader (as you can see each person listed in this book is contributing one particular law; so why should I be capable of all laws?) One might be able to abstract out a particular behavior from a great leader, however mimicing that behavior is not making another great leader, not necessary.For example, no doubt, Steve Job may be a great leader in Apple, but 'possibly' he might violate several of other laws... is he still a good leader judging by the rest of laws? (just to demostrate the logic I see, this maynot be the best example)"
2,Leadership Lite - Harriet Tubman?,"The book is very much oversold with all the 5 star reviews. I was very disappointed when I found it short on real application (how to's)and developed examples. If you want a taste, read the beginning of chapter 7, The Law of Respect, next time you are in the book store. You'll leave wondering what it was that made Harriet Tubman so wonderful and having no idea how you could begin to model any of her characteristics. In a word: OVERRATED."
4,A Leader of Leaders,"John Maxwell has established himself as a leader in the field of leadership. This book is typical of his work in that it is well written and concise. Maxwell doesn't waste pages on unnecessary verbiage. He gets right to the point and does so quite clearly.When you think about what you read in this book, anyone who has served in a leadership capacity, or more importantly, who has worked at developing leadership in others, knows these principles, or 21 laws of leadership, already. But Maxwell does a fine job of bringing the thoughts and knowledge together in a fashion that is both comprehensible and applicable.If you're not familiar with Maxwell, this book is a terrific starting point in developing your own personal leadership traits. If you are familiar with Maxwell's methods, but haven't read this book, add it to your collection as you are sure to benefit in your quest at developing leadership in yourself and others."
4,Leadership is important,"Book is very readable and does give the reader insight as to what are good behaviors leaders must have. However, don't expect that just because you know the rules to being able to objectively observe oneself applying those rules. Dr. Maxwell relates many instances from his life to application of the rules he espouses, but how does one objectively observe yourself in the middle of a situation, reach into the rule bag and pick the absolute correct rule application. Then he talks about growing other leaders. That is fine, but being able to assess individuals and how they will react when their tail is caught under the rocking chair requires a facet of the mind that is obscure for me.But don't let the above personal limitations stop you from reading and buying the book, it was enjoyable reading and caused much thought that wasn't percieved previously."
1,disappointment,"This is a beautiful guitar bag. I loved it... until I went to put my bass in it. I have a b.c. rich bronze series warlock bass guitar.. and about an inch or a little more doesn't fit in the case... so if you're looking for an affordable cool looking case for your warlock bass, look past this one."

5,"BUY THIS BOOK - BUY FINEGAN'S SCOTLAND, TOO","Golf in the Kingdom comes to life with real information.My golfing buddy and I are in the planning stages of a trip to either Ireland or Scotland. If you appreciate humorous, passionate writing, then this is the book. You can feel the pace of play and exciting in his words. You can also feel his appreciation for the joy of the trip in his conversations with golf pro's, barkeeps, hotel owners.After reading this joyful book, you'll be hooked on travelling just like he has, same courses, same restaurants and inns.Makes a wonderful gift for golfers who fully appreciate the game of golf. Between this and the Scotland book, I think that I've given away seven copies."
3,A Nice Sampling,"This is a pretty decent compilation of songs featuring Reno's unique banjo style, gleaned from his years of work with the Tennessee Cut-Ups. Some of his best work here. Reno was a major player in the early days of bluegrass, and has been pretty much forgotten. This CD is a good introduction to his work for any fan of solid, traditional bluegrass"
4,Creole Moon,"A musical treat, even if you're not all that familiar with Dr. John. Very interesting.........definitely has that Bourbon St.feel."
2,Silly but charming ballads,"On these early recordings, one can hear echoes of things to come. Bowie was already perfecting his storytelling abilities, and certain pet-themes crop up (such as totalitarianism in We Are Hungry Men).The arrangements are light and pleasing, but don't expect anything mindblowing here. Buy this if you want some old-fashioned fun."
1,Not really about Roosevelt,"This book is poorly written, poorly focused and poorly researchedIt barely gets around to talking about Teddy Roosevelt and when it does, it tries - lamely - to claim he had socialist tendencies.This book isn't about the ""Making of Theodore Roosevelt's America""It is about the socialist movement at the time. It is about the assassin's alleged homosexuality...it's about everything EXCEPT RooseveltA big disappointment"
4,Fast Paced and Fun Flick!,"This movie starring Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock is well titled. Anthony Hopkins' character (Oakes) and Chris Rock's character (Jacob Hayes) are an unlikely pair that has to team up for precision and perfection. Not a knuckle-whitening thriller, this picture has plenty of excitement and action without too much gore. It's enjoyable, has a sprinkling of funny lines, and a serious plot. Go see it and enjoy!"
2,I could have put more...,"...if Mr Joel Schumacher did not let his noise department (you can't use the word 'sound', and ""music"" would be totally inappropriate, not to say insulting!) inflict on us this (C)rap. Rap being as close to music as McDo is to ""La tour d'Argent"", it only debases things which, while pretending to be human, are most despicable (The only exception I know about is what was being performed by Warren Beatty in Bulworth; every other occurence I did encounter, I felt like polluted by the use of that BS)."
1,"Bad company, bad movie","Simply put, this is a disappointing film. From the casting to the implausible and even more impossible plot, the whole thing does not make any sense. Chris Rock although a good comedian does not an action star make. Chris Rock tones down his whole schtick in an attempt to be cool and composed but ends up looking half baked. His natural talents are sadly wasted in this movie. Anthony Hopkins who is an excellent actor is a little too old to be cast in an action role to make it believeable. If you want a young guy, old guy action movie see ""The Rock"". The formula does not work all the time. The entire movie is a waste of talent with a painfully predictable plot that no amount of explosions and car chases will erase. The DVD has a THX soundtrack, but barely makes up for the content. Rent this movie first. If you still want to buy it, wait until after Christmas, it should be under relatively cheap by then."
3,3 1/2 stars.,"hello... hello.... hello..... anybody out there? am i writing this review in a complete vacuum? will my words be seen by anyone? i feel existential and alone at the moment. anyway, here goes: this is the 2nd volume of recordings from the obscure cuca records, which operated in southern wisconsin from roughly 1959 to 1969. this disc covers 1965-69, the garage rock and psychedelic era. not as good as the stuff on volume one, ""elemental,"" a wonderfully fun compilation of surf-style instrumentals, this cd is nevertheless fun for its obscurity and the cheesy sincerity with which these young nothern-midwesterners brought to the studio to perform garage-psych music. no threat to be found here at unseating the beatles or the stones or hendrix as the masters of the sixties sound, but that's okay. fun stuff, and i recommend it for lovers of the obscure."
5,World's Best!,"This coffee is amazing. I stumbled upon it during a recent trip and ever since then, it is the only brand I trust. I use this with my percolator. Highly highly rec this!"
5,OEM Nikon eyecup DK-21,Lost the original DK-21 eyecup off my Nikon D90. Replaced it with this OEM Dk-21 which is identical to the original shipped with my camera. Snapped it in place and started shooting! Genuine Nikon quality!
1,Does not fit the Nikon D40,The quality seemed ok but it would not go on the camera that it had listed so if you have a D40 do not purchase this item as it will not work.
5,Great toy and big hit at Grandson's party!,Great toy for either boy or girl. The train sound is great and realistic. The train does not always make around the track but the sound keeps on playing...just need to pump it a couple of times. It a great toy...everyone was impressed with the sound quality and the product itself.
4,The Best of Andy Gibb,"For those that think that Andy Gibb was just a young man riding on his brothers coattails, you need to really listen to this CD. Andy was still a teen when he wrote and co-wrote these songs and they show a depth that reveals his talent for writing from his heart. The truly great songs are the ones that didn't become singles such as: ""Words and Music"", ""Let It Be Me"", and ""In the End""."
3,Timex watch,I like the styleing of the watch very much. The biggest problem I have is that the hands are silver which is sometimes hard to see aganst the white face.
3,No es lo esencial,"Esta recopliación de canciones de Miguel Mateos podría tener cinco estrellas sino fuera porque las canciones 3 y 4 (Cuando seas grande y Mi sombra en la pared) del CD son versiones en vivo y no las originales. Y no mencionan esto en la portada del disco compacto. Además, para mi gusto, le faltarían estas dos canciones para que fuera ""Lo esencial"": ""Es tan fácil romper un corazón"" y ""Llámame si me necesitas"". ¡Dios los bendiga!."
3,Different and Deep,"This artist has a telling voice. The first time you listen to this CD you go... hmmmmm. The more you listen to it, the more you like it. She sings the words as if she really feels them. The words.. the point to the songs are things we have all felt or feel now. She has a wide vocal range and these songs really show it off. I would buy another of her CD's if she comes out with one."
5,great protein,"I just recently started conditioning again and decided to buy ON 100% Whey. Before that, the last time I tried Protein mix was about 5 years ago and I stopped using it because it would give me gas (I'm lactose intolerant), wasn't easily mixed, didn't taste good, and didn't seem like a healthy addition to my diet. ON 100% Whey has been a great product in every aspect that was lacking in my my previous experience and I plan to use it for a long time."
2,I will be completely honest....,"I had heard so many good things about this camera. So when I finally got one I was excited to get it started! But the truth is it DOESN'T soak up enough light. I don't see how everyone can say this. I have THREE windows behind my computer with a good amount of light pouring in but my camera still can be dark at times. The image is NOT that clear, it appears yellow at most times, and just the overall quality isn't the best. I had a VERY cheap cam before this one and I consider the first one better. For first time users, it isn't that bad to have but if you are looking for something really sharp and clear, I wouldn't get this one."
4,Excellent Learning Tool,"While at Gettysburg I wondered about all the cannons, whose were they, how were they employed, how effective were they? This book answers those questions and guides you through the fields with easy to follow references. There is just enough back-story to put the battle in historical perspective but the artillery is the focus. Well written and researched it is an excellent companion for touring the battlefield."
1,Just another low carb diet,"Nothing new here. If you've read other low carb books, no need to waste your money on this one."
2,Great if going to Boston but......,"If you're going to Salem, this atlas is worthless!!!! I don't understand the other reviews mentioning Salem, very misleading. They must be talking about another atlas because it's almost as if they show Salem as an afterthought. There are two tiny sections of Salem in this atlas. One section cuts Salem in half with no detail & the other is at the edge of the page so you basically, again, see no detail. That's just it, as historic as Salem is, you want detail. I don't understand why there wasn't a page dedicated to just Salem & surrounding towns. I was very disappointed.If you're going to Boston, this atlas is VERY detailed. I'll definitely use it then but don't go by the other reviews if you plan on going to Salem. Get another atlas."
5,Great book -- Great condition,"This book was in excellent condition for a used book. I have just returned from a trip to the Holy Land, and this book addresses traveling in Israel in the most beautiful way possible! I am buying several copies for gifts, and I am grateful to Amazon for helping me find multiple used copies that I can share with my friends who have also visited Israel."
5,"We all wonder, ""How will it feel?""","Nuland won the National Book Award for this frank and sometimes disturbing reflection on death. And while this is challenging material, especially for anyone who has nursed the terminally ill or suffered a grievous loss, How We Die ultimately puts death in its place, robbing it of some of its mystery."
2,This book is way over rated,"This book is terribly disorganized, leaping back and forth, repetitive in many details, laden with anecdotes totally unrelated to the subject. It offers a few first-hand accounts on the fact of death in medical facility, which are detailed and revealing; but then it rambles on with less and less scientific backing, for instance, about why sometimes people feel tranquility in their last moments. There are stories that can fit in one page that stretch into chapters. The book becomes really boring after the first chapter"
3,Radio indeedy,"The radio interference really is quite bad. Granted, I live in downtown Atlanta, and you can probably pick up FM on your fillings, but even without connecting it to a sound source, I could hear radio. After monkeying with various configurations, I discovered that looping the sub's input twice around the speaker (with a single twist) reduced the static to an acceptable level. What worked even better was just crumpling up the input cable and holding it in my fist; but I got hungry and had to let go."
4,Quality Stereo for a reasonable price,"Compared to current surround stereo speakers like the Altec Lansing brands, the quality is quite good.I experimented by playing Half-Life (which has excellent 3D surround sound), and Planetscape Torment. The sound quality for both was excellent. However, the surround sound quality for Half-Life was patchy. This might've been more to do with my room than the speakers.The speakers are marginally less useful for playing CDs on. For some reason, the volume for CD playback is slightly lower than for game sound effects.In summary, if you're looking for surround stereo speakers and can't afford the more expensive Altec Lansing brands, then I definitely reccommend this one. Just remember that surround stereo sounds better in an enclosed room."
1,Harry Bosch Novels (1&2),"The Harry Bosch Novels (both volumes 1 & 2) introduced me to Harry Bosch and Michael Connelly. These are great police procedural stories as well as very well done mysteries. I could do with a little less of Harry's attitude, but it plays well, too. Except that no hierarchy would put up with the extremes of the attitude. The six novels included are very much worth the money and are excellent reading. I am in the process of ordering the rest of the Harry Bosch series from Amazon."
4,"Harry Bosch Novels:The Last Coyote, Trunk Music, Angels Flight.","These three books are well-written, fast paced and highly entertaining. Some of the best police/mystery books I've ever read. I now have the entire Harry Bosch collection and re-read them often."
4,This Is Great Stuff,"I am at the climax of Angel's Flight and am really looking forward to the final pages. I discovered Michael Connelly on a cover whim. Looked interesting, so I will give it a try. Well, almost 6 down and all of his others to go. Harry Bosch is smart, human, weak, strong, & individualistic. Gotta love it."
5,Love Harry Bosch!,"Because I had some time on my hands, I bought and re-read all the Bosch novels. I think Michael Connelly has the character really sewn down. It's so easy to empathize with his personal and professional issues. Everybody has probably suffered from one or two of them in their own lives and can easily identify. I really like the fact that Bosch ages in real time, just like the rest of us. And I love that the ending is ALWAYS a surprise. Happy reading!"
4,Nice job for an old favorite,"I used to go see Bryan Lee back in the day (70's) at the Church Key in Madison WI. I wasn't a blues fan, but this guy made me one. A great stage presence, tight guitar work and genuine soul. Lee loves his work and it shows. Here he combines about half & half original/cover and live/studio work. This CD is an excellent representation of Bryan Lee's music and style. Brings back good memories. Recommended."
4,My personal favorite of '04,"If you are looking for intelligent, non pop/punk infused emo, then this is your band. These guys got it right. Unique song structures, dual vocalists, and intricate guitar work with keyboards! is a great formula. Alot of people will tell you how great Walls is, and while that song is very good (like the rest of the songs on the album) track #5 fractions is perhaps one of the best songs in the genre. Wow, that song gives me goosebumps, which is a good indicator of a great song. If you are reading this you are most likely thinking about getting this, so go ahead, you won't regret it. Also check these guys out live, they are very good."
3,Cut the middle out.,"I like this CD, I really do. So why dont I give it a higher score? Well... to me, a few of the songs in the middle just, didnt do it for me. Don't get me wrong, its still a fine CD. Its just those few songs that I always find myself skipping to get to the end. On a good note, I find myself absolutely loving Walls and Ponytail Parades. I still cant get enough of those songs. So, I would still recommend this album to those who have heard either of the aformentioned songs and liked them. These guys have a very promising future, so I would be looking out for their upcoming CD if I was you."
4,Genial del todo!,"Para los que sepan español!!! La versión de Balsamo y cia. es maravillosa. El Gethesemane de esta edición es absolutamente elegante y grandiosa. Ese agudo mantenido durante 20 segundos no tiene NADA que envidiar a Neeley o a Gillian. Es perfecto. De esta versión NO me gusta el final de Heaven on their minds (mucho mejor el de Anderson) y Magdalena Ampil, parece salida de la Bella y la Bestia (demasiado dulzona), su elección no me parece acertada."
1,cartridge won't work,Cartridge won't work. Printer reported as incorrect cartridge. Cartridge came in bubble wrap -- not original Xerox supply box as indicated by picture. Probably a remanufactured cartridge not original. Do yourself a favor and don't order this item.
2,very dated but,This film only holds up as a relic of a very much ago.I saw this film in the early day of TV. It still puta lump in my throat mainly because of rememberanceof a childhood viewing. Shmaltz yes from a very simple time.
4,Go To Town...way cool,"I purchased this album originally in 1988, and loved it. I lost it for a time and rediscovered the album and the band and can't speak more highly of this album. Fron the first track to the last, it was what a good solid rockabilly album should be. Full of a stong beat, great guitar work and lyrics that seen to speak to the listener and tell a great story. Wether that story is true or just a great rock and roll lie..who cares. The album is a must for fans of the Straycats, Buddy Holly or any one who love pure rock and roll. Roll up your jeans, grease back your hair, grab you best girl and dance like mad, and the hold her real close for the slow songs. Have some fun...Go To Town."
3,"Broad, shallow survey of chess strategy. Intermediate level.","A collection of articles based on Pandolfini's Chess Life columns in the 1980's. Covers wide range of topics from how to play open/closed games, mating patterns, 64 tips to improve, etc. Most useful to brush up on themes you may have forgotten, but doesnt give any real in-depth instruction in any one phase of the game."
2,Sufficient,"This book is sufficient to teach chess to a beginner. But why did the same author write the Ultimate Guide to Chess and keeps on writing more books that are supposed to do the same stuff? Probably retiteling them and slightly changing the format will get more books done and out there to make you more bucks! Smart guy when you run out of things to say.As I said this book is sufficient to introduce you, but look at other books too."
1,No instructions,"There were no instructions accompanying this product, therefore it was very difficult to use. I wrote to the company (via Amazon) asking to be sent instructions, and have not received any to date.I would not purchase this product again."
5,Real Deal,"This is a real Nikon EN-EL3e battery, not the cheap imitation battery you find for less money elsewhere. It takes and holds the charge the way a true Nikon battery should.This was the best price for the real battery I could find anywhere on the Internet."
5,works great,I almost bought a 3rd party battery for twice as much at local electronics retailer... so glad I decided to check with amazon.com first.
2,possibly recall????,"To customer before me, you camera D200 might be on recall. Please check the Nikon website for more info. You have described the exact recall problem. Good luck! BTW, have you tried or someone tried this battery on a D70? I am thinking to consolidate and have all greys batteries rather than black for the D70 and grays from the D200."
4,Good Product.,It's a battery. I like it. It was a gift for the wife to supplement her other battery. Works as expected.
5,Works like a charm in a battery grip,"What's bad to say about a Nikon battery (or almost any product Nikon makes, for that matter)? With two batteries in my battery grip on my D90, I forget I ever have to charge them! I've taken over 5k pictures on just a couple charges and several of those included using the built-in flash as a CLS trigger. You owe it to yourself to spend the bucks and grab a spare, especially if you get a battery grip."
5,Simply....................,the best recorded Damnation...soprano could have been better but the recording soundstage is terrific. A+
2,"Great voice, but...","30 years ago I bought a Jon Lucien album based on what I read about his great voice. I remember liking only one or two songs, thinking maybe it was just a bad album, but yes a great voice and a lot of potential. Then I forgot all about him. So here he is again after all these years...and listenning to his songs here and on other albums, it brings back the same impression I had back then. What a waste of talent! To all of his female fans out there, I apologize. Yes, the voice is amazing, but the songs in my opinion are really bad. I say this only because one song - ""When The Morning Comes"" - is perhaps one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. I thought so 30 yrs ago, and I still think so today. It is stunning. Which is what makes hearing the rest of the songs so disappointing. Who was this guy's agent? Bad song selection is one thing - but over an entire career? Sorry, but I would have taken Jon Lucien down a totally different musical path than the one he took."
3,Not as rigorous as I hoped,"I agree with what other reviewers have said about the book. It's clear, readable, fairly in-depth, etc.My only problem with the book is the proofs it provides. I've found many of them are not that rigorous and make logical leaps that should be fully explained in an intro book. Not necessarily for clarity but as a good example of proofs for learning students.Maybe the author meant to have more 'casual' proofs for readability but I had hoped for more rigorous proofs."
5,The Sort of Book You Want to Talk About,"I'm beyond shocked at the negative reviews because I usually don't hop onto Amazon to write a review, but felt compelled to do so for this book because I enjoyed it so much. I read it at the beach, which was perfect because it's the sort of book where you want to pop your head out of the pages and announce to everyone else sharing the beach blanket what you just read.I loved Ronson's earlier book, Them (and used it in the sociology class I taught), so I had a feeling I would enjoy this book too. And I wasn't disappointed. It's engaging and moves at a great pace. One thing I love, which few journalists-turn-nonfiction-book-writers do, is that Ronson breaks down the 4th wall between the reader and the subject, injecting himself into the narrative.Definitely recommend this book."
2,"Interesting subject, disappointing execution","I unfortunately just did not like this book. I heard great things about it and was excited to delve into it, but I just found the style of writing too hoaky. It is an interesting topic and I wanted to understand the facts and history of it, but the author's forced jokes into every paragraph became a distraction. My personal taste toward journalistic pieces is along the writing style of Mark Bowden (Blackhawk Down and Finders Keepers). I congratulate the success of the book and the subject matter, but it just was not a style of reading I appreciate."
5,"Half funny, half terrifying.","Some of this books is hysterically funny, some of it is plain scary.Quite how much of this is completely factual is open to interpretation. One cannot help hoping at least some of it is exaggeration (and that some of it is just plain fiction... please :-o)... Sadly, some of it at least very definitely is not, including some of the human rights abuses perpetrated by the ""good guys"". It is shocking to see the ways supposedly civilised countries treat those they suspect of being terrorists.This is illuminating reading, and manages to be both very entertaining and often genuinely shocking. A thought provoking read."
4,A detailed account of the Guadalcanal campaign,Recommended. It goes into detail about the campaign between the 1st Marine Division and the Japanese Army and you get a very good feel for the campaign and its high points as well as references to how the strategic events of the Pacific Theater effected its outcome. There are plenty of maps in a simplistic and clear style and also plenty of photographs. Easily among the better Osprey books.Note that this is one of Ospreys old titles and it uses a different setup and includes things like wargaming (not very useful even if you as I do play wargames). On the upside these have been some of the best books Osprey has published.
4,Close,"This is one of the closest HPL adaptions I've seen. Although it is a ""B"" movie, it stays moderately close to the original tale, with the exception of the private dectective/love story twist. Why can't they just leave the story alone, you ask. Well, me too. That aside, the acting and special effects are weak, but the mood is all there. It is definitely worth a viewing if you are a Lovecraft fan. Maybe someday they'll make better adaptions, but for now, this is about as good as it gets."
1,"flat, disappointing","I'm not sure where this one went wrong ... O'Bannon has a decent track record for genre pictures, and everyone else here seems to think this a faithful rendition. Sure, the original story is relatively intact, but what about atmosphere? There is no trace of those obsessional qualities that make Lovecraft's fiction so engaging. The music is lousy, the dialogue dubbing as bad as any chop-socky bomber, and the acting basically faxed in. Instead of Lovecraft's dread & nihilist drive and we get is a lame whodunnit & revenge number. Not sure what a brightly-lit glass brick office has to do with ""eldritch"" either. No fun."
4,The Resurrected,"This is easily one of the best Lovecraft movies ever made. It is hard to translate Lovecraft to the silver screen but it was done here quite well. Based on ""The Case of Charles Dexter Ward"", this faithful adaptation really impressed me. I had seen it when I was much younger, before I even knew who Lovecraft was and I loved it. Years later I had found it and realized what it was based on. All around this is a great movie and worth watching for the catacomb scenes alone. One thing that always bothered me about this movie was the window in the padded cell, but despite this and a few other small issues, this is a great movie for fans of Lovecraft and horror in general, highly recommended."
3,GREAT MOVIE... CRAPPY DVD EDITION... UGH,This DVD so misrepresents a wide screen movie... It's in 4:3 aspect ratio. It also suffers from some cut scenes that should be restored in a Director's Cut... Great movie... Crappy DVD edition... UGH
4,Very Lovecraftian,"As touched upon in other reviews, this is the gold standard on H.P. Lovecraft-themed films. Involving story, terrific performances and wonderful atmosphere. Chris Sarandon, in particular, is a standout. Kudos to Dan O'Bannon's direction as well. Its great to finally have this on DVD, but its too bad its a bare-bones release."
4,Hi-tech toy,"The picture quality isn't comparable to ""regular"" digital cameras, but then again - this isn't a regular camera! The Internet Viewcam is extremely small and very easy to handle (point and shoot). Barely OK for taking simple still images (640 x 480) and OK for making small MPEG-4 movies (max 320 x 240) that you can distribute over the Internet. It's really simple to transfer pictures and movies to/from the camera via the included smartmedia floppy adapter, but the bundled software is crappy. The Internet Viewcam is more of a toy than anything else (because of the poor picture quality), but I would recommend anyone to buy it as it's the coolest hi-tech toy I've seen in years."
3,My Sharp mpeg-4,"This little unit looked so cool I bought it as soon as they were available in the USA. (You can't beat the size, it's about the size of a pack of cigarettes.) I've had it for about 1 1/2 years. It's come in handy on a few occasions. But the output is so low res, I find myself yearning for more dpi. I'm getting better at taking pictures with it, given its limits, and currently have one of its photos as my desktop screensaver. Even at that size (on a 19 in monitor), it looks OK. I just sent my mother 4-5 photos of her grandchildren and they uploaded (winzipped) in about one minute on an analog line. The shutter is a little slow, so there's more time then you may be used to after you click and before you see.... You know what they say, you can't have it all. With this you trade speed for quality and convenience for precision. And it just gives me another excuse to buy another piece of equipment."
1,Edupress SIX TRAITS OF WRITING,This item was much smaller than I expected and offered very little in the way of writing help for teaching fifth graders.
1,Good album ...,"These guys have an earlier album called Junkfuel that is 1000 times better than this budget bin material. Nice example of a Jeckyl and Hyde transformation from one album to the next. Unless you're the Fonze, you're going to realize this album stinks worse than the food at Al's. I am the robot king."
1,Weak Wagner,"I can't tell you how much I really hate this album. Everything but the cover was a mistake (and yes, it DOES have a cool cover!). The selections are so often wrong because there are too many boring numbers and when an exciting piece of music has been selected it's been cut up (even though there is still plenty of room on both CDs for complete pieces).If you haven't heard Wagner before this isn't the one to start with. If you DO like Wagner you will be terribly disappointed."
4,Excellent Introduction to Wagner's Music,"If you have any interest in discovering (or rediscovering) the classical music of Richard Wagner, I would highly recommend you purchase this CD set. The selections are not complete by any means--many of them are excerpts from the full-length operatic or orchestral works, but even this shortened format provides a pretty comprehensive overview to Wagner's music. Also, the price will be hard to beat for a 2-CD set like this one. (By the way, if you think you don't have much familiarity with classical music and are looking for an ""intro"" CD, you will be pleasantly surprised by how many familiar tunes you will find here--tunes that you might never have associated with Wagner, but which you have heard many times.)By the way--does anyone have any idea where I can find a CD with Wagner's ""Elsa's Procession to the Cathedral"" on it, in a full orchestral version? All I can find are recordings done by brass ensembles, and it's not really the same!"
4,Kathlyn Williams,"The chapter on Kathlyn Williams is wrong on many issues: the year of her birth, her early life, and the name of her first husband. She was born in 1879, and her mother was born in Norway and not her father as the author states. She is listed on the 1880 Montana Census as being a year old. She was called Katie when she was little, and she attended Montana University in the late 1890s. Her father, Joseph Williams, was the parent who was of Welsh heritage. Her first husband was named Otto H. Kainer, and they married in October 1903. I have done extensive research on this actress, and I also have a copy of a New York Supreme Court document from 1905 when she sued her first husband.Otherwise, great book!"
5,Works Great With My Mic Stand,"Length:: 0:32 Mins5 Stars! The MA100 works great with my Mic Stand and fits it snugly. If you buy theManfrotto Mounting Adapter, 3/8"" Female Thread to 1/4""x20 Male Thread, 20mm Long. (#3358)it will fit your Zoom recorder. You must have both for it to fit though."
4,Stephen Page Solo,"Well - here i am 5 years later because i didnt pay attention to this release at the time. Now that stephen page has left and i just picked up the latest BNL album without realizing he was gone until it was too late, i found myself searching for Stephen Page because he was who i was basically liking the whole time. SO, HOPEFULLY Page will continue on his own because i believe he can be successful just like Natalie Merchant and Morrissey when they left their bands. good job stephen!"
2,Don't confuse this with Barenaked Ladies music...,"I am such a big fan of the Barenaked Ladies and of Steven Paige, that I hate to give ""Vanity Project"" a bad review. Alas, I would be lying if I said that I liked it. I felt as though all of the songs were very similar. The album lacks the diversity that almost all of the Barenaked Ladies albums have. Almost all of the songs use the same instruments in the same manner; song after song after song. I like ""wilted rose"" but not enough to make up for the rest of the songs. Sorry to disappoint anyone that really likes this album. I think I subconsiously bought it because I wanted to hear Barenaked Ladies music... that was my own mistake. Overall, I have to say that the album is mediocre at best."
2,Bob and David say no!,"If you are contemplateing purchasing this for any reason. Remember: Bob Odenkirk, and David Cross do not endorse this movie. In Fact, on their website they Actually tell you that it is not that good. If you want proof, go to ""WWW.BobandDavid.com"" (Article should be at the very bottom of the main page)"
1,Mr. Show is great but this movie sucks,"This movie is terrible. I love Mr. Show and think Bob Odenkirk, David Cross, and co. are comic geniuses. But this movie is pure garbage. The best parts are lame copies of what was already done on Mr. Show and they've destroyed the pacing, creativity, and cutting edge humor that made Mr Show great."
2,You too Jeff Gold-steen.,"Now I'm usually one what finds anything old Bob and David have to offer as funnier than a clown holdin' a bag of farts, but ""Run Ronnie Run"" is not on par with previous Mr. show offerings. For those of you who are fans of Mr. Show and the original Ronnie skit, you aren't gonna find much new here. Pretty much a rehashing of that same skit, which plays (the skit) hilarious for the ten or so minutes it was on, but not enough material to develop into a feature length film worthy of Bob and David's talents. Granted it is pretty fun to watch with other friends who are familiar with the show, but the laughs get spread pretty thin. I subconsciously hoped that the movie would somehow segway at certain points to another skit, as Mr. Show did so brilliantly over its 4 seasons. The movie's worth a view for you die-hard Mr. Show fans, but can't say I'd add it to my collection. Keep 'em coming Gleep-Glop."
4,A fun Romp with Ronnie,"In a day when it's hard to find a comedy that you can actually laugh aloud, Run Ronnie Run is just that. The characters are off-beat, and David Cross is at his funniest in this silly comedy. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that wants or needs a good laugh."
1,Absolute garbage,Was lucky to burn the few CDs I did. Drive is lucky to recognize any media at all. Stay far away from HP stuff. At one time they stood for quality. Not any more.
5,A wonderful book!,"I enjoyed this book tremendously! McLeay is a master of analogy. If you like beautifully written literature, this book is for you!"
1,Awful Mockumentary,"I saw part of this moronic documentary on cable once, and for years I thought the the White Stripes must be a horrible band. Just this week I heard some of their songs, and now I realize that this documentary was a terrible rip-off of this band, and an awful negative mark against the band. I wonder how many others have seen this on cable and decided that White Stripes must be a waste of time and money?"
2,If this movie was a bucket.. it would be a leaky one.,"A deformed boy some how transforms into an 8 ft. demon. Of course there is a backwoods witch involved, also a revenge plot in which 6 teens in the mid 1950's torture the deformed lad. And yes you've guessed it, it wants revenge. We meet this 8 ft. demon about 30 minutes into the movie when the horror almost begins, but never really does. I never expect the acting in B-horror to be award worthy, but if the actors can't act scared, It's hard for the viewer to be scared. One more complaint is Pumpkinhead seemed to be very limited in movements in this 2nd film. He moved like a kid playing with an action figture of Pumkinhead from the first film. With all this being said just watch the first one, it's better and provides genuine chills that this sequel lacks. A good horror film is one that you might want to watch again in your lifetime. This film gives you your cake, but the problem is eating it too."
2,This is a sequel?,"This is the alleged sequel to Pumpkinhead, the great monster movie directed by FX artist Stan Winston. This is not even a sequel, it's more of a remake kinda like Evil Dead 2 only nowhere near as good. It's plot is different, almost completely different from the first. The special effects are worse, and Pumpkinhead becomes a sympathetic character. Ugh."
2,Not very happy,"The carafe has a plastic insert with a strong smell. There was no instruction how to pull it out (instructions were very general, incomplete and written in not very good English). I did not get any response from the factory, so I did not have a choice and had to return it. Also, for this price the outside of the top should have been plated better."
4,Great Price!,"Not wishing to spend hundreds of dollars on other Alfie products, I chose this one. The vessel is gorgeous and really does keep liquids very hot for a very long time. I've not tried it with cold liquids. I use mine for coffee service, so I removed the tea diffuser. I would recommend this product. The only negative I can find is that it doesn't hold the capacity I was expecting for the size. 8 cups? Also, unless I'm doing something wrong, it's not 100% sealed. Leaks ever so slightly from top when inverted. My original Alfi didn't do that. Still, it's a great product for the price."
1,Does less than 1 mile mean anything?,"I purchased this tube as a spare for rides. After replacing a flat, loading the CO2 cartridge to proper pressure, and setting off, this tube burst within a mile. Needless to say, I'm buying my tubes from local bike shops now."
3,"Will not work with Windows XP, no 'patch' available","This product will not work with Windows XP. I've contacted HP and they referred me to their third party software development company for an update to the software. The third party software company does not respond to my e-mail inquiry when the upgrade will be ready. According to HP representative, HP had expected the upgrade to be available by Christmas, 2001."
5,The Homecoming,This book was really good. I could not put it down once I started reading it. The love scenes are similar to real ones and you will be drooling before you get through with them.. It is very suspenseful and leaves you wondering who the killer is. I gave it a 5 because I have never read anything so good in my life. I hope Kimberly Rangel keeps up the good work.
2,Collection of Government Articles,"One should always read the product description carefully--I didn't.As far as I can see, this is a collection of publically available government documents, most (all?) available on www.fueleconomy.gov.The description clearly says this. It just didn't sink in for me. So if you want a copy of all the articles on one DVD (maybe for searching purposes), then this is for you. Otherwise, the same information is available on the web."
3,Mafia in Havana,This is an extremely well researched book chronicling the USA government and the mafia's penetration into Cuban mainstream businesses. Looks like the writer had unusually deep access to Cuban business and government archives.Not a fun read but very informative.
3,not as challenging as her other workouts,"I am sad to say I'm a little disappointed with Ellen's Studio workouts :( I swear by her Crunch DVDs - love love LOVE them! I've been doing them for several years now and I love love LOVE my results. The Studio Slim Sculpt is very low impact and a very light workout.I'd absolutely recommend this for an ""off"" day. Besides the light workout, Ellen always has an upbeat attitude and makes you really want to do your best.I guess I'm just bias to her Crunch days."
1,Not a great item,These are really not meant to hold the balls well. We sent them back. Flimsy plastic that looks very unprofessional.
5,Hot mama!,This Nevra doll features curly hair and blonde streaks which is a first for our beloved Nevra. This is a well made and gorgeous doll! Go get her!
5,Fits Great!,Great bra at a great price. Was exactly what I was looking for. I tried this because Victoria's Secret no longer makes their plunge model and I loved it! Not to mention it costs less than half the price of the VS bra :)
3,It's worth the price,My only complaint is that the band is a bit too narrow. It doesn't fully cover my bit of fat on the sides by my boobs and underneath my armpits. It feels a bit tight because of that. Otherwise it's a perfectly good bra and the girls are happy.
3,Lyric prose,"This is a beautifully written story about a very messed up family. The prose is fluid and creates very vivid images. The character of Iliana and Aurelia are well drawn but the others are somewhat flat. It is a lovely story, and you care about the characters, which makes the ending even less satisfying. In each snapshot in the book a situation is introduced and then suddenly it's over. You want to know how things are resolved, you want more detail and more information and are left with the feeling that she simply ran out of things to say. Then she abruptly ended the book. It's a shame, because it could have been so very good. Nevertheless, it's worth reading if only for the vivid picture she creates of the lives of immigrants for whom the American Dream was only a mirage."
4,"Strange, haunting story, and well written","What made this story even more haunting for me was the realization that, although some reviewers disagree, people who are already mentally ill can become unglued by one rape, and people who are filled with superstitious ideas can become confused by religion; people who feel out of control will often let other people control them, and people who live with craziness struggle to find their own sanity.Are we supposed to believe in all the ""magic"" that happens in this story? I don't know. I think they are metaphors. Ms. Perez uses magic and religion and mental illness as tools to tell a story about people who get lost because they don't live the the lives they really want to live.While Iliana's intention to go home and help her family leads her back to her house, it's in her understanding that she can only live her own life and become who she WANTS to be, that she can really go home."
1,Let me tell you a story (This rating may not be completely fair),"I received this item, and inflated it. I then put it in my friend's boat. I never put any ice or beverages in it. The boat burned in the middle of the night. I found no trace of the cooler afterward. At this point, I had a revelation. THIS ITEM IS NOT FIREPROOF!!!!"
2,the Horror!,"...ignore the directions and get 800 speed film and only take pictures outdoors (on BRIGHT AND SUNNY days, and at HIGH NOON). Since its not very well made, you have to be very careful. And it hurts your thumbs to advance the film to the next frame. I like the supersampler better."
5,A classic!,"It is not easy to classify an artist such as Friedrich Gulda.This recording belongs to one of Gulda's ""standards"", a standard which is so high that most of modern pianists find it even hard to comprehend. Nevertheless, a few names whose great performances of Mozart are currently on the market come to mind . First, Gulda himself in a perfomance of Mozart's K467 with WIener Symphoniker ""Authentic Interpretation"". This recording surpasses even the current DVD with K466 and K537. Then there is a stunning Mozart CD by Andreas Staier with K.331, 332, 333 and Mozart CD with Robert Levin. This would conclude the list of artists who can argue with Gulda in Mozart. The Mozart year is coming in 2006 and we will hear much more of his music...One wishes 2006 never ends..."
2,A bit disappointing,"A long waited classical piece, but the release is a bit disappointing. The ochestra was scaled-down, and the piano soloist was the conductor himself. Wood pipes sounded a bit weak, certain camera appeared a bit out of focus, there was some ghost images throughout. Clearly there was audience coughing in the second movement."
4,Great Information,"I found this book to be well written and very easy to understand. For someone who has had companion birds for more than 20 years, I found this book to contain a wealth of information. The tips throughout the book are quite helpful and the stories from the author add a personal touch. This book will be an excellent resource for me for many years to come."
1,Jerry Strikes Out!,"After 6 years with the Muddy Waters Band I expected a CD in that same vein, Delta Blues, similar to what other former Muddy Water's musicians such as Bob Margolin, Willie Smith and Pinetop Perkins to name a few have produced. This CD shows potential on 2 or possibly 3 of the 15 songs. Otherwise, it seems to start but not run, percolate but never boil, and strikes out rather than hits a home run. I think that the song ""Shoulda Coulda Woulda"" more aptly describes this disk and should have been its title. if you like blues harp, I would recommend that you try RJ MISCHO instead."
1,Boring! Sooooo boring!,"I would really like to like this book. I really love French literature, and ""Un Coeur Simple"" is certainly a classic. But this story is simply terrible. It is boring, repetitive, and seemingly never-ending. There are aspects which are simply too strange, such as the symbolism of the parrot. Not a fun read."
4,It's that country and that ghetto,"Swamp Boogie is a lot like King himself unassuming, not terribly ambitious , yet Soulful and Playful. Interesting tunes include the snarling ""Mean Litttle Woman"" and the evocative ""Kinky Cotton Fields"" Both belong on a Movie sound track. I like the goofy Bo-Diddleyish instrucmental called ""The Great Chinese"" for reason I'd love to know. ""Cat Squall Blues"" is complex, delta acoustic fingerpicking that isn't taught so much as absorbed.All the transcription books in the world can't capture that kind of playing; It's a good thing LFK put it down for us."
3,Good solid jazz,"I had forgotten that I had bought this Album, until I was asked for a review. That is not to say it is bad. It isn't.It is good solid jazz, and great to have on in the background, when you are writing a review.I think I originally bought it because I love ""Body and Soul"" It's very sexy when played well.In conclusion, this is more an album for 'jazz purists' rather than the casual listener.I think I prefer vocal jazz.Paul Orr"
3,QUESTION,"The 2011 A.P. Language Test will reflect new changes (no penalty for guessing on the multiple choice questions, a slightly different format on the synthesis essay). I don't think Cliff's Third edition has been updated to reflect these changes yet, but I'm not sure (information seems missing on the product description) Does anyone know?"
3,Good rental if you like to fast forward between nude scenes.,One of my favorite nudity movies growing up. Computer Madness scene should have won some awards - with 5 fine women all taking off their tops to expose 10 fine boobs.
3,Time Warp,Lots of T&A. I think this movie wrecked a bunch of acting careers. 1 hr and 27 min that I will never get back.
2,Lousy lousy lousy software,"Wow. Truly lousy application. I originally bought a Lacie Silvescreen. I thought that the software on that was bad, but the Iomega screenplay is even worse. It's nice that the hardware has buttons so you can use it without the remote, but basically this thing is just unusable. At least the LaCie version recognizes folders, but the Screenplay just shows ALL files at the same time...very frustrating. Also, unlike the LaCie (which recognizes .ISO file formats...which allows you to access DVD menus,etc), the Iomega does not.Until this point, I really liked Iomega products, but I'll have to rethink that."
4,Does not fit 2 1/2 x 2 inch headphones,"This review is nothing against the product or seller (although the ear cushions are thinner than expected). Other reviewers are stating that these will fit Sony headphones measuring 2 1/2 x 2 oval. They can be tremendously stretched to fit, but they are then unbelievably thin and will certainly not last, as well as not providing enough cushioning! Do not buy these if you have oval ear pieces on your headphones that are 2 1/2 x 2 inches. Very disappointing. Again, not the seller fault. They actually arrived very quickly. At this point they are not worth returning and I have ordered other pads. I'll use these for the meantime, but please be accurate in your reviews. People do read and rely on them."
5,1Derful!!,"I loved it!!! It is awesome how you feel inside a concert of this amazing boys!!I know they won't come to my country any time soon, so this was the perfect way to make them sing to me everyday! If you love them as much as I do, You will never regret buying a copy of this DVD, specially if you're from NARNIA. 1DHQ"
3,Teeny-Bop Stuff,"This DVD is of the current day Teeny-Bop, Brain-Rotting 'music' group. I think it stinks but my 9th, and 6th grade girls 'L-O-V-E I-T"" and think the 1D boys are ""Utterly Del-Lish""."
5,True directioner,Great quality exactly what I wanted! If you love one direction you will love this. Shows the entire tour all the sets the boys look amazing and it's great
5,"Amazing photographs, beaufiful book.","Lawrence Grecco's photographs bridge the eroticism of the human figure with the exoticism of an ancient sport that is truly fascinating in every way. His compositional ability is exceptional; each of these images are powerful and almost every one of them can stand on their own quite well. The book itself is beautifully designed, almost antique looking with its cloth cover and adhered black and white photograph. This is THE BOOK on Turkish Wrestling."
1,Poor supplier,"The HD Component Tuner arrived approx. 5 business days after it was ordered.To my great dismay, the Tuner was poorly packaged & was received with unsightly scratches all over its front display screen!"
4,AM but not FM,"This product works very well with AM HD, but I have yet to receive FM HD. I bought this for AM HD, so it's not a problem for me. I am in an FM and TV ""dead zone"" between two hills, and I have not tried an outside antenna, so others may get better results. I have also learned that FM HD signals are 10 times weaker than their analog counterparts, so this may explain why so many people are having trouble with HD radio."
3,Sangean HDT-1 HD Radio Component Tuner,"Since I'm not knowledgable in the area of electronics, I found the Sangean HDT-1 HD Radio Component Tuner impossible to use with my existing stereo. I even bought an antenna and a home theater system, in an attempt to get HD radio. So far all attempts to install the products have failed. I expect that a more qualified person could use this component and would know what to use to make it perform as it should. I, however, intend to get an all inclusive HD radio when I find one."
3,My experience with this camera was dissapointing.,"My first impressions of the camera were 'wow, this is heavy.' It's no slab of concrete, but it does weigh substantially more than it's size would indicate. It seems fairly solid, but the little switches and levers are made of a cheaper grade of plastic.Halfway through shooting my second roll of film, the camera's manual winding advance just stopped working, frozen in place. You can imagine how annoyed I was. It's certainly very frustrating to spend $150 on a camera that refuses to work beyond it's first roll of film.Aside from its self-destruction, I was satisfied with the camera. It's not for those who want flawless images & extreme portability (try filling your pocket with rocks - the equivalent of the camera's weight and awkwardness in your jeans). If you're in the market for a quirky little camera with character, however, this product probably won't dissapoint you."
3,Trendy but hardly bullet proof,"I have had a Lomo for quite a while, drawn by the allure of lomography and a Russian camera. I have used my Lomo, too, and now it is beginning to fail miserably. I haven't used it enough to merit the kinds of problems I am beginning to have, either. If you are looking to follow a trend, this is a great camera for you as trends come and go. You will be on to the next trend before your camera gives up. If you are looking for a point and shoot camera where you have a little control over exposure, this is a good camera as long as you are willing to pay for the maintenance and overhaul. It's cheaper than a Rollei B35 but not as adjustable. If you are looking for durability in a camera, look elsewhere as you will shortly find yourself disappointed. But it did take nice pics while it lasted!"
3,Wrong Picture Displayed,"The computer is ok, yet the picture, that was displayed in Amazaon and in the store that the Amazon webpage send me, is the picture of a different computer. That is wrong because when you are buying someting you want to know what it look like, not to base one's purchase in someting that's not the truth."
3,"Engaging, If You're in the Mood","Sometimes I'm in the mood for a silly comedy, other times for a poignant drama; if I see one genre when I am not in the mood for it, then chances are it will flop with me. Baker's short novel ""The Mezzanine"" is full of the quirky details and insight you might expect. The prose is high quality and well connected, and despite the slow start, I enjoyed the perspectives the author shared. I suspect that, to some extent, I got more from the book as I am a male who has shared some of the office experiences in NYC that he describes. It is said that the best comedy has the most truth. That is, one can relate to it. I suggest that if you can relate to the book's theme, you won't be disappointed."
4,Delightful.,"Although not fully communicated by its title, Wilson was after something with as much substance and seriousness as capriciousness. For starters, this isn't a book. It's a broadside. It's no shorter than 8 pages (if memory serves) but not longer than twenty. It's a chimeral analysis of polarities and dependencies, systems that are flawed at their very core but wouldn't exist in any other state (viz. without Laurel, Hardy would never find himself if the ""fixes"" he does and Hardy would have no 'life' without Laurel...) Ultimately, this is a funny little tome with an almost reluctantly serious edge; well worth owning for the sheer delight of pulling it off your bookshelf in the company of a group of Colin Wilson fans who are ""absolutely"" certain they're familiar with all his writings. You get to say, ""Oh, yeah? Ever read this one?"" You can bet money one of those folks will plop right down in the nearest chair and read it on the spot. Count the giggles."
1,Probably Won't Last,"Curiously, the Amazon search page image for this product is different than what the actual product page displays. I had a pair of the black plastic rock 'n roll series plugs. They are made of a thin plastic/rubber compound, which makes them washable and thus reusable. Except for one problem. There is a stem in the middle of the plugs to help insert them into and pull them out of the ear. That stem broke on my other plug the second time I ever used it, rendering the plug unusable. I also found that the plugs were difficult to ""balance"", that is, get the same amount of sound filtering in each ear. That could, of course, be an anatomical issue. In any case, I would recommend some other type of plug for concert-goers."
1,No Good,"The thing just didn't fit in my ears!!!and the plastic case it's china's worse, don't even close properly"
4,To Build a Fire,Re-read this book for an online English class. I had forgotten how well London was able to convey the message of how you should listen to those who are only trying to look out for your best interests. I even went so far as to turn up the heat in my house after reading this book!
3,Happy families.,"The other two reviewers have the plot description. This is another fine story by Ms. Neels. If you read her stories you know what to expect-strong silent men, heroines who soldier on no matter the difficulty and no sex. The only part that annoyed me was that the fiancée was involved in the story too long. That being stated, another story that when you finally reach the end, you're smiling"
2,the series is not like the movie,"The series is definitely not like the movie: different style of animation, waaaaay too many villains with weird powers not skills, and unfortunately I got bored with the hero in the first episode, so then I can not speak of the story line, maybe I'm too old and too old school. So all I can say is if you're looking for edgy, ADULT, classic anime, this series is not it, save your money."
2,"great size, bad quality","This is the second unit we've had (ours broke so we got my mother-in-law's- she couldn't wait to get a better one) and both had the same problem. the convection button is a joke, the toast button burns everything it comes in contact with and the temperature is off. it's great if you're going to stand next to it and ""hope"" your toast brown but if you're looking for reliability, look elsewhere."
2,Poor quality.,Pros...Best toast settings we could find in a toaster oven today.Cons...Had to post a review of this item after it broke during the 1st week of service. Toaster dial knob broke. Free wheeled. I could have returned it but fixed it instead (void warranty or not). Loaded knob is super glue and stuck it back on. Still working.Also noisy timer. Annoying.
1,Too hot - dangerous for family use,"I purchased this unit from a local retailer. I was searching for something which would be not more than 17 inches wide and would sit on the counter, cook toast and the occationally bake something small.On the outside of the user manual it says ""Toaster-R-Oven, countertop oven"" however inside the manual it warns against placing the oven under a counter. Well, how many people have counter space, with an electrical outlet, which is not under a counter? I sure don't. Once I turned it on I quickly found out why they recommend this. The unit gets dangerously hot on the outside. So much so, that I returned the unit.If a child placed something on top of the unit, I am quite certain it would catch fire. The aluminum exterior conducts way too much heat to be safe."
4,A New Voice in Literature,"The strength of work can be found in the narrative The story capatures the reader and brings them into close proximity of each character. Further the authors voice is clear and profoundly inspired by the condotion of the free african-amercian, the educated african-amercian and their continued struggle for identity. The writer brings us into the condition of African Americans after the civil rights movement.I found the story moving in its telling and even with the errors a since clarity manifested in the content. I say keep writing...with that exsitential edge, keep telling the story through your fiction...post rebellion fiction."
1,What's with all the typographical errors?,"I'm sure this is a good book, but I really couldn't get past all the typos to enjoy this book. And to the reader who compared it to Hemmingway, sorry this author is not a Hemmingway. It is just bad editting. Seriously, I'm not even up to page 100. The mistakes are comparable to ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" or ""Scooby Doo"". It gets distracting seeing a footnote for a comma, a ""he"" for a ""she"", and other mistakes littered throughout the chapters. I'm sorry I wasted the money buying this book. Maybe if she publishes another edition, corrected, I'll think about reading it again."
2,the same old tired starry-eyed cliches,"sorry to demur from the outpouring of unfocused affection, but this book is awful. For anyone who has been for more than a casual trip to Rome, the author disappoints. Every old cliche is dutifully trotted out and dusted off. The language is uninspired, the insights pedestrian and lacking in flair, the egocentricity rampant. A banal addition to the travel bookshelf, fit mainly for those intrepid armchair travellers who prefer their fare pre-chewed."
4,shes cute,i think she is preety her clothes are ugly put different ones on duh.stop writing bad reviews about dolls they are just dolls so get over it if you don't like a doll keep it to yourself
5,My Scene dolls suck,"Bratz dolls are better. My Scene dolls are ugly, slutty, skimpy, stupid, dumb, retarded, messed up lips, straight ugly body, huge butts and boobs, horrible, terrible, lame, gay, evil, snobby, mean dolls. And theb limo does not come with wine. MGA does not put wine with toys. Are you stupid or something? MGA wouldn't put wine with a toy. Why would they? And the bratz dolls are 17 not 12. So shut up. Bratz rule and My Scene drule."
2,ALL ABOUT HAROLD BLOOM AND WHO CARES?,"This book covers a valuable subject and parts of it are excellent, but ultimately it fails because it is not about how to read but how Harold Bloom reads and he can't move away from his favorite subject to let in some fresh air. Here is a minor example: he pulls up one of Shakespeare's sonnets to condemn the Republicans who impeached Clinton. The sonnet CAN be read to attack people who condemn sexual impropriety while engaging in it themselves, but that would apply more strongly to Clinton himself than the Republicans. It was Clinton, after all, who wrote the law which allows the courts to pry into people's bedroom secrets. That he was caught by his own neo-Puritan law is perfect justice. But in the meanwhile, Shakespeare gets lost in Bloom's bloviating. This would be a far better book if Bloom gave his ego a rest and allowed his formidable intellect to do some heavy lifting for a change."
5,Rallying cry.,"It's doubtful that any author of less renown would find a publisher for this quick tour of literary landmarks along with plain-spoken commentary on the art of reading. The book is meant more to entice than to educate, yet one wonders if it will find its way into the hands of the eager, novice readers Bloom must have in mind. Nonetheless, the book is a fitting complement to the author's more pessimistic, elegaic ""Western Canon,"" and it effectively affirms the romantic-aesthetic quests of those of us who--in spite of post-structuralism, modern cultural studies, and the ""politicizing"" of all things aesthetic--find inexhaustible abundance in the life of art."
4,Modeling Personal Reading,"This book is not geared toward the academic, rather it is a popular book on reading quality literature. What this means is that Bloom does not spend time discussing the theory and techniques of literary scholarship and criticism, but instead models a very personal, pleasurable style of attentive reading. The length of the book precludes a thorough examination of any specific work. Instead it is a survey to whet the appetite, an aperitif. It is quite like an interesting few days spent with a lively and passionate professor who is able to draw out just enough of the subtleties of the works discussed to be an inspiration to the student. On this level, the book succeeds wonderfully, and will no doubt lead to more thorough works, such as Bloom'sShakespeare: The Invention of the Human."
4,A mother's trial,Very good book it was interesting. Would recommend . Very easy read. Enjoy yourself with this book have a good time.
3,I liked the book.,I guess I was just expecting more from this book. I enjoy reading true life stories but this one seemed kind of disjointed.
4,Good read,The book was very well written. I rated it a 4 because there was no pictures. It would of been neat to see the people they were talking about.
4,Moments of Brilliance,"""Stars"" contains some true moments of brilliance, most notably ""How Could I Fall"", the most beautiful ballad in Simply Red's repertoire (yes, even more so than ""Holding Back the Years""). ""Funny how the things that you can never have needle you more,"" Mick sings plaintively, and if your heart isn't breaking at that point, I don't want to know. ""Something Got Me Started"" is immediately infectious, and ""Freedom"" and ""Wonderland"" provide the by-now-expected political statements. Overall, ""Stars"" can be said (for better or worse) to represent a ""kinder, gentler"" Simply Red. I can't emphsasize strongly enough that ""How Could I Fall"" is worth the price of the entire album."
1,Technically proficient but boring,"This borders on elevator music. While I respect the playing and singing abilities of Simply Red, none of the songs on this CD have the same strong feel as their famous ""If You Don't Know Me By Now"", which I have just learned is a cover...""The Long and Winding Road"" by the Beatles is a good example of a song that has a softer touch, but still evokes great emotion.Regarding the lyrics, they're nothing special and nothing that hasn't been said before is on this CD.Given their skills, Simply Red should just take the greatest songs of decades ago and cover them."
4,Names become people,"While studying Talmud, the names of the scholars come up again and again, and you start to get hints of who they were. This book brings it together and places them in context in a very readable way."
4,Great challenge for a beginner,"I am very much a beginner when it comes to pilates. I previewed this video prior to participating with it. It does seem to go a little fast for me but that's one of the positives to a video is that once you watch it multiple times, the movements become second nature. I love the idea of each work out (diff. areas of the body) being 10 minutes so that you can mix and match. You can customize your workouts and that is a huge plus to me. Overall, I am quite pleased with the dvd. I was not familiar with Lara Hudson and had only attended a few reformer and mat classes at my local Y as well as trying Leslie Sansone's pilates video prior to this but I think she will quickly become one of my favs."
5,Awesome!,"I am very happy with this book stand! It holds my textbook very well and is very sturdy. I haven't had any problems at all with it. The color isn't very pretty, but it does it's job really well."
4,It is great!,Full explanation about endometriosis and hysterectomy and it is also a Bible to affected women to both endo and hysterectomy. Very specific and scientifically explained and lots of guidance or self-help resource advises.Tes T. FernandoAuthor: Feisty Diva (The Guide to Natural Beauty & Stamina After 40 or After Hysterectomy)[...]
4,A cool game with 130 teams and great gameplay.,"This is a great footy game. It has 130 teams and the gameplay is very realistic. If you love football, then you'll love this game. I think you should buy it if you have a Dreamcast because it is the best game available for the conolsole. Buy it now!"
2,Gameplay stinks !,"I bought this game the day it was released because I was starved for a soccer game on DC. Graphics-wise, it's quite good. But the gameplay is really bad. My biggest gripe is when you're defending. The console control doesn't switch to the desired player until it's too late to catch up with your opponent. At least your goalkeeper is good enough to keep the score down. The only problem is, your opponent's goalie is equally good. After playing so many hours, I've only managed to score a total of 3 goals. Even when you play as the best team against the worst team, it's next to impossible to beat them."
3,"Great player, completely agree with review by Zora","Masterful player, however sometimes hard to follow. Some basic explanation of chords and strings noted would have made it much better."
2,When Did Linguistic Professors Become The Go To Authority on Politics?,"During Geoffrey Nunberg's appearance on C-SPAN, where he commented on this book to a meager gathering at a bookstore, he practiced the fine art of polemics with heretics who expressed their dissenting opinions of the author's conclusions.Nunberg was particularly troubled with a question that challenged the validity of the premise of his book. It was not ""Liberalism,"" declared the speaker, that was being defined, but Liberals, and not by Conservatives, but by Madison Avenue. Well, what is a linguistic professor, who is set in his ideological ways, to do but perform linguistic gymnastics to confuse the point?At least Nun berg doesn't abdicate complete ratiocination to Liberal blogs that champion stolen election theories and White House conspiracies to ""out"" Valerie Plume, but he still reserves his credentials as a mis-assigned linguistic professor posing as a political scientist in the mold of Noam Chompsky."
3,Interesting...,"Greg Iles does a great job portraying the women's view on some very difficult subject matter and emotions. The lead in to the plot and characters gives the reader a chance to digest and delve into each character and scenario. However, the book was a disappointment in using the tired ""victim-good cop"" love interest that is prevalent in so many ""thrillers"". Many of the conversations dragged and took too long getting to the point. Overall, I was disappointed!"
4,Twinkies saved the day!,"CD/abridged: Twinkies saved the day! I'm serious. Just weeks after Twinkies were pronounced deceased by Hostess, I'm listening to a book were Twinkies save the day.First, this book gained points with me because I was expecting Dick Hill narrating it. However, Susie Breck read it instead. She did a really good job as the voice of Jordan Glass.Jordan is a loner and photographer who travels the world. While in Asia, she sees an art exhibit of the ""Sleeping Women"". Rumor and conjecture is that the pictures are really of dead woman. Then Jordan recognizes one of the women. It's herself...or her twin sister.I liked that the book went in another direction than I expected. It was easy on the brain and I recommend it."
2,Too Preachy,"I was disappointed in this book. I enjoyed the plotline and it kept me somewhat interested, but the main character, Jordan, was kind of annoying. The author should have let the actions of the character lead us to discovering the character traits of Jordan. It seems the flow of the story slowed as we had to read speeches about what a strong, tough independent woman she was; how she had been in so many dire situations, etc. This could have been done more subtlely in my opinion, not hammered home at every instance. Some of the reviews here say Iles other books are good, so maybe I give his new release a read based on the clever plot here that kind of fell apart at the end."
1,i may not even qualify to review this book........,"Ok, I am a big fan of action/thriller/suspense novels. I opened this one thinking it would be good. I'm one of those people that gives every book a chance. So i started reading this and i couldnt even get to page 100. I was falling asleep. And i was also annoyed. I didnt like the Jordan Glass character at all. She tries to pull off this tough, gritty persona, and she pretends that she doesnt think she's attractive. Ii'm aware that she is attractive from the beginning, but it keeps going on about it.And she has this habit of thinking that every man she meets is going to make a pass at her. Even when he's not making a pass, she thinks he is. I was just so fed up with this character that I closed the book and put it on my bookshelf for decorative reasons. Hey, its a nice looking book, you know? why not. anyways, i guess I'm looking for something a little more tough and a little more thrilling."
5,Top Book EVER!!!,"How could you NOT give this a 5 star rating. It is possibly the best book I have ever read. . . definitely in the top 2 or 3! It will keep you guessing until the very end. . . You just won't figure it out! It is gory, and I tend not to like gory, but I really did love this book!"
2,After all the great reviews I was disappointed,"After reading all the great reviews about this movie I was disappointed to see what I saw. Don't take me wrong. I love chick flicks, but this one in particular just does not seem to be right.Although the problems (like the racism and the domestic abuse) touched upon in this movie are real, their depiction in the movie is weak and forced and somehow lifeless. I understood that the creators of this movie wanted to say but they did not persuade me.Maybe this movie just did not age gracefully."
3,Heartwarming.,"Fried Green Tomatoes starring Kathy Bates and Jessica Tandy is definitely a chick flick to say the least. I like this weepy drama but this film is a little too long and depressing. I do appreciate the great acting and friendship concept, watch this film with a best friend. Rent it sometime."
5,Must have for a collection.,This was purchased as a gift for my daughter. This movie is already a classic and is one that most will watch many times.
5,Excellent,This is a great version of the movie. If you're a fan of the movie then you should definitely get this one.
5,Excellent Film!,"I won't go into a synopsis on the film as that is done in other reviews. But I just have to say that is one of my favorite films. It is about true friendships, loyalty, and empowerment. There are some sad moments in the film, but overall it is very uplifting. I have seen it numerous times and never get tired of it.I recently visited Juliette, GA where the film was actually shot, which prompted me to watch the movie again when I got home. The town still looks pretty much like it did in the movie, including the Whistle Stop Cafe! You can eat at the cafe, and some of the other buildings in the town have been turned into gift shops now. If you are a fan of this film and ever in Georgia, stopping there is a must."
5,A Classic Film of Deep Love,"This film is beautiful, heartbreaking,and very real. It also carries the disturbing fact of racism, as well, and makes it so evidently horrible in the light of the circumstances. It is a beautiful film and a classis film with remarkable acting."
5,ATMOSPHERE AT ITS BEST,"This is a magical movie that pulls you into it and when it is finished, deposits you back in your living room. Every character is so well written,and the double story line is done to perfection. You will want to try Fried Green Tomatoes and go visit Whistle Stop after you see this one!"
5,A Great Classic,"I love this movie. It's an oldie, but goodie! All the actors do an excellent job. A great story of friendship, family, love....etc. Would recommend to watch over and over!"
5,Simply great!,I saw this movie for the first time a few years ago and seeing it again was even more fun. Kathy Bates is great in her role and also Jessica Tandy and Mary Stuart Masterson. I loved the movie and someday I will try out those green fried tomatoes.
4,Nice-looking tank style watch,"This watch is a classic tank design for that tailored look, easy to read and comfortable. It's a substantial size but not so large as to look like a man's watch, which is nice for those of us with big hands or large wrists. The strap is a little stiff, but that's the only complaint I can muster about it. Will fit from about 5-1/2"" to 7-1/2"" wrists."
5,fossiling in florida,"Having canoed MANY times down the Peace River in Arcadia, FL over the last 20+ years - and knowing nothing re fossiling there - saw a newspaper article on the fossiling and couldn't wait to get back. Took our almost 9 year old son (whom we have now nicknamed ""the fossil pro""), we had a ball! Then we heard about Mark Renz, and will be booking with him the next trip. Also, have a scout trip planned just from the collection our guy found there. Ordered the book for a surprise for third grade graduation next week. He's hooked, as are we!! Brian's Mom and Dad"
5,high road to china,one of the best movie experiences I have had. Good story line wonderful actors. Tom Selleck and Bess Armstrong have that presence on the screen that I last saw and enjoyed with Gable and Colbert when I was a kid. The musical score by John Barry is hauntingly beautiful and sets the mood of the film. My vhs copy has been repaired twice from viewing. One of those movies that never become so familure that it becomes less enjoyable to watch.
1,Poor Quality,"First, I love the movie itself. The reason for the bad rating is that I have received two copies of the blu-ray version and the sound does not work on either of them. I checked other blu-ray films immediately after and had no problems; therefore, the assumption is that the problem is with the High Road to China release."
4,Thoroughly Enjoyable Movie,"Every few months I remember to look on Amazon again for this ""Not Yet Released"" DVD in hopes it'll finally be available. So far no luck (for US region DVD's anyhow). I've seen this film maybe 4 times over the years and enjoy it every time. If the DVD gods won't supply us with one hopefully I'll catch it on a commercial free channel so I can Tivo it and make my own DVD, well worth the effort. For lovers of flying, WWI era stories, or adventure-romance-comedy, this is a fun film."
5,"The oxen are slow, but the earth is patient.","It's been about over twenty years since I've seen this movie. But I can remember loving it as a kid watching with my father. Starring Tom Selleck, his mustache, and the mom from MTV's cult show ""My So-Called Life"", I have been waiting over a decade for this movie to be released on DVD. Here it comes on DVD and Blu-ray no less. I may just order both, one for me, one for my father, and update this review to be helpful to those less familiar with this lost treasure."
5,Selleck classic,"Is a required Tom Selleck movie. Tom at his best , flying scenes are super. story and action is great!!!!"
3,High road to China,"We didn;t understand the region 2 idea, but were able to make the change on our laptop so we could see it. Now to figure out how to do it for the big screen."
3,pretty fun but boring too,"this game is one of the best hunting games out there but it did lack sound .it was pretty sad.this game gets you confused by the way they set up their controls too.ten minutes in to the game and you find that there is nothing else to do but shoot elk,deer,and rams and bears.once you get used to it,its a pretty fun game though"
1,Not an intelligent read,"I read this book out of desperation - I was on vacation with nothing else to read. What a waste of time and paper. The plot was silly and the characters weak. I find it hard to believe this book was written for adults, aside from some mild sexiness. I can't imagine anyone over the age of 14 enjoying this book."
5,The Best One Yet From Pike,"I have read many books from Pike, but this one is the best yet.I can't even explain how good it is. I have read it so many times,and every time I read it I find something new out. A rollarcoaster"
5,Wacky Races,"It is just as great as the show. Its similar to DiddyKong Racing(even though the Amazon review says its similar to SouthPark Rally which it's no where near.),just with a small hub world. This is the best Wacky Races game I have played. It is a bit difficult, but don't worry it has cheats to make it easier. If its to easy there is a cheat to make it harder. The AI is very well done, only the bosses are cheap. The other drivers are trigger happy, they will attack anything that gets near them(mostly other AI). Definitely worth the money."
1,Did not work well for me,"This is the 2nd Rug Rat I purchased. Both did the exact same thing. After using it for a very short time (once or twice for a few minutes each time), it stops working properly. The brush barely moves as if it's stuck. There was hardly any pet hair in it, but I cleaned it out and had the same problem. Even when it worked, it didn't work great. Makes a lot of noise but doesn't do a whole lot. It does not work well when used on bedding, as there is no way for air to flow, so it locks up the brush. It worked better on furniture that was a more rigid construction. As soon as their is looser fabric, it loses power. I have yet to find one of these things that work well. Years ago I had one that looked very much like the Rug Rat but it was made by Kirby. It also had a vent slide on the side to control air flow. It was awesome! I had it for many, many years. It finally broke and now I can't find anything to replace it."
1,Don't do it!,"This phone stinks! It was great for a month or so and I loved all the features (color screen, camera, etc). Then I found that it does take pics all the time. AND I have found that it changes ringtones arbitrarily, won't show the person's picture who is calling (just a black box), won't let me answer calls, vibrates instead of rings, the picture quality is HORRIBLE. I am going to go back to the much favored Nokia or Motorola phones that have been so wonderful in the past. Do not buy this phone if you don't want the headache that goes along with it."
1,Buggy software - crashes a lot,"The phone crashes a lot. Sometimes I get calls and though I can hit 'answer', I can't hear anything. Nor can the person on the other end hear me.Sometimes the screen turns into garbage.Power-cycling fixes the problem. I have these problems every 2-3 days regardless of whether I use the phone a lot or not at all.I plan to return the phone."
1,I wuz robbed,Same problem happened to me -- mic cuts out. I hoped it was just the phone. I returned it and got a new one (probably refurbished). I wish I had done some research before I got it. Oh well.
1,This phone is a piece of junk,"My wife and I both own this phone. Needless to say we are both disappointed with the poor quality. The main problems we encountered are:1) The phones will go into a weird state at random; The phone appears to be working but will not receive calls or make calls. The only way to get the phone to work again is to physically remove the battery and then replace it. When the phone reboots it will work.2) The camera quality is poor and the images are compressed too much. Plus, because of where the camera button is located, it is fairly easy to unknowingly take dozens of pictures of the inside of your pocket or purse.3) One of the phones died after 11 months. The inside screen was toast.I am surprised that some people actually like this phone. Our experience has been that these phones are junk."
5,Best bang per Buck,"I was nervous about purchasing a less than mainstream phone after using Nokia for years but glad I tried the Sony. The features list is impressive there are very few phones with as many features anywhere near this price. Navigation is slightly odd and I have heard others complain of the camera performance but since I dont use it I can't comment. Battery is good for three days of heavy use, reception is also good..no real complaints!"
1,Horrible Phone,"I actually got this phone at the Cingular store. It has been the worst phone I've ever owned in my life. I read somewhere that the software that runs this phone has memory leak issues, and I am here to say IT DOES. After the phone has been on for a day or so without being shut off and turned back on, the ring tone starts to skip like a record with a scratch in it, then when I go to my menu of items, black squares appear where the icons should be, the games won't load up and there have been many times when I couldn't hear the caller, etc.Please buy another phone. I still trust the Sony name, but I am weary of their phones after this experience. Can't wait to get another phone. The Nokias and Motorolas I had in the past never had issues like this piece of s**t."
4,Bring the club home to you,"A live setting proves to work its charms for this young quartet. Led by pianist Ben Waltzer and tenor Bill McHenry, the band turns in an intimate recording that brings the Pipa Club right into your living room. The piano work of Waltzer works well on ""Time Is On My Hands"" with great results from the right hand and a great McCoy Tyner-esque left. The stand-out tack of the sessions is ""Eix"",a groovy number that satisfies and showcases the tightness of the quartet. Waltzer is a gifted young talent in the world of traditional jazz and his output should impress jazz aficianados for years to come."
5,An excellent tracking book,"I'd heard good things about this book when I purchased it, but I never expected it to be this good. Anyone with a sincere interest in tracking or naturalism would be thrilled by this book. From the novice tracker to the advanced wildlife professional, this book provides priceless details for any user.This is hands-down the greatest tracking book I've ever seen, and I unconditionally recommend it to anyone interested in the wildlife and the outdoors."
5,love this stuff,working with this alone its very very soft and does feel rubbery after it bakes it flexible mixed a very very small amount with my other clay and it made it softer and easy to work with love it mixed with the flesh colors makes it look like real skin just have to make sure it is mixed together really well or it will leave light colored spots after it baked.more of a flat or matter finish.love this stuff just for making my harder clays soft and workable
1,STICKY AND FINALLY USELESS FOR MOLDING,"I have great respect for sculpey products in general, but this socalled Moldmaker is a complete disappointment since you open it. Indeed,... it is really sticky and the use of some powder helps very little, because the ""stickiness"" remains and it is imposible to get a good setting for your mold. Even worst, when you want to separate the Master from the mold, if it comes off without a part of your new mold would be a miracle!. Another thing, they say that the mold will remain flexible after cooking at the right time and temperature, something wich I did- and this is not true at all,....in my case, after the third use I did of the mold made with this product it was alrady brittle and useless. Believing that this product would be great-good I bought almost a dozen of them and I am done, because I am not to going to be able to do any good molds with it. Do not waste your money please."
2,I Was Not Moved,"I am a domestic violence educator within a prison setting, and, based on the first review, I thought this video would be a unique and powerful way of introducing prospective class members to the issue of domestic violence. In my opinion, while the actual song wasn't bad, the video itself seemed a little bit ""corny"". In terms of having a strong emotional impact, I think overall the video fell flat and I decided to return the DVD for a refund."
4,Alternative Band,"For the price its a really good band, fits well and comfortable. Make sure this is the right size for your watch 18mm, its a bit smaller than normal watches - 20mm."
2,Works but better to spend a few dollars more.,The quality is lacking. The band is thin and feels cheap. The buckle is flimsy. For a few dollars more you can get a quality product.
3,Voguestrap TX1802BK 18mm Watchband,The watchband fit just fine and is good looking. But the nylon is flimsy and is already beginning to fray after just a few wearings. It may not last too long. I would prefer a heavier gage nylon and would pay a little more.
4,not bad for the money,"It is what it is. A cheap, easy to install watchband which doesn't look too shabby. If it lasts a year, I will consider it a bargain. So far, so good."
3,why is this movie so funny???,"Maybe I'm just cynical but, this movie cracked me up. Sex in a monastery, castration, clergy in funny hats, this movie has everything. And the 80's keyboard music, really captures the spirit of medieval France. Watch it and laugh heartily."
5,caress@lightstream.net really wants to find it...,"I've heard so much about this movie, and my Aunt has been looking for it for years. I'd really love to find it for her for her birthday. If anyone has a copy they'd like to sell, or knows of where I can get one, please contact me. Thanks!!"
3,"Good music, horrible sound quality","I eagerly bought this CD/DVD of The Killers playing live at the Royal Albert Hall and I was sorely disappointed. The music and performance are good, but the sound is terrible. The CD sounds like it was a bootleg recording, all the instruments sound extremely dull. Only Brandon Flower's singing makes it through the speakers sounding somewhat clearly but everything else is washed out. I don't know what they did to produce such a poor album soundwise but it's a shame and not worth the money I paid for this.The DVD sounds slightly better than the CD, but again I don't think audiophiles will be too impressed by the qiality here either."
3,Good product but don't buy from Discount Vitamins,"I used to buy this in 30 bead packs at Walgreens and was happy with it. I thought it would be great to save money by buying the 90 bead pack. When I opened the package, the beads were brown on one side. I don't believe that Discount Vitamins stored them correctly. Don't buy from them."
3,mislabeled and obviously old,"I like this brand, but it was listed as 90 beads; 30 beads was what was shipped. Also--even though the expiration date was okay, these obviously were old or had not been stored properly because they were miscolored, and some were even leaking."
5,One of my favorite books as a little girl,"""Mandy"" by Julie Andrews Edwards is a delightful tale about an orphan who finds an abandoned cottage and tries to make it her own. Mandy's character is easy to love and you are drawn right into the story. Whenever Mandy is hiding from her roommate, you are holding your breath right along with her! There are several hard lessons that Mandy has to learn and I think that once she's set on the right track, she makes a good role model for girls everywhere.I would definitely recommend this book. And if you enjoy this story, you'll probably likeThe Secret Garden (HarperClassics)by Frances Hodgson Burnett."
5,A must read for any age.,"I borrowed this from the library, I loved it so I sent it to my granddaughter. She was so excited to get it in the mail and has just started reading it. I know she will love it, it is such a touching story."
4,works well,i like this product. it does take the yellow off your nails. a little oily when applied but it does work. i recommend this to anyone who has yellow on their nails. great buy too !
1,Crap-Dirty-Falling apart,"I bought this book for a girlfriend of mines gift. The book arrived filthy, and the binding was so rough there was pages falling out. Terrible sale"
5,SHUT UP!!,"Ok 1st of all, bruinbear, you are a retard!! if you look up to a DOLL for an example, you need imidiate help, like therapy. someone should whip YOU!!! these are DOLLS, peices of PLASTIC, a play toy!!!!! anywho, i love this toy and i have all of the dolls, and meygan is my fave :)"
2,Not intended for MacIntosh users!,"It would help, when advertising the availability of books on computer software, to indicate what platform the book is written for. For MacIntosh users, this book is next to useless! The CD that accompanies this book is for PC's only; there is nothing on it of use to Mac users. Additionally, the authors state that the best browser for use with Front Page '98 is MS Internet Explorer, etc., etc. The whole tone of the book gives you the impression that the authors are employees of Microsoft."
4,Assembly is a nightmare!,Good luck on putting this together. The instructions are useless and only include the parts lists. I had to go back to the store and study the one already assembled and talk with the back room boys to ask questions. There is absolutly no reason that instructions can't be included with some diagrams.
5,This was my favorite book when I was a little girl,This book was my favorite book when I was a little girl. It taught me to belive in myself even when others were doubtful and to always belive in others.
5,The Secret Three,The book came in excellent condition and as a used item you just never know. This purchase gained my confidence in the rating system of items purchased used. My granddaughter was thrilled to get the replacement copy as her book had been destroyed accidentally. It arrived quickly and in excellent condition. You put a smile on a 5 year old child. Thank you for allowing the process to flow so smoothly.
3,good coverage,"The subject matter is enormous, but the only one I could find that approached everyday types of conflict. Helpful, but no panacea."
2,Book needs to be updated,"I agree with J Bock Shutterbug. ""Was a good book, however the book was written over 11 years ago and is past its prime. Written with a focus on film (including an entire chapter on choosing the correct film). Moon and Sun tables found in the appendix only go up to 2010.""I was disappointed with the book when I realized it was from 2000. My fault. I should have paid closer attention to that.But the book needs to be updated for digital. I would also love to see time of day/camera/lens info with each photo."
2,Stop Me If You Heard This One Before,"Death Pop? Honey I've been into dark pop (Death rock, goth, darkwave, whatever they're calling it these days) since Sex Gang Children (who? read your gothic rock book). Orgy are to goth what supermarket checkout tabloids are to literature. Still, they are kinda cute and some of the production is not half bad (after all it was produced by Dave Ogilve (who? See Skinny Puppy). If any of you who marvel at the originality of Orgy's sound are at all interested in seeing where this comes from, try some of these bands: KMFDM, Crocodile Shop, The Sisters of Mercy, Ministry (early), Front Line Assembly, Alien Sex Fiend, NIN, etc. I'm not saying Orgy is terrible, but it is very obviously a corporate construct designed to make Jonathan Davis rich."
2,It's alright,Well I bought this CD at a garage sale for 1$ because I liked Blue Monday and well for 1$ I'll buy pretty much anything. This album just didn't keep me interested while I was listening to it I guess it's just not my kind of music but you should buy it just for Blue Monday because that's a kick ass song.
2,Erratic effort.,"I give it two stars for Blue Monday and Stitches. Each song related to some part of a serious relationship. I, myself, just recently got out of one and can relate to the messages conveyed in the two songs. As for the rest, it sounded like they created the instrumental and threw in words overnight. Better luck for them on the next album."
2,"If you like Orgy on MTV, just get the singles","I give Orgy only two stars because they got two really great songs--Blue Monday and Stitches--and Revival has promise, but other than these, all their songs blow. Their guitars sound just as bad as someone scratching their nails on a chalkboard, so can you imagine them going on and on in all twelve songs? Plus the beat to many of these songs are just plain bad and amplify the grotesqueness of their horrid guitar sound. The lyrics aren't bad, I guess, but I think if Orgy wants to stay in the game, they need to change their sound (probably with different guitars) and make some better songs."
2,2 Great tracks but thats about it!,"Orgy is a very impressive group and they have a few songs to prove it. Stitches and Blue Monday are great songs, but the other songs aren't all that great. If your a big fan of Korn you may wanna look into this cd, i did. There isn't much to say about the cd"
4,Good,"Orgy is a strong band who is sure of there musical ability and do what they want. They were the first band released on KoRn's label Elementree. Jonathan Davis guest stars on Revival(he does the chorus). Orgy loses it on the first track Social Enemies. It's kind of techno, and I don't really like that, but the rest of the album is good. Stitches and Fetisha are the best songs. Buy the Family Values Compilation CD because it has Orgy on it too."
3,"I like it, but I don't know why.","This CD sounds like white noise at times, others it sounds like straight guitar thrashing. I prefer a real guitar over a synth, but Amir has some serious talent, although it's a bit hard to appreciate at times. The whole aura of the CD is sort of a techno-metal-experimental rock idea, and to some extent, the theory works. I can at least give Orgy props for trying something new. I just feel that it needs to be a bit more refined. They need to hire some one new to write lyrics, though, because what's here sounds like prattling poetry with no real value whatsoever. It sounds cool, but some actual content needs to be inserted somewhere."
2,NOT GOOD AT ALLLLLLLLL,"Okay, I really liked Blue monday but..this whole CD is horrible. The only good song really is ""blue monday"" and maybe stiches but I didn't even really like that song. It has to be one of the worst CDS i have sooooooo....to break everyones heart wanting me to say this is a good CD, i'm sorry it's really bad all the songs are horrible, cept for Blue Monday. I really like that song. I'm out"
3,Eh... Mediocre if you ask me,"Once upon a time I read an article where Orgy was asked where they got their lyrics from. Not surprisingly they said the lyrics were all just ""fantasy stories"" that were ""picked out of no where"", and it shows on this CD. Such poignant sayings as ""they say I'm jaded, 'cause they know it's true"" really show the band's lack of, *gasp*, work on this album.All in all it's not a bad CD. If you're into the whole grundge, techno, sounds-coming-from-every-direction kind of music, it isn't that bad. But if you are going to sift through the lyrics looking for real substance, look elsewhere. Orgy has to try harder on their next album."
2,"Ok to listen to, but not a masterpeace.","This cd is ok to listen to, but it's nothing to get really excited about. Their remake of Blue Monday is their big hit from this cd and I hate to say it but probably their only hit. They'll probably one day be a One Hit Wonder.....But fans of weird stuff or the underground I think will love the cd."
4,Very Good,The people that dislike this CD are obsessed KoRn fans. Just becuase they come off of Elementree doesn't mean they have to sound like Korn. I think this is a great CD. Lots of emotional songs. It's a good mix of rock and industrial.
5,Thiz cd kikz azz,Im really into thiz type of music I thunkz that Blue Monday iz the bezt 80z cover up even though they are too technoie the only kik azz zong iz Blue Monday LONG LIVE KORN LIMP BIZKIT ORGY AND RAMMSTIEN
1,Is this country music?,"I was unpleasantly surprised when I heard this album by Orgy. I followed them when they were big in Atlanta and boy have they changed! They use to be a country music outfit and once almost opened for Mr. Garth Brooks himself! Did they sell out? I dunno. All I knows is that this music of theirs now (do the kids call it industrial?) is hogwash. If you love country music like I do, don't buy this album because Orgy has changed."
1,BUTT CANDY!,Orgy is one of the most untalented bands out there. Their cover of New Order's 'Blue Monday' is sickening at best. I want to vomit everytime I hear it on the radio or see it on MTV. Their utter lack of originality and musicianship makes me wonder where all of the good music has gone.
5,So much more than the title says...,"Okey, so you like industrial/goth (I really hate that word) music that is interesting, edgy, and awesome without all the controversy and hype? Well, Orgy has it. I'm serious. They have talent and it is just great. Manson is the ""leader"" of goth type music, but he has no talent, and is all shock. Pity that only 2 songs off of this cd were released though. A lot of anger in these songs, and frankly, some of it is quite...odd...well that is the nice way of putting it. But, with beats that can get ANY wallflower on the floor, and great lyrics from Jay *swoons* well, this cd is flat out awesome. Not to mention that these boys are just flat out drop dead gorgeous. Catchy tunes that most people will probably walk around singing. Great talent, let's see some more boys. Okey, I'm rambling..."
2,I wouldnt say its the best,"ive heard lots of people say that this is a good cd. But i think that its not that good. They are like Marylin Manson impersonators and i think Marylin Manson may be a little better although i dont really like either of them. But its not a bad cd, but not really the best."
3,"Good Cd, could be better","""Blue Monday"" is an incredible song. i think that it is best played on the Family Values 1998 Cd. The drumming is just incredible. The sound quality is perfect for the song. Also, the song is just great. The rest of the Cd isn't nearly as good, though. Track one and two, hold their own, and help to better the Cd, but it still doesn't seem complete. Overall, tohugh, if you like Orgy, this is a Cd for you."
1,A sorry excuse for anything with guitars!,"I'm a major heavy metal fan, and a friend of mine who is also a metal fan bought the CD. I didn't ask him what it was like because I assumed it was heavy. The next day I went out and bought it and I must say, What a dissapointment. I listened to it and I discovered it is a disgrace to KoRn's Elementree Record Label. So if you like metal and think about buying this album, think twice!"
4,"Well I'm Impressed, how about you?","Allright, I know I'm a breakbeat Dj, but I'm so into this band called ""Orgy"". Wow, I mean who comes up with this mix of 80's air suply/flock of seaguls with NIN/Gravity Kills? And what a killer cover of New Order! And who is this Marylin Manson girl they keep comparing them too? I love to watch the dance floor as I throw this on the speakers, they go wild! Yeah, Orgy is cool, cool with their electronic synth and screaming vocals! yeah!"
4,Great for meats,"This is a great pan for grilling meats.....We love it...However, it is a pain to clean up....."
1,Not worth it at all!,This is only 0.165oz of cream. the volume is about half of your thumb. It is not worth $5 and $5 shipping.
1,ordering the wrong thing,"Can not review this item because I ordered the wrong thing,I had to reorder the correct one recently! I hope it is theright one"
5,good sources,"Purchased this for a young man who enjoyed the book. He loved it, said it was well done."
3,"Review of ""Flying Away""","""Flying Away"" is Smoke City's first and only full length Album (currently). This album was released in 1998, and features an electronic/bossa-nova trio, consisting of Marc Brown, Chris Franck and Nina Miranda. The song one has most likely heard is ""Underwater Love"" which was on a Levis commercial in the late 90's. Of the 10 tracks on the CD, the best are ""Mr. Gorgeous (And Miss Curvaceous)"" and ""Flying Away."" If you enjoy this album, also check out ""Formica Blues"" by Mono, and be sure to hear Astrud Gilberto, Stan Getz and Antonio Carlos Jobim of the original Bossa-Nova movement from the 60's."
2,"2 year old's verdict: ""It's weird.""","My two year old is obsessed with the Letter Factory and Word Factory Leap Frog DVD's. She asks to ""Watch Froggies"" all the time, and we are happy to comply. But when I put ""Let's Go to School"" on and they started dancing on rainbows with a magic fly or some junk, she said ""No no no I don't like it. It's weird."" I think we'll stick with the letter and word factories."
2,um..interesting,We have the other leap frog videos..WE love them..this one I dont' love so much.Here's the thing...They go through all the letters and they say like a stands for apple..b stands for ball..blah..blah..get to the x and say x stands for Exit...Um no it doesnt...Exit starts with E...my 4 year old says..mommy thats weird exit starts with e not x...glad she caught it..but they should have noticed that!!!
4,Good starting point,A must purchase for anyone considering entering the field. I wish there was more about picking the right masters program/graduate school. It is a really comprehensive book detailing a lot about salaries etc. and I haven't found any book comparable to it.
5,"Fun, Fun, Fun","Enjoyed this game and have to say with so many options and levels, this was certainly a bargain. Thoroughly enjoyed it and best of all no software glitches."
2,Received it really quickly.,"I ordered this game along with Inspector Parker. I've yet to play it, but think it will be pretty fun, really."
4,Great Game,"I love this game. I received it for Christmas one year and played it constantly. It's great for adults who like ""Puzzles"" or children who like searching for things. Fun game."
2,NOT a '98 platform as STATED.,"My 82 year old Mother really loves these games and keeps her busy for hours on her OLDER computer. Unfortunately, I bought this game BECAUSE it stated: compatible with Windows 98 BUT when it arrived..............system requirements state: Windows 7, Vista & XP. This was a Mother's day gift but doesn't work on her computer. We both are so BUMMED. We're in different states and she lives alone. Sellers: Get your info right!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!My Mom lost out for Mother's Day."
3,it's mostly about forced communication,It doesn't say what comunication is about generally. It focus on the manipulated sense of imputing doctrines into public historically. So it mostly deals with relation between political structures and its forced education of public in it.
5,Game Review,"the game is excellent, a lot fun, one of the best games ever,i would have liked a better more protective case for the cds, the case is very thini would have liked to receive the manuals for the games, they used to come with the cds before, like the one age of empires 3 now"
4,Best PC game out there,"I rarely buy PC games, but this one is definitely worth a look. The first one is generally regarded as one of the best PC games of all time, and the second one is even better. Plus, it is insanely cheap, if you don't already have it, buy it."
4,Age of Empires 1 & 2,Everything came as advertised. Clearly AOEII is better than 1 in graphics. My son plays often and seems to enjoy it immenseley.If you like strategy games its a great deal for the price.
2,Get what you pay for,Very dissapointing its a great deal to have the games in a bundle but why are all the games and expansion packs on the same disk cause problems and wouldnt play conquerss on my PC
4,Excellent Kit Lens,"Pro: Very sharp for a kit lens, very light, very small. Good focal range (28-84mm full-frame equivalent), really well built for a plastic lensCon: plastic mount, not that fast (5.6 at the longest end)This lens is so light and small that even if you have better ones, you should still have it in your camera bag as a backup. As a primary ""walk-around"" lens, it's more than up to the task."
4,Good kit lens but not perfect especially in low light,"I bought the Olympus 14-42mm lens as part of the Olympus E-620 kit. Overall I am quite happy with the 14-42mm as a general-purpose lens, particularly for outdoor, daytime use. It is light weight and the zoom range is useful for landscapes at the wide end and portraits and closeups at full zoom. In good light this lens is capable of producing clear and crisp pictures that are not noticeably less clear at the edges than in the center (as expected given the four-thirds crop). Focusing is reasonably fast though I have been unable to get the lens to focus in some conditions, particularly in low light. The aperture range is fine for outdoor shooting though often not bright enough for indoor/low light conditions. Also, it is hard to achieve a shallow depth of field with this lens though it is possible at full zoom."
2,Where did he find the time?,"As personal memoirs go, you have to give them a lot of slack but this one pushes the limits. The reader is challenged to swallow the author's story that in a little more than six months he single-handedly killed the enemy (occasionally in hand-to-hand), captured large scores of Germans, shot down aircraft, knocked-out tanks, and most importantly looted his way across war-torn Europe. I was left wondering if I had somehow missed his personal discovery of Hitler's bunker. Small wonder there was no other collaboration with anyone else in the 84th."
1,Hard to Believe,"I have read many books on fighting in the European theater in WWII. I have also heard first hand accounts from my uncles who fought in Europe including one who was a tank driver under Gen. Patton. I must say I found Roscoe Blunt's book hard to believe. He states he received special training to defuse landmines and bombs. But after being in combat for serveral months he never was called upon to use his special training. At one point during the Battle of the Bulge he mentions he leaves his foxhole alone, at night to reconoiter thru a minefield toward German lines then becomes disoriented and lost. If that is an example of how a ""battle tested"" soldier acts then it's amazing he lived to tell the tale.I have to believe most of what is written in this book is highly embellished to say the least."
3,in series,"is included as episodes in season 1 set, nothing extra for the price. season 1-4 sets better thou no ending."
5,Gotta get back... back to the Samurai Jack,"Samaurai Jack is an oddly wonderful cartoon series from Cartoon Network and Gennady Tartakov (of Dexter's Lab fame). It is like nothing you've ever seen on television before.The textures and care that have gone into producing visuals are really remarkable in that they combine a faintly Japanese theme with the very deliberate pacing of a Kurosawa film. For a somewhat violent action cartoon, there is a lot of silence: long stretches in which there is no dialog. The violence is stylized, the characters are fresh. In the series, episodes have developed strong moral themes (including morally ambiguous themes), pastiched various film styles, and all this while wildly entertaining any four year olds hanging around the house.The premiere movie sets the stage for all this and contains slight more dialog, on average, than most episodes. Still, it is amazing to watch. A revelation if you've not seen SJ before. Here's a disk you've got to own."
4,Fine,I like this backpack i just got it and it seems spacious enough for my needs my only problem is that the zipper of the packets go down really far which can make it hard to zip back up or stuff may fall out like on the tiny side pocket.
5,Great for 2 year olds,"This product runs on my computer. My hyper 2 year old loves the animation, and will sit still to watch. My 7 year old likes it too, and wants to sit with him. He likes to use the mouse, and be his little brother's teacher. It works great for beginners, and grabs their attention."
5,Still going after 14 years,"I bought this software for my 1st son 14 years ago, and now my 2 year old is loving it too! Some parts seem kind of corny, yet he eats it up!!"
3,"OK, not great for my little guy","I bought this as a replacement to a similiar item that we scratched. The product doesn't hold my son's attention as other items. It's a good product, just not as I thought it would be. Variety of games and skills to learn are good."
3,Original Tubby the Tuba Animation,"This is a fun video ahead of its time--1946--though it's not up to modern technology. The feature is the best of a few cartoons on the video, a little better than the 2nd one. But for pre-schoolers, it's wonderful for its wide-eyed and creative characters, as well as its music--a wonderful melody that becomes ""Tubby's tune.""."
2,False advertising,"There are only two matches on the DVD, and neither is the promised tagteam match. Even worse, the video quality is extremely poor, as the image pixellates when you freeze frame it."
1,Unable to even get Unlock Key!!!,Great price but unable to get unlock key as software is so old. Nice chart to look at on my laptop but cannot put on GPS without unlock key. Spent 2 days with magellan on phone... no dice...guess i'll chalk this purchase up as a loss and buy a new handheld GPS.
1,BOGUS CD. NOT ORGINAL,The cd is obviously not real. I used to own the exact same cd and it was completely different. The cover was printed on a cheap printer. DON'T GET SUCKERED LIKE I DID!
5,A very new side of Christina!,This cd is a whole new side of Christina with songs like Merry Christmas Baby and These are the special times.Although some songs like This Year are still the genie singing!Christmas Time was very unusual!Starting off with fala la la la ang going into a pop/r&b beat.She actually does a little rap part in here.I really think she should have just made her next album instead of making this because it doesn't even seem like a christmas cd to tell you the truth though.Well I have had my say.All in All go buy it kids and adults.It is worth it.As for those screaming comments.NO.She isn't screaming she is vocalizing and well I might add.
4,Pretty good,"This is a nice Christmas album. You can really see the beautiful voice she has (she's better than any Jessica, Britney, or Mandy out there). She has that 5 vocal range that Mariah has (or that's what I think... she can hit those really high notes like Mariah can).I liked all of the songs she sang. She sang them all well and I really enjoyed listening to them. I wished she could sing with more feeling though.Have A Merry Little Christmas is one of the most beautiful songs on this album. Her voice is full of feeling and it is such a pretty song!Lots of the songs on this album is tinged with a gospel sound. Sometimes at a end of a song you can hear a choir and it turned into gospel and soul. I love this! It gives the songs their own unique flavor.This album is really good. Get it!"
3,Somewhat dissapointed,"I love Christina and was really expecting to see a steller Christmas album. Too many uptempos, not enough good Christmas goodness. If you want a really excellent Christmas pop album buy Mariah Carey's Merry Christmas"
2,Okay,"I was disappointed with this Christmas album. Christina Aguilera has such a beautiful and powerful voice, but she messed up so many songs by doing and endless amount of runs/malissmas. Usually it's very good for vocalists to show off their talents, but Christina Aguilera took it to a point with this album where it just became annoying. You could not sing along with any of the traditional Christmas tunes because Christina was all over the board while singing them. I just wish that she would have just used her great voice to just sing instead of trying to blow everyone way with how many malissmas she can create. We all know she's a good singer, but in this case, she didn't sound good at all."
1,Did not Like,"I was really anticipating listening to this CD when I ordered it. I love Christina's voice and I thought that this would be a great addition to my Christmas collection. It fell short of my expectations. She sings traditional Christmas music but it almost feels ""choppy"". She adds extra ""la, la, la"" sounds throughout, which wouldn't be that bad, but it feels like an interruption to the music. She also adds a lot to the lyrics. For example, during ""O Holy Night"", she recites the Lord's Prayer. I did not care for such additions to the music. It is her interpretation of the songs and I guess I just did not care for that interpretation."
1,Exceptionally Bad,"I really hate most Xmas albums, I think that they are responsible for alot of the holiday mayhem and murders. But this CD is remarkably awful. I have to be honest, I did not listen to the entire CD, it probably would have killed me! This ""artist's"" meager singing ability coupled with Xmas-themed material makes for a very unpleasant experience. To quote one reviewer: ""You go girl!"". Yes, please go, now."
2,"she should be in the movie "" scream""","She should have been in the movie "" Scream"" since she love to scream so much in every songs. i mean , if you really want to scream, at least do it like Mariah carey. this album is good but too much of Christina showing off. Mariah Carey's christmas album is WAY much better"
1,Ruins the Joy Of Christmas Songs,"In the spirit of POP singers exploiting Christmas, we now may add Christina Aguilera to this list. Once again, she sacrifices great songs to play vocal gymnastics. She ruins such great songs as ""Silent Night"" by running through the lyrics just to jump up and down her vocal chords. This CD is not very good. It is best to buy the old Christmas CD's like Nate King Cole or Hank Williams. If you like Christmas songs being yelled into your ears, then this is the CD for you. If you're not a fan of hers, then don't buy it cause you won't like it. Christina should have left this CD in the bottle. This CD is up there with other great popstars Christmas CD's like N Sync and 98 Degrees. They just shouldn't make Holiday CD's."
2,"Some Songs were pretty good, others were simply ruined.","Christina Aguilera has a beautiful voice, one of the most talented ones I've ever heard. Have a Merry Little Christmas sounded very nice. It had an Aguilera touch to it and yet still kept the base song. But 'O Holy Night' was terrible. I've never heard a song sound that bad. When she should have belted it, she whispered it, when she should have whispered it, she belted it. O Holy Night was disastrous. BUT the other songs weren't too bad on the ears."
4,I would love a new XMAS CD,"When this CD came out it was perfect. The uptempo beats, all of the childish themes were just great. But now Christina and her fans have grown and matured. Don't get me wrong i still love this CD and it is in my xmas rotation along with Jessica and Mariah, but I would love it if she released another xmas CD, it could be called, ""My OTHER-kind of christmas"" and she could even do some of the same songs, but more classics, and just her and like a harp and piano, and ofcourse on some of the bigger songs a full orchestra, I wish she did one that wasn't so teen-pop(Not thats there anything wrong with that) like her rendtion of Silent Night on ""Platinum Christmas"" that was amazing. The first one will do but I am praying that she records another one."
3,Nice cover picture!,"Nice voice, terrible picture for the holiday season. You're not supposed to look like a porn star at Christmas."
2,NOT My Kind of Christmas at all,"First off, let me say that I am a HUGE fan of Christina Aguilera and I think that she has one of the best voices of the last few years but I can't lie to yall and say that this album is good. It ain't. Point blank. Of course the album has its high points (Angels We Have Heard On High, Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas, The Christmas Song, and These Are Special Times) but these moments are few and far between.The main problem is that between her recording her album ""Mi Reflejo"" and this one she somehow forgot how to ""sing"". Instead of singing she just yells at the top of her lungs and never holds a note longer than 3 seconds before she begins riffing uncontrollably. I don't want to go any further because, like I said, I am a HUGE fan of Ms. Aguilera so I KNOW she can do better.I recommend this to FANS ONLY. If you're just looking for a good Christmas album I would suggest you go with ""Merry Christmas"" by Mariah Carey instead."
3,Good effort but needs to be toned down,"Christina has a beautiful voice and an impressive range. She has more staying power than Britney, who has a voice lacking so many things. The only problem is that Christina overdoes it by hitting high notes too many times, unnecessarily, in a single song. She just needs to tone it down and realize less is more."
1,Just another bad christmas cd,"Why is it that every popular artist feels that he or she must come out with a christmas cd? Mariah Carey, NSYNC, and many others simply detroy the wonderful music of this holiday. Christina only adds to this list. Christmas is not about pop music. My Kind of Christmas is an awful example of what people do to christmas. She should just stay with her regular pop sound. This sound doesn't work for the holiday season. If you're in need of a christmas cd, pick up the 98 degrees' holiday album. It's great because they don't change the beautiful songs of christmas. 98 degrees are the exception to these other popular artists. They sing the holiday classics the way they were meant to be sung. Christina doesn't, and the result is My Kind of Christmas."
1,Butchered Kind of Christmas,"THis has to be the first CHristmas album which won't put anyone in the Christmas spirit. If this is Christina's kind of CHristmas, I want no part in it. Christmas is supposed to be about nice, warm, cozy feelings, which she butchers with her vocal over-emoting, Mariah-Carey screeching, and over-extending of syllables in every possible part of a song (and in some impossible parts too). Unfortunately from everything I have seen, this is her trend, so I am sure her next English album will be as heavy as a 10-ton brick because of her oversinging. Christina, ever heard of the saying ""Less is more""? You haven't have you?"
5,Excellent Choice for Christmas,I originaly bought this cd becasue I was a Christina fan but I realized that this is an ideal choice for all fans of an assortment of different types of music. It has a few of her own new christams songs as well as some traditional christmas carols. It makes a perfect gift for all ages.
3,Unusually compelling,"My sister harangued me until I bought this cd and, at first, I really didn't think much of it. I dug out my Rufus Wainright cds and listened to them, instead (I didn't know he was on the cd, but the music reminded me of his). But then ""I hope someone"" caught me and I've been a gonner, ever since.I don't adore it and I have yet to play it for friends but, on a certain evening, when I'm in a certain kind of mood this - and a glass of wine- helps me relax on my deck while I look at the moon.That in itself is remarkable."
1,Not My Cup of Tea,"I tryed very hard to enjoy this music, since the reviews were all speaking highly of Antony and the Johnsons. But I just couldnt appreciate the friggin' ""WARBLE"" in his voice. No offense to anyone but it will forever remind me of a goat, and that bothers me. But other than that, this album would have been beautiful."
4,"A great voice, unusual",I had been recommended this singer and the music by family abroad. It came up to the glowing reports they gave of it. Thanks!
3,Golden Tee,"Since I never played the arcade version, I have no means for comparison. However this game is fun to play. I must say that the putting is way too easy... (When you can continually sink 43-65 ft shots on the green, there is something wrong). Overall, the controls are fairly easy to learn and the graphics are good. I'd recommend this game to someone who wants to play fun courses and always likes shooting -9 in 18 holes of play. If this isn't you, there are better more/challenging games out there. I'd suggest renting those before investing in this game."
3,Mystics and Zen Masters-a review,"Thomas Merton researched this book thoroughly by pouring through obscure and not-so-obscure texts in many classifications and countries. The book is a tracing of the development of each of the religions throughout their known records, with comparisons to major ideologies. English and Russian Mystics are delved into, as well as religion in China, early Buddhism, the Tao and the Jesuit's presence there. Christianity's high points are scanned. Monasticism is explored in both Protestantism and Zen Buddhism. Although it reads like a PhD. dissertation, Mystics and Zen Masters comes to some valuable conclusions about the evolution and the future to come of some of our world religions."
2,What Happened,"I am a big three 6 mafia fan, but since the release of "" The 2 Walk"" I had to think about it. They dont sound like them at all this cd was so horrable. I think i see what they are doing. I think they want new fan based people, but they dont relized that they are losing there old fans"
2,Boring!!!,"This album is BORING!!! no memorable songs, i was really dissapointed after I purchased this album. Nothing is special about any of these songs, just pathetic."
5,still waiting,"Due to some errors at the Amazon end I received the wrong book instead of ""Surprised by Suffering"" I returned it with a note of explanation and am still waiting to receive the book I ordered. The book I ordered was to be a birthday gift for someone. Alas that date has long since passed-maybe I can give it to him next year."
1,Heavily biased against Palestine,"There is good information here, unfortunately it only presents one side of the story. Israel is also guilty of a lot of problems that do not even get a mention here. There are two sides to every story, and this biased book does not accomplish covering both."
4,Pretty good book!,"Contrary to the rubbish that a lot of people are putting up in the review section, this book does a reasonably good job of explaining the Palestinian/Israeli conflict. It is concise, lucid and I don't really detect any considerable bias.There's always going to be crazy hardliners who nitpick and have huge amounts of time to write scathing reviews of books that attempt to present the truth as it really is, and not the convoluted, one sided account/myth drawn up by AIPAC and other pro-Israel organisations.I really recommend the book."
4,Excellent! Mood-setting. Nice mix of old and new sounds.,This is the perfect CD for an early evening after work with a fire and a glass of wine. It will soothe you and take you away from your worries.
4,"SMOOOOOTH, BABY","Wanting is not just the title track of this CD, but the theme. Her languorous cover of ""Girl From Ipenema,"" a great duet with Eric Benet ""Forever"", the silky ""Just An Hour""--all reverberate with a sexy longing. Good smooth jazz back-ups by, among others, Kirk Whalum on sax, Gregg Karukas on keyboards, Luis Conte on percussion. And Anders, who wrote many of the songs, has a slightly exotic, dreamy sound that wavers between soothing you like a lullaby and calling to you like a siren, making this a good CD for either relaxing or for a romantic evening."
2,Haunting...yet unrealistic,"This is one of those books that holds the reader under the impression something is going to happen...but just ends anti climactic and brings huge disappointment. The author makes the reader feel like an outsider thus unable to relate to the characters. I felt this was just a bizarre story one might see on a sleazy news magazine..and never really care about. It had great potential, but it was disappointingly uninteresting."
2,"""The Big Picture""","I found ""Hula,"" by Lisa Shea, an extremely easy book to read; however I missed the ""big picture."" I felt that there was really no point to the story, other than outlining the life of two sisters during their intense, and somewhat chaotic childhood. One thing that I did like, was how Shea displays and deploys a very descriptive writing style that I had never seen before in a novel. The writing is similar to something like detailed poetry, that's to the point; however due to the depictive nature, some of this could be offensive or disturbing to the readers in certain scenes, such as the sexual ones and scenes with the girls' father. I can appreciate the book for the way and style it was written in. But overall, like I said, ""Hula"" was just to me, nothing more than an easy read that was definitely lacking substance."
2,A disappointing look at childhood,"There are any number of excellent books in print that deal with childhood, with the author having a fine voice in terms of that of a child. In HULA, while Lisa Shea captures a child's voice with excellence, there is just no point to this book in the end. Rather, it is just a descriptive piece, and the reader learns nothing more from having read this book.I think Shea is big on style and short on substance. I found this book simply a display of Shea's writing skills, rather than anything monumental. There are so many fantastic books about childhood, such as LIAR'S CLUB and THE MONKEY KING (Patricia Chao) that this little book did nothing at all for me."
4,"Hula is Great...but where ARE you, Lisa Shea?","I read Hula a few years ago, and I was looking around on Amazon to see if Shea had written anything else. Hula was such a great read that I want more from this twisted, talented author. Shea captures the story in small moments rather than lengthy, descriptive prose. The characters, especially the father (an incredibly disturbed man suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) are sometimes difficult to understand, because Shea leaves enough to the imagination to make you wonder...this is a great book for people who do not need their literature spoon-fed to them."
2,Covers many topics but not detail enough,"My disappointment may be caused by I expecting too many. The unarmed combat sessions covers only kid karate class. The mentioned ""key strike points"" are not secret in Chinese martial art, it is a basic knowledge. I learned Chinese martial art for several years, and I do believe my teacher teached me more than this book in the first year.For the armed section, it is much better, but discussion is not deep enough. I expect more!"
2,Keypad failure,"Generally, a good cordless phone with easy-to-setup and use features; however, keypad failed in one year nearly to the day of purchase. Have returned phone to VTech for new one and waiting for their response."
4,Satisfaction guaranteed,"The song ""Satisfaction"", although inserted in the movie as a mood breaker with the appropriate comedic push, is an allegory of the movie itself. Lanie's life, like the bus drivers, & like the song itself, is a constant search for perfection, acceptance, belonginess & happiness. Not necessarily in that order. Nor is there any certainty that you can achieve this combination to attain a ""perfect life"".Despite the film's lack of ingenuity it is still something worth watching, not only because of its entertainment value but most importantly because of the message it is trying to convey to the viewers. For all it's worth, I recommend this movie to everyone.""satisfaction guaranteed""."
4,very good supplementary math book,This is an excellent math workbook. The basic concepts necessary for understanding fractions are clearly presented and practice sheets are provided.
3,Heartwarming Dramedy,"A well-written mix of comedy and drama, this is a tenderly, yet at times brutally honestly told tale of two older women whose well-meaning daughters set them up in a condo in Las Vegas. These women, Tess and Fannie, who think life has passed them by, both fall in love with the charming swindler Johnny Paolucci, and they realize that they are still capable of love, passion, and recreating themselves. Funny, touching, sometimes delightfully raunchy play with wonderful character parts. 2f (over 60), 2f (30s/40s), 1m (40s/50s), 1m (over 60)."
3,not much jingle,"This is a great hip scarf except in one respect- arguably the most important. It does not make a lot of noise. I have ordered two others from Amazon, one from the same company- both have silvertone coins and both have much more jingle to them. For looks, this one is just fine."
4,Epic by any measure,"By any measure this is an epic book, and showcases Sir Samuel Dill's prodigious ability to write about the topic he loved best, the late Roman Empire. The ebook edition adds an excellent introduction that sets the text in the context of more modern research, and gently points out areas where Dill's Victorian sensibilities may have gotten in the way of his scholarship. Nevertheless, this remains a very important work when studying the gradual conversion of Roman society from paganism to Christianity, and it's great to see it preserved so well in ebook form."
1,Problem,"I have tried to install it onto my computer and the game does not work at all. Even though I have installed the game, it wants me to install it over. Its a repeating pattern that wont allow to play my game. I suggest not buying this game."
1,Intel Macs Beware,"If you have a new Mac, don't bother wasting your time, because it won't run on OS X Leopard. And of course, there's no patch, so seriously, do not waste your time or money"
5,Wonderfully Hilarious,"The cartoons are what you would expect from the New Yorker: pithy and full of wit. The subjects themselves capture what we must think, albeit anthropomorphically, that cats see and contemplate when they view us or act around humans. It is all so believable, in a sardonic way, and because of that truly wonderful."
4,For advanced players,"This is just meant as a short comment, not a review..The video does not carry traits of the typical _instructional_ video. It's more talking about guitar and different solutions in jazz. Although everybody can learn something from it, I think it'll suit advanced players the best! It's a good video, but not excactly what I was looking for in an instructional dvd..!"
2,"Mildly entertaining, poorly written mystery.","As someone who works in Boston, I really enjoyed the setting of Peale's book. Also, the character of Addington Ames and his sister Carolyn are fairly well drawn. It is too bad then that the mystery itself isn't more intriguing or the writing better conceived. Although Peale has clearly done some research on 1890s Boston Brahmin social and city life, it almost seems as if she never completely integrated the information into the mystery, making it little more than just a superficial, guided tour of Victorian Boston. The writing was frequently awkward and some of the dialogue jarring. Also, there are many scenes where the POV shifts from one character to the next; something that I have been told by a writing instructor is a definite ""no-no"" in fiction writing. All in all, I really did want to like this book and it is still diverting enough to be read quickly. However, it does seem to me that it could have been a lot better."
2,Not a good introduction to Rice,"My first Rice book. The writing style, character development, and idea were so impressive that it had the pontential to join the list of books I consider masterful. I was majorly let down by two shortcomings. The first was the length of the documentary-style writing. The history was great but it became tedious when presented in documentary form for extended time. The other thing, and it's hard to explain without spoiling anything, was the ending. The ending isn't satisfactory because it leads into the next book, but the next book seems to be an entirely different type of tale - a type I find too 'way out' for my liking. Shame."
4,Absorbing story,"Pretty fanciful, but a good read. So good that I am going on to read Lasher and looking forward to Taltos, the next books in the series. One thing I would have liked would have been a diagram of the 'family tree' - it gets pretty convoluted. But that, in itself, is an integral part of the story."
4,I wish I was a Witch!,"This book sent shivers up my spine! I loved reading of the glamourous lives of the Mayfair witches. Anne Rice has such a wonderful imagination. THere wasn't anything dull about this book. Even though you know you are reading a book about witches, in some way, they are portrayed as real people. After reading this book, you will forever be connected to Anne Rice and her novels."
1,How did Rice ever become popular?,"Out of all of Rice's books that I have read, only one was actually worth the time (that one being INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE). Everything else of her's that I have read, including WITCHING HOUR, is just total trash. Like the last few books of hers I tried to read (including the rest of the vampire Chronicles after the third book), I was unable to finish this piece of garbage. The worst part of not finishing this one is that I was reading it for a class, and I am to be tested on it. Too bad the book wasn;t good enough to actually finish."
3,One of two books I've hurled across the room,"I have really enjoyed Ann Rice's Vampire Chronicles and Ramses...but this series will not be on my list of favorites.The description of life in New Orleans was pricesless.The book had very interesting characters, both in the current plot and the background, geneological history plot. The two main characters in the ""current plot"" could have been more central to the ""current plot.""The climax seemed so juvenile, especially compared to the style of the first 90% of the book. The ending so disappointed me that I sold the second book without reading it.I was in graduate school while reading Witching Hour. I took much longer than usual since I was so busy. The ending left me feeling as though I wasted my time."
5,AWESOME READING!,"Anne Rice if you are reading this, please come out with the sequel to Taltos. I read The Witching Hour, Lasher and Taltos about 4 years ago and I can't let go of the family. Please consider! You owe it to your loyal readers... Don't leave us hanging like this."
5,One of the best books ever,"I bought this book in papaerback more than 10 years ago, and I read and re-read it so often I had to by a hard-cover version.I usually read it once or twice a year. I love eevrything about this book, especially the witches'history. Very nice book, it's in my top-20 books."
4,A great read for a long trip...,"This was the first book of Ann Rice that I had read and it was excellent. It is a great book. I did like the fact that it was on the long side ( mainly because I love to read). It was so wonderfully written that there were times when I wondered about whether there was any truth in the Mayfair history. It is easy to become engrossed in the lives of the 13 witches. I will admit, though, there are some slow times; but for the most part, it is an exciting book."
1,Where are these five star reviews coming from?,"This is the worst book I have ever read. Reading it from one end to the other becomes a quest. The whole time, you will repeat to yourself, ""she's leading up to something, she's leading up to something..."" but she's not. There is no point to this book! Look at the majority of five star reviews, even they complain about the ending of this book. Watching paint flake or metal rust is more compelling."
4,Intriguing read but long in parts,"I love series so I was thrilled that this set had three long books. I don't like the story to end. This book is set in the present but has some rather lengthy ""history"", almost a geneology of the Mayfair family. I found most of that stuff rather boring and skimmed through most of it. The modern day part of the story is very intriguing once you get through the history."
4,Some Nazi propaganda inside,"The Witching Hour is a master piece. No doubt about it, I even presented it to someone I care. The supernatural story is so well written and so rich that you can't take your eyes off the 1000 pages book. But it has some genetic purism that sounds like nazism and becomes more clear in the second book - Lasher. Anyway it not waste of time read it, I would read it again."
1,tedious,My title says it all ...the most tedious and uninteresting book i have ever had the displeasure to pick up and i loved rices vampire books.
2,Reading this book seemed like work.,I found this book to be very frustrating. I felt like I was in a rat maze at times. The ending really stinks. Would have rather spent time washing socks.
3,Decent book,"The beginning was good enough to hook me, however, I became bored to tears around the middle and had a hard time getting back into this book."
2,The Witching Hour by Anne Rice,"Like some other reviews, I was anxious to read this book and it took me several tries before I got into it. I think it was due to the size of the book, with my Kindle you just kept going. It was a great read in the beginning and I couldn`t wait to see what happened, but then we got into all the names of relatives, where they lived, etc. ( a geneology tree would have helped...maybe in the back of the book ) However toward the end it got really goofy. Conversations with Lasher, affairs with Lasher, Baby with Lasher....or rather Lasher as baby (sorry, don`t mean to spoil it) It turned into a wichcraft version of ""Alien"" Half way through I thought ""I can`t wait to read ""Lasher""--but after toiling through the end of this one, I need a vacation....maybe another time!!"
4,fascinating...,"This book was kind of hard to get into at first, but it's worth sticking it out! The story of the Mayfair witches is woven with a rich history rooted in the southern city of New Orleans. Anne Rice has created a fascinating geneology that provides the background for the plot - in fact, my favorite part of the entire book is the middle section, which is the Talamasca's (remember them from the Vampire books?) records and history of the Mayfair family and their ties to the mysterious being known as Lasher. The characters were well-developed and their relationships completely enthralling. The cliffhanger ending made me run out and buy the next two books in the trilogy. They were okay, but I didn't enjoy them half as much as this first one. Definifely recommended."
3,"Good, but slow.....","I enjoyed this book, but it's rather slow reading. i found that i could sit and read and i'd feel like I'd read like half an hour's worth of information, but I'd been reading for 2 hours. It's a really good book, though."
4,A Gothic Epic~,"The Witching Hour is about generations of the Mayfair witches and was my first Anne Rice novel. I loved the descriptions of New Orleans and the in-depth characters. I found that some details were overly written, and the book too long (over 1000 pages)leading the story into the second book 'Lasher'. It was an entertaining but slow read. I wanted more action and then finally to be done with the book about 3/4 of the way through. I don't feel compelled to read the next installment."
5,"Excellent, Excellent writer who has done it yet again!",Anne Rice writes in a unique way that allows the reader to feel they are there - her writing grabs you and doesn't let you go. Get to know this Mayfair family and their tale - you wont' be disappointed.
1,Cabins and Castles,"When I purchased this book, I thought it would be about Montgomery County Tennessee. Not knowing the author, (and there are two books with similar titles, I chose this one. But what a surprise, it is a book of poems. The book I wanted was by Eleanor S. Williams not Luther R. Johnson (after some research.) This is why I wish the seller would give detail on the contents of the book as well as condition.Very disappointed"
5,Earnie Haase & Signature Sound,"Earnie Haase and Signature Sound are one of my top 5 favorites of gospel music. I love their energy, their harmony. This particular DVD is one that I will watch over and over again."
5,Delightful Read,"You will never be disappointed with a Georgette Heyer novel. The conversations between her characters are brilliant. You discover almost everything by how they address each other! She also has the most uniquely named people in her books.The way both characters in this book mature and evolve is wonderful. Sherry (Lord Sherington) calls Hero (his wife) ""Kitten"" and indeed he treats her like a pampered pet. But trouble brews for these newlyweds with gambling and other mischief afoot. Both main characters have a long way to go before becoming proper! The journey will keep you interested beginning to end with all the other characters just as interesting and amusing.Superb romance with substance."
4,"Excellent book, but Cotillion is better","I won't go through a general review of this book, except to say that although it is a great book, I preferred Cotillion. The story lines are very similar, but I found the hero in Cotillion (Freddy) more likeable than the hero in Friday's Child (Sherry). Also, you get to see more of Freddy's falling in love than you do of Sherry's."
5,Laugh Out Loud Hilarious Dialogue,"This is my 15th Heyer book. I have been reading one a day since I discovered this writer. I have never paused in the Romance section of the library or book stores, so I have lived a rather long life without the great entertainment Georgette Heyer provided the world with her books. This particular one does not fall into her Regency Romance formula as it is far more Wodehouse - with great young male characters and their very humorous dialogue. Laughter is good medicine, I think. The world was in turmoil when this one was published in 1944, so I am impressed with Heyer's ability to have created these wacky characters. If you need a laugh, try this one for the zany dialogue."
5,The touch of my heart,"Theres only one song on here that touches my heart and that is ""Waiting for a star to fall"" by Boy meets world. When i first heard this song i couldnt believe my hears, it was so beautiful and thats when it touch my heart. I love this song so much i can play it over and over like a 1,000 times a day. Sometimes i cry cause it sounds so great when its in my heart and mind."
4,Episode Guide,"I thought it would be helpful to let people knowwhat order to watch the series.-----------------""Roughnecks Starship Troopers Chronicles: The Pluto Campaign"". Released: 03/13/01First story arc, episodes 1~5.-----------------""Roughnecks Starship Troopers Chronicles: Hydora"".

1,NOT WORTH THE COST,"DELTA DID NOT LIVE UP TO THEIR NAME AND QUALITY REPUTATION WITH THIS PRODUCT. IT IS CONSTRUCTED OF CHEAP PLASTIC AND ""JUMPS"" OUT OF THE CONTAINER WHEN USED. WE ARE DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS ITEM."
3,"nice, low profile, but too long to fill","nice slick low profile design,but the opening on the bottle is way too small,and it took for ever to fill the small bottle it provides"
1,Binding Problems,"The content of this book is very good and I thoroughly enjoy the pieces in it. However, the pages fall out of this book very easily and it's poorly bound. I would not recommend the book for that reason."
3,Acid reflux has ruined my life :-(,"the book was very imformative about the disease itself. But I found the recipes not really to my liking, and I think it would have helped if they had some colour pictures of the food, that always inspires you to cook."
3,A good cookbook with a wrong recomendation.,I found this book to be fairly helpful. The recipies are ok with some helpful hints. One recomendation I feel should be included that has helped me beyond expectations is the use of a incline pillow called the Prop-Up Pillow (www.propuppillow.com). Anyone suffering from acid reflux should consider this pillow. It is made from NASA memory foam and is by far the most comfortable on the market. Eat right and use this pillow.
2,"GOOD COMPANY, DISAPPOINTING PRODUCT","This company sent me the wrong briefcase; it had only one compartment. Then it sent me the correct product, but it wasn't as big or as nice as the photograph made it seem. So I decided to stick with the Eagle Creek briefcase I was using before. This company was great, very fast and responsive. Totally honest. So I would recommend doing business with them."
2,No pizzaz!!,"Very weak strawberry flavor, good lubrication. You can do better try pipedreams liquid love in heart shaped 4oz. bottle much better flavor and warming (be sure to transfer pipedreams lube to another bottle as their caps frequently leak."
4,butterfly panties,"Quick delivery. Looks just like the picture. Beads started falling off with the first wearing though. Overall, I'm quite happy with the purchase."
1,Beating myself for buying this travesty of a film,"I have a enormous black movie collection and I have never seen an urban film so awful in all my life. The acting is bad, the plot is terrible, and the stereotype of the black male and female run rampant throughout this travesty of a film.This movie should of never been released to the viewing public. I have to say that this is an embarassment to urban films and I am throwing this movie away."
4,Better than the First Movie!!!,"The legendary Marvel superhero quartet is back to take on the strange extra-terrestrial being, The Silver Surfer and the return of their previous enemy, Dr. Doom, It's a fantastic sequel that outdoes the original, thrilling, spectacular, good humor, a blast!, I hope theres a third movie,"
4,silver surfer,"I'm glad i went to London before seeing this film. I went on the Londen eye and was staying in that exact area so it would have creeped me out if i saw this film before going to london. Anyway, this second Fantastic 4 was good. I liked the silver surfer and Torche's new ability to trade powers with the other members. Dr. Doom is back and still evil. There were funny moments and lines and overall, this film was fantastic, from start to end. Jessica alba and chris evans were my fav. of the four heroes and of course the silver surfer was cool as sin."
4,SUPERB Rendering of the Silver Surfer Character!,"Having read the first series of Silver Surfer comics, published by Marvel from 1968-1969, then picking up the series again in the late 1980s through the early 1990s, I have to say that it's great that the Surfer is finally getting the big-sreeen treatment he deserves.The special effects...outstanding! The way the Surfer's ""suit"" reflects his surroundings is well rendered. The character is enigmatic and has great screen presence.Don't heed the newspaper reviews; for example, the _Boston Globe_ reviewer panned this as ""unnecessary"" but of course did not mention the Surfer's transition from 2D comics to film (because he obviously never picked up the comic in his life).I DO have a question about this DVD version compared with the two-disc version (both to be released on October 2, 2007). What extras come with the two-disc versions?Thanks in advance for any helpful comments."
1,Multi-million dollar bad tv episode,"Easily the worst movie I've seen this year, maybe this decade, definitely the worst comicbook movie since Batman & Robin. The cliches come so fast and furious that my wife and I were predicting the next lines with terrible accuracy. The dialogue, direction and acting are on the level of a bad tv episode of a bad soap opera. I know that's part of the fundamental F4 concept, but it's as almost as badly handled here as the Adam West Batman TV show. No point in beating a dead horse - this is a stinker."
2,What did they do?,"One of the most convoluted plots ever documented, I fail to see what makes this small group of superheroes so special. This movie should have been named Torch-since he was the only one that did anything. Other than the silver surfer developing a crush and then doing, I know not to defeat the destroyer-I'm left shaking my head at this. I mean there are better plots and acting on the Scifi channel. Alba is still too painful to watch, but she does know how to just stand and look pretty. Please, please-say this is the end to the franchise"
4,Fantastic Four - Rise of the Silver Surfer,"The movie was good, but I wish it could have gone more into his rebellion and conflict with Galactus."
1,God awful movie. If it was not for all the special effects it would be one of those B movies in the clearance ben.,"I do not see how this could be considered a good movie. The story plot was bad and the characters were cheesy horrible. The jokes stunk. Obviously this movie was made for little kids to sell toy merchandising(SEE STUPID BEAR SEEN WHICH IS AN OLD CLICHE WHICH USUALLY INVOLVES A DOG AND SOMEONE GROWLS AT IT THEN IT RUNS SCARED, BAD BAD BAD). It is the worst super hero movie I have ever seen. The only cool part was the Silver Surfer character and his abilities. Lets hope they do not make a sequel. I wanted for the first time to smash a Blu Ray/DVD disk, I would have but I wasted money renting this junk."
4,Blu Surfer,"Saw this movie in the big screen but loved and enjoyed it even more in blu ray. Great blu ray transfer, both video & audio. Loved the chase scene between torch and the silver surfer, and of course, Ms. Alba. Worth paying extra for BD!"
4,The Cloud,Great movie. I'm a big fan of Julian (aka Cole for you Charmed lovers). He played a great Doctor Doom. Great Movie to sit back to and watch it with the kids. However...Galactus was a cloud. That was a HUGE disappointment. I was expecting a Huge omnipotent god like being to appear and eat the Earth rather I see a Huge cloud. Sad...very sad Marvel.Hopefully the Silver Surfer spinoff will show Galactus in his true form.
3,Fan of the Four,"I am a big fan of the Fantastic Four, and loved the first movie, flaws n' all. True...I thought the second fell short ( and given the first was not incredibly great) I waited to purchase it. But today, in this day in time..you can get a great copy from a reliable vendor for about five dollars...well worth it to add to your superhero movie collection."
3,"Enjoyable, not earth-shattering, haha","This was a good bit like the first one (I watched both on the same night for the first time). I enjoyed it, but I didn't feel the earth move under my feet or anything. I didn't look up to the sky to see what was happening, but this movie was, at least to me, fairly engrossing. It was an enjoyable watch for a couple hours, but I don't think I'd buy it at full price. This is, for me, a be entertained once every 3 or four years kind of movie. I was a little disappointed at how they depicted Galactus, but I can understand why they did it the way they did."
4,It is what it is,"I laugh at the reviews saying this is a bad movie. It is fun and my kids love it, and isn't that who it is made for??I went back to my old comics and re-read a few. Even on the cover it says it is the GOOFIEST COMIC IN THE WORLD. Funny to see so many people expect so much out of the movie when the source material is just for fun as well."
1,Fantastic Four:Rise of the Silver Surfer,"This is a great movie,But the copy you buy you cannot play on any dvd players as it needs a code & you don't get one with it.This very very bad copy will not play on any dvd players in Australia & you don't get a refund because you have opened it only to find that it will not play,plus you don't get a new one even when you write to the company to tell them the problem you are having with something thay have sold you & thay do not write back to see if thay can do any thing to fix the problem with any of there DVDS as I paid for 3 DVDS an none of them work.DON'T BUY DVDS FROM AMAZON YOU WILL BE SORRY YOU DID.Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver SurferOne Man's JusticeHighlander 3-the Sorcerer"
4,A Fantastic Flick,"For a sequel, this movie made the grade. If anything, this may have surpassed the original."
2,"Rent it, don't buy it.","The first movie was much better. This one was a waste. Story-line was boring, acting was worse."
3,SILVER ON THE RISE,"Let me state straight away, I much prefered this movie to the original film, this one is better paced and with a more creative story. The Dr. Doom character is the best thing about these films, he looks great and he is brutal menace just like in the comics. The Silver Surfer character is somewhat of an enigma, but I liked the CGI, and to honest he looked really HOT, but i digess..overall, a much improved sequel, but honestly, get Ms. Alba an acting coach, she is up there with Josh Hartlet as the worst actors in Hollywood, she is hot, yes for sure, but her character is important to the flow of the film and she's asked to do some emoting and she is just painful to watch..here's hoping the next film in even better and that Ms. Alba takes me advice."
3,"Okay, not great, not bad","There are many songs I love here on this cd, but just as many that I could have done without. Great for background music during the holidays."
1,A mess!,"I used a similar book 2 years ago and passed written exam with ease. Too bad I cannot find it because this book is a disaster. Lots of questions without explanations - like charts - answer key mistakes that conflict with their explanation, etc... The English expression section is not even in the same neighborhood as what the State Dept's own literature illustrates.There are other agency's in the government that have Foreign Service Officers, or their equivalent, with no test requirements, including Agriculture, USAID, Peace Corp, Commerce, etc... Also there are ways of converting from Civil Service to Foreign Service or coming on as a Specialist. These options are all worth looking into if this is where your interests are."
2,Teach Yourself Java (and other things),I really didn't find the book all that useful. The code explanations are not clear and his website used for reference is incomplete. You also have to supply your own gifs or jpegs to get his examples to work. But I guess you get what you pay for. Spend your money on something else.
3,They Make A Better Connector,"Nelson makes a connector that's exactly the same as this one, except that it has a plastic piece on each end that makes it much easier to attach to the hose, and a rubber holder piece on the female end that makes it a snap to connect and disconnect the hoses. At the time I'm writing this, Amazon only sells the bare brass set, which is much harder to use. If you can find the other type with the helpers on it, you'll be much happier (and I hope that I can find them too someday, at someplace other than our {mega lo mart})."
4,Very good for the price,"These are excellent for the weekend fixer. Using for excessive impact driving is probably no recommended. Aside form that, this is a good set."
5,The stuff you need,"I service three buildings and there are many different types of fasteners and repairs to be made this product has been great companion to the Milwakee screwgun.The extension is a blessing and have used this more than I tought I would. Well thought out, rugged case that stays closed tools are easy to get out yet stay in place."
3,Milwalkee drill bit set,Great price from Amazon. Nice box for storage...but one of the drill bits pulled out of its quick mount on its first use !!! Other than that so far so good
2,Poor Quality - Broken bits and a Quik-Lok which will not release a bit.,I have broken most of the drill bits. Often the first time the drill bit was used. The quik-lok will not release one of the driver bits making it useless.My hobby for the past eight years is woodworking. I try to buy the best tools I can afford so I do not have to replace then a year later. I have a number of other Milwaukee products and have been pleased with the performance and quality. However this bit set is junk.
5,Playing is the best,"From my favorite movie comes my favorite soundtrack. Unforgetable scenes such as Trent and Meredith's first kiss -- ""Lover's Will"" -- are captured perfectly. Buy it, blast it, and have a classically relaxing time!"
2,amagansett,"I'm not sure how this book received such high marks. I found it flat and boring. By the end, the only thing I cared about was when it was going to end. It's a very light read with no depth."
4,A Good Book,"The description of the setting was wonderful, the story engaging, the ending satisfying. I would recommend this book. Sometimes perhaps the descriptions slowed the story a bit, but not in any sense that I felt the need to skip through them or any exasperation for Mills to get on with it. While I read this over several days and didn't feel obligated to stay up into the wee hours, I found that once it was done, I missed it. Sometimes books that take a while to settle but settle deep are the best sort."
3,LONG ISLAND INTEREST,"Being from Long Island, I appreciated this book more for its local color than the story. It story started out in an interesting fashion, but the murder mystery got a little mundane. If you enjoy stories about The Hamptons and the rich, you will enjoy ""Amagansett""."
3,Reeves' Impressive Debut as the Man of Steel,"The first feature-length Superman movie was a 1951 science-fiction drama that served as the pilot for the classic TV series. Remarkably provocative in its depiction of mob violence and racial tolerance, ""Superman and the Mole Men"" rises above its low-budget shortcomings due to Robert Maxwell's timely script and Lee Sholem's no-nonsense direction. Best of all, the film marks George Reeves' debut as Superman/Clark Kent - an iconic portrayal that would dominate the remainder of his career. Co-star Phyllis Coates plays a refreshingly independent Lois Lane (a role she defined in the show's first season) while famed acting teacher Jeff Corey stands out as a gun-toting bigot. Extra Trivia: One of the subterranean ""Mole Men"" is an uncredited Billy Curtis."
3,"works, but.....","Well, the cord does what it is supposed to do. It plugs my ipod into my alpine deck. It charges my ipod and I am able to control the volume and skip songs from the deck as well as a couple other features. However, when your ipod is plugged in you can not access any of the features ON your ipod. It is a dark screen. So I can't use the toggle wheel to select albums or choose specific songs. Once it is plugged into the deck you can only use the deck to control the ipod. Which means you are relying on the decks limited display and control buttons. Other than that it's ok."
1,Alpine KCE-422i Broken/Loose connection,"Alpine KCE-422i iPod Connection Cable arrived quickly and in a plastic pouch. The cable connects somewhat loosely into my Ipod Video and wiggles around. The cable must be pushed upwards slightly to enable stereo output. When it is not being pushed up, only my right speakers work. Broken wire or bad connectors are my guess.I now have an Ipod with a rubber banded cord wrapped around it to supply constant pressure on the loose connection. Works, but for a simple connector that costs this much I would hope that it least worked all the time.Connector connects poorly. Perhaps shipping with better packaging would help.Would not suggest this item to a friend."
5,A beautiful addition to your home stereo,"Sony have once again created a reliable product. We have played this machine literally all through the night, and it performed wonderfully. A definately good buy. The best CD player I know of."
5,Healing Passion!,"Tomorrow's Promise is a classic love story. This book is the journey of two different women from totally different worlds that share one thing in common...they are broken! They find their souls and bodies healing from their growing passion for eachother but, will it be enough? Time will heal old wounds but, how much time do they have together? This book was romantic from start to finish and I couldn't be happier! It was an easy read and a complete pleasure as always a Rad book is! I will definitely keep this classic in my collection! You will not be disappointed..."
5,Great for any Offspring fan or music video lover!,"This DVD contains all of The Offspring's music videos including the new song, ""Can't Repeat"" and 2 Never Before Seen videos, with the option of having a commentary. It also has 11 Live Concert videos. A small documentary on ""Where is the ""Pretty For A White Guy"" Guy now? Plus three secret videos that you have to find....I would say that this is one of the best Music Video DVDs out there!"
4,Highly recommend!,"I was stuck after losing 25 lbs and needed to change up my workout. I ordered this to add to my workout...and it kicked my butt! I'm happy to say that I've lost an additional 20 lbs. and am now at my ideal weight. Can't beat the price or the results. I will say that the audio on the DVD has issues, but nothing wrong with the picture."
3,Not for the uncoordinated,"I don't know why I have so much trouble with the moves in this video. They seem so simple in the step guide, and Galardi introduces each move slowly, but still when she puts it all together, I have trouble keeping up. Maybe it's just me. Probably. I do like that it gets me feeling good about my body. I'm not into hip hop really, but the moves kind of make me feel sexy."
1,same old stuff,"If you've read ""Million Dollar Habits"", don't bother reading this. Most of the ideas and stories are straight from the other book. I've never before known an author to write a ""new"" book, and say the exact same thing as the old book. At least he changed the cover."
2,Adobe's suite promises but does not deliver.,"This is an over-priced product that helps little if your objective is to have a quality video editing suite. It is much better and convenient to buy aftereffects and premiere 5.1, independently."
4,excellent album,"This spaced out- chilled out album is one of my favorites. I have never run the DVD that sometimes comes with it (I don't have a DVD player) but the CD's are godhead. I'm a waiter and sometimes, when I get off of work at midnight, I go home, drop into bed and put on these albums. Furthermore, they make nice background music for intercourse. amen.One album is slow going pure chill and the other is a little more funky and trance like. Both feature female vocals and very spacey music."
1,New Age Nonsense,"Uncritical acceptance of any and all mystical beliefs, from astrology to homeopathy, bolstered with poor science and great leaps of faith. The speaker (tapes) starts with ""digital"" nerve conduction, through layer after layer of ""higher order"" ""energies"", ending with his example of projecting swirling light from his heart chakra to quiet unruly babies. Medically worthless, but could possibly give the listener some insight into how scant pseudoscience can be amplified into complex belief systems by True Believers."
1,Not Happy,"Purchase these for my daughters, comparing these to the one I purchase for my wife at the local jewelery store (not paying much more than this one) they seem like costume crap, even the feel seems cheap....and so close to xmas it's hard to exchange now..even bought a number of charms for the both of them....I remember getting my kids fake jewelery out of the vending machines that look about the same...sorry but would not buy again...NO WAY"
5,thanks,i got this book wellive loved story of Jim Elliot's life so i gift it for my deari makes me remember the Lord in my life
3,Muscle:Confessions of an unlikely bodybuilder,"Muscle is a great tale of an obsession and I enjoyed this book. However it didn't quite live up to my expectations. I felt that Fussell didn't take us to the dark places that I was sure he visited on his journey to get big. He didn't really delve into to what he was scared of, it had to be more than scary New York in the 1980s. You were left to guess where this fear came from, was he bullied as a teenager. It was hard to like Fussell, he turns from a wimp to a bully in the first 30 pages. I think it would be hard to like any body builders if you weren't in that club. They are exclusive and isolated and it is ironic that this is what the book is about but a fact that also reduces access to the outsider."
3,"My Life As An ""ALSO RAN...""","I am not a competitive bodybuilder... or even a ""big guy"", but I do work out religiously. To me, Sam Fussell exhibits the character of any ""addict"", in his case it was an addiction to a quest for physical size. I am sure that much of what he says is true, but felt that he has embellished the arena of pro bodybuilding with an overall unsavory tone. The story might be the same, but would sound much different coming from a successful bodybuilder. I can only assume that Sam's self doubts, and the emotional pressure created by the alienation of his family, led him to slide back into his pre-ordained life as another Prof. Milketeoast. Sam is not an Arnold Schwarzenegger or Lee Hainey precisely because he does not have what it takes. His book is an effort to reconcile his failure. Still, it is interesting reading but it should be remembered that the story is told through the jaundiced eye of an ""also ran"" who gave up and refused to admit that he didn't have what it takes."
5,For those who don't know there was once a 23 year old Wilson,"Heard the album before using the internet to find out who this guy was and what he had done. Have read none of the other reviews as of writing this. What I see here is a guy in his sixties with a voice that can communicate lyrics but is not what one would call a good one. The band does a fine job with instrumental and vocal accompaniment. There is little talk and no electronic fireworks: just a variety of songs in different moods and tempos. Taking it for what it is and not what it might have been forty years before, I rate it as quite enjoyable, a good evening's entertainment...particularly because Wilson let me hear the lyrics. I doubt if anyone will think of this as a thrilling experience; definitely it is easy listening."
3,not in the original key,"One important element of appreciation of the Pet Sounds shows is that the original keys were not used, in order to allow Brian to sing everything himself.For example, ""Wouldn't it be nice"" is in D instead of the original F.This makes the music sound flat; the tension that you could feel in the original recording is no longer there. High voices are too much a trademark of the Beach Boys music to let it slip way: ok, Brian lost his falsetto, but maybe he could leave the lead vocals to someone else from time to time."
5,A new hero in the 3D World,"Worth every penny. Mark's photos are one of the few ways to appreciate the underwater and terrestrial landscape as close to real life as possible, without the hassles of separate glasses.I felt I was back underwater with Mark's book. If these images moved, it would be more thrilling!"
5,Hilarious book!,"This is the first book in a series of four about a girl, named Rilla, who recieves a mysterious present in the mail announcing that someone has bought her a year-long subscription to the Monster of the Month Club. Every month she recieves a new monster in the mail. No one ever told her that the monsters would be live ones! Each monster comes complete with feeding instructions and strange warnings that must be heeded, or else . . .These are extremely funny books that will keep you laughing till the very end. As a Librarian, I recommend this book all the time to children (and adults) and they love it."
2,This program is really not worth the money.,"This is a very clunky, very limited piece of software. It converts files to mp3's from pretty much any other format. But that's it. You can't edit your sound files. You can't turn mp3's into other file formats (except .wav - but you can get freeware programs that do that). The CD writing options are limited. The only good point is that the interface is spiffy-looking.But the thing that makes me mad enough to get online and write a review is this: it won't let me completely fill my CDs. I can only use, say, 70 minutes out of an 80-minute CD or it will give me an error message. Or it will only allow me to write maybe 18 files to the disk, even if I have space left. I am very disappointed in this program and am kicking myself for buying it."
1,Do not buy this Watch,I bought this watch in Dec 2003 when it first came out. Within one year the case started to corrode. The corrosion got so bad that the case is now cutting into my skin. I called Timex Customer Service and was told that the case is iron not stainless steel and that happens due body sweat. Bottom line the watch is only good for two years.
3,"Good, with one big flaw","At first I was really happy with this watch. It's attractive, quiet (contrary to some of the other reviews here, I personally found this to be one of the quieter-ticking watches I've owned) and durable.However, one thing ended up killing this for me: The numbers and dial are extremely reflective. Depending on the angle and intensity of the light sources around you, the dial and numbers can be rendered effectively invisible. I found sunlight and stage lighting to be particularly bothersome in this regard. It got so bad that I had to give up using this watch at all. For a watch that advertises easy-reading as one of its key features, I find the decision to use reflective numbers perplexing, to say the least. I ended up replacing it with the Timex Men's T2M453 T . Very similar design with a perpetual calendar, but with nice plain white numbers that remain visible in all lighting conditions."
2,too wordy,I am a preschool teacher and the finger plays in this book are too long and wordy. The illustrations were not very easy to follow either.
5,I am the terminator,It's a DMX terminator. Plug it in the output of the last intelligent light in your set and that's it. Works as advertised.
3,Not The Best But Not Bad,"Nazi gold, British, Russian, American spy's and various crooks are the ingredients of this 1981 novel.It's all pretty run of the mill stuff from Mr. Deighton who can be bit ""hot and cold"" with his spy stories.Set in the 1970's we have several organizations looking for the ""Hitler Minutes"", documents that could be very embarrassing for Britain especially and tarnish the reputation of Winston Churchill forever.There are the usual double crosses and machinations from the intelligence services that make the task of our hero, Stuart Boyd, next to impossible in solving the job put before him.Unfortunately the story ends very limply. It is as if even the author got a bit bored and wanted to move onto something else.So, not one of Deighton's best, but he has written some wonderful stories as well so don't ever be put off his work."
2,Disapointed,"I have not even turned it on yet and I am already disapointed. I bought this unit to mount it on the headrest so my son could watch videos on an upcoming (long) road trip. The only way to mount it is to put it in the pleather sleave and attach that to the headrest. Once it is in there, you cannot change DVD's without taking it all the way out. It is pretty much useless to me."
5,2nd Time's a Charm,"This year's DVD is awesome. I definitely reccomend that you buy it. There are some really great performances on there, especcially James Brown, MMW, Jack Johnson, and the thing that Scratch does at the end is really cool. As for the people complaining that their favorite artist isn't on there, I know how these things work, and it's due to artist permission, not Danny Clinch or Superfly. I would've liked to see Neil Young on there too, but there's nothing anyone could've done about it. With that in mind, with the performances they had to choose from, there are some really awesome clips on the DVD. Plus it looks and sounds great. Danny Clinch made this one awesome. I think its cool how its more like a movie than just a bunch of clips thrown together. If you've all seen the Woodstock movie, then pick up this DVD, it's totally worth it. Can't wait till 2004"
2,Why did this years suck?,"Why did this years DVD suck? 2002 is good, 2003 is bad. I was expecting 2003 to be even better but I was wrong. I certainly wont hold my breath for next year.Problems are: I think that there is bad camera work thruought the entire DVD. Performances are not shown in full. I would like to see the entire performance of a song rather than a collage of bad audio/visual work. Most of the songs chosen are just mediocre. Maybe that is out of your control but still, I know nothing about compiling a DVD, but I know that I could have done better.Advice to Producer: Let the music speak for itself, keep out your creativity, nobody asked for it. you have obviously ruined a potentially good DVD."
3,No Neil Young,"A search for Neil Young on DVD turned up this concert video so I bought it. Neil Young and Crazy Horse, despite headlining this concert, do not appear on the DVD. Anyone else purchasing this DVD should know that. Nothing like getting screwed."
3,Maybe for newbies?,"I have been playing poker for over 20 years, so I was looking for a game which would help me advance my game. Like most poker games, the players do stupid stuff. Not realistic.The tips can be useful for a new player though."
2,Huh?,"What happened to RCR, where is that style that oozed out every note. They come out with 3 albums that I can't get enough (Gangster Bop, Mugzy's Move and Caught in the Act) and then they come out with this schlock. I was able to listen to it 2-3 times before I had to give up on it. The album just couldn't get me moving. If anyone is interested in hearing this band stay clear of this album and look to the rest of their catalog. Their other albums just had more swing and more soul. I hope they get it back. To their credit they are still the only swing band that can get me boppin' around as much as Cab Calloway."
5,One of RCR's best!,"This release by RCR is absolutely great. My favorite songs are ""Salt Peanuts"" and ""The Contender."" Anyone who knows how to Shim Sham will like ""Friday the 13th""; it's a great 32-beat song perfect for Shim Sham dancing (even better, I think, than the frequently-used ""Tuxedo Junction""). RCR's upbeat melodies and catchy, fun-to-listen to lyrics make this one of their best releases."
5,COOL!!! Better than most!!!,These guys really know how to play a tune! This music just makes you wanna get up and dance!
3,Great (5 star) show though poor quality finale on DVD set,"Though this DVD set does not release until next week, I was able to purchase it from a local store yesterday. I purchased this season set for the final (3-part) episode, which I watched last night. Another reviewer stated that certain scenes in this episode are missing; I can't vouch for that as I do not intimately recall the aired finale nor do I have it on VHS. What I would like to make known is the substandard quality of the final episode itself. Though the majority of the episode is fine (similar in quality to that of the first 5 seasons which I own), several specific scenes look like they were taken from poor quality VHS tapes and spliced into the episode to make it the original length. When the episode shifts to one of these scenes, it is very jarring and watching these scenes is irritating. I cannot believe that a television episode that aired only 15 years ago can look so bad."
3,"great season, cheap set","i love cheers and owns all 11 seasons. though like other reviewers noted, the box set is really cheap, thus the three-star rating."
2,clogged up too many times,"I have had this one a long time and the unit would clog from day one. I do love my flavored coffees. Now it is not working at all. Previously, I have unplugged it and unclogged it with my cake tester (dangerous if plugged in!!). This time I think it's really dead and since I have had it about 5 years I think the company will balk at replacing it. Is it worth mailing and all the trouble of a repair........probably not. I love the weight of it but boo,hoo on not knowing about the clogging before I purchased it."
3,Not for flavored coffees,"This grinder looks cool and does a good job with plain beans, but it does have a couple of problems:1. You absolutely cannot use flavored coffee beans with this grinder. They get stuck in the exit spout and jam up the machine. This can burn out the motor very quickly if you don't catch it in time.2. The exit spout for the beans is rather long and a lot of grinds get left in it after using.3. The grinder is quite loud.I've had two of these grinders over the last 3 years. The first one worked great but the motor got burned out when a house guest tried to run flavored coffee through it without babysitting to make sure the grinds didn't jam up. KitchenAid was kind enough to replace the broken grinder under warranty. Now I reserve this unit for plain coffees and have a Krups for flavored beans."
2,well,i love champion and i have been looking for this cd for a long time and i find it on here for about 8 dollers used. The cd is in very poor shape every song skips at one point or another.
1,LoLo Jones,My wife has read some of his stuff and I just used the first 7 pages of this to light my outdoor fireplace. Ass Clown.
4,An interesting read ...,"Unlike a few of my fellow reviewers, I found the structure of the book to be interesting and would recommend it to anyone who caught up in the U.S. Women's run to the Women's World Cup Chanpionship.Briefly, the author used the Women's World Cup Final game as background, while intermittently weaving historical descriptions of the team members and women's sport in general, with a focus on Title IX. I felt there was only one occasion when I found this style to be confusing (Mia Hamm comments with a bad transfer to a different subject). I personally enjoyed the commentary of the affect of Title IX on team members and their generation, especially when the author compared the state of women's sport in the U.S. to other countries.The only real criticism I can offer is that I found the editing to be poor. There seemed to be a few instances in which sentence structure or word choice was incorrect - not that I'm an expert (my opinion only) :)."
3,"It is an oracle developer's reference, not a complete one","THis is a very convenient reference for beginers and intermmediate level Oracle Developers. However, it is far from sufficient for advanced Developers, not nentioning DBAs. It does not provide any info on performance tuning, which is critical for advanced level. The title is misleading in that it is neither comprehensive, nor goes in depth on some subjects, such as PL. If you want to be a qualified Oracle developer, this book is not sufficient, but definitely put you on road and running."
2,Good and Useful Book but CD does NOT work,"This is a good book for someone who has DBA background and some knowledge of Oracle, but for the money I spent on it I was hoping to see some examples/excecises/syntax in the CD, but guess what? I doesn't work!! I suggest to think twice before buying the book. Any one can help me?"
5,Awesome Flavor,"I've drank this flavor for years and still love it, would by it over and over again, you just have to try it."
3,Not better than the real thing!,"You will be disappointed if you expect something similar to last year's calendar. No posed photos of the band together. All concert shots and if you're buying it for photos of Bono, you'll be disapointed. I prefer pictures of the band together and clearer images."
4,What a shame,"Firefly is imaginative exiting and heartfelt. It is simply the best sci-fi... no scratch that, The best TV I've scene scince the X Files. The acting is very good, the stoyline is compeling and by the last episode I felt like I was part of the crew. I cant believe they pulled it before they even had a chance, does that remind you of anything?. So here we are stuck with law and order svcipu and the so called reality garb when we could be watching something truly original. What happened to TV that makes us think. Dont get me wrong but, Saving lives and putting away pervs is all good but, ITS ALL THE SAME! where is Capt Kirk, where is Moulder, where is River??? :( Science fiction does'nt mean out of this world, Firefly really hits home and holds a message for all of us right here in the 21st century. Watch the first episode and you'll be hooked, I was."
2,Heavily Annotated- Be Warned,"Be aware that this version of the text is not only abridged, but has commentary after nearly every single line. And while well done, it makes the whole thing feel a bit like a textbook. Good for some, but I didn't realize that it would be as heavily annotated as it is. In all honesty it should be marketed as a reader's companion, and the title should be different to make that clearer."
4,Go Thomas Go!,"My son, a Thomas fanatic, received this toy for his 2nd birthday. He is on and off of it all day long - he absolutely adores it. My only complaint is that the back handle comes off way to easily - it is now sitting in the corner of my living room because my son constantly takes it off. Other than that, if your child likes Thomas, than he/she will be thrilled with this toy!"
2,Don't Buy,"My son got this toy on his first birthday. He loved it. The second day he had it, one of the buttons broke. The next day, another button broke. I was very sad because my son loved this toy so much. I had to bring it back and get a different type of ride on. Which still works five months later. Don't buy it. It looks cute but it doesn't hold up to toddler play."
1,"Cute, but this is second time returning","My son loves his ""choo choo"" especially the theme song that plays when the button is pushed. Unfortunately our first Thomas' buttons seemed to have ""collapsed"" and they weren't able to play the sounds any longer. Fine, I brought it back and bought another one because this toy is so darn cute. Well, it has been one week and the same problem has occurred. The buttons that play the sounds have ""collapsed"" again! I can assure you my son has not abused the toy in any way and this defect is manufacturer fault. For such an expensive toy, I am very disappointed. Should I try and get a third one? I highly doubt I want to go through this trouble again. The other reveiws stating the back handle is too loose is also a concern and seems to be a standard across every Thomas Scootin' Sounds."
5,Gorgeous luggage set,Purchased this set for my husband for his birthday after looking at lots of ho-hum luggage pieces online and at local retailers. Am so glad that I decided to go with something as nice as this. The quality seems excellent. The leather is very high quality and attention to detail is wonderful. Package arrived from Italy surprisingly fast and in excellent condition. I am quite sure that my husband will love this and will be using it for years to come. One note: the lining is a solid chamois color rather than the stripe shown in the picture online.
2,Fun Disney movie -- poor DVD release.,"This was one of my favorite movies as a kid -- the DVD release is a major disappointment. While I didn't expect that this film would receive the ""Vault Disney"" or ""Special Edition"" treatment, it would have be nice if it would been released in its original theatrical ratios (widescreen). Please, Disney, give collectors the option; put pan-and-scan as well as widescreen versions on the same disc!!!"
1,Cable does not work.,"I purchased this cable for PS3 to 46"" Sanyou LCD. I get audio and no video. Do not buy this cable."
3,Better HDMI options out there.,"I commented fairly extensively on HDMI cable technology about 16 months ago. Some people are having a problem with this particular cable. I've found through doing several hook-ups of friend's and family's systems that they were usually doing something wrong in the hook-up process. Typically, after installing the HDMI cables they failed to change the source input/ouput to HDMI on their TV's or game consoles, or incorrectly matched the source resolution that best suits their TV. It is important to sync the hardware so it's all on the same page.That being said, I won't defend this cable. I don't use it. I found Blue Jeans Cable to be perfectly suited for my 1080p setup. I use Belden bonded-pair HDMI 1.3a cable (apx. $4/ft) throughout my system. Moving to 1.3a or better will help to futureproof your system. And any decent HDMI cable will operate your PS3, so you don't have to buy this one."
3,OK cable better elsewhere,"The most important factor that makes a good cable is gauge and quality of the wire in the cable, the second most important factor is the length. You should use the shortest cable possible. 8ft is likely much longer than most users will need. Also this cable is not made by Sony and it does not have any special advantages to using it with a PS3."
1,Very BAD Cable,"I bought the cable, but is not working good with my Samsung Plasma 1080p TV and my PS3.I you want only 720p it will work, but NO for FullHD."
5,Great item,"The HDMI Cable is working great. The purchase was great; shipping very quick. Would uy again. Thanks, Amazon."
4,Great Cable,"This is my first HD HMDI hook up and this cable definitely did the job..... after going HD, you can never go back.. :)"
5,Respect,"This 4th ave CD is the hottest joint going! Hot beats with the right lyrical content. If you don't have this CD yet, don't keep waiting, crab it, it's hot."
3,Mediocre,"Although this book includes extensive and interesting information on the inner workings of the British military of the mid-18th century, it is lacking in information on Wolfe himself. A good book for general information it only rates mediocre as a biography."
4,"A great card, but USB reader is overhyped","I bought this for my Canon Digital Rebel and Powershot S400 cameras, and it works great. If you're using an old slow card, and not a high-speed Lexar or Sandisk Ultra card, you can notice the difference in upgrading to a faster card! If you take photos in rapid succession, the write time is much faster, and maybe even battery life is longer since the camera spends less time writing. (Of course, the quality of your photos will remain exactly the same.)However, the USB card reader that comes with this Lexar card is NOT compatible with other brands of flash cards! It works fine with the Lexar card, but DOES NOT WORK with other brands such as my Sandisk or Canon cards. Keep in mind that if you have a USB 2.0 port, and a USB 2.0 device, your photos will transmit from your camera to your computer MUCH faster. (And most digital cameras are still the older USB 1.1, so a card reader makes a huge difference in transfer time.)"
3,No improvement for the digital camera(canon A80) (-_-),"I don't notice any improvement speed for my digital camera. If you have cannon A80, this card may not be good chioce.However, it's very nice that the card comes with both a USB reader and rescue software."
5,OBIE BERMUDEZ IS THE MAN !!!!,"Wow...I'll start off by admiting that this time we finally have someone that has the perfect sound to Salsa music. I just enjoy listening to all the songs but songs especially with meaning of love for one another like ""Te me vas"" and ""Uvo momentos."" I give credit also to the musicians that helped make the Album...THUMBS UP GUYS....GREAT JOB !!"
1,Buyer beware!!,I just recently bought this and was disappointed to find out it doesn't work. You need a all region player to view this DVD. Only plays on computer.
3,Mondovino,"It's kinda slow moving and a little hard to watch, the camera moves all around and you have to read sub-titles. But overall enjoyable."
2,Camera work makes it hard to watch,"Mondovino was interesting to me as a wine buff, but as a television professional, it was hard to watch. I know that cinema vérite films are traditionally shot hand-held in an informal style, but this film was shot so poorly that you could actually get motion sickness watching it on a large screen. It literally looks like it was shot by a child with a short attention span. The shots are filled with gratuitous zooms, shaky long shots, and close-ups that are too close. The quality of the photography seriously compromised my enjoyment of the subject matter and to me makes the film seem like an amateur effort."
3,Good documentary with a terrible soundtrack,"For such a commercially successful documentary , Mondovino had some of the worst music I have ever heard. The fact that the bad music left such a lasting impression attests to how awful it was. The film contained a few eye-roll worthy cliches, like oaky American wines are ""destroying the world"" and how ""all corporations are evil."" Aside from the bad soundtrack and occasional passe cliches, the documentary was very interesting and lived up to a lot of its hype."
4,Good value,"Good value, it is what it is. Glutamine is a great supplement for everyone. I recommend this to anyone who is looking to put on muscle."
3,"Not good, but nice",It's a great card for stragidy games and older games like Quake 2 but for newer games like Quake 3 and Diablo 2 you need a AGP voodoo. a V3-3k is a great cad for these games. This card is a great card for PCI but i highly recomend a better AGP voodoo for todays games.
2,Incorectly labeled DVD,The distributor did not label this DVD correctly. The songs listed on the cover are NOT the songs on the DVD! Buyer Beware. I sent for a replacement and it is the same as the first one.
4,Bravo for Angela Lansbury,I have all of the productions you can purchase for Sweeney Todd and was fortunate enough to have attended this production in NYC. The singing is great and musical one of my favorite. Angela Lansbury is over the top in this production and worth the entire experience..
3,It's Ok,I ordered this to write a comparitive paper for theis version and the newer movie version. The actors are good Lansbury rocks in it. I just found it harder to decipher the events than in the movie.
5,Sensational Sweeney,Excellent video of the musical with the original Broadway cast. A must for Sondheim lovers. Gives you the feeling that you're right there in the audience.
4,Good service.,"The DVD arrived incredibly quickly. I have yet to watch it, but I love SWEENEY TODD, so I know it will be good."
2,Demon barber becomes victim of demon editor,"I love Sweeney. Hate the re edit. Whats with all the TV style closeups? Loses a lot of the original stageplay feel that gives this production its charm. Who's idea was it to messwith near perfection...sigh. My tape finally broke so I got this and was initially very excited until I saw what they had done to it. Better than nothing but I wish I still had the orginal VHS. Worth watching, yes, marginally. Taking the audience out as one other person put it does kill the ""LIVE"" ambiance(sp). Quality marginally better than the tape. So many sighs, so little time."
2,Did not like Elling,Sorry but this movie was not my style. The acting was decent but the storyline was just something I personally did not like. The government taking care of people is something questionable and this movie was picturing it in a very sugar coated way.
4,Funny and quirky,"Interesting perspective of an ""odd couple"" Very similiar to Oscar and Felix with european overtones. Enjoyed although some gaps in the flow of the movie."
3,Speed Increase Not Noticeable,"Didn't notice a speed increase, but I've had problems with my Kingston 256mb card. I lost images 3 times and had to run disk recovery software on the card. This Lexar card has been stable and reliable. Worth it to me."
4,Unreleased? False Advertisement,Most of these matches were on old ECW VHS tapes I own by Pioneer Ent and some i taped myself. If tou dont own or havent seen the matches it's a great buy! Its more convenient to watch for me now though.
4,Enjoyable Read,"This book details one Englishman's trip through Ireland while looking for his roots. Some parts of this book show a bias one one way or another (As is the author's right. It IS his book)That said, this book is quite good. Mr. McCarthy does a good job of providing an outsider's view on Ireland while providing vivid descriptions of his travels in Western Ireland.Having been there, I can indentify with a lot of what he has to say. (especially fat, loud, American Tourists. There were a whole ton of em' at the bus depot in Galway.)All in all, this was a good book. If you buy it, I reccomend that you get Tony Hawks ""Round Ireland With a Fridge"", too."
2,Irishpaul,"Although the author visited many places in Ireland, I found his descriptions of the places boring. After reading this book, I have no desire to visit these small dull towns and people in Ireland. The Irish people that he met and the way he describes them sounded uninteresting and stuffy. I'm sure the scenery was great but the book ain't. Unless you really know or are interested in the back towns of western Ireland, you will be disappoined with this unexciting book. Sorry..."
4,A great book on the true Ireland,"A highly entertaining look at modern Ireland. McCarthy's Bar spins a wife array of enjoyable stories about Irish travel, while mixing in insightful commentary on the true meaning of being Irish. I starting reading this book on vacation and quickly found the nearest pub. After two pints of Guinness the book got even better. The writing style is crisp and the humor is....well Irish. The chapter describing the busloads of overweight Americans searching for their Irish heritage was the highlight."
1,False claims by Mary Lefkowitz,"What Colour was Hannibal?Not Out of Africa Revisited: How Eurocentrism Became an Excuse to Teach History as MythThese books prove beyond any doubt that what Mary Lefkowitz tells us must be seriously scrutinized. Her facts are simply not true.Much of what Mary Lefkowitz has written is wrong. For instance a city called Rhacotis existed before Alexandria was built. This city had its own temple/chapel with its own library, which was absorbed by The Library of Alexandria. Ancient writers have mentioned this city.Also, there are existing coins that proves that Hannibal was Black. Socrates was also Black. Aesop and Terence were all Blacks.Read the Book 'Not Out of Africa Revisited.'"
4,An extra star on principle (or to balance detractors),"In isolation, I'd give this book 3-stars: it's ok, but really all you need is the original article in the New Republic to get the point. Still, it's sad to see the comments of her detractors here - comparisons to ""The Bell Curve"" and barely-contained seething. It recalls the shameful 60 minutes show when she went to an African American college and was barely allowed to speak - even the supposed-to-be-neutral ""moderator"" showed utter hostility to her. I'm not an antrhopologist, but so far I've seen or read nothing to contradict the specific facts she has presented other than sweeping generalizations, and that includes an article in Emerge that purported to do just that. Will a real Afrocentrist anthropologist please stand up?"
2,then I guess the greeks were liars,"I have read books on both sides of the issue and Mary did not handle herself well though she fought hard.. It was noted by other greek philosophers that Egypt was a land of blacks. So, Why did she forget to mention that part of history. Gerald massey among others were white scholars who mentions the same things as Bernal, Vansertima, Dr. Ben. So, why did she not take on the other white scholar. Seems to me she was only speaking out of frustration and anger.On another note there are some crazy people out there that says the black man created every thing which is not true. Contribution was made by all including the Africans."
1,"The author satisfies right-wing, eurocentric, sexual fears.","I will not be as emotional as others who denounce this pseudo-literaryattempt by this relatively unimportant ""author."" She isnothing more than a continuation of Carlyle, Bell Curve, Shockley,etc. Again, nothing more and nothing new. This false research paper ofa book is nothing more than anti-Afrocentric -- with little to noevidence presented to support her claims. ....Ifyou desire to be semi-objective, start by reading Return to Glory byJoel Freeman and pay careful attention to his footnotes. ....Now, I've gotten all that off my chest. I feela lot better. I hope AMAZON.COM places my review along with all theothers who praise Ms. Leftkowitz' efforts."
2,"A bold achievement, but built on shaky ground","I will acknowledge that Mary Lefkowitz was bold to take on the Afrocentric movement, however I feel that anyone who accepts her theories over those of Diop obviously hasn't read Diop's work. There is simply too much evidence supporting Diop and relatively little supporting Lefkowitz, who admits she is no expert on Egyptology. (Who cares if Cleopatra wasn't black! She was born well after the Egyptian Golden Years, after Egypt had been conquered by the Greeks . . . a time during which intermarriage was encouraged by the Ptolemies.) In summation, her book is entertaining and provocative, but far from authoritative or revolutionary. Though I don't necessarily agree with the Afrocentrics, I agree more with them than I can with Lefkowitz, at least until she comes up with some more convincing evidence . . ."
5,A Breath of Fresh Air,There has been so much afrocentric revisionist history passed-off as legitimate history in recent years that I fear most young people will never be able to discern the difference. This book dares to address some of the most blatant historical hijackings and does so with legitimate academic integrity. In reading the lower ratings that reviewers have given this book I have to wonder whether (1) they actually read this text or (2) have a blind afrocentric agenda that they see text threatening. This book is likely to be an essential addition to anyone's collection of historical texts.
4,Really Good for the price,"these swords are verry high quality for the price, they are sharpened to near razor quality, and perfect for the serious collector and swordsmanship student alike, it is practical, but dont go around cutting down trees or anything."
1,Wretched Acting,"So wanted it to be good. It was unwatchable. I tried twice to watch it, but just couldn't get past the first 1/2 hour"
2,Cute Nostagla Piece,Dated. Irrelevant for today's teens but it was cute. My mother would have liked it. Not sure what else to say about it. It was what it was.
2,This Stinks,"HiThis Book Sucks!That is unless you like books with boring stories and never ending sentences. Or if you don't like these. -}. This is a book of random stories. They don't really suffice for fireside readingHope you don't buy this{ for your sake},Hannah"
2,Be sure that you have an extra cooling fan inside !!,"If you are a tech savvy lives in a hot climate area and the most of your PCI slots are already occupied, please make sure that you have an extra cooling fan inside the machine to blow out the heat.The card emits significant heat and it does not come along with attached cooling fan. Attached static cooler is not enough.My card has broken after nine months."
3,video capturing,I noticed using 3 different softwares for video capturing that it dropped too many frames. The picture came out choppy not synchronizing with the audio.
2,"RJ Watford of Cleveland, Ohio","The product is easy to install but I was not particularly impressed with the display clarity on the television. I also had to spend quite a bit of time reseting my monitor after the install process. Finally, the written instructions were okay but could have been better, i.e. written for rookies and veterans."
5,"Great book, Poor Edition","Having read this excellent work before, I wanted to acquire a fresh copy of it for sharing from my library. Unfortunately, this paperback edition is merely a very poor photocopy (yes, photocopy!) of the small out-of-print paperback edition that I already had. Too bad."
2,The most uninspiring text-book I've personally experienced as a student,"After reading this textbook one might decide hang him/herself out of sheer despair to ever be able to follow the logic of the conclusions and assumptions presented by the authors. Nevermind mistakes, lack of explanations of seemingly incosistent statements (perceived, perhaps, but that says enough about the clarity of the writing), ostensible deficit of insight and dull presentation... Thankfully, my professor did a much better job during the lectures and hopefully managed to salvage some credibility of the field and preserve students' interest in behavioral theories.I am not sure if there are alternatives to this textbook out there, but they are definitely needed. Considering the quality of my other textbooks on various academic subject including psychology, this was a very unpleasant surprise... quite inhibitive, CS+."
1,"Beware the bad, bad button","When it worked, it worked great. Unfortunately, I've had to replace it twice and finally gave up. Why? The pulse button stops working. On each and every one, it would get harder to get the pulse button to work, and then just impossible. Something under the soft cover of the button is just not holding up. I don't use this for hard stuff like nuts and seeds, just for things like pesto, or grinding up cooked pasta sauces to a finer consistency.It's really too bad, because the style is great (pretty and compact), and the engine works well. But it just isn't terribly helpful to put in a bunch of stewed meat and veggies to whirr, and then find out the button won't work. Last night, I had to use a potato masher and smooosh the sauce by hand. Today, I bought a different brand food chopper."
3,decent effort,"i liked all the songs picked for this album, def a good compilation, its just i didnt like how he mixed them. some of them sounded kinda sloppy and some were way too repetitive. if these songs were mixed the same way they were on the previous costes albums this wouldve def gotten five stars."
1,PIECE OF CRAP STOPPED WORKING THE SAME DAY,"I got this Item and it worked for about 4 hours, then stopped working, I tried the reader in 2 different computers nothing... I contacted Lexar customer support and they couldn't help me, save your money and buy something else."
5,Speedy,"Compared to other card readers I have experienced, this one is quick and easy. much preferred method of transferring digital images. gets the job done."
2,Wrong suggestion,"This wasn't a good suggestion from a friend of mine to buy this.I couldn't appreciate the melody of these soft songs not made for my years 70's rock generetion. Other are my preferred guitar players: Clapton, Townshend, Lee, Gallagher, Springsteeen, Hendrix etc. and other are my beloved rythms.I'll be happy in providing Amazon with comments about other better purchases.Thank you for the excellent quality of your general service"
5,Too Cool,Yes it is nice and the mesh allows the wind to cool your head. Can't wait for the 137 degree summer.
1,To Expensive!!!,Buy this anywhere at retail stores or online at http://www.upgrade-solution.com/ for example for $214.00.
2,"Great Price, but you get what you pay for","I was excited about the price and the previous reviews, but this product was disappointing. I bought it for my 18-month old daughter but the sound was muffled and subpar. I may have to spring the $45-$50 to get a real drum that actually works."
2,Bad overview,"A very unsophisticated review of the European National Parks. Not recommendable. You must have a knowledge of the parks not included in the book, to be able to use the book as a guide. Nice pics, though..."
5,RICH THE FACTOR IS GOING OFF THE HEZEE,"WE JUST GONE KEEP IT ORKA, MY BOY RICH THE FACTOR IS GOING OFF, MIGHT I SAY OFF THE CHIZAIN. ALL MY KC PLAYYA'S IS AS A MATTER OF FACT YOUNG.T AND TUAN, RUSH, SWELL'L TECH 9, DECO D, YOUNG FE, GREEDY, BIG 12 , VEL BAKARDY, AND MUCH MORE. MUCH LOVE TO MY BOY RICH. I BET YOU WILL BE FEELING THIS ALBUM AND MANY MORE, HE'S KEEP'S IT POPPIN. UNTIL THEN RICH, KEEP GRITTIN AND LET THE HATER'S HATE LIKE FOX. TO ALL THOSE FEELING RICH STAY A FACTOR, UNTIL THEN I'MA KEEP GRITTIN I HAS NO TIME TO BE BS! RIP YOUND WEE WEE."
2,Don't waste your money,I purchased this book on recommendation from a Promotional Preparation course I recently attended. It is horrible! It isn't worth the time or money to read. It basically tells you how to cheat on written exams by looking for certain words in the questions and answers. If you honestly read the material you are supposed to and take your written exam you will do much better than to try the tactics this book suggests.
4,"Yep, she said that out loud","Good but not the usual Chonda. Some old material included but even then she graciously poked fun at herself for using it. Missed the uplifting message usually present in her work. Her work is usually a 9, I give her an 8 on this but she's still a 10."
1,"It might have been a good product, BUT...","This appears to be an excellent product, however, due to extremely poor packaging (that appeared to have been damaged PRIOR to shipping)and UPS shipping, it arrived with several areas shattered into tiny plastic shards. I would only buy it again if it were better packed for shipping."
5,The only HTML book you will ever need!,"For the intermediate level HTML programmer, this book covers a wide variety of topics such as style sheets, dynamic HTML, scripting, table and frame design, etc. I refer to it constantly."
2,To bias,I bought this book recomended by some site. I quickly found out although it does go into some detail of Netscape browser it highly discourages people to use them and goes further by asking them to skip the netscape sections. This book encourages people to support Microsoft and encourages people to use code that is not compatible with other browsers in a since.A lot of helpfull info in it but because of its bias strategy I give it a 2. Book is somewhat old now but decided to learn the older stuff so what I learned to code would be compatible with almost any browsers. Im gonna have to say I would discourage making this book a choice for your studies.
4,"Not as good as some of their other albums, but still good.","The WWMT energy is still there, though their style has shifted from almost completely techno/rave to more of a hip-hop/disco/whathaveyou style. The album is still definitely worth getting."
3,Not Jordan's Favorite Either But Alot Goin On Visually,"I think he would agree that this film is too heavy on camera and not strong on script. But considering the budget - $850,000 it really is to be watched. Jordan's ability to master visuals with no money is unheard of. Look at the downtown LA chase and the use of helicopters and pyros! There is also a touching performance he gets from a child actress Kritina Molata. Charlie Mattera the lead, was a real life bank robber. So there is a lot more going on than meets the eye."
2,Hokey and naive,"The offenses in this text range from citing surveys that show the emotional differences between the sexes narrowing (hint: surveys about attitude reflect the desired perception, rather than reality) to the usual hackneyed predictions about the growth of e-commerce and Java-based refrigerators. It's a superficial and uninspiring roundup of all the press release style journalism you'd find in Wired or Business 2.0. This is the kind of material that might be ""inspiring"" if you were to set your sights low enough. No breakthroughs here, although I suppose it's a serviceable summary of many of the trends that have already been predicted to death elsewhere."
2,Not working / No support,I bought this item late January. Less than two months and it is dead. I have Windows 2000 and XP and after working good without any problems now it is not recognized by the either operating system. All the other devices work fine on the USB port. In the device manager I just get the yellow question mark with UNKNOWN DEVICE. Lexar Live support and tech support have not helped at all. I still have not got a reply from them. Now I cannot access some of my important information.Good idea - back-up your media often if you own a USB drive. I thought the idea was to reduce the workload and need to use your memory on your p/c by having these drives but I have found that is not the case. Very disappointed.
2,Where did all the examples go?,"This book needed to be proofread by more than the author.Approximately 30% of all of the information in the figures is missing. Few of the greek characters got printed in the figures for an advanced dynamics book that makes it impossible to read.Another point of interest to the reader is that the first chapter has ~40 pages, and there are ~40 pages of problems. It just goes to show the author should have put more (some) effort and time into explanations, and less into the pure copying of others dynamics problems. Who needs an advanced dynamics book with more than 200 problems in one chapter alone.The material presented here would be decent if there were 10 times the number of example problems and the figures showed relevant information. I cannot believe that an author would honestly publish this work without reading through it first."
2,beware of title,"Although this book contains the usual advanced topics in classical mechanics, one must be aware of the meaning of its title. It indicates that its contents of classical mechanics are at the advanced level for engineers but not quite at the level and sophistication essential for advanced graduate work in physics; it lacks exposure in Hamiltonian formalism and advanced mathematics (differentiable manifolds, exterior forms, etc.), material which I believe is important to serious physics studentsI strongly surmise that engineering students can benefit most from this book. It contains a large body of homework problems, some of them copied from Schaum's Lagrangian Dynamics and other books. This book is somewhat readable, though Prof. Torok's choice of symbols often clouds my analysis.Too expensive of a hardcover, I am better off with my old Marion or Landau."
3,"Melding several great rock styles, and shining on several.","This album features some tracks that are quite beautiful, using electronic, melodic sounds on ""Beautiful Again"", and pleasant imagery in ""The Highway"" and ""The Piano"". ""Small Town Parade"" has a jangle-pop feel, an innocent and fun tune. Tracy Marie's vocals were excellent on the above tracks. I was less fond of the harsh sound of ""Symbol"", in which she seems to go out of vocal range. There is a variety of style on the CD, but sometimes the vocals don't match the tone of the music, my only citation here. It appears that this artist from Cleveland has plenty of talent and let's hope we can see continued development. Worth a listen."
3,not for the long term,"I did alot of research and purchased this toaster oven. I have used it daily for about a year and a half. It is ok for toast and cooking. my last two toaster ovens lasted forever - they never died, I merely purchased a different one. This one is falling apart already - the convection fan has started sounding VERY loud!!!! and sometimes (not always) the timer just gets stuck - and continues to cook until the burning smell gets your attention."
1,Lasted 18 months,"This was a nice unit while it lasted -- 18 months. The timer stopped working. Silly, since they could have used a better timer and charged a couple dollars more at most. Now I won't buy Euro Pro again."
1,Low quality,"I've had this toaster oven for over a year and have had to replace the timer switch twice. Overall features are fine, but it's designed to, after the warranty period ends, be tossed in the trash."
5,The Boys are back - with their best yet!,"After listening to the UK promo copy of ""Nightlife"" about 10 times, I can honestly say this is the best work the Pet Shop Boys have done yet! Every stage of young, edgy life at night is depicted in these songs - from the insecurity of ""You Only Tell Me You Love Me When You're Drunk,"" ""I Don't Know What You Want...,"" and ""The Only One,"" through the classic club glory of ""For Your Own Good,"" ""New York City Boy"" and ""Closer to Heaven,"" to the morning-after feel of ""Radiophonic,"" ""Boy Strange,"" and ""Vampires."" This gorgeous music reminds us what nightlife is supposed to be - exotic, erotic, and full of possibilities. Listen to this on a Friday or Saturday night, and just TRY to stay away from the clubs! For your own good, buy this album tonight!"
5,"aka ""Perfection.""","The critics would never admit it, but this is hands-down one of the best CD experiences of the past year, a sublime journey through the night filled with intelligence, humor, sadness and beauty. Another masterpiece from possibly the most underrated pop outfit of the past twenty years. Bravo."
3,Overrated,"I have bought every single PSB album there is. I have been a big fan and follower of PSB's music since the early 80's. I've liked every single CD I've purchased. But this CD is overrated in this forum. It is good, but not that good, compared with previous CD's... certainly, not the best of PSB's work as other reviewers claim. Some of the song lyrics are not appealing to heterogeneous, male audience. Discounting such lyrics, I admit the beat is good for tracks 1, 2, 3, and 4. I particularly liked ""I don't know what you want but I can't give it anymore"", ""You only tell me you love me when you're drunk"", and ""Footsteps"" (good slow song). ""Nightlife"" is also OK. Sorry guys, girls, and others. I'm hopeful the next CD will be better."
3,Disappointment from a huge Pet Shop Boys fan!,"After consuming nearly everything the PSB recorded Nightlife comes as a grave disappointment. The only redeeming factor on the album is the five danceable tracks which are complete with thoughtful lyrics that we come to expect from the PSB. The other tracks seem like they were written by a child and not innovative artists such as the PSB. For example, ""I'm a vampire you're a vampire too."" I really enjoyed their previous works they have all the elements that make the Pet Shop Boys an original dance-duo. Nightlife rates as there worst effort to date if this is what I can anticipate in another three years the PSB can call it a night!!"
2,Lame - Not the Real PSB,"If you like high pitched ... sounding music, this is it. If you like the classic PSB sound, this is not it. I don't like every song on this album reminding me of their sexual persuasion."
4,They tried hard and mostly succeeded.,"Normally PSB's production is immaculate, so I was pretty shocked to hear what sounds like a little boo-boo in the piano riff at 2:55 on ""Vampires."" But overall, the sound is great. Definitely their most skillful use of new sounds and special effects yet.""For Your Own Good"" is a great opener: tense, thumping, and builds to a climax like ""Discoteca"" did. On the downside, ""In Denial"" sounds like a bad parody of show tunes. One of the tracks even has slide guitar which while surprising, sounds totally wrong in this album's context. But for good, creative dance music, you can't go wrong with tracks 1, 2, 3, 7 and 11."
5,Brought Back Great Memories,"We purchased this for my brother-in-laws household. We had something similar to this growing up, and have fond memories of sitting and listening to the readings, and looking at the pictures. We were glad to be able to bring a little of that to him, and now that he has started his family, we are hopefully doing the same for them. I love that it has pages for the family history too."
5,The Best of the Willie Colon/Hector Lavoe LPs,"This extraordinary recording contains Willie Colon and Hector Lavoe at their best. To me, ""Lo Mato"" is Willie & Hector's finest because this album contains great hits like ""Calle Luna, Calle Sol"" and ""Todo Tiene Su Final"". The band was on target and Hector Lavoe's vocals flowed like a mighty river.Personally, my favorites are ""El Dia De Suerte"" and ""La Maria"" (penned by the late Catalino Curet Alonso). If you want to start a Willie Colon or Hector Lavoe collection I highly recommend this classic.Hector Lavoe Lead vocalsJoe Torres PianoJose Mangual Jr. BongosMilton Cardona CongaLouis Romero TimbalesEric Matos TromboneSanti Gonzalez BassJohnny Pacheco CoroJusto Betancourt CoroWillie Colon Leader/Coro/T-Bone"
1,Well...,it's a nice looking lunch box. It replaced a different red sox lunch box that had lasted 3 years. But I guess this one was made by a different company & it barely lasted 5 months. The seams inside started pulling apart about a month after daily use to school for an elementary school student. Thank goodness for duct tape! LOL! So I wouldn't recommend this product based on that. The outside is very durable. I like the removable shoulder strap & it has a removable piece inside if you like to keep your drink separate from your food (as my children do).
2,not that great,I have no idea what all those people are saying but these bars don't taste that great...it is full of sugar and high fructose corn syrup. I much prefer luna bars or the south beach meal bars--which all taste tons better and are healthier.
1,Would not spend the money....,"This toy is too hard for little ones to figure out, even with adult supervision. The dolls do not stand in their special stage shoes, they tip easily and knock over their instruments. The stage in small and even little hands have a hard time playing in such a small space. My daughter is 6 and was disappointed."
4,I learned a lot from this book.,I used this book in a book study with other teachers and we learned some very interesting history from it.
5,This should be in every sensualists' library,"The cover is demure but the words inside are not. Erotic Poems has selections from some of my all time favorite poets and I have discovered many more. If you love poetry, you should get this book. If you are an erotician, you should get this book. If you love classical literature, you should get this book. In fact, just get the book!"
2,Cheap looking,The necklace in the picture looks a lot thicker and heavier than it is. For a two hundred dollar necklace it's very cheap looking. I wouldn't have paid more than twenty five bucks for the necklace!
2,Decent but NO way NEAR A Full Orchestra!,"in all fairness, this isn't TERRIBLE, but most tracks don't sound much different from their originals. In some cases they sound WORSE, like Prelude and Libera Fatali. But for what you pay, thats what you get :P This BTW is the SAME as the Final Fantasy 1994-1999 CD, just with one more track NOT by the *snicker* Hollywood Orchestra. The 12th NEW track is a piece done by Project Majestic Mix and it's the best tune on the CD. PMM is a FAN-Based project tributing Nobuo Uematsu, one of the best game soundtrack composers out there...."
2,10 Videos,"This DVD contains 10 videos totaling 40 minutes. Audio and video quality is not that great, with the picture especially being of poor quality and just not very sharp. The videos are as follows: Alexandre Pires - Amame; Patricia Manterola - Ojos Negros; Los Razos - Atacando A Berlin (remix); Jerry Rivera - Vuela Muy Alto; Millie - En Cuerpo Y Alma; Cristian - No Hace Falta; Gisselle - Marchate; Aterciopelados - Mi Vida Brilla; Pablo Montero - Cuando Calienta El Sol; and Beny More - Bonito Y Sabrosa."
1,Shear disappointment - BUY CRAFTSMAN!,"BEWARE! Do not purchase this or any other product by KARCHER. They, may in some cases (rare as they might be), make a fine product... not here! This fine little piece of junk burnt up after 5 uses (all vehicles! no strenuous work at all!) Forget their so-called ""warranty"", they refer you to a local service dealer and then refuse the claim. I guess it will make a nice $100 lawn ornament at the local landfill. My mistake. Once again, BEWARE!!!!!"
2,Don't waste your time,"Video was very boring and not very informative. Clinical terminology was used which is not helpful to non-medical persons. Basically showed a 30 minute massage, step by boring step. Unattractive person narrating...Ugh!"
4,Unknown artist worth a hearing,"Unknown doesn't mean undeserving. This is a unique blend of music, probably best described as alternative country. It has a definite rock influence, and even an occasional reggae beat (now who else has ever combined rock, country and reggae?). Lionel de Bernard is an oustanding songwriter, and the songs have great rhythm, outstanding melodies and lyrics. Here's a songwriter who deserves to have his music heard more widely."
2,Needs Improvment,A design that still needs work. I have the 6 gallon version of this item. The plastic hose collapsed the first time I ran gas through it. The short hose on the inside of the tank got soft and fell off into the tank. They need to improve the quality of their materials to make this item usable. I bought some better hose and it works much better. There is a gas smell in the garage. I don't know if it is from the fuel left in the hose\ handle or that the valve does not fit very tight to the tank so that might be where the evaporation is coming from. I have to remove the siphon apparatus and cap normally when storing.I would not recommend this product until improvements are made.
2,You get what you pay for,"Bought this item to experiment with the univibe sound. For 30 bucks, this sounds okay, but you can see why people are willing to pay upwards of 250 for something that really has the watery swirly character. Fairly uninspiring sound, doesn't immediately force you to play Pink Floyd for half an hour. Maybe on different rigs or at louder volumes this would work for a few songs, but at least for me, I should've saved my money.My main complaint, however, is that the pedal is very noisy. I have a nice VOODOO lab's power supply , and even with that there is a lot of buzz and hum with this pedal as soon as you engage it."
3,Wears out quickly,"These slippers are pretty and I've worn them for a year now, but the inside hasn't held up very well. The bottom of the slippers inside is wearing very thing. The outside of the slipper still looks great, though."
3,Read the description carefully before buy -- this model does NOT transform,This is my first transformer toy and how disappointed I was when I got it only to find out it can't transform. I can only blame myself -- I should have read the description carefully...
2,Marginal,"I bought this to use in place of a full home theater system. I now have it under my 19 inch den tv. It improves on the speakers in the 19"" TV, but nowhere near as well as my $50.00 Creative computer speakers when I hooked them up, just for comparison purposes. There is a marginal surround effect but it is very limited. The sound reproduction is better than that of the tiny speakers in the 19"" set, but I do not find the sound particularly crisp. The one advantage it has over the computer speakers is that the volume is controlled through the TV. Otherwise, I feel like I spent $150 too much."
1,Lies & delusions of uber feminists,"Usual cleche all men all bad, where women go wrong is emulating men. Old story done to a crisp will be handy fodder for a generation of man haters. None of mans wars can match the casualties of Rowe vs Wade, a fact convieniently ignored by female supremasists.in a word ""BILGE"""
3,I want to like this show,"I started watching this show for the same reason probably everyone else did: Mindy Kaling.I find it a bit of a disappointment - I think she can do better. I mean, I guess maybe it's a realistic portrayal of life - though my life is nothing like it, but parts of it just seem.... played out, maybe?Maybe the problem is that I don't like Mindy's character, so it's hard to like the series. She's shallow and complains all the time. She has issues with men, but always goes for the creepy guys. I can't tell if she's actually with the guy she is sleeping with, or not. It's all vaguely confusing.Maybe with a few more episodes under its belt it won't feel like its trying so hard."
2,"Some good things, more bad things","Good things: (1) Baby loves watching the hanging toys. (2) The nature sounds are very well done and very pleasant.Bad things: (1) VERY troublesome to assemble. The supplied screws are a cheap metal and they are screwed into plastic threads. In the most critical support structure (the kickstand) I could not get all of the screws into their holes completely before the screws stripped out. But I did get it together well enough to use. However, I considered returning it to the store during assembly. (2) The vibration feature broke after about 1 month of use. (3) Baby cannot reach the toys, even at 3 months of age, and we have a very tall baby. (4) Toys are very easily removed from their ""holes"" so that you can't really move the chair without the toys falling out. (5) The rocker has a very big ""footprint"". It takes up about half of the surface area of our four-seat kitchen table."
4,"Baby Loves, But Not A Bouncer","This seat was very difficult to put together. The instructions were confusing, and the parts were not labeled in any way. ""Attach right bottom to control assembly"" Hey, both pieces look alike, how the heck should I know which one is the ""right"" or the ""left""? You actually have to screw in the back, and the screws are cheap and strip easily. We had to use a drill, even though the instructions warn against it. Why doesn't that piece come already assembled? It makes no sense because the box was huge enough to support a partially assembled seat. Also, the seat does not rock very much, and not at all with the kickstand down. But...aside from this, the music is nice, the vibration is good, and baby especially loves the toy bar."
2,I'm not impressed... at all,"I bought this rocker because it looks really nice and like a baby would enjoy it... mine does not! I also liked that it went up to 40lbs so I wouldn't have to tell my toddler ""no you can't play in it"". He doesn't like it either. It does vibrate and it is kinda cute you can hook up your Ipod, but just buy speakers for your Ipod. The toys fall of very easily and aren't really accessible to the baby anyway. So to sum up I would just get a diferent bouncer!"
2,Broken already!,"My seat is BRAND NEW and I love it, but it has already quick working. I've changed the batteries reapeatedly and it still only works occassionaly. It won't vibrate at all and the music only plays sometimes. VERY DISAPPOINTED."
3,Karcher k395,"When this machine works it is awesome. The problem is, when it works. I have had to replace the wand once and the trigger sprayer once and I have only used it 4 times. My problem is with Karcher themselves. If you try to buy a replacement part it is nearly impossible to contact them and when you do you get ripped off for the replacement parts. There is no internet replacement parts center so you have to call an 800 number and hope that you have the right part. This is the 21st century, someone please tell Karcher."
5,Excellent book for Infants,This book was wonderful to have when my children were first born. They both loved to look at the pictures and were fascinated with it. It would help calm them down when they were fussy and kept play time on the floor interesting. I highly recommend to any new mom.
2,Below my expectation,"I had high expectation for this book after checking up great reviews on Amazon. Yet my baby is just not interested in this book compared to other books I bought. She showed little interests when she was five months. Now she is nine months, still not interested.Her favorite books are those with colorful animals. I recommend Fuzzy Bee and Friends (Cloth Books), Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes (Baby Board Books) or Sassy First Sounds Book Set and Cube."
3,Great to stare at,This book has really kept the interest of my 7 week old. I'll prop the book open to various page after reading it to him and he'll stare at the page for a while. The contrast is really great.
4,high contrast pictures,"our baby is very interested in these high contrast pictures. there is not much story to engage with... (i like our similar hello, bugs book better)"
5,sharp,I don't think you could find a better knife for the price. I bought this knife for quartering chickens and chopping chocolate and it does very well at both. I also bought their santoku knife as a gift for a friend and it works very well.
5,"Victronix Cutlery 10"" Knife",Bought this for my son - a budding chef. He loves it and treats it with great care.
2,The knife is shart but,"I agree with the point of another previous buyer: ""The balance point is somewhere in the middle of the blade, rather than where one would normally grip a knife"". This make your grip a little awkward and dangerous to use."
4,"So far so good, just not blown away.","I should have tempered my expectations based on the level of hype around this knife. Don't get me wrong, it seems like a nice knife, and I was happy with the price. But were I to have spent $50 on this, I might not have been so happy. Also - and this is no one's fault but my own - I should have gotten the 8-inch; the 10-inch is just a big knife, bigger than I needed."
5,"Great wire strippers, get a pair!","As others have indicated, these Klein wire strippers are -the- strippers to have. I've used a few others before, but they don't compare with these at all. Klein makes some great tools and there's a reason they're so popular among tradesmen. This product is a shinning example of what makes Klein so great -they're well designed, functional and effective. You can strip wires like nobody's business with these things, they're razor sharp and very nice to hold in your hand. I love the curved handle and the comfortable grips, makes it much easier to use.Get yourself a pair of these if you're in the market for a wire stripper, you'll be glad you did. Definitely worth every penny."
2,didn't last,"Bought Klein because they're supposed to be high end. These were great for as long as they lasted, which wasn't long. Blades overlap and bite each other. Won't close. Was in the middle of rewiring my garage when they suddenly went kaput in my hand. I did nothing to cause the problem."
5,Excellent Research,"I bought this book just a few years after it came out. And being a devoted & life long fan of TAG Show I have to say this is the most thorough, fact-based and well-researched of them all. It has tibits that most books are lacking with conversations from the cast and little back story notes from even characters such as ""Howard"", ""Otis, ""Gomer and Goober"" and of course Floyd the Barber. It has the entire script of one show as well as episode numbers, dates they aired but the best parts are the history of the show, how each character got on the show, little-known facts about each and funny notes of behind the scenes. If you love TAG Show you MUST add this one to your collection. It by far is the most complete and it's well- written with pictures and more..."
1,Too many errors in the episode reviews,"I have the first issue of this book from 1981 and just started paying more attention to the reviews written in the back of the book for each episode. There are so many errors in the storylines; I have red-lined and re-written them so many times I've lost count. Check out the writeups on ""The Bed Jacket"", ""Aunt Bee, the Swinger"", ""TV or not TV"", ""Off To Hollywood"", ""The Hollywood Party"", ""Aunt Bee Takes a Job"", and ""Opie Steps Up In Class"". All have at least one to several errors in the synopsis. How could someone claim to have watched these episodes? Skip this book. I'm looking for another one. (To give the writer the benefit of the doubt, maybe later versions of the book corrected these errors?)"
2,disappointing tribute to my favorite show,"I love The Andy Griffith Show, and only want to read books on my favorite show written by authors who love it with the same enthusiasm as I feel. This book read like a term paper -- the writing dry and tedious. The only chapter of real interest? -- one containing the complete script of ""Man in a Hurry"" just as the actors saw it, and then another script that was never filmed for some unknown reason.There must be other better tributes to this show. Bypass this one and keep looking."
3,"Not bad, but...","Not bad, but it could of been better. It's hard to read at times. If you already own other books on TAGS, but need a Mayberry fix, then I would buy it. If you don't already own any TAGS books, I reccomend ""Inside Mayberry"" instead."
3,"Too much other stuff, Not enough Exam help",I felt that the majority of the book was just explaining things other than 911 Operator Examinations. I was about half way through before I found anything useful.
3,Opinion Dispatcher,"Generally good information; specifically not real close to the testing I went through. However, I would recommend."
3,California Car Duster Water Blade,"This item does a decent job removing water, but I can't help wondering if it would be more efficient if the blade was a little less flexible. The blade is very flexible, almost to the point of being flimsy. Before you buy, I would check out other brands at a local store."
4,I Missed Jaylin in This Book!!,"This is my least favorite of the Naughty Series; it didn't have enough umph like the previous books and the ones after this one. Jaylin only had ONE chapter in the entire book, and I wasn't interested in Scorpio and Shane's relationship for some reason. Toward the end is where it got REALLY interesting!!!Overall rating: 3.75"
4,Rivet tool.,"I have only used it one time so far, but it worked fine and should last a long, long time."
1,Tool Failed first time it was used,Not too much detail since it only lasted one rivet before it jammed. Seems too light weight for larger rivets. Have always liked Stanley tools but not this time.
2,"No longer ""Made in USA""","Just received this item today, and was quite disappointed with the ""Made in TAIWAN"" on the package. Have yet to use it, but Amazon.com needs to get their description correct. Time will tell if it holds up."
1,NOT as pictured,"I purchased this ""doodle pad"" for someone who likes to scribble while on the phone. As pictured and described it seemed like a great gift. Unfortunately, I should have been weary of the product name - ""Pro/Con"" - as that was what came in the mail. An ugly pea green color with two columns for, you guessed it, pros and cons about a situation.This seller needs to update their product information so that it accurately details that which they are selling."
1,An intellectual projection of and on Mother Meera.,"The first two chapters of this book are quite well done. Martin gives a good intellectual appraisal of Mother Meera, and says a lot of the right things, but I think he misses the deeper message. He makes many personal judgements about Mother that reflect an undercurrent of his own agenda and personal disatisfaction despite the attempt he says he made to ""edit out his anger"". He also trivializes her development to be largely the result of a manipulative uncle. I guess that is his perogative as an author, but it casts an unfair shadow on this woman's incredible talent and free offering of Love to the world. I left this book feeling subtly manipulated by Martins personal agenda that he has projected on Mother Meera. I would not recommend reading this book, other than the first two chapters or at least not until someone has already had the opportunity to experience being in her presence."
5,love it,It is such a classic and it was just what I wanted as a gift for my son-in-law. It is perfect! Thanks for having it available!
4,Sound blaster- exact replacement,"needed a replacement sound card for a Dell computer and this was it. It accomodates up to 7 speakers and projects awesome sound. The seller, well he was most thorough. He put his phone number all over the paperwork stating that if you have any problem with the installation to give him a call. I had no problems but was ready to dial him if there was a hitch."
2,Great sound but drivers and applications are a nightmare/buggy,"I would not recommend unless you are a hardcore computer professional who knows how to workaround this fix.They got a great sound card, but the application was written by third grade s/w team.It is so buggy.When you install this applications, please choose Analog as default, as otherwise you won't hear sound from the speakers.Most of the time volume control will not show up on the taskbar. It took me a couple days to fix the s/w and drivers. Creative support is a joke.I had a Turtle beach Santa Cruz and I never had a single issue so far. It was only supporting 5.1 but otherwise setup was so easy. Definitely would have rated higher except for the s/w applications. Otherwise, the sound is awesome."
2,Piece of JUNK,the optical output only does 2.1 sound. If you want 5.1 to 7.1 sound then you have to use analog plugs on the back. Don't waste your money.
5,Incredible,"Incredible sound, great features. Oh man, where to start. First off it is 7.1, 6.1, and 5.1 compatible I use 7.1 with the Creative Inspire T7700 speakers and it is amazing the difference you can hear in games. Also 24-bit audio, which can improve the quality of even regular 16-bit songs. It has every audio technology available, more than your home theater or ampliphier probably. DTS-ES, Dolby Digital-EX, THX, EAX, as well as a zillion software programs, and possible configurations and settings (you can make it sound like your in a cave or a concert hall, or add karaoke, what ever you want). This sound card is also essential for recordings. And for only $90 you'd be crazy not to allow yourself a little luxary for your pc experience."
2,Horrible Product,"I agree with Ken on this totally. I have 15 years of sys admin work under my belt and by far this was the hardest install of my entire life.Last time I called for support it was for a raid array failing, this was just a simple install of hardware. Support could not help me after two hours of talking with their ""experts"". The final resort was to reformat my machine. Granted I needed to anyway, but still had massive issues with installing it. I ended up with just installing this with DRIVERS only, since the software was error-ing out constantly.To boot it does not work with my power Mac on the way :(If you are not technically savvy, this is not the card for you."
2,Why?,"This CD/DVD release seems to think that having one be really good will make up for the other being really bad. Well, it fails because both don't turn out all that good. Don't get me wrong, I've been a 'lo for a years, but the CD only has one good track (the last one).The DVD is a little better does have some music videos to a few of his other songs, they're nothing really all that special, and most of it is just film from GOTJ 2004. In between them are these skits that just aren't really anything to pay money for. Save your money, this is something you don't have to buy to stay a die-hard fan."
5,WOW,"I enjoy listening to the Cozad singers. They bring out the best in the Gourd Dance music. They know how to honor the American Veterans with their traditional Gourd Dance music. When playing this CD, it just wants to make you get up and begin dancing. Hard to keep the feet still."
2,Not for me...,"I took it because my cousin recommended it to me, but this thing has me alert like crazy. I only took one during the day and it wouldn't let me sleep. I tried it for 4 days and i gave up... maybe for someone else."
5,Feeling good,I feel so much better now that I'm taking these vitamins. No funky tastes or side effects two thumbs way up.
2,Disappointed,"As a person who suffers a fatigue syndrome and an autoimmune disease, I was excited to see so many reviews on how these vitamins gave people great energy! Even though I knew it wouldn't make me top shape, I thought it would give me a little edge on my day. How wrong was I! First, the pills made me sick to my stomach. I tried taking them at various points in the day, still had the same results. Second, the vitamins made me sleepier than before! I found myself after a 8 hour night of sleep needing a 2-3 hour nap after taking these pills. That's very bizarre and not helpful in the least. Thirdly, these pills made me eat like eating was going out of fashion. I only stayed on these for a month and then went back to One-a-day. These side-effects had me thinking I was pregnant, and that's not cool! The only reason they didn't get just one star is because they did help my nails grow."
3,Worth viewing from a historical perspective...,If not necessarily for dramatic value. Although the story is certainly a compelling one the film is incredibly predictable. What is worth noting however are the racial attitudes that existed for all negroes regardless of skin tone by both white and colored people at that time.
2,Never enough air in it! Bad buy.,"It's never completely filled with air. It's always loose, even looser after one night. I also had to replace the pump and got a better one for $[...] instead of the replacement they sell for $[...]. Definetly overpriced and bad quality. The concept is great though, you don't have to carry the bulky pack and play and the sides are high enough to block my daughter from falling off."
1,High pressure hose connection,"I own a Karcher 3000 G pressure washer. One of the big concerns I recommend customers check prior to purchasing any pressure washer is the method used for connecting the High Pressure hose to the Pump discharge. On my Karcher 3000 G this connection is very POOR. I can not get a tight fit even after having the repair shop (recommended by Karcher) look at it. This loose fit, causes the high pressure water to leak at the joint and you can not get the full high pressure effect."
2,Phish are circling the drain......,Not a very good concert. Beginning was horriable.....got a little better near the end. Overall I can't believe they released this DVD. I'm very disappointed in how they sounded. I thought they were a jam band!
4,Very Good,"I purchased it about a year and half ago. It still does the job. However, I recently noticed that the duster does not work as well as in the beginning."
1,Sixguns by Keith is the one book on handguns you should own,"Sixguns by KeithThis book is an American classic.If you want a book which tells you all about handguns,this is the book to buy. It is the seminal book abouthunting with a handgun. It also contains sectons aboutselection of a handgun, handloading, trick shooting,long range shooting and the use of handguns as a defensiveweapon.This book is a classic. Some might call it dated, as itwas written before world war two, and updated by the authorin the post world war two era after he gained experiencewith the .44 magnum in the field. It is the most completebook available on handgun hunting and handguns in general.What it does not contain. This book does not cover recentdevelopments in combat handgunnery or silouette shooting.Nonetheless, it is the best book available on the generalsubject of handguns and the use of handguns.If you are only going to buy one book on this subject,this is the book to buy."
2,Core pillow cover,It's nice having a cover that I can clean. But the cover has 2 seams lengthwise that I don't like to put my face on. I wish it only had 1 seam like a regular pillowcase.
4,"Good stuff, but come on...look at the cast!","...with Christopher Nolan at the helm, and all these Oscar winners roaming around amazing outdoor vistas, involved in a twisty murder mystery. It just couldn't suck....It's a very well-done thriller, with some stuff you've seen a million times (but you don't care because it's THAT well-done) and some stuff that will have even the most jaded viewers perking up their collective eyebrows in surprise.It's way too early to tell if this is one of the five best films of the year, but it's excellent filmmaking all the way around, and well worth a perusal."
3,Great Start......Fizzled at the END!,"This movie was so compelling in the begining. The plot for the first hour and a half and acting were excellent. Al Pacino is excellent as usual. Excellent cinematography and boy it really grabs you; However, all that build up and the ending was so predictable. My guest and I were saying, ""What the heck was that"". When the credit rolled we were sitting there with our mouths open. Was that it? Did we miss something? All that great acting and that ending? It is worth seeing simply because Al Pacino and Robin Williams are in it. I give it 3 stars for the cast and cinematography."
