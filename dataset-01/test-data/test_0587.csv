4,all fans must buy,Many guest stars revealed- not like the L.P. That's the way it was back then-even though we knew friend Clapton and Starr was involved-did you know that Frampton stopped by and played guitar on many tracks-(not mentioned)heard from Frampton in a recent interview-but now we know Ginger Baker was in one of the jam sessions. Embrace what George couldn't release with the Beatles. Not to forget Gary Brooker-from Procol Harum and Dave mason from Traffic.
2,Not a fan of the Three Stooges,"I ordered this comedy for my mother who is 90 and homebound but it is not to our taste. My brothers were great fans of the Three Stooges so I gave the DVDto one of them. Truthfully, I didn't watch all of it but what I observed seemed to me amateurish. Their slapstick seems a bit rough, although I understand that this is their appeal and I think only one of the three is a good comic actor. I prefer Laurel and Hardy. I know I took a chance buying this DVD so I fault no one but oneself for the choice.Charlotte Fasi"
4,Takes Me Back To My Childhood,"I've been watching this set an episode or two at a time since I bought it, and I've gotta say it's brought a smile to my face each time. Yes the show is a bit dated, but it's sweet and good family entertainment.It's great to see the shows intact, with such great sound and picture quality ( also glad to see the episodes with the original first season theme, as they originally aired! ) My one real gripe is that the final episode, ""Knight In Shining Armor"" is actually missing the end tag segment, which was included on the commercially released VHS version. In this the two guest characters pack up and head out ( to a short lived spin-off called ""Getting Together"" ), while Reuben Kincaid wistfully tells the Partridges that he ""envies"" them the adventures that lie ahead for them. You needn't fret Reuben...you got the better end of the deal.Despite that one glaring ommision, I am delighted with this set and am looking forward to more."
3,"Great shows, but last episode is incomplete.","The last episode, the one with Bobby Sherman, is missing the tag at the end: The scene where Bobby and Lionel say goodbye to the Partridges and Reuben and head off to L.A., and Reuben says, ""I wish I were them.""Also, some of the scenes are blurry and the color is weak.How could Sony have goofed up so badly?"
2,NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I knew it was eventually going to come to DVD, but nothing could have prepared me for when I finally saw this in the store. I hated this show as a kid and can't even watch it with nostalgia. Danny Partridge was the ugliest little smart arse ever to be put in front of the camera. Everytime I saw him I just wanted to beat him up. Watching him play his bass guitar like it was a six-string just made me wince all the more.The show was totally unbelievable, the characters inane, and the stories were borderline insanity. I'll never forget the episode with Richard Pryor. The Partridge van breaks down in the ghetto or something and they run into a club owner who's trying to save his club. Make a long story short, The Partridges perform for a bunch of 70's style pimps and gangstas, and at the end Danny is an honorary Black Panther complete with beret!This was not good television no matter how you look at it."
4,A soundtrack that sets the mood of the holocaust,"Schindler's List is a different kind of movie that you would expect from Steven Spielberg. So is the soundtrack. John Williams really did a great job. If you have soundtracks from him like Star Wars or Jurassic Park you will find Schindler's List very different. The music really suits the tragedy of World War II. As a soundtrack its quite depressing . Its music you could use on a funeral. Don't get me wrong, the soundtrack is good. But sad."
5,the best score i own!!!,The minute i got this cd i put it into my cd player and was deeply moved by this score. The violin solos are brilliant!!! Track 8 captures the horror of the concentration camps. This score deserves more than just an academy award. A true work of art by john willaims!!!
3,Good but dreary,I bought this CD right after seeing the movie and loved it. That was years ago. I just dug it out and played it againand now it sounds incredibly dreary to me. It's just too depressing even though there are a couple of nice melodies.
2,comes off your belt,I have two Ericsson brand cases (horizontal too). All of their cases use a belt clip which is not secure and can easily come off. Their clips do not have the part that hooks back up to prevent it from lifting off the belt. Other Ericsson non-OEM clips are much more secure.I use it as a protective case to keep the flip closed when I carry it in my briefcase. The leather is nice.
1,An Inconvenient Truth,"The product is not the problem - just dealing with the vendor. Any necessary returns are difficult. Shipping was inflated at $15 UPS, but it cost me $9.00 UPS to return. After a restocking fee of 20%, a $100 purchase cost $65. in just handling and shipping, and the vendor will re-sell the item. Futhermore it may take six weeks for them to credit the return?? MY ADVICE BUY LOCAL - where a return is handled as good will and much, much simplier."
4,Polk Audio Atrium 45,"Overall, the speakers work great. The bass response is a little low, but not unexpected for the size of the speakers. These speakers have endured some heavy thunderstorms while installed in exposed conditions on my deck railing but are still working as well as the day they arrived."
5,Great Speakers Even Better Price,"This speaker sounds fantastic! I have them installed below my second floor eave and they sound absolutely terrific on my patio below. The sound is so full and rich, you would think you were sitting in your family room listening. I would definately recommend these to anyone looking for a great pair of speakers that won't break the bank."
3,Just OK,"Nothing wrong with these speakers... well made and easy to install. Amazon had best price. But, I should have explored more alternatives. For the same money I could have bought a pair of outdoor speakers with a larger woofer. The base definitely gets lost with these."
4,Great Clarity but no Boom,I've had them now for over 3 weeks and I must say they sound great. The clarity of the highs and mids is impressive if kept at a reasonable volume. They are however lacking in bass and start to sound distorted at higher volumes. They were mounted in the corners of my deck which is 9 feet above ground. A second set may be needed for the ground level when I have a party or cookout.
5,"GREAT CD! And, I'm really picky.","I had never heard of these guys before, but I heard it on KCRW and decided to check it out. ""Always Thought The Sun Would Shine"" is my new favorite song, this CD is one of those that just stays with me. I'm usually pretty particular about my music, especially when it comes to electronica, I don't buy a lot of music unless it comes highly recommended or it really moves me. I found some other stuff on iTunes, but no other Cds, i guess they only have one."
5,Excellent Production,"This is an excellent version of evita. I prefer julie covington and colm wilkinson to patti lupone and mandy patinkin. Julie to me sounds like a natural evita and colm does a great job; he has an edge to his voice that patinkin most assuredly does not. The only problem is this a 1976 recording and does not have the clarity high fidelity of a modern recording, I definently prefer the sound of the movie version even though madonna isn't a world class singer"
2,Disappointed,"I was really excited when I found this pan but when I make brownies in it, the batter leaks out and seals the two pieces together. It makes it really difficult to get the pan to open and I pulled too hard and ruined the spring part. Now I can't use it any more because it won't tighten. I don't know of another brand that makes this type of pan."
5,same as always,"what can you say about diapers. they work, they absorb, they fit, they are the right size, give it up!"
4,Excellent-absorbent-price is right,"At first we didn't like these for my mother who's had a long recovery from surgery. The size seemed too big. But turns out these are loose fitting, allowing her skin to breathe. And they still provide all the needed leakage protection. Good product, great price, free shipping."
5,Great city bike !,Delivery was prompt and within one week.Putting it togethjer took 15 minutes.Best bike I've had sofar !
1,JUNK BIKE,"This is a junk department store bike. IT IS NOT A REAL MONGOOSE! This is a HUFFY w/the Mongoose Name! (Huffy baught out Mongoose! I didn't know this when I purchased it, and I was a fool to trust the Mongoose name) You can go to K-Mart or Target and purchase the same thing for $79.95!"
3,rider,The bike seems very loose. The brakes are hard to adjust. I do not like the way you have to change speeds
4,A good book to aquaint yourself with non-linear writing.,"To understand the workings of the human Id, it is nessecary to first deny it. This book is an introduction into how they were doing it. I strongly recommend that anyone interested in the literary happenings of the Beat generation should have this book as a launching point for further investigation. If you read it, there will most certainly be further investigation."
4,"love the cd, but ...","I love every song in this CD. However, I don't think that MCA (the label company) gave this CD the kind of loving care that Louis Armstrong deserves. There is a noticeable drop in volume starting at Mack the Knife, giving the impression that MCA was doing a hasty cut and paste job for a quick buck. In spite of that, the individual selection is very good."
5,Smiles and Tears: Perfect Introducton to Jazz,"Louis Armstrong brought such emotions to my music collection. My, a child grew up on rap, fell in love with and old dead man and his beautiful songs. He introducted me to jazz music and expanded my horizons.That was three years ago. I now am a jazz fanatic. Louis brought my jazz life out of the womb. This ablum lacks the great early jazz recorded by Satchmo and some increditable duets with Ella Fitsgerald and many more. But one CD can only be so long and like I said a perfect introduction to jazz music specifically Louis Armstrong. God Bless and RIP."
4,action packed,"i liked the action sequences, and explosion parts of the movie. I definitely would recommend it to anyone that likes action movies"
3,Typical good guys vs. bad guys movie,"This is a typical and predictable good guys vs. bad guys movie. However, I enjoyed watching all the ""mature"" action movie actors one more time."
3,Fun for what it's worth,"This is one of those (as I call them) ""popcorn flicks"". I had a good time during the viewing but at the end, thought, ""That was a little like cotton candy...sweet but has all the nutrition of sand""."
3,fun watch,"Certainly not an epic film, but fun to watch... The corniness is good enough for a laugh and the explosions are loud and choke full of great action. It is great that these guys can laugh at and with themselves. Funtimes for all."
4,Fun,A good movie for action junkies. It was fun to see all the action stars in one movie reviving their old movie tag lines.
3,Exactly what you expect,"If you grew up on watching these guys movies, you will love it, if not you will be watching a 2 hour action movie."
2,I really wanted to like this movie,"No matter how hard I tried, I could not find enough substance in this movie to like it.Chuck Norris and Arnold both moved around like they were stiff old boards.The writing was terrible.The action scenes were very generic.I cannot recommend this movie to anyone unless your a super super hard core fanof a few of the actors in the movie."
3,Action Heros Everywhere,"What happens when you put every major name together in a single movie? Nothing !! The story line is obviously designed to develop a bullets per minute mentality. The flying scenes are un-realistic. The sniper shooting is pretty incredible in a couple of scenes. Overall, a mindless 2 hours with lots of action. Storyline is not very good."
2,No thanks.,Too much blood splattering for my taste. Only made it through the first 18 minutes. Like several of the cast members.
4,Good dumb fun,"I have no expectations for the Expendables series since it is mostly a chance to rehash old cliches and see the heroes I grew to love as a kid. I mean Chuck Norris the one man army! great! The quality was pretty good, but don't go in thinking the plot and the dialogue as predictable. Just take it as pure action packed fun!"
1,Really awful,"I like almost all movies...but this one falls so low on the dreadful waste of time and life scale it's not funny. Speaking of not funny, this movie certainly wasn't. There was just a lot of blowing people up and an all star cast of once great action actors who had no storyline or plot worth having to work with. My husband wanted to turn it off halfway through but since I had paid to rent it I wouldn't let him. But advice for others...even if this was available for free don't bother."
1,Gun Porn...,"Written, Directed and Produced with a 14 year old as its target audiance. Or maybe just adults with 14 year old mentalities. I feel ripped off watching this."
5,What an action movie should be,"Wanted more Jet Li though. Even though I rated this one 5 stars, the original was a little better. But the one-liners and over the top ""acting"" was enjoyable."
1,Weak,"Very lame, was completely disappointed. No actual substance, just a movie of cameos. Thought it would at least be decent like the first one or A-Team...rent something else!"
5,DVDs ar always a hit,"My Daughter loves movies and this is one she requested. She was very happy to recieve it when she opened it,"
5,Expendables 2,"Fast service,Fast delivery,great movie I would recommend this movie to everyone.Great action movie! If you liked the first one you will love this one."
4,Cheezy,"It was what i expected it to be, but honestly better than the first one. I enjoyed the movie. It met my expectations."
2,Expendable,Except for a few funny lines this movie was terrible. Save your money and time and see something another movie.
4,Fun to Watch-Quick moving,"I found this movie rather predicatable, but there are great comedic scenes throughout. Some of the lines are rather corney, but if you like the genre there are great laughs to be had."
4,Not bad,"Pretty exciting, some funny moments. It is good to see all the old fellas on screen again. Excessively high body count."
2,yowzaa,"Not very good. A bunch of over the hill action movie actors helping the unfortunates of the world. Surprised they made a sequal to first one, even more surprised i was bored enough to rent it!"
2,Didn't like it at all,"To be fair, I have to say that we only made it through... maybe 15 minutes? But, it was all we could take. Maybe it got better.Unfortunately, at that time we were like ""who even cares!"""
2,Boom,If you like to see things blown up then this is the movie for you.Story line would have been alright but most of the dialogue was lame.Arnold looked bad and acting was even worse.Stallone and rest of castdid a decent job with the bad lines they were given.
3,Expended,"not as good a first one not enough of a story, just fighting. Need to have again more of a story line,"
4,Exciting follow-up,I really enjoyed the first Expendables and was very excited to see that a second one was coming out. I was every bit as impressed with the second one as I had been with the first. Pick this one up.
2,no where as good as the first.,quirky cliches and overdone action sequences cannot support unqualified total acceptance of the need for this level of cinematic endeavor
1,I only watched it cuz im a van damme fan.,The story is cheesy. Huge spoiler Stallone could not beat van damme ever. He defeats him in the end so simple it made me turn this piece of crap off. They gave them the shortest fight scene. I also expect Jackie Chan instead of jet Li. I only watched it cuz I grew up on van damme movies and Bruce lee. So i just expected a super fight in the end.
1,Maybe the Dumbest Movie Ever,"Just finished Expendables 2. I think this just may be the dumbest movie I have ever seen.Not only that but it is just horrible. The only good things about the movie are Van Dammeand Scott Adkins. The movie tries way to hard with the inside jokes and trying to giveeverybody their little catch phrases and stupid comments. And really that is all this movieis. The story is horrible, juvenile and pathetic."
3,Really?!,"The first one was bad enough..., boy I guess the actors are having a lot of fun, b/c I can't see how they can afford to pay'em!!"
1,overrated,Once again the good ol boy club found a way for everyone with nothing to do during the week to show up and get a paycheck and screen time with little or no effort required. What a waste of computer generated effects. Chuck Norris was the only one who showed up ready to work and earn his pay it seemed. Lots of loud noises and scenery destruction do not a movie make!
3,Somewhat Weak,I would have expected this movie to be better than it was with all of the well known actors in it. The story line was somewhat weak.
5,Expendables 2,Didn't like as much as part 1 but it was good. Anything with all those hunks has got to be good.
3,Fun light escape movie,"fun light escape movie for the holidays and long weekendsespecially with Arnold, Chuck and Bruce.better than the first movie"
4,met expectations,a little crazier the the original but still fun to watch. will surely add to wife's collection of action adventures.
5,Bad guys make squishy noise when they die... alot,"This is a guilty pleasure film. The plot is simple, but the bad guys are bad, the heroes are accurate and well-armed, and getting the old gang together is fun. Don't quibble about ammo counts, physics or the bad guys accuracy (those guys don't practice anyway). This movie is about having the good guys be great. Get some pop corn, a beverage of your choice and enjoy.My wife, who usually hates these types of movies, gave it a 7 / 10 stars. That is pretty high praise from her."
2,Not worth it,The first Expendables was enjoyable if cheesy. This one had the plot and special effects of a bad made-for-tv movie. It is not worth paying for.
2,Don't Waste Your Time,It was sad to watch all these action stars end up in this washing machine movie. Stupid of me to expect anymore.
3,One Step Back,"The set of my favorite actors is complete in this movie with the participation of Schwarzenegger, Willis, and Chuck Norris, no wait... Clint and Liam are also my favorites, but who knows, maybe in the next movie.Good come-back of Van Damme who is been absent from the screen in the US for a while. The plot is a simple one. Go in and avenge the dead friend and beat the bad guys in the meantime. Can't comment on acting they are all good, they're all first class professionals. ... Maybe you can add Christian Bale too, but not as Batman, though! What I mean with all this is that I liket this movie and if you have the chance to watched, please do so."
3,very predictable,"what else can I say?? 15 more words are required. to hell with brevity, huh? must be an idea shared with the producers."
3,This one is ok but I liked the first one better,I loved the first one and this one is OK/Good I likes the comedy quips that came from everybody and I especially loved the tongue in cheek making fun of themselves and previous characters. I like it well enough to not be sorry I bought it.
2,lame,I don't know if I can write enough to meet the required number of words. It was a sad waste of time.
1,Waste of time,"Not worth it. Even for action die hards, it leaves quite a bit to be desired. Plot is extremely predictable and even the cliches are lame."
3,Lots of Action. Lots of overkill.,"Nothing like a bunch of old, over the hill has been heroes making their last hurrah (hopefully). Thank goodness for superior make-up artists and computerized enhancements. About the only one who appears to have aged gracefully is Chuck Norris. It is amazing at how the bad guys often can't hit anything while the heroes never miss. Having gotten the negatives, more or less, out of the way, some positives. Kind of turns into a ""Magnificent Seven"" with the heroes setting out to save a village, and those under the heel of a despot. As long as you don't take it seriously, it is an entertaining film, with a lot of one liners resurrected from the heroes' past rolls. The younger set will especially love its nonstop action, pyrotechnics, and special effects, and of course the good guys win in the end."
3,Same thing....,"It's exactly as the last movie, a lot of people killing other people. Old guys trying to remember when they were young... is not bad, but there are better options..."
4,Not too bad a spoof,If you like spoof movies that aren't slapstick and can stand stalone. I think this is o.k. Man these guys are way too old for serious action flicks.
3,As long as you don't expect much....,"then you will enjoy the action and adventure. Old guys shooting it up-Arnold, Bruce, Sly, etc.- It's fun and no thinking is required."
3,Movie is Expendable,"This movie is just okay. I didn't see part 1, so the cast of former movie & tv heroes was the most interesting part for me. It had few funny lines."
4,very good show,"Expendables 2 I think was better than the first one it starts out fast and stays that way,it does slow down for a bit but if you are an action adventure fan like I am than its a must see."
2,Love movie hate the service,The DVD was shipped late then was out of stock then when it came the DVD was scratched up so I can see the first 10 min or so I bought something new waited a long time when I could of gotten it at a store quicker. The movie is good from what I saw.
1,Worst than the 1st!,"Where to start??? Horrible acting, bad CGI(gunshots, explosions, etc), it's neverending. Jean Claude VD looks like he just got out of plastic surgery when he finally takes off his sunglasses."
2,Don't bother,Did not enjoy ot as much as the forst one. This one was cornier and did not need Bruce or Arnold in it.
2,Corny and lacking a good story line,"With all these actors, one would think this would be a good movie, but sadly it was bad. The graphics were good, the tecnotronics were good, but the overall story was lack luster"
3,"Hmm yep ok, not so great","The movie had an excellent cast, but had a cheesy movie plot with cheesy lines :( Could have been much better."
2,NO... No.,Let's get a bunch of high profile actors who can't act together and make a movie that only meat heads will enjoy. You know? Those stupid people at the gym who scream everytime they curl a dumbell.
2,bait and switch,"The draw to this film is the cast...all the greats of action flicks. However, Bruce Willis is but a few brief minutes in the story, and then disappears. Jason Stratham is his usual best in any film he participates in. Dolph Lundgren is genuinely repulsive, both in character and non-acting ability. The biggest downer is to see Sly Stallone....at all. He was engaging in his early action films....ASSASINS, GET CARTER, the ROCKY franchise,and he somehow survived such material as the ""clifff"" movie with John Lithgow who stole the show, as he is wont to do.Here, in the EXPENDABLES IS TRULY IS THAT...EXPENDABLE...!!! His body hardly looks made for heaving around as he wants us to believe he can(not)...His mumbling has become disconcerting. His facial expressions are missing. It was a bitter disappointment"
2,"All the elements, but poor execution","With an action cast as magnificent as they had in this film, and obviously high budget, there is literally no excuse why every scene shouldn't kick major ass and leave you totally satisfied. Unfortunately the opposite happened-- Every scene seemed to zoom by, without any truly ""cinematic"" moments that are memorable. Every amazing introduction of each new character was less than lackluster, and the action wasn't anything that we haven't seen before.To have Jean Claude VanDamme as the bad guy was the coolest thing ever, and the actual movie failed to live up to that premise.As a side note, I'm also really tired of looking at CG blood explosions. It looks fake, it's always over the top, and never adds to the scene. The action giants in this film came up in an era of real pyrotechnics and squibs, and the action in those films is still better."
4,"Action, action, action",Great action from begining to end. I liked seeing all my favorite action heroes in one place.Worth watching again.
3,The Expendables Movies Are Hereby Expended,"I don't know, maybe I missed the point of the movie. I caught the referrals to past movies for all of the guys (whatever). The movie just didn't have the oomph that all of these guys have given in other movies. Maybe I'm expecting to much. I know they still have it. I am going to blame it on the plot and the story line. Because they are all awesome actors."
3,No Oscar but Plenty of Sly,"If you are in the mood to watch mindless explosions, awesome stunts, and rampage then this move is right for you. These movies will never win an Oscar and that is Okay! It will provide substantial entertainment and give you a good return on your craving for action. Kids have ""The Avengers"" and the older generation has ""The Expendables"". So sit back and set your mind to cruise control."
3,Just OK,"Hey, it is a dumb blood and guts movie. A way to kill time. Lots of stuff that did not make sense."
3,3 for film; 5 for 1 star comments,"No surprises here, a decent action film with guys seeming to have aged even more from the first flick to this one. The good news is Rourke's not here to cry for us. The bad news is Li's only in it for a minute or so. However, though it certainly is not a 5 star movie, if you're browsing reviews, go to the 1 star section. Many of the comments there are laugh-out-loud hilarious and will repay you for any time you thought you lost watching Sly and ""The Little Rascals,"" as Bruce Willis called them in the film's funniest line."
4,the expendables 2,could not use digital copy not for use out side of states. had to chase up muliti region player but was worth it.
4,Awesome,"Great blow them up movie. Don't need to think. Good guys win, rockin weapons and great one liners. Just a fun guy movie!"
4,Cosmetic organizer- good idea,My wife loved this organizer. She uses it for all her make up bits and pieces and says that it makes life a lot easier than having to search through her make up bag.
2,Sqeaks,"I have been through 4 sets of wipers in an attempt not to pay the exorbitant cost of Porsche OEM replacement products. But I think in this instance it's pennywise pound foolish. None of the wipers I've tried so far are a patch on the original Porsche wipers. These ones are one of the best for cleaning the screen, but have annoying squeak when they change direction. It's off to the dealership to part with 75 bucks.."
4,"Tata Vega ""Try My Love"" tracks/songs from album","(A1) Come On And Try My Love,---(A2) Need You Now,---(A3) Get It Up For Love,---(A4) If Love Must Go,---(A5) Magic Feeling,---(B1) Gonna Do My Best To Love You,---(B2) I Just Keep Thinking About You Baby,---(B3)Whopper Bopper Show Stopper,---(B4) In The Morning."
5,Great Speakers at Amazing Value,These speakers are perfect for outdoors and has much better performance than I expected. What I read/heard from other reviewers is true.It has very good volume and bass response.
4,Good solid speakers,"I put these speakers in an outdoor pool area. The mounting brackets are solid and allow you to rotate the speakers for the optimal listening position.I'm not an audio expert but the sound quality and construction are decent and certainly worth the price I paid ($110). I have indoor, floorstanding Polk speakers for my home theater. The fact that they have been great has led me to stick with Polk until it's proven to me that there is something better out there (at least in this price range)."
5,Awesome Speakers,"Installed on the outside of our barn to project sound to our riding ring. Crystal clear across 150 Feet! We'll see how well they weather the winter... because once you get them, the manual tells you to not have them outside despite the fact that they are 'all weather.'"
1,SHAME ON YOU!!!,"I love Sam & Max, A 5 STAR collection to be sure, and know for a fact that this collection is soon to be reissued. To those sellers who are charging UPWARDS OF $300 (?!!) for this little black and white 160 page book, YOU MAKE ME SICK! For that much money, I expect the book to be delivered to me in a frikkin' gold plated briefcase by an armed-to-the-teeth Secret Service agent. I HOPE YOU NEVER MAKE A DIME, you bottom-feeding nostalgia vampires."
5,Sounds Awesome,"I've had these hung up outside for two seasons now, They still sound great and look good too. Great sound for a great price."
2,It should have been much better,"I've just finished this book. On Ms.O'Donnell's other books, it felt like you're watching a movie...a good one. But reading Champion of the Heart felt like reading a movie script. Her words were not as flowing, not as captivating. Like driving on a bumpy road.For me;the plot is good,an interesting one actually. But this book couldn't capture me. The feelings was not as touched compare to her other works. It's a surprise to know that this was not her very first book. Care for a revised version Ms.O'Donnell? I still love all your characters and how you share their thoughts , their reasons and their feelings for us..readers..that we don't have to wonder.If anyone want to give a start on Ms.O'Donnell's books, I gladly recommend ""The Lady and the Falconer"". After that it's your choice to pursue."
3,just ok,My son loves veggie tales and we have movies in both english and spanish. The only thing I was unsatisfied with is that in each of the spanish veggie tales they use different people for the voices of the characters so in each movie the characters sound differnt. Even my 2 year old son recognized this. Other than that the movie itself was very cute and a good show for my son to watch with catchy songs.
1,buy something else,spend your money on something worth it. this product is cheap and the wood splinters and falls apart easlier. had to make repairs just to put it together...very disappointed with this product
2,Bowed Wood - Made it hard to put together.,The issue I did have with this is one of the pieces was bowed and made it hard to put together. The chair sits a little crooked because of this. I was disappointed about that.
2,"It would be great if they remembered to include the hardware! The price was ok, but as soon as I received it, the price doubled","Cute, pretty... and no hardware. The instructions for assembly were not good. Not good at all. But I like these little chairs. I'd buy many more to give as gifts... if the assembly instructions made sense and they included hardware!Odd. the price doubled as soon as I received mine. I had thought to purchase some more as plant stands. Yes, plant stands. They are charming. But I would not pay the new price"
5,Review - Monster Garage - Season One,Great episodes ! You can watch repeatedly and catch things you missed the first time ! Shipped promptly !
1,school bell,"PAY ATTENTION TO ALL THE REVIEWS!!!! I thought the review regarding the ugly bronze bell with the scrolls was just a fluke. NOT SO, I ordered the bell pictured that was black and didn't have scrolls however I received the ugly bronze bell with the hideous scrolls. Our reviews don't do the ugliness justice. What am I going to do with this hunk of ugly junk? I refuse to put it in my yard as I initially desired since it is so disgusting. I'll be damn, the $25.00 I had to pay for shipping to get it here if I'm going to pay another $25.00 to send it back. I'll have more in shipping than the cost of the bell. It's so ugly I wouldn't give it to my worst enemy as a wedding gift. BUYERS BE CAREFUL!!!!!!"
5,Good,It is a very nice and usefull battery. It lasts a long time. If you forget to charge one day you will have some battery left.
4,Whitman's War Poems,"The hard cover recommends this book, and the price is very reasonable. Whitman originally published his Civil War poems as DRUM TAPS and the Lincoln poems were quickly added for a version called DRUM TAPS AND SEQUEL. Yet, for price and content, I prefer the Dover paperback edition (THE CIVIL WAR POETRY AND PROSE of Walt Whitman) both because it is unbelievably inexpensive and because it includes Whitman's prose journal MEMORANDA DURING THE WAR. As another reviewer of this hardbound version observed, Robin Williams playing a teacher-on-rocket-fuel has little to do with Whitman's ""O Captain, My Captain,"" and Lord save us from teachers who allow students of the ""Lilacs"" poem to miss the point that it is a funeral dirge for Lincoln."
3,faulty product description,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this product. Whenever I leave the salon/spa they always put a cream on the waxed area to calm it. I bought this with that in mind.This product calms down the redness....no, it covers it up. Benzokal seems to be a toner. It is a tan color and it looks like automatic tanning lotion, so it coveres up the redness, it doesn't make it go away. I put too much on, so one side of my waxed area was very tan. Also, I put on white pajama pants afterwards and it rubbed off.Even though I was unhappy about it covering up redness, it did make my skin feel less irritated. It worked to cool and calm the skin.Gigi's product description doesn't say that this product is tinted and will cover up redness...that's what it does."
4,extremely high shipping charge,"I was shocked by the fact that I was charged an extremely high shipping cost for this product (tape, emboss, 3/8 x 144, RL, BK). Shipping costs amounted to many times the price of the product itself.Shipper could have mailed the product in a 44-cents mailer instead of charging almost 10 dollars......What a shame!!!!!!"
1,Bad Shipment,I have been receiveing Prevail for probably a year or more and never had a problem but this shipment was awful. They stuck together the padding was bad. I kept thinking maybe it was just a pack or two but the whole boxwas that way. I am going to try one more shipment to see if this was just a defective box. I am sorry to say they were so bad but they were. Carol Woolsey
5,Buy these. They work well and you can pretend to be a bear.,"Bought these as more of a joke for my wife. Ended up using them to gather the leaves this year and they work way better than I expected. One area of concern is the sharpness of the edge and the pointedness of the teeth, but keep the kids away from them and you should be good."
5,Fantastic,"Heaps of leaves and pine needles cleared in a short time. Use a rake to make piles of leaves and such. Use a tarp and the ""Claws"" to tidy up. Tarp is very useful to carry lightweight yard waste, carries more stuff (than pushing it in a wheel barrow)."
5,Gardex Hand Poly Leaf Scoop,Totally love this item. These have helped cut my chore time in half. The price was right. The feel of the items while using them is comfortable and very easy to use. Would make a great gift for anyone who loves working in the yard.
4,"Leaf scoops aka my ""big"" hands!","My neighbor has a pair of these which were purchased years ago. Every year, we borrow them to make our leaf bagging go quickly. The neighbor is moving so I had to find these fast! Once I knew what to call them :-) they were easy to find on Amazon, they came quickly and were put to immediate, hard use! I was able to fill 16 bags of leaves (live oak) in half the typical time.If you have to bag leaves, I highly recommend using these!"
5,A good book to help you code numerical methods in MATLAB,"I use this book. It is very short, but well written.If you want to learn numerical methods - Use Burden & Faires.But this book is for the end - user of the MATLAB numerical methods. It also gives some background info on these methods."
3,"Powerful research findings, but not a readable narrative","Packed with enlightening information and research that many teachers and scholars have cited, but it isn't very readable. It really is a compendium of the research, not a narrative to read. If you are looking for powerful research, statistics, and facts to back up your reading teaching practices, this is for you. If you simply want to read a narrative about reading practices in the classroom, this is not it. (Try Readicide by Kelly Gallagher or The Book Whisper by Donalyn Miller)."
2,kinda silly.,"I watched this movie hoping to be both captivated and repelled by the pure-evil-Oliver-Reed. I was more repelled, I gotta say. It was very soap opera, forced emotions, silly plot. Nice cinematography though. The end is so patently ridiculous. If you want a yawn and big laugh at the end, check this one out."
1,POOR SERVICE!,I ordered an item from this company 3 weeks ago and it still has yet to arrive. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!
2,downhill Dawson...,"season 5 had its good and bad moments. the tragedy in the Leery household was good drama; whereas the episode with Joey getting mugged was w/o question one of the worst moments in TV history. the writers really sucked it up. first off, after two years of Joey/Pacey drama they suddenly acted like they never even dated. the Dawson/Jen hookup was just plain bizarre,disarming and out of nowhere. instead of taking time to develop plot devices they just threw them out there with no justification or rational. poor Pacey also seemed largely absent, literally and figuratively from all things compelling or interesting.for me, Dawson's Creek jumped shark this season and didn't regain its footing until the second half of season 6. perhaps they should have Mike and the bots from Mystery Science Theater 3000 do the commentary for the mugging episode!"
2,Spread Too Thin,"I must admit that I had high hopes for this book, but in the end it was a letdown. The book spreads itself too thin and thus results in users with a specific program not learning very much. Your best bet is to buy a book that is targeted to the program you are using, otherwise you'll find yourself wasting a lot of time and finding out that more than half the things in the book don't apply to your particular software."
1,Lousy deal,I think this was the worst deal I have ever gotten! I have since seen several mirrors with same and greater magnification at my local stores for half the price.Very disappointed.
4,Good buy,"I take vit E reg., as part of my ""stay healthy"" plan & it was a good buy, and would recommend to anyone .(Id also advise anyone taking Vit E to take selenium 200mcg, but that's my opinion)"
3,Quite a good piece of work in this theme,The design and layout of the book is good and easy to read but the major problem is lack of pictures through the entire documents.
4,An unusual structure,This book was quite different in it's structure. The narrative skips from voice to voice with the real protaganist being German society as it goes through a remarkable series of changes. The book provokes much thought and reflection on Germany's unique and sometimes horrific role in the 20th century. A very honest and intelligent book. I would have given it 5 stars except for some chapters where references to some of the german literature and poetry escaped me. This book was an artistically brave effort that works 95% of the time. I had never read Grass before but will check out some of his earlier work after reading this.
4,A fine literature review,"This book illustrates the ""microeconomic theory"" behind the functioning of banking institutions. It is in the format of an academic literature review on this subject. The level is for upper undergrads or grad students. Ideal for use with a ""topics in advanced microeconomics"" Or ""asymmetric information"" course. Yet as concise as it might be, the book lacks motivation to the reader. The results can be better put into context."
1,Disposable plastic junk,"The spring action for the hammer is created by bending plastic. After only a few uses, it will stretch out and no longer function. Absolute garbage."
2,Best suited for pre teens,"This is the first of a trilogy, and although the title may intrigue adults, the language, storyline and characters are best suited for much younger readers. There are no real challenges for the hero, Jarl, who just seems to be incredibly lucky in that every situation resolves itself with very little trouble. The tone is light enough for pre teens to enjoy, and the presence of the dragons as major characters will keep them entertained through the following two books. Adults will find it a rather simple and boring story."
4,Get a square bit,"If you're planning to use a lot of these with a power drill, don't use the enclosed phillips bit. It works, but it does not give enough grip on the screw, and the screw easily cams out. I went through a whole box of 8x2.5"" before figuring out the solution. I'd say that maybe one in four would go all the way in without slipping. All others would require multiple attempts, and some would get damaged to the point of being unusable. It's extremely annoying and time consuming.Things got much better with a third-party square #2 bit. Almost no slippage even at high rpm's and greatly improved productivity.The screws seem to work well as advertised, they go in smoothly without bending or breaking, wood splitting is minimal."
1,It does not work. John,Two buttons on the bottom right corner of the monitor do not work and the screen does not stay on. I would like to return the monitor and get a same model if available replacement. John
2,"Great Monitor, Poor Customer Service and Product Support","I purchased this monitor for our business. It is the fourth of these monitors that we purchased. The monitor is great. This last monitor, however, had a problem. The screen was titled due to a manufacturing defect. Well, I called View Sonic to see what they could do about it. They told me that they would replace it with a new monitor. Great, I thought!!! Well, that was almost two months ago and I am still waiting. Every time I follow up, the customer service personnel tell me that the replacement will be processed that day or the next day. Then I invariably get a call back saying that they have no stock of that item and I will have to wait! How is it that the company that manufactures an item can't get any stock of the item for two months?"
2,Amazon did the right thing,I purchased this monitor and was not happy with it. It came from CompUSA and I had no luck getting through to them on the phone to arrange a return. I contacted Amazon's customer service and they refunded my money almost instantly saying I was eligible for their satisfaction guarantee. Kudos to Amazon for great customer service.
4,Great deal for the money,"An excellent monitor at an great price. Display is beautiful; had no problems adjusting Windows XP/SP2 to the correct resolution. It would be nice if the cables were a bit longer. The speakers are so/so, but that wasn't important to me."
5,Very Funny,Fun and easy read book. Characters are well described and not to complex to follow. Very funny and entertaining. Parts will make you laugh outloud.
4,"great product, but look out for the dent","it is very good product. Works very well. I did have a problem with the packaging. I received it with dents on it, so I have to exchange them. So look out for these when you receive the product."
5,Can't Get Any Better !!!!,"Fast shipment..Easy to assemble..(took about 15 minutes). I'm a big guy and I'm very comfortable sitting in it. This is a VERY sturdy and nice looking chair. Couldn""t be more pleased. It's the best chair value offered at Amazon, especially for the price. Highly recommended!!!!"
3,monkit,Easy access for food manipulation and a nice finish but has a significant warping problem with higher oven temperatures.
1,Warped straight from the box!,"Today, I received this product, and today I am packaging it back up for return. It is pretty, but it was warped when I took it out of the box, BEFORE I heated it at all. By the way, I remove sticky glue with a stainless steel cleaner, which usually works quite easily."
1,Not What I Expected,"This cookie sheet arrived scratched and bent, and it did not happen during shipping. I could have exchanged it, but the sheet felt light and flimsy, not sturdy, like I expected it to. There are NO specs on the label -- how could I know this was the same product that is advertised here?? I sent it back."
3,norpro stainless steel cookie sheet,"I like that they are stainless steel but, one came a little bent and they were expensive for cookie sheets."
2,Time to put the smack down,I didn't get the box set. I only got Doggystyle volume 1.I was also disappointed by this movie. It switches too often from hard core porn to some rapper (not snoop) smoking and rapping. Nothing kills the mood or erection quicker than a guy with a gold grill popping up on the screen.
1,Sad,"I was so disappointed by what I heard in this version. Patti LuPone's voice is of no comparison to Madonna's. Madonna makes it sad, passionate, and beautiful. LuPone's voice is simply obnoxious and annoying. Someone needs to teach her how to sing. All I can say is, what a waste of beautiful music."
3,Original cast of Evita,I was very disappointed when I get the CD and realized it was only the first act! I immediately contacted the sender and he very quickly returned the money to me. I will try to order again for the FULL cast recording.
2,Disappointed in sound quality,This seems like a very old recording and the sound quality was way below my expectations. I would not suggest buying this if you are looking for a wonderful recording of this fabulous (my favorite of all times) play.
2,This is a great CD except for Patti LuPone,"So far, this is my favorite version of Evita, but I cannot stand Patti LuPone's voice and since she unfortunately sings most of the songs on this album I have to give it a two star rating. I think that all the other cast members sing brilliantly. I also think that Many Patinki's voice is too wishy washy to portray Che. He would be a great character on a Disney cartoon though."
1,"The worst rendition of ""Evita"" I have ever heard in my life!","Patti LuPone has absolutely ZERO singing ability. She screams and shouts her way through the musical. Mandy Patinkin is a really good singer but he is way too weak to portray Che-his voice lacks the wit and sarcasm found in Antonio Bandera's rendition. I love ""Evita"" but this cast is horrible. I don't understand how anyone could enjoy it. Just listen to the samples and you'll understand."
1,Listening to this recording hurts my ears!,"I absolutely cannot stand the screaming of Patti LuPone. She is the worst singer I have ever heard. All the other singers are very bad too. Evita is a great musical but this is a disgusting, disgraceful, and absolutely dispicable recording."
2,UGH,"Though I LOVE Evita,I am really NOT fond of this version. The movie version was my first exposure to it, and though I have never been a Madonna fan, and think her voice is FAR from theater quality, I find Patti's voice extremely annoying, with the music chaotic and equally annoying. Even Che isn't that great. I think the movie version is far 'richer' and more pleasant on the ears. But that is just my opinion."
1,where's the 2nd CD?,"got the CD and there was only 1 of the 2 and it was the 2nd one so the famous""Don't Cry for Me Argentina"" wasn't even on it.My son was soooooo disappointed and was going to see the musical. With shipping and handling and knowing the CD was used we paidaround $8.00 for this product."
5,Once of my all-time favorite CDs!,I had the CD but lost it. Was so excited it for download here. Great collection of songs & artists.
2,Focus on commercial tools,"I bought this book based upon the experience I had with other Hacking Exposed books... but this one has disappointed meThe examples are based on commercial tools only - while I'm certain that there are many open source tools available also.The book contains more than 100 pages of forms and explanations of the legal process, which is nice, but not what I would have expected from a Hacking Exposed book"
3,A great way to conclude a groundbreaking and legendary series.,"Mobile Suit Gundam The Movie: Char's Counterattack is a great way to end a series that created the genre that taken like wildfire. This film's also finally puts to an end the battle between the side colonies and the Zeon Army. Finally, a feud that has been around since the beginning of the series: Amuro Ray and Char Anzable's final conflict."
2,Doesn't measure up,"I have been a fan of They Might Be Giants for as long as I can remember. I have always loved their ""educational"" songs as much as the purely entertaining ones. I thought it was a great idea for TMBG to move into music geared more toward kids, and loved their prior release, ""No!""However, I don't think that this CD measures up to what TMBG has done in the past. Part of the problem with the CD is that it is music from the DVD, and some of the songs on the DVD are very visual (e.g., ""Letter Shapes""). There are a few songs that are enjoyable just on the CD (my favorites are ""Alphabet of Nations"" and ""Z Y X""), but if you want to really enjoy this release, forgo the CD and just buy the DVD.Also, just so that I wouldn't be posting only my adult comments on this product, I showed the DVD to my two nephews (ages 1 and 4), and they got bored after about the third song and asked to watch The Wiggles instead."
4,Gave us all the training we needed,My daughter had to go on total bed rest when she was 6 months pregnant. She was unable to go to birthing classes so I purchased this video. Although it looks like it was filmed in the 1960's or 1970's it taught us everything we needed to know. I was her coach when she gave birth and the information the tape gave us made the birth so much easier.
3,Much older than I thought.,This video looks like it was shot around the time my mother was pregnant with me. OK well maybe not that old but you get my point. Being that I couldn't fit an actual class into our schedule I would say this is better than nothing. It covers most of what we need to know but I really wish they would make a new one!
3,Informative but outdated,The information provided was somewhat helpful but the video is so outdated. It's at least 20 years old. It lacks the latest technology and information. It's not worth the price considering how old the video is.
2,Wish I would have had the choice to attend classes,"As a Mom to Be that works full time, I didn't have the time to attend a Childbirth Class, but now wish I would have. I purchased this video and was disappointed by the lack of information for today. I watched the video with a friend that was also pregnant and was taking classes, she shared with me all the updated information that she learned. Unfortunately the concept of ""Lamaze"" is outdated and I needed to learn more about what to expect from my hospital delivery today. I wish I would have learned more on the actual delivery. The computer graphics were cool but the outdated material didnt prepare me like I wanted to be prepared."
5,Having Your Baby!,"My niece is having a baby and my sister, her mother, has passed away. My niece is low income and could not afford lamaze classes and this was a great way for her and I to practice lamaze at home. It also helped for her to continue to watch the DVD over and over for her own reassurance and practice, when I was not available. The baby is due this week, but I can say that for the last four days the video has incredibly helped my niece to labor at home and not make false runs to the hospital. I wish I had this video when I had my children!"
2,Not as useful as expected,"If you are like me, who read books and magazines to get prepared during pregnancy, you may find this video not that useful. The only thing new is the breathing techniques, but many people say that when it gets to real labor, no breathing technique helps."
1,Bad. Bad. Bad.,This video is so old and outdated. And the woman in it is nasty. Don't buy this. You do not want to see this before you have your baby. I wish I had gotten a book to read instead.
3,hard to watch,"I didn't have patience for this dvd. If you have more patience than me, than I'm sure it would be very beneficial. I didn't finish watching it and still had a great labor & delivery."
4,Required reading for consultants,Flawless is a great guide to navigating through the most difficult challenges that a consultant faces. Block provides practical approaches as well as simple guidelines to improve and enhance any consultant's toolbox.
3,You Get Out What You Put In,This is the essence of this book.Full of practical and common sense ideas for consulting professionals. Can't say that it will teach you how to be flawless in your consulting services but it will give you some pretty solid ideas.
2,Yawn. This cd is overrated by Amazon listeners.,"I bought this cd because of the very clever seattle grunge rock single and the rave reviews of Amazon listeners. In this instance, reliance on Amazon reviewers was a big mistake. Country and folk music composers have always been better at lyrics than music, and this cd is no exception. You may initially like many of the songs, but they quickly become an eviscerated, boring mush of all of the signature elements of country, folk and rock music. There's an acoustic guitar and a harmonica in most songs to make you think folk, there's the monotonous base rhythms to make you think country, and there's electric guitar to make you think rock. Easy listening from the get-go, and once you know the lyrics, it becomes predictable easy-listening that'll put you to sleep."
5,good magazine,i loved b. .... ..... ..... .... ... .... .... .... .... .... .... ... ... ... ..... .... .
2,InStyle has changed for the worst,"I'm a guy, and I used to find InStyle a fairly interesting magazine about the Hollywood lifestyle.I recently bought a subscription with a gift card and found that InStyle has simply become a shopping catalog,with pages and pages of pictures of women's clothing and makeup.I'm letting the subscription lapse.Goodbye InStyle!"
5,Fun & inspiring,A good magazine for fashion suggestions for all ages plus some great ideas for do-it-yourself cosmetic & fashion creations. I look forward to each issue.
1,35 days and still I have not received any!,More than a month and I'm still waiting to receive it!How can I rate this magazin since I have not seen it!
1,not receiving subscription,I don't know if this is a sham - but I purchased a 1-year subscription for InStyle via Amazon for $5 on 9/27/09. I still have not received one issue yet. I now I have to waste my time to find out what's going on. POOR SUBSCRIBER SERVICE.
3,instyle,I would be able to review this better if I actually receive the magazine! Haven't seen it yet???!!!
1,A rehash of the forgettable,"If you're looking for Louis playing the trumpet, don't buy this album. One saccharine vocal after the next. A rehash of the forgettable. I regret having spent my money on this recording. It will accompany me to the used CD store for a trade-in."
5,The cornerstone to any bluegrass music collection,"Bill Monroe is truely the father of bluegrass music. Thiscollection spans his entire career, from his earliest recordings withhis brother Charlie, through his final session in 1994. Throughout his career, Monroe has produced some of the greatest legends in all of bluegrass. Del McCoury,Peter Rowan, Jimmy Martin, Flatt and Scruggs, Don Reno, Kenny Baker, Richard Greene, Vassar Clements and countless others made their debuts on Monroe records. All these artists appear on multiple tracks throughout the anthology. This anthology is a necessary addittion for any lover of American Music."
4,No hill too high,"I would have to say that I can not tell you about the performance of this bike on mountain trails. I love to ride this bike and all my riding his been done on pavement, and occasional dirt paths.It does the job making street riding easier and safer since I found it necessary to vary my speeds according to traffic....and the grip shift of 21-speeds does what I need it to do.I can't say how difficult it is to assemble. I decided to let a professional put it together. But the delivery was darn fast! I don't know if living in Southern California helped that.....The negative side about the bike is that I find the tires to not necessarily be all-terrain. On some dirt paths I found I have to watch my speed otherwise my tires will skid uncontrollably, especially too much for an amateur rider like me."
5,very useful,"A great book to understand the theory and the application of statistics. The examples used in each chapter are very useful in understanding the concept.I suggest this book to every researcher and instructer to keep it on their desks. ""This"" is the reference."
4,An amazing first person account of history's cruelty,"This story of ""Night Never Ending"", is in itself incredible reading, but the fact that it was written almost 20 years ago during the height of the cold war is sensational. More current offerings of literature on this subject hauntingly confirm the detail of horrors described by Eugenjusz Komoroski, the sole survivor of the Koselsk prison camp and Katyn mass murder. Please read ""The Murderers of Katyn"" after you read ""Night Never Ending"" you will be amazed at the accuracy of his description of events during 1940."
5,Just in time for rainy season,"The size of bicycle tire I normally use is relatively rare. These are great, they help channel the water away, and I've lasted nearly an entire year on the rear wheel (I commute daily, 6 miles (~10 km) one way, which adds up the wear and tear.Long lasting, good in all weather."
1,Where's the Feeling,"After reading some of the reviews I expected a very inspiring story, but the author shows no depth of emotion. The writing is flat. The author's story has its moments, but just when she gets you involved she drops that story line and moves on to another. It makes her come across as shallow. For example she has a chapter on the effect that Princess Diana's death had on herself. A disappointing effort."
2,"SHORT, INTENSE TALE","This slender book provides intense reading; it is almost a play for just two characters, as a tough boy discovers his aging grandfather. Angry and rebellious that his parents have temporarily abandoned him with an unknown old man in a decrepit house out in the boonies, the boy tries to run away. But he gradually finds himself drawn to stay--not because of the crusty oldtimer, but to help care for a sick crane. The only tenderness the old man exhibits is for wildlife, which provides a tentative bond. The kid, who is rarely addressed by his name, is not a sympathetic protagonist (boastful, selfish, arrogant), but he finally grows out of himself enough to feel compassion for another species. In so doing, he becomes more human and accepting of his suddenly-acquired grandfather."
4,The House Of Wings,"The House Of Wings is heart touching for grandsons and grandfathers. The book is called The House Of Wings by Betsy Byars. I enjoyed this book because how the grandfather is so determind to get Sammy back so they can talk. But Sammy is calling his grandfather a dirty liar, because his father and mother went to Detrout without him. The beginning is confusing because it's a flashback,but then it's back to the present time. Sammy needs to learn to trust, love, and enjoy his grandfather. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes stories of how two different family members get along together as one."
5,One of my favorite albums,"First off. This isn't one of their children's records and I'm pretty sure the band has unfortunately disowned it.That being said it's a phenomenal record. I always listen to it when I need to be cheered up. It's got all of the insightfulness of a Ben Folds record and the music is about as original as it gets. There are certainly some silly songs and those are the ones that jump out at first (Bender to Ender, Buddhist, etc) but tracks like My Key, Ain't No Crime, Shoulda Come Over, and The Way That It Goes really have a deeper layer to them beyond just playing around. Anyone that likes a sense of humor with their downtrodden funk-rock really ought to give this one a listen."
2,Get something else!,"The beaker is cheaply made and broke with a little tap through washing. Amazon will send this to you in a box with no packing, just the raw press! I used a chopstick to stir the coffee and treated this glass with care, but it's too thin and not tempered. Replacement part is expensive in comparison to the original press. Made great coffee, but only lasted a few weeks. Get something else!"
4,It's okay...,"This is my first french press and we have now substantially converted to making coffee via this method. So why four stars? One of the little plexiglass windows broke within about 60 days, so quality of construction is about what you'd expect for this price. That being said, the plastic cover around the primary glass insert is nice insulation for keeping the whole apparatus cool to the touch."
2,Not worth the money,"As a cautious first time mommy, i purchased this product for my 2 yr old based on other reviews. The problem with this product is that the potty topper sheets only have 2 small adhesive strips to hold them onto the toilet seat. With a 2 yr old who has a hard time sitting still and being positioned on an adult toilet, the potty topper shifted on the seat which made it useless. My child ended up sitting on the toilet b/c the topper didn't stay put. I tried multiple times all with the same result. I have now purchased a toilet seat reducer aka folding toilet seat to use in public places. It folds up nicely & stores in a ziploc in my diaper bag. Best of all, it doesn't move or shift when being used. I clean it with antibacterial wipes & can use it over & over unlike the potty toppers. I won't purchase these again as they were a waste of money."
1,fall off the toilet,these suck they don't stay on the toilet. Don't buy them! I got them for the price but just wasted my money
4,Heather's Review,Three Brave Women is a real powerful and exciting book to read. This book was about maybe your fear of something like snakes could mean that your mom and grandma could have that same fear. It also talks about how to some people have a fear of something like snakes or spiders is scary but to other people that is just wierd how they could be scary. It talks about when you face your fear then you should show it off. when you have a litlle fear of snakes or spiders then someone who makes fun of you could actually have a fear of something big like cats.
4,"Great kite, takes a bit to learn",Like this kite a lot but it does take a bit to learn how to fly it. It definitely a bit tricky and goes a bit nuts sometimes. Very fun kite though and very durable. Would purchase from here again.
5,"""Written from the heart of God....""","Everyone seems to know how to tell us the best way to handle troubles these days. Charles Stanley knows how to tell us the Scriptural way, and truly writes from the heart of God.Frankly, this book is only matched by the Joseph story in learning how God wants us to handle adversity. ""With Joseph in the University of Adversity"" is one of the best on this.Both this, and the Joseph book speak to us from the heart, and not from the lofty heights of pedantic scholarship. Dr. Stanley is loved by nearly everyone. His unique in insight into surviving adversity will only add to his followers!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
5,When Love Finds You by Vince Gill,My husband and I bought this CD because it had a song on it that we had been trying to find for months. Amazon.com was the only one that had it. If you want music that goes straight to your soul buy this CD.
2,Not that exciting,"I know a bunch of VG fans will be all over me for this, but the cd just doesn't take off. I never heard of the dude until recently when I saw him on t.v. and he was smoking--great voice, great guitarist, band that worked like a locomotive. This is too restrained, too pretty. Yea, you'll say, ""What century is this? You didn't know VG?"" Nope, but I do know what I heard on t.v. live was really great, and this cd sure ain't."
5,A poignant story reminiscent of Velveteen Rabbit,"Kate DiCamillo's The Miraculous Journey Of Edward Tulane tells of a china rabbit named Edward who is owned by a girl who loves him. Then one day he lost, and begins a series of adventures which takes him from loving arms to the depths of the ocean and around the country. A poignant story reminiscent of Velveteen Rabbit - but with far more detail - will immerse advanced elementary to middle school readers in an exploration of love and longevity."
5,Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane,"From Kids' Corner, [...]:Adam says: This is really one of the best books I've ever read. It's a great adventure and a great story with great characters that show how different people can be. Edward Tulane is a selfish and conceited toy rabbit, who thinks he's better than everyone, until the day he is lost from the little girl who has loved and spoiled him. Edward travels across the country to new owners, some good, like the poor boy who used the rabbit as a puppet to make money. Some owners were not so good, like the old mean woman who used Edward as a scarecrow. Along the way Edward learns a lot, and I did too. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants an adventure.This and other great books are reviewed on my web site, [...]Kim Childress, Book Editor, Girls' Life Magazine"
4,Rabbit rocks,"Excellent book. I could not put the book down, wondering what will happen to Edward next. I can relate to the little girl Abilene, because I have a stuffed bunny myself."
5,The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane,"This book is truly the best book I have ever read!! My 6yr old son and I read it over Christmas break from school. We read 2 to 3 chapters a night before bed. It was very hard to put it down. This book would make a wonderful animated movie! I loaned it to a friend from work, an older man and an avid reader. He called his daughter and told her she had to read it to his grand daughter. I will probably read it again!! Highly recommended!!!"
5,Miraculous journeys are worth it in the end,"This is a children's story with a good deal to say to everyone of any age. Like life, the adventure can keep going downhill until the only thing worse is to die (or almost die). If one accepts the lessons of the journey and improves thereby, the end of the journey is transcendent. This particular story really brings that out."
2,a big no no,dont read this to any kid with a hearth i was sad and mean who would put mean thing this book .we have to read it to 1 to 4 grade kid it would be raded pg 13
3,Maybe not for kids? A bit depressing...,"The story was beautifully written but chapter by chapter I became more and more depressed. Actually, I wanted to put it down and just not read it after a while, but I continued. After such a dreadfully painfull and heart-breaking story I would have liked more than one page for a happy ending. Would I recommend it? With some hesitation... Would I read it again? No..."
5,"Easy Read. Both sons, ages 10 and 13 liked this story.","They felt that it was sweet, sometimes sad but that the bunny learns to love and that after many different experiences and having his life touched by others, he is changed and has a tender heart."
2,Downright Depressing,"My daughter is reading this for her English class in 4th grade. I always read whatever she is reading so we can discuss it at home. This book is just downright depressing. I get that the author is trying to make a point, but geez! This book is depressing from about chapter 4 through 26. Not my cup of tea. Also, I don't think that the kids in my daughter's classroom are fully going to understand this book...even though it is a gifted class the message will be missed on 9 year olds!"
3,so close,"I wanted so much to love this story as much as DiCamillo's other books. It just didn't come through. Kids age 5 and 9 liked it, me not so much. Pictures are really beautiful."
5,"Too, too good","A wonderful, simple, lovely story. A warning, though: don't read this in public. I'm sure I perplexed a few of my fellow bus-riders as I cried over the end of the book..."
4,Children's fiction at its best ... just not sure what age group,"This is a really sweet story ... but never ever saccharine. Its sweet simplicity hides a story of great love and great sadness. Both the desperate situations that he finds himself in and the flawed lives of the people who own him, lead ""Edward"" to find room in his heart for love.It is more than bittersweet at times as Edward learns to open his heart. (Note : I didn't cry ... I just had something in my eye)Not sure what age group I would read it to or suggest it to ... there are confronting topics within."
5,I love this book!,I recommend this book to everyone. It is a great story for a read aloud or for a child to read for themselves. She is a great author!
5,It gave us chills!!!!!,"I selected Edward Tulane as a teacher read aloud for my third grade class. At first, the plot seemed a bit involved and disjointed for younger children. How could so many things happen to a defenseless china rabbit? It seemed that we would never get to the ""good part"". The kids did not react much as I read, which is highly unusual. After reading a few chapters, however, the kids began to beg for me to read another when our time ended each day. While the subject matter can be a bit brutal at times, we stopped to discuss any misunderstood themes, and, soon, the kids hung on every word! The initial plot twist of Edward becoming separated from his owner made us wonder if he would ever return to her again. Kate DiCamillo amazingly twists the plot in the last few pages of the book. Prepare to have cold chills and goosebumps! My class and I certainly did!"
5,wonderful book to read together with your child.,"This book was wonderful, tragic, sweet, and funny. My daughter and I read it together and loved every minute of it. The writing is fabulous and the illustrations are just so sweet. My daughter and I bawled at the completion of the book. It will be a book/memory we will always cherish."
2,The miraculous journey of edward tulane,"This book is funny and sad. My favorite character is Edward Tulane , because he is cute. I like the girl that named Edward, Jangles. by Michael"
3,A stuffed rabbit has feelings?,"I never had an imaginary friend and my stuffed animals really never emoted so I read this book saying to myself, 'really?'"
2,"Teeny, tiny amount","I haven't actually tasted the product yet, but you should be aware that it comes in a teeny, tiny package equaling about one tablespoon. I'll admit I should have looked at the amount closer before I ordered! But now YOU know."
2,"Little F3, lotta F4",In search of a new camera and considering the F3? There are better resources than this if the F3 is what you have in mind. The book breaks down to about 1/3 to 2/3 on F3 F4 content. Nice section on AF lenses.
3,"Interesting, But very Expensive, Much less on Ebay!","Manual arrived after three weeks! Not in bad shape. If you want a manual, check out the prices on Ebay, they're 1/2 of what I paid for this manual on Amazon."
5,Probably the best book I have ever read,"After reading this book I stopped drinking and smoking on the drop of a dime. Within several weeks I was a vegetarian. I have read ""Conversations with God"" that I loved, I read the ""Celestine Prophecy"" - so I have read several books in that genre. But I have never come across a book that packs this much of a spiritual punch. Did reading this book change my life? YES! People say that about books, but it is something else when it happens to you. This book has influenced my life more than any other book has. I can only say that the quality of your life will be improved after reading this book, it should be read again and again."
1,I threw the book in the trash,"I read half of the book and was so disappointed I threw it in the trash. I think the ""agreements"" are basic, no nonsense ideas on how to live a better life. You don't need this book to teach you these things. As a Christian, it went against my beliefs of what ""truth"" is. Lots of new-age (book calls it Toltec Wisdom) mumble jumble. I read a passage to one of my Christian friends and he couldn't believe the garbage I was reading. Instead, pick up Rick Warren's ""Purpose Driven Life"" or Joel Osteen's ""Your Best Life Now"" - 2 books I highly recommend if you want ""Personal Freedom""."
2,This book WILL NOT change your life.,"I will never get over remarks of how a book will change your life. Granted, this book made some valid points and surely these agreements can be useful tools towards leading a better life, but I cannot believe the end-all claims this author makes. Like on Page 95, that by following the Four Agreements, ""you will have a beautiful life."" Those of us forced to live in reality know that there is no such simple solution anywhere! It's an OK book, but you'd be better off just borrowing it from the library."
2,"Great theme, poor writing",The Four Agreements makes a lot of sense if you can wade through the bad prose and extra chatter. I couldn't finish the book because of these annoying factors.
5,Eye Opener,"Im now reading this for a THIRD time. What started out as a book report for a college class, is turning into a fascination! It truly has opened a part of my mind that would have been closed forever.MUST READ!!! Easy reading, no $1000 words and I felt the authors' knowledge and caring while I was reading."
4,Emotionally Resourceful,"I had this book recommended to me by a good friend. I have now ordered it for my sister and my mother. When reading, keep the concept in mind the message that it's trying to portray, less the religion aspect. It is very helpful in giving you a 'reality check'. Thank you Mr. Ruiz~"
5,AS GOOD AS ADVERTISED,"I just love how this book can be applied to everyone. It really doesn't matter what type of person you are or where you're from...you will be able to understand the message presented; moreover, you will be much happier when you adopt the four universal, obvious (yet more difficult to apply in real life when you ask yourself at the end of the day if you have applied the four principles throughout the day) principles.Definitely a five star book."
3,Premise does not quite match the language,"The premise of the book is delightful. The language tends toward the negative, the what is wrong, more than it focuses on the positive energy to bring about the desired shift. There is much value in the concepts and if you are guided to the message, you will hear it in the way that works best for you."
4,Good Read,"It's the kind of thing you already know, and it's written in very simple language. It's also a very quick read, I'd recommend it. I want my daughter to read it."
5,Behavior Changing Guide,"This book gently reminds the reader that the domestication of childhood, if not challenged, can perpetuate a dream world of crisis and confusion throughout adulthood.Since insight never cured anyone, Miguel provides a pathway, agreements, to change the error thinking of the past.A delightful journey down the road of healthy living for anyone willing to give a radically alternative view a chance. A terrific gift for fellow travelers on the journey of life."
4,Could have been a pamphlet,"The Four Agreements presented in this book are fantastic. They are simple, easy to put into practice, and they make a difference. It's too bad that the rest of the book is filled with New Age spiritual mumbo jumbo and meaningless platitudes. (I don't take it personally, though . . .) This ""filler"" material made it hard for me to trudge through the book."
4,"This is a good, helpful book","If you are going to live in a box of life, his box is MUCh better than what most people live. I would have given it 5 stars but he doesn't show you how to live outside the box. He does help you to live in a much better box and that is a vast improvement and perhaps is the first step to completely living outside the box."
1,Very disappointed,Unfortunately the book I ordered never arrived (The Four Agreements...). They tell me it was lost in the mail. I canceled my order and expect to see a refund for the book and postage soon.R. Kropp
5,Top Notch,"A good book to read if you enjoy learning about yourself, and appreciate tangible steps to take on the path."
5,The Four Agreements: a rating,"I would recommend this book to anyone with an open mind and half a brain .. and I think it should be ""required"" reading for anyone seeking ""answers"".The ""Fifth Agreement"" is a perfect follow-up .. and I think anyone who does read ""The Four Agreements"" will immediately seek out the ""Fifth"" .. both books reveal basic ""truths"" that should be shared with the world"
2,Too metaphorical and not practical enough,"I liked the idea behind this book, but I prefer ""self help"" books that have concrete advice, not talk of floating between clouds, getting rid of black smoke, etc."
4,didactic support,This book is truly helping me to understand which reactions my own behaviour will provoke and to prepare my reactions to unexpected behaviours.
2,"""Wisdom""","Although the actual 4 agreements make perfect sense, the author presents it in a ridiculous way. It's an easy read, if you can ignore the arrogant voice of the author, and the poor use of the English language. He'll make a valid point in his book, and spend the next 3 paragraphs swerving into some area that had no relevance whatsoever to what he was trying to prove. At times, it read like a bad high school paper.I was looking for a way to explore personal freedom. This was nothing more than what is discussed on any Oprah Winfrey Show. Yes, the 4 agreements were good, but was it worth the time to sift through the garbage to get it? I didn't think so."
1,Assigned Reading,"I hate this book. It's sounds like something someone came up with while they were on drugs. I literally fantasized about burning it when my class was done but the bookstores around here usually run out of them in the course of the semester so I can probably make a buck off it to go towards buying a more useful book. I really don't see why it's part of the ethics course, it barely makes any sense. I mean it tries but the visuals it gives me are frankly disturbing. I suppose a more spiritual person than I would get something out of it."
1,Miguel Ruiz is a sociopath,"This book is a poorly written, self aggrandizing impiety.There's a reason why cultures die. Because they no longer serve the current belief system of the advancing culture. However, since this whole ""ancient belief system"" was enshrouded in mystery, one can't question if Miguel's ridiculous tautology is fiction or fact. Which I'd imagine that he understood (that's why it's a secret) and is crucial to his marketing campaign--granting exemption to personal accountability and empathy.Usually when cultures live in secret it's because their beliefs are too abhorrent (think KKK) for the current societal values. We've been advanced for a while now, I'm guessing that the one thing that the ancient human sacrificing aztecs and our current society have in common is that we are all allergic to sociopaths.The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom, A Toltec Wisdom Book"
5,A Must For Every Spiritual Person,My Hopi Elder in the Medicine Circle I have attended recommended this book 6 years ago and I have bought numerous copies to give out to friends. A very practical spirituality and approach to life's issues!
3,"Sweet, small, simple, and yet very very BIG. . .","A great little book to keep by your bed and read before you go to sleep. Simple slow, adapted Toltec wisdom, but basically a new spin on a timeless lesson on the simplicity of ethics and life."
1,Not worth the time,"I made every effort to take Ruiz's principles to heart. I challenged my own belief system and try to absorb the true principles that The Four Agreements advocates. What I found was an arrogant author spouting over-dramatized, simplistic principles about nothing at all.My biggest problem with The Four Agreements is that it is written in such a tone as to condemn anyone who doesn't agree. The author takes a stance that if you do not agree with his philosophy then you are simple, nave or beaten into domestication like an animal by your parents. Read the title and the four agreements themselves and be on your way. You'll be much better off."
5,The words of this book remind me how to live a full and loving life.,"Every time I purchase this book, I end up giving it away and buying it again. Depending on when I read it, I get something different out of it; the words of this book are timeless and very meaningful."
2,Don't waste your time.,"Not only don't waste your time, but don't waste your money. Anything that you need to know about the four agreements can be read on the inside flap of the front cover. That about covers it and the rest of the book just embellishes in a mundane, repetitive and simplistic manner, the same theme.Go to the bookstore, read the cover and move on. The rest is not worth the effort. I struggled through half the book and found the reading cumbersome."
5,A Work of Art,"The Four Agreements is truly a living document. This book speaks to me each time I open it, in ways always relevant to what is going on in my life. An amazing work of art.Another excellent Toltec book is ""The Power of Belief"" by Ray Dodd. This is the best ""how to"" description of the Mastery of Awareness, and the Mastery of Transformation that I have ever come across. I highly recommend it be read in conjunction with The Four Agreements."
5,The Four Agreements,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. It changed my life totally, in the best way. I bought each of my children a copy and talk to all of my clients about it.I wish the whole world would read it."
3,An introspective read,I enjoyed this book. It had a lot of positive concepts that can really improve my life. Worth the read!
4,How do we know this is Toltec wisdom?,"As much as I enjoyed the book and took away principles I will definitely cogitate and act on, I have to skeptically ask how can we actually know this is ""Toltec wisdom"" since it has been ""hidden for ages"" and only now coming out? (And I haven't even read The Fifth Agreement yet encouraging skepticism of any belief.) Someone help me out here."
4,Four Agreements Book,"This is a great little book, packed with a lifetime of challenge! Book was in good shape at a very good price. I bought it for my 14 year old son to read. Its never too soon to start living by the four agreements!Dan"
5,Loved every word,"This book is an inspirational guide to life much like Dreams gateway to the self. Belcher (the author) shows readers how to function in everyday life at maximum capacity by inward reflection of inner ambitions, be the whole of the half that walks about, and become the person they always wanted to be. Also recommend the Little Guide to Happiness."
3,Crazy,Crazy making stuff! This book put me in a grumpy and frustrated mood. The contradictions and suggestions were overwhelming. My daughter loved this book. Me? Not so much. I'm still not sure about finishing it.
4,SMALL BOOK - POWERFUL TRUTHS,"The only downside of the book is that it ended all too soon. However, there are some powerful words written throughout the pages of this book. Perhaps the Four Agreements could also be be called the four simple truths of personal freedom. Be impeccable with your word, always do your best, do not take things personally and do not make assumptions. The Toltec way is not a new philospohy for much of the content of this book is based on Eastern philosophies and many religions. What you will find here are basically the ""golden rules"" for success in your life in a concise and simple format.If you wish to expand on these philosophies and seek inner-strength, peace and contentment, I would also recommend, ""Healing Society"" by Dr. Seung-Huen Lee, and ""World of Tibetan Buddhism,"" Gyatso Tenzin, et al, both are excellent books."
3,A great way to live your life.,"This book is GREAT at teaching people a good way to approach life, by living by the four agreements as specified in this book, and in my opinion; this book or something similar philosophy should be read by every troubled young person.I have a HUGE nitpick against this book.This book is being sold as a book to assist people in practising Shamanism, and in my opinion; ""toward that effort; this book falls amazingly flat.""If you want a great way to approach physical life; this philosophy id good. If you want to explore Shamanism; please go to my ""about me"" area, and see my assorted listmania lists such as ""Shamanism, Indian, or Wicca"" lists; Two_Bears.Wah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)."
4,Great book!,"I had to read this book for a class I was taking. While the book is written with ideas that differ from the norm, the main ideas are phenomenal! I looked past the parts I didn't agree with because the overall meaning is so great -I have recommended it to many people and use those main ideas most every day - I wish I had read this book sooner in my life."
5,personal freedom,"This book is easy to read and takes a few hours. The wisdom is something we probably all know inside ourselves. I was saying ""yes, I know that"" all the way through. It is not simple to put into practice since I have some bad habits but it calls attention to the places where I am out of alignment with myself and others and for that I read the book over and over to keep reminding me of it's truth."
3,Nice quick read,"Practiccal, down to earth, applicable, efficient and philosophical advices on habits to follow to live a life with less worries. Recommended."
1,"I was ""dreaming"" when I bought this...","I found this book a complete waste of time. Luckily it was not very long. Anyone with a shred of common sense already knows and understands the 4 ""agreements"" without this book! What about courtesy for others, right vs. wrong, etc? Based on the ""wisdom"" of this book I could decide to be a murderer and feel justified."
3,"Good ideas, but overly-spiritual for me at times","This book is a very fast read. It is written well, in simple language with examples that the reader can relate to and grasp the main ideas with. Overall, I liked the 4 agreements the author puts forth and I liked the examples, stories and support provided for these 4 agreements. What I didn't like was the overly-spiritual overtone of the book, the prayer at the end, and the idea in certain parts of the book that this tip will ""transform your life."" (I'm generally doubtful that a book, a paragraph or a sentence will transform my life.) Despite these drawbacks that didn't work for me personally, the book's main points, arguments and conclusions are commonsense and definitely worth consideration, and hopefully, incorporation into one's thinking and approach to life."
3,"Funny, but somewhat predictable","The sense of humor the author has it somewhat predictable once you get accustomed to it, so there are fewer sur[rised as you go along (especially since on several occasions he refers to people pretending to be end-tables). If I had only paid the sticker price it might have been one thing but sellers on AMAzon charge an arm & a leg for this book. I'll sell you my copy for a lot less if you want it!"
3,Organic -- and contains nylon?,"What is the point of using organic cotton, if you then mix it with nylon? One of the modern world's absurdities. For those who want 100% cotton, this isn't it. For those who want organic, this isn't it.Comments to the above have convinced me to raise my rating of this product from 1 star to 3. The comments basically say that even if it's not really all organic, because of the nylon, at least what cotton there is in the product is organic and non- geneticlly modified. Good point, but I still say that for those who just read ""organic"" and don't read the fine print, people may be mislead by this product. Especially important for people allergic to synthetic materials."
5,The Drowning Man,"I enjoyed the book very much, but all of the Father John and Vicky Holden series are wonderful reading, The second reading is as good as the first."
1,Keep Shopping,"Yes, it really is broke. I'm looking for something right now and it's not going to be yet another RCS remote. They're great when they work - having said that, this is the 5th unit thats died. However, before giving up, do follow the 'programming procedure' afer changing batteries; that's necessary every time you change batteries (you'll change batteries a couple of times before having to buy another one)."
5,A Stirring Performance,Paul Bisaccia shows his artistry and versatility in this stirring performance of American favorites. He demonstrates that he is equally at home in popular and classical repertoire.
3,"works well, sound a bit too ""crisp"" for me","I primarily bought this product because of the padding on the handle - the old one I had was just rought on the hand after a few songs in a set. Anyway, this works well, but doesn't really have the best sound for me. I was hoping for something more ""earthy"" and not so ""crisp"". But the crispness does mean that it's really good for fast tunes!"
4,Statistical dummies can understand this,"The book is well laid out and the examples well explained without statistical jargons that confuse people. I have forgotten most of the statistics that I learnt in school but I was able to recall and follow through while reading this book. It is easy for even the 'statistical dummies' to understand, in my opinion. I will highly recommend it for graduate students."
2,nice sunglasses... buuut....,"very nice sunglases, i like it, buuut... the ""humvee military"" it is just a name... two days after i received the glases they get broken. they are kind of weak...nice case they have too..."
3,the book is in internet,the book are many free papers on internet.There are very theory technologies but no new contents about DEVS.
4,Worth your time,"My third Ernenwein novel and I was not disappointed. Well developed characters with a storyline that made it hard to put the book down to take a break. The main character, Jim Modeen, was definitely ""his own man"" with an ambition. It was easy for me to understand why this novel received the Western Writers of America's 1956 Spur Award."
5,LUV THIS BOOK!,I absolutely love this book - it is so down to earth and full of great ideas and suggestions. Really ignites the passion to pursue a healthy & 'raw' lifestyle. Can't wait for Alissa's next book!
5,BEST raw & live food book ever!,"alissa has done an amazing job!! i own all the major raw food books available. but Alissa has topped them all! this is not just a recipe book - although the dishes are delicious. but it is truly a guide to how to evolve into a living foods healthy life. too many other authors are fanatical or extremists concerning raw foods. Alissa has a direct, simple, and practical approach that makes it ok to start wherever you are at. and she delivers all the necessary tools and info to do so. the recipes are fantastic! my wife and use Alissa'a recipes on a daily basis to make great and satisfying meals. i wish i could give this MORE than 5 stars! by the way, i also HIGHLY recommend Alissa'a DVD. it has a variety of dishes that she shows you how to prepare. and it is easy to follow. definitely get it with her book and you'll be well on your way!"
1,There are better raw books,"Don't waste your money on Alissa Cohen's products, if you want concise, indepth information on raw food and tasty recipes, Dr. Gabriel Cousens ""Rainbow Green Live Food Cusine"" is far more informative. The recipes from Matthew Kenney and Sarma Melngallis cookbook entitled ""Raw Food Real World"" or Matt Amsden's ""Rawvolution"" are wonderful and a lot more interesting than what you will find in Living on Live Food."
1,Not what I expected.,"With a title like ""Lesson Plans for the Busy Librarian,"" this book seemed like a must have for me, a busy librarian. When I received the item I was very disappointed to find that none of the lessons were that unique or interesting. In addition to being the same old thing, the clip art is subpar, and the organization is very random. Let me just say this, I have owned the book for over a year and am yet to use a single lesson plan from it."
3,"Not great, but...","There is some some solid tracks on this CD, if you replace the Latin House songs with Freestyle, this would been a good CD from the start to finish. Edwin Ramos has a distinct style, sometimes he has long breaks without anything that happens. I would love some edits or changing in the beat, also the percussion sounds sometimes a little ""homemade"". Last song would have been a great song if it would have any drums in it at all.. The vocals are ok/good."
5,World Party Rocks!,"I've had the album and the cassette - both tired and obsolete by now. Getting the CD of Goodbye Jumbo was like welcoming a long lost friend. This must be one of the most underrated recordings in a long time. After all these years it still sounds fresh, crisp, delightful and worthy of goose-pimples. It never really got the recognition it deserved. Excellent!"
4,music playing ear plugs,"It's like ear plugs that play music. The sound quality is very good and the ear buds come with 3 styles of plugs. Triple flange plastic ear plugs. Foam compression in four sizes. Rubber bulb style ear plugs in three sizes. Overall, I would say they're great for air planes and stuff where there is a lot of back ground noise, but if you're in a subway or working out, you're probably better off with some other kind that you could still hear a little through, because they are very effective at blocking background noise."
2,Sound too bright,"OK, first, I do can tell a difference between 192KBps and uncompressed. My primary setup is Musican Fidelity Can + Sennheiser HD600. However, I didn't like Shure at all. Sound is too bright, basically it is like solid state vs. tube sound. Shure sounds way brighter than Sennheiser. Maybe if you are a Grado fan, you'll like them. I actually like sound of cheaper Bose TriPort better (OK, you can flame me now for mentioning Bose and audiophile in the same sentence). I am returning Shure, continue looking."
2,buyer be aware,"Apparently, there are several ""sub-models"" of this model:SE310SE310-KSE310-ASE310-A-KExact specifications are nowhere to be found! And prices differ $150 between these sub-models"
2,Sheer Disappointment - Where's the music?,"I eagerly awaite their arrival, knowing the Shure name and quality from way back to 60's turntable cartridges. What an incredible disappointment! While I must say the clarity is astonishing, it's as though 1/2 the music is missing. The mid range is far and the base non-existent. I don't mean it wasn't boomy or that kind of stuff. It simply isn't here leaving me feeling as though 1/2 the song is missing. The biggest bummer is the redicoulous re-stcking fee I'll have to pay to return them. There is no retailer I could find that carries high end ear buds, let alone is there a way to audition them except to buy and pay if not satisified.I'd stear clear of these if you're any kind of a real audio buff. For the pros? I think not. I'm listening to huge audio files encoded in Windows Media Lossless format. The $50 Skull Candy headphones far surpass the enjoyment of these."
5,On Intelligence,"Very, very interesting! Now you can understand much better how our brain may work and why decisions can be made so quickly!This ideas fit to the independent observations and research you will find in this book: Sources of Power: How People Make Decisions by Gary A. Klein."
4,Sincere shreds,"Hendrix's sloppy surrender to sonic saturation is why this and so many of his live performances work so well despite technical difficulties, both internal and external."
4,Villa Nova junction just kills!,"The reason I bought this cd is mainly because I always loved Jimi's performance of Villa Nova junction with it's beautiful spanish-moorish flurishes.I have heard complaints that the mixing was somehow delibertly done to wipe out the percussionists.While it's disappointing that it was mixed badly,Jimi's guitar also had alot to do with wiping them out because this band had not worked together long and Jimi didn't have Carlos Santana's way of getting out of the way."
1,Forget it,"Just when you think you're about to see something special, someone drops a root beer in your lap. You wipe up the mess, dry yourself off, and get in time to watch the credits. The thing about this tape is that if someone actually did this, and you did that, you wouldn't have missed much."
4,Simon Wannabes,"I enjoy Sara Evans' music very much, mostly because she is as pure and wholesome as her voice. She is not one of the, what I like to call, ""Stripper Club"". She doesn't feel the need to take off her clothes for someone to listen (doesn't make sense, does it? Most men turn off their ears at the same time the clothes hit the floor.) Sara sings what she feels and some people critiqued her like they are experts. I listen to country because I can understand and relate to the sentiment. Quite simply, I like country and Sara Evans is country. Anyone who listens to her knows this. Some of her music may sound like it crosses over to pop but that's the beauty of it. It jsut goes to show how many more people can and do listen to what she has to say. This album is another extension in the saga of Sara Evans. Don't compare this album to another; just listen and enjoy. I know I did"
2,What happened???,"I loved the Born To Fly album and was waiting for this new cd from Sara Evans with a great deal of excitement. Sadly, that anticipation was not rewarded with anything remotely resembling the highs of Sara's last album. Restless seems to be stuck in a relentless groove of midtempo mediocrity. Even the ballads, where she usually excels, are less than riveting...where did it all go wrong exactly?? The production seems unnecessarily cluttered and it has to be said that the songs just don't cut it. There's no ""Saint & Angels"", ""I Learned That From You"" or ""Why Should I care"", just track after track of endless stodgy averageness.Sara's voice is still as beautiful as ever, but it's heartbreaking to see such a stunning country voice completely wasted in this way."
2,THE CD IS AWESOME,"...If you liked ""Born to Fly"" then you will like Restless. Sara is more daring vocally and has many good songs on her album. The only one I really didn't like was ""Big Cry"" ( I agree with the critic on that one!) But besides that, the CD is AWESOME. I would reccomend that everyone buy it. Sara is going to be the Next Big Thing in country music!"
4,SMALL,"really small compared to description. Its 1.5in ID (inside diameter) and only appx 3/4in deep. However, if you dont use alot of salt when cooking, pinch here etc, this is a great little bowl. The smallness helps with not taking up space. Very sturdy, rubber foot helps on slick counters as well."
2,Just a Cookbook with a unique spin,"This is a useful cookbook for reference, but it is not something that I feel is absolutely necessary in my cooking library. As a regular cook and a breast cancer patient, I found the recipes to be basic modifications of ordinary recipes.If you are struggling with a specific side effect of cancer, then this book does offer helpful organization of foods/recipes for that purpose. It is useful in that way. On the other hand, I think most cancer patients find a core group of foods that they tolerate well, and stick with them through treatment. Also, talking with other patients and reading internet articles has been more useful to me than this cookbook. Sorry -- but I really think this is just another way to market something to cancer patients. We're vulnerable once we're diagnosed, so watch out."
4,Music,I love listening to Loretta's voice. It's enjoyable to listen in the car diving down the road. It's not like the music now days.
5,vary vary good love it and love loretta,i will be getting more of loretta cd . she is a great singer and her song are one of a kind.
3,Adult's Playtyme,"As most of the music industry's 'kiddie' groups that are one hit, one album wonders, Immature had a sound and a style that changed and led them to multiple releases and hits. What makes this album standout is the production and the slow grooves. ""Never Lie"", produced by Chris Stokes (also responsible for B2K, Marques Houston and Omarion) & Claudio Cueni captured the group in a more sophisticated atmosphere with the live acoustic guitar. Young Marques Houston was impressive on the mature ""Constantly"", which in fact happen to be the song that made me purchase this album. Both versions of ""I Don't Mind"" instantly rekindle memories. I wish the Padapella Mix of ""Never Lie"" was on here as well to push this on that other level."
4,Help for congregations ready to be a church for today.,"Rethinking The Church will help congregational leadership review the areas of congregational ministry which need an overhall. Areas include Evangelism, Discipleship, Ministry, Worship, Structure, and more. This book is easy to read, but a challenge to the way church has been done for the last 50 years. Great for church leadership development or even a church planning retreat."
1,Ring of Fire,"The opening song is ""Ring of Fire"" made popular in the early 60's by Johnny Cash. The movie version, according to the end credits, is a duet by Kim Carnes and Jeff Bridges. Sorry it not on the sound track. Can it be found anywhere but on the DVD/video? I've not found it on any Kim Carnes CD. Haven't heard this CD; the one star is because it omits the best music in the movie. What were they thinking!"
1,another bad movie,"I can not understand how bad movies make it to dvd. I've seen plenty on amazon. This movie is very slow ,boring and after wasting your time to get to the ending the screen blacks out you can only hear whats happening. So now I have wasted my time and still don't know what happened at the end. I can guess but do not have visual confirmation. Oh well, on to more slow bad movies courtesy of amazon prime."
2,Deceptive picture,The photo for this product shows the painting pad and the small brush that goes between the boards of a deck. The product I received does not have the brush. Because of this the product was no different than using any roller or pad to stain the deck.
5,Shackleton...,There are few production of Shackleton. This edition by Nova was released in 2005 but was aired on PBS long before 2005. The interviews in this Nova is what the real thing is all about and I am surprised that the brand new DVDs are not on sale and infact not even available on Netflix...
1,In The Garbage,"I tried to use it and the candy would not release. I finally had to cut it out, it is now in the garbage can."
4,It works great,"It works as expected. But sometimes doesnt display a thing if turned off, but you only have to push a button."
3,Sounds like a bell.,"First off, I have to say, when I hit it, it sounds like I'm calling people to church.When I hit it, it makes a really loud ""BOOOOONG"" sound.And then it keeps on ringing for a long time unless you suppress it in some say.On the other hand, it would be great if you were playing somewhere loud. (Hence why it's called a ""Rock"" crash cymbal.)I just don't really like it that much.It was nice and cheap, and fit on my stand from a different brand... but, if I were going to suggest cymbals to people, it would be pretty far from this one."
5,Great book! Great examples!,"This is by far the best book on Palm programming on the market today. The most important part is the examples given in the book. The most critical topics of Palm programming have been covered.Few warnings: First, the book does have a substantial number of typos and simple mistakes. You do have to go to the author's web page and print the corrections list. This should solve the problem.Second, You do need to purchase a full version of Code Warrior if you are serious about doing Palm development.Third, you do need to have good knowledge of C. There should be no surprise that there is such thing as a function pointer.Overall, this is a very good book for an experienced programmer."
2,Don't bother,"Warning: This book is not for beginners. It is a little boring in the sense that most of the book concentrates on programs that have already been written and it examines the most common mistakes that beginning developers tend to make. It does have a couple of really nice examples but unless you are experienced in C programming or another low level programming language, don't count on understanding any of it. Although the author does explain some very rudimentary C, he does not delve into it extensively. All in all this book is helpful if you have the proper background. If you want a step by step HOW-TO guide, don't purchase this book! Instead purchase the ""Learning Palm Programming in 24 hours"" by Sams or the Palm Programming for Dummies book. There is also a lot of concentration on the conceptual aspects of Palm programming. It is educational in the sense that it teaches what to avoid or how to debug your programs."
2,Pretty much outdated by now ... errors and bugs,"The book is pretty much outdated by now. The included version of codewarrior only works with Palm OS 3.5 while 4.1 is out. It supports debugging only through the serial interface, many new palms use USB, which will mean you'll need to get a serial to usb or use the emulator. The starter application didn't work from first time. I'm even pretty much reluctant to continue reading. Requires putting the palm into console mode with special key combination that didn't work for me. I have Palm Zire, with Palm OS 4.1, which is a resonable development platform I suppose."
3,Not much new stuff in here,"I was dissappointed with this book. I already owned Kuharski's book ""Raising Catholic Children"", and enjoyed it. I bought this book expecting it to be really focused on prayer and how to include prayer in our lives as mothers of busy, full households.But really, this book was more of a ""re-hash"" of what was already in ""Raising Catholic children"". It was more of a biography of the author and her 13 children [which is interesting, but I'd already read and didn't need to buy a second book to read about it again]. I didn't see much that was new or that was related specifically to prayer.So, while it is an entertaining book that you will probably enjoy if you haven't already read her earlier book, it doesn't really have any new content or much specifically about prayer."
2,A letdown,"This book had a few pretty pictures, but overall, it was a serious letdown. Another crafter oriented book, without any serious mosaic knowledge. I would recommend instead;Outdoor Mosaicby Emma Biggs, Tessa HunkinTHE ART OF MOSAIC DESIGNby JoAnn Locktov and Leslie Plummer ClagettMosaics : Inspiration and Original Projects for Interiors and Exteriors by Kaffe Fassett, Candace BahouthTHESE ARE ALL FABULOUS BOOKS!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Dire, Dire, Dire","Lots of irritating sex talk, a self absorbed bore for a ""heroine"", two friends who have clearly beamed down from the planet Zanussi! It has two golden ""moments"" in the whole thing. The street footie match, between the hero and the oddball friend, and the moment when the long suffering hero/boyfriend finally gets angry.Aside from these pluses, it is lovingly shot in a kind of golden glow, which gives you the warm fuzzies (and captures Costas to perfection!). A pity, because this could have been good with a bit more inspiration.Strictly for very uncritical Mandylor fans only."
3,Low Quality,"Having already owned a Schwinn, I decided to get the women's version for my daughter, and men's version for my son. I am not at all satisfied with quality of the derailleurs. Photos on the site indicate Shimano Equiped, unfortunately I have Sram. That may not be a big difference, but it does concern me that I did not get what I thought I purchased.I'm am satisfied with the frame, wheels and tires, but for $230, I would expect something better than a $150 bike at wallyworld."
2,Mine doesn't work right!,"This bike is s$#! I can't go from 1st speed to 2nd speed, but I can go from 3rd speed to 2nd speed-wtf? Now I will have to take it to a bike store and have them try to fix it for me-more money that I should of spent on a woman's Trek bike(had one before and had NO problems with that one of course I spent $500) Do not buy this unless a guy in your life or even you know how to fix bikes! You get what you pay for here no doubt."
4,An overlooked good record,"George's Strait discography has always been consistently good. This CD was never much in light, but it is excellent, with even a few gems like the cajun-flavored ""Adalida"", and the moving ""Down Louisiana Way"" which were not included in his fabulous box-set. Buy and listen. Paul LeBoutillier"
5,What is there to say?,How can one describe a work by Ray Bradbury? It is simply not possible for mortals to find the words accurate for these heavenly works. Bradbury weaves his works into heart rending robes of splendor that envelop the reader and transport them to worlds of raw emotion. The Holloween Tree is no different. In fact it is one of the best. It gives you childhood memories that you never had...
3,Mehhh.,Very very very very thick product. Like rubbing glue in your hair. You can only remove product if you shower and shampoo it out. Turns flaky after about 2-3 hours.
2,disappointed,"I bought these insulated tumblers in this and another size. I thought they were pretty and the price seemed good. However, after only 1 week of use, I've had to throw away 1 of each size because of moisture seeping between the 2 layers. And this was with hand washing. Not such a bargain after all. I wouldn't buy them or another product from this supplier again."
5,A little miracle,"I didn't expect the product to do what it did. It brought back the color to my skin on my leg which was rough, dark, and itchy. This is a very good product."
2,Toman and Bowen originated this idea,"Dr. Leman's book has serious research behind the idea, although not behind his work in particular. W. Toman is the authority on birth order, and the late Dr. Murray Bowen of Georgetown, D.C, a father of Family Therapy, expounded on this concept. The idea is definitely not a new one nor the original idea of Leman, and one need be careful of defining absolutes as opposed to observable behavior based on theoretical positions. Family systems therapy has been working with this idea for decades, and Leman has overgeneralized concepts that are best used with professional therapists. He has, however, given a very serious concept the possibility of more widespread attention when one enters into relationships or seeks to improve or understand those in which one is involved."
1,Poor Customer Service,I bought a cross-cut shredder from Royal and it did not hold up. Soon after I bought it the shredder stopped working reliably. The machine would feed paper in fits and starts and usually only half way shred a page. The machine has been nothing but frustration. I recieved poor support from Royal customer service. They hide behind warranty fine print details at the expense of customer satisfaction. I would never buy another product made by Royal. Buyer Beware!
4,Rare book,Six Figures is a rare book that turns the common struggles of marital life into page-turning drama. Any short-comings stem from the books length.
3,How did it all go wrong?,"Most readers will be able to identify with wrong career choices and the feeling of not being able to compete with some of their peers. Some of the plot twists did not seem ""realistic"" but wierd things happen in life."
3,Presley's Stax Trax,"Though labeled a disappointment by critics, Elvis Presley's ""Raised on Rock"" deserves another listen. The King's erratic July 1973 session at the legendary Stax Studios produced a few memorable cuts - represented by the nostalgic title song, the low-down funk of Leiber-Stoller's ""If You Don't Come Back"" and the sublime country ballad ""For Ol' Times Sake."" Another stellar performance is a beautifully pared-down rendition of ""Are You Sincere."" Decent rockers such as ""Find Out What's Happening"" and ""Just a Little Bit"" help offset the occasional foray into Engelbert Humperdinck territory (""Girl of Mine"" and ""Sweet Angeline""). However, ""Three Corn Patches"" remains the worst Leiber-Stoller composition Elvis ever recorded. Clocking in at a scant 28 minutes, ""Raised on Rock"" would have benefited from a few extra tracks, but survives as one of Presley's most underrated efforts."
5,A definate must-read!,"A normal girl living a normal life suddenly experiences a change in her ""normal"" lifestyle, whne she encounters a genie. A TOOTHPASTE genie. And she gets what every child wants: any three wishes granted. What could she wish for? Lucky Charm cereal with only the marshmallows, more toys, more generous parents, a baby sister that didn't make the poops, etc., etc... But what do you do when you only have three wishes? Even more of a problem, what do you do when your wishes come true, but aren't exactly what you expect?This book is a definate must-read for all children. It's a mind-relaxer, an excitement-builder, a humour-filled book, perfect for the good read that you need..."
1,not for fine hair,"my hair is fine and just about shoulder length. These would not stay in the hair no matter what I did.....and the ""window"" for return is gone by 2 days, so I am stuck (was sick for 3 weeks:().........bummed....another worthless gizmo."
2,Not what I expected,The only thing these rollers do for me is give me more body. Its not what I expected and NO I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCTS TO ANYONE.
1,not happy,"Not too happy as rollers do not stay on hair well. Do like softnessof the product, however very time consuming to use (at least for me)"
4,A nice system,"I just bought the Sony Psyc CD Radio and have been very pleased with it. It has a nice compact design and great sound for such a small box. Only one minor complaint, the digital display is a little small. Overall it is a great box for the bedroom or to carry with you."
2,"Good product, Lady Grace is an unreliable merchant","This is a great product with just the right amount of coverage for an undergarment and a layering piece. However, I would recommend you not place the order so that Lady Grace is filling it. I recently ordered from them and they substituted a different item at a higher price, shipped the order to a gift recipient without confirming if the substitution or higher price was acceptable, and they are unwilling to reimburse me for shipment of an item I did not order. Boooo Lady Grace - poor form."
2,intro to matlab by Broenkow,"This book is indeed a basic text - however it misses the mark a bit and is a bit too basic ! For example - in several places the author describes the early development of computers in general and not the development of MATLAB (iam not to sure that such a history would be relevent anyway). Even so, the use of MATLAB glossarys is good and the inclsuion of various M-Files with the CD is a good idea. But what ever possesed the publisher to create the book solely on CD ! This is a terrible format to produce books in - i had to spend 3 days by the printer waiting for the chapers to come out - the additional expense that was incurred by me enraged me ! A collection of PDF files on CD ROM should not cost 25 dollars ! for this price i would expect a text book as well as the cd rom - if this is the trend that will be picked up by publisher then we are all in for some rough times ahead !"
5,recommended for church people,"I can releate to sweet peppers sour grapes and wild flowers since I am a church goer. I really enjoyed reading this book, I can relate to the different personalities in the congregation. It gives me determation to continue going to church no matter what happens.( Church goers, please, read this book.)"
1,"Please, help us fight against the Christian-Terrorists!!","Hello, my name is Rick of the ""Anti-Christian/Terrorist Organisation Of The Intellectually Capable.""And, when I came upon this piece of reaking elephant-waste, I noticed that only four copies were left in stock!!!Since then I have decided to renounce my citizenship as a human.What in god's name are you people thinking?!For every dollar spent on this cd, a child is sexually abused by a priest!!For every half dollar spent on this cd, (as a previous reviewer stated) a terrorist is funded!!But wait! There is hope!!For every twenty-five cents spent on an actual AFX album (Richard D. James), your child will stay rape free for the next year, and for every ten cents spent on an actual AFX album, your nation will stay terrorist free, and bush will be kicked out of office!Help us win this war, and you will be honoured!"
1,Actionable deceptive advertising?,"Like many, I found out the hard way that this was not RDJ. I can remember the days of Milli Vanilli and I am wondering if RDJ won't sue this nitwit if the folks who were duped into buying this can form a class action suit to get our money back from this knucklehead (not Amazon)."
2,Did not live up to expectations from previous reviews,I just flew cross country with this pillow and was not very pleased.The shape is awkward and does not stay in place.
4,love it !,"i got the item really quik, it works great and the video is of good quality. the box is new never used before! i love the series!"
1,Disappointed,"Although, Ignatius Press bills this book as being useful to adults, I found it useless. I bought it to help me determine God's call in regards to various issues in my life.I was disappointed to find that the help offered was very superficial. There was no in depth suggestions for determining how to proceed. Instead a list of various types of work was offered and I was to choose what I thought was most appealing.I am not sure that even a teenager or college student would find this book of much use."
5,Ghost Army WW2 reads like Ernie Pyle revisited 55 yrs later,"Author and journalist Jack Kneece tells the story of the heretofore secret exploits of the 23rd HQ (Special Troops}under Bradley's 15th Corps to deceive German Army deployment by deception, stealth, and phoney troop movements. Landing shortly after DDay at Normandy this 1100 man unit could and did imitate an Armored Division...Via personal interviews with surviving members (from PFCs, corporals, and junior officers)ala Pyle.. the writer depicts numerous events both humorous and serious. Their presence on the flanks of friendly US Army units is believed to have saved untold thousands of lives, both Allied & German. According to Kneece The Ghost Army survivors are still striving to gain recognition of their Unit, let alone appropriate awards."
5,Great Cookies!,"You'll think you are eating Oreo Cookies, but without the fat, carbs, or guilt. I love to finish dinner with a special treat, an these do the trick."
1,crummy eq,this eq is garbage i had one 2 years it quit working one me my first issue i had with it with engine noise going through the rca which the eq been in 2 different cars so both cars i had a issue with engine noise then my volume nob broke and so did the fader and the fader is right behind the volume and in the 2nd car it started clipping allot which i know which it did not had to do with the head unit cause i have that same head unit as long as i had the eq and it did not do that in the first car and not to mention they do sub input by phone cord so you have to get a kicker crossover so i replaced it with a different brand eq and crossover which is better and the engine noise went away so i do not recommend buying this and i know another few people who had the same issue
4,Great stuff!,"This is a great book. Not everything in it is for me, but the few things I've tried so far make it worth every penny. This is for the technically minded, and for those willing to study. It's not a ""For Dummies"" by any stretch of the imagination.If you use GoLive and want to be more productive, this one can help a whole lot."
3,More Info Needed,"Positives: Nice looking book, shiny pages, pretty pictures, easy to follow.Negative: Only teaches you 14 things, does not go over ASP coding only goes over PHP with MySQL backend :(.Even though thebiggest chapter is on dynamic content, it still left me confused being an ASP developer.It also has 2 chapters on WAP technology, which is cool.. but worthless for most people. so that leaves 12 things to learn by buying this book ;)Overall: This is probably the easiest to follow tech book I have ever bought, but it was very lacking in content. I guess if you want quality over quantity than this is your book, but after reading this book.. I just wanted to know more."
1,Pass this one by,An evangelical attempt to lower America's self esteem. Why they want to do this? I can only think that people with low self esteem are more likely to put money in there collection box. People that love themselves in the way God intended won't fall for their ploy.
3,"The good, The Bad and Its also Ugly","It missed several key concepts, though the book is good enough but the author thought some points in the wrong concept. it all appeared a little paranoid to me."
5,George Jones proves (again) that he is cool!,"I grew up listening to the Beatles and Stones. George Jones? He just wasn't as cool as we were back then. Well, I survived the 60's and have actually experienced a bit of real life. And the weirdest thing has happened - I've become a great Jones fan, always looking for something new from the great ""Possum."" The songs on this CD are not new, and Jones has probably performed them more times than even he would like to admit. But listen to this CD and you'll hear new energy in old Jone's voice as he sings alongside some truly great vocal talents from rock to bluegrass. These songs sound fresh and absolutely fantastic. Back in the 60's, who would have believed Keith Richards singing country music with the great George Jones?"
5,Good enough,"It's very confusing to know the battery life. Sometimes, it may be confusing for the new buyer to get used to, but overall, this is a nifty, nice-looking mp3 player that gets the job done. The sync program that came with it is pretty shoddy, so I use Windows Media Player to do so."
1,Don't buy it (zero stars),"Don't waste your money, yes it fits on the celular thread but it is not the same design and after less than a month using it it doesn't remain up."
3,"Excellent food, but lousy build quality","Pro: Food comes out great, no complaints at all about that. I use it all the time and love it.Cons: Build quality appears low, at least on the oven housing. All the plastic trim, including the door hinges, has cracked off. Apparently the factory in China that produced it didn't realize (or wasn't forced to take into account) that any plastic parts had to be heat resistant.A little better quality control, please!"
2,bradley original auto smoker,don't waste you money. I smoked 4 times 2 6hrs. an 2 8hrs. an heating element went out an they go out regular an I used the oak an hickery to smoke my sausage an the smoked sausage doesn't taste like the real oak an hickory. I'm 40 years old an was raised on home smoked meat my dad does still today an I bought this because i'm disabled an cannot go in the smoke house no more an thought this was the ticket but I was bad wrong. So beware this is not gonna taste like the smoke house meat that your used to. Now i've got to find something different
4,Amazon.com is a pain,The thermometer was broken. Amazon.com has been difficult in replacing the broken item!!! Buy direct from the manufacturer!!
2,heater quit,I bought this smoker this spring and the electric heater wont work now quit in september............really disapointing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Bradley BTIS1 Original Fully Automatic 4-Rack Outdoor Food Smoker
1,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Poor Manufacturing!!!!!!!!!!,"We have owned this smoker for about 13 months. We have went through 4 burners with what I would consider regular home use. We smoke about 3-4 times a month. Just this weekend we went to take the racks out for cleaning and the door simply fell off in my husbands hand. Now don't get me wrong the food that comes out of this smoker is awesome, but when Bradley sells a poor manufactured product then will not stand behind it saying that it is out of warranty and wants to charge $53.00 for a new door, and $21.00 for new burners, come on. Do not buy this product!!Put your hard earned money towards a better manufactured product that will last!!!!If you choose to disregard this review- please purchase at least an extra burner to have on hand, we have had to change ours mid smoking."
4,Easy Smoking,"I have my Bradley over two years - It does a great job. On long cooking items you will need to empty and refill the water pan. In cold weather it is hard to get the temp much above 200 degrees, and in the summer about 250 degrees. Wish the heating element would get a bit more heat. Maybe if they could make a wrap around insulated blanket or have a replacement heating element that you could install. I had an element burn out that Bradley replaced at no cost, and they aren't hard to change so a heavy duty element would be nice!It sure beats my old electric or charcoal smoker. Does a great job on salmon, ribs, or Prime Rib!!"
3,An okay movie.,I purchased this movie at my local Blockbuster video store for $2.50 used. This movie could have been better written. You can tell this movie was made on a low budget.The only thing that makes my skin crawl every time I view this flim is when an image of a tuberculosis patient who had blisters or nasty growths all over his body. Yuck! This movie was not scary.There were only two blonde chicks I found to be attractive. The other girls were too skinny for my tastes. Ashley the hot rich stuck-up bitch played by Kristin Novak. She has a nice pair of boobs. In the movie you can see her tits while she is taking a shower. Annie Burgstede who played Tori was also hot. If it was not for Kristin Novak and Annie Burgstede this flim would have received two stars!You are better off renting this dvd at your local rental store. It is not worth buying.
1,Uwe Boll meets Dark Castle,"That about sums up Death Tunnel, which is one of the lamer horror movies in recent years (and that's saying something!) Sure, the concept is neat and there's some good cinematography, but the direction, script, and music-video editing all suck it down until it becomes a total bore. The five bimbos are abysmal and won't sustain your interest - not even in their half-naked states. In short, Death Tunnel won't scare anyone over the age of twelve."
1,Terrible,"As a horror movie buff, independent, and low budget movie fan, I can honestly say this was one of the worst rip off movies I have ever seen. I am from Louisville, KY where Waverly Hills Sanitorium is located, and I am forever fascinated by it's morbid and tragic history. This movie compromised the integrity of everything sacred about that building, not mention ripped off Rob Zombie videos and The House on Haunted Hill. At least The House on Haunted Hill was somewhat tolerable. This, not so much. This film is only for those who like an abundance of naked bodies, excruciating acting, and zero substance ""Girls Gone Wild"" home movies type of stuff."
4,"Actually 4 1/2 stars. All the obvious praise, BUT . . .","I was disappointed that a spectacular collection of 89 tracks couldn't find a spot for my personal favorite, ""Lost in the Feeling"". For that song, you need to look to another collection, ""#1's: The Warner Brothers Years"", with is also sold here.Otherwise, this is a 5-star collection."
2,I didnt get what I paid for,"the item said: 2 beautyblenders, 1 blendercleanser, beautyblender portibility pouch, 1 sample of blendercleanser, instruction cards., plus the bottle of cleanser said that it comes with a pedestal to dry the beauty blender but I didnt get anything like that, yet I get two sponges and the cleanser but nothing else. I tried to contact the vendor but there is not way to do it. No happy with this"
5,Best Thing Ever!!,"Every woman must have one of these to put on liquid foundation, concealer, or illuminating cream. It blends foundation onto the skin very well using only a small amount of foundation or concealer. Super easy to clean. Really the best thing ever!!"
5,Beauty Blender,"I have been hearing about the Beautyblender for quite some time and finally decided to purchase it. I love this product is blends out my foundation perfectly, a flawless finish. I will definitely be purchasing more for my clients."
4,Saves time but not magical,"I find that the beautyblender really speeds up the process of putting on foundation if you only use one layer. Makes the second layer really cakey. Also do not work well with powders. And I like full coverage and this thins out the foundation. I also use this with a Korean BB Cream-did not work as well as using fingers. It is good and convenient, but not as magical as they hype seemed to be.The beautycleanser is amazing though! It gets all the products out. My blender still got stained and the pink fades though it is clean."
1,Not very useful,These were hard to use and did not do much actual cleaning of my glasses. I certainly would not recommend to anyone.
1,Horrible movie,Seriously...the worst movie I've ever seen. I didn't even have high expecations. The plot was minimal (if there at all). Don't waste your money.
4,Odd and compelling,"This is one strange film. It is a good type of strange though, the type that catches you by surprise and becomes fascinating. Recommended."
5,Awesome AWESOME AWESOME,"This is movie is so cool it made me 25 year old , feel like I was high school teenager again. The movie is unpredictable funny, and not what your expect, I am so happy that I watch this movie. going to tell all my friend and like it on facebook :) :) :)"
5,Awesome Movie,"This movie is absolutely amazing! If you like random stuff, time travel, blood, cussing, fights, and some partying then you will love it. I have to say, I did get a bit confused toward the ending, but in the end it all tied up. You may have to watch it a couple of times to get it to all make sense. I'm a big Josh Hutcherson fan and when I first saw the trailer, I wasn't so sure it would be good. But then I watched some clips from the movie and then I got interested. I bought it from Amazon and it arrived on time, plus the price is good. I totally would recommend this movie to my friends and other Josh Hutcherson, Shanley Caswell, Spencer Locke, etc. fan because it is awesome. You should get this movie, it's worth it."
1,detention,Didnt ebjoy movie at all.big fan of dane cook movie wasnt what I thought it be. I rather watch sleep away camp
3,Silly silly crazy movie!,It was awful but I just love Josh Hutcherson so it was worth the money. I never watched it all the way through.
2,A little disappointing,"I purchased this book to read for a book club that I am in. Another member had chosen it, and I was willing to give it a try. I am a mystery reader and I guess I was disappointed when there was no big event that happened to drag me into the story and keep me interested. Nice family dynamics, but a little slow."
2,no Close Caption,"The movie itself is FIVE STAR, but without Close Captioning it is worthless to me, as I con't hear very well."
2,NOPE,Tale of a pair of godparents who hate each other and end up having/choosing to raise the child of their very good deceased friends. I found the humor average and a lot of this was about the funny moments of raising a baby and such. It failed to hold my interest past 25 minutes. WHEN WATCHED: today; OVERALL GRADE: C minus.
4,Enjoyable,I thought it was charming and thoughtful. A big surprise. All the actors were well suited for the roles they played
4,Cute Movie,This is a pretty cute movie. I love the lead actors and they do a great job. Entertaining and worth watching.
4,I actually liked it.,"Life As We Know It starring Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel is a sweet and moving romantic drama. I'm not a big fan of Heigl and Duhamel, but their performances were shockingly good. The plot of this film is similar to Baby Boom and Raising Helen, but with a twist. The supporting cast is great as well. This movie is a little too long but I liked how the love/hate relationship between the two leads played out. And the little girl is absolutely adorable! This film was a pleasant surprise, buy or rent today!"
4,Cute Coming of Age Plot,I was surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. Life as We Know It addressed several adults issues in a comically intelligent way.
3,"Predictable, all funny moments given away","If you've seen the preview for this movie, you've seen all the funny moments. Boy and girl can't stand each other, boy and girl are forced to be with each other, Boy and girl fall in love."
4,"So sweet, but predictable.","I really enjoyed this movie, the characters are funny and the situations provide for lots of comedy amongst the pain. It is of course very predictable, but if this is your criteria for movie watching you'd only watch 2 movies a year (if that!). The love story is very sweet, although obvious from the start. The neighbors are hilarious, there are a couple of eye-candy worthy actors and absolutely no reason not to watch it once. Your man shouldn't even mind it too much, there are sports, lady-chasing, and some generally attractive actresses. All in all, the story isn't the same as other movies though the outcome is, I'd say worth the watch."
1,Waste of time & money,"My wife and I wanted a light comedy to watch and she selected this movie based on the average 4 star rating. We realize opinions and tastes vary but I cannot fathom the overall praise this movie garnered. The characters are unlikeable and vapid. The child is very cute but honestly all you feel is pity for her inheriting these two messes for ""parents."" Plot and outcome are uninspired and predictable. Acting is wooden, and beyond the child and ""Dr. Sam"" you can't find a sympathetic character. Frankly watching this poor child crying all the time was rough; at her age the tears are real and all you want is someone to help her; baby dropped, baby shoved down, baby ignored, baby crying over wasted rental--ok, the last one was me. Both my wife and I felt that giving this one star feels like a gift."
3,Great movie,This arrived at my house on the date that it said. I was a cute movie and I am glad I bought it. Reasonable price.
4,Great movie!,"This was a great movie! It was a nice twist on a romantic comedy! It wasn't the normal boy meets girl and falls in love right away. Not to spoil anything, but it takes a little longer and it comes out of a odd and twisted relationship that becomes a great friendship. But I liked it a lot!"
4,Read the entire book,"The book is well written, if a little repetitive. The most important point (the last chapter, Lessons Learned: Closing Thoughts), is that parents need to make the decision about what their children can read and by reading the book for themselves, first, parents can make a more informed decision for their children.I've read the other numerous negative comments about this book and hope that the readers finished the entire book and did not get weighed down in the middle. Abanes made several valid comments in regard to the Harry Potter books, especially its use in public schools as classroom material. At the end of his book, Abanes explains biblically, how Christians are called to treat others, which includes those whom disagree about the value of the Harry Potter books."
1,Give it up,"Let me tell you that i only read ths book out of curioustity and not beause think that Harry Potter Teaches anything bad.To all the Anti-Harry Potter people I would encourage you to read something like ""the gospel according to harry potter"" or another book like that. Maybe it will changethe way you view Harr Potter."
1,i cant believe this guy,"i think this is the craziest thing i've ever read. why would you ever think that this book is about bringing kids to the occult? its a book that entertains kids! it has gotten kids to pick up books and read again, and the genre opens up many more doors to other books that are just as good if not better. not only does it do that, it has opened forums for children to chat on. intead of sitting around doing nothing, people are online, thinking and talking about theories for the next book, and analyzing the books. i dont see how this is bad, and i think Abanes is just trying to stir up trouble...."
1,Fits Badly,"I was shipped a case marked, ""Kindle 3."" The description was for a ""Kindle 4"" case. If the shipment was correct, the case is way too big for the Kindle 4. It's nicely finished in a pebbled leather surface with nice stitching. Just too large for the Kindle 4."
3,A solid bike with a few shortcomings,"This is a bike that will get you where you want, but not with pizzaz. The Pacific Singe is a bit smallish for larger riders and a major shortcoming is the close location of the front tire to the pedals. When traveling at low speeds (requiring a larger front handlebar movement), the front tire will collide with the rider's feet. This needs to be re-engineered as it could cause a crash.The suspension is surprisingly effective for such an inexpensive bike. I was also impressed with the handling and brakes at higher speeds.It's a solid bike for smaller riders."
1,NOT COMPATABLE with Toshiba e310!,"I just got off the line with Toshiba. Their Pocket PC's are NOT compatable with sandisk SD's. No fix in sight. I bought three at once and two are dead now. They work for a while, then you start getting error messages, then they die. Toshiba needs to post a warning about this!"
4,San-J Wakame Broth,"Very good, exactly what I expected. Must be a real lover of the flavors of the sea to appreciate. Great for a quick & easy snack or side soup. Very high in sodium, but worth it."
5,Classic,"Classic Mary! I love all the songs. Can hear JOJ, K-Ci ,and Faith evans on Background Vocals. Back when artist worked together. A must have for your Mary J. Blige collection."
5,I Think This CD IS All That,The CD is about How to love and how to be in love and by listening to the CD you can tell thats Mary J. Blige was in love and has been hurt like all other women who has been hurt. That why I can Relate to this women and her songs the same thing she been in I Been In A I like to say thank you for your music and your love to share with hole World I Love You Mary J. Blige.
1,Two WD800 HD failures at 2.5 year mark,"I must concur with the previous negative reviews of this HD. My husband bought a Western Digital 80G HD in spring 03 and the motor failed Dec 05. My computer came OEM with a Western Digital 80G in Summer of 03 and it failed 2 wweeks after the other one. Motor again. Drive had 20+ gigs of wedding and baby photos. Irreplaceable. Both computers were UPS protected and medium to light use. Mine was 100% original, used only for email and photo storage (and a little solitaire). No power robbing add-ons, no ventilation issues.If your data is important to you DO NOT BUY this drive, and I would question any WD product if this is how they handle a defective product. I have no axe to grind other than the failure of these two hard drives."
2,"Fast, quiet, but 3 of 3 have failed","I have had all three of my JB series drives fail on me. One or two might be bad luck but all three raises a red flag for me, especially since I have about a dozen Maxtor drives, IBM and Seagate drives, Western Digital BB series drives, and old Western Digital Caviar drives that have outlasted the three JB's under heavy use.JB#1=boot drive in multi-drive system, heavy use, lasted 9 monthsJB#2=boot and data drive, infrequent us, lasted 6 monthsJB#3=data drive, moderate use, lasted 8 monthsJB#2's replacement, has a ""slow"" spot that diagnostics won't error onI will say Western Digital's RMA service is good, if you provide your credit card you will get a replacement drive to salvage.I can only recommend these drives in a RAID 1 (mirror) system."
2,Went bad in 1.5 years,"Dell Diagnostics Tools found problem in the drive six months from the date of purchase. But Western Digital did not accept that since 'their' Diagnostic tool did not find any problem. Drive developed serious problems in 1.5 years (this time detectable with Western Digital tools too).Since Western Digital provides 3 year warantee (unlike Maxtor and Seagate), I got the drive replaced. They shipped the new drive fast. The replacement drive (refurbished) died in two weeks (!), resulting in complete data loss for me.Of course, nobody takes any warantee for data, not even those who provide backup software that can fail to restore!I have never used Maxtor or Seagate, so cannot say if those are better. Dell originally gave me 20GB drive (again Western Digital). 2.5 years old but works great!"
3,Low in Rise,"I am 5'7"", 265 lbs. and ordered a size 22 in black and white. I love Tan Jay clothing, but found these capris to hang low in crotch area. This is very annoying - I am constantly pulling them up (perhaps if I alter waistband?). They are beautifully made but the londer I wear the more annoyed I get. The material has no stretch to it so when you sit down the legs and hip area are tight - no give. I really should have sent back."
5,Wow... A potential mega band,"Not the future I ordered by Blue Shift is, in my opinion, one of the best revelations / new super band in the last 10 years. I have been hearing music for more than 20 years, specially prog/symphonic/rock , and this is one of those band that caught my attention since the first time I heard them. They simply blew my mind. Just listen to the first song and you will see what I am talking about. This song alone worth the cd.Even though the influences of bands like Yes and Kansas are there, I find Blue Shift very original and unique. Nothing That I'd heard before sounds like Blue Shift.If you are a prog fan you can't go wrong with this cd. It's a must for any prog collector.I guarantee you won't be disappointed"
3,A little dissappointed...,"My 11 month old daughter loves for me to read her most of her Boynton books... I bought this set and was dissappointed to find that the only book that ""we"" really enjoy is Moo, Baa, La La La. The other books aren't really for reading neccessarily, as far as story time goes. She does like to look at the other books in the set, but I was looking for more bedtime books to read to her. If I'd viewed the books before I bought them, I probably wouldn't have purchased the whole set, just the one book.Volume 2 is great though, we do love the Boynton books, they're her favorite!!!"
5,My Son Loves these Books,I bought these books when he was 1 now he's 2 1/2 and he still loves them. Has multiple memorized. They're simple and fun books.
5,Great box of Boynton's,I bought a box each for three little grandchildren. They are great books as are most Boynton's book. Cute stories and great pictures. Mom and child will all like these stories.
2,Entry Level Book,"The bottom line review on this book is as follows: If you are already playing and performing for several years this book is not for you because there is nothing new that you will learn from it. That being said, there are many things in the book that I learned through trial and error. If I had a book like this when I started out it would have helped me out.If you are just starting out and you are searching for information that will help guide you on the path to your tone I would recommend it to you.Therefore, I will be loaning this book out to my begining guitar students as a way for them to start thinking about their tone and a way for them to start asking questions."
5,A splendid rendition,I have listened to various renditions of the Brandenburg Concertos for years. In fact I had a number of recordings of the works prior to my purchase of this example. It happened that I was viewing a T.V. program of classical vignettes when a portion of this magnificent performance was aired. I was enthralled and immediately searched the web to discover if a DVD presentation was available and here it is! It would be impossible to find a rendition as fine as this one. The most exciting part of it is the performance can be VIEWED as well as heard. The focus on the reeds was enchanting to say the least. Bach would be proud.
3,The basics but nothing amazing,"If you are looking for things like individual bank misfire data or O2 data then you don't want this unit. If you want a well made, simple to use ODB2 code reset and minor diags, then you will like this product."
4,Con job saver,"You can check for any emission problems before going to the inspection station and save the $95 per hour they charge if any show up. Most are minor and easily fixed or covered under warranty which they wont tell you. One ""check engine"" signal solved and you have covered the cost of the scanner.This one is exceptionly easy to use."
1,Disapointing,"Tool is overpriced and doesn't provide the ability to review live data, which allows drivability testing."
5,The best price.,"After much searching and comparing prices, once again Amazon came through with the best price. They even bettered my local brick and mortar shops.The Equus 3110 ? Just about the nicest for the cost. It is so feature packed, it will carry you into the next phase of OBDII systems. Unlike the latest computer system, that once you buy it, it is outdated as soon as you turn it on."
2,Damaged packaging,"The outer box and the inner packing box were both in good shape when this arrived, but all four bags in the inner box were torn or had holes in them. The contents were spilling out of both boxes when it arrived. On a positive note, Amazon refunded the purchase price promptly."
2,Like everyting else these days- garbage,"The previous reviewer said that his feet got cold after and hour or so.Thats being generous; these boots can't keep your feet warm for five minutes even if the temperatures well above 20, especially if you aren't walking. If you plan on standing at a bus stop or doing something else where you are going to be more or less stationary forget about it. They aren't waterproof either. i had these same problems to a greater degree with Colombia's Gortex winter hiker, can;t remember the model name. I exchanged them for these. Like every other company these days, Columbia is selling crap and keeping their fingers crossed that you won't return them, and that you will blame yourself for being cold and not the boots."
2,Classics in the Classroom,"As a classroom teacher of all levels (honors, gifted, and Advanced Placement Language and Literature courses during the past thirty three years, I feel this book was a disappointment. Its title belies its contents. There was nothing new and inspirational for students that do not at least introduce an innovative new concept. I have been ordering from Amazon and keeping abreast with classroom texts for more than twenty years. I wasted my funds on this one."
1,This book was a bunch of BS,"I am currently studying DID and this book made me furious. From the case notes from March 30 1981; ""Ms. Casey clearly has periods of dissociation."" So immediately she diagnoses her with DID??? There were no alter personalities present at the time she diagnosed her with this disorder. That is a KEY symptom for the disease. She should have left the Dx as Dissociative Disorder until a month later when ""Renee"" emerged (how interesting that an alter emerges after she is already told she has DID). Then in her brilliant Plan 1, the author decides to ""Reread Three Faces of Eve and Sybil and see if I'm on the right track"".Sybil and Three Faces of Eve were great books but many have considered them to be exaggerated or even fiction. Why wouldn't she consult a diagnostic manual approved by the APA? I wonder if her early (and possible mis-)diagnosis affected Ms Casey's prognosis."
1,Worthless,"You get what you pay for. This is a very cheap calculator. Nine of the ten number buttons work just fine. Unfortunately, I occasionally have the need to enter a zero, so the calculator is pretty worthless to me, but it was so cheap that it is not worth the trouble of returning."
2,Samsung Omnia 7 GT-i8700 DuoSuit (Jet Black),This case makes your camera button useless. It's impossible get a good picture because the plastic don't let you use the autofocus. Loses the sensibility.Try to find another thing.
2,E-3's,"I spent a geart deal of money on these - for workouts/running. While the sound is unbelievably good the durability is unbelievably poor.I have gone through 5 (yes - five) pairs in 18 months. Every time the right channel shorts out, even though i try to keep them as dry as possible from persperation. While Sure has replaced them it is too big a hassle to keep sending them back. Buy something more durable if you want to use these in the gym or for running."
3,Triple.fi and SE530 are MUCH BETTER,"If your considering buying these earphones, I highly suggest you take a look at the Ultimate Ears Triple.fi 10 Pro or the Shure SE530. The Triple.fi's retail for the same price($399.99) and according to EVERYONE, the Triple.fi walks all over these. If you want Shure's, the SE530s are AMAZING! earphones which are $299.99 now on this website but retail for $499.99. Choosing between the Triple.fi 10 Pro(more refined-sounding) and the SE530(more full-sounding) depends on personal taste, but both easily surpass any other earphone on the market besides the custom molded Ultimate Ears UE-10 Pro(THE BEST) which retail for $900.00."
4,Radio Friendly Techno,Good album.. lots of popular trance/techno tracks that will appeal to the masses.. but DONT get fooled into thinking that Louie DeVito is some wicked DJ... read carefully.. digitally mixed... that aside... this CD is a great introduction to electronica.
5,"Absolutely Amazing Sounds! Where is Vol 2,3,4...?","I bought the version of this album that also includes the DVD video shot during the Winter Music Conference in Miami Beach. The Music compilation is awesome and the video is very entertaining! Includes club scenes, South Beach street scenes, and a good review of events during the WMC. I have reservations for WMC 2010. Buy this album!"
2,Aspect ration 1.33:1?,"Say it isn't so!!! Who in their right mind make ANY movie in that format anymore? I don't care if it is a ""kid's film"" (I'm 55 and love ""kid's films,"" so sue me!), with more and more people owning widescreen sets, any film in 4x3 aspect ratio is a crime against humanity.Say it is a mistake from amazon's side.*NEWSFLASH! Apparently it IS a mistake. Someone kindly informed me about amazon's mistake. Thank goodness."
4,Grandson liked it!,The movie was vey interesting and kept the attention of my 6 yr. old Grandson through-out. He is a big Scooby Doo fan and asked to watch the movie a second time!
4,It's Blu-ray!,"The series seems to be slipping a little, maybe they have different writers or something or m,aybe they're just running out of ideas - at least its better than Music of the Vampire movie ):"
4,First Person Exposure,"Bob Karnes is clearly a talented writer, suggesting that he has been writing in private for some time. While my usual preference is for fiction with strong story lines, he makes this book work in its High School yearbook format by sharing his vibrant memories of relationships and events from adolescence. Being a near contemporary in Northern Virginia (but not an Oakton alumn), I could resonate with the music and political issues he recounts. I could immerse myself in Karnes' world.However,.... Karnes needs to find another editor. His old classmate apparently shares Karnes' confusion over the proper use of ""I"" and ""me"". The constant misuse of the first person pronoun was so jarring that it prevented me from enjoying several sections."
4,New Style,Transitions blends together the harmonies of R&B with the rythmatic beats of Gangsta rap. Its a new way of listening to music whether rap fan or r&b. This group should go far picking up support for both sides of the fence. Ghetto Laws is really dope and I can't wait to hear the upcoming album.
2,If you've got a weak stomach...,"A Terrible Beauty is a ritualistic-serial killer mystery that is probably pretty good. My husband liked it. But I was unable to get beyond the first 70 pages because, by that point, the sadistic, graphic details just proved too much for me. There are some images I don't want in my head. So I gave it up, but that doesn't mean other readers won't enjoy it. You simply need a stronger stomach than mine, I suppose.Just a word of warning to others who don't fancy this sort of stuff."
4,Great First Telescope,"I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it -- and so does the whole family. The views of the moon have been absolutely spectacular -- it is the first time I have seen individual craters with my own eyes. We've also gotten glimpses of Jupiter and Saturn -- glimpses only because of high winds and some thin high level clouds.A couple of notes. If you want to look at the moon, you'll need to get a filter. It makes all the difference in the world. I never thought the moon could be too bright, but with this telescope it is.The telescope was relatively easy to assemble, but the instructions were confusing because the written description did always match the photos.If you're a novice stargazer, I highly recommend this telescope.."
1,Bad equipment. stay away...,"This is a kind of bad copy of some original equipment. The tripod is weak an unstable, the adjustment screw does not work and it never fix on the target you are trying to see. As all Chinese products, it is just a piece of joke. I'm considering to ship it back..."
4,Minor Inconvenience,"The only problem I had was aligning the spotter scope to the telescope. Also, make sure you know that you'll be able to see the rings of Saturn and the four Galilean moons of Jupiter, but little else of an astronomer's interest."
4,It is a very good option to start,"It is a very good device to observe the moon, for planetary observations, I think it's complicated.If you want to see the moon at the highest magnification should be able to hold your breath, because any movement makes it difficult to observe at high magnification, this due to the tripod that comes with the telescope.But for people just starting out, is the best option."
2,flimsy mount,"Got this telescope for hubby's Christmas. Flimsy mount, difficult to align, eye piece too loose for focusing. Worse, he's owned it only seven weeks and one leg failed, collapsed onto backyard concrete patio. Now we're having problems with customer service at Celestron, not promising replacement telescope with new warranty (for what the warranty is worth). Before you buy, remember that if you need to return the telescope, YOU pay shipping both ways. Disappointed with the brand."
2,Be aware customer service sucks,Customer service is not very good. I don't want to go into the pain I had getting a replacement part but it finally came today. This was a Christmas gift for my wife. The replacement part has a part missing to it!! I'm not exactly sure what is going on at Celestron. Just be cautious when buying their product.
4,Be aware this is for Nikon cameras.,The description does not specify the camera vendor.These lenses will not fit Canon 20D and Digital Rebel XT.These lenses for the Nikon cameras only.Had to return them.
5,Great Fun!,I loved this series when it was on and this was not only fun to re-visit it but to share it with my daughter.
2,This one confounded me.,"I was waiting to read the story of Faith the last of the books of Benning, Texas, but it was slow to the point of dragging on and on. When Faith gets together with her husband she had run away from she instantly knows she is pregnant ... right! ? Even if this were possible the way it is written is to simplistic as Faith would have had some more serious feelings about the occurance. Max, being a man, can't make the ultimate sacrifice and move to the place she has come to love, but has to return home to his business which we are told his brother is capable of running inspite of the fact that throughout the story we are lead to believe he'd be happy raising horses. And, even though he assures Faith his wicked witch of a mother will not both her every again the reader would have to be naive to believe it."
1,broken piece,The top of my salt box was broken when it arrived. I have had no success yet in trying to contact shipper to get a replacement. I want a refund and/or a replacemt.
5,Fiction Based on Reality,"This is a believable, insightful yarn based in a real world setting spun by an author who has ""been there - done that"". Most can identify with each character as someone they know or have met and not necessarily in the service. Sit back and enjoy it. Be prepared to gain some insight and to be intellectually challenged in the process. ENJOY."
3,Hidden Meaning.,"I like the song, but yes considering how young this girl is, the lyrics are disturbing...but wait till you hear other songs like Playground and Perfct World. Plus maybe I am the only one who remembers that the phrases #1 and #2 also refer to going to the bathroom...#1 one for pee pee and #2...well you know where I am going with this!"
2,"Senn E835 - muddy, congested mic","There are 4 mics to consider in the $100 price category: Sennheiser e835, Shure SM58, Audix OM-2, and AKG D5. I've been doing sound for 10 years. Each has its own faults.Senn: lower midrange congestion -- like you have a cold, warm-sounding, rolled-off highs. Very muddy sounding, but will add more ""body"" to your sound.Shure: cold-sounding mic, highs better than Senns, some mid-range muddiness.AKG: overall nice sounding mic. Problem when you ""push"" the mic, i.e. sing loud. Mic feels like it has a delay in it.Audix: very nice sounding mic. No major sonic problems. Nice, extended highs. It's the shadow of the awesome OM-5 ($250+) which is faster and has even better clarity.My advice: go with the Audix OM-2, or spend $200+ for an Audix OM-5 or Senn 935. Both high-end mics sound very similar."
2,"They sould be called ""lukewarm"" rollers","These seemed like a good alternative to a full-size roller set for travel, and they are BUT they don't heat to a hot enough temperature to curl. A real drawback for HOT curlers to be tepid. I once let them heat for 90 minutes and they still weren't hot. I would award them no stars but the posting software isn't permitting that."
1,Not very practical,Nice case for protection but if you're playing music and try to snap the case shut it will pause the music or switch songs because the snap is positioned right over the toggle switch. I wouldn't have purchased this if I had known that.
4,EFC Season 2,It arrived sooner than I expected. There is a clutch in the DVD's that it doesn't consistently show the names of the episodes when you want to select a specific episode.
5,Earth Final Conflict Season 2 Box Set,The show in its second season was very good. Although the creators sacrificed intellectual sophistication for impressive action. Its worth seeing but I wouldhave preferred it if the show stayed true to the style of season one with WilliamBoone instead of Liam who seems way too perceptive.
5,Hold on tight or you might fly off,"Sean Drommond is back at his wise-cracking best. His next assignment has him defending an ""obviously"" guilty general, who happens to have married Drummond's old girl friend.Drummond brings on board a most unconventional co-counsel that would just as soon scratch his eyes out as assist him in his case.The old girl friend seems to still have the hots for Drummond and her filthy rich father still disapproves of Drummond.The case is going poorly, but Drummond figures he's doing something right when people crawl out from under rocks and try to kill him.This is another winner.Brian Haig is on my must read list."
5,loved this book,I really loved this book because it was fun and interesting and it taught me exactly what I wanted to know. I thought the writing was clear and so were the examples. Do more!
3,Good Foundation,This book was very informative and gave me a good foundation to build from. The book includes many exercises with the necessary files available on the CD that's included. A trial version of Fireworks MX is also included on the CD which would save download time if you didn't have a copy.I feel the order of the chapters and information presented could have been better organized. There are a couple of spots where the author refers to topics as though you should be familiar with the subject that hadn't been discussed. However once she covered the topic later in the book I felt comfortable with the topic and tools.This is a good book for the beginner.
1,RedHat Linux 7.3 Bible,"I have the Red Hat Linux 7.2 Bible and this book is full of errors. It has very shallow information and has caused me much griefin my pursuit to learn Linux. This book is totally useless, today I had to look at the credits in the front of the book and see the names of the morons who contributed to this books publication. Eachproject I started using this as research had serious problems and flawed solutions. Incredible 1040 pages and a big fat zero...."
2,Weak,"Although these headphones produce high quality sound, they are very quiet. I have a pair of $5 basic headphones that play music louder than these. If you are somebody who prefers to listen to something at a low volume these are probably good headphones, but if you are somebody who likes it loud and powerful then these will disappoint. I got them to watch movies on my laptop but I'm having trouble hearing the dialog sometimes even at full volume."
2,All bass all the time...,"Pro: I really prefer the fabric covered ear pads. Very comfortable.Con: The sound of these headphones is very disappointing.The package says ""Enhanced Bass"" and the bass is definitely enhanced; to the point of being ridiculous. These provide indistinct, throbbing, muddy bass that makes you ears hurt after a short time. You can correct some of this with drastic EQ settings by why should you have to do that?Other users say that a 12+ hour break-in period helps, but if anything, that made things worse.I think this is an attempt by Sennheiser to satisfy the same people who think good sound means rattling windows....quantity instead of quality.If you think over-driven car stereos that make the ground vibrate are cool, these are for you. But if you prefer balanced sound with rich bass, look elsewhere."
3,Doesn't fit an adult's head!,"Price was great. The sound was ok but, very low, even cranked all the way. Too tight! Uncomfortable within moments! Not sending back, giving to a kid who is happy with them and has a smaller head."
4,Great value for the money,"I've had these headphones for about a month now, and I've been pretty satisfied with them. I'm always listening to music at work or walking to school and whatnot, and needed something that might end up taking a beating, so i didn't want to spend a lot. I also have a pretty big head (hat size close to 8""), and these headphones are adjustable enough to make them comfortable for me. I hate short cords on my headphones, and needless to say, 10' makes sure it's not a problem...in fact, I end up stepping on the cord at my desk sometimes, so I try to keep them bound with a rubber band or tie-tie. They come with a belt hook to wind up the cord on, but I never keep my mp3 player in my pocket, so it's pretty useless. All in all a good value, for rock, hip hop or jungle (which is what I mainly listen to)."
1,Scared my 3 yr. old,"This book really scared my 3 yr. old. It made germs seem scary, but also called them invisible, which made her feel insecure. We have been up with her almost every night for the past week because she is scared of the germs. It didn't help matters that she got a runny nose a few days after her preschool teacher read her class this book. Now she is convinced that an invisible germ snuck up on her and made her sick. Not a good book. I think the illustrations of scary germs, mixed with the photos of the real little girl made my daughter think that these germs could really ""get her."" I do not recommend this book, especially if your child is sensitive!"
1,Donna,"We can see the stars infront of our house, and on our balcony with our naked eyes. However, no stars through the telescope.There is something wrong with this telescope. We only see dots. I will call the company soon...or get help somehow before I return it."
5,Worth the hype!,"I didn't purchase this from Amazon and am reviewing for the product only. I'm a male, don't color my hair BUT I like/love tingle. It's a bonus is that this makes my hair extremely soft (yet not heavy or oily), smells mild/nice and has a good ingredient list. As of now, this is my favorite conditioner on the market!! I really, REALLY like it. The only con is maybe the packaging--it's a bit feminine, which could put off a male buyer. Who really cares though?Note: if you are purchasing based on this review, assure that you're purchasing the Hydrate Conditioner and not the Hydrate LIGHT Conditioner, which is good but doesn't have the tingle."
3,Not Great for the Money,"This product was highly recommended so I gave the shampoo and conditioner a chance, but for the expensive cost of the products it really doesn't deliver much. I have fine, straight hair and it made it limp and frizzy at the ends. My less expensive drug store brands do better than this costly product. Not worth the price in my estimation."
4,Whiskey Train Rocks,"Great 60's and early 70's band featuring the great ""Jimi Hendrix Like"" guitar of Robin Torwer. It is worth the price of the CD just to hear Whiskey Train. Very seldom heard on the radio, this tune is a hidden gem and if you love guitar, you'll love this song. Scott"
1,"This is not the ""real"" Patsy Cline","Beware, this is not the actual Patsy Cline but a recording of the stage show ""Always Patsy Cline"". Many of the songs are cut short so the on stage actress can cut in and continue her story about the life of Patsy Cline. After listening to this CD once I could not ever imagine listening to it again."
5,Marvelous!,"This album is clearly in the genre of Le Jazz Hot originally formulated by Stephane Grapelli and Django Reinhardt. Wrembel is a virtuosic guitarist, and his side men are with him every step of the way. Great stuff."
5,Good overall,"Very good box with great sound. This boombox is designed to be played loud, the woofer kicks in at higher volumes, and reproduces low frequencies well and clean. Great to have a line-in input, this works great with portable MP3 players. A little on the heavy side. Excellent value."
4,"Sulu, Rand, and Excelsior. Need I Say more?","Under the influence of a virus masqurading as a memory engram, Tuvok recalls his days on the Excelsior under Capt. Sulu. A beautiful companion to The Undiscovered Country. Fans of Sulu will love this one.Would have rated 5 stars if it were not for the contrivance of Tuvok's illness. I would have rather seen it done as a straight story about Tuvok's role on the Excelsior."
2,It...STUNK,"Do not, I reapeat do not buy this video. It stunk. Q was the oppisite of brilliant as usual. Then a Q civil war, like Janeway cares. Horrible, absolutely horrible. I'll never buy this, I'd rather watch orional Star Trek."
1,"Ugh, what a mess!!","This is a classic example of a lame ""Lameager"" episode. Taking something from the Next Generation and messing it up, the hallmark of a dismal Voyagaer episode. And the plot! What a disgrace. The whole ""Q"" thing is kind of like playing with dynamite for the Star Trek writing staff: Do it right and it is a thing of beauty to behold. Do it wrong and there is is a big bloody mess stuck to the walls. This is an example of a ""Q"" story blowing up!!"
3,bike,"it came fast but the problem is that the part that was broken, the crank that attaches to the pedal, is 12 weeks out. I haven't gotten to even sit on it yet."
5,English dubbed,its about time its in english (stereo) this is the beginning this is the beginning of the final battle with pain sweet
1,Not so easy for me to install...,Based on the previous reviews I order 2 of these items to use in my home. On the first install I was able to get a good signal one story away but after rebooting my laptop I could not get device to install properly. I keep getting unknown device. This was on a Win 98 SE system. I also had the same results on a XP machine that I was also planning using them on. Instead of trying to tweak it so much to force it to work I opted to buy the netgear version which matched my router manufaturer. Plugged it in and no configuration needed. I'm new to wireless and been in the computer field for almost 20 years. I think keeping the same manufaturer on these items is probably a good solution for beginners since this technology has become econimically feasible for home users to use. I don't have time to fiddle with pnp devices that are suppose to work right out of the box. Just my opinion.
4,Never have I been excited about a vacuum cleaner,"After having a bad vacuum for a year, I decided to try this one out. I'm not an accessories person, so I don't know about how well all of those work for folks, but the power on this thing is insane. My carpets haven't been this clean since the day I unrolled them! I pulled up carpet freshener that was put down months and months ago - that's how strong the suction is on this thing. The first run through the house maxed the dust cup, and I'll admit that I'm actually looking forward to using it again. Lift off canister - love it. Super flexible hose - love it.The only negative that I have for this - hence the 4/5 - is the weight is a bit awkward. Sure, the power helps pull the weight, but it is a little heavier than other machines.I would recommend this product before its completely phased out."
3,Good vacuum if you don't use the accessories,"The vacuum itself does a great job on my carpets and picks up way better than my equivalent Hoover. My disappointment comes from the attachments. The lock on the extender arm broke with the second use. The suction brush attachment stops working every time I use it on the stairs and we have to get out the screw driver, take it apart and unclog it. The canister goes on and off easily. I always manage to spill some dirt while emptying it. The canister is very small and with 2 dogs, I have to empty it after cleaning every room.Complaints aside, I still turn to this vacuum before my others because it can really suck up the dirt and hair."
5,I could read a thousand Hamish Macbeth stories and still want more,"Och! How I love a good Hamish Macbeth mystery. They may not be filled with profound or flowery imagery or obscure literary references, but they always tie up the loose ends. They at least make sense. Hoorah!For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal."
2,LA Guide,"I purchased this guide to replace an old LA Guide I have had for 10 years. Although it mentions some interesting things to do, directions and lack of maps showing freeways, etc. are a big minus. I would not recommend this guide."
2,Too much exaggeration,"The contents in this book are not really new. The author tends to exaggerate things quite a bit. Examples in the book may be true, but grossly sensationalized and hardly applicable to any real world case."
4,southpark rules!!,"this movie is the coolest one yet, cartman should recive the oscar for this one. southpark is a very mature yet funny and everybody can learn something from it, if they just botherd to watch!!"
4,"Good episode...not perfect, but good","Though this episode of Voyager isn't one of my favorites, it was interesting to watch. Mulgrew and Picardo excel, with the rest of the cast lending a hand at Janeway's ""memorial service."" It is quite similar to Waking Moments in the way the sequences air-you think they are the real parts of the episode, but it turns out that they are only fiction. The idea of the Devil coming in the form of Janeway's father is intriguing, and it reveals about Janeway after her father died. If you are a fan of Captain Kathryn Janeway, then I would recommend buying this episode."
1,Avoid if you value your CD's,"I bought this CD player about a year ago.What a mistake!The trouble started when the CD player started putting CD's back into the wrong slots. It would place a CD into the slot next to where it had taken it from - even if that slot already contained a CD. As a result a CD jutted up from it's slot and was broken as the carousel turned.After this the player would not play at all.I had owned the player for about 2 months at this point, and was required to take it in for warranty repair. A month later I received my 'fixed' unit back.Not trusting it I began putting CD's only in every other slot. Effectively turning my 300 disc player into an overpriced 150 disc player.It was fine for a while. Then it started dropping CD's into the body of the machine.It is no longer useable as I do not trust this machine to not destroy my valuable CD's.As this is not my first problem with a Sony product, I will be avoiding the brand from now on.Do not buy this machine."
4,Listening to MP3's,I am enjoying this product though not able to interact directly with the internet: it works well and plays MP3's burned onto CD's beautifully.
5,Super!,"I've had mine for four years, and never had a problem. I use it every day, often for hours on end. I love that I can store my cds in it, and it's very easy to use. I think it's just great, and would buy another in a heartbeat."
2,great for awhile,"The sony 300 cd was great for awhile then one day""table error"" I looked on line for this issue and ended up taking the unit apart. found a small rubber belt off under averything. Fixed it put it all back pugged it in ans it worked! so we loaded the cd's and then hit play and then ""table error"" so now off to buy a new non sony product. If you use electronics for a few years then replaxe them this is the unit for you, however do not movve it with cd's or you will get the infamous table error and end up buying another product."
3,unhappy,"the product works fine it is slow in it's functions. But it works. What I am unhappy with is the service I got from Amazon customer service. I got this 400 disc player and no instructions, no remote, no hookup cables nothing but the beat up box and the machine. Their responce was ""return it"" I asked them to help me get the missing items they quit responding. Customer service in action. NO HELP The machine was to be a gift I explained this and that I did not have time to return it and get another one especialy since they were going to charge me to return it. {shipping} Thank You Signed NO HELP AT ALL FROM CUSTOMER SERVICE"
3,Met expectations,"I was not happy that the box arrived in its regular box - the Christmas surprise was spoiled, since the name and description were in huge letters on the side of the box. We are pleased with the amount of storage, and the ease of adding the CDs. We have, however, experienced some sticking of several discs as they play. We are hopeful that will not be a regular occurrence."
2,Ok as long as it works!!!,"I am now sending for my second replacement refurbished unit from Sony - that makes three in total that I have owned.I originally bought brand new several years ago. Worked fine for 3-4 years. Then it began to have the problems described by other reviewers - skipping tracks, skipping discs, getting discs stuck in the player module.I paid $119 for a replacement refurbished unit. that was in February. It is now July and the replacement unit is having major problems. Can't use it at all.Called Sony. They are going to send a another refurbished unit at no cost but this time I pay for cost of shipping.This would be a nice system if it did not break down after a few months. If you get one hold on to all warranty documentation because you will need it."
4,"V.Hoang, Thanks for the Tip!",I have a 400-disc changer we've had for several years - no problems at all! Someone gave us another unit that skipped like crazy; then I read V.Hoang's review and tip about putting something heavy on top - it works like a charm! Thanks again - I love the Internet!
1,If Only I Could Rate It Zero Stars...,"I bought this a year ago and it worked ok for a few months and then the skipping started, and continued, and got worse. Now, it will give us a random day here and there of unnterrupted shuffle play, but most days it skips or gets stuck and ceases play. We use it in a store and it is so frustrating to have to stop working and run up to the third floor to try to get it working. Once it starts skipping it will not usually stop so we end up using the radio. Very annoying and surprising considering the quality of all my other Sony products. DO NOT BUY THIS CD CHANGER!"
1,Sony blows.,This CD player holds all your Cd. Generally is does't play the first track. Over time it just gets worst. Try another manufacture.
1,Disappointed in product and service,"In December I ordered a Sony CDPCX355 300-Disc MegaStorage CD Changer from adgtron. When it arrived it didn't work. I contacted adgtron by email. ""Too busy, it's Christmas."" they said. Later, they called my home phone and left a message to call 954-482-5599. I called 5-8 times. Each time, leave a message. I left numerous messages. No response. I also emailed them several times. No response. What am I to do? I am out my money with a piece of junk that doesn't work. NOtice, I rated only one star because it would not allow to rate it a 0. Why would I rate them anything when nothing is happening.Roger Heintz"
2,Not a great quality machine,I chose this machine because of past experience with the brand. It is noisy and emits various none intended noises. Was easy to return with Amazon.
1,I wish I'd have read these reviews before buying the unit.,"We bought this machine for a Christmas present for the inlaws, knowing I'd wind up installing it. The first disk played fine, but while I was eating lunch my father-in-law tried moving to a different CD. It wouldn't play. It'd go back to the first disk and play it fine. So, I shut it down, restarted on disk 2 and now it played fine, but wouldn't go back and play disk 1! I moved the disks around to other slots and still they skipped like an old-fashioned vinyl record with a scratch. Both CDs worked fine in another player. In the meantime, mother-in-law is busy putting her collection of CDs into groups for me to program.Not this holiday season. This sucker's going back to the big box store from wence it came!"
3,"Not Our Favorite Thomas book - a review of ""The Special Delivery""","This should be a favorite book. It has nice artwork and features many of our favorite friends: Cranky, Thomas (of course), Gordon, Harold the Helicopter, Toby, Percy, James, troublesome trucks (quantity = 2), Sir Topham Hatt, and Bulstrode (shown in the background)...... BUT for some reason, it is not that popular with us. We liked ""Thomas Goes Fishing"" and ""Thomas and the School Trip"" better.Three Stars. [C+] Good artwork. Nice Read-aloud. But something is lacking. Perhaps it is that the tone is not as sweet as the other aforementioned books."
3,"Donkey Kong ""Lite""","This game is okay if you want to play the classic NES version fo Donkey Kong. A much better alternative, however, is the GameBoy version which came out in 1994, which I purchased then and which has received an immense amount of game play in the last decade from me and my family and friends. The 1994 version has all four familar levels and then continues Mario's chase of Donkey Kong out of the 1920's era big city and into the forest, the jungle, the desert, and other locales, and is to me the definitive version and I always hoped Nintendo would do something similar with Donkey Kong, Jr. but to my knowledge they never have."
2,One size fits all??,"I was happy to get what I thought would be a perfect bike, at a great price, and when it arrived, I had only a few minor issues with the assembly. But then I realized it was way too small for me--my feet hit the front tire on turning. I measured the frame--17 inches. I would need a 19 inch frameNowhere in the product descrption is there an indication of frame size, or any warning that there was no choice; so beware, if you are six feet or more, this will be much too small, and it might be too big for shorter people."
2,"Uhhhh, What's Up Doc?","What's up with the price of this product? It's an ok item as a novelty, but it isn't worth the money paid for it, waaaaaaaaaaaaay over priced!"
4,helpful,"Obsessive compulsive disorders can take many forms, as this book acknowledges. Indeed, the object of obsession/ compulsion often seems arbitrary - compulsion is a drive which can ""cathect"" (to employ psychoanalytic jargon) almost anything. I found the book useful in addressing the problem of obsessional letter writing and the attendant gratification of seeing one's name in print. I came to realise that this was in fact a symptom of something that it is not the place of this review to divulge. However, this book is not in itself enough and readers would be advised to read it in conjunction with therapy."
3,Long and Skinny,"This bunny has a little different look than I expected. It's very long and skinny. It's cute, but just not what I had in mind. As far as the construction, it's well made although delicate. I wouldn't buy it for a infant or toddler."
1,Most worthless piece of crap printer ever.,I'll concur with most other reviewers. Takes forever to start printing. If you don't print every day then you'd better use the head cleaning utility before each print (which wastes ink). It knows if you're using non-original cartridges and I suspect that it treats them differently. Original cartridges are very expensive and don't last long. I'll never buy Epson again.
1,Cartridges are expensive and tiny,"Yes, the printer is certainly noisy and shakes the table underneath it. It makes nice copies, but the ink ran out so fast! The cartridges are very expensive and hard to come by--as a matter of fact, because the ink ran out so fast and I had to wait on more cartridges--it brought my home business to a standstill for three days. If you buy this printer, buy a box of cartridges to go with it--you'll need them."
1,Piece of cr*p!,"This printer has yet to print a decent page. It CONSTANTLY needs to have the print heads cleaned, and even then you have a 90% chance that it will leave horizontal bands through your text and pictures where it skips. On top of that, it needs ink refills faster then any printer I've ever had. Don't waste your time or money. I'm ready to trash it and get something else."
3,It's ok...,"I recently lost my Epson Stylus 740 due to a mechanical failure. It was a great little printer with no problems during it's life span. I bought the Stylus C60 based upon it's rave reviews and I am finding it not to be so great. First of all, it's really noisy. I can't emphasize it enough. If you are like me and you spend a lot of time on your computer, this will really bug you. The first time it ran, I jumped back. The printing job is no better than the 740. It's decent. I haven't printed on photo quality paper yet to really test the quality. Being a knock- around printer, I don't expect it to be wonderful for photos. The noise level is so irritating that I almost don't care how it prints. Consider this review a fair warning..."
5,Excellent Printer Paper,"This is a very bright, white paper with enough thickness (4.3 mil, 24 lb) that you can print on both sides without seeing through it. Compared to most other ordinary printer papers, this is definitely superior. And at about the same price as cheaper papers as well.My usual previous favorite was Kodak Bright White, which apparently is no longer made. This Epson paper is quite similar.For the price, this is THE paper to use for everyday printing."
1,Not actually epson paper,"When I received this package I realized the box was missing its top. As I looked over the packaging I realized the box was a older Epson paper box, and the paper inside was not even close to the quality of Epson Premium White Paper (I had another real box to compare it to).Someone had just taken cheap plain printer paper and placed it in a opened box and passed it off as Epson."
2,have to agree with the others,"This paper is really not worth its price. I fail to see anything even remotely special about its brightness, weight, or overall quality.For important printouts I use the Epson High Quality Ink Jet Paper (sold in packs of 100 sheets), which is pretty much pure perfection. This ""bright white"" paper would not be good enough (by my standards, anyway) to use for a resume, for instance - there are too many imperfections in the paper itself (like, specks of stuff in it).We used to get a low-end Quill brand at the office, and I think *their* paper quality was more consistent.Also, it wasn't packaged tightly enough - quite a few pages got crumpled around the corners because of that, and the boxes themselves were ripped around the corners."
2,500sheet package white print paper,"i believe that i paid too much for this product. comprting pyoducts are just as good for significantly less.This us quite good quality print paper,however, and I beleive that you can count on that,if necessary"
2,Broke,"I've had this tripod for 4 years and have handled it carefully, but one of the leg clamps broke and pretty much rendered it useless. Can not recommend this product."
5,Shure Stylus Force Guage,Nice product. Simple balance-beam construction and clear instructions. Should be all that the majority of vinyl fans need.
4,Very Helpful,Although I have a gram index on my tone arm this was very helpful to dial the stylus weight in and confirm.
3,Don't use with moving coils,"As mentioned in (surprisingly) only one review, this device is magnetic. I've had one for many years and only noticed this when I tried it with a moving coil cartridge. Perhaps this is why Shure sells this - they do not make moving coil cartridges. With a moving coil cartridge, not only would the results be extremely inaccurate, but there is a strong risk of damaging the cartridge irreparably."
1,"Slow, slower and slowest","I don't know how much stock i'll put in these reviews. After reading the few on this one i purchased the item in DVD form. Its terrible. The plot , is there a plot , drags on and on.It was merciful when the sorry excuse for a movie came to an endThrasher"
3,Joe Deserves a Box Set,"I love Joe Walsh and the music on these disks is great. My only real beef is this seems to be geared to the casual fan. The only rarities are The Bomber, with his nod to Bolero, edited out on most collections, and a live take of Ordinary Average Guy with Glenn Frey. Who needs Glenn Frey? Give us some previously unreleased material. I hope there is some in the vaults and that one day Joe will get an extensive anthology."
5,Very good movie!,"Sassy, bitchy, scary and good-looking--Sorority Row more than pleased me since I wasn't expecting much. And when I read that this was yet another remake of an older fright flick, I was ready to destroy it.Surprisingly, it proved to be lots of fun and the string of murders were amazing. What I liked in particular, besides the really excellent performance of the whole cast, was the terrific musical score b Ken Seng. The pounding music worked perfectly the hidden violence that explodes when you don't exp3ect it.Director Stewart Hendler moved things along smoothly and never let things lag. As an old timer, I just wonder if college is as wild as depicted in the movie since my glory day back in the early 60s were still in the Pat Boone and Doris Day style of living."
2,Not worth spending your precious money,I was dissappointed with this product. Frankly my notebook inbuilt speakers are better than these. I dont know why Altec want to spoil there brand by having these kind of products around.Unless someone wants to throw his money in drain don't go for this
3,generally OK,"I bought this CD for one song that i remembered from the ninties, Sister. A great mid-nineties song that got some decent play back in the day.The remainder of the CD has some pretty good tracks and some pretty average tracks. If you like the middle ninties post-grunge sound you'll like the majority of the CD."
1,So BAD!,I reluctantly bought this CD on recommendation of a friend whose musical taste I (formerly) respected. What a waste of my hard earned money. This noise hardly passes for what any sane person could consider to be music. I tried to sell it at my used record shop but they already had three copies so they wouldnt even buy it! I wish I could have given this 0 stars.
5,That's the way I like it,"I feel I owe Judith Van Gieson a special thank you for giving her readers consistently excellent novels. Ever since the Neil Hamel, and now with the Claire Reynier series, I've enjoyed her well defined, genuine characters, no nonsense plotlines as well as her remarkable ambience-rendering of the Southwest. The author sense of time and places proves once again right here. As a woman in her fifties, Claire Reynier has already had a share of ups and downs. She has settled for the best as a rare book expert at the Univesity of New Mexico and a life of her own spent between books, Tai-chi, a potential lover and a cat. When she becomes the prime suspect in the murder of a former classmate, she has to dig into a long-forgotten past and go through some sobering discoveries. With her sharp reflexion about what people really are about behind the scene, precise but thoughtful writing, Judith Van Gieson brings a definite plus to the mystery genre."
3,My commuter !-),"I bought this bike off craigslist for $125 in 2007. The frame is great. Strong and nimble but a bit heavy(dual suspension). I use this bike as my city commuter and average 10 mi a day. I want to upgrade most components.Pros:Smooth rideComfortable positioningCan be set up for higher performanceNo flats yet(2+yrs)Tough enough for all city terrainLooks goodCons:The warning sticker that states ""Not intended for off-road use""Broken bottom bracket within a year(cheap fix)Chain ring gaurd broken w/no available replacementAll in all this is a lot of bike for the money. I'll probably drop another $400 to make it right(including internally geared rear hub, slick tires(Conti City Tops), and single-gear 48 tooth front chain ring/crank set).Bike to work!"
3,Didnt really connect to my experience,"I had hoped that this book would provide comfort and spiritual revelation. However, it did not meet those objectives. Its really just a collection of bible verses separated into categories. Respectively, Pastor Jakes applies pat responses to serious issues that single Christian women experience. Overall, I didnt feel moved."
3,Easy read,I enjoyed the book. It was an easy read as well as encouraging. It's a reminder of the things we should already know and practice.
5,A Treasured Book for Single Christian Women,"Written in a devotional-type format, this book provides encouraging Scriptures on issues such as healing, happiness, overcoming loneliness, and forgiveness."
2,Very poorly written,"This book is about a great topic ~ Day Trading. The author(s) seem to be relatively knowledgable but fail miserably to ""make it happen"" in this book. Full of spelling mistakes, capitalization & sytax errors, and very bad cliches, it is hard to find a chapter with reasonable, intellectual flow. The graphics are poor and there is absolutely NO COLOR GRAPHS which are vital in reading Level II NASDAQ tools. In short, I have read it and would not recommend it to anyone with higher than a fifth grade education. In fact, it is the worse book on the topic I have yet to read."
4,great book,it's a great help for foreign students to find a good M.B.A in the united states and offers all that a foreign student how to live while his studing
5,Great for the price,"I was going to order check envelopes for our company, $750.00 for 5000 envelopes with our logo them. I figured it was worth giving these a try. The envelopes work great. The payee is clearly shown through the window and the logo on our checks shows clearly. I figure most people/companies receiving the check are more concerned with what's in the envelope versus a fancy logo on the outside. You can't put a lot in these envelopes, a check and maybe a stub. Great buy."
4,humility of a visionary wins followers,"The Paradox of Power has actually transformed the ideas about a leader. Pat has mentioned of seven paradoxes, most important of which are certainly absolute love for your followers as Jesus had for his twelve non-schooled disciples, a vision and preparedness to 'accept inaction as the best form of action' and 'silence as the most powerful speech' at the appropriate time.His examples selected from the life of John F. Kennedy (talking to a mines worker), Robert Lee make his musings on desirable traits of a true leader as given in the book, more acceptable and laudable,"
4,Lots of Fun for toddlers,"I bought this for my daugher when she was about 15 months. Since we live in a townhouse without a lot of outdoor space, it was perfect; although originally intended for our patio, we kept it inside. The other reviewers are correct, the swing is only good until about 2 1/2 years, depending on your child's height. However, I removed the swing and she still uses the slide (she is almost four). I had no problems putting it together, with sturdiness, or with missing parts. I wish the swing lasted longer, but I guess it was designed with smaller children in mind and it may not have fit in my house. The only unfortunate part is that I have to convince my daughter that we must get rid of the slide so Santa will have space for new toys."
4,Baby loves his new swing,It was a birthday present for my son who just turned a year old. It was easy to put together and he loves being able to swing. Even his older sister who is two is able to play with him on it.
3,Swing is too small!,My 1 yr old got this as a gift from her grandfather. The problem is that now that she is 1 1/2 years old she is waaay too big for it. The swing is an infant swing so to claim that this is good for 1-4 years simply isn't true. The slide is also very small. She's reached the bottom of the slide before she even starts sliding. I know it was expensive so I feel bad throwing it away since her grandfather spent a lot of money on her but the bottom line is it isn't any fun for her anymore! Also when they do swing in it the whole thing moves around. I would recommend something more exciting for kids. This should have been a $35 dollar item.
3,Not impressed for the money spent,"This products age range should read 6 -14 months. My 16 month old loves the slide but wants nothing to do with the swing. She is already into the bigger swings at the park that swing higher and faster. This swing would be perfect for younger babies. Again, she does love the slide. I do wish the slide was longer though, pretty short.We did dettach the swing so she just has the slide to play with."
2,Slide is great! Swing is a waste!,"I purchased this set for my 15 month old daughter. This set was very easy to put together. It took only 20 minutes.The slide is great for toddlers & my daughter loved it.However the swing has no range of motion. Maybe the swing would be good for a child that had just turned one for the summer, but it's worthless to any older child. It's also not large enough (in height) for toddlers.This set is too expensive to just use as a slide. So this was packed up & brought back to the store."
4,Great toy if you are short on space,"We got this for my daughter when she was 15 months old. She immediately fell in love with it but had a really hard time climbing up to the slide. To get up to have to use the climbing wall and its quite slippery and doesnt leave a lot for their little feet to grip on to. now that she is 19 months she is a pro and loves climbing up, looking out the telescope, sitting down and yelling GO, GO, GO! before she slides down. She also likes the swing which she fits into fine (and she is 90th precentile) but the range of swinging and the fact that its on poles not chains doesnt give for a fun long term swing so she doesnt stay in it very long. Still during our superbowl party all the neighbors got together and we had 5 kids ranging from 16 months to 3 1/2 years and all of them were kept busy for a veyr long time playing on this swing-set. Definitely worth it for the money if you have limited space."
3,The age on the box is wrong!!,"Because the box said 1-4 yrs, I bought this swing for my 2 yr old..Big Mistake!!! The swing is for a child 5 mos old and the slide is very short! It is waaaay too expensive to just toss so I took it back..even after putting it all together. If your child is between 6-12 mos it may been great but nothing older!"
3,Unsure whether to keep it.......,"My husband and I just assembled the Swingalong Castle for our 18 month old Daughter. She loved the swing and slide but I am not very impressed with it. When I swing her the whole thing slides around. I tried to find a place to put sand but I didn't find it. It is a great concept and was not difficult to put together. The claim that it takes 20 minutes is untrue but it did not take too long. I am just unsure that I want to keep it. For the price, you would think that it would be a little more stable. The only thing stopping me from taken it back is telling my husband to take it apart. That though is another story.........."
3,Just buy the slide with rock wall,"We bought this for our 15-month old son and he loves to climb the rock wall and slide down the slide.One complaint is that this is lightweight - my son pushes it around the room! We keep it inside because we don't know how we could anchor it outside.Also, the swing must be uncomfortable, because my son will not sit in it.I recommend buying the slide and rock wall combo - without the swing."
1,Garbage,"The name is right ad aware......becasue it gives you more of them and crashes your unreliable, buggy Windows OS easily."
5,Fine Tales Set In Ghana and Brooklyn/Bronx/Long Island !!,"Needless to say, my favorites were the ones set in or near Zongo Street, in the West African nation of Ghana (formerly Gold Coast). Here we meet a bizarre assortment of thieves, prophets, bullies, tea store owners and their overweight wives,taxi drivers, ghost masquesaders, and many others, including many not much different than you and me. All these tales are beautifully done and just about perfect, and there is some of the zaniest humor you will ever encounter. So, for some really different world literature, why not press the button, and order this collection right now?!"
5,Outstanding video wish it was longer...,Outstanding video. They hit all the highlights of the fall of Eben Emael. Sad story and a life lesson on preparedness!
1,disappointed,The tiles for this game are far smaller than I thought they would be. I bought it to go on a beach vacation but left it home because the tiles would be so easily lost. I have the original version of this game and found it enjoyable. I was disappointed in the quality of this version
3,Minature Fun,We took this game on a cruise but you could not play outside because the tiles are very small and the wind might blow them away. Inside on a table they were fine.
1,Great for scrapbooking.,"I recently got this travel size game and was suprised how small the set is. It's too small to really use it. The tiles and the trays just make it to difficult to manage the itsy bitsy tiles. However, I found the tiles to be perfect for scrapbooking!"
5,Buy it,"We have a full size Rummikub but wanted a travel version for, would you believe, when we travel. Tiles are small but that's the whole idea. You could even use this to play the game on an aeroplane table. It is so neat - we love it. Excellent game and excellent size - the travel case and everything about it, is excellent. We keep ours in a small plastic bag so that we can put the spare tiles in there whilst playing.Don't hesitate, buy it."
5,Tiny but served its purpose and was fun,I bought this game to take backpacking. Our regular Rummikub is too big and heavy to pack in. This miniature version was just right. I took along a dark colored bandanna to set the game pieces on. That kept everything under control. The pieces are quite small...like the size of a large fingernail. We played in the tent when the mosquitoes were bad outside. It was a lot of fun even when we had to use our headlamps at night to see the game pieces.
2,Shure M97xE phono cartridge,This MM cartridge has a warm sound and good presence-best for older vocal music.It seems however to deliver a lesser output than the specs quote-about 30% lower than my several other MM cartridges-but not a major problem for my Sony CD burner to deal with.Good value for the price.
2,A cheap Cartridge,I mounted this cartridge (SHURE 97x) in my turntable DENON-500M (MX135+MC-252+B&W; 804D) and have been so disappointed with its quality.Once you use another cartridge like Denon DL-110 you could easily get the same conclusion. I tried to test it by listening few classical music lps as well Peter Green (old FleedwoodMac) and some Jimmy Hendrix LPs. I could tell Shure 97Xhas a weak bass and there is a lack of clarity between different range of frequencies.
4,Makes Vinyl sound great! But will you notice?,"If you have a chair in your house designated for listening, like to sit, truly absorb and think about music, then this little bugger is worth the upgrade. If you are a more passive listener, then you probably won't notice any difference. For better and often times worse, it reproduces the original sound source very accurately. Be patient and work your way through some favorites in your collection. You will find that well produced recordings sound phenomenal. You will also start to notice problems in some of your favorites never noticed before, specifically in the mid-range. Old or new, 180g or not, it makes no difference. It all has to do with the quality of the original source material and who mixed the material on recording day. It's like this; if you watch a non HD broadcast on an HD TV it looks worse than it did on your old TV. If you pop in a Blu-ray, then WOW! Well it's the same situation here."
2,Distorted,This cartridge was too loud on my turntable. The loud sections of music were distorted. I also noticed a couple of copper wire strands sticking out the rear by the connector pins. Looks like it was assembled in a hurry. I'll be returning this and stick with my Grado Black cartridge.
3,nice sounding cartridge,I compare this cartridge to a V-15 type 4. At first I thought there was an audible difference. But then I edited together segments from one song played on a Technics SL-1200 MK2 turntable alternating which cartridge was used. Then I had trouble telling them apart by sound alone.
5,m97xe,"great sounding, inexpensive cartridge for my old tt. replaced an old, old, a t cartridge. minimal investment, big improvement in sound"
3,Pleasant but simplistic,"This is the first book of hers that I have read. I would probably not go out of my way to pick up another. Beth is a likeable character and I was somewhat engaged by the characters and story; however, the plot seemed a little thin and simplistic. The ease with which she located all of the key players after years of being out of touch was a bit unrealistic."
3,Good for beginners,"If you are just getting into disc golf, this is the book for you. Helpful hints and lot of good information."
3,Rainy afternoon reading,"This is the kind of novel that might be called slight. It's short, light in tone and content, but readable and atmospheric.The book is written from the point of view of the girl herself, a quiet, thoughtful home-loving character who is socially overshadowed by her attractive and more wordly sister. It tells the story of a young girl going to her first formal dance. The action takes place in middle-class England somewhere in the early part of the twentieth century. It vaguely recalls the world described by Jane Austen, writing about a similar social scene 100 years earlier. The writing also has some of the delicate observation of Austen but lacks Austen's ironic touch.One of the merits of the book is the author's carefully-observed and convincing characterisation. Another - as with P G Wodehouse - is the evocation of a time gone by. No masterpiece, but an enjoyable piece of writing for a rainy Sunday afternoon in front of a log fire."
2,"If you like OTR, don't buy this player!","I have a large collection of Old Time Radio CD's in mp3 format. Most episodes run 30 minutes. This player breaks the episodes into 3 minutes chunks and pauses for about 3 seconds mid-episode, -sentance, -word, etc. It also does not display the ID tags for these broken files. This one is going back. I have not had a chance to evaluate the anti-skip protection, but the interruptions mid-file are too annoying."
2,VERY VERY LOW QUALITY SOUND !!!,SHAME ON SONY ! - I HAD FOR 4 YEARS MPPLAYER - MPMAN CD350 AND THE SOUND QUALITY WAS GREAT ! I PURCHASE THIS MPPLAYER AND THE INSTRUMENT ITSELF IS GREAT BUT THE SOUND ?! IF ONLY I COULD TAKE THE SOUND OF MY MPMAN PLAYER AND PUT IT IN THE SONY THAT WILL BE FINE ....THE BASS IS WORSE THEN A 50$ MPPLAYER ! I HAVE SONY'S EARPHONES MODEL - MDR-EX71SL AND THEY R GREAT EVEN WITH THEM THE SOUND IS TERRIBLE !DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT ... SORRY SONY THAT I'M DISAPPOINTMENT .
4,Sensational Writing,"This book holds so many different topics and ""feelings"" that I found myself experiencing the various emotions called for.I was happy, sad, confused, angry, smiling, crying, and taken aback, all in one book. The poetry shows the ever-changing accounts of life as we know it, and brings a lot of what is written home to the reader."
4,"The Skin I'm In is an awesome book, it tells how life can be","The Skin I'm In is a great book! It tells about a young girl in seventh grade, Maleeka, who is African American and gets teased a lot. Her father passed away and her and her mother are very poor, so Maleeka relies on her ""friend"" for fashionable clothes to wear so that she doesn't get made fun of even more. Maleeka's new teacher, Miss Saunders, helps her along her journey of succeeding. Read The Skin I'm In and let it take you to an intersting place, to a place you'll never want to go to."
3,The Skin I'm In recommendation,"The Skin Im In is about a 7th grade girl named Maleeka Madison. Her teacher is named Ms. Saunders but sometimes a lot of problems happen between them. Maleeka has a whole bunch of friends named Char, Juju, the twins and even sometimes Ms. Saunders is her friend. A boy named Caleb in a way is Maleeka's boy friend.Some problems happen in the book like Maleeka's friends and her want to get back at Ms.Saunder's so they go to her class room late at night and messed it all up. Maleeka and her frinds ran out of the class, but do you know who got caught..... In my opinion I love this book because of all great action. I recommend this book for any age. So please buy this book only just above 6.00. Find it at any book store in your local town. So I hope you buy it!!!!!!!"
3,Not like they used to.,OK for a cheap cartridge as a scratcher but not nearly the bottom that the old (pre 90's) Shure's had. If you want sound get the higher priced Shure.
5,Best Cheap Cartridge,"By cheap of course I mean 25.00 delivered. For anyone wanting to get back into vinyl, or simply enjoy the existing collection, or just looking for a different musical experience, which is vinyl, check this one out. It is rugged, has an elliptical needle, sounds good without being muddy and will make you happy.Forget about the Audiophile stuff for a minute. Those who spin records with 10K systems will consider this cartridge way too elementary for their tastes. Those who love music for the sake of music will love it.Big fun without a serious investment. Be prepared, you might catch the vinyl bug. Way more potent than the avian flu."
3,Not bad for a Voyager episode...,"This show was in trouble from the very first episode and it never quite got over its slump. Hammy or bad acting and goofy plots often make the show a painful viewing experience. Here is one example of a fairly good Voyager episode.Time travel stories seem to be one of the standard plot lines in Voyager (along with those abysmal holodeck-themed stories) but this is one of the better ones, if not the best one. The big negative is that ""Future's End"" has a Gilligan's Island style ending; where they wind up stuck back in the Delta quandrant for no GOOD reason.I should have expected that ending, it is ""Lameager"" after all."
4,"Tiny, good, but not great","I needed a pocket radio for walking - and this does the job. I want to pick up the local NPR stations, which can be a little difficult because there are higher-power stations nearby on the dial. This radio is tiny (yeah!) and I can get the stations I need. There is some interference from other stations - but there is on my clock radio at home, too. Controls are easy to use."
1,Pathetic,"While I don't entirely disagree with all of Willimon's ideas, the arguments he uses to convey them are truly pathetic. He goes on pointless tangents and employs faulty logic. Buy Borg's _The_God_We_Never_Knew_ if you want a much better book."
4,Good quality and color safe,"after having my stylist sell me this product twice, I started buying it for less at Amazon. Not that much less, but around 20% less than salon pricing.I like this conditioner for a light daily product. It doesn't weigh my hair down, doesn't mess with the color and my ultra dry locks are again feeling normal. The hydrating shampoo is truly awesome. It's made a real difference in my hair - it used to feel dry and split. These products do not make my hair feel brittle nor lifeless. I'm still using the same brand of coloring too."
1,"Not that ""natural""","It's too bad but this product contains parabens--methylparabens in this particular item. I wish they could leave these things out of so-called safe, natural products. I like Pureology, but can't use it knowing this--sorry."
2,Voyager takes a stab at the Ferengi,"Well, if you just LOVE the Ferengi, I'd say jump right on this episode of Voyager. But I certainly wouldn't call it among the best Ferengi episodes in Trek (those reside in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine series), nor would I call it a particularly strong Voyager outing.In this episode, the crew of Voyager comes across a couple of Ferengi who have been in the Delta Quadrant for some time, scamming an entire civilization by posing as gods. As in all Ferengi episodes, there are some humorous moments...but I honestly feel that at times, the episode drags. The ending was pretty good, but that does not make up for the silliness during the mid-section of the script.If you want Ferengi, go check out one of several DS9 episodes. If you want outstanding Star Trek Voyager, look to one of the other episodes."
3,More than I imagined,"When I heard that the author was from Zambia I doubted his ability to weave an intricate tale. After reading this book I am impressed with his writing ability, his analysis of the corporate world, and oppression of women. I recommend this book to all. I plan on it being a regular purchase for family and friends, and look forward to another work, by Mr. Munyemesha."
3,"Interesting, but much too short","Buddy Ebsen seems to be a very nice person and writes fluently. The beginning of his life is quite well described, but I would like to know a lot more of his later TV series and movies. It was a bit irritating to get only a few stories about his later life. The font of the book was a large one. There are a lot of pictures, which are good but lessen reading. Thus one could read this book very fast. Maybe I am too harsh, but I believe he could have much more to tell about his life and especially about making those series and films. It is worth reading, though. But prepare yourself for a very short book."
2,Not as expected,"The utensils have a nice build quality. The nylon is well cut and the idea of having a silicon handle seems to work well.However, this same silicon insert is not well locked on the main nylon body. They have different flexibility and the insert usually comes off when cooking.That really annoys me."
1,Sony's MP3 capability falls flat,"This is a nice looking unit with good sound and what I especially liked was the sleep timer. I listen to old time radio MP3 CD's when I go to bed and thought this unit was too good to be true. It was! The MP3 capability sucks. Evidentally it will only play MP3 files burned at certain bit rates. Most of my MP3 CD's would not play with this unit but all play on a much cheaper unit. The sleep timer was the most important feature to me, but this unit is a loser because the MP3 capability falls flat!"
2,Soundtrack of our lives,"Great tunes of my life, the 80's as a teenager, then the 90's, trying to grow up.Travel with me as we listen to West End Girls at high school parties, because it's the ""new song"" to listen to. Sitting in the high school parking lot at the high school because our DJ was too nerdy to play this. We drank our beers and jammed to our little JVC stereos.We hated Loverboy and Bryan Adams, wanted something different.We found the PSB. Dance, Love, Dance, Think, Dance, we got it , why couldnt anyone else?"
5,Seeing things?,"While traveling, Voyager enters a part of space that is less than welcoming. While negotiating across it, the crew begin seeing people from home and fantasies about eachother. Is this a natural phenomena? Is the crew going crazy? Or is there more going on here?"
3,A Kes episode!,"I'll admit that I absolutely hate Kes, and was glad to see the back of her, but this is a decent episode that centres around an evil politican (aren't they all evil?) who takes over Kes' body so he can use it to get control of his homeworld. The evil Kes character is wonderfully played out, Jennifer Lien really does ooze power and authority when plaining the villian.All in all a good episode for Kes with a new twist to the 'my bodies been taken over by an alien' storyline."
5,Wonderful book for rhyming fun,Great book to use in pre-school-1st grade children. It has good rhyme and story about the crayons talking.
3,"Where's the ""Detective""?","This is the second in a series of Adirondack Detective series and it's hard to say if it's better or worse. Briant spends more time with personal matters (the upcoming?? wedding) and other things (Patty's surprise one-year anniversary from being abducted). But he seems to be doing less detective work.In book 1, he is instrumental in solving the central crimes in the story but in book 2 he's relegated to a middle man.I still think he could do more with the descriptive Adirondacks, though his flights with his friend Dale are more descriptive than in Book 1.Our ""hero"" tends to be very meticulous - to a fault. I sometimes wonder what Patty sees in this guy!Despite the above criticisms, I still think it's a decent read. On to #3!"
2,Order incomplete,"This product seems to work ok, but seller didn't include part of package that was advertised."
1,No on/off switch?,"I would not buy this product again. My unit emits a constant electronic hiss even when all controls are in the neutral position. As far as I can tell, there is--incredibly--no switch that disconnects battery power when the unit is not in use."
3,Unfortunate but true.,"It is easy to see what is going on with Mr. Jones' detractors. The new age sects he is describing in this book all have several things in common, not the least of which is the abrogation of having to aspire to any kind of standard. New age thinkers have decided that the only test of right and wrong is in your own mind. This, of course, makes a villian out of anyone who would try to hold you to a higher standard of ethics or behavior. They are truly the lazy man's religions."
2,The Gnostic Empire Strikes Back,"Peter Jones convincingly portrays feminist spirituality, homosexual rights, reverence for nature and the ecological movement, political correctness, eastern pantheistic religions, and the entire Age of Acquarius, as schemes of Satan. He warns the Orthodox Church that it is high time they arm themselves as "" Christian Soldiers"" to wipe out this Neo-Gnostic heresy. What the book serves to do, however, is to highlight many of the reasons intelligent individuals have taken issue with rigid Christian ideas."
2,wings,this has to marks worst album how could he get worse he totally does not do what ive come to expect from him he had 1 top 10 it wouldnt hurt to have wings and then he also had 2 top 25 hits which were trouble and wrong place at the wrong time so he just wasnt up to par
1,AN UNMITIGATED DISASTER!!,"This is possibly one of the worst recordings I have ever heard! Reba has no business doing ""cover"" songs that cannot be topped! And if she was going to do it the least she could have done was to pick good ones. HOnestly.....""On My Own"" .... flopped on the charts and even the DJS admitted it was a mistake for her to release this turkey of a song. Add ""You Keep Me Hangin On"" and ""You're NO Good"" to that list. The country songs aren't much better. SHe butchers most of them except for ""Starting Over"" which I think is better than Dolly's version. I still wouldn't have chosen to cover it, though. And she can never match Crystal Gayle on ""Talking in Your Sleep"" or Ray Price on ""I Won't Mention It Again"". ""Ring on Her Finger"" is adequate but too over-the-top!! This CD was given scathing reviews by the critics when it was first released....and with good reason. It was an unmitigated disaster!"
3,This one blew her hot streak,"One thing about this album, it's beautiful and easy to listen to, but it's just an album of remakes. Not only that, but most of the songs are literally karaoke of the original songs. One glaring exception, however, is her very nice remake of Dolly Parton's 1980 #1 Country hit and Donna Summer penned ""Starting Over Again"" (one of my favorites). Dolly's was great, but it sounds very dated by today's standards. Reba took hers to #19, but it still spent 20 weeks in the Country Top 100. As one of only two singles, the other a cover of Lee Greenwood's 1982 #5 Country Hit ""Ring On Her Finger, Time On Her Hands"" (hers went to #9). If you really love Reba, you'll love this album. If you're curious what Reba sounds like doing one of the old songs, don't buy it for anything but the above two. If neither applies, this CD is probably worth skipping."
2,NO MORE THAN TWO STARS,"I can't give this more than two stars. It is better than a lot of her 90s CDs which I only give one stars to. The CD is ruined by the inclusion of songs like ""You Keep Me Hangin On"", ""You're No Good"" and ""On My Own"" (one of the worst songs in the history of mankind made worse by Reba singing it with Trisha Yearwood, Martina McBride and Linda Davis). She could easily have left out ""By the Time I Get to Phoenix"" and ""Please Come to Boston"". She sounds like she's bored to death singing those. ""Talking in Your Sleep"" is o.k. but can hardly match the Crystal Gayle classic. ""Ring on Her Finger and Time on Her Hands"" is also all right. ""I Won't Mention It Again"" is excellent. Reba doesn't over do and the production is beautiful. The best cut on the CD is ""Starting Over"" which eclipses Dolly's version. Reba is excellent on this cover. For that I'll give this CD two stars!"
2,No remakes please,I think artists should stay away from doing songs from other artists. When an artists does remakes it never sounds like the original ones. Reba is no exception. She butchers these songs. The only good song on this CD is Starting Over Again. So Reba please do not do any more remakes of other artists songs.Stick to your own songs.
4,Modern logistics - an executive summary,"After reading various textbooks on logistics, quantitative analysis and strategy, this book was very refreshing, in large part from the fact that it is a short and non-technical book. The title of my review says it all, this book is summary for busy people wanting to get som insights into what is going on in logistics and organizational theory . I got through the book in two readings, which is a very valuable aspect for busy people.Still, despite being brief, it touches on most important aspects, and points you to further areas of importance if what you read here makes you want to change things in your organization.So: Not technical, easy read, 4 stars instead of 5 because it is too brief to be truly useful for those that actually want to learn the subject-matter."
3,Not my first choice....,"If you like me need to get to SCM strategic or tactical decisions, I would rather consult other books I also own. ""Strategic Logistics Management"" from a school book perspective and the brand new ""Designing and Managing the Supply Chain"" are excellent and better resources, covering everything (and then some) this book can offer. I will probably resell my copy of this book.For SAP ""Jockeys"" or those who are thinking about SAP, ""Supply Chain Management based on SAP Systems"" is Excellent."
5,MUST HAVE FOR VETERINARIANS,"SEVERAL YEARS AGO WE, AS A GROUP, BOUGHT THIS BOOK FOR OUR EMPLOYER, A VETERINARIAN. THE BOOK MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED. THIS YEAR I BOUGHT THIS UPDATED BOOK AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR THE VETERINARIAN. HE WAS VERY APPRECIATIVE AND EXCITED WHEN I GAVE HIM THIS BOOK. HE HAS TOLD ME REPEATEDLY THAT THIS BOOK HAS THE BEST PICTURES FOR ANY BREED HE LOOKS UP AND USES IT AS A REFERENCE TOOL WITH OUR CLIENTS. IT ALSO GIVES A WONDERFUL HISTORY FOR EACH BREED."
3,A little disappointed,The bracelet is nice considering the price. I was a little disappointed that the color wasn't as bright as in the picture. The pink is very pale.
5,Amazing music for an amazing story,"Horner composed the perfect score to set off this amazing movie. It pulls in just the right places, and the vocals are perfection. SO much better than Titanic (and I think the instrumentation for Titanic is gorgeous as well). And what else can you say about all the classic rock hits throughout this soundtrack. They make this the perfect soundtrack to own - a great mix of classic rock standards and haunting orchestrations."
4,Great educational game; but they can't count how many cards!,"My 5th grade son loves this game and enjoys competing in 24. My only gripe is that it is marketed as a deck of 96 cards, when in actuality you get 48 double-sided cards. It is misleading and the game is rather pricey for what you get. However, I still give it 4 stars because of the educational and fun values."
2,Bored to tears,"I was very surprised and upset as to how much I did not like this book.The writting style put me off, and the story lined dragged on and on.I found myself skipping pages to try and find the good parts.Not a very good read."
1,Dangerous to your Birds!!!,"Be careful with this one. My parakeet hung himself on a toy very similar to this. I had bought the toy at a pet store, assuming that meant they knew what was safe. My poor parakeet got the strings wrapped around her neck and probably panicked in her cage. It was very traumatic for me and my daughter to lose a pet that way. Follow my advice: If you have small birds never buy something wtih long strings hanging from it!!! (I only gave a star because I had to in order to submit the review.)"
5,High Quality Toy,"I bought this for my 5 year old train enthusiast for Christmas. I was very surprised at how heavy the wood was--not flimsy at all. Great value for the money spent. It works well with all Thomas the Tank Engine and generic wooden train sets. The paint is colorful and shiny making this a really special buy that offers kids fun, imaginative play."
3,A Chakotay episode,"In a Chakotay filled 45 minutes we learn that the second in command has been kidnapped by an alien scientist who wants to use Chakotay to prove his theory about the origin of his species. You see this alien is a member of a very proud race that believe it is the first being to be created on their planet and that they are the most important creation in the Universe. But this maverick scientist believes that their race, the Voth, originated on Earth and that the human's onboard Voyager are his distant ancestors... well apparently he was once a dinosaur so they must be VERY distant ancestors.This is a strange episode that explores the religion vs. science war and that it is often best to lie to people then give them groundbreaking news that they can't handle."
5,This book is great.,I was in 7th grade math one and with this book and the rest of the series I was taking AP calculus BC the next year.
2,"Good Problems, Bad Textbook","Analytical Mechanics by Hand and Finch is more like Analytical S*#! Sandwich by two awful textbook writers. I didn't mind the fact that there were so few examples throughout the text, or the lack of answers to problems in the back. I think that actually encourages creative thinking and builds problem solving skills, provided the rest of the book is written clearly enough to help students build a strong concept base. This book however, is not clearly written and ends up either frustrating the students or boring them to tears, or both... usually both.I would suggest picking up a book with a little bit of personality, and possibly using this one for the challenging problems, once you feel confident with the material."
3,Good Quality Sweatshirt,"I purchased 3 sweatshirts from three different vendors through Amazon. All three are of good quality, fit well, and were reasonably of good quality. In all cases, they were received before the estimated date."
5,A Non Mystery Fan Finds An Intriguing Mystery,"Falling Down is a mystery that will cause you to read the entire book in one seating. It is spellbinding and guaranteed to raise the hairs on the back of your neck. Not one to widely read mysteries, I found that this one not only held my attention but made me want more."
4,Detroit urban--African American perspective---suspense,"Gary Hardwick does an excellent portrayal of Detroit from the perspective of black white collar professional versus the street African-American neighborhood which is caught up in drugs, viloence, and guns. Jesse King, an assistant DA, is caught in conflict between his successful career as a black ADA and his old neighborhood as typified by his older sister Bernice who is constantly in and out of drug rehab. Of perhaps the last 100 books that I have read, this book would be among the top 25. Recommended reading."
4,Only Hardwick could have told this tale!,"Like his other novels, Hardwick weaves a tale like no other. This novel is filled with deceptions, betrayals, and good old fashion mysteries. I enjoyed it and I think you will too. It is especially interesting if you have ever been to Detroit and enjoy learning about the inner workings of politics and government."
5,Buddy Holly was the best ever.,I wish Buddy was still alive.The people who sing Buddy's song's sound good.I recommend this to anyone who hasn't heard it.
2,Not that great,"This book is for beginning to intermediate users of Photoshop, so graphics professionals, or anyone who relies on Photoshop to do their job, should beware. The ""tricks"" aren't that special, and the text is ponderous in the author's attempt at wry humour."
4,"For a graphic designer, not a photographer","This is an excellent book for an advertiser or graphic designer. There are TONS of text effects and tricks that would be vital to creating ad copy or web graphics. As a photographer, I found very little that was relevant to my line of work. So it's a great book for a lot of people, just not for photographers."
4,not bad,"I'm a law student, and I wanted a small, nonbreakable mirror to put in my locker. It's not as good as a glass mirror, but then again, you don't have to worry about shattered glass if you slam your locker too hard. This is very good for what it is. It stays put on the locker and lets me check my hair and makeup between classes."
4,It's pretty good,"I have been taking acustic guitar lessons for 6 years now. I decided to buy this to try and learn to play the electric guitar I recieved as a gift. It's a pretty good method. Sometimes a bit difficult to work with, but you do learn some things. I stopped using it because it became increasingly difficult to play when I realized that I had a bass amp. So make sure you have all the right equipment, and I would have to say that this might be easier for someone who's taken guitar lessons."
5,great!,"everything was fantastic! it arrived early, looks exactly the same as the photo, no fake advertising, and the rope-chain-thing is great too, it extends, but if you want to give one half to another person, you have to cut the rope and buy two whole new chains. all in all, I'm VERY happy"
3,Not as helpful as I had hoped!,"I have read a lot of books by Dr. Sears, and was excited to hear of this one, since we may be facing this diagnosis with our 6 year old. In many ways, the book was very helpful, and I particularly like the alternatives to drug therapy advice. However, I would like to have seen some more documentation for some of the strategies. Neurofeedback sounds promising, but it might also be hocus-pocus! I am also not sure of the reliance on ""behavior mod"" and reward systems -- anybody with a kid like this has ""been there, done that."" All in all, this is a good book for helping you focus on what is RIGHT with your ADD kid and for showing you how to function better as a family, but it isn't a definitive work complete with references."
1,Extended Battery & Door,"The battery and door did not fit my RAZR V3, even though the picture shown was a V3, not a V3C. I returned it for a full refund."
3,OK,"I bought this type of Tweezer from a beauty supply and I loved them. Eventually they wore out, so I ordered another from the supplier on Amazon. The tweezer is not as good as the first. They are the same in every respect except they are not as strong as the first pair. I feel that they have less metal, therefore they won't last as long. Next time I will go to the beauty supplier and get another brand."
4,Tony Bennett--truly an American Classic,"I've seen this fabulous birthday tribute to Tony Bennett, twice, once on my HDTV and again as a rental in Blu-ray--and it's fabulous. If you're never able to see Tony live which I painfully regret to admit, this Blu-ray release will really put you there in all its high definition. The only reason I knocked off a star is because of the shortness of the program but director Rob Marshall (Chicago, Memoirs of a Geisha) has done a superb job of bringing off this tribute to Bennett in grand fashion. Bennett once said to Ray Charles that he didn't have a really great voice but the late Charles said, ""But baby, you sing with so much feeling"" And that's where it counts!!"
3,Entertaining but chaotic avant-garde poetry,"There are some interesting prose poems, wacky skewed narratives with surrealist wit.When I read the rest of the poems, I found them frustratingly incomprehensible, even compared to other contemporary poetry. I did, however, enjoy discussing them with friends, reading them aloud and trying to come up with even a hint of what they might be trying to do."
5,A totally innovative roleplaying system,"This system is a must for roleplayers who have either become jaded with their existing system or just want to try something new. It provides a comprehensive story-line and time-line and gives the characters a whole new lease on development. The lay-out the book is easily read-able and engaging and provides the reader with an understanding of just how much is left to the players and Marshal. When I bought this book, I just had to show it to my roleplayign buddies, and they now are totally hook as I am sure you will be. If you wish to know more contact me or the Deadlands list serve. Marshal Psycho."
5,Waiting for more...,"My review will be short and sweet. I was surprised to find out that this was a first novel. I loved it from the first page. I am a big fan of recurring characters and cannot wait to see the sequel. I loved the characters, the setting and the story. What a whacked bunch of people--I loved every one of them. Especially Ann."
1,Broken Item,"Unfortunately the product bought was broken, and the instructions to return it were not clear. This purchase was supposed to be a Christmas present. We will not buy again from this person again."
5,Young and Old,Great show for the kids and the older kids. Enjoyed the story and identified with the elder in the show. Lots of great lessons easily received in an animated form.
5,Amazing Movie,"Much more than a kids movie this movie is a heartbreaking yet heartwarming story about loss. It takes you on one mans journey through love, loss and moving on. Truly touching. Still enjoyable for the whole family, just small kids won't understand everything the movie actually says."
2,"Great Art and Execution, But Sad Drama.","It is a great implementation of art and graphics, and the story moves along smoothly. Unfortunately, this success is bounded by a sad drama that is unnecessary to the story, and darkens the mood. It would have been a great movie without the darkness."
3,Good kids movie,"Kinda of boring if you want a movie with a realistic plot. It had some comical points, but is better suited for kids."
4,up and away,"The scenary of the angel fall and the plato that surroud the fall is awesome, seems almost real!!!!"
2,missing disc/won't play,I bought this item and when it arrived it was missing one of 4 discs. In addition the blue ray would not play in 2 of my 3 players. Not happy
4,Good Movie,"I enjoyed the movie, it was very cute. Even for grown up kids. I would recommend it for someone wanting to smile a little."
3,Good movie for older children,"The movie was pretty good. It was funny and very adventurous, but it was also sad (in some parts), yet endearing. As a parent of four, I felt like the movie was geared more toward older children. I think younger children would be a little bored and wouldn't get most of the humor. The movie looked great on Bluray (which is why I bought it), the characters looked almost real!"
1,NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES! No Closed Captioning!,"Contrary to what we've been given to expect from Disney, there is no closed captioning and there are no English subtitles for this movie.Waste of time."
5,FIVE *****,"This movie is an excellent movie, for small children and adults. We purchased this for my son as an infant and now two years later, he still loves watching it!"
4,Squirrel!,"Perfect entertainment for young and old to watch together.My grandson watched and I laughed the whole way through.I still smile hear someone say ""Squirrel!"""
5,Fantastic,"This is my daughter's favorite movie hands down. I'm a big fan too.For the $, this set includes a digital copy and the DVD and Blu-Ray versions. Great value, great movie, child and adult friendly. You can't go wrong with this. Well worth the price."
5,Classic,"One of the best moves I've seen all year. The opening sequence, with the main character growing up and growing old, is one of the most touching scenes I've ever seen in a movie. But the whole movie is a gem -- so much whimsy in one little classic."
2,waste of money,this is one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time. the story sucks. An old man pulling on a house trying to save a bird with the help of a fat kid and a dog with a collar that talks. do not waste your money.Not even my 2 and 5 year old like it.
2,Up or Down?,"Really torn on the movie.I loved the beginning, but found myself wondering right away, ""Just how is this a kid's movie?"" The plot was just too grown-up. Then they started haphazardly throwing in this random stuff obviously meant to amuse young children. It was uncomfortable.Don't get me wrong. The introduction was engrossing. The animation was great. Most of the characters were genuinely lovable, especially the old man and Kevin. But in the end, it just felt like an ugly patchwork - bits and pieces were extraordinary, but ultimately, everything clashed.For the record, I have no problem with talking animals or nonsense in a children's movie - I even expect them. And I truly love Pixar. But this film just didn't sit right with me. The idea was very adult-minded, and it didn't seem like Disney quite worked out what message they wanted to send to kids. Very confusing.Although I really enjoyed some parts, Up left me feeling down.."
5,Excellent BD. Good buy.,Great story. And to see such vivid colors in blu-ray. I highly recommend it.
3,Not entirely a kids' movie...,"Whoever feels that this is a children's movie is mistaken. Subjects in the movie, like a husband and wife losing their baby during a pregnancy and the wife later dying, are far from what I would call kids' movie material. My 11 year old is still crying. Sorry I got it."
5,Amazing movie,This is one of the best Pixar films made and that's saying a lot coming the year after Wall-E. The 4-disc blu-ray brings tons of features and having a DVD and electronic version are handy when you don't have a Blu-Ray player around.
5,This movie gets me to think about my own life,"The first 10 minutes gets me to reflect the years that have passed by me. I'm not old, but today I think more about practical life than pursuing dreams. However, when I watch this movie, I couldn't help remembering those dreams, plans, and efforts that I once had or paid. Most of those are no longer with me. This movie gets them back. A movie that instills reflections of life into a person's mind is the best movie in my book."
1,Just Getting the Movie to Start is a WAR,"""Up"" is a great movie, I highly recommend it, but wait for a better DVD Treatment.Allow lots and lots and lots of time to get the movie started.The DVD doesn't even play on some players, thanks to some DRM (Digital Restriction Mess-Up).UOPs (User Operation Prohibition) are enabled on this DVD meaning that you cannot skip over many parts of the DVD and are FORCED to watch things you have no interest in.While it is easy to purchse a DVD player that overrides UOPs, there are no Blu-ray players that do this YET.Avoid this presentation of the movie. When a later one is released that is not hostile to the viewer, buy it only then."
4,"Good movie, but damaged dvd sleeve","Love the movie, but the sleeve the DVD came in was scratched in multiple places (the color came off, and now are just white splotches). It's a shame, as it ruins a nice cover, and it's probably not worth paying the shipping to get a replacement."
5,Great Movie!,"This movie is one of my all-time favorites! The dvd arrived in great condition and on time. If you get a chance to buy this, by all means, do it."
1,"No CC, subtitles OR Dvd Menu!",I am really really disappointed with Disney for not including Closed Captioning or Subtitles for this movies. How are the deaf and hard of hearing supposed to watch this!? They also didn't bother to have a dvd menu. Why? Are they that cheap and not support the Deaf and Hard of Hearing!?
1,Digital copy in question,"Couldn't get the ""Digital Copy"" to work on the Mac. Maybe a hacker could download the necessary additional software but I'm not. Recommend getting the regular one disc version which I've done."
3,"Overrated, a good, but not great movie","Up is a considerably overated movie, it certainly does not deserve any best picture awards or any such thing. I can see it winning for technical animation for the graphics though. The dogs are a lot of fun, the story at the beginning is interesting, though the overall story in general is pretty shallow. I would say that the first 3/4 of the movie is very good. They do seem to make a considerable mistake in the latter part of the film in trying to turn it into a action film. There are better animated films out there (ie: Toy Story, Meet the Robinsons, The Incredibles, Bolt etc), but Up is an enjoyable enough film, it's just not an all-time great movie or anything, it's a little above average."
5,"it cant get any better. i say that every time, and pixar proves me wrong","let me just start by saying i love almost every pixar movie(except cars). when i heard this was coming out i had to see it, and i rarely go to the theaters. im glad i did and in 3d. i smiled, laughed, almost wept some tears for the old man. now that i got this on blu ray ive watched it twice and it showed up on my door yesterday! this is an awesome movie and if you dont like it..... i dont think we can be friends. thanks russel and mr. fredericksenoh kevin and dug too."
3,Not bad...,"No one warns you about the beginning of the movie... So SAD!! That is not how I normally want a movie to start out. Once past this, it starts to get better. All in all, Cars is still number one for me for Pixar movies."
4,Up is a great film,"A very outstanding film featuring an unlikely hero who is old and offers us many lessons about love, life, loss and heroes having clay feet. Some of the best movies in the film industry are being made by Pixar. In my opinion the first fifteen minutes of his life were fantastic and actually brought a lump to my throat such was the power of this animated movie. Some of the scenes other than the first fifteen minutes stay with you, such as the house's final resting place after the balloons have snapped- simply superb. Ed Asner who simply is Carl Fredricksen, Jordan Nagai as Russell and Christopher Plummer nailing the role of Charles Muntz.Four stars 6/18/10"
5,"Up, up and away.........","I had seen the movie, UP, at a theater and wanted my daughter and her husband to see it so I ordered it from Amazon and had it shipped to them. The online ordering was extremely easy and it was shipped promptly and arrived in perfect shape.The movie is funny and touching and after seeing it the first time with a friend, I saw it again with my grandchildren. It is a classic which will touch your heart while it tickles your funnybone."
1,Bad.,"No where in the discription did it say it was a bootleg. It doesnt have a menu, special features or anything. I was VERY upset. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PERSON!!!!!!!!!"
2,Not for little kids,"This is a wonderful movie with a beautiful story, but it is not a movie for really little kids. Our 2 year old son was in tears for much of the movie, upset with what was happening, and I am pretty sure not understanding the underlying story. Some of the violence was a bit too much, with the villian shooting at the kid at one point. Again, I thought it was a good movie, but not for the same audience as Finding Nemo or Monsters Inc."
4,"Great Film, BUT No 3D ?, So no sale until it's released with 3D","I can't beleve it, disney has done it again, no 3D version on this Blu-ray, WHY, if it's been made in 3D then allow us to view it in 3D when we buy the Blu-ray, I think it may be another sales marketing ploy by disney to get us all to purchase the film in 2D and then later bring it out in 3D so that we all have to buy it again, Disney are the masters of getting money out of us, it's happening with Lord of the Rings, only released on Blu-Ray in the theatrical versions, when they know it's the special extended versions that people want, but again we poor idiots have to buy the collection twice."
5,Super cute story & movie!,"I didn't get a chance to see this in the theatre, and I rarely purchase movies have not not seen, but on the recommendation of my mother, I did buy this set. And I am so glad I did. The movie is heartwarming & sweet, yet very funny & has action! My boys that are 6, 5 & 2 just love it! And I loved the story too! I'm super picky on what my kids watch & what movies I buy for them to see over & over again (like kids like to do), and this one is not crude, or mean, or scary, or inappropriate in any way. There is no cursing, no questionable language or content. It deals with love, loss, friendship & mentor ship. Plus it's nice to have the blu-ray to play at home & the dvd copy to keep in the vehicle for road trips. It's a movie I can stand to either watch or listen to over & over again!"
4,Sony ICF-36 Portable TV-Radio,"For the money it is a great radio. The batteries last forever it seems. And I play it a lot. The radio was a little larger than I had expected or hoped in size. However overall performance and quality of sound is very good for the radio. The TV is better than most radios of this type, except in the lower band numbers such as channel 2 or 4. You can eventually get it in, but you might have to play with it al little. Late evening is better for this problem. Of course this minor problem could be just for my area. Lets put it this way, if something happened to it, such as it got lost or fell and broke, I would most certainly replace it with the same exact item."
3,Does the trick for AM,"Not the best sound quality but works well for AM, which is what i use it for. When using headphones you may only get sound in one ear. I have two of these radios and both have the problem. I have tried different headphones and have the same problem."
5,Sony ICF-36 Radio,The radio has very good sound for its size and receives a signal from a reasonable distance. This radio is a very good value for the money.
4,Paperport Pro 11,"I've been using paperport for years and can't live without this software. I like the changes that were made. However, it seems that this version is alot slower that my previous version. It may have something to do with installing the indexer, which I subsequently uninstalled. But, it's still slow.The best thing about the package is that you can setup the scan settings. This is much better than how the software previously worked.I would still buy it again."
5,Rex deus,"This was a great book, I just might retread it before I pass it along to a friend to enjoy."
1,Pen Doesn't work,"Would love to try the two sets of Hot Dots we now own, but the pen does not work. I'd return it and order another one, but the previous reviews make it seem doubtful it's worth it. Too bad because it seems like a good concept. Now I have these useless cards and a pen that doesn't work."
1,annoying,This is so annoying. This is the third pen I have gotten and none of them work!!! I can't believe I spent money on these things!! The pen worked for the first day or so. I will never buy this again! I am going to complain to educational insights as well. Ridiculous!
1,Not what I was expecting,"This book was recommeded by William Maughan in his book The Artist's Complete Guide to Drawing the Head. I thought Maughan's book was great and was hoping this would be more of the same. Unfortunately not. Essentially all this book is is a written discripion of various parts of the body, written in very arcane language, with a few pencil sketches of body parts. The descriptions of the body parts do not even refer to the sketches. Definately not for beginners and experienced artists should not waste their time trying to parse the erudite language of this book."
4,Sister Circle #1,"I enjoyed the book but I was a little surprised with all the quotes from the Bible. I was not familiar with this author. I will probably read the next Sister Circle book because of the characters in the book, I enjoyed them. Amazon was very prompt in delievering my order."
1,Disappointed,"Just would like to know, WHERE IS THE BOOK. all I got was like a study guide. Very disappointed. I know it was free, but I thought I got a book to read. Any idea how to fix this?"
2,Not a good fit,Husband got for work but he has very wide feet and these were too narrow. Seemed like good quality but fit is more important when walking around all day.
5,Great CD,"Cant stop listening to it. My fave tracks are Can We Flo, Time & Place and Good Luv. Buy this cd. You will love it!"
3,JODECI-so freeky!,"This album was cool. It was not as cold as DIARY OF A MAD BAND, because it did not display their total vocal talent. Yet and still I have my favorites: Pump It Back, Good Luv, Freek N You and others. JODECI is a good band, overall. I love them!"
3,DIARY OF A MAD BAND IS THEIR BEST EVER!,"Yall act as if this is the best Jodeci CD ever. DIARY OF A MAD BAND is their best and most creative CD ever! This CD has too many post-Death Row Records and The Chronic influences that It's not even funny and I can't even listen to every song. The best songs on this CD are ""Freek N You,"" ""Get on Up,"" ""Fun 2 Nite,"" ""S-more,"" and ""Love U 4 Life,"" but I don't like to listen to this CD cuzz it reminds me of their early disbandment and the ""Get on Up"" video without DeVante Swing's participation. THIS CD IS ALL RIGHT, BUT ""DIARY OF A MAD BAND"" IS THEIR BEST EVER, CREATIVELY, MELODICALLY, VOCALLY, LYRICALLY, TOPICALLY, MUSICALLY, IMAGEWISE, ETC. C+"
2,Just ok. Politically correct.,"The newest edition is the best detailed Italian-English dictionary that I am familiar with (430,000 entries).But the dictionary is not perfect. For one thing, it shows the typical Collins political-correctness bias. E.g., it lists ""male chauvinist pig"" (which it translates as ""dirty macho""), and it accepts this highly offensive term as standard, if informal, English. (The proper label for this term is ""offensive"" or ""rude"").Doesn't this bias irritate and offend anybody else? I am mad as hell."
3,"Well-made, but not very instructive","Jacobs is a good writer and the examples in the book are interesting. However, the book fails in its goal, assuming that goal is to instruct you how to analyse. Like many mediocre books, this one states its conclusions without showing how it got there. For instance, Jacobs will show you how a player picked the wrong move, but if he had analysed more, he would have found the right move, x. He does not, however, explain why x is a better move, except to show that it would have won, etc. Not recommended."
1,It's not the Original Soundtrack,"I was delighted to find the soundtrack to this great movie at Amazon.com because I couldn't find it in any record store. Unfortunately, it's ""music from and inspired by"" the film, always a bad sign. It's missing EIGHT songs from the original soundtrack CD (which my friend has) and most importantly, does not include the Joan Armatrading version of ""Me, Myself, I"". The info on the Amazon.com page doesn't explain this. Be warned!"
4,"Good, but hard to find","Don't get me wrong, this is a great CD. However, it is out of print and is hard to find sometimes. many of the same songs are on first rays of the new rising sun, which is much easier to find. If you're a die-hard fan like I am, go ahead and buy it- it's great hearing how two different engineers made the final products, but you have to know your hendrix inside and out to tell the difference. I'm glad I bought it, but if you're not obsessed like I am, you're going to end up thinking you wasted your money."
5,UN EXITO TODO EL CD,"Otra vez calificando la música de este gran cantaautor argentino, radicado en mexico y usa. Este cd es un poco dificil de encontrar pero navegando en la red se encuentra en algunos sitio on line de usa y europa. Si mal no recuerdo el lp original es como del 84. realmente impactó este trabajo al punto de tener varias versiones en salsa pero nunca de la calidad del trabajo original. Las 9 canciones son muy buenas, excelentes:1-NADIE MEJOR QUE TU, 2-AMOR TAN MIO, 3-TODO EMPEZÓ, 4-AMOR DE CADA DIA,5-POR HABERTE AMADO TANTO,6- TU ME QUEMAS,7- AMAR A MUERTE, 8-PENSANDO TODO EL DIA EN TÍ, 9-DICEN QUE DICEN/UN AMOR COMO EL MÍO.Puede ser un poco dificil buscar música de Luis Angel en cd dado que nunca se imprimió sus trabajos a gran escala, creo que por los problemas que ha tenido luis angel con las casas discográficas porque calidad y exitos tiene de sobra en toda latinoamerica y usa. Vale la pena tratar de obtener este cd, con gran calidad de sonido."
1,totally unprofessional edition,"As advertised, this is a professional edition. But in fact, if you plan to put around 150 images at 2 or 2.5 MB file size each, along with background music into an album, you will be very, very dissappointed , because either background music will be playing erratically or the Autoflip function wouldn't work smoothly. So you have to disable background music or flip manually! I called Tech.support and they admitted it, the software couldn't not handle image files that large!!( 2-2.5MB each) when autoflip with background music. Anyway, it's too late, the store where you bought it doesn't accept opened software to be returned. ... Based on the User's guide, the limitation of photos in one album is 200, but image file size has never been mentioned!!"
3,best used in conjunction with course and CASE tools,"this book is an insightful, thorough and straightforward examination of the art and practise of information system design. however, it's difficult to really incorporate its lessons unless you are using it in conjunction with a course and using the powerful CASE (Computer Aided Software Engineering) tools featured therein. the author himself is perhaps the premier teacher in the country on this subject and if you're really interested in software design and you are in new york by all means make every attempt to attend his class at columbia university. if not, then i guess this text by itself might be the next best thing. in any event, this book will serve as a useful guide to both the student and seasoned software design professional."
2,Don't buy it,This printer EATS ink - especially since I seem to have to clean the heads every time I use it. It also feeds the paper crooked to the pictures aren't square with the edges. I won't buy another Epson printer.
1,an all around bad buy,"I have to say that this printer has been a pain ever since I bought it. It prints unclear letters, makes gaps in the black ink and acts like it is out of color when it really isn't . I think that this product must be manufactured with a defect. Also, sometimes it bleeds large quantities of black paint when it prints and it gets all over everything. This is a real waste of money. Even if you put in brand new ink cartridges it still prints horribly and its picture printing quality is just as bad."
2,Bad impression,"I bought this one to for it's speed. I returned it the next day. (Not bought through Amazon) The printer is terribly noisy feeding paper. Too many loud clunks when feeding, especially compared to my old printer.The printer was leaving streaks on the prints on some of the first prints. I didn't use it enough to see if that cleared up. It has a permanent print head instead of the print head being built into the cartridge, so I didn't like seeing streaks like a clogged head when it was all new.I'd rather stick with my pokey HP 712C than listen to this faster one."
1,I would give Epson -5 stars for it,"Worst printer. I read it in some magazines how good it is, fast, quiet, superbo photo printing quality, ink saving comparing to other printers. Either those editors had been paid by Epson or they were simply blind. Yes, it is fast, but it's ugly, wrong color on photo printing, noisy, and it use more ink for cleaning itself than for printing. It's ok to have some lousy products once for a while, but it's bad to sell it by simply telling lies about it. I am about to chop it apart and stay away from Epson forever."
4,Great Investment,"This printer is co cool! At first I was hesitant to buy it since saw some reviews that said that there was some kind of line on the prints, but I said I'll just give it a try, and I did. I could not be any happier. The prints are outstanding! When I use the PHOTO paper with the best resolution my prints look just like regular pictures (actually better). So if you're looking for a printer that is affordable and great print quality then you found it!"
1,The thief of Bahgdad,"How the thousands of buyers of the Epson C80 have not risen up as a group to protest the ""duping of America"" is a tribute to Epson's ability to control the opinions of the buying public. Few products pursue the ""screw the public"" attitude with such alacrity.Today, my printer went South after it informed me that""certain parts have reached the end of their useful life"". I haven't printed 2500 pages in the last 2 years.I wouldn't buy an Epson printer ever again. I would urge all who read this to make their friends aware of the travesty that is the Epson C80, and warn them against dealing with this company.Herbert Zimmerman"
1,a piece of crap,"In the year 2012, only the most dysfunctional company imaginable would put a can opener on the market that one has to struggle with to use. I would also give 0 stars if that was an option. People were making successful electric can openers at least a half century ago. There is really no excuse for this product."
1,Piece of... trash.,"Too bad, I threw the money with this purchase, it makes no difference to the built-in microphone, in any case (with or without battery assist system), plus you realize that it is very expensive when you have it in your hands because it looks like and possibly performance as the ""Sima MZM-1 Camcorder Mini Zoom Microphone"" but it costs nearly 4 times the price. I trusted because the SONY brand but they fail me.Sima MZM-1 Mini Zoom Camcorder MicrophoneMalisimo, boté el dinero con esta compra, no hay diferencia con el micrófono incorporado, en ningún caso (con o sin el sistema de la batería), ademas te das cuenta de que es muy costoso cuando lo tienes en las manos. Se parece mucho y posiblemente se desempeña como el ""Sima MZM-1 Mini Zoom Camcorder Microphone"" pero cuesta casi 4 veces su precio. Me confié por la marca y me quedaron mal.Sima MZM-1 Mini Zoom Camcorder Microphone"
1,"Very, very disappointed.","I did not like this book at all. I found it very limited. Information was geared mostly to figurines, bottles, dolls, vases, cup and saucers, toys, etc.There was a lot of information on furniture but very, very few pictures.Very little information on 'country' type antiques, which is what I was looking for."
1,Not a favorite,"This author was recommended by a friend, who found him charming and funny. Unfortunately, I find him neither. I rather find him to write poorly, and his humor is, to me, vulgar and juvenile. I will not buy another of his books."
3,picture book that is NOT for kids,Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Picture book that is so disturbing I wouldn't want my kids to read it.
3,Basic Dictionary,I have just started to learn french and I found this to be a useful dictionary. It helps me to get through my classes. My only problem was that on two occassions I was unable to find a few words in it.
3,High School French Class,"I bought this for my daughter that's in High School French II. She says that the definitions in this dictionary aren't what is in her French book, the meaning is correct it's just not the same meaning as what she would need. This is what she tried to explain to me. So therefore, she barely uses it. It may be a great dictionary for a higher level French class or maybe another use."
2,Agonizing for first-time users . . .,"I have been pulling my hair out for the past several days, after installing this program. My husbank and I are first-time home studio/computer recording and song writing, after many years of using acutal mixing boards. This program has been REALLY difficult to figure out. There's no tech help in the U.S.(you have to call an international number ), and the manual reads like ""Greek"". The aggrivation of trying to trouble shoot has cut drastically into our creativity. This has NOT been fun!"
4,Selling advice for accounts of every size,"Every decision maker is surrounded by a wall of voicemail, email, and gatekeepers. Not only has technology made decision makers tougher to reach, but downsizing has heaped more work on top of management, so they have very little time to consider new products and services. This book provides strategies for the salesperson trying to crack a new account,and it helps you refocus your sales process to get through to time-starved execs. Furthermore, the sample emails, letters, and voicemail messages help you revise your value statement in a perspective that decision makers want to hear."
5,This book transformed the way I approach selling!,"As CEO of a start-up, I am responsible for helping with Sales. Having no experience in this area made this a daunting task. Then I read Jill's book and, for the first time, feel like I have a clue and a plan. This book really resonated with my personal and corporate values and I am excited about implementing her ideas. I bought an extra copy of this book to give to our Head of Sales so she and I can be on the same page when approaching clients. This book is a MUST READ for anyone who plays any role in the sales process for their organization."
4,Great Ideas!!,I found the book to be very helpful in identifying the challenges faced in selling into a more complex environment. The ideas for overcoming the challenges were good. I think this is an excellent book to use as a guide for sales people to think about why they might not being seeing the level of success available to them. Key thought is to stop thinking in terms of your own product and think more about the value of your product/service/solution from the customer's side of the desk.
1,"Not at useful as one might think,",I purchased this book to add to my collection and found that it contained less information than one might find in a basic stagecraft book found at any college bookstore. It is my opinion that some of the staging ideas though sound if done properly could be hazardous otherwise. I suggest that if you are not experienced in stagecraft to purchase this book along with a companion stagecraft book and pull from both sources to design and build your show. There are some good suggestions for easy to move lightweight pageant grade sets and this source should not be overlooked. I simply sugest that you not use this as your only reference. To the experienced builder - skip this text all together the designs in the book are old and you most likely will kick your self and say I know how to put plywood platforms on sawhorses why did I buy this!.
5,A Practical Guide to Portable Stage Sets,"This guide included some very helpful material - I stage direct for a small college w/ a small budget and this book was extremely useful. I especially enjoyed the the set design for The Barber of Seville. From prompting ideas for small yet effective and efficient set designs to actual detailed structural integrity guidance, this book is a treasure for any performing arts organization. --Glay Marie Posch, Hou., TX"
5,Will make you into a man,"Looking to get so swool? If you answered yes, then you probably aren't doing the most manly of exercises made even more manly by adding weight. If that is the case, buy this belt and look at it while you are doing manly lifts that you could only dream of doing with extra weight. When you have re-acquired you man card and can do these exercise with ease, you may finally bust out the belt.At this time you will notice this belt is a top quality piece, which is what manly men want in their products. The chain is long, because the people at Grizzly Fitness understand that manly men have large pieces of manhood and therefore need to have our weights hang considerably lower than our crotches.CLIFFS:You're not huge. You need to be huge. You need this belt to do so. Stop doing cable curls in an undersized wife-beater in front of a large mirror and order this belt, brah."
3,"SLOPPY, SLOPPY, SLOPPY!","First of all, in general this is a good book. As has been said before, there are no really good Flash books out there that cater to the advanced user. Some of the tutorials are great. However, this book is riddled with typos, the CD-ROM is full of errors. There is code that doesn't work on all platforms. Shouldn't a book teaching Flash teach how to write proper cross-platform code? The error-checking on this book is abysmal. Maybe that's a plus, I learned how to debug Flash programs really well. However, to the average reader this kind of thing can be very frustrating."
1,Not worth the money,"I agree with one of the other customers who said this was not atutorial book, just cut and paste stuff. I am an intermediate userand I found this book to be worthless to me. I think maybe only ONE of the examples they use is something I would ever use for the web. So if anyone want's a cheap copy, call me...."
2,No help for anyone who wants to learn basics,"I bought this book in anticipation that it would build up from the fundamentals into the more complex like most books would do. I figured that this book would be a thick bible-like one like the Director 7 book that I bought. The first chapter begins with how to make a preloader screen. I suppose the author assumes that you know how to do everything that would come after the preloader screen. I am new to Flash, that is why I bought the book in the first place. I am pretty disappointed that it provides no help for someone who is new to flash. The reason most people would buy a book is to learn about the program. Those who already know how to do most of the options and are pretty familiar with how the program runs will probably have fun with this book. For that reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, but I feel that maybe they could have spent the extra time to fatten the book up a bit."
2,Don't expect to understand exactly what you're doing,"This is a pretty good book that does a better job of showing you what Flash 4 is capable of than actually explaining the nuts and bolts of designing/action-scripting with Flash. It was my first book on Flash (big mistake) and discouraged me for a few months. Besides the Flash manual, I had to consult the Flash 4 quickstart guide to figure out what these guys were doing. This book definitely needs to go into more detail with actionscripts. I'm not at all certain that I would buy it again if given the choice. A lot of these techniques (and more advanced ones) are available for free online. The e-commerce shopping cart didn't really excite me like it did everyone else. They don't describe how to read data in or send it out, which makes the tutorial more of a gimmick than an actual tool. Bells and whistles are great for giggles, but I'm not sure if the giggles were worth the dent in my pocketbook."
4,Excellent Stuff,"The book is definitely worth every penny spent. The bundled CD-ROM itself is full of goodies.I found the tutorials and examples fascinating and helpful. Although quite new to Flash, it has given me lots to think about in the integration of Flash in websites as well as standalone Flash applications.I would say that the book is more recommended for intermediate and advance level Flash users as it does not touch on the basics too much. Better off purchasing a Flash reference to get u going first.I say go get the book anyways! Brilliant!"
3,Tutorials not very clear,"I have a very basic background in Flash but there are many aspects to this book that make it difficult to follow. Several times it omits information in its example, such as labelling a script or instance. Terseness is not a virtue in a step by step tutorial. For action scripts you are just given the script and you have to figure out how to entered it. If you have a good flash background, I guess this is no big deal, but if not you will be lost and your final product will not work. After alot of backtracking through the examples I worked on and referring to other books, I managed to get through the tutorials, and I guess did learn the hard way. Nonetheless, more detailed explanations would have been very helpful and alot less frustrating. I looked forward to this book when I bought it, but it just does not explain how to use action scripts at all, even though this is the heart of the lessons. If you want to learn flash programming, look elsewhere."
4,I like it,"Nice watch for the price. No issues yet I will say don't buy it from fossil direct, they have bad customer service, watch grabber was much better"
4,Lots of fun,My son liked this ball a lot. It has been very helpful to teach him how to throw and catch a football. We are having lots of fun and it is very durable.
5,A great introduction to Dante,"A fun and useful guide for a casual or undergrad student reader of Dante. Only skimpy coverage of each canto of the Inferno, but an extremely helpful guide nonetheless"
3,Warning! Not a kit,"This is not a kit. Only the control box. No coils, no plug wires, no spark plug mounts. Have not installed yet so not sure how it works. Still trying to find all the parts."
1,sucks,"weighted down my hair, didnt really get the soft touch i was expecting.over all shitty productfeels like your straightening your hair with conditioner"
5,Wonderful toy!,"This really is a great toy for you toddler. We purchased this for my 2 year old yesterday, and she has been playing with it practically nonstop. I am not sure why the price for this is so high on amazon? We purchased ours at Toys R Us for only $42. There are so many different cartridges, and different screens on each cartridge, so many places for the child to touch. The music is sure to catch your child's attention! My only negative comment is that the volume seems to be SO loud. There is a high and low volume switch on the back, but it still seems to be quite loud for us. With that said...the good things about this toy greatly outweigh the loud volume."
4,A GOOD SEQUEL,I enjoyed this book ...it is inspiring and a happy story about a woman who overcame great obstacles against all odds in Hollywood!! Bravo!!!
2,A Harry Kim episode... uh-oh!,"Whilst having a little chat with a local race, the Nasari, Harry Kim warns Janeway that the Nasari are about to attack. Bearing in mind that the Nasari are a peaceful race Janeway is a bit shocked when Kim is blasting their ship with phasers and photon torpeodes, a battle begins, with both ships ending up limping away from each other badly damaged. Harry gets sent to quarters for disobeying direct orders and causing an act of agression toward a friendly race.It is only later that Tuvok reveals scans indicate the Nasari were about to fire - how did Kim know! Suddenly Kim starts getting strange feelings and markings on his body. He asks that they go to a neighbouring planet, once there Kim is welcomed ""home""!This is an okay episode that started well but dipped after the first ten minutes. Kim thinks he is a member of an alien race that he is slowly turning into, interesting but nothing new, with a terrible ending and plot that doesn't seem to be going anywhere!"
2,Cute idea but not well executed,"Cute idea for a story, but unfortunately not very well executed. The illustrations are nice, but the text is extremely long for a picture book. I also wasn't a huge fan of how blatantly moralistic some of the text was, and *I'm* a vegetarian! Example: ""I don't ask you to stop eating meat, so why do you ask me to stop eating vegetables?"""
1,terribly disappointed,"I was appalled when I opened this book to read to my children, ages three and four. The gory details of an execution, pictures of dragons eating people, name-calling using the word ""idiot"", a picture of a wild boar leg with blood dripping from it, the vegetarian protagonist being chained , tied , and shackled on nearly half the pages - I couldn't believe this was supposed to be a children's book! I was definitely expecting something more gentle and peaceful. For a book which has been touted as promoting acceptance and tolerance, I found the actual violence portrayed to be unacceptable."
2,Poor signal reception,The sad part about this replacement antenna is my BROKEN antenna gets a better signal reception than this new antenna. I don't know if it is simply defective but I have never had dropped calls so frequent on my i730 while at home. Mind you I have a headset attached to my phone and hold the phone up. I used to typically have 4 bars of signal previously and now average about 1-2 bars. I can switch to the broken antenna and get 3 bars. I plan to purchase an OEM antenna replacement for this.
1,Nortech Navigator,Purchased from Sams club. Aftrer 2 months power cord broke could not find replacement. Looked on net for Web page for Nortech with no luck. I would not recommend this unit.
3,Sunpak,Older model that has a long recharge. But It is great for a beginner. I wouldnt reccomnd it for someone who want to be more than a hobbyist.
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"I hate wasting money. This is just junk. Whatever happened to metal trays in dog crates? My puppy had this plastic ""replacement"" tray broken in 2 weeks and could have easily gotten cut. Larger dogs crack the trays because their weight causes stress cracks in the plastic due to pressure exserted on the uneven surface of the wire frame below. ""Replacement"" is the key word here. Notice the word guarantee is never mentioned. A quality item shouldn't have to sell replacement parts on amazon! You get what you pay for. A crate is a large investment item for any dog owner and Midwest is not producing a quality product. Get a General Cage crate or tray instead."
2,Does not fit properly in the kennel,"It is a tad smaller on all sides making it not fit snuggly in the bottom of my kennel. According to the photo, I assumed it'd have a little more of a lip on the sides as well. Overall not happy but I guess it's serving it's purpose."
4,Good Value,"Fast service and great price! Is just a bit to small for for our 42 in crate, but otherwise it fits well. I was looking for an inexpensive replacement since our Doberman will destroy it eventually!"
5,Simple and enjoyable.,"I got this little book for my father who loves history. He especially likes war stories so this book was perfect for him, it took him like 2 or 3 days to finish it and he thought it was really interesting.Is kind of like little facts about all source of battles. It makes a perfect gift."
1,"Horrible product, didn't work and fell apart",Got the battery. Lasted one charge. Does not recharge. Plastic cover peeled off and it won't fit in the camera.
3,Sesame Street Meets Fairy Tale,"""Silly Storytime"" is a journey to a fairy-tale land with Elmo and his Sesame Street friends in retellings of ""Rapunzel,"" ""Sleeping Beauty,"" ""Jack and the Beanstalk,"" and ""Little Red Riding Hood.""Zoe wishes she has longer hair just like Rapunzel, but when her Hairy Godperson grants her wish, it puts Zoe in a predicament. Prince Elmo tries to break an evil spell cast on Sleeping Grouchy that makes her sleep for 100 years. His other Sesame Street pals help Jack grow a beanstalk. Finally, the Big Bad Wolf and Little Red Riding Hood sing about the parts of a face in a musical version of the classic tale.An added bonus is a quartet of ""Kermit News"" segments starring Kermit the Frog."
4,FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE,"A wonderful book on a fascinating subject. Russian architecture is so varied, I really had no idea and this book is exhaustingly thorough. I especially enjoyed the section on Imperial Russian Architecture and the later Soviet Architecture. It is obvious how Speer influenced Soviet architecture, his Third Reich Berlin may have never been realized, but his spirit it is alive and well in Soviet buildings. If you have any interest in Russia or architecture or just well researched, scholarly books, then i cant imagine you being disappointed."
4,Mouse is a hit at our house!,"My son loves to read about Mouse. With this book, he guesses what it is that Mouse is looking at or what Mouse is doing. This book has helped to build his excitement for Christmas."
3,It was OK!,I thought this book was an ok reading book. I am in 8th grade and I thought it was a little young for me. It could have been better.
1,Totally [quit working correctly],"I used it for a few months, and now I have a Zire. It did ok for a while. Although it was slow to work with (the touch screen wasn't very sensitive, and it often came up with the letter next to the one I actually wanted), it worked on a limited basis. It wasn't convenient in that I couldn't enter one entry and make it repeat over a series of days. But it did remind me of things with the reminder and alarm functions. Also, the address book worked well. But after about 9 months, it suddenly stopped working. It wasn't the batteries -- it just keep freezing up on me. And the alarm would just go off for no reason in a long, annoying tone. The only way to unfreeze it or stop the alarm was to reset it. It even got so bad that every time I made an entry it froze. You'd be better off getting something higher-level that will last."
3,Not the cleanest factory..,"This item arrived as pictured, but when I took it out of the package I realized both rings were covered with a black oily substance. They washed off okay, but jeez, this is an item for processing food."
3,"Ok, but....","Indeed, I received what I asked for, and even though the shipping fee was as much as the cost of the sealing rings, I agreed to pay so I cannot complain about that. The problem was that it took forever to receive it. I ordered on dec 28 and was expected to receive the rings no later than January 7. On the 8th, I contacted the seller and had to do it again because they did not respond right away. Three days later, they contacted me, apologized, and told me they would resend the sealing rings. About a week later, I finally got them."
3,BETTER DEAL THAN BUYING THINGS INDIVIDUALLY,"I bought this when I received my DS Lite for Christmas of 2007 and there were a few accessories I knew I would want.First of all - a small carrying case. This one does well.I wanted a car charger, holder for some games and ear buds. An extra stylus would be handy, too.This package had all the accessories that I wanted at the time, plus a few extra items...some of which I doubted that I'd ever use. But, the price was right and all there in one fell swoop.So far, everything has held up and works okay. Some of the items I haven't messed with, but for what I wanted, it worked out fine.It just depends on what you want in accessories."
1,disappointed,"I bought the Nintendo DS for my child for Christmas. The Ninetendo DS Lite Travel Kit was listed as an accessory for my purchase so I bought it. This product is for the ""lite"" and does not work with my purchase. Very disappointing......"
5,It's like a swiss army knife,"This travel kit has just about everything you will need for your DS(minus a game). It is basicly a DS swiss army knife, where you can pull out whatever you need for any situiation. PLenty of stuff make it a good deal as well."
4,very handy and useful,It is pretty much all you need. I have not had smelly problem with which some other products were reviewed. All of them were pretty useful except the screen cleaner w/ bonus cartridge holder 'cause it made the strap very clunky so I took them out.
3,"OK, but don't expect a lot","I love these Archive Series type of books to get inspiration for crafts and art. Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed with this particular one since it shows the best stuff on the cover and a few on the inside. Mostly there are enormous pictures of approximately 2-3 to a page. In fact, 18 of the 44 pages of illustration are large, single images. The illustrations are good in that there is not a lot of clutter (lots of clean spaces) and can be used as cameos, or 2 color contrasts. However, I must say that this book is not the pictoral reference that I expected. It really reminds me of a coloring book. On the other hand, the book does make an effort to briefly describe where these pictures were originally from."
4,Good for a plane ride,"This book was a page turner. It held more than enough suspense to keep me going. While the character depth wasn't all it could be, you still cared about their well being. The action in this book was excellent, and even though the plot sounds thin, that is probably the way that information was found on the Russian Akula class subs. A fine read, and I'll watch for the next Silent Service to come out."
4,Riker does it again,"Riker just keeps on turning out great books. This one is no different. He went from Navy Seals to the Silent Service without a hitch. I have read every one of his books and I,m not going to stop now."
1,Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe 3.0,"Although this product has the ""Hallmark"" name on it, the quality of the software inside is extremely disappointing! Sierra's attempt at a decent Card program proves itself to be a complete JOKE! With FEW graphics to choose from for each project you may attempt, this awkward software inhibits your imagination from creating anything unique. If you don't believe me, try it yourself (YOU WILL NOT BE HAPPY WITH THIS SOFTWARE). If you don't like it, Seirra promises a ""full refund"" if you mail the complete package back to them (at your expense). ""THE REFUND TAKES 8-10 WEEKS TO RECEIVE"" according to the Sierra customer service rep I talked with. I STRONGLY SUGGEST PURCHASING SOMETHING ELSE!!"
5,LOVED IT!,"Always keeps me guessing, and on the edge of my seat. I love the characters, each one for a different reason. I love the idea of heroes battling the dark."
2,Ok. Should have bought in a store.,The holder for the DVDs were broken so every time I open the case it just falls out. Not cool. Other than that the DVD plays well.
2,"Not Divine, Indeed!","Badly-written, over-wrought, and certainly not ""Divine."" Jay was Divine's manager for the last few years of his life, when the actor was trying--with no success at all--for a singing career. This book was written without the cooperation of John Waters or any of the Dreamland crowd, and it shows. Divine's acting roles are glossed over, as is his very real talent as a performer. No sense of his light-hearted personality comes through in this dark, humorless tale. Ignore this book, go out and rent some of the star's great performances: Pink Flamingos, Female Trouble, Hairspray, Trouble In Mind. You won't find Divine between these covers."
4,DIVINE THE PERSON,"THIS BOOK IS A FASCINATING LOOK AT DIVINE'S HUMAN SIDE. I RECOMMENED THIS BOOK TO ANY DIVINE FAN. IT CHRONICLES DIVINE'S TURBULENT LIFE GROWING UP, BECOMING A CULT STAR, HIS CAREER UP'S AND DOWN'S, HIS CAREER REBIRTH, AND, FINALLY, HIS TRAGIC DEATH. THIS BOOK HAS IT ALL."
1,"Poor quality, workmanship and consistency","I ordered 3 gowns in the same size in 3 colors and they arrived in three different styles! None of the styles looked like the one on the website. They had gathers in different places on the bodice, and fit differently: one was too tight and one was too loose. Also the pink one was hot pink not the pretty baby pink on the website. When I returned them, ""Aimee"" deducted $8 for shipping them to me. I had to pay to ship them back too. So I was out about $15. It was a lousy experience. I would not recommend these gowns to anyone."
1,Terrifying listening experience!,"This is so bad I cannot even adequately describe the level of incompetence. The QR boys didn't know where they wanted to go with this album. It opens okay with Cold Day in Hell, although you can hear them trying to conjure up the glory days with a bass line and rhythm very similar to Metal Health. But after this track it is just unlistenable. What a f'n abortion. Unnecessary acoustic intros, awkward slide guitar with DuBrow trying to sing over top, and Cavazzo throwing in harmonics that seem misplaced, almost trying to say ""look at me, I'm good enough"". I don't know....wait, yes I do, this is horrible. Terrible song writing is the main problem. I couldn't put this back on the shelf fast enough. QR III and Quiet Riot are much better. I'm sorry boys but the title couldn't have been more appropriate, and I'm sure the record label felt the same. This surely put them under. Luckily, Quiet Riot would release much better music than this mess on future releases."
3,Difficult to use,"For an overview of Fostoria, it's fine, but I found it difficult to use when looking for specific information about a specific pattern."
5,"Excellent, but where's the DVD?",I'm familiar with lead singer David Alejandro Ruiz from his days with the late and highly under-appreciated Austin band Melting Picassos. It's great to hear his promise fullfilled in this recording. Don't let the fact that it is almost completely Spanish language keep you from listening - it's exciting music in any language and you can find the English lyrics on the Del Castillo webstite. Please note that the DVD referred to in several of the reviews is no longer packaged with this CD.
4,one for the books,"Yeah that new busta is ""big bangin"" u can actually hear what he is talkin about, the one that stands out for me is ""legend of the fall offs"" i wonder if it is directed at someone?"
2,Broke Within Days,"This watch was very nice looking and I really did like it, however the second hand ended freezing within a few days and I had to return it. Because the company was out of stock they refunded my money. Awful product, but good customer service."
4,Good reference,"I am an old nurse stuck in my ways, so I found this reference a bit difficult to use at first. All tests are in alphabetical order instead of being divided by type, but that actually is an advantage I suppose. There are a couple great cross references - one in the beginning where you can look up common disorders and it lists what tests are recommended (NICE!) and of course the index in the back where it also lists the common abbreviations and tells you what the actual name of the test is/ where to find it etc. Great book, up to date, easy to understand, complex enough to explain what the test is for, how it works, how to collect, what the results mean, teaching recommendations, consideration etc. Just wish I had gotten it in hardcover...."
4,Steiner 8x30 Safari Binocular,Steiner 8x30 Safari Binocular is great for my 9 yrs old son. It is much better than the one I bought few weeks earlier and ended up returning the product (I bought Bushnell 12 x 50mm Powerview Wide-Angle Binoculars from Walmart online). Steiner makes good binocular. The shipment from the vendor was prompt. I'm happy with this purchase.
5,Quality you would expect from Steiner,"These binoculars have good clarity and field of view. The eye relief is sufficient for me to use them without pushing my glasses up. This is important for my father, as the vision in his one eye has deteriorated to the point that without his glasses there is not enough adjustment in most binos.The eyepieces are indexed so that people can pass them back and forth with minimal trouble. One thing to note is that these are no center adjust. You adjust them for distance and they are focused down to about 30' or so. This makes them inconvenient for looking at things close up, but from 50' and out you never need to focus. Might be problem for birdwatchers, but it works for me.One aside is that they do have the weight of fullsize binos, so an important consideration is how much you need to carry them. I find myself using a pair of compact as much or more when I am going out for all day."
2,not high quality,"Given the cost of this sunshade, I am disappointed. The quality of the shade is not up to the mini standard. It is going to wear out and look terrible in no time."
4,Great band,"I have seen this band live. The lead has great stage presence and the band sounds great. The CD doesn't sell them short either (live is always better, but the CD has great quality sound.) I hope this band will go far...they deserve it!So try them out!"
4,Nice power supply for the money!,"I used this power supply to run my PC with a Pentium 4 3GHz CPU. It has dual 12V rails that are 10A and 15Amps, respectively. 5V is 22A, 3.3V is 21A. (Granted it is only a 350W power supply, it's not bad). Has 1 PCIe 6 pin. Great for the money!"
4,Anchovy Paste tingles the senses,"I am a new user of anchovy paste, and find it completes many of my snacks with a perfect sodium-rich kick. Just like eating anchovies, but in this case, the anchovies are in a tube and you squeeze them out. I squeeze it on a cracker, or sometimes on a slice of cheese. I have seen it squeezed into a plate of rice and cheese. This is the perfect addition to any bland food activity."
2,Not much mystery here,"I've been reading Anne Perry's novels since she started writing them. Maybe I've simply outgrown them, and the Victorian mores that I found fascinating decades ago have palled. I found myself skimming over the tedious insights into the complex emotions of the various characters that fill so many long paragraphs. Defend and Betray seemed to plod on forever. The motivation for the murder was apparent to me long before Hester and Monk figured it out, probably only a third of the way through.I had only read one book of the Monk series prior this, and that was several years ago. That distance in time, along with the ensemble approach - Monk, Hester and Rathbone - to solving the mystery in Defend and Betray, perhaps kept me from being interested in the back story of Monk's former love. Had I not been reading Defend and Betray for book club, I probably would not have stuck it out to the courtroom scenes where the dialogue between canny lawyers and witnesses somewhat redeemed the book."
5,Highly recommended,"If your looking for a good reference book for information on prescription and non-prescription drugs, this is one of the best choices for patients and consumers. It is big and heavy and covers most of the drugs your likely to encounter. Some non-prescriptions drugs (such as dandruff shampoo) are excluded from the print edition due to size considertions. Its an expensive book to buy new through Amazon but buy it from one of the vendors and it can be obtained for under $10...a great bargain. Buy it and the PDR POCKET REFERENCE TO PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, they compliement each other. THE PDR is based on information provided by Drug companies while the USP is developed independently of Drug companies."
3,You get what you pay for,"Definitely not a quality video recorder, but it's alright to play around with. I have problems with it freezing up and skipping around while recording. But if you just want a cheap little video camera, it's easy to hook up to a tv."
1,"If all the christians believe this book, good?",I hope every christian born-again reads this a believes every single word... As a Dr. I couldn't stop laughing at this idiotatic book
2,"Not very interesting, or well written.","The book sounded interesting, but was a boring, difficult read. I have a scientific background and have read similar books but I could not get past the 20% point in this one.I recommend this one instead:The Disappearing Spoon: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements"
2,Did no one else notice the horrible grammar?,"There is a lot of interesting history that Emsley has compiled here, but this needed a second run through the editor's office. The grammar in this is so poor it makes it very hard to read and even harder to enjoy. Also, the organization is half-arsed at best. I was very, very disappointed with this - so much potential, and such a huge let-down after Elmsley's other book ""The 13th Element"".Two stars in stead of one, because what I was able to flesh out before giving up was pretty entertaining."
1,Do not buy this power supply!,"I build and take care of hundreds of computers for a University. I have a degree in Electrical Engineering. I have used many Coolmax@ power supplies. I placed an order for six model CX-400B Coolmax power supplies. Two failed within a couple months, three were DOA. Testing of the units show overvoltage, and lack of voltage control. Many motherboards were tried, the result was rebooting, failure to start and damage to one motherboard!! Warranty at Coolmax says they will replace them, but it shows someone at the company was asleep at the wheel during the production and inspection of this power supply. All of the replacements had the same problems. One star is one too many! Do not buy this power supply."
3,Disappointment with Home Again,"I was disappointed with Home Again because it was so familiar, I believeit is taken from another MacDonald book. His works seem to overlap whichis not a criticism. I love George MacDonald's works and will continue toread all I can.Yvonne Barrett"
3,looks cuter in the picture,it's made of a gross polyester... and the fit isn't quite right. but it's a pretty shade of pink...
2,Dissapointing,"I've been a Mills Bros. fan all my life,and I use to have an excellent anthology of them,which unfortunately was ruined some years ago,So thinking I could try to replace it,I ordered this one(after much research to make sure ALL the right songs were included)Imagine my dissapointment when while listening I immediately noticed that NONE of the tunes I most wanted to hear were the original versions,mostly remakes with big band backing,I played ALL of my old favorites,not a single original in the bunch,I almost cried & I couldn't listen any more.So my search for the difinitive Mills brothers' cd continues..."
4,Social Interest: A Challenge to Mankind,"This later work by Alfred Adler is a very good primer for newcomers to Individual Psychology. Particularly applicible in today's hurried world, Adler shares his wisdom on child rearing. More important, he focuses on the development of social feeling in the individual and its importance to individuals and society as a whole. Adler explains the impact of the development of feelings of ineriority and their dramatic effects on people. He also deals with society's attempts to achieve perfection and the detrimental impact of war, capital punishment, any attempts to place women in an inferior position in society, and a host of other societal issues that are relevant today. The only drawback to this book is his 19th Century position on gays and lesbians. If one can overlook his position on this issue, which may reflect more the views of society at that time, this book will provide invaluable insights."
3,Good for kids,This book has good tricks for kids however some of the directions were hard to understand. Overall there were many great tricks and this is a must have book for any magician.
2,defective,The keyboard was defective. Pressing the i key types ir. Pressing the r key types ir. Pressing the e key types e[.So I'm currently returning for a refund. I hope things go well.Mouse worked well. Cords are little cheap looking.I don't know if it would last long with a kid banging on it.
2,Does not work well with my car,Does not work well on the rear window of my 2000 Subaru Forester. Does not follow the curve of the rear window and the top of the arc does not contact the window.
3,The arcade version would have been a better port,"Of all the titles in the Classic NES series to appear on the GBA, none is more puzzling than Xevious. Originally an arcade title from Namco in the early 80's, Xevious was innovative in it's day, but the conversion to hit the original NES was somewhat lost in translation. This GBA port is a perfect emulation of the NES version, as you pilot your ship and take on hordes of enemy aircraft and ground forces as well. It looks about as good as an 8-bit NES game can, it's fun for a while, easy to get into, challenging (almost too challenging), and you can also save your high score. Despite all that though, the superior arcade version could have been easily ported to the GBA instead, and the fact that Xevious is even in the Classic NES series to begin with is mind boggling in itself."
4,Works Geat under Linux,"I run Slackware Linux 12.0 (recently with 12.2) on my computer, and this adapter card works great. So far, I have only tried it at the default 1.5Gb/s on the hard drive. I really do not need 3.0 Gb/s, but the card supports it. Slackware Linux supports this card directly with no need to add drivers from Promise, but the raw source code is available from Promise if you have an old version of Linux from somewhere. Do not mistake this card for a raid controller. The SATA300 just adds more SATA sockets to motherboards that have too few SATA sockets. The card itself fits into a standard PCI socket on the motherboard. The people who complain that this card does not work on older motherboards must have a very slow PCI bus. My old motherboard is a MSI K8N Neo V2.0.This card is listed in the Linux hardware page below.CRAPPED OUT AFTER 15 MONTHS. Installed another one. Reduced stars to four."
1,Do NOT buy Mcafee Internet Security 4,"This is the worst software I have bought in years. It was a nightmare to install, with multiple errors and crashes. I eventually had to reformat my hard drive. Once I did get it installed it created multiple problems with other applications, most notably making Outlook Express crash. Mcafees technical support is useless, either suggesting we use their phone help (which is only available for a fee), or try to uninstall and reinstall the software. I have uninstalled all but the virus scan software and will go back to using Zone Alarm for my firewall. This product was a waste of money and time - I will never purchase another Mcafee product."
1,Disgusted,"I've had nothing but problems since I installed McAfee Internet Security 4.0 into my computer. I keep getting error messages until I turn McAfee off. If you want tech support you have to call a long distance phone number, & then McAfee charges you a fee to talk to them! There's free tech support on their web page, but they never get back to you!! In a nut shell, I'm out all the money I spent on this software since I can't use it! I would definately recommend not buying McAfee Internet Security 4.0."
1,It's just not worth it.,"I can not recommend this product, it is nothing but trouble from the minute you take it of the box. It permanently locked up my machine using windows XP and was a total disaster when tried with windows 98. It is without doubt the most useless program I have ever seen. Total waste of money."
4,A GREAT REMIX OF BREATHE,"WHEN I WENT TO THIS NEW CLUB IN MY HOMETOWN LAST WEEKEND AND HEARD THE REMIX OF ""BREATHE"", I KNEW I HAD TO OWN THIS CD. LUCKILY, I FOUND IT AT AMAZON.COM AND I AM NOT AT ALL DISAPPOINTED. HEX DOES A TERRIFIC JOB OF RESTRUCTURING THIS TUNE INTO A CLUB CLASSIC. IT IS GREAT AND YOU WILL BE DANCING AFTER ONE LISTEN."

5,No Ordinary Citizen,"This thoroughly-researched and carefully-planned expose of a heinous crime and one victim's journey from woman-in-denial to crusader is a fascinating and speedy read. Engaging the reader from the outset, Mehnert and Dalessandro magage to weave together all the facts, giving us multiple perspectives, even as we empathize with the protagonist, Jane Alexander. Especially revealing and moving is the revelation of the personal journies of Jane and others like her through a criminal justice system that is not always diligent in its pursuit of offenders."
5,Citizen Jane,"An excellent read! David Mehnert is a masterful writer, I could not put the book down. The story is compelling and filled with suspence. Following Jane's walk on the dark side is amazing, watching her come out of this nightmare tale is even more amazing. Good job guys; more, more!Bill Baskin"
1,Dog does not like.,"My Shih-Tzu, a picky eater thus the reason for feeling I need to get him vitamins, won't touch this, even if I hide it in food."
1,Sadly Disappointed,"The optics are good, but the software and the tech service are terrible. I ordered the Celestron NexStar 130 SLT based on glowing reviews I had read. It arrived promptly and was easy to assemble. I was easily able to align the view finder with the main optics, which seemed to be very good. But I was totally unable the align the computer. I made a dozen attempts after entering and re-entering the necessary information and entering the position of various triplets of widely spaced stars, but the computer kept telling me that alignment had failed. I attempted one call to tech service, but was on hold for half an hour before I gave up. I emailed tech service regarding my problem, and received an automatic acknowledgement, but absolutely no further contact over a two week period. Amazon allowed me to return the scope as defective, and even paid the return shipping. So Celestron was terrible, but Amazon was great."
4,Good product; software installation has problems,"Overall, I really like the product. However, I have been on the phone with customer service twice about how it interacts with my palm software (trouble getting the two to synchronize) and had to reinstall the software a couple of times due to glitches which caused the software not to recognize the scanner. My computer also froze shortly after the installation and I have no idea if it was related to the software. After many hours at the repair shop the computer and cardscan seem to be working and when they are I am pleased but I am suspicious that the V. 8 software was not fully tested and that my issues are a result of a premature release. Customer service was patient, available and helpful."
1,Complex with horrible support,"Needless complexity, horrible support that takes forever, help sections is poor. Once you have it running and understand it in and out its a excellent system...however the company doesnt understand the frustrating complexity it puts people through. Plan on hours of education on 'how to use it' whith much of that 'on hold'. Once you have learned it....dont forget it or you will go through all the pain and agony of the horrible customer support again. They need a software revision that will make it customer friendly. Right now it hates customers."
2,Cardscan Discontinues At Your Service without ANY customer notice,"I have used Cardscan for almost ten years. More importantly, I have recommended it to countless clients and have used it exclusively at PGA Tournament events, DESPITE the poor customer service.As I travel frequently, I have come to depend on the 'At Your Service' database backup invaluable. Imagine my amazement and disgust to try to access AtYourService this weekend only to be greeted with a 'We have decided to discontinue this service effective 12.21.11'. NO advance notice! Not even the foresight to provide an industry-partner alternative as they close this vital feature. Not only is this cavalier treatment of clients inexplicable in today's competitive world, but the failure to communicate the upcoming discontinuation is a further reflection of their insensitivity to their client base.BUYER BEWARE."
2,Frequent Errors,"I just installed the Card Scan Executive for my division and am finding discrepencies between the card and the scan image about 30% of the time. As a result, it is necessary to check each scan for errors, which was an unpleasant surprise. Although it is still faster than typing all of the information in yourself, the system is certainly not flawless."
1,Cardscan,A wonderful device if you still use XP or Win 7 x32.Unfortunately it won't work with Win 7 x64. The scanner doesn't have a driver for x64 and the software becomes inoperative in a Win 7 x64 environment.Too bad because it was a 5 star device in a 32 bit environment.Apparently it doesn't generate enough profit for Dymo for them to keep it current.
4,"Backpack delivers as promised, takes a load off! A+","Looking for laptop backpacks that handle 16-17"" screens seems to be a problem lately since more and more laptop mfgrs are making their screens larger, but fewer backpacks can handle them. Fortunately Targus has a reputation for durability and the TSB312 doesn't dissappoint. Takes a huge load off your shoulders with the hip strap(also one across the chest if you desire) and TONS of pockets to hold TWO water bottles, PDA, Cell phone, folders, and SO MUCH MORE! With an 8.5 lb computer(Sony VAIO GRV550) this laptop suits anyone's need to transport without feeling the heavy burden."
1,Was good - somewhat out of date,"While this book may have contained everything you needed to know when it was published, it is out of date."
2,Treats project management as a graphic design process,"I had high hopes for this book when I started reading it. After all, David Seigel is highly regarded around Internet circles as a web design guru. Unfortunately, Siegel's graphic design background permeates his company's project management philosophy for building web sites. Basically, he advocates managing the process of building web sites like you would manage a graphic design project. Whether you agree with this or not (personally I don't), this book only contains about one-tenth of the project management depth of Steve McConnell's 'Software Project Survival Guide'."
5,Sorry I didn't read it when the ink was still wet...,"The information outlined in this book has made me kick myself over and over again- every time I turned a page, I saw another bit of information that would have saved me numerous headaches over the past several years. If you develop any type of web presences you should read this, but for the sake of my business, please don't! Sorry David, but it's a tough world we live in! ;)"
5,Every designer needs a copy of this.,"Secrets of Successful web sites is a must- read. This book talks about RFPs, a project site, and gives case studies of major sites like Women's Wire. Every designer needs a copy of this book."
4,Very good book 1 year ago.,"I love this book. It teaches you a lot about web project management and construction websites to a deadline. But I think it is not well organized. I am looking more for a book that will take you from conception to delivary, while telling you the documents you should produce along the way to document you process. It should also break down the process into content, technology and infrastructure, marketing and post deadline maintenance. This book has a lot of nuggets and was one of a kind, but I expect more today."
5,Very good all in one Scanner,"I am very happy with the purchase. It produces excellent clarity images and comes with a great software to match it. The body is slim unlike any other cannon scanners with slide facility. Produces very good film scanned images. The buttons at front are very useful, especially the PDF one that produces a PDF document out of the scan. If you use scanner often and occusanionally use the film scanner than this is the best i have seen."
5,Blitzkrieg Anthology,"Blitzkrieg Anthology is very easy to install on your PC and once it is up & running there are so many missions to play it is great.The Grey Panzers is one of the best Mod's that have been created for this platform,excluding Kursk because I personally won't purchase a download and prefer actual software in case it has to be uninstalled.I do recommend this game to anyone who enjoys WWII real time stragedy games it will not disapoint and it is way better then the Close Combat series and this product gets a thumbs up fro me."
5,"The best ""WARGAME"" ever.",The answer to all true wargamers dreams. All the action of an RTS with all the control of a turn-based game. The units are modeled beautifully and act realistically (after you learn to use them) ... Perfect!
3,"Good concept, but...",I loved the concept of having a set amount of troops and equipment. Figured this game would be a great game to use real tactics and not the standard RTS bum rush technique.The game actually stumbles when it comes to playing against the computer. You will end up having to reload previous saved games to make it through a mission because the computer is very good.I found myself spending more time reloading saved games and saving every couple of minutes than playing the game as a true strategy game.
3,Uh....Ok...but don't buy it...,"I read this book for a book report and it was interresting, but not captivating. I feel for some of the characters and some of the things that they do, but sometimes I wanted to burn the book. Susan Elderkin clearly wanted to confuse her readers and then tell them the ending half way through.I am an avid reader, and I do agree that her character descriptions were good, but the book overall was not suspensful, nor was it intriguing. I've read it 5 times combing it for things for my book report and character profiles, and you find something different every time because of the great detail she uses. So if you're into detail, this book is great. If you want something suspenseful pick up something else. I personally enjoyed ""The Cabinet of Curiosities"" much more than this book...leave this one and go buy the other...you'll be much happier in the end."
5,ABSOLUTE FUN,"The selection of songs and groups on this cd are perfect. It is the right mix to enjoy all your favorite cartoon hits of the 70's and a few newer ones. The majority of groups on this cd play the songs as you remember them with a little touch of their own and their own sound, that in most cases works incredibly. Some of the best are Collective Soul - ""The Bugaloos"", Ramones - ""Spider Man"", Dig - ""Fat Albert"", Mary Lou Lord - ""Sugar Sugar"" and Juliana Hatfield and Tanya Donelly with ""Josie and the Pussycats"". What these groups did with these sometimes silly theme songs is give them an edge and turn the into legitimate rock songs. Frente! does a great version of the Pebbles Flintstone song ""Open Up Your Heart.."". It will bring back alot of memories to all you Flintstone viewers and anyone who rode the ""TV Ride"" at Kings Island (outside of Cincinnati) in the mid to late 70's. Enjoy this one it is a fnatasic, fun flashback."
2,Saturday Morning Cartoons,"This CD is definetly not meant for young children(I bought it for my 6 year old). The ""headbanging"" sound many of the songs have are nothing like what I remember as a kid. Only 2 or 3 songs would I care to hear again. As well the CD Cover is different than the plain t.v pictured on the site. Zombie like people who look like they've O.D.'d on more than just cartoons, and a skull in the corner..."
5,Pureology products are the best!,"This conditioner is so thick and does it's job so well. I've been using the shampoo for quite a while and loveit so when I needed another bottle of conditioner, I chose Pureology. I have a short haircut and only useabout a bottle a year as you only need very little product to get the benefits of the conditioner. The priceisn't prohibitive from that standpoint."
2,not good for me,I used this product because I was told it was created without chemicals by the inventors for his wife who had cancer. How true this story is I don't know however it irrated my scalp I give it only one star as I am sensative to many chemicals. If you are sensative I would not recommend this.
1,Not satisfied at all,Picture resolution is very poor after pics are transferred to the computer. Shutter delay is way too long to catch intended pic.
1,Not the complete series,"When I first heard the news that Gaiking had been licensed, it came on the heels of Discotek's Mazinger announcement and I was pumped to hear that yet another old robot show was getting some love. But then I read that the Gaiking release was going to be ""abridged."" The product description says everything you need to know: 330 minutes over two disks does not come close to accounting for a 44-episode television series.I realize that modern audiences may not appreciate the repetitive nature of old robot shows, which were essentially 24-minute toy commercials featuring the same poorly-animated action sequences as a new villain was trashed each week. But really, if you're not going to sell me the entire show, don't bother."
4,Left of Center,There's little question where Bracey stands with this book. Still it has good information educators need.
5,New York Undercover always had the greatest music!,The episodes weren't bad either. If anyone needs a copy of the series just email me.
5,Very COOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THE GRAPHICS ARE SWEET!!!!!! THE GAME PLAY IS AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!I'VE PLAYED POKEMON FOR A LOOOONG TIME!!! BUT THIS IS THE BEST EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,not fit,"If you have a glass jar, don't even bother, the thing does not fit, it is to short, it could not make a good grip, when you tried to make a grip, the base pop out, I really don't know if is the model, I thought it will work for every model, glass or plastic, but I think it does not."
3,"I like it, but...","I bought this blender in July and was pleased with it's performance. However, it's hard to see if you're placing the jar on the base properly because of the jar skirt. Then it wouldn't start and I saw that the threaded jar bottom had somehow cracked. I now have to order this part which isn't cheap. I hope this is why it didn't start. I'll keep you posted!Oster BVLB07-Z00 Counterforms 3-Speed 2-in-1 Blender/Food-Processor Combo with 48-Ounce Glass Jar"
2,"Cheap, cheap, cheap!","This item is NOT an Oster replacement, but rather some poorly made after-market product. It did not thread properly on my blender (which is only 1 year old) and had bits around the edges that were not properly molded and flaked off. Up close it truly doesn't even look like the one I'm replacing.I guess I'm going to have to bite the bullet and pay the extra money in shipping to purchase this product directly from Oster. (By the way...Oster does NOT warranty any part of the blender except the motor. Really disappointing from such an old and well-known company). Anyway, this thing is definitely going back. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because shipping was fast."
5,Better than the item I replaced!,I guess I was a lucky one who got the strong sturdy replacement. This replacement item was far better quality then the one that came with my blender! My original base was a thin light weight plastic. The replacement is considerably sturdier plastic and feels as though it will hold up much better than the original. Very very impressed and pleased!
2,Not the same jar base as my original base,My original blender jar base cracked after 6-7 years of constant use. I doubt this replacement will last 6 months. It's not as thick as the original and it is very hard to get it screwed on straight. Priced too high for the product. Wished I had just spent the money on a new blender..........
2,More bad news,I have a very hard time putting it on the base of the jar almost like it is not the right one.
1,Cheap Junk! Don't waste your money!,"This replacement piece barely lasted a year. Then it broke just like its predecessor - and all the food - a wonderful organic cream of asparagus soup - went to waste ! It's so frustrating and a holy mess! Soup all over the counter tops, in the drawers and on the kitchen floor. Never again Oster!"
3,Ok,An ok read. I found the story line extremely predictable. This is one of those books that manages to barely keep you interested enough to stop from leaving the book unfinished. I would not buy any other offerings by this author.
3,"Bad quality, but very handy","Pros: Light-weight. Pen-like feeling, so it's easy to maneuver. Has a 3 level trimming adapter. Comes with 3 different trimming blades in different sizes. Batteries last pretty long.Cons: If you don't hold it perpendicular to your skin, it might grab it a little, but it pinches, it doesn't really hurt. It's bad quality, so it feels like it will break easily, but 2 years so-far and it still works fine. Still not as thin as it could have been for better visibility and control, but so-far the thinnest I've found.Suggestions: Hold it as perpendicular to your skin as you can. Use the smaller blades if possible, they are more quiet and do not pinch your skin as much if you accidentally put the razor parallel to your skin. Do not take apart any part of it, they will break if you try."
1,Awful!,i bought this as a gift for someone. i was disappointed when the person told me it doesnt work. tried fixing it but it refuses to work. dont ever buy. its a waste of money!!!!
5,great product,It just like the description and the envelopes work fine. I like the adhesive strip. Order these if you need 1/2 sheet envelopes!
4,what can be said,"EVERYONE needs a single-disc CD player, it lasts longer....less moving parts, it's elementary. I purchased mine one year ago, and it works perfectly. Sound is very good, and it does everything it says it does. Don't expect a lot of bells a whistles with this thing, it's a basic CD player. At this price I am considering buying another because I was under the assumption that this devise was being discontinued by TEAC. Good buy for a very good price. Please, stay away from multiple disc CD players, thay all fail too soon for the price point. This unit delivers at this price point. A good buy."
5,Valiant,"This is the second book, following ""Tithe"", and while I enjoy this book too, it's not as entertaining to me as the first. I guess for me, the setting may have some to do with why I like the other one better. This one is set in NYC, and it's very gritty, dirty, painful, real. ""Tithe"" is in NJ, in a forest, by the ocean, in a home. I guess I like to get away when reading. ""Valiant"" is very real, and there are times when I can feel the pain and loneliness felt by Val. I still highly recommend this book."
2,Tithe is better!,"I read tithe and was hoping this would be like it BUT it is not. It is very different drugs sex and magic, the ending is the best part with a little romance."
4,"Good, but not as good as the first","This book is enchanting, enjoyable, and easy to read. However, it was not quite as good as the first or third books. However, I still recommend that you read it as part of the series.I was a bit suprised at the adult themes in the book, I would not let anyone under 14 read it."
4,Valiant,"When I first started this book, I wasn't sure I would like it as much as I liked Tithe. My advice is to stick with it! It ended up being a good read. Although it doesn't seem to have connections to Tithe other than the fact that it deals with Faerie, characters from this book show up in Ironside, the actual sequel to Tithe. If you have already read Ironside, I don't think that there is information that will ruin Valiant for you, and I would still read it. I would recommend this book to teens who liked Tithe, enjoy fantasy and even those who like books that are more realistic and are looking for something a little out of their comfort zone because of the very real and 'human' conflicts that plague the main characters."
4,Liked even better than Tithe,"I really liked the book Tithe, but loved Valiant even more. Gritty, interesting, original.. Haven't read Ironside yet though..."
4,Teac R-H500 Nifty little deck,"Just what I was looking for. Seems these are hard to buy. Works good! I would like to find the CD deck to go along with it. Can't say how it will hold up as I really don't use it that much, but I do like the smaller size but nice features."
2,"I learned some things, but it was a chore to get through","This book follows a fairly typical rock bio timeline for The Stone Roses. I was very interested to learn about the ""wilderness years"" and what happened within the band to make the Second Coming such a rubbish follow up to the brilliant debut. I didn't find the facts very deep or compelling for that section, but the early years info was very good. I'd had no idea they were chugging away at it for so many years before the debut album's release. However, if this book is any indication, John Robb is a sub-par writer, repeating phrases and descriptions in adjacent paragraphs on almost every third page. It becomes infuriating after a while and I really had to push myself to get to the end. I also must take him to task for using ""myriad"" incorrectly a handful of times (unless that's a British thing, like saying ""aluminium""). This book seriously needs an editor if it's going to go into another edition."
3,"Fairly well researched, but lacks any new insight","The book starts off promisingly with a review of the Blackpool show, but soon falls into a rather muddled writing style. The most disappointing part about this book is that Robb (someone who claims to be there when it happened) fails to interview any of the four Roses. Pretty much every quote is from a previous press interview. So we never really find out why Reni quit or what the band was doing between the two albums or the background behind the fractious recording of 'Second Coming'. Other than that, it's an interesting account of the band, but definitely written from a fan's perspective."
2,Uninteresting film of Maugham's Gauguin novel,"Herbert Marshall once again plays Maugham and George Sanders has a field day as a true cad who cares for no one and nothing but himself as he deserts wife, family, career to paint. Thinly disguised biography of Paul Gauguin. Acting is stilted, production values are quite poor. Oscar nom for Score. Original last reel with walls of paintings in Tahiti was in Color - this print is not."
2,Barely a two,"What a mess of a film. For the first hour or so we learn that that the painter was an amoral scoundrel, leaving his family and others because he wants to be alone and paint. Then he's in France, breaking up another man's family. And finally, he's in Tahiti, where the picture turns brown, and then, briefly, technicolor--our only real look at anything the painter produced. After marrying a native woman and becoming a father, the painter dies and a sign warns us of the evil of his ways. The End.The script is long and tedious, the photography is at times clumsy, the sets are cheapo, and the acting is so-so. One feels sorry for George Sanders, who was making the B ""Falcon"" series during the same year. He simply had to appear unconcerned and wooden. Herbert Marshall, who narrates the film, is adequate, but he spends his time onscreen gasping about the immorality of the painter. Does anyone truly care? This is entertainment?"
2,Should Include Earplugs!,"This little horn produces such a shrill shrieking sound it should come with earplugs or a muffler to insert into horn. Cute concept, but manufacturer should have done a better job of making a musical instrument.(If the native American Indians and other tribal cultures can create flutes from hollowed out sticks, and percussion instruments from dried up seeds inside of gourds that produce beautiful sounds) -- then this company failed miserably. If I bought this at a physical store - it would be returned. Be warned. Buy earplugs."
4,Fun!,"Young Deanna Durbin at her best. Good all around cast, will make you smile and want to rent more Deanna Durbin films."
3,the item works pretty well,i think that the sony ericcson stereo headset works like a charm i love it for when i am driving
4,Journey Into Healing,"This book uses poetry as an introduction to its prose reflections, reflections which consist of spiritual meditations, commentary, thought provoking questions, and personal biblical interpretation. The author, as she did in her book ""Sacred Voices,"" focuses on the perspectives of women, this time moving beyond Genesis to include Esther, Hannah, Ruth, and Naomi. The book is intended to help people as they, like their biblical ancestors, struggle with the age old problem of pain. The poetry is not particularly sonorous, but it does grapple with heavy themes, and it serves as a solid jumping board for the author's reflections."
2,Not worth it,The first edition was much betterno new photos just reprints from the first edition and from other publicationsIf you have the first of the series DON'T buy this one
4,Fairly good book,"Fairly good book. What I don't like about it is that it doesn't have the information about each engine in one point. You have to read all through the book to gather up all the info on one engine. For this to have been a GREAT book, each engine should have been addressed individually, not scattered throughout the whole book."
1,What an ugly little movie!,"It appears that the only reason for this movie is to emphasize bad language, bad situations, and bad people. Everyone is a loser and very little changes throughout the movie, except for the obvious . . Matthew Boderick always seems to play the guy who gets redeemed. What an ugly little movie."
5,"Jaded, fun, interesting to watch and with just the right dose of realism","Mathew Broderick has become a favorite actor of mine. I never was a Ferris Bueller fan, but after seeing ""Election"" I really started liking Broderick's work. ""Biloxi Blues"" was great too. ""Finding Amanda"" starts off at a pretty jaded pace, but at the same time it hits the nail right on the head with its characters coming to grips with who they are, though mostly the tone is light and comedic with black humor undertones.It's interesting from beginning to end (a strange scenario) and easy to watch. His wife is the woman who played Jim Carrey's wife in ""Liar Liar"", and she puts in a similar performance which works. Broderick's character of sympathetic loser is comparable to his character of high school teacher in Election (great movie). If you liked either of those movies I think you'd like this as well. I found it wholly entertaining. It had a very appropriate ending."
3,What a strange movie!,"Let me preface this, my husband bought this from a bargain bin so we paid next to nothing for it. With that said, it's an interesting movie. It's a dry comedy with a sad story. Broderick's character is addicted to alcohol and gambling. He decides to go to Vegas to find his niece who is a hooker and supposedly on drugs. It's a depressing story about poor decisions from both characters. There are scenes that made my husband and I uncomfortable but others we laughed at. It's not a movie I'd loan to most of my friends but it was an interesting movie to watch. I'd say rent it before buying it unless you can find it in a bargain bin."
4,I love the looks and price,"Shifter leaves a little to be desired. 3rd to 4th and, 4th to 5th shifts are pretty iffy. I'm gonna try to adjust it. If that doesn't work I will just upgrade to a better shifter. Thanks, Rich"
3,Beware of Shipping Damages,"If you order ANY bike from Amazon, Beware of the Shipping Damage. AMAZON has a contract with FEDEX that states FEDEX is not responsible for any Damages caused by shipping, and you have to take it up with AMAZON. This Means they can Smash it, and tell you ""tough luck Call Amazon""Call Amazon and its the run around, ship it back, 3- 4 weeks, are you sure it was damaged by shipping, etc.Go visit a bike shop.. do not buy one from Amazon, unless you like buying a new damaged Bike."
4,Good first bike.,When I decided to try bicycling I had no idea where to start.After looking at hundreds of bikes I ordered the Pacific Shorewood. It arrived in good shape and time and I put it together in about an hour. I have rode several hundred miles nowand had a flat tire once!!! I have had no problems with this bike and would recommend it to anyone getting into bicycling for the first time and not wanting to invest too much into it at first.
4,Great Buy!!!,"Pacific Shorewood Men's 26-Inch Cruiser BikeI ordered this bike after carefully searching the internet on many other sites. I found that for the money this was by far, the best deal. The bike arrived 5 days after it was ordered. Upon opening the box I found that it had been ""Double Boxed"", I guess due to a history of damages. I assembled the bike in no time. I had no problems , or no missing or damaged parts. (I did have to search through the box to find the nut for the front fender mounting bolt). The bike has a few scratches on it. It would help if it was bubble wrapped inside the shipping box. I have had problems getting the gears adjusted right, but that may be that it has been many years since I have done this. Over all I am very pleased and would highly recommend this bike to anyone."
1,What Was I Thinking?,"If ever I wanted to hear this one record that I own from my small record collection, I would have to buy a new turntable because that recording was made in 1966 and was never released in any other format. I thought the Teac P-988 at $90 would serve my purpose. What was I thinking? Even if I had been able to get this turntable to produce any sound I would not have kept it and I would still rate it 1 star because 0 star is not an option at Amazon. This unit is so cheap that it's embarassing. I returned it and got the Audio-Technica AT-PL120 at $220 from Amazon. Now there's a turntable that will make all your records sound super fine for just a few more dollars."
3,Cheap,"I bought this for my daughter, but never gave it to her. It is cheap looking and I thought that would upset her."
3,Good To A Point,"Like Maxell UR, this tape is a good general recording tape. It is intended for general voice and music recordings. Like Maxell UR, you can get away with recording cds if the music is not so intense. (Interestingly, if the cds are not so over the top, they may not require a high bias cro2 cassette. Some of my cds transferred quite nicely onto normal bias cassettes.) However, like Maxell UR and Sony HF, the TDK D will not suffice for recording cds that have high intensity. If you are looking to record from Exodus, King Diamond, or 80s groups that didn't sell out, you need to look towards Maxell XL II or TDK SA."
1,Very Unhappy,"This back pack has many problems. First of all, the tag guarantees that if it were to fall in water it would be waterproof. Well I found out the hard way that this is not true. I was at the river this weekend, and my bag fell in the water... 1/4 of the bag filled with water! The front pocket also filled with water. Do not get this unless you plan to use it only in light rain with no risk of it landing in water.Secondly, I used to use this for commuting on my bike in Portland (rains all the time). The back pack held up ok, but it has no pockets other than the front small one. If you want any sort of organization for your items, I would look for a different bag. I have switched to a Banjo Bros. bag which has more pockets and is constructed better.... It has an extra lining so that you can clean the inside when it gets wet.Lastly, the straps are really cheap and uncomfortable.In conclusion, this bag is way overpriced for what you get, and don't believe the waterproof tag!"
5,Owned!,"I am the proud owner of a CD copy. This is indeed a great album that needs to come back in print. But as of now (July, 2012), there are 2 copies for sale. Get yours now while you can."
1,Direct to warranty,"the receiver arrived at a time of earthquakes and hurricanes and I blamed atmospheric anomalies for poor reception, until all was calm and by then reception was nil. It is presently at an authorized service center for repairs. The Amazon thirty day return policy is useless in this case as it only applies to unopenend cartons!"
2,Silent service book,"Rating is more for the shape of the book, but paperbacks are not something I strive to get for my library. I have not read the book yet to verify if the author knows what he's talking about."
1,Review- Simplified,"This book was too basic to be of any use. The book is not set up so one can look up a specific task and then see how to do it. The only book I have ever returned, and I buy two or three books a month."
1,Not impressed,Did not see a difference in output. Not sure if that means my water retention is low or not. Tried it for three days straight.
3,Wasn't worth the money!,"I just honestly did not really like this bike. I really can't put my finger on why, just didn't do anything for me. I just don't care for it. I know one problem is the back brakes don't work, my roommate put it together and did a pretty good job, but for some reason, they just do not work at all. I can see this thing falling apart very quickly, and that doesn't make me happy, considering what I paid for it. Maybe it's just not fast enough, I don't know. I just reallllly didn't like this bike! LOL!"
2,Very Poorly Manufactured,"Received this bike as a gift for our daughter for Christmas. My husband removed it from the box to find that the forks were too narrow for the front wheel to fit into and had to bend the forks. The chain was jammed between the derailer and the frame, and took some effort to remove it. The tires were not all the way mounted on the rim. The rims were not ""true"", and most of the spokes had to be tightened. There were dents and scratches on the frame. The fenders were not centered on the tires.If my husband wasn't handy, this bike would have been IMPOSSIBLE to put together. Cheaply manufactured and poorly packaged. I would NOT recommend this bike due to the difficulty putting it together."
1,"Foot Hits Tire!!!! Do not buys this, you will be returning it!","WOW! What a shock to have this issue with this bike. I had read the reviews on various bikes like crazy, and this one stood out far above the rest. I was so excited to get it...it was a cruiser, had gears, and was cute! What more could a girl ask for. Once the bike was together and I took it for my first test drive I ran into a little snag...I could not turn and peddle at the same time...my foot hit the wheel. Granted I am 6 feet tall, and have size 11 shoe, so it could be that I was just too tall for the bike. BUT, it did not work and we did have to return it. None of the reviews mentioned having this problem, so perhaps I am a freak. But, nonetheless, I thought I'd get the word out and save someone the cash."
4,Beautiful with a short screw,The bike is beautiful and rides well. Only problem we had was that it was missing a screw for the front fender.
1,Lost in the Translation,"The book should be seen as a last gasp of cultural but non-practicing Catholics. If you like your religion as bland a WASP, this form of catholocism is for you. JFK brought Roman Catholocism into the mainstream and most people now see it as just another place to go on Sunday. Sadly neither of the authors knows any better. It is doubtful they actually know the faith or what it teaches. Catholicism will always be the ""other"" religion. Liking being a Catholic and actually being one can be summaries by the North Carolina motto ""Esse Quam Videri."" translation ""To be, rather than to seem."""
3,"More Business, Less Gift Basket Oriented","This book does contain some good information about starting your own business as a majority of the information in the book is generalized business information such as business planning, bookkeeping and general marketing. However, I bought this book looking for specific resource information about gift baskets: how to find wholesale suppliers and how to make and package gift baskets. While the author does use some general references about gift baskets, the information is sparse and I was disappointed in the book overall for anyone looking for specific information on gift baskets."
3,One Song,"I only like one song, that is why I got it... I really do not know all the rest of the songs."
5,outstanding!!!,I had a taco party and almsot every single guest asked me How do I make the Corncake?. I run out every year.
4,Love corn cake,"I love chi chi's corn cake and I love that I can purchase it from Amazon. My local grocery store stopped carrying it and I was so happy to see that I could order it from Amazon. I would give it 5 stars but not everyone in my family loves it. (I don't know why, it is so yummy) It is a delicious side to any mexican meal!"
2,thought it would be better,so so.there was great reviews on product only made it once will try it again
4,This album is great,"This is an great Meat Loaf album! Although it dosen't have the power packed ballads that are in Bat 1 and 2, It is one of his best albums. It beats the pants of his CD's from the mid to late 80's. It's probably 3rd on his greastest albums list, although I have yet hear his newest album. I like the upbeat rock songs on this album, especially ""Runnin for the Red Light"". ""Original Sin"" is a more traditional Meat Loaf song, which was penned by Jim Steinman. Overall this a great album, I recommend it highly."
3,"Smells nice, not so fond of the texture","This body cream is lightly scented with a very nice green apple scent- crisp and fruity with a slightly spicy undertone. For those who can't deal with much scent, the fragrance really is quite light (I'd actually prefer if it was a bit stronger). The cream did a good job of moisturizing my legs after a shower, and it was fine to put on right after shaving. My main concern was that the texture is a bit runny and slimy. I prefer a thicker cream. The texture issues are definitely preventing my full enjoyment of the cream."
3,MINT CONDITION,The product was exactly what was shown and described. In mint condition. The light is not so good though. I bought a led bulb for replacement.
1,Not moist...basically $4 for some Kleenex!,"Don't bother with these...I thought I would save some money. They are basically just Kleenex, not individually wrapped...they ended up in the trash. Spend a few extra bucks and get the Bausch and Lomb Sight Savers or similar."
2,Nokia!! Is it Nokia??? Well that's too bad...,"I'm a Nokia fan. Always buy nokia phone.Have 2 of these. Same problems on both.First of all - what's up with the paint????It started peeling off in about a week, leaving ugly scrapes and traces of paint. Okay - I could live with that, I just peeled it off totally.Now it looks ugly. Period.Now I can't hear well. It's not me - it's the phone.So now looking for a new one to replace.Ai ai ai NOKIA....bad one!"
4,Great phone with many features.,"Nokia enhances their S40 interface with Version 3 and I am very pleased with it. The push-to-open button on the side is handy and both screens are beautiful. The camera at 1.3 megapixels works well for this phone, but I would recommend buying a Micro SD card for storing more than just a few, as internal memory is limited. Works great as a Bluetooth modem with EDGE service on T-Moblie using both Macs and PCs. My only complaint with this device is audio quality, as there are occasional pops and clicks. Other than that, it's a good phone overall."
1,Its not Queen as mentioned...Its only Full,Buy it only for your Full size bed and not for your Queen size bed !!!
2,dificult,"on himself, it's an interesting book, but the difference between celtic and norse is sometimes dificult to find. not interesting to put these 2 items in 1 book"
2,Looking for more designs,"For a specific research project, I was hoping to see more unusual designs. I already had most of these in other sources. The book was in great condition; so, I may give it as a gift to another Irish friend."
4,"Not exactly what I wanted, but!","This is not exactly what I wanted, but it will do for now. This patterns are a much larger scale than what I expected, so if you are not adept at mikniature scaling, don't get this book. But it is a great source of information!"
4,yes,this is an extremley beautiful recording. worth the cost for the title track alone! takako sounds more honest than her former bandmate kahime! her record sounds forced. the sounds on this record are truly inspiring. they make electronics feel organic. there is a lot of feeling here. often kraut and always a pleasure to listen to.
4,Wasting time,"If you have lots of time to waste, this program will take it all. I did not find it friendly at all. I've yet to produced anything even close to the pictures they show in their box ! For under $70 bucks, it has a lot of features which I enjoyed, such as the true 3D modeling feature and the different camera's views. I would consider the output of this software to be more as 'sketches' than as a final presentation. I consider myself an average computer user, so may be it's all my fault, I don't know.I coud not draw a spiral staircase, vaulted ceilings was hopeless, changing the roof peaks and valleys, forget it !A better sofware is beyond my means, so at least I ended up with good 'sketches'.Happy playing !"
5,Excellent Option for Small Group Study,"I lead a women's small group through this book and each chapter had a new insight that touched us deeply. This book is a perfect blend of personal stories and sound theology. The study quide questions at the back of the book helped me prepare for the discussion each week. I highly recommend it-- not just for people going through times of extreme doubt, but for any thinking Christian."
3,seems ok,I bought Breast Actives and received them 3 days ago. I took 2 pills the night I got them and have been taking 1 am and 1 pm. I have used the cream every morning and doing the excersizes with the cream. So far I have noticed that my breast do seem to feel heavier. I gave the rating a 3 due to not taking them but 3 days. I am hoping for some pretty good results but haven't set my expectations real high. My breast do feel somewhat tender buy not unbearable. The first time I took them I got really bad indigestion but when I changed to once in am amd once in pm the indigestion stopped. I stopped caffeine and am eating healthier and excersizing as well. I am going to continue taking them and see what haooens in a couple of months. I say theu are worth the try.
2,No result!!,"I used up the 2 monthes supply.. no results.. didn't feel any soreness of breast at all during the entire time (sign of not working). do not notice any change in breast size or fullness of the breast.. all instactions were FOLLOWED!! HOWEVER, NO RESULTS WHAT SO EVER.. waste of time and money.."
1,Nothing,"It did nothing and the pill tastes disgusting, and too much money. I did this for like 4 or 5 maybe 6 months..? No increase. With the lotion with it."
3,It works but side effects,"Both me and my friend were taking this. I was so happy with the results, even my boyfriend said ""your boobs have been getting bigger"" and he had no idea. But down fall, kidney issues. Both me and my friend started getting strange pain when going to the bathroom, and I got a UTI that wouldn't stop till I stopped taking it. She was having kidney pain all the time. You see results but there maybe some health risks, so is this really worth it ?"
1,?????,"i have been using this product for a month, but it doesnt seem like it's working to me. however, i will keep trying for another one or 2 months. i'll keep u guys updated"
1,Breast Actives,"I don't really recommend this product for everyone.It did not work for me, but maybe it will work for others."
4,Overall worth it,"The product over all worked for me. This was month number four of taking it and I have grown almost a full cup size. To have the product actually work you to follow all the directions though. It says avoid caffeine and to apply cream and take the pills at the same time everyday. You have to be on it for at least 2 months before you will really start to see any results (at least for me). For the most part I have done that. I feel if I would have been more dedicated then I would have better results. However, the last sample I bought I was disappointed in. The bottle of cream was half open and smelled funny and was almost a dark yellowish color. Although I received a bad batch this time I would suggest this product over all as long as you are dedicated or else you won't see the results you want. Also, make sure you eat a decent meal before you take it. If I didn't I would get EXTREMELY nauseous."
5,I remember watching this episode almost 20 years ago...,"Youtube is a really good thing. I was watching some old Honeymooners skits and remembered how powerful Art Carney's performance in this episode was. I watched it a couple of times today and it really touches me today as it did almost twenty years ago, simply wonderful. Christmas is really more than barging up and down dept store aisles. I wonder how many Christmas specials made today would include the dialogue ""and we will thank God for miracles""."
5,"Pecan ""flavor"" smoke is superior for smoking chicken and fish","I've used all the different smoke ""flavors"" of the Bradley Bisquettes in my electric Bradley Smoker. The Pecan Bisquettes are absolutely the best for slow smoking chicken and fish. I got the best price through Amazon.com, which is important for me since I tend to buy in large quantities. I get the best results smoking a ""flattened chicken*"" at 200 degrees for almost 3 hours with the Pecan Bisquettes.* Remove chicken's back bone and press it down so bird is flattened, skin side up, on shelf."
5,"Excellent, Original Covers!","This is the most relaxed I've heard Robert sing for a while. His voice sounds in tip top shape, and he sounds like he really enjoyed these songs. I really enjoyed these songs too, Percy picked a good set list, and his band is good. his guitarists did a really good job (the only way that could have improved was the addition of Mr. Page). This album is not a ""lost Zeppelin album."" I've heard this compared to Led Zeppelin III, but I don't see it. If you have an open mind about it, and don't expect another Zeppelin album, I think You'll like it. I'm looking forward to an album of new Plant material, or better yet, teaming up with Jimmy and JPJ."
2,Not worth the $$$$,"Hmmmm...let's see, 2 good songs and 1 marginal song for [amount]! Not a good deal by any stretch of the imagination. I'm a hard-core RP fan but this latest effort is just plain lifeless & a real chore to listen to. The ""No Quarter"" album of a few years ago was IMHO his best effort since the LZ days. If you want an INCREDIBLE album buy that one instead.Regards,KTR"
3,Re-Review,"When I first got this CD I wrote a bad review of it. But after listening to it for a while more closely It's not that bad. I guess I had heard such great things about it that when I got it my expectations were so high that I was disappointed when it turned out to be just a CD. There are some really outstanding cuts here Darkness Darkness, Another Cup of Coffee and Funny in My Mind to name a few. I'm still not happy with the production and sound quality though. Maybe it's suppose to have that retro feel or Robert in the raw touch? I understand that they have remastered it and improved the sound quality and have added two additional tracks, get that version if you can. Also if you re write your review you cannot change the star rating I would probably give it a 4 or higher now..."
3,So-so,"I was disappointed in this album. I was expecting a lot more and didn't get it. I found it boring and unoriginal. It was adequate, at best."
5,Some great songs,"Even though it's called Souvenirs, it's really a greatest hits album and it's a good one. I'm not a diehard Vince Gill fan, but I like most of the songs on this album. It has many of his hits of the 90's from ""When I Call Your Name"" to ""Tryin' To Get Over You."" It also has a couple of good duos. Even the remake of The Eagles's classic ""I Can't Tell You Why"" is pretty good. There's not hardly any bad songs on this cd.If you're a Vince Gill fan, you'll definitely like this cd. It has most of his early 90's blockbuster hits that made him one of the superstars of country music."
1,Boring,"Title says it all.I'm a geology nut, but I can't stay awake for two pages.Get it from the library before you buy it, and then if you like it, buy it."
2,much smaller than anticipated,"When i tried several times to contact the seller to return it, I got no reply."
3,Got it for one song...,"I don't know much about Bollywood music but a friend suggested I find a song called ""Ina Mina Dika"". It's a great India ""jazz"" type tune.Great for dancing Bal to or a quick swing break out.The rest of the CD, not so much."
3,"Coffee is great... realiability of service, on the other hand...","I first tried this coffee after being unable to drink coffee for years. My stomach cannot handle caffine, and even decaf coffee had an acidity that I could not handle. I was thrilled to learn that there was a tasty alternative that I could purchase online for a reasonable price!My experience with amazon grocery was less than ideal. I ordered this 6-pack, and received only one can in the mail. When I contacted customer service, they assured me that they would complete my order by sending me the remaining 5. Again, I received only one. After contacting customer service again, they refunded my money and told me I could keep the two conainers I had already received.While I appreciate their attempt to make things right, I am extremely reticent to order from amazon grocery again. The prices are great! I just wish I could count on them to deliver what I order."
2,This book leaves something to be desired,I have been reading this book for a class. I must say that this book is not as detailed as I would like it to be. I am an engineer and my expectation was that when a statement is made details would be provided to backup the statements. And the figures in the book are not easy to understand quickly. There must be a better book out there.
3,Good for travelers and those with causal iterest,"Don't be confused by the reviewer who claims that there is no such thing as a Serbo-Croatian language. This miscomception is often spread by nationalists of one side or another. The differences between Serbian and Croatian exist, as they exist between dialects of other languages (such as Italian and German). This guide leans toward the Croatian dialect, which is appropriate as one is more likely to travel in Craotia and one is more likely to be badly received for speaking Serbian in Croatia than vice versa. (In Bosnia it would depend on what part of the country one was in, but people aren't quite as uptight as they once were about using the ""wrong"" word or pronunciation in their particular area).It is especially useful for travelers and those with a general interest in learning the language. Unfortunately, there are very very few materials out there for the serious student of the language spoken in Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia, and Montenegro."
3,More serbian than croatian,"The book is OK for the beginner. The pronunciation is not the best. If you want to go to Croatia buy a different book, Croatian only, this one is more serbian than croatian."
4,Exactly What I Needed.,"I did not want to buy yet another blender, due to a broken blender jar. Amazon is my ""go to"" these days for these sorts of challenges. Found the Oster replacement jar in plastic at a reasonable price, and it was delivered in less than a week. The jar -although not as sturdy as the heavier glass jar- fit fine and does the job."
1,Where has the old Todd gone!,"After listening to ""Songs for the Daily Planet,"" I went out and bought this one. Bad move. All the upbeat energy and humorous charm of the earlier effort has sadly evaporated from this stale, lifeless disc. So, if you're contemplating buying this one, DON'T.Instead, check out Paul Thorn's ""Hammer and Nail."""
1,Horrible record label rip-off release,"I'd give it zero stars if I could. Record labels should be shot for releasing trash like this. This is already available as the Live In 99 DVD. Difference is, Live In 99 is the full show; this is edited down to maybe half of that release AND they resequenced the songs to where they are completely out of order from the way there were performed. Example: George doesn't open with Bad To The Bone on Live In 99 but does here. It looks stupid here because he is already sweaty whereas on Live In 99, he opens with Be Bop Grandma and is dry as a bone. Be Bop Grandma appears about halfway through this release, so for him to start out soaking wet and be dry halfway through the show, it's just so inconsistent as to be stupid. The performance is great, but skip this and get the real deal for maximum enjoyment."
4,One of the Best!,"When I picked up this book in a bookstore, I knew that this would be a worthwhile read. I was not disappointed. Hutchinson's book shows the Harlem Renaissance as it was--the first true experiment in cultural pluralism. From this book, I became one step closer to understanding the Harlem Renaissance. Anyone who is interested in learning more about the greatest artistic movement in American history should read this book!"
3,A fun read,"I am a great fan of Simon Brett and this was a good read. It does not match up to some of his really great books, but is still worth the read."
1,"Wrong item, no customer service.","I purchased this product based on both the picture and the description. The picture that was shown is the exact remote that I needed to replace. That is not the remote which I received. It was advertised as the Dish Network Platinum 8.0 remote, which was the one that I needed. Again, it was not the one which I received. There were receiver model numbers in the description, but I was not near the receiver when I was ordering it and didn't have the model number. The description also said that it should work with any Dish Network UHF receiver and it was advertised as the same remote that I was replacing, so I ordered it. It didn't work. It would not connect to my receiver. I contacted the company requesting assistance, but they never responded. I believe that if you are going to sell a product, it should be as advertised and there should be some degree of customer service, neither of which was existent."
2,No instructions!,This remote is probably fine and would do what I ordered it for if only it would have included some instructions how to program it to work with my receiver. I got the TV programing instructions from a previous reviewer but can find nothing on the receiver and it does not communicate with it as is. Why would something like this come with NO INSTRUCTIONS? Price was fantastic if it worked but as is it is worthless!
1,bottom of the barrel,This is what came by default with our DirecTV installation. These units are slow and cumbersome to operate. The audio outputs on the back are misleadingly labeled. There appears to be no online manual available. The on-screen guide is in a hideous array of colors and can be unreadable on many television screens. The formats and user-friendliness of these units leaves much to be desired.
5,great album,great album i know the band personaly and just saw brian the singer at a burning spear concert and i was with bones the bassist.A must buy for any metal head
2,Surprisingly lacks inspiration,I love Gerda Bengssten and most of her designs and I have several of her books. But this one is just bland and uninspiring for me. I'm happy the other reviewers like it. But I just don't. Judge by the Images on display above.
3,What are we dealing with here? Lets have a look.,"The 3 three stars are for the Narc remix. Very nicely done. Perhaps I like Interpol for different reasons than you, but I really dont recommend this for the price you pay. Not even jail is a good song, however the remix is just the song with a couple of effects thrown on. You may be able to dance to the mix of Public Pervert if you feel so inclined. Buy the black EP before this if you dont have it."
2,A must for language teachers,Chapter 2& 3 provide good guidelines/advice for classroom teachers as well as school administers/educators.
3,Sandpaper grips,The Captains GRIPPER is well made and seems like its very durable. I'd give that part of the GRIPPER five stars. My biggest complaint -- and the reason I'm only giving it 3-stars -- is the machining of the hand grips. It's like grabbing and squeezing sandpaper over and over. I feel like I need to put on gloves before using the GRIPPER. Disappointed with the ergonomics and the need to put on workout gloves every time I use the GRIPPER. Perhaps some sort of foam or rubberized wrap around the grips would have been a better design.
5,Like all COC a great product,Like the title says all of the Captains of Crush from Ironmind another great gripper.
5,Wow!,"These things are no joke! If you make it to no. 2 you're grip will be a force to be recond with. I felt I had pretty good hand strength, not crushing strength, but good. I could do the old plastic with metal spring more time than I could count so I decided on getting no.1 first to see where I stood. Let's just say No.1 humbled me, I am able to get close to a close with them but am no where near being able to use these as a working grip yet. I'm ordering the trainer now since I need to be able to do some warm up sets so I can conquer no.1. My recommendation get the trainer and number 1 unless you have been exclusivley training grip strength for 6mo. or more. You will be suprised by the quality of these and the difficulty. These are 100% worth the money they ask and when you get yours you'll understand why I say that."
1,not calibrated correctly,"Every time I read iron mind they say how precise these grippers are calibrated.I own many of these,and can say they are all different strength and width among the same gripper number.The grippers from the Tetting company are far better quality than coc grippers.In other words if you have two coc grippers of the same model,one will be easier and have different handle width than the other. Buy 2 of the same model captain of crush and see for yourself."
1,crap = cant hold it,"You can not hold it, it so rough that it scratch your hands really hard.do not buy this product"
5,best gripper line you can get,"These guys are great. Anybody serious or just wants to track their progress with hand strength, the captains of crush line is popular for a reason. My hand strength has increased by about 70lbs of pressure in under 3 months, and my forearms look a lot better. I'm naturally skinny (gangly), so having larger forearms really helps in looking a lot more bulky. Captains of crush products are the way to go! I'm hoping to eventually be able to close a level 2!"
5,"Very Good Quality, Tough Gripper","This is a high quality hand gripper, it's a little tougher than I expected, it also requires technique to close it not only strength, I don't recommend buying this one for starters, because even if you can close it, which is difficult you probably would do it 1 or 2 times, so it's not very good to start training grip strength."
4,Effective,Does what you would expect. Don't know about the roughness of the grips some people complain about. I find them to be comfortable. Bought the Guide and I'm moving up.Updated 31MAY2012 - SO... I was dominating the GUIDE model (5 sets of 50 reps each hand for several weeks) and figured I could handle #1. Not so. I can barely do set of 5 even after warmed up. Going to back off to the TRAINER and go from there. Still like the product. High quality construction.
3,Too similar to the #1,"I previously purchased the trainer and #1 Captains of Crush grippers from Iron Mind. The knurling on my #1 is much duller than my trainer and #1.5, that's the first problem.The #1.5 is no more difficult to close than my #1. This is either a defect in my #1 or the #1.5, but either way it was a waste of money for me. I'd send it back but shipping is expensive. I could get a #2 for that price anyways.Summary: Not satisfied with this purchase and I'd suggest just getting the #2 if you can close the #1 a few times."
4,Great service. Very on tome,Great product. I saw it at the W Hotel in Manhatten and I decided to get one. The radio arrived on time. Smooth purchase
1,Looks good but looks don't last.,"I bought my unit to replace a older Sony stand alone. It worked fine for 12 months although the FM reception was a bit disappointing for my 89.3 NPR station. One morning it just......stopped......working. I contacted customer support and they were completely indifferent.It now sits in my garage, a monument to poor quality and lousy customer service. Sure looks good sitting out there though.2/16/09 update. Last July I got tired of looking at it sitting in the garage so I contacted Tivoli and arranged to send my unit in for repair/replacement. For a fee ( I think it was $50.00 but could be wrong) they sent me a new unit that worked pretty well until....you guessed it, the tuner has crapped out on it this weekend. The FM band gives me nothing but static and noise. I wish I could give a -5 star rating for this colossal piece of junk.You have been warned about this company and their crappy radios! Buy at your own risk! I should have listened to myself... :)"
5,Absolutely Excellent for What It Does,"I listen to the radio a lot, and I like to listen to channels that other radios I have had in the past frequently could not pick up well. That problem is nearly a thing of the past now with this Tivoli Model One. I can pick my favorite AM channel at night and during the day I can almost always get a good sound even from a local pirate station. A friend of mine who is a musician visited last week and I had the volume fairly low with some good music on it and he commented what surprisingly good sound was coming out of my radio. I think that wood cover really helps, and I absolutely love the tuner knob. I feel so ""out of control"" with so many digital tuners.I read a lot of the comments here and most people that did not give this radio 5 stars actually gave it rave reviews for what it does and marked it down only for not being what it is not -- a stereo boom box."
3,FM OK AM?,"Fm works fine but the station we listen to is an AM 60 miles away. Does not have good reception even with a Tivoli Audio external AM antenna. My cube bedroom clock radio does much better. Model one very poor AM Band.Ron Johnson Fort Walton Beach, FL."
5,Tivoli Model 1 radio,"Very nice tuning - precise, stable. Good sound for such a small package. A bit pricy unless you can find a discount."
3,Great music. Poor voice,"I was looking for a radio that would look good on my kitchen counter and receive a variety of non-commercial FM radio stations.This radio does both very well. I bought the white/silver color and it looks good in the kitchen. Except for one small FM station, the reception has exceeded my expectations. The music sounds great. It's a little too ""bassy"", but with the volume turned up, the sound from one small single speaker radio is amazing and fills the room with a rich sound. I also like the fact that you can plug in a real antenna.My frustration is when someone is talking on the radio. In addition to music, I like to listen to news (mainly NPR) and sports. There is way too much bass when someone is speaking. As other reviewers have said, it would have been great to have a bass and treble control.So the bottom line for me is great for music and reception, but poor for someone speaking (news, talk radio and sports)."
5,"Very nice, classic style radio","I've had this one for about five years now and have no complaints what so ever. I bought it for my office at work, and used it almost everyday for listening to radio. After retiring I now use it in my home office for radio and for streaming music from myApple iPad 2 MC979LL/A Tablet (16GB, Wifi, White) 2nd Generationvia aLogitech Wireless Speaker Adapter for Bluetooth Audio Devices (980-000540). The Logitech bluetooth adapter just plugs into the Auxiliary port and pairs up.The radio has nice, clean sound and good volume. It is a little bassy, but has a full sound for such a small speaker. I like the form factor, the classic look, and the sturdy feeling controls. It's a beautiful radio for pretty much anywhere in the house or office.Overall, this is a great radio!Highly Recommended!"
3,Can't keep a station in tune,"To be sure, this little radio has great sound. If it's your intention to use it for playback from your iPod, it's a great choice. It's a really nice looking radio and has great sound at all volumes.The only major problem with the radio is the tuner. This is the issue that makes me yell and scream at the radio when I'm trying to listen to the news. It simply cannot keep a station tuned in for more than 30 seconds. I'll dial up an FM station, the light that measures signal strength will be beaming bright, and within a minute, the station is gone. The tuning knob is so sensitive that fine tuning is all but impossible. I'll literally touch the dial (not turn, but touch) and it'll alter the frequency. Buy it for the great sound, but NPR listeners beware... low frequency FM stations just don't stay tuned it."
2,Not so great,"Small, flimsy construction, plus it doesn't have a memory of where you stopped the DVD last time you watched it. Worst of all, you can't fast forward, or do anything without the remote.Works alright otherwise but I wouldn.t buy it again"
3,"No time display, DivX sync issues","I disliked two things about this DVD player. First, the display on the front of the player doesn't show the current time of the DVD. I really missed this feature...I like to glance at the player to see how many minutes I've been watching. Second, although it played DivX files better than the Philips I tried, there were occasional audio-sync issues that do not occur with my Pioneer 400V.Otherwise this player plays DVDs with good quality. Picture and upsampling were good."
5,"Fantastic Writing, Excellent Illustrations","Simply put, this is a children's story at its best. We have been a fan of Heckedy Peg for years. The writing is beautiful as are the illustrations. The repetition of the words and the gorgeous illustrations make for great out loud reading. I myself come from a large family and so have enjoyed the art work of the young children, how they look alike and how they play instead of ""working"" when mother is away. My favorite part is where the Mother repeatedly tells the witch, ""Let me in! I want my children back!"" She does not give up. There is a joyous reunion at the end when she saves the children and chases the bad witch far away never to be seen again. My 6 year old daughter told me after reading it, ""I bet you'd do that for your children, too, mom."" I hope so."
2,Richly shot movie but what is the message or story?,"The exotic shooting locales in this movie are impressive. But trying to tell 3 small stories within one movie crippled the movie in terms of detail. What is the message? Essentially there are 3 sets of people with their own problems (self created issues) and the movie jumps quickly between these 3 stories. There are some great visuals but with a zero storyline there is nothing genius about this movie although some people claim that to be the case.A good movie should make people think and take something back from the time spent watching it. Babel's failure to do so makes this an average film. I think the movie could have made a great travel documentary.Brad Pitt is average, Cate spends most of the time sick/FUBAR after being shot, lots of more unremarkable performances from other actors round off the acting contribution."
1,Babel,Total nonsense I walked out-as did 75% of the audience..DO NOT TAKE THE KIDS!!!! The nudity is totally unnecessary--TOTAL NUDITY-no reason for it!! There is no real story here. Only a Director's political views 1) allow-unrestricted-illegal immigration -no matter what the cost. 2) Gun Control-- The Amendment protecting me from such a mandate outweighs this obvious mis-directed Director.. DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD_EARNED $$$$ on this-no matter who the stars are.. and if this so-called Movie wins ANY award- I consider any awards show -TOTALLY- Political. My grade is underground a -5 A concerned AMERICAN Citizen
2,Please Shoot Me As Well,"Very dissapointed, the story of the Japanese family adds dirt on top of a dead movie. If it wins for Best Picture then Scorecese should shoot himself. If you are having a hard time sleeping watch this. You will be a sleep in no time."
2,On Tivo: Not the widescreen version!,"Was very disappointed to realize that on my Tivo (series 3, but I don't think it matters) I got the 4:3 version. NOT the widescreen version.So of course it displays ""windowboxed"" instead of full screen. Yeah, i can ZOOM the tv display but this degrades even further the image quality. Not very pretty in the end.Is this going to be the case for all Tivo downloads?"
1,dont waste two hours of your life,movie has no point and doesnt really even end. plus all of the events that take place are unrealistic. dumb movie
5,Babel,"This movie like ""crash"" will take the viewer through a number of actor's lives and how they all at first seem to be different will tie in for a wonderful and un expected ending."
1,Watch this to be depressed and waste your life.,The movie was awful and depressing with no redemption. I actually like melancholy movies but this was just depressing. Basically take ordinary situations in life and think of the worst thing that could happen and add it to the situation. There is no reason to watch this movie unless you want to see an anti-western vibe of how the West mistreats those who are less fortunate. The worst movie I have seen in a long time and a waste of my life.
1,Most overhyped movie in history!!!,I am not highly critical of movies. I actually watch plenty of movies and enjoy pretty much all genres. This movie is a classic example of an overhyped movie with a good cast that was exremely overrated. The fact that this movie was nominated for an oscar makes the academy look bad.Babel is almost worse than Mars Attacks!
3,A modern interrelation of events,"Taking place in four places at once we have a Moroccan Arab scene, an American Mexican scene, a Japanese scene and the main scene.The acting of the Japanese scene seems best, but the Moroccan boys are good.Cate Blanchett gets a hard role of just being hurt.For my money it is a badly done movie with police brutality by American and Moroccans. Children with rifles who aren't trained properly in their danger and use is actually important: most parents should see this."
1,"well made film, depressing, pointless movie","If you're into the emotions you experience watching footage of suicide bombers blowing up people, you will enjoy this movie. If I had been alone, I would have left. It almost made me angry watching it because I saw no point in making a movie like this. Is wasn't ""Crash"", although perhaps it was meant to be. I really disliked it and gave it one star because the production was so professional. If you want to see an award nominated movie try ""Liitle Miss Sunshine"", instead. At least you'll feel good when you leave."
1,CONFUSING,"This was the most confusing crock that I have watched in a long time. Already about an hour too long, I had to keep rewinding segments because I thought that I missed something. But I didn't miss anything - the producers and director did - they missed what makes a really good movie. The subject matter is confusing enough without trying to interweave a ""Crash""-type scenario across continents and cultures. I'm still trying to figure out how the Mexican nanny fits in and she was the most sympathetic character. The Japanese segment could have been left out altogether - deaf students, weapons, detectives, discos - just too much to digest, with no sake to wash it down with. Leave this one alone and watch ""Happy Feet"" - fast moving penguins make more sense with their flippers than this movie does!"
2,Bordering on Child Pornography,"Babel is difficult to watch but thought-provoking. The acting is superb. But I was really disturbed by the exploitation of the children in this film. Did I need to see a 12-year-old boy peeping at his naked sister and then maturbating? What does that add to the plot? The deaf-mute Japanese girl--I don't know how old she really is or if she really is deaf, but the film puts her at about 16. The endless crotch-shots and then the full frontal nudity shocked me--I really felt she was being exploited. The ending, where her father finds her on the balcony, nude, and takes her hand, left my husband wondering if this was supposed to suggest some sort of incestual relationship. Although I don't agree, dad definitely did not seem surprised to find her out there unclothed. If adults want to do these types of scenes, fine. But having children do them pushes the envelope on kiddie porn and left me feeling dirty after watching this film."
1,Been waiting 36 years for this,"36 years ago I saw a movie so bad that I've waited all this time for something to top it. Congratulations, Babel. A meaningless disco scene does on for 20 minutes with the sound going silent again and again and yet again to make sure for the millionth time that you identify with the deaf protagonist. Every US border agent is portrayed as an inhumane bumpkin. While Kate Blanchett's character is bleeding to death in a Morrocan village for days because the US embassy can't find a medivac, we cut back to the Mexican border to see helicopters on border patrol. I guess we're supposed to be subliminally moved about this ""waste"". A japanese businessman starts the ongoing tragedy half a world away by giving a friend a rifle. When Blanchett is finally evacuated, the theadbare village won't take the money repeatedly offered in thanks. If it was only preachy claptrap, hamhandedly presented, it wouldn't be unique. But the agonizingly slow pace makes it completely unbearable."
1,Very Slow,This movie was very slow and seemed to have no real plot. Unrelated people have an effect on each other and America makes anything terrorism. That is the message they seem to be trying to send.
3,"Melodramatic, Manipulative, Cliched, and Swiss Cheesy","Like watching a Mexican telenovela, only not as interesting. (And I don't speak Spanish!)Riddled with stereotypes! For example, what Mexican wedding would be complete without a liquored up Mexican shooting a gun in the air? And don't forget the chicken with its head cut off.Does Brad Pitt hate Mexico? In his earlier movie, The Mexican, there were burros at the Mexico City airport! Ever been to the airport in Mexico City? It makes LaGuardia look like it services provincial rubes.And what Moroccan prepubescent boy doesn't masturbate thinking of his naked sister? Good grief. Is this what elites really think of the so-called ""third world""?And how many times does the film have to go silent so that we know what the deaf Japanese girl with hot pants experiences?"
4,Well enough,"Great acting. The deaf Japanese girl story was the most interesting. Brad Pitt did a great job, but his character was ridiculous. What made him think that a bus full of westerners would wait overnight in Morocco? And if those folks were so scarred to be out in the middle of Morocco, why are they on that tour that takes them to the middle of nowhere Morocco? And in all that time, why didn't they take the damn bus right to the hospital? Silly really.Too much like Traffic and Crash to be original enough for me. Still pretty interesting."
2,"Poorly written, good camera work.","This could have been a great film, but I can't recommend the final product. The screen play was bad, or maybe it's the editing. The whole package does not come together.I did like some of the outstanding camera shots, you can skip forward to find the good ones."
4,3.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:I still don't think that the Japanese plotline fits in with the rest of the film, but Babel is a consistently-engaging and thought-provoking drama which manages to be different without being pretentious and multicultural without being obvious."
2,Overrated,"This movie was plodding and I had to force myself to get through it, hoping for the payoff at the end where everything fell into place. It didn't. Good acting, but not worth the time."
2,what did we miss,"We bought our DVD in India so I have to wonder what was censored out, definitely something at the end with the Japanese girl. Anyway, I sooooo want to see Brad Pitt do a stellar acting job in a film. And I'm still waiting after this film. I found he'd be more believable if he'd just look straight into the camera & say 'Look, I'm a liberal idiot like most successful actors & want to decrease my guilt by standing for just causes & promote a socialist society. However, I'm a geek in person, just a useless BonoWannabe, so I'll go for roles like this that force feed the socialist agenda & I'll get the role because I have a pinch of acting ability but a handful of eye-candy.' What was I saying? What was my point? Oh I dunno, maybe he's awful...AGAIN...Blanchett's role was too short, the Mexican lady was great, the Japanese vignette was very clever but in whole, the story pushes the point down your throat, no subtlety, no leaving the viewer to think, just telling you what you should think."
1,"Rent it, don't buy it, and then fast forward.","I consider myself fairly open when it comes to unique, or even delayed plot structure, except here. I must admit, the best parts of this movie were in the trailer. This movie made no sense, and the only possible reference to Babel was that you could understand no one. I fast forwarded through 1/2 of the 2.5 hour movie, and didn't miss a thing. If you must watch it, rent it and don't think it's worth keeping for an extra day based on the trailer, it won't be."
2,!!!!!!!!!!BORING!!!!!!!!!!,Don't even waste your time. How this movie isup for so many awards I will never know. I went and saw it with some friends of mine and then best part of the movie was when we got to leave. There was not even one small part of this movie that could save it. I was very disapointed; I really wanted to like this movie but could not do it. I buy every movie I see when it comes out on DVD and I am going to skip this one. If you must see it make sure you rent and do not buy.
3,"Superbly acted, beautifully executed...","Superbly acted, beautifully executed stinker of a film. It's got some really good messages. Unfortunately they get buried. We had no idea it was supposed to be about ""communication"" until I read the amazon synopsis.It almost seemed like a poor attempt to imitate ""CRASH"" which was awesome.But ""BABEL"" had a lousy ending, no ending?, and the message was muddy at best.Cate Blanchett was supremely magnificent as Susan Jones. Brad Pitt gives the best (and most emotional) performance of his career. The acting was wonderful. The filmwork was great. The direction was great.But overall, the movie was kind of a disappointment unfortunately.Again, the individual stories were very good. The whole Japanese storyline could have been shortened or left out. The actress was boring. Just because she's naked, doesn't make her performance compelling."
4,haha... someone said crash with a transport...,"I agree, except I think that this movie did what 'crash' was trying to do. Without puting a Christian bias in it and thus negating the entire meaning of the film, (as crash did quite thoroughly) Babel tied its stories together in a way that I believe was intended to have one question his responsibility in 'all' matters, even (or especially) matters that are seemingly out of our control. At the same time, the stories are different enough to make one see something that is quite clear in multiple perspectives. If you watch it and you think, ""I get it,"" you probably do, and if you still think it sucks, that's fine, but at least, when you derrive upon an issue that you think you understand, doubt yourself and try to get a little more out of it than you are used to. ""Where there is doubt there is freedom"" ~Latin Proverb."
5,"It feels so real, such a great flick, one of the tops in 2006...","Wow, that's all I can say. This film was great. Despite it's mixed bag of reviews, I can honestly say this is a film that I could not turn away from. The actors/actresses felt as if they were next door neighbors, or people that you had known for some time. The first time I watched a film like this (where the storyline seems to bounce all over from start to finish) I'll admit, I wasn't a fan. The more it is used (which seems to be quite a bit more now) the more it grows on me. You just have to watch this film. So many emotional performances. Give it a shot. You won't be disappointed."
2,Huh?,"First of all, of all the places to vacation after the death of a child, why would Brad and Kate choose the desert around Morocco? I didn't get that part at all. I guess it was as desolate as their lives?? This film was very slow and unsatisfying. Seems like America took some hits via border agents and news accounts of terroism.The mood was very tense, which did keep my attention. I'm glad it wasn't any longer."
2,Sophisticated...too sophisticated!,"Too much...too much sophistication accurately describes this film. I realize not being able to understand the foreign languages was the crux of the film, but come on! At first, I thought the DVD was defective because I couldn't produce the sub-titles. When I finally realized I was mistaken, not only was I frustrated, I also felt stupid. Yes the performances were on target, especially the nanny character played by Adrianna Barraza. And the child actors were great! The reason I gave this film two stars is because of the effort needed on behalf of the viewer to enjoy this film. If it's a documentary, then make it a documentary; if not, put us (the audience) in a position to both enjoy and understand the plot instead of clubbing us in the head with our inabilities and insecurities. I'm not saying don't see it; however, I am saying be emotionally forewarned."
4,It's all in the symbolism,"I really liked this movie; to me the stark contrast of the Muslim way of live verses that of the west and the typical subtle prejudices that people have is what makes this movie interesting. Before the interlinking of the stories were revealed I noticed myself assuming things about characters that had yet to be revealed, and once they were is brought to life to me the phrase ""there are always two sides to every story"" if you don't like analyzing movies than this is probably not for you. However, if you are interested in learning how you may judge or how you may assume things about other people who are different to you than this is a movie for you."
2,Go elsewhere for the very best,"This was mediocre and disappointing as a ""very best of"" album. It was appealing before buying it in its array of song selections, but it turned out to have some of the otherwise best songs as live versions. If I had known that the sound quality was so low on these tracks, I never would have dreamed of buying this. JTQ is obviously not a good live band sound-wise in my opinion, or at least with the equipment used to record these live tracks. I also kind of forgot how much they overemphasize the organ/keyboard sound, which is too much even on their best songs really. In general they just don't compare to the other albums I bought at the same time, such as authentic original lounge acts, so maybe it wasn't fair to rate them at all. Still this is just not a good selection of songs considering the ultra-lame live tracks and mediocre studio ones."
4,Works great.,I use for baseball. It works great for fielding drills. Easy to set up. I have had it for almost two seasons and it holds up well. It is not as fast as those pop up nets but it holds it shape better.
5,"Easy Set-up, Easy Take Down!","My son made our local HS team, but as an 8th grader he was not getting a lot of BP during practice. I needed something for some quick soft toss every night after practice. This one does the job! Sturdy, great quality and stores away fast! I've owned other brands, but this one is the best, hands down!"
3,"Scratched, no replacements to offer.","I love the radio, however Amazon sent me a radio that has a scratch on the face, which looks like it was buffed and now is more shiny than the rest of the face of the radio. Sound quality is great, but it doesn't look brand new. They also had no replacements in stock. :("
5,Fantastic Product!,I was amazingly surprised at the sound quality this unit produces. I purchased this for our formal living area for both it's looks and sound and both are quality. Because of the speaker size these speakers are quite punchy while not losing the high end of the spectrum either. All in all they make for a great setup.
4,A fresh new perspective of race and multiculturalism,"Is pluralism the most progressive standpoint or does progressive pluralism hold only slightly less racism than conservatism? Malik challenges the decades-old notion that pluralism is the best option for minorities, which most of us have taken for granted since the 70's. I must say that his compelling arguments have had an enormous impact on my political views and changed my perspective on many issues.My only issue with this book is that he goes into ridiculous amounts of mundane detail. If you have the patience to wade through those details, there are all kinds of interesting new perspectives to find."
5,Charming and Fun Way to Experience French and France,"Whether you know a little French, a lot, or none at all, you will love these descriptions, musings and tiny lessons about everyday living in the south of France. Written by an American woman who has fallen in love with that country (as well as with a Frenchman tres charmant), this book is fun way to learn some French and experience the culture, whether you skip through it or curl up with it, preferably with a coffee and croissant in hand."
4,Great if you love the French language,I am enjoying this book and all the little stories she tells about each word. French is such an interesting language. I will never be able to speak with such flair.
3,Better blog than book.,The book was really a series of blogs published on paper. The actual blog is much more interesting because of the photos she includes on her blog. I recommend that next time she publishes her blog that she include the photos.I do not recommend this book for a bookclub because there is no meat to it. It is light summer fare. Very easy to read in snippets.
2,Good but boring,"The exersise is good, but it is not inspiring to keep on. Mindy knows what she is doing, but for me I need a little more. It's boring."
3,Spin class in Santa Cruz!,"This is our fourth spin DVD.. It's good. I like the bike around Santa Cruz, since I live here. You make the class as hard as you want to. Mindy is a pro when it comes to working out.I would refer this DVD to friends. It's different and it pushes you.Spin away!"
3,It's a Start!,"I bought Great Divide after Feeling Strangely Fine, mainly because I LOVE the way Dan Wilson croons. The first is much simpler and I haven't really decided whether I like it or not. FNT is definately catchy and a good song. As for the others, they all sound the same to me. Perhaps I need to listen to the album some more!!!"
1,ecch,"You remember that episode of ""Futurama"" where Leela sang that stupid ""Whalers On The Moon"" song?Now imagine that played 12 times."
4,I have been using Western Filament lines for over 20 years.,Still lot of people think it will cut mono. I showed demos a lot of times to fellow fishermen actually mono can cut the spectra too.If you get 50LB Bluefin on the line it doesn't matter what kind of lines are tangled. Always that guy's line wins.I give 4 stars because of the price and the wax.I still use the first line I bought years ago. I just need more lines because of new reel. Usually I pull out the spectra from the spool because I only use WF.
1,Never Got this Toy!,"All my 3 year old son wanted for Christmas was a blue camaro, I was so excited to find this one, but to his and my dismay it nevera rrived. i ran out on Christmas eve to find one but all I could come up with was a red camaro, it was f ine but he is still asking about his blue camaro, what a bummer...very disappointed in Amazon.com!"
3,Good movie,This is not a documentary or biography. The movie was shot beautifully and the actors are terrific but the dialogue and script were created for entertainment purposes not reality. I was disappointed with portions of the dialogue. Nevertheless it turns out to be a good movie.
5,Very nicely done!,"Well acted, mostly accurate, and a joy to watch! A great depiction of the man who saved the free world."
5,The movie that helped me discover Barbara,No not the overblown Barbara Streisand. But Barbara Stanwyck. I love her. She is a great actress. Has everyone known this but me? I had always heard of Bette David and others. But never Stanwyck. But after seeing this movie I looked her work. And saw others like John Doe and Double Indemnity and even Big Valley and The Thorn Birds. Loved her in all. She is a great American treasure that should be lauded as such more often and regularly. This movie was great . . . what a view of NYC in those days. Amazing.
5,Fabulous!!!!!!,"Thank you for writing this fabulous 1st novel. I didn't expected to read ""my"" story in the portrait of several characters. How did you know? No matter your level of growth in God, the fact still remains that issues of infidelity, domestic abuse, depression, etc., must be dealt with. Many can benefit from ""Somtimes I Cry""'s healing, deliverance and restoration properties, that I recommended it to others (they loved it also; WOW). I would even recommend book clubs to choose this as a pic-of-the-month (are you reading this Oprah). You captured my attention from page 1 and kept it until the end. Sister, continue to let the Lord use you in this gift.~Signed~ Eagerly awaiting next effort"
3,Commendable first time effort!,"I liked Dominques writing style and really enjoyed reading the book. As a christian writer myself, I know how difficult it is to bring forward strong biblical truth in fiction - Dominique made a good first time effort. I know her next book is going to be even better and I am looking forward to that!"
4,A Good Read!!,"Grosvenor tackled the innermost emotions of what it feels like to be the other woman. This novel was able to evoke a constant nagging of emotion from its reader. It conjured up everyday thoughts that one may question even when not caught up in such a situation. One thing is certain in this novel, and that is it tackled what we all truly search for in life...""loving someone and someone to love you back""."
2,Not what we expected,"We received this today and it turns out it's 60% cotton, 40% poly. We are sending back."
3,Beginning background music gone?,"I wanted to buy this album for the music played at the beginning as background music but it wasn't there so I didn't. Missing is ""Moonglow and Theme From Picnic"" performed by Morris Stoloff. This was from the soundtrack of ""Picnic"" and I was hoping to find it on CD. All I have is the vinyl record."
4,Le Mépris Jean Luc Godard Georges Delerue,"maybe not the moment to talk about a french music composer - who's dead anyway - yet Casino has been on pbs tonite again and the Theme of Camille has been employed at least a couple of times, in the desert and towards the end credits; the music was written for this early 6oies movie by suiss director Godard and is part of national memory in France, Piccoli and Bardot starring as well as Fritz Lang; Delerue only wrote a few pieces for this movie that cab be found entirely on technically pretty perfect reissues; I didn't remember until I've seen the movie tonite again."
4,Like it a lot...,"I like this mask a lot. I wanted something a little less drying than my purifying mint mask and since this has avocado in it I thought it would be a nice alternative. It's very nice and applies easily and my skin feels softer after I use it without feeling like it's stripped me of all moisture. Don't get me wrong, it's not the same effect as using a moisturizer or anything - you're still going to lose some moisture - but it's not nearly as drying as some masks I've used before."
4,My sister in law loved this cake pan,"I go this for my sister in law who is a baker. She had been looking for something like this forever, and I fnally found it for her on amazon. She loves it."
3,Not as described,"BEWARE!!! I have bought this item from 2 different sellers and even though the description states it is a 6 pack, they do NOT ship 6 in a pack! Both sellers issued refunds and took care of the issue."
2,"Boring - emphasizes units formed, equipment etc","I've only made it through WW II - the book is not very interesting. Mostly he seems to care about Order of Battle for night flying units - the unit names, what equipment they had, who the leaders were. He summarizes how many planes they shot down. But there is very little about the technology of night flying, what problems came up and how they were solved, and what they DID every night. I've read some autobiographies of night flyers which were much more interesting.Every person who reads a book like this probably has different goals. Mine were to find out what it was like to fly at night, what made it hard, how it gradually got easier. Maybe the last half of the book has such information, but I stopped before I got there."
4,LOCAL ALBUM REVIEW,"The Amazing Grace Sacred Strings Praise Band has delivered a true musical accomplishment that is a masterful as it is innovative. I love the concept behind this album...If you want to gain appreciation for a new sound, if you want to break a sweat or even if you just love supporting Toledo-based artists in their pursuits... go purchase this album. Doing something different and doing it well is always a Glorious Triumph!"
4,Recommended for students and architects alike.,Informative treatment of the subject with interesting anecdotes from some of the architects and clients. This is a good one to help expand your client's minds.
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,"Based on Amazon's editorial and reader reviews, I was expecting ""We Are All Fine Here"" to be more moving and incisive. Instead, I found it predictable and bland. The Ray character was such a cliche (physically and psychologically) that I couldn't buy it, and the story was populated by other stock characters (the needy, needling mother; the eccentric chum) that we've seen a million times. I agree that some of the flawed heroine's private thoughts and wry observations can spark moments of sharp recognition for readers, but for those who prefer narratives wrapped in dark, wisecracking prose, I recommend Lorrie Moore, who has a real gift for this art form."
4,A Fun Read,"I picked up this book solely on the title and cover (yes you CAN judge a book by it's cover.) It was a quick, fun, witty read that brought me to tears. I highly recommend this torrid love triangle! I hope she writes again!!"
2,Worst. Toy. Design. Ever.,"Love the figure in and of itself but the sticks don't fit (or stay) in the base well and fell out more times than I can count on the way to the shelf. The worst part however was that Kate's feet did not match up with the holes in the base!! You would think for what McFarlane toys cost they could learn to put the holes in the correct places, Rubbish. 2 stars is generous."
3,Quality Figuirine,"This is a great figuirine of Kate. Only two complaints: Kate's feet don't easily go onto the base stand. Also, the bamboo she is standing in has the same problem; it's hard to put them all in as shown in the display photos."
2,Bleh? eh?,"Am I the only one who found the story line off-kilter? It had such a weak plot that I wonder why they even bothered. Charmaine was hiding from the mob from Bucks R US and Rusty was supposed to protect her. First off, the ""scary"" people from Bucks R US were practically nonexistent. There was totally no interaction between them and Charmaine. Just some half-a**ed explanation about why she was in trouble and some vague references throughout the book.When they mentioned Charmaine and Rusty's story in Red Hot Cajun, I really thought that it was going to be the best out of them for sure. I'm starting to find Tante LuLu really annoying. Mind her own business I say, she pushes it too far at times and they let her!Another half-a**ed plot was the reason behing Charmaine and Rusty's separation. How vague can you be?It was an okay read. If you want fluff to read then this is it."
2,Doesnt' last...,"Like other reviewers have said, this plane only lasted us 1 day. The body of the plane is foam, so after being loaded 100 times or so, it rips. Thankfully, I got this during the Christmas sale at Amazon, and only paid $3.50 for it. It was definately worth the $3.50, but I'd be complaining if I paid full price for it."
5,Great,This is great. I have always wanted Biba's books. Now I can help my wife shop and cook some of these receipes. Thanks!!
4,What a voice! Bravo!,"When I first heard Mr. Calleja on my NPR station a few months ago, I knew immediately that this was a really gifted tenor....he sounded like Pavarotti as a very young man, so his potential was limitless.Highly recommend you 'try him out', either on this CD or another."
3,Great peel-off mask,This is a very good peel-off mask. I was hoping for something to get black heads a little better but this was still very good cleaning the skin.
1,It's not what it says-be careful!,"I recently ordered this product. When it arrived, I searched for the ingredients and found out there are no gingseng nor melon ingredients. It's only cucumber. Apparently the name of the product is misleading.I called the customer service, who admitted that the name of the product should have had been changed and promised to make the change. Yet until now the name has not been changed. So make sure you are really after a cucumber peel-off mask not with Gingseng nor melon."
2,Not really good,"- It peel off nothing. I don't have blackhead but just a little dead skin around my chin. And dead skin is even easier to peel off than blackhead, but this thing can't even take it out. Disappointed."
4,Channel your inner Patrick Bateman,"Sans the axed bodies in the closet and stuff. That aside, this product works great. Peel away a new you. And the guilt from the high velocity blood spatter that you got on your cheekbone from yesterday evening..."
5,love it!,"I love this facial peel-off mask, it has a refreshing smell and leaves my face super soft!I highly recommend this product."
2,Gain squeaky ball dog toy,Ethical 5 inch gaint squeaky dog toy is a great toy for large dog. A good product that would last for a dog.
2,Dumb,Silly purchase and wasted money because I was bored. Maybe for someone that likes romance novels and not biographies and such.
2,Sometimes you can't trust the reviews.,"I'm sure this was nice 15 years ago, but now it is so outdated it looks comical. Or maybe it's just me."
5,If you curl your lashes this is the mascara for you!!!,"I'm lost for words...I can't say enough about Loreal's Featherlash Waterproof mascara in black..if you curl your lashes...look no further. Thanks to it's waterproof properties this mascara will not uncurl your lashes, it wont smear, clump up or flake off at all..it stays on and if you have few lashes this will make your lashes full and lengthy...just make sure you apply once, let it dry for one minute then apply second coat, wait one more minute and apply third coat...and you'll see the magic. One thing is it won't wash off easily with soap and water as it is waterproof... but if you use an oil base eye-makeup remover like Lancome's Bifacil it will come off very easily. I love this product and would recommend to anyone."
2,Dried Out Disappointment,"The fact that these were unsulphured was the biggest selling point and the price seemed fair. Four individual bags inside a sturdy box, but each bag contains very dry raisins stuck together in large clumps. This product is not up to Bob's Red Mill quality and we will be glad when the four bags are finished and we can purchase a different brand."
3,If this was the one I had ordered...,"...then, I would consider it a fairly decent product, but it didn't serve the purpose. The product pictured on the Amazon site wasn't the product we received. The one we thought we were ordering was all black and didn't have a door/gate. The one we received, was a hammered silver color and, yes, had a door/gate. While these may be nice features to some, they weren't what we wanted...so we sent it back and bought a different one."
3,what happened?,"is this the same band that brought us ""runaway"", ""god is a girl"", ""the end"" and ""poison""?????i was torn about reviewing this album. It is a great album for the type of music that it is. BUT...it is a very mediocore album by Groove Coverage standards. For me, there are no standout tracks here besides the singles, ""on the rado"" and ""holy virgin"". on their first two albums there were even some excellent ballads. but the slow tempo songs on here are filler.I'm really dissapointed."
5,BADAS$ Hammer,all i can say is AWESOMEworks just like they say drives hard as a larger hammerthe side nail puller is a must if you work with 16d duplex
3,Positives and Negatives,"Positives:* This book moves really fast even though it's a bit long.* The family that she moves in with is hilarious. It reminds me of the stories about hippies.* She really grows up and you see that there is always a second chance.Negatives:* She never really understands her parents point of view. It's like they don't matter.* The decisions are laid out for her.* It's unknown if she really learns what she is supposed to, or if it's just things that she finds interesting. If we didn't have to learn everything then I would have never learned any math."
2,Pedantic Effort,"As an avid golfer and golf fan, I had hoped for more. The story lacks imagination. While the story is fairly well written, the story line is very predictable. The use of ""golf facts and terms"" does not offset the lack of suspense or the naging question about the reality of the possibility of the base events occuring on the PGA Tour."
2,Not too good,"The Barenaked Ladies aren't an awful group, but they aren't a good group either. Every once in a while they come up with a good song, like pinch me. But even those songs get boring after a while. If you like their previous work, then you should buy it. If you haven't bought any of their cds i would be cautious before buying it. You may like it at first, but after a month or so, you will probably be sick of it."
5,great catchy pop rock,"Not a big fan of BNL's early stuff, but they had a few good songs. Thought Stunt was great though, and a week of listening to this album convinced me that it was better. Lots of catchy, simple, hooks with occassionally clever lyrics, and one painful groaner: ...Roman Polanski/if he was only given the chance-ski.Don't know that I'd want to hear an entire album of Kevin's singing, but it works great on the hidden track. Wish Ed had more vocals.Never Do Anything, Pinch Me, Humour of the Situation, and Hidden Sun are standouts. There really aren't any songs I have to skip over."
4,It was good...not great,"The long awaited follow up to the smash hit Stunt falls a little short of its predessor. There are not too many radio friendly tracks here. Which may not be a bad thing. This album shows the bands talents without them having to give us songs that will someday be hit singles. There is a strong pop feel on this album, with a feeling that it is not as fun as their other albums. It does have stand out tracks, but there is not a hit like One Week to pull in all of the people who are not true fans. The album does display talent, and a feeling that the band is starting to grow up and go a little away from their roots."
3,high hopes,"i have been waiting for a chance to either get a cd version of her self-titled first cd that came out in the late 1980's, but i recently found out that it is sadly unavailable(for me, it's the best dance cd ever!...and i have hundreds!...)to see a remix of some of her older material is very exciting!... ""don't break my heart remix is not as wonderful as i had hoped, but the remix of ""love is on her mind is very,very cool, and gives me a lot of hope for her forthcoming greatest hits cd in august!...i can't wait to have it!... good-luck safire!..."
2,Sa-fire Don't Break My Heart CD single review...,"There are 9 tracks on this CD, and none of them had the remix I was looking for. I have the Wild Workout at Noon Vol.1 CD, and it has Don't Break My Heart on it, but I wanted a version that didn't have the Wild Workout title said over the beginning and end of the song. This sure didn't have it. Sounded a lot different. I guess that's what you get with a blind buy. I bought from Doolicity and they sure shipped it out quick. Good service, not what I was expecting on the CD though.Tracks:--1. Tony Moran's ""2002 Anthem Mix"" 11:36----2. Kenny Diaz ""Booty Shaker Mix"" 4:10----3. Tribal Mix 8:35----4. Dub 11:35----5. 12"" Mix Show Edit 4:50----6. (well, it's on the CD, but doesn't list it on the back for some reason)----7. 7"" Radio Edit 3:55----8. Tribal Instrumental 8:38----9. Love In On Her Mind ""Transatlantic Mix"" 6:00--"
2,Buyer Beware,"Let me tell you why I would never buy this printer again... Granted, I'm a novice at using photo printers, but I'm also a technical specialist and not totally naive when it comes to technology. I bought the printer wanting to reproduce photo-quality 4x6 pictures. Those I printed using the 5 sample sheets that were included with the printer were of excellent quality! The catch is, even though they say the printer is compatible with other papers, they don't tell you how to make that happen. I've tried two other paper types so far, and because they're all perforated slightly different than the Canon paper, they print off-center. No instructions are included on how to configure the printer to accept any other type of paper. And guess what... it's nearly impossible to find 4x6 canon paper at retail stores. You can get it on the Canon website if you feel like paying a steep price for shipping AND tax. What a scam. I'd keep looking if I were you..."
4,Very happy with printer...,"Like most here, I am also very happy with my Canon 630. My biggest problem was printing photographs on non standard size paper. I am sure this was Operator Error, and the problem was more with the Canon Software that came with my Digital Camera, but I thought the photo quality was outstanding."
2,hp c platinum calculator a bust,"I have had both the hp c platinum and hp c financial calculator only to say that the hp c platinum calculator has more problems. So do not get fooled when you hear that the hp c platinum financial calculator has a longer battery life because it doesn't. My hp financial calculator was stolen after using it for a minimal of four years with out having any problems or battery replacements. After I lost my hp c financial calculator, I decided to buy the hp c platinum calculator because it was marketed to have a better battery life. However, the battery life was much worse and the calculator died within three years. Not only did the battery die, but the calculator does not work properly after replacing the battery, so be careful and buy the cheaper better running hp c financial calculator."
1,"Unreliable, missed key entries, miscalculates, very poor quality","I own six HP12Cs and just purchased three more for MBA grad school. These new ones are of such poor quality that they are unreliable. I turned one back into HP for refund that missed key entries at least 10% of the time. I literally smashed one today because it would calculate different answers each time for the same inputs (NPV problems), missed key entries, and had to be turned on sometimes 3 and 4 times before turning on. I tried to talk to HP about their quality, but they were not interested. Even my professors at the university do not recommend HP calculators any longer. That is too bad, because the RPN is so natural to use. I must say though, my older HP12Cs from the 1980s still work but albeit slowly compared to the new ones."
3,Forced to buy.,"if it is not for CFA exam, I will not buy it at all. I don't recommend it just for normal use."
4,early review,"It's very early to review the above item, but it was received in less time than I expected and in good shape. So far I've had no problems with it. I thought this would be a good companion to the HP 11, which I've had for more than 20 years, and it works like the day I bought it. Hopefully the HP 12C will serve me as well."
4,Old Habits Die Hard,"Quality isn't what it used to be, but old habits do die hard. If you can't function in an algebraic mode, this is still the RPN calculator for you. Much faster than my now dead Gold 12c too."
4,Very good instrument,"Recently purchased the HP12 C platinum financial calculator. Firstly, the price on Amazon is about 20% cheaper than what I found in Staples. Secondly, it takes a fair amount of time to read the manual & get to know the calculator. But once you get the hang of it, it is a fabulous instrument. I would definitely recommend this for all finance professionals."
4,12CP vs. 12C display,"The 12cp seems to perform about equally with my previous 12C, but there is a huge downgrade in the quality of the display. The 12CP display has thinner characters with less visibility in poor light, and most importantly they lose contrast at even a slight viewing angle as compared to a direct 90 degree observation (important when not directly over the calculator, such as on a desktop). The 12C had a very robust display with great visibility at an angle."
4,Very good but should improve some functions,"I suggest that HP includes in 12c models the 'undo' function similar to 48G series. So, we can cancel the operation made by mistake. I thought it was in 12c 25th anniversary, but in vain..."
1,Typos and formatting make this almost impossible to read,"I am sorry to base my review on the formatting, but I feel that it is such a distraction that other readers should know what they are getting. In addition to the multiple typos mentioned in another review, there are multiple instances of run on sentences and whole paragraphs thatarewrittenlikethismakingitverydifficulttofigureoutwhattheauthorintendsforyoutoread. These errors are also present in the preview, but I had hoped the actual book content would be corrected. This is a shame, because I have wanted to read this book since I became aware of it back in the 70's. I made it through 10 chapters before I decided it was too much of a chore and returned the content for a refund. If Amazon can correct the formatting mistakes, I would buy the book again, because I would still love to read it. Sorry, Hammer Fans, but we should not have to settle for this."

5,"Way Better then any ""He Loves U Not"" Remixes!","This is a CD single for Dream's second single ""This Is Me"". If you are looking for the original ""This Is Me"" you won't find it on this CD, this CD only has two remixes, but they are very powerful!1) Remix [Featuring Kain] ~ The lyrics are all different, even the chorus. You will love this remix, don't worry for all of you who don't like rap, there isn't really any in this song ^-^ (even though it might of help a little if there was no rap...). The only thing Kain does is say stuff like ""Bad Boy Records"" ""Dream"" and the names of the girls at the begining on the song and then he gets a couple of lines. Fans of R and B will love this, this isn't pop at the least.2) Mike Rizzo's Hyper Mix ~ I love this remix! The Lyrics and chorus are true to the original, but this is a dance remix. It starts off with a soft tone, then breaks out into dance mode ^-^. A wonderful dance remix, will get you moving."
4,Great Pilates/Yoga toning w/relaxed instructor,"This is the 3rd & most advanced in the Yogilates series. Jonathan Urla is relaxing as always, but challenges you & kick your butt in this workout. It's over 70 min. of work with a short guided meditation at the end.The only thing I didn't care for was some of the music, it seemed too elevator style for me, but I loved the choice for the meditation best. (I tend to like Enigma style for relaxing.)There are way too many poses/exercises to list (all thee popular ones of both styles) & many poses flowed with each other & Jonathan has good body awareness.Video clips on youtube:""Yogilates Level 3 video clip""""Yogilates Level 3 by Jonathan Urla""""Yogilates in the media""You'll also find clips of his level 1 & 2 on there as well."
5,Very Creative !!!!! Full of new and different ideas.....,"This salad book by Ray Overton lived up to my every expectation. I have Ray's Main-Course Soups and am thrilled to know this is now a series. Can't wait to get Main-Course Sandwiches.The recipes in the salad book are so creative and different. Some of our favorites are the Fiery Thai Beef Salad, Pecan Crusted Goat Cheese Salad, and the Southwestern (Layered) Black Bean Salad. The dressings are easy and can be made ahead (they're even better when allowed to sit in the fridge overnight). Can't wait to try more!I met Ray at a demo/signing in NYC last month. He is a delight. Why haven't we seen him on the TV Food Network? He'd give Emeril some sleepless nights worrying about this creative guy taking over his Live show. With the books he's written and his vast culinary knowledge, humor, style, and personality, it's time for a change!"
3,Princess Door Plate,"The Princess door plate was heavy duty, looked great. My only problem was finding some place to get it engraved. Make sure you know where to get this done before purchasing the item."
1,Dont waste your money!!!!,I bought this for my daughter and with less than six months the back sticky part feel off and the product itself is very small. Even whenever I got the product I was not satisfied!!!
5,Authentic setting + great characters & plot,"This author knows her stuff regarding how academe works, the dynamics of English departments, and being a women in the academy. Hero is a working class Kate Fansler. Just sorry that Joanne Dobson doesn't seem to be writing mysteries any more."
2,Quality control lacking?,"Harp made only a buzzing noise much like something that is not an instrument. After some bending of the outside prongs as per another user's suggestion, I got somewhat of the right sound from it. It is however not very loud at all. I can't hear it playing it, but my wife says she can if I play it in her ear."
1,POS,This review should be a string of unprintable reviews but I am being polite. The even slightest mis-stroke ruins any attempt to make it properly tone.
4,Sketchy,"I bought one from Sam Ash a few months ago, it worked fine until I lost it at camp. I bought another one but it was defective. I couldn't return it because it was in my mouth. I bought another one but it didn't work ether. I eventually fixed both of them into working but one sounds deeper. I loved my old one though, people loved me for playing it, I made friends though it and it is a very interesting instrument."
2,Not work with my internet,"Seller says it work well, I tried to connect it to my cable modem and setup at home, but failed every time. Then I tried in my office with static IP address, it works.I asked the seller to help, the seller said that it works well and asked me to contact my internet provider. My internet provider asked me to contact manufacturer for help. I gave up, and got another router, Linksys, it works well with my internet. This router maybe not good enough, so I give it two stars."
5,Great classic markers,"Another fine product from Crayola.....great for coloring that involves more detailed work. So far, so good....no complaints about this product."
4,enjoyable if not taken too seriously,"These novels are best when you take them for what they are. They are light mystery novels with a little bit of comedy and witty dialogue mixed in.This is the third novel in the Myron Bolitar series (the first two are Deal Breaker and Drop Shot) and it follows basically the same formula. It isn't necessary, however, to read the first two to enjoy this one. Coben does a good job of constructing the novels with the ability for each one to stand on it's on if needed.I enjoy the dialogue as much as anything else. Coben is able to keep me very entertained with the back and forth between his very original characters as we follow them through plot twists, turns, and suprises.This novel is more sports based than the other two which made it that much more enjoyable to me.A fun light read that doesn't take itself too seriously. You shouldn't either."
4,An Enjoyable Read,Ths book was fast read. It had a mix of humoous moments to suspense and mystedry. A fun book to read that included interesting and likable characters.
4,Bolitar's 3rd book,"This story was a little weaker than the previous Myron Bolitar novels. But a weak Coben story is still better than 90% of any other author out there. The ending, in Coben style, was quite a surprise. Overall, it is not as stellar as the two previous Bolitar offerings, but like I said above, it's still a great book."
1,Not the real product??,"I have used this product for years and the stuff I received does not look, feel or react with my hair the way it should.Someone suggested to me that it MAY not be the product that the bottle says it is!!I never even thought that someone would fill the bottle with an inferior product.Buyer Beware!!"
2,"Not particularly funny, and relatively weak overall","It has been said that beauty is subjective, and perhaps humor is as well, since the reviews for this movie are rather mixed. I'm afraid that I must be counted among those who didn't find it particularly funny overall, though it did have some funny moments, with the humor being mostly in the goofy category. This is all the more unfortunate because the cast includes several fairly big names, so their presence in this movie was largely wasted. And adding insult to injury, the tangential attempt to deal with some serious themes (death, significance of one's life, tolerance, family relationships, etc.) comes across as very superficial and contrived.Sorry, I can't recommend this movie, not even for a few laughs. Stated differently, I feel that the time I put into it was wasted."
1,Death at a Funeral,Below par movie. Relied on bathroom humor. Not particularly funny. Below Danny Glover's standards.
1,Death Of A Funeral,"Man where do i start, it was more like,when am i going to die, it was painful , it's like i forgot how to laugh, and i couldn't wait until this movie was over"
3,twilightmomforever,I loved the first one. The Brits did a fantasic job but this one was okay. They tried to make it word for word and it just didn't work. Maybe if I was to watch this one first it would of been funny but this one was missing something. And I love Martin Lawerence and Chris Rock. But guys it just didn't jive. The actor doing the person on drugs is the one who held the movie together. Watch the first and then watch this one and you will see what I am talking about. I don't like to trash movies but this one just didn't have it!
1,Extreme homophobia+incessant poop jokes=Worst Movie Ever,"I feel my title really explains my feelings about this movie. I enjoy an absurd off-color comedy as much as the next guy, but this movie was absolutely horrible. The jokes could be seen a mile away, except for a fountain of diarrhea we get to witness. That was a surprise.The worst part was the extreme homophobia throughout the film. The film makes light of, and reinforces the ""homosexual-as-blackmailer"" stereotype which most directors would have the good taste to avoid. The directors' ham-fisted attempt at excusing these outrages with a trite ""Live and let live"" blurb at the end is completely ridiculous. Literally the worst movie I have ever seen. Avoid at all costs!"
4,funny,Purchase now for the winter months. Won't disappoint for family laughter for the family. Chris Rock and Martin Lawrence are hilarious together.
2,Watch British Version Instead (2007),"Great actors and comedians, but as an ensemble picture, this comedy just falls flat. The original British version, however, is very funny. Peter Dinklage plays the same role in both movies."
2,Read this before buying.......,"I bought this item for my son and the Love and Licks Jack Russell for a Christmas party gift. The ""bark"" sounds more like a whine and I have yet to get either of the dogs to wag their tail or kick their leg like the box says. Followed instructions to the letter and neither of them licks. Sounded like a great gift.Update, I contacted the manufacturer and was told by the customer service rep. that she too had trouble getting it to work. Suggested that I try rubbing ""extremely"" hard under the collar on the neck. This did work and after getting the dog started it is pretty cute. No where in the directions does it tell you about rubbing under the neck. If buying this for a smaller child, be warned it will definitely take and older person to get the dog barking, wagging and licking."
2,breaks easly,hi im a huge traxxas geek i can take apart my traxxas roev 3.3 and put it back tagether.The gear it is the original but it's not for jumps if you want to do that id get a steel 40 t instead it slos down alitle but it great fot jumps etc. in short ok but not the best.
2,What a disappointment,"Like another reviewer I too was expecting more. Much more. Had I been in the eighth grade this would be appropriate, almost, for a book report. But there is no depth, no footnoting, no details. There is a picture of a prayer book, printed upside down, so I guess there was no competent editing either. Sorry, this book doesn't cut it."
