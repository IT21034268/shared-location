1,"Whatever happened to ""Bob"" or ""George?""","I put this thing down after 20 or so pages. ""Monk."" ""Grey."" ""Painter."" Could we have a ""Bob"" or a ""Dennis,"" please? Apart from the names, it simply wasn't believable. Marquez put a version of the Wandering Jew in South America, a girl who turned into a spider/scorpion, an immortal dictator, and he made it all believable. This simply seemed silly."
1,I don't like paperback books. James Rollins (Black Order),I only purchase hard cover books for reading and my library. I missed this one. It came to me as a paperback.My error. Never again.
4,Great story with enough research behind the story to make you learn.,"This is another great book with the character Gray, as a scientist-super spy. The book Map of Bones before this one was quite a ride as well.The author James Rollins seems to be able to take you with the characters that you find are quite likable. I've found that I cared enough about the main characters to not set the book down until they were out of the tight situation that they were in.What it would be to have the life of one of the main characters.Great entertainment.~Amstracer"
4,Great novel,"Great novel, as usual from Rollins. Lots of action and excitement. New characters made things interesting. I will continue to read Sigma Force Novels."
2,Overly long,"The main story is interesting and even thrilling, the problem is to find it. Some times the book is so boring that you'll want to close it and never open it again. So when you'll close the book for good you'll be really happy.The main plot could be or not kind of true but it has too many stories around and that keeps the book in a lower key."
3,Going downhill,His best novel by far has been Amazonia. I also liked his first two novels Subterranean and Excavation. Actually I have liked all his novels but have noticed that I can put his latest novels down for a break or to go to bed whereas the first novels I couldn't put down. Sometimes he is getting too technical with his writing and it bogs it down somewhat. I think he could still be able to explain the intricacies of the tech or bio stuff without going into so much detail. I do like the way he uses animals in his books......I used to be a vet assistant so anything with animals I will always like. But I must say the jaguar's in Amazonia were the best!
3,"Eh, read something else","I picked up this book while waiting for my car to be fixed, and once started, I enjoyed it enough to finish. But I do not recommend this book to anyone. The plot is somewhat interesting, and the writing is adequate. However, the book just falls flat for me. I didn't empathize with any of the characters or really become engaged with the story. If you're stranded somewhere and need to waste some time, this book may be acceptable. However, in my opinion, there are too many great books to waste time reading merely adequate books. Look elsewhere."
1,Lacks Order,"This books seemed like it was slapped together for a TV movie. The dialogue was atrocious and the plot contrived. The pieces of a decent thriller were present, but the way they were described, cobbled together and used as a forum for Rolllins' debate on evolution vs. intelligent design did not make for a good novel. The suspenseful moments were few and far between and those that were present were resolved by ridiculous plot gimmicks. I was bored by the first quarter of the book and only finished it because of my own perverse sense of seeing things through to the end."
4,A first time reader,"Having met the author recently, I liked him enough to buy his book full price. :-) Now I'll have to read the rest. Non-stop adventure spiced with some scientific theory and flavored with a touch of romance. The Sigma Force team have brains, brawn and sensitivity, and the women dragged on their adventures have the intelligence, skills and guts to keep up. Short vignettes keep the pace moving - and are particularly useful if you have to read in short chunks on the bus, the treadmill or while rappelling down a cravasse."
5,Great thrill ride,"i couldnt put this book down, had me hooked from about 10 pages in. its a great thrill ride that will take you across 4 continents. i liked how james rollins had references to some of his previous books in here, makes you feel like you've been following the life of grayson pierce(the hero in the book) for awhile. i would definately recommend this book for anyone who's into thrillers."
3,Creativity vs. Writing Ability,"James Rollins is a conundrum. He's incredibly creative, writes fast-paced thrillers, and generally has intriguing science, history, and ideas forming the backbone of his stories. His actual story-telling, though, doesn't live up to the backbone.Black Order has an excellent pace although POV switches occur too often for my personal taste (once every 2-4 pages). My biggest beef with this book (and Rollins' writing in general) is that he often tells and rarely shows. There are numerous violations of this unwritten writers rule in Black Order and Map of Bones, and that disappoints me greatly because Rollins is an otherwise solid writer.Rollins is a good writer, but not a great one. If you want a cheap thrill, Black Order will suffice. I'm actually a big fan of Rollins because of one thing: he's consistent. You'll never be bored to tears, and that's more than you can say for other authors. Just don't expect good metaphors, internal dialogue, or subtle nuances."
4,Acton Hero and Mr. Wizard,Another exciting adventure with Sigma force. James Rollins does it again. How he combines science with action is amazing. I particularly liked the historical connection to Nazi science. Again very well done can't wait for the next adventure.the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was the science content of quantum theory got a little over my head and I was a little lost but after I while I understood what the science meant.PS a very cool prosthetic hand (Monk)
5,all-time favourite,"after many years of reading this book, i still haven't found another of this genre to top it! it is so wonderful, exciting and adventurous. the back of the book describes is as colourful, and that's exactly what it is!! the hero is so much in love, so tender and strong and protective of the heroine. and the best is he tries to win her love all through the book, to prove to her he's worthy of her trust and love..... he cares for her, protects her, saves her from danger, but is never arrogant.in fact, he is rather humble which fits in with the heroine being insecure, but a really strong, mature, fighting woman.evey time i read it (many many many many through the years) i can't believe someone wrote such a deeply romantic, perfect book!p.s. there are sex scenes in the book, unfortunately (this is just my opinion) but they are married when they happen and anyway, if you are like me, and prefer not to read this stuff, you can just skip it."
1,TV-out VGA to S-Video/RCA Cable Adapter,"VGA output was broken, they maild me another, but not the same item, but the other item I bought with this adapter. Now I have 2 the same adapters with a s-Video and video/RCA cables adapter."
3,Good idea but did not work for me,I've tried using this adapter with my desktop and laptop but neither seems compatible with this adapter. :( My bedroom still does not have video in it. I might just buy a new TV for my bedroom and run HDMI.
1,Know what your buying.,"I admit iam a dumb a ss and didnt buy the right thing wanted to connect laptop to TV.IT worked but showed black and white and was awful.Instead i just bought thisHigh Speed HDMI Cable, 6 feet (Colors may vary)It worked, crystal clear,awsome,sound and better than this cr ap.* If you want to conect your laptop to TV with the product above make sure both laptop and Tv have HDMI ports."
1,Useless for me!,"After the VGA port of my TV went bad, I looked for a solution to get the video from my computer to the television via VGA connection from my computer to the S-Video connection on the TV. This product promised it would do just that. After connecting it to both, I got nothin'! And I do mean nothing. I don't know if the product is just worthless, or if I missed something, because no mater what I've tried, this product DOES NOT WORK. And mailing it back would be a waste of time, as the postage would have cost more than the actual product itself. Waste of my time and money..."
2,trying to hook up my MACBOOK PRO to a TV,It won't hook a Macbook Pro up to a TV even with the VGA adapter. I still have to buy a $30-60 VGA converter box so it's not really what I thought it would be.
3,VGA to RCA,I was looking for a RCA video to VGA to use a video source to a monitor. Does not work that way.
1,ps2 to hdmi/vga monitor,"I got this hoping could bridge the gap from my ps2 to my tv (which is really a monitor) that only has hdmi and vga. Unfortunately, the monitor never found any signals coming from the ps2. So it doesn't work."
1,Won't work with a TV!,This device will not work from a PC to a TV. If that is your intention do not buy this product!
4,Neat!,"I haven't tried this with a necklace or bracelet yet, so I'm not sure how it'll stand up in wear, but I like the concept and it's easier for people to affix their jewelry than a lobster or ring clasp."
5,as splendid a set as I ever hope to find,"These were my first CDs from this label and they constitute one of the most beautifully produced sets I have encountered. To the reviewer whose advice I took: yes I would have regretted missing this one, for it is one of the finest tributes to a performing artist imaginable. The booklet is a hard read, but you won't care about any opinions expressed after you hear the recordings. That is why you will want this set: for the heart and soul of the music that Ignaz Friedman conveyed and is nowhere near as easy to come by in modern recordings."
1,Broken without Warranty,"At first my daughter loved this. After maybe 4-8 hours of use, the CD stopped playing. I tried to locate a manufacturer warranty, but haven't had any luck. I'm sorry, but I think a $50 product should last a year."
3,how thunder and earthquake made ocean,I thinck this book was a litte shourt and I most whated to read it and it was very good but there needs to be more but it was good about the the village and tunder and earthquake so was ok right on the good marck so that's why I ratind it with 3 stars.
2,Too flimsy for heavy use,"The laser alignment is very helpful, but this plastic version does not hold up to heavy usage. I've gone through two already, and each has lasted maybe 9 months. The parts that control the laser light switching on and off are extremely sensitive and can be easily dislodged permanently if you accidentally push the cutting lever down too hard. If that happens, that's the end of the trimmer. Very disappointing considering the cost. I am trying out the wood base version (which only costs about $6 more on amazon) to see if it holds up better."
3,Just One Kiss was a promise of something more!,"Johnson's novel was an all-nighter and an okay read. I was so caught up in the book at the beginning. So much was happening all at once, and a little confusing. So much mystery and suspense. But after that the book slowed down. Then by the mid end of the book the story seemed finished, but was added on too. But it was still an okay story, I found it sweet. I love the part about the medical condition that many men seem not likely to discuss or acknowledge( extra in my book)."
3,Romeo and Juliet Cliff notes,"This is a good book to have for background information on Shakespeare and it will get you through most things you need. However, I recommend No Fear Shakespeare over this product if you want to be able to read and understand the play in plain modern English. If you just want a book to help clarify your understanding but do not want to read the entire play in plain English then this is the book for you!"
2,Timing,"Really, this one little book I ordered took way too long to get here. I know the sellers give themselves an exorbitantly wide swath of time to get things to you - to cover themselves, but I usually have very consciencious, speedy deliveries. Not this seller...took almost his entire allotted time. C'mon!"
2,old time music,"Old time music but I thought there would be more than one or two songs that would draw me in, there wasn't."
3,"Save Your Money, No Hits Here","I am getting tired of all these albums being called ""Biggest"", ""Greatest"", ""Ultimate"", it is not the truth. While they all have some good tunes, they are by no stretch of the imagination ""Biggest"" or ""Greatest."" Want hits, the buy Don Omar, Daddy Yankee, Luny Tunes, Mas Flow, The Beginning, or Ragga Nacion. They have hits (not all hits, but more than this package)."
2,Not what you'd think from DCC,"As you probably know, most DCC CDs were mastered by Steve Hoffman, whose philosophy is to present the music in as natural a manner as possible, focusing on the vocals. Unfortunately, after Hoffman mastered ""Bewitching-Lee!"", Peggy Lee's manager vetoed its release (because Hoffman had eschewed the drenching echo of previous releases and instead mastered straight from the session tapes). Substituted were wretched masters by the king of NoNoise and artificial processing, Bob Norberg (the guy who killed Sinatra's Entertainer Of The Century Capitol discs and countless other Capitol vocalist releases). This disc is partially salvaged by the fact that ""Is That All There Is"" is Hoffman's work rather than Norberg's.The used pricing on this disc seems to reflect the fact that it's Norberg rather than Hoffman, but if ""Is That All There Is"" is your favorite Peggy Lee tune, then by all means pick this CD up for the definitive mastering of that song."
3,Threshold Extra,"I reviewed this cd when it first came out and gave it 5 stars. But after listening to it quite alot I deleted that review and have it revised it as a 3 star cd. It's not really the music or that Mac sings most of the lead vocals on this cd. It's the terrible back-up vocals and lead on some of the other songs that just proves to be unbearable to listen to, at least to me. It's no wonder that this band never made it with their lead singer because he/she can't sing. I would find myself skipping over those songs. Overall, for the Threshold fan there's a few good tracks, but it's not Threshold and I think Mac should just concentrate on what he has instead of venturing out into other groups territories."
4,A great book of a great man,"Stephen E. Ambrose has created an awesome biography about a man that realized his importance and task in a critical part of the history. Dwight Eisenhower was not necessary a great soldier, but a tremendous leader and general. He united the countries that was known as the allies(WWII), a task that was very difficult at that time. With his big smile and a well of energy and straight forwardness he motivated the soldiers to attack the beaches of Normandy with precision and rage. For his greatest military success was ""Operation Overlord"". The book gives the readers an insight of the life of a person that have to carry the big burden of responsibility, and how he later, at a relatively high age, went for the presidency. It shows how the tide can turn and how destiny brings a man from an average officer into the corridors of power. Stephen E. Ambrose has managed to involve Eisenhowers ups and downs in a good manner. Recommended for people that is interested in leadership."
1,"Simplistic plot, amateurish writing","William Shatner should stick to acting. I am a science fiction, and Star Trek fan, and I found this book's plot to be very simplisitic - the first clue being its constant references to 'Frisco' - with an ending that fails to resolve the plot's setups. Very light listening. Great if you can find it for a dollar or two at an auction site, otherwise skip it."
4,"Tekwar II, the adventure continues","In the second novel of Shatner's ""Tek"" series, future sleuth Jake Cardigan is back and trying to rebuild a life with his new girlfriend Beth. The Tek lords have been busy though, and have created a new and deadly weapon,a synthetic plague, in order to blackmail world leaders into permitting Tek. Jake's search for the cause, and cure of the plague lead him through the usual deadly adventures to a climactic battle with an unexpected enemy in Japan.Much like the first ""Tek"" novel, this is a fast paced sci-fi/mystery that doesn't go overboard on the plot development. Which is A-ok, becuase it's not meant to be a deep or meaningful novel in any way, shape, or form. It's got a lot to enjoy though, with non-stop adventure, a budding romance, and an edge of mystery that will keep the pages turning. If you enjoyed 'Tekwar', than you won't be disappointed with 'Teklords'."
4,One of my favorites,"This movie is great for all ages..if you are truly a kid, or just a kid at heart. The message is great."
2,Worthless to red,This was a waste of money.. simple log builds. Nothing real informative. I want to know how to build a real log home. This is way to basic and gets into building other structures... save you money.
4,cool,cool book in need of some more details but if your looking to dream about building a cabin this is a dream builder to start with
4,Excellent Dictionary- Poor cover,"I recently bought this dictioanry, it's very good and complete. The picture shown on Amazon though is misleading, it does not clearly indicate it is bilingual, in fact I bought it thinking it was monolingual- I should have guessed as the cover reads : Italian and not Italiano, but anyway, there's no indication of the fact."
4,I'd like to read it again,"This book is a lost friend for me - I loaned it and it never found its way home when it was first published. I'd like to buy it again so that I can enjoy it once more. A good story well written, a ""keeper""."
3,Great phone but mediocre sound quality,"I love the concept of the phone, and you can't beat the long-term savings of making SkypeOut your only ""landline."" The phone itself is also easy to use. Our only complaint is that the sound quality could be better. We've rarely had any complaints about the sound quality of Skype when we use it to call regular phones on our computer, but we've had problems with echoes, having voices sound like someone is talking in a tunnel, etc., a much greater percentage of the time when using the Netgear phone."
5,Works Great,"Plug the base unit into a router that has a high speed internet connection and it can make Skype internet phone calls. There is also a connection for a regular phone line so I can choose which line to answer or call out on.I set up the Skype account with a computer and entered contacts etc. I also set up the base unit with a web browser but it is easy enough to input ""user name"" and ""password"" via the phone keypad.The phone automatically down loads all of the contacts that you have previously set up with Skype.This is easy to set up, works great, and best of all no dedicated computer is required for Skype."
5,Best way to use Skype,"What can I say?1. I charged the phone for 15 hours as directed.2. I entered my Skype ID and password.3. I made calls to Costa Rica and USA immediately without a hitch.4. I made calls on my Vonage service without a hitch.5. It eliminated the ""echo"" I had with my laptop microphone.6. It is just like using a regular landline phone.7. I love the small size, and have no problem using it on my shoulder.8. Speaker phone works great too.9. The interface is very easy unless one is really non computer literate.10. If I could give it a ""10,"" I would.I bought one for my Daughter and for my house in Costa Rica.Recommend it!Jim Alfaro"
2,Too clumsy,1) Sound quality is terrible - worse than when I use Skype from my laptop with ordinary built-in speakers. The phone is only about 10 feet away from the access point (antenna).2) The menus are a ridiculous maze... many many keystrokes just to get to voice mail.3) The dual line makes it a bigger pain to use - you constantly have to choose which line to use. It should be a user setting which defaults to one line or the other unless you choose differently.I wish I had seen some of the poor reviews before purchasing.
5,Best phone for skype!,This telephone is the best in the market for skype calls.Very easy to use and setup.I just love it.
4,This is a re release,"Imagine my excitement when I saw that there was a new CD from the awesome Dimitri. then imagine my chagrin when I discovered it is a re-release marketing ploy.Sure this is a great cd, but don't buy it if you already have ""Mixmag Presents Monsieur Dimitri's De-Luxe House Of Funk"" which sat in my cd player for practically all of 1998 and defined that summer for me.-- it's the same CD repackaged. I almost bought it again since I buy anything and everything from Dimitri.C'mon Dimitri, put out something new!"
5,Amazing Product,"DeOxIT is amazing stuff. I restore motorcycles. A small quantity of this on electrical connections solves so many hard to locate electrical problems. It takes such a small amount that this 25ml bottle will be a lifetime supply. I have also tried the spray, but think this may be easier to use. Magic on flashlights. Just put a small amount on the battery contacts of the light and each battery. No more trouble getting the light to turn on, even when it has been stored. Seems to improve any electrical connection."
5,This is GREAT!!!!!,"I bought the hand-held version of the crayon sharpener for my 5-year-old and while she needs help, it restores dull old crayons to like-new points - I mean, who wants to color with crayons that are not sharp? Not me. I am going to go to our Sunday School department and sharpen all their crayons and then we'll use the shavings to make mother's day suncatchers for grandma and aunts."
1,Tokyo pop - Company out of touch,"My girls have been fans of Sailor Moon, Rayearth, Tenchi and many other series. We came across Saint Tail by accident, but my younger girls really enjoy the series and wait impatiently until the release of the next DVD. This release came as a big disappointment for them.I understand why the company chose to do this (lower cost for them), but I think they need to keep in mind their audience. It would have been easy for the company to either release two DVD products or to have included both languages on the DVD.I don't know if this change in format will stop us from buying further Saint Tail DVD's. It will all depend on if the consumers (my girls) fail to watch this DVD as much as the previous titles because it is too difficult for them to read and watch the action at the same time. The whole purpose for watching a movie is enjoyment, not frustration."
2,"Junior, not Buddy","This is basically a Junior Wells album featuring Buddy Guy. Buddy gets to sing on 2 0 3 tracks, and the guitar playing is not as intense. Get the A man and the blues instead"
1,Don't Buy this Item ~ it's a rip-off!,"I am very disappointed in this grinder. I think the manufacturer should STOP selling it. It is light weight & poorly made. Mine arrived with scratches on the base and the bottom screw won't hold. I attempted grinding coffee beans and 10 minutes later, not much progress. It is nothing like the grinder I had 20 years ago (same design). Its not worth it to send it back so guess I'll use it as a door stop or a planter. Buyers Beware ~ this grinder is poor quality and doesn't look good even as a decoration. The wood base and drawer front are a weird orange color. I wish I would have taken the time to read the other product reviews. I've learned my lesson."
3,Great as decoration,"It looks nice on the shelf in the kitchen, I don't intended to use it for real grinding, at least before carefully cleaning all the metal parts (it is smelly and covered with technical oil)"
4,Neat Coffee Grinder,This coffee grinder works well and looks great on our countertop. It looks so well that a person might want to buy one even if they never want to use it to grind any coffee.
2,"This item is of poor quality, save your money!","Hard to get a good grind, paint on wood is of poor quality and is coming off.Need to turn the handle a long time to get any coffee."
5,VERY SATISFIED,WE WERE VERY SATISFIED WITH OUR JEANS.VERY COMFORTABLE FOR HORSE RIDING.PERFECT FOR COWBOYS!
3,Stunning but overwhelming!,"The book had some great ideas. Things that perhaps you have seen but did not know how to do. The thing that I did not like about the book is that is assumed you already knew what to do and it fairly much glazed over the idea or ideas. If you are a person who has been stamping for a year or two, it may seen simple but for a newer stamper it leaves you wanting more explanation. I was dissapointed with that part of the booklet but happy with the photos and mixture of ideas that it shared."
5,"Guitarist, composer, singer, songwriter, poet, philosopher...","Apart from writing ""Milord"" for Edith Piaf, George Moustaki is a part of France - his importance resembles that of Bob Dylan (except that Moustaki has a better voice, he is a better composer and far better guitarist), or, I would say, Bob Dylan has a similar place in the history of American culture. Moustaki is the voice and soul of 1968 in France. Moustaki is more vital than Sartre. Politically engaged (anarchist), he remains an excellent poet. This is one of his best albums, featuring outstanding legendary left-hand gypsy guitarist Jose Pisa* (""Flamenco""), singing about Jesus who came unnoticed (""Humbly He Came...""), philosophy of existence.If you don't know Moustaki, you don't know France. Together withLe Metequeit is must* Unique chance to hear him playing - recordings are not so easy to find"
3,a bit disappointing,"While many Jaguares/caifanes fans was disappointed with ""Bajo el azul de tu misterio""I was disappointed with this. It begun with the horrible song ""Como tu"", fortunitialy the other songs are better, but not much better I am afraid. There are a couple of songs here which almost are on the same level as their other albums ""El secreto"" a really catchy punk/rock song(the first song I liked here), ""Vijae Astral"" a rock/pop song, and ""Viejo el mundo"" is very good!. But the others kind of goes in the one ear and out the other, track 4 is great. La vida no es igual is original, but not in my cup of tea. I just felt that I had heard al this before by other groups. But then again it is much better then al the Mtv rock out there thats for sure!"
2,Using Java1.2,"Yes and No. The book is excellent at giving an overview of many concepts that are pertinent to understanding the plethora of all that comprise the Java technology and how it all generally works together. But as for an intermediate rated programming book with lots of programming examples, it is terrible. The book is notorious for talking about Java programming concepts and never showing you how to do it nor giving effective coding samples. As for presenting Java programming, the book reminds me of bumping into somebody in bar who claims to be a ""Java developer/programmer"" and talks all the snappy terminology. Then when you ask them a specific question, they change the subject."
2,Not that great.....,This gun is OK. It hurts a little if you're close enough. But from far away (more than about 25 feet) it does nothing. The person can be standing still and you won't be able to hit them. Basically it's a dinky little gun worth about 4 dollars.
2,"the good, the bad, the BORED!","GOOD = HAS SOME GOOD TIPS ON BUDGETING,AND BANKING.BAD = CONSTANT PLUGS, A BIT ARROGANT...MEMEMEMEME!BORED = BOOK TAPE IS BORING,AND MONOTONED"
4,Ok...,"The person that gave Juice a negative review and spoke about Jay-Z in comparison is an idiot... Thats all you need to know...#2 Rap music started out with ""random lyrics"" as that idiot calls it. A Juice album is not meant for everyone... its actually meant for people who like listening to Rap music in its most original form, and not the overly mainstream versions that you hear on the radio... If thats what you are looking for, go buy a Jay-Z album..."
2,Review for Bo,"From reading this book, I find myself respecting Ursula Andress and Linda Evans more than I ever thought possible. In the case of Linda and Ursula, their beauty is far, far more than skin deep. What wonderful, forebearing women they must be. The author could learn a lot from them about humility and self-effacing behavior. Bo's early years were enjoyable to read about, I was genuinely amused at some of the antics of her and her siblings. All in all, not too bad a book, really."
2,false start,"My review of this product is incomplete. It is a great looking and useful product. The set up is fairly simple, however in my exprience the product that I received was damaged. My advice to purchasers of this and similar products like this through websites like amazon is to have plan to test the product before using it. Mine was not a horror story as the seller was gracious and refunded my money but it is important to be cautious and have a plan in place. leasson learned."
4,A Classic,"No early-60's folkie's collection was complete without this one. Although Ian went on to become a C&W/Cowboy singer and retained some degree of popularity, especially in Canada, this album is pure folk, from the golden era of Dylan, Paxton and Ochs. Many of the songs have since become classics. Any folk fan should have this in their collection for the historic value alone, but even today it stands out for its simple tunes and pretty harmonies."
5,Very good film,"This is the X rated version of the film. The sex scenes are well done within the context of the story. This was made at a time when the X rated material was part of the story. The film was remastered and looks fantastic in this DVD version. Highly recommend if you are interested in this genre [devil, possession, nuns, innocent girl possessed]. The language is Italian, but it does have English subtitles."
5,MALABIMBA,MALABIMBA IS A VERY VERY VERY BEAUTIFUL ITALIAN ITALIAN FILMMALABIMBA IS A VERY VERY VERY BEAUTIFUL ITALIAN ITALIAN FILM
2,Disappointing,"So short it's not worth the cost. Considering the fascinating historical and literary subject matter, very little was made of it. Pass on this one and find another source elsewhere."
3,A bit basic,"I would have expected a bit more from a book called ""airline finance"" - while there is a lot of breadth, the author rarely goes into detail on any one topic - like others have said, this book is more of an ""outline"" than a reference text. Also, the material is dated - given the recent movements in the airline industry, it would have been interesting to see a little bit more on acquisition finance, network synergies, etc. Obviously the author has no control over this...Not sure if the books worth the money if you're looking for a detailed in depth guide but you will become familiar with industry terms and get an overall sense of how airline finance might work."
3,Time flies too fast,"Basically the Book is good in terminology, genearal formula and methodology etc. The problems are (obviously) actual data. Major of them are coming from years 2003 - 2005. Can they be compared with those today (especially fuel) ? But different cost results completely changed the industry (just from the last week monitoring : XL, Alitalia . . . . , SAS, ... Brussels airlines). I do not wish to blame the author, just to recall everybody how fast time flies .... and how difficult is to be ""in"" with updated (completed) data in airline business. Solution can be online, elearning etc. Is Amazon thinking about such solution ? With kind regards Bohuslav"
5,Wonderful step by step instructions,"I have been the in craft industry for over 14 years as a business owner, designer, and teacher. I enjoyed this book for many reasons, but especially the wonderful step by step instructions and pictures. The instructions are easy to follow and the pictures help make everything clear how to do each step.The book touched numerous techniques that are for every level of crafting and made the reader feel like stamping really is for everyone! Card making and stamps can be expensive but the authors did a nice job of telling readers how to make their own stamps and use inexpensive methods of creating beautiful cards.My favorite technique shown is the ""Decorated Cake"". The picture and instructions made me want to go right out and try this because the results are so beautiful! Anybody who wants to better their crafting skills would be wise to read this book!"
2,"Significant performances, dismal sound","This Praga CD (a label of the French company Le Chant du Monde), first released in 1993, has been reissued in 2004:Aram Khachaturian: Concertos for Violin & Piano, and you'll find it cheaper there.It documents two live performances given during the first (Piano Concerto) and second (Violin Concerto) Prague Spring Festivals, in 1946 and 1947. The performances are significant (both Oborin and Oistrakh were the respective composition's first performer and dedicatee), but the sound is so awful as to strongly hamper any enjoyment, or even appreciation of their interpretive worth. Obviously the recording equipment available in post-war Prague was primitive. See under the other entry for a more detailed review. Unless you are a diehard admirer and collector of any or all of the artists involved, avoid."
3,Rehash,"This book is a rehash of well-known techniques in the field. Apparently, the author read much what was on the market and presented the techniques under different names. If you are a novice to the field, the book has value. If you have read much in the field, the book has no value."
3,So-so,"Similar to Offshore Angler, this book does not provide sufficient detail to be effective and the chapters are more of a novel type of description and does not get technical enough to suit me."
5,Fantastic Voice,"This is one of those albums that I enjoy every song and listen to them regularly. Today with the convenience of being able to buy only a song that you like off an album it is rare to find an album that every song is good, but that is the case with this one! She has a beautiful voice as well."
1,Anastacia Overshoots,"This artist gets a lot of exposure so I picked up the album to see what was the deely-o. Honestly, don't waste the money. Whip out your old Taylor Dane CD and clip out a picture of Carmen Electra - and you are covered. Cliched lyrics aren't helped by Anastacia's quirky voice."
2,okayee,"its not too bad...if you are over 100 or dont mind listening to songs that were hits during the spanish- american war and WWI! Maybe your grandma would like it, though..."
4,This IS Galactic NOLA,"So much for the two star guy.. he needs to get his ears cleaned, and see the band now, not in 1999. This band is so progressive that he didn't even realize who he was listening to! Yeah, you don't get the energy of a live show on a CD, and Nick did fool with the dials, but the more you listen to this, the more you'll realize that these guys are the real deal. Funk, groove, jammin' rock and all the NOLA you want. Mercurio holding the base down, Stanton pounding, Vogel getting funked-out in the shadows and Raines stepping into the spotlight and tearing it up. The CD is a B, the band live is an A. Check it out."
3,A solid disc worth having,"Having seen these guys live a couple of times, I know they spare no expense (sweat) in kicking out the groove. This recording is no exception to the fantastic live sound that results. However, I think the creative punch of the band has been tapering since Coolin' Off. Granted, they've produced some gems since that first disc, but have failed to recapture that fresh feel that originally turned me on to their sound. This album is not necessarily a natural progression in that trend, as it does include some very interesting covers, and a previously unreleased Moog Marmalade (which is sick), but I feel like they need to switch gears to retain my interest. Bottom line, you should own this album, especially if you're into galactic, but don't expect it to blow your mind."
3,Basic beginner's spider book,This is a good book for getting to know about spiders but not one to use if you are trying to identify a particular spider. It provides the basics about the nature of spiders in general and has some good photos.
4,A great reference that adds to your understanding of bobbin laces,"This instructional book illustrates 262 different bobbin lace reseaus and stitches with photos of examples, drawings of the stitches, and instructions and prickings for each stitch. It is a wonderful resource for understanding what differentiates the various reseaus and fillings, as in photographs, they are often hard to distinguish. Great to be used in conjunction with Pat Earnshaw's *Identification of Lace* when analyzing a piece of lace."
2,Academic Tedium,"This book typifies one of the problems in the social sciences today: endless banal banter about methodology. I have great respect for many of the scholars in this volume and cite their work often, but in this volume, they are at their worst. Collectively, these essays cover routine methodological issues in tedious detail, but issues that are also basic and which should be familiar to researchers. I can't imagine that anyone other than an academic could find this book at all interesting. As a researcher of (neo)paganism myself, I bought this to converse, in a sense, with colleagues I have never met, but these essays offer nothing new. They might be useful in an undergraduate research methods class, or the stuff of conversation over drinks at a professional conference, but not beyond that."
1,"Out of date, useless book","This book has a shiny cover and copyright date of 2003, but it is severely outdated, and completely useless for the GRE.The answer to one question claims that MOST hard disks contain ""millions"" (or megabytes) of storage -- needless to say I got that question wrong, since I answered ""billions"" (gigabytes).I only bought this book because of utter lack of reference in this category, but do NOT buy this book. Get the subjects covered by the exam, and buy Schaum's outlines series and study those areas. I bought ""operating systems"", ""computer architecture"", and another PASCAL book. Along with my old textbooks, they help much more than this old piece of junk."
1,book took 2 months to arrive! what's up with that?,"Wanted to use the book over the summer...what a joke, arrived after school started. Why did this book take 2 months to ship?Maybe one should order this book a year before needed...really disappointed in logistics of getting the book. Sorry, didn't get a chance to even look at it, just venting..."
1,Stay Away,"If you are a serious artist or student of art, this book is almost a complete waste of time. Drucker's flowery writing is pretentious and difficult to follow, and in the end she has little to say. She also needs a new editor; There is a typo on the first page! (I believe it's ""and and"", but I don't have it in front of me) I also find it frustrating that she has no typographic sense. I took an undergraduate class about artists' books which featured her book. Several design students joked in the back of the class that they shouldn't have to read the book on that basis alone. (These are undergraduate students, not people who are writing books about the art and design of BOOKS.)"
4,It is exactly what it looks like,"It does what it says it does. The size and shape are good for the purpose. I like that it is made of wood and also the way it is shaped with the ridges and all. I do not love it, but I like it."
4,Not a bad book,"As college survival books go, this one ain't half bad. The information is solid, as is the advice. The only flaw it really has is that you don't get a complete picture of the college experience. There is no ""personal"" slant or definitive point-of-view.I recommend purchasing the following two books in addition to Arco as part of a 3 book set for your soon-to-be college freshman:Confessions of a College Freshman: A Survival Guide for Dorm Life, Biology Lab, the Cafeteria, and Other First-Year Adventures(ISBN: 1589196600) This is a good solid first person account of the college experience, and a decent read.College 101 : The Book Your College Does Not Want You To Read(ISBN: 0966412206) The section on computing is dated, but the advice in this book definitely hits home. Guy Stevens holds no punches and has irritated numerous college admission officers.The Arco book, and the two books listed above will prepare any college freshman for the best, and the worst!"
4,I highly recommend this book for college bound students.,"I really recommend this book to seniors about to go to college who really have no idea what to expect. They even provide a checklist in the back so you know exactly what to take to college, and why you need all the things included. I left completely prepared for my journey into the ""real world"" of college life"
3,It isn't as great as some......,"This book does have a lot of common sense information, but it isn't as in-depth as others. There is a chapter on nutrition that is very uneccessary, since most people know the food groups. A lot of it is too basic to be of any use. The internet chapter is absolutely pointless, since most of us know how to use the internet.I would buy "" The Ultimate College Survival Guide"" instead. It was basic, but in-depth as well.It had all the information this book has and then some.No, I am not affiliated with the authors of the book in any way. I am just a college student making a suggestion to freshmen. Why buy this book when there are better ones?"
1,"Tiny, couldn't use, Sent back and NO reimbursement yet!",The medal is so tiny that you can't read it. Poor quality. I couldn't use it. I returned it to the seller and have yet to be reimbursed for the item. The process has been a nightmare for me. I have been working with Amazon for resolution but there's lots that has gone on since mid December. I won't go into it yet but it needs to be resolved fast. It should not be this difficult. I may have to file suit.
1,Schnitzler's Century - An unreadable collection of anecdotes,I was unable to get very far into this unorganized book.Perhaps the author should consider plaigarism.
1,Can read the bible through Jewish eyes when you are not ?,"Bishop Spong is very interesting, instead of attacking conservatives he attacks Christ Himself. The sad thing is for all the good points he has unless you reimagine faith (or lack of faith) like him, you can easily discount his ideas and some of the true things he says. He is an important figure, not because of his scholarship which is laughable... he is important because he does prompt discussion and challenges the complacent."
2,Didn't really have what we wanted for the Dogs,"We bought this to expose our pups to baby sounds. It has too many happy sounds and not enough crying baby sounds. Also, the music is a little freaky."
5,"36"" Hi lift Jack",This is a HiLift Jack. Really nothing else need to be said. It works when you need it. It is the best made
4,Ozzy at his best,"Best tracks are Bark the moon, Secret Loser and Mr.Crowley.A must have for any metal fan."
4,behavior is medicine,"I teach med students and residents and find that this book is one of the best resources to describe the overlay between behavior and physiology. So many students say ""well, that psychology stuff is just intuitive......I know what I'd feel"" without recognizing that what they feel isn't the point - what their patients feel is! This book builds the necessary bridge between intuition and research.My students express surprise that there IS a science behind behavior and there ARE ways to break bad news to patients and there IS a link between psychology and physiology (perhaps best illustrated by the great flow diagram on stress).This book summarizes material well and uses good case examples. If I were going to write a book on behavioral science in medicine, this is the book I'd write."
5,Dame Myra Does It Again!,"Brilliant interpretations of Mozart and the rest. Her playing is dignified, inspired and insightful."
5,region free,Most dvd players can be changed to region free that is what I did so I can watch movies from anywhere !!!
3,Sparkhouse,North & South is a movie you enjoy watching over and over again......If this is half as good would love to have it. Never knew that was a problem with non USA formats....Amazon....shame on you
4,FAST CONDUCTING TAKES AWAY,"THE SINGING IS GREAT BUT THE FAST CONDUCTING TAKES AWAY FROM THE BEAUTIFUL MUSIC. IT MUST HAVE BEEN HARD FRO THE SINGERS KEEPING UP WITH THIS VERY FAST CONDUCTING. THE PRODUCTION LOOKS GREAT BUT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE PLOT. BETTER TO BE HEARD THAN WASH. I COULD NOT STOP FEELING SORRY FOR THE ORLANDO SINGER.WHILE EVERY ONE ON STAGE IS LOOKING GOO,D THE POOR ORLANDO IS A WOMAN WERING A BEARD, REMAINS ME OF THE WOMAN OF THE CIRCUS. SHE IS HARD TO WATCH."
2,Ditto - It does NOT fit the 580EX II,"I'm sure it's a great diffuser but be aware that this does not even come close to fitting the 580EX II flash, it's way too small."
3,Novela de entretenimiento,"Esta novela me pareció más o menos entretenida. Creo que lo mejor que tiene es su planteamiento, que es lo que la hace original y el hecho de que Dan Brown sabe sobre el tema de jesucristo. Sin embargo, le veo varios fallos. La trama es muy de película, más centrada en lo espectacular e inmediato. Los personajes son verdaderamente pobres y un poco estereotipados, la mayor parte, especialmente el protagonista, son una caricatura de personas reales, plagados de tópicos que hacen que no te interese sus vidas ya que no les ves reales en ningún momento. Al antagonista le pasa lo mismo. Es literatura fácil, con buenos planteamientos, buenas ideas, pero un nivel de elaboración muy básico, muy de receta de best seller, de fácil lectura, pero sin llegar al nivel de los pilares de la Tierra y obras de ese tipo. Vamos, una hamburguesa de un burger king."
4,Great Indie Album,"Frederick Maryland Band. Made a little stir in the Baltimore Washington area back in the mid 90's. Good original material, good musicians with some decent tracks. This album is Pre-Myspace and Facebook, Indie Bands like this only received exposure playing live. If this album came out today, you might actually here of this band. Light Rock, Jazz, Classic Rock feel. Good relaxing listen, I have spent 17 dollars on way worse."
2,"More volume, please!","It functions okay, but I find that I can't get it loud enough in noisy situations like an open car window, or the manufacturing floor where I work. Also, people I talk to tell me I have that ""tin can"" sound. I also get a lot of static. My son's Jabra works a lot better. I'm running this with a Motorola Z3."
3,Short Standby time,The standby time is only 8 to 10 hours. I was under the impression that the standby time should be 16 to 18 hours after full charge
2,Too little juice,"There are good things to say about the H350. It is light and simple to use. I liked the flat ear piece and found the ear attachment loop to be convenient.However, it simply doesn't hold a charge long enough to make it worth purchasing in my opinion. I can't rate it more than a 2. I also have the Plantronics Voyager 510 in the car and it is well worth the extra money. The last thing about the Motorola H350 is that the lack of a boom makes it just a little inconvenient for people to hear me.It isn't a horrible product, but limited battery power is enough to make me return this."
3,As described,Looked like a solid product. Time will tell. Always fast shipping with Amazon. Moog has always been on the top of my parts choice when it comes to front end parts.
3,Helps some,Bought the DEWALT DW0714 Laser Enhancement Glasses to improve visibility of my new laser level in the outdoor situation where I planned to use it. They made the line marginally more visible in direct sunlight than it was without the glasses. Found using a white target worked best.
5,Work Like they are supposed to,"Made life significantly easier. I use these in a room where if i turn off the lights, the lights take another 20 minutes to turn back on, so I can keep them on and still make out the line. Great!"
4,good product works find,"its better than trying to find little red dot on sunny day with your eyes (you can't).this glasses help you extend your range to about 80~90 feet.if your trying to find the range more than 100 on a sunny day outside, good luck."
3,Glaases do not look like whats pictured.,"This is another Item that got me with the advertised photo. The glasses that I received look nothing like what is pictured in the ad., again. The actual function of the laser glasses does work. I am able to see the laser line when working outdoors on a bright sunny day, this part I am satisfied with. The glasses that I received are a 1 piece unit, not like what is shown with separate black plastic arms. The arms on mine are of the same material as the glasses, red plastic. and also the nose supports are a red plastic molded to the glasses not separate as shown in the picture. This is the 3rd item that i purchased from Amazon where the item received is nothing like the item shown in the ad. I guess that is the price we pay for buying on line and not from a Dept. store where we can actually look, feel and touch the product before purchase."
4,Interesting survey,"I would recommend this book if you're not looking for an indepth analysis of the 100 years (1843-1943) of treaty-port history. A light read, Wood does a good job in providing a splattering of social history, individual anecdotes, and then some macro-level historical framework. On the whole, its an interesting read."
4,"Riveting, but too graphic","This book was quite interesting, giving a bird's eye view of a girl who is molested by her father. While the book was interesting, it was sometimes too graphic."
2,Desperately needs larger font and photos.,"I am a geologist, but for heaven's sake, pics at least as good as a cheap field guide would be in order, especially for some of the more unusual minerals. Would also love to see some of the zillions of examples of granites that you can find at your average kitchen type granite center. The geology though is good, just a bit dry."
4,Works well,This is just what I needed -- it's very warm and thick fleece. Although I ordered the 4T-5T for my 3.5 year old and she floats in it -- So they do run a little big. She wears this most nights over the past few weeks and the 2nd week it developed a small hole in the leg seam. But overall it's a great 'wearable blanket' for smaller children that are too big for regular sleepsaks but still cannot manage to keep their covers on at night. I sleep better knowing she's warm in her bed with or without her covers.
5,Mommy and Baby love her SleepSack,"This is our third SleepSack. My daughter has worn one since she was born, and we just keep moving up in size as she outgrows them. She's now 20 months old, and she calls it her ""sack"" and won't sleep without it. The one time I tried to get her to sleep without it because it was so warm, she kept trying to pull the sheet up over her, thinking it was her SleepSack.It's durable; it washes well; stains come out easily. We just love everything about it."
5,supernatural review,I received my purchase in a very timely fashion. I thought it was very cheap considering the number of episodes. I was very happy with the purchase.
4,Great Show,"I watched this as a promo, so I didn't spend money on it, I probably wouldn't spend money on something like this in the future either, but it's a good show."
5,Supernatural Season 3,"Supernatural Season 3 on DVD was great. There were lots of extras, along with the actual episodes. Great for anyone who is a fan."
5,Amaazzzed,It was brand new in pkg...the item was in excellent condition! Another extremely happy Amazon.com shopper! :)
4,Hard to meet expectations,"...but I think this episode does well enough. Although S2 didn't end with the sort of cliffhanger that S1 did, there were certainly a number of plot threads viewers would be expecting to see raised. Most of them are. The effect of the hellgate being opened, Bobby's increasing partnership with the Winchesters, the fallout from Dean's deal, and the fallout from their mixed success at the hellgate are all addressed while raising expectations for what's to come."
1,Flawed Blu-ray,"Great Season (which includes the outstanding 'A Very Supernatural Christmas').One huge complaint with the Blu-ray edition: There is no menu -- other than a pop-up, which can only be accessed after the first episode of each disc is already playing. Very annoying if you're looking to play a specific episode. Unlike the DVDs of Seasons 1 & 2 (which go straight to the main menu, offering a list of the episodes featured on each disc), the Blu-ray discs of Season 3 begin to play the first episode straight off, forcing you to have to hit pause, then bring up the pop-up menu to find the episode you're looking for."
5,LOVE IT,This is my favorite season of Supernatural and this bluray version is BEAUTIFUL!!! BEST SHOW ON TV!!! Friggin amazing.
3,"Good season, not the best DVD release","Supernatural is simply an excellent show, with talented actors and outstanding writing. However, I think that the DVD release of this season was the worst. There were no episodes commentary; instead we got small sections of superficial comments by different people. The bloopers part was simply not funny; it seemed they looked for a lot of snapshots of the actors saying I'm sorry and making faces. Maybe it is me, but I do not find that funny. On the positive side, we get the chance to watch again, without any commercial interruptions, excellent episodes like Mystery Spot. I hope the next season, is up to season 2 standards."
5,Excellent collection!,"This is the second Dave Mallett CD that I've added to my collection. After hearing ""This Town,"" released in 1993, I had my hopes up for something fantastic when this one hit the shelves. I wasn't disappointed! This crafty songwriter has done it again. The theme of sadness, loss, and lonliness runs the duration of the CD. It almost seems like Mallett was in a dark place himself, when he wrote these songs; the theme matches the title, ""...In The Falling Dark."" ""It Wasn't Supposed To Be Like That,"" co-written with Hal Ketchum, is a beautiful ballad and probably one of the best songs on the CD. Other cuts worth noting are ""Closer To Truth,"" ""That Was The One,"" ""Here We Go,"" ""Come Out Of The Blue,"" and ""Daddy's Oldsmobile,"" also co-written by Hal Ketchum. Also, the lyrics are included on the insert. Buy it before it's too late!!"
4,good walker - light weight,"The walker is lightweight but difficult to close - hoping it loosens up with use. THe brake handles are very large I would expect them to be smaller and easier to grip and close-luckily my mother is able to squeeze them, I could barely reach the brake handle.It was very easy to assemble - good thing as the instruction manual was useless.THe seat back was missing a dowel, will contact the seller and see how customer service is.The walker is sturdy and the extra bags and basket will be handy"
4,Great for a Wrestler,"In my personal opinion, Chris Jericho (AKA Moongoose McQueen) is a great vocalist and can definately hit those high notes. Fozzy could be mistaken for a late 80's or early 90's rock band. The music is something that appeals to more than WWE fans. I guess they are doing a good job since a 15 year old like me loves them!"
4,Welcome to...Fozzy IS Metal!,"In a time when the term ""Metal"" is more about rapping and less about vocal talent, it's is nice to see a band like Fozzy, a band that is proud of it's Metal roots and stands up for them. Sure it's a cd full of cover songs, but at least it's fun to listen to as opposed to being in a state of depression after listening to nameless other groups. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is longing for what Metal once was and not what it has become."
5,yeah baby,this cd rules and if your a metal fan or a wrestling fan you need to get it. chris jericho is such a good singer and all the covers on this cd are better than the people who did the song they covered. metal is jericho!!!
5,Not Just A Wrestler...,"The lead singer of Fozzy is not just wrestler Chris Jericho, he a great vocalist. He gaind popularity as a wrestler, and now he is using his fame to do something else he always wanted to do. As I listen to over the mountain, I don't just notice the singing, there is a great band behind the Jericho and they rock two! Do buy this just because you love wrestling, buy this because you love great music. This is great music made greater!"
2,it doesn't help,"I looking for the Usb data cable work for my cellphone motorola krzr k1m ,but the software included with the USB doesn't have my cellphone model so I can't use it,and the usb i recieved look different than what I saw and odered."
2,Wasn't Very Funny,This performance just wasn't up to the standard that Williams has done in the past. I was disappointed because I think he is a great comedian.
1,just bad,"Katt looked like he had no idea what he was gonna say up there, and if id have heard ""this is 20-12 damnit!"" One more time i'd have pulled my hair out. Should have used the one set he used for just about every other set he's ever done. At least it was funny"
2,Egh...,"As a fan of Katt Williams, I really anticipated the release of this stand up performance. It came highly recommended by friends, but its safe to say I was disappointed. Although it did have its funny moments, it often came off preachy and soap boxish."
3,Thank goodnes for downloading,"Normally I purchase DVDs rather than rent them because I like to watch them more than once. With this artist, however, one viewing is enough. Hope fully one day he will learne the meaning of OVERKILL"
3,It was okay,I thought Katt did okay in this dvd. He wasn't die hard funny but did just enough to keep me watching the entire show. His older stuff is definitely much funnier but I'd still go see him in concert.
3,Not a good resource for Southern gardeners,"Having recently purchased a condo in Houston with a north-facing porch, I eagerly awaited delivery of this book. However, I was quickly disappointed. This book should be titled ""Shade Gardening in the North,"" since virtually all of the plants listed are for Zones 5 and lower...not much help for my Zone 9 garden. It did contain a couple of pages of information for shade gardening in the South (which they consider to be North Carolina!), but I was really looking for specific information on the types of shade plants I could plant here. This would have been a great book if I lived in Ohio, but not so good for us Texans."
2,Not my favorite,"Ms. Rivenbark has a few moments of genuinely funny writing. But she seems so miserable as a wife and mother I wonder why she doesn't change her life instead of bitterly complaining about it? I wonder how her family feels about being painted in such a grim light. The writing style is repetitive, as well. How many times can you use the word ""whatchamacallit"" in one book?"
4,Southern Fried Humor,"This was a pretty funny account of southern euphimisms that I still hear floating around. Love her humor and the fact that she takes the bad with the good in all things southern related. I've also read her book ""Stop Dressing Your Six Year-Old Like A Skank,"" which was hilarious in itself. The names of the books give you a pretty good inclination of what's inside!"
2,Disgrace to the jungle community!,"Dieselboy is a much better dj than his last few attempts at mainstream cd's have shown! I have been a fan for a long time, and have heard many of his mixtapes, and seen hime live several times, and he used to be a lot more diverse. This cd is way to repetitive! No imagination! In his old stuff he would mix in different styles, use samples, juggle beats, but none of that really shows up here. Any decent dj could probably spin this set in his sleep!"
2,A Let Down! -From a long time fan!,"Being the long-time dieselboy fan that i am, i am very dissapointed with this. almost every drum loop, bass line, analog lead, etc. has been used IN A PREVIOUS DIESELBOY SONG! sometimes multiple loops from an old dieselboy remix are used identically in a new song. What a let down, getting all excited, running out to the record store to buy the newly released dieselboy album to find out that i could just listen to another of his albums to get the same effect. I would reccommend first-time dieselboy listeners to give it a try though, but you might want to first check out 97 octane, or soldier's story beforehand."
1,An audio insult,"1 star is too much. This is my first Dieselboy album and I have to say, looking at the cover from ""the no. 1 DnB artist"", I expected to find some top notch drum'n'bass. What I got is 193 beats per minute with no soul, no flavah, no personality, nothing. 70+ minutes of... Skip it. I *highly* recommend LTJ Bukem's 'Logical Progression: level 1' for an experience of DnB the way it ought to be."
4,RUST-OLEUM VINYL SPRAY PAINT FROM AMAZON,"THIS IS A GREAT VINYL PAINT FOR BOAT SEATS. FOR LARGE PROJECTS, THE SPRAY NOZZEL FAN IS TOO NARROW, THUS THE FOUR STARS. IT TAKES MORE PAINT AND LOOKS STREAKY. MY SOLUTION IN PAINTING THE LARGE SEATS IN MY PONTOON BOAT WAS TO FIND A DIFFERENT NOZZEL. SEMS VINYL SPRAY NOZZEL HAS A FINER AND WIDER FAN SPRAY. IT WILL INTERCHANGE WITH THE R.O. SPRAY CAN AND MAKE OVERLAPPING MUCH EASIER AND ELIMINATED THE STREAK LOOK WITH A LOT LESS PAINT. KEEP THE PAINT NOZZEL CLEAN WITH PAINT REMOVER. ALTHOUGH SEMS IS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE, IT IS WORTH BUYING ONE CAN IN YOUR COLOR TO GET A PROFESSIONAL NOZZEL FOR A PROFESSIONAL LOOK WITH THE R.O. VINYL SPRAY PAINT."
4,"Jack Fleming, art critic","Well my friends, it was good checking in to see what our famous vamprie is up to. I really enjoyed this book. Jack is up to his old tricks, but this time, he has entered the world of art. I highly suggest the book. It was a real page turner. If you start it, you won't put it down, and you won't be sorry. :O)="
2,Music Fan,The CD copy of the original recording is of such poor quality that I will not play the CD very often if at all.
3,Good Book,"As a glosary is very good, if you where aming to learn how to program a web service it was not very good for me. I would prefer more code samples from the basics to advanced. Definitely you should have a previous knowledge of XML, and maybe even some basic knowledge of webservices before reading this."
2,This book does not give insights on the topic,"This book apparently is intended for high-level managers and end-users of the technology, since it gives no technical details on how these technologies are used. That would be okay, except that at the managerial or end-user level I find the book to lack insight into what the technologies do or how they do them, at any level. Rather, it is mostly gives lists of ""things that happen"", with no logical connection from one thing to another, with no insight as to why this makes sense. It is like memorizing dry facts in a bad high school history class: yes, I could memorize them, but why, and who cares anyway?"
1,Poor quality shows,"Like their cars, these guys make cheap, poor-reliability products. The flat-panel TV seems a great deal at first. [Update: many other manufacturers now have lower-cost models that are better quality.] But after a couple weeks, you realize it cuts lots of corners. The picture gets fuzzy and blocky more than other LCD TV's; this is especially perceptible when you watch DVDs. The contrast is also pretty bad. Above all, my friend, this is a low-quality monitor made to work for no more than a couple months. You are just not getting your money's worth from this. For the same money or just a little bit more you can get a namebrand, Sharp, Panasonic, Envision... and many times better quality and enjoyment. Amen."
4,Good introduction and overview,"""Using SQL Server 7"" is a good book for beginners and still very useful when you got more experience. It describes the features clearly and also gives a lot of good examples. It's one of the best book about the SQL Server 7 I've seen."
3,Very Introductory,"This book is long on generalities and short on specifics and advanced topics. The most noticeable was the complete lack of information on interfaces with other database types, replication, external views, etc. If you need an introduction to SQL Server 7.0 the book is excellent. As titled, it leaves much to be desired."
5,EXCELLENT!!,"Buy it! An excellent overview of SQL Server. Chapter 3 has all the right questions to ask and answer before preparing to bring 7.0 in. Chapters 4, 10, 12, 14, and 16 should be REQUIRED reading for this product. Easy to read and understand... helps if you have SQL Server 7.0 installed and can walk through all the steps."
2,Cursory Reference,I found this to be a very cursory reference manual. It did not go into the depth and detail that I would have liked. This book is more geared to beginner/intermediate analysis of SQL Server 7.0. There is no help on DTS ( a huge component of 7.0)
3,Expected More,"For what it is, the Firefly Animal Rescue series is good, I suppose. I bought ""Birds of Prey"" and ""Rainforest Birds,"" but, I expected both to be a lot more interesting than they were. For educational purposes, they're fine, but I bought them out of curiosity and interest in wildlife, and found them lacking in entertainment value. Their photos were OK, but I've seen better."
3,Quality,"Although color and size are the same as the original plates I bought 15 years ago, the weight per single plate is less. Therefor I assume the quality of the bone china is not the original standard."
5,A Useful Reference,"This is a reference book, but it is readable as a history of Christianity as well. It is superbly organized and nearly universal in coverage. As a history of the cruelty and twisted logic that creeps into all religions, it is unique. The author is equally critical of all sides in disputes over doctrine. If you are a student of Christianity, you need this book."
1,Terrible,"I have had this phone for about 2 years and it is horrible. There is no reception, the battery dies after about an hour, and its impossible to send text messages. By far one of the worst phones out there."
3,Big Beat...,....Dance Floor if you like that sort of thing. A bit too in-your-face mixes for my taste.
1,When reach exceeds grasp,"This is what happens when a smart computer guy and his daughter start speculating about social and economic Y2K scenarios. While Ed Yourdon has technical expertise, the scenarios reflect a lack of depth outside of software metrics. In short, it is much like a ""bull"" session where a few smart people try to guess what may or may not happen with Y2K. Unfortunately, it is not nearly as entertaining or enjoyable. Yourdon has a dry style that leans towards smugness. The book becomes tiresome and offers few original insights. The only distinction of ""Time Bomb,"" it is one of the better Y2K-related books... of course, after you read some of the others you will realize this is faint praise indeed."
2,Desperately seeking Y2K sanity...,"I've been hoping for a book on Y2K which is rational, balanced, dispassionate and informative. When I saw that Ed Yourdon had weighed in on the subject I was hopeful, but unfortunately this is not that book.What we are treated to, in the midst of a well-organized overall framework, is a long list of ""could""s. This ""could"" happen, that ""could"" happen, yadda yadda. We all know that -- an airplane ""could"" fall on me while I'm typing this. The question we all want to know is -- ""Will it?"". And Yourdon gives us little to go on. This book contains a lot of speculation about potential consequences, and virtually nothing about the probability of the events occurring to begin with. At least Capers Jones has done some metric-based analysis of Y2K probabilities..... maybe the two of them should talk. END"
1,Ed's a charlatan,"Ed Yourdon is a well-known fake. Years ago, he wrote a book about how the entire US software industry was going to collapse. After it didn't, he had the nerve to write a sequel about how disaster was narrowly averted. Yawn.Then there was ""Death March"", where he discusses the problems many software projects face, only to say there is no hope and we are all doomed. Yawn again.Now, Ed has taken up Y2k as his latest cause. Nevermind all the money he is making from these books, his web page, consulting, speaking, etc. Nevermind he has glossed over facts, and circulated data from well-known Christian Reconstructionist Gary North. Nevermind he claimed that we'd be seeing massive Y2k problems by now in both domestic and foreign governments.No doubt Ed is already writing a sequel claiming that he helped avert a Y2k crisis. Yawn."

4,Timeless,"Timeless for those interested in understanding the political history of the 1850's and the issues leading up to the civil war. A knowledge of the 1840's and 50's in necessary, as well as of LIncoln and Douglas. One take away is just how good a writer and thinker Lincoln was, and the confidence in himself that he must have had to challenge Douglas to one on one debates. Lincoln, like Winston Churchill had the ability to write clearly and make himself understood in a way few other great leaders are able to."
2,Not as good as traditional arepas...,"I find that the arepas made w/the arepa maker come out w/""rubbery"" centers, and they take a long time to be done. They toast nicely outside, but somehow the insides don't cook well. I'm wondering if I can find another use for this appliance, maybe for making pancakes? I think I will continue making arepas the traditional way, on a non-stick griddle on the stove."
1,arepas cooker better by hand,"I purchased the oster arepas cooker thinking it would be just what I needed, after countless failures and changing receipes to adapt to the cooker I finally did them by hand on a griddle to absolute perfection...the problem I found with the cooker is it was too hard on outside and still raw on inside. The cooker itself sounds like a good idea with premeasured areas but never could get the inside done, they are supposed to be moist but not like clay."
4,The arepa maker makes the breakfast easy,"Mientras cocinas a la vez 6 bellas arepas facil y rapidamente, tienes la oportunidad de preparar el resto del desayuno y en menos de 15 minutos tienes un completo desayuno listo."
2,Overpriced and a whole cd of previously released material!,"For the sticker price, we should get more than the same old Elvis recycled once again. The booklet was also disappointing -- not much info and mediocre pictures."
1,NOT a comprehensive Carmen Amaya + Sabicas collection,"The CD is actually titled ""Carmen Amaya: Amaya's & Sabicas"". It has 7 historical Carmen Amaya numbers accompanied by Juan Maya Marote etc. (no Sabicas), then 4 with Amaya+Sabicas from Decca DL 9925 (Garrotin, Cuando pa Chile me voy, Columbianas, Sevillanas; the first 2 are somewhat poorly mastered) then 4 historical non-flamenco Sabicas tunes which are part of P 1011 on the Planet label. If you like Sabicas rocking with an alto sax, one of these last four is just what you were looking for. Or perhaps you would prefer Sabicas's immortal tremolo solo. One saving grace, the times given in the track listings are wrong for tracks 8-11, the bands on the CD are full-length. Enuf said. A ripoff, basically."
3,Cute show,So I love all things British add a few handsome characters and some pretty good acting and I am all in. This show is tough and cheek. Deals with Vampires and werewolves and ghosts. Just some good old fun on the tele.
3,Daring to Be Different,This book has very good information and ideas. The ideas that are in this book are creative and original. I enjoyed how this book had many analogies that corresponded with what the author was trying to imply. My favorite chapter is the Muralist and Monarch chapter. This chapter was very inspirational and made the reader think of what they would want their mural to be. Another part of the book I really thought was good was the part of why new managers fail. It made sense and it is true. I did enjoy this book I thought it was very inspirational to the reader and would encourage people who plan on becoming to be leaders to read it!!
2,Not what I expected,"I like looking at old pictures and old letters, but I thought when I bought the book that I would actually be looking in the history of someone's life with pictures to go with it but that was not the case. It is just a random bunch of pictures and a random bunch of letters put together in a book. The pictures aren't necessarily the pictures of the people who wrote the letters, so you know nothing of the authors, no explanation of the times they lived in or the place they lived in or anything. In other words, no story behind it whatsoever. Just a disappointing collection."
1,Boring!,"I bought it after reading the words of praise from other writers, most notably from Arthur C. Clarke, whose comments on the front cover put him on par with Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein? You gotta be kidding me! Now I wonder if this was the same Arthur C. Clarke of the Space Odyssey fame or some guy whose name is the same as Mr. Clarke and was paid a dollar to write those words.Save your money and buy a bottle of Extra Strength Tylenol instead. It'll help you with books by other writers like Mr. Williamson."
4,Atmospheric trip through the fair.,"This is a highly atmospheric trip through Carnival life. I wish that the relationship between Frankie and Patch had been fleshed out more to show how they entered their peculiar double-act, but a fascinating double-act it is. Robbie Robertson isn't so much an actor, more he is a tantalising presence - broodingly sexual in contrast with Busey's lecherous attitude. Jodie Foster gave a surprisingly mature performance. I've never seen Taxi Driver, so for me the effect of seeing Donna's Baptism by Fire into Carny life was chilling and powerful. This VHS is let down by the muddy audio - the DVD issue can't come soon enough! But overall, this movie is watchable. It's heartening that Robbie Robertson brought some real knowledge of Carny life from his teens. It's hard not to swoon at him though! Good film."
3,other reviews don't do film justice,"Carny is an excellent movie and it is much deeper than many think. It is not a classic ""freak"" show kind of movie, it actualy has quite a good plot. You get to know the characters pretty well and it makes you miss these types of carnival shows. They don't have 'em anymore. I reccomend this film to anyone who likes late 70's early 80's obscure films..."
3,"""And introducing the Bomb Song and The Acid Commercial"" (from back of album)","Country Joe and The Fish/ I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-To-Die: A favorite group of the radical left in the 1960's, this album really didn't sell until after the Woodstock movie came out. Apart from the title track, this wasn't as radical an album as their early EPs were, in fact this album is rather tame. To get Country Joe and The Fish at their early radical best, I suggest the ""Collector's Item - The first three EPs"" CD over this album."
3,An excellent but very basic flash unit,"I bought this to use with my Canon Rebel XT (350D) and it performs very well balancing itself with ambient light using the ETTL-II system. I was very pleased with the results both indoors and out. The only drawbacks are 1) slow recycle times - takes at least a few seconds even with fully charged batteries 2) no swivel capability. Those two features are a must for pros or serious amateurs. This flash is really as basic as it gets but if you don't need to bounce light off a surface other than the ceiling, or take multiple exposures in quick succession that this flash would be a good purchase (for a Canon SLR/DSLR)."
4,Super Strong Spring!!!,"I bought this for use with a four foot FireStik II on a FireStik hood channel mount. It works well with these items... My only complaint is that it may be too strong of a spring. It's very hard to get it to bend at all. I feel like the mounting plate flexes more than the spring! However, that may change as time goes on. Overall I'm satisfied."
1,Black and Decker Leaf Hog,"This is the second iteration of this appliance. Although the idea is great, the design is poor. The old type worked OK until the zipper on the bag failed after about 100 loads. The new type, with the slide in bag is not an improvement. The frame into which the bag slides is made of very thin plastic and cannot support the weight of the bag even half-full. The result is the bag falls off, blowing mulch all over the place. If all you have to pick up is a handful of leaves, this will do quite nicely. If you have an average-sized yard (75' x 150') forget it. It will fail after 15-20 loads."
5,Check out the review where he empties from wrong end,"It's absolutely hysterical! Another reviewer is complaining because he's emptying the bag from the nozzle end,NOT the zippered end! Lol!Anyway,awesome machine in every way! Love it! Just watch the area's with rocks,like the lawn.Go easy & keep the suction end slightly higher than the lawn,to where it is barely sucking up the leaves.Lots of hidden rocks below grass surface! Fun to use & does a thorough & complete job of mulching & sucking up the leaves & other debris,like paper & plastic bags etc.Enjoy!"
4,Outstanding!,This book was very helpful. It was clear and easy to follow. I feel confident that my skills in using the Twi language has improved.
4,Good technique,"I enjoy Michael Colgans books. This isn't one of his best, but it has some good strength training info. As an endurance athelete I found this book moderately useful."
3,Useful though sometimes unclear,"I like the book, but wish it were better written. The author obviously has knowledge--unfortunately he does not always clearly communicate that knowledge. Nevertheless, on the strength of those parts that ARE clear, I do recommend this book. Colgan suggests some excellent exercises; he also shows particular stretches that, he advises, should never be attempted. Such information justifies owning this book as a permanent reference. Indeed, this is a good book that, with basic care in its writing, could have been a great book.This book contains valuable information, despite its shortcomings in writing and illustration. If you intend to start (or continue) training with weights, read this book first. It could help you avoid some training injuries."
5,Palm Z22,"It is wonderful! Easy to learn, easy to operate...I would HIGHLY recommend it to everyone............"
5,Great for going paperless,"I have owned my palm pilot z22 for over 2 years. I used to keep it with my all the time, then put it to the side about a year ago as I got tired of carrying my phone & z22. But I picked it up a few months ago again, trying to go paperless and it has done the trick! It has my grocery list, my ""to-do"" list, cd's I want to buy, calendar, notes & memos all in one place and none of it has to be written on paper! I am also impressed at how much it can be used and go between charges. I am not a very techy person so this is great for me!"
1,"Rambling, undocumented","In the Preface, Page x, Kogelschatz says, ""This is not a scholarly treatise, rife with footnotes and references to bore you....""Indeed, the book is not a scholarly treatise. In the notes Kogelschatz cites two websites and three books. There is no bibliography.Kogelschatz wanders aimlessly from his thesis implied in the sub-title of the book: ""What the Translators Didn't Want You To Know."" He not only does little to support his thesis, even without any thorough documentation, he also makes some claims that are debatable to say the least.I doubt that this work would get a passing mark even at the high school level.Oh, well. I bought this book based on its title. It in no way lives up to that title."
1,A huge disappointment,"THE HARD NUT's reputation preceded its arrival in my DVD collection, an apparently iconic production that supposedly changed the way we view THE NUTCRACKER. What a disappoinment! It fails to pass muster in every conceivable way: I found it to be void of wit, grace and invention; the ""humour"" is laboured and unfunny; and what may have seemed like a nice idea emerges, in the event, as heavy-handed, vulgar and, worst of all, poorly danced and boring. If you want a re-invented NUTCRACKER, try Matthew Bourne's. And there is nothing wrong with the tried-and-tested: Balanchine's for NYCB, Baryshnikov's for ABT, or Peter Wright's for The Royal Ballet still stand the test of time. Mr Morris' ballet, on the other hand, is more The Emperor's New Clothes than THE NUTCRACKER redefined."
2,One Great Song - Wind,"I purchased this album when it first came out, for one song: ""Wind"". It remains one of my favorites, but the other songs have not aged as well. If you are purchasing this album for the Jerry Jeff Walker tunes, well, skip it."
2,Ya' gotta try it.,"I bought this disc based on a tune I heard on Sirius radio. The name of the song was ""Wind"", and it was just great. Now, if you listen to the rest of this disc, it sounds completely dated in the 60's. But, the one tune is worth the price of the disc (at least to me), and it's hard to believe it's even on the same disc. Be adventurous, give it a try, or at least get the one song. I've read other reviews that say the same thing, so we can't ALL be wrong. Enjoy."
1,bummer not album amazon system.,"I bought this looking for a single track from a danish 70's singer. I ended up with this album. It could be good, but the amazon tracking system zapped me and told my track was on here."
5,YES YES YES YES YES YES YES!,"THIS IS THE ONE. There is absolutely nothing about law school that this book doesn't cover. I'm blown away. I use the briefing method described in the book, I followed the suggestions regarding interviewing and taking the Bluebook exam, etc. etc. I've had this book since my senior year of college and out of the hundreds of dollars I have spent on books these past two years of law school, ""Law School Confidential"" was the single smartest purchase I have made. It may actually be my best book purchase ever."
3,Current law student,"I was not very impressed with this book. This is even more true as I continue my legal education. The advice for those thinking of going to law school seemed like common sense. Some of the 1L information was good but a lot does not really apply unless you are going to a school similar to those the 'mentors' attended. Other items that they say will help you get ahead just seem like shortcuts that will probably burn you in the long run.Most people applying to law school need a reality check. This book is good for that element. Law school is a lot of work, a lot of debt, and a lot of pressure. It is not a golden ticket to a six-figure income.If you really feel unprepared or just want to know what you are getting yourself into then talk to current law students, young lawyers (the experience has chance from even 10 years ago) and the admissions people at diffferent schools. I would not buy this book again, I'd get it from the library and save the money for other things."
3,The Kindle Typo's ruined my experience.,"This is a good book, but reading it on Kindle was far from enjoyable. It begins in the book's forward, the word ""die"" appears where the word ""the"" should be. I thought, that is okay, easy enough to deal with. However, as you get deeper into the book, the typo's become more cryptic and more frequent. I love my Kindle, but you are better off reading this in hardcopy."
4,One of the best Law school helpers out there,"I really liked the premise of the book and its an easy read. Alot of people gripe about the authors' tips and ""ego,"" but all the tips really do help. This book is a whole lot better than Montauk's book and this book gives you the straight facts. Buy this book and pack it with you!"
4,The Ultimate Law School Guide!,"This book was everything to me as an entering 1L. It really laid the realities of law school down so there were no surprises. One thing I disliked is that it did not really give a guide as to second semester of law school, which was disappointing."
4,Very realistic,"Read this book before you even think of going to law school! I annotated the entire thing and read it over thoroughly before considering law school (even though I had discussed it thoroughly with friends, admission officers AND my bosses - who are attorneys because I work for a law firm!)."
1,Waste of money.,"If you need such sage advice as 'buy your books before classes start' or 'buy a comfortable bed' then this book is for you. For a better introduction to the study of law I recommend ""Introduction to the Study & Practice of Law in a Nutshell""."
1,Try something else!,"I got this video because I read so much about it here on amazon.com. And then when I saw it I was really bummed out. My kids watched a few images and then lost interst right away!We have the Babyfaith series (God Made Me) and my kids love that! It's awesome!This Baby Miracle seemed like a wanna-be Baby Einstein without the quality or the creativity. Bummer! Perhaps the images would work better for older children. Very low quality. The presentation of the bible story is not very good at all either, despite their claims. My advice - try something else!"
4,It worked,"Had a mechanical failure on my laptop hard drive. Put in a new one, and used the Rescue Disk that came with the software.Had to restart the disk a few times till the LINUX software on the disk was comfortable, and then transferred all the files to the new HD.My only complaint - and it really frustrated me - is that the Rescue Disk seemed to think that my USB port was a USB-1, rather than the (much_) speedier USB-2. The total backup of 120G took more than 25 hours.After 25 hours though, my laptop started normally."
4,beautiful pictures!,"A wonderfully illustrated book with bright and engaging pictures. My daughter loves to slide the flaps and see the numbers pop up. A great learning tool for number recognition and counting, and fun pictures to boot!"
4,Toddler loves to turn the dial.,This is a cute little book. You turn the little dial and the number pops up at the top. My son (12 months) loves to turn the dial on each page. It's his new favorite book - which is pretty high praise.
5,Excellent Product,"It works as advertized. With the use of this cable, the HDTV pictures were fantastic."
4,good cable for the money,"I bought three of these cable from amazon and two of them came in a wrong color so I returned them and kept one. After using it for 2 days, these cable seem okay, not execellent but what more can you ask for with this kind of price tag. To make things short, these cable will work with the new hdmi 1.3. Not the best I'd use, I actually have other $$$ hdmi cable and it outperforms it in terms of color, sharpness and overall built quality. But is it worth the extra $$$ for more expensive hdmi cable, to me yes, to others might be no. honestly it does not have that much of a difference from other expensive hdmi cable. Some people wear a timex and some people wear a rolex, I think they both are pretty accurate. So you be the judge."
1,Cheap,Holds the ipod nicely but doesnt attach the window well. Every turn or bump in the car and the ipod went flying. It was a good deal but i guess you get what you pay for.
5,Great Book,"Totem Magic: Dance of the Shapeshifter by Yasmine Galenorn was a very interesting book to say the least. I really liked this book. This book give a very interesting viewpoint ob totem animals, spirit guides, and other animal entries and energies. Not only does the book give the read ways to find their animal totems and spirits, the book also give various practices and ways that they can be worked into spells and magic workings. One every interesting and, in my view, great thing about this book is that it does not say what an animal means or symbolizes and leaves that up to the read to find out for themselves. This book goes into how one might develop a relationship with their own totem or guide and learn for themselves what their own symbolism, which I found to be wonderful. I found this book to be genuinely fascinating and one that was really a pleasure to read."
3,"Pretty good, but a little slow...","It's a pretty good story, but the plot is very slow. In Conan Doyle's novels there was a lot of deduction from the beginning to the end of each story. In this book, everything clears up in the last chapter... so the rest of the book is pretty slow paced: there's action but no idea of where Lupa's (Holmes son) getting at."
5,Return to old form,"Finally, Redman has returned. I was a huge fan of his 1st and 2nd albums back in the day and was disappointed by his albums after that. Given all of the mindless hip-hop that is dominating the radio, it is nice to see someone with real skills return to the scene. This is definitely a worthwhile purchase if you like real lyricists; if not, go buy Unk or Dem Franchise Boys and watch your brain cells deteriorate."
1,Is there anything less than 1 star?,"Bought for 88 Ford F150 Lariat and Pioneer stereo. The tabs didn't line up with the holes in the dash and then the dash trim would not fit on top of the bracket and the 1 Din Pioneer stereo didn't fit in the provided brackets (stereo was much too small). I would send back, but it's completely hacked up.I do not recommend this for any 87-92 Ford F150."
2,Was hoping for more...,"The dial of this watch is decent. Not spectacular, but reasonably pleasing to the eye. The case is terrible though... it is far too THICK. This makes it look and feel low quality. This definitely strikes me a $100 watch. The $495 ""suggested price"" they're claiming is just silly. As usual, if you expect more than you pay for you'll be left displeased."
1,A great book!,"I pulled this book off the shelf in our house and was suprised how much i enjoyed it! I actually read it for an English porject for 10th grade. I wish there were some other reviews of this book that were more critical because that's what i needed for the project...too bad, it is too good a book to say anything bad about it!!"
1,Do Yourself A Favor...,...do not buy this book unless you have to for a class (like I had to). Obscure and incomplete examples are the order of the day. (refer to the comments about Johnsonbaugh's Discrete Mathematics book - they apply to both books - I'm trudging through that disaster now). Buy the Bjarne Strousup C++ book instead.
2,Didn't work for me,"Strainer looks okay and arrived quickly, but does not seal my sink. Stopper is too shallow. Not worth trouble returning."
2,Not for Most People,"If you are a DJ and are looking for some tracks to mix, buy this CD. If you have heard Tenaglia's Global Underground CDs and are looking for more of the same, don't look here. I wasted my money."
2,At least the cover is appealing!,"But like the CD's cover photo, taken from the back of the plane, this un-mixed selection is far from first-class. As many other reviewers suggest, do not expect ""Global Underground"" or ""Back to Basics"" grooves. I was expecting more from the ""Headhunter"" track as well. It's o.k., but lacks originality and personality, and sounds more like the original Front 242 version played through a kazoo. If you buy this CD, get it used, and don't pay very much."
2,forbidden ecstasy,was a loooong read. not as good as first two. after grey eagle is shot by scout you hear nothing more about him until the end. felt scouts death should have be by grey eagle and gordon should have suffered more.
3,A good sequel,I thought this book was okay. It is the 3rd sequel out of 6 in a set. I had first read Brazen Ecstasy (the 4th book)years ago not realizing it was a sequel. When I realized there were more I bought the whole set and started from the beginning. With this book I became frustrated when Alisha and Gray Eagle were separated but what kept me going was there true love through all their hardships and knowing that they would eventually live happily ever after.
4,Really Great cd but...,THey don't show the full extent of their awesomeness in this cd like they do in resistance. Still a great buy!
2,Two Thumbs Down,"I would not recommend this book. It deals almost entirely with basic AWT programming, and if that isnt bad enough, nearly ignores the (lame, but useful in this context) screen development tools in J++. The chapter on mutithreading is useful, but all-in-all you can spend your money much more wisely."
3,Not so Bad,"Unlike the other reviewer, *sheesh what a vicious writeup* I never thought Elrods books were that bad. Fleming isn't her best series, her other is actualy better, but that doesn't mean that this one isn't somewhat entertaining. I partly like it because I found some of it's triteness to be funny, and I like it better than some books because of it's 'vampire theory' where you don't nessisarily become a vampire just because you were bitten. So if you're looking for an easy read and a desent laugh, this book is ok. Otherwise, I'd say L.K. Hamilton. She's pretty good."
1,Yuck!,"This book defies description, it so bad. The dialogue is trite, the characters shallow, and the writing amateur. Sorry, Elrod, maybe you should go back to your day job. I'm ashamed I have bought all of Elrod's book on the advice of another author at Uncommon Con in Dallas/Fort Worth last year. I'm beginning to think she was in cahoots with Elrod to sell books for each other."
1,Takemitsu Discovers Reverb,"I was excited to have a complete solo guitar recording of Takemitsu,s work. The recording quality of this work , however is very painful to listen to.Drenched in ambient reverb from the church in Sweden and one track from a concert hall in Germany, one has to dig through a virtual wall of sonic sludge to hear Takemitsu,s brilliant arrangements/compositions.This is a real as shame as the guitarist , Franz Halasz has a masterful command of his instrument and the material at hand. Hopefully someone will record this body of work so we can enjoy listening and not feel like the performance took place at a high school gymnasium.Peter C. Cavano"
4,Excellent Review,"The chapters are written as review articles, and are good background reading for current literature. Easy to read with summaries at the end. Recommended."
5,"The essence of ""Real""","There are many ways that love rises to the surface in our lives. It can come disguised as questions and as answers, as both comfort and discomfort--- often simultaneously. The essential elements that fill in the spaces between the beats of the heart are not only in dreams and fairytales, but in real life in all of its messy, yet perfect glory. Gene Michael Best captures these emotions beautifully."
1,"Not worth the $$$$, aggravation & lack of compassion.",These machine break and chances are they'll break right after the warranty ends. You pay to have it fixed. Good chance it'll break again. You pay to have it fixed again. It breaks again. Guy that's hired to fix them for Capresso does nothing and sends it back to you broken. No accountability. No follow-up. You send it back again. It comes back still broken. You'll spend your days chasing them and then they'll send the machine back to you broken. Worst of all they don't care if you just spent a thousand dollars for their painted plastic. You're SOL. Expensive novelty item. This latest round has me re-introducing myself to the local barista for three (3) weeks and counting. Enjoy it while you can.
4,"Great machine, if you can afford repairs!","I LOVE the coffee this machine makes, but as other reviewers have also expressed, the cost of repairs hardly seems worth spending that much money on a ""coffee center"" no matter how good the coffee is! The capresso company could care less if you just sent the machine in to get ""fixed"" for the same problem for which it was just at their site...it's quite a lot of money for repairs. Luckily, my husband and I got so fed up that he took the machine apart himself and figured out what the problem was and can now fix it himself...thank my lucky stars that he's inclined mechanically!"
1,Capresso machines not dependable,I will have to agree with Danny. I have the c3000 machine and it has broken 3 times with the same problem. It has been fixed under warranty 2 of those times and broke again after 1 use. I have seen blogs that say from their own technicians that they have problems with all of their refurbished items. The products are way over price and don't live up to their name. They will not get any recomendations from me.
5,Cry the Night ........... Molly's Reviews,"Well fleshed, potent characters each have their own particular disposition. Twists and turns keep the reading guessing in this tale of a monster created by the derangement of a parent. Specific details of the murderer's life are set down in fantasy, dreams, memories and loathsome actions by an almost sixty year old man who might be any one of the several fellows fitting that description who live in the area.Not for the faint of heart, nor for a dark and stormy night when you are home alone."
1,Bored before 24!,"I agree that the prologue was excellent, but it was downhill from there. I struggled to continue, but by page 24, I ""couldn't take no-more"". Don't waste you time."
1,Piece of trash,This piece of garbage is just as bad as the game Medievil. The two could be interchangable. I think that they copied directly from Medievil. Super boring unless you're 5 years old. Use the CD for a frisbee if you waste your money on it.
4,Perfect for SLIDE players,I ordered this set of strings for my man & he promptly put it on his Fender Stratoblaster and played around with it.He was a skeptic because he'd never tried this brand before and he's a guy who is loyal to his brands (and his woman) so his words were:I tried my Dunlop Mudslide & my aluminum slides on it with the neck position pickup on and it was just amazing! It also worked well with the other pickups and styles too but it just seemed to take to slide like a moth to a flame.
2,Bosch plug wires,"Since the Ford Contour is based on an European designed Ford platform, I expected Bosch to be a good choice. Ended up getting MotorCraft wires later when these did not perform very well."
4,Well Written Introduction into Options,"Jon Najarian provides a well written introduction into options trading and an inside glimpse of a major trading firm. The hard work he put in to be successful and the pressure for a major trading firm were enlightening and easy to ready. The book has become dated with the advent of online trading. I am hopeful that Najarian will write an update as I will be first in line to buy it. Still well worth the money, and it will give you a sobering insight into the disadvantage the private investor has versus the big firms."
4,Absolutely Yummy!,"This book is simply delicious. It is all about the South, it has warm family memories, it has humor, eccentric relatives, and best of all RECIPES. The author has a delightful way of describing things. I give it 4 stars only because I think it's a little ""over the top"" and a bit precious what with all the droll relatives and wacky situations - a bit ""Andy Griffith Show"" only further South. But this is a very very entertaining piece of work, and I am determined to try making fried chicken one last time before winter comes and I have to keep all the windows closed!"
3,What??? No subtitle capability?,"It will take months of watching these Brits (mumbling in upper-class accents) to figure out what they're saying. It's so disappointing to have no subtitle capability. I/we are spoiled enough by this time to presume all movies in the English language, can in fact, be understood, by those of us who speak English (or maybe American?) Have we missed something here?"
4,Fair Adaptation of the Book,"I have been a fan of the book since it first come out, having read it well over a dozen times. I was eager to purchase the video adaptation once it came out on DVD. Overall, I was pleased.The miniseries is a fairly faithful adaptation of the book, with some scenes taken word for word from the printed page. In other cases, changes are made to the storyline -- in some cases to advance the plot quickly, in others for no apparent reason. However, the general plot of the book is retained.My major quibble with the series is its casting. Jeffery Archer's description of his major characters was detailed, and in most cases the actors do not resemble the characters in the book. This was the major drawback for me, but I doubt it will matter to any but avid fans of the original.All told, I recommend this miniseries."
4,Fascinating look into British politics.,"I did like this dvd series a lot . The only reason I gave it 4 stars was that the first two episodes of this series were hard to get through, rather dull and boring, but after that it was quite interesting. I agree it was a bit hard to discern some of the dialogue, and I had to turn up the sound level and repeat some scenes to catch what was said.Now when I look at the House of Commons and the Prime Minister's question periods with them I will have a more informed understanding of their political system."
5,Sci-Fi Without The Typical Sci-Fi Story,"For the reviewers who complain about the price or the storyline; Atleast you are watching the show, which means you enjoy it on many levels. I was very skeptical at first when I heard none of the original cast was going to be on the show. Then I was surprised and blown away by Richard Hatch's performance as Tom Zarek in season one and season two. He truly is an amazing actor and brings depth to the council of twelve.For in-depth details about this season look at the reviews above. All I can add is the story so far is wonderful and headed in a great direction. I look forward to seasons 3,4,5, etc and even the spin-off ""Caprica"".You owe it to yourself as a Sci-Fi fan to buy this and it's previous season."
4,Very good SciFi,This is pretty good. Along with Stargate probably only good SciFi being made at the moment.
5,A quick update on the pricing,I loved the show but not the splitting of the season into 2.0 and 2.5 effectively doubling the price of the original series (which also included the feature length pilot). I held off and found 2.0 and 2.5 at Target for $39.99. For once Amazon is not the cheapest option. The value pack released on May 8th and should be available from a number of other retailers.
1,Terrible Service,"Terrible service and return policy. Make sure the part is the exact one you need, I bought a antenna for 40$, got back $25 after they applied a 'restocking' fee. Ye be warned!"
1,Quit working,"I have used this power antenna for just 6 months and today it just quit working, I can here it clicking but the antenna won't move............. Just 6 months!"
4,Very good,Installation was not so good because the adapters did not fit the contour of the rear fender of an 88 Camry. Other than that the performance so far is good after a year. I would give it a 5 star if it came with better adapter. I had to used some old hardware to make it fit.
4,O YEAH!,Great remixes! This would be great for a party! i love the music especially The Only Differnce Between Martrydom And Suicide Is Press Coverage is da best! Some songs r crappy but some r just so good. I say buy it but from itunes because it is cheeper.
1,Horrible,this was a horrible item.....the case doesnt fit........the clip was broken........all around not worth it!!!!!!!!
1,What a load of nosense!,"I remember I used to see here on LIZZIE McGUIRE. Yea, that was a fun show, but now Her and her TERRIBLE voice has struck the starlight again. Yes, she's a hot babe but she writes the MOST REDICULOUS songs ever. ""Wake up Wake up on a saturday night""? ""London, Paris, maby Tokyo""? Tokyo is cool! So why ""mabye""? This is just gay!"
5,"Funny, well-told story!","The introduction at the La Jolla bookstore said it all: cross between John Berendt and Ken Kesey, or carl Hiassen and Vince Bugliosi -- or as he put it, reminiscent of Mark Twain."
5,Classic,"This is one of those classic games that everyone who was a fan of Playstation 1 must own, aside from the 1st Tomb Raider of course. Got it used, but it works great."
2,go with something a little better,This thing takes FOR EVER TO LOAD!!! (5-20 min)It also has no maps so dont count on trying to find trails or what route to take! The screen also has no back light so it in hard to use at night! The plus side is that it is very small and light and is good for starters.
5,A Beautiful Story,"I've seen this movie at least a half dozen times and love it every time. I never read the book, so I can't make a comparison but in the movie, I love the evolvution of the character of Willie throughout the story.Besides being a heartwarming animal flick, it is a wonderful story about community."
2,Allergic to oily beans,"I have had my machine now for about 4 years. During that time, I have had to send in my machine not once but twice for a full service (at 250.00 a shot). My problem each time was that the beans were clogging the machine (malfunction 8). And while this sounds like an easy fix and maybe something that you can do at home...such is not the case..! The VERY nice customer service tell me that my bean choice is the problem, but I guess I don't get how you can pull a shot of espresso with a non-oily bean. espresso beans are- by nature kinda oily. They suggested that I spread out my beans on a paper towel to absorb the excess oil...and I'm thinking what? for 2k for an automatic machine, I am needing to de-oil my beans? That's not so automatic..."
1,"Total scam, I'll never buy this again",I bought this machine from Amazon.com. It actually never worked good. All advices from customer support were a crap. It produces weak coffee at any settings and maintenance costs are crazy. I did my best to solve the problem but finally will have to sell it cause now I'm in despair.
4,4+ years of great service,"This machine is excellent. Produces above average espresso on every shot. Foams milk well too.I was an early buyer of this machine, and 8,513 shots later (yes it counts them), I know it is an excellent value.I also would comment that the customer service is excellent. Sent in the machine once, and for $100.00 received a complete overhaul. (Sent in for a pump leak after a house move.) Came back like new, on time, and they paid for the return shipping. Can't ask for much more.I will buy another super auto, from Jura/Capresso, when the time comes for a new machine. It might be many years from now..."
4,Konitz Espresso Cups,"A sturdy, durable cup that holds the ""right amount"" of ""classically"" served espresso. Simple, but attractively styled. This cup has a drawback - its narrow base - making the cup prone to tipping over when not handled carefully."
1,Not suited for peaceful meditation,"This CD was not what I expected. The bird sounds began innocently enough, but became very disrupting as it went on. I didn't feel it was conducive to peaceful meditation. After listening to the entire CD, I was unsettled by the noise of it. There was background music, but it was overcome by the bird noise, not just chirping but squawking, etc. It was abrupt at times. Don't think I'll listen to this again anytime soon."
4,We Go In a Circle,Good picture book to use to teach getting along with other children that are not like us. Shows another animal that is used for children's therapy.
4,Very solid air supply effort,"I heard this CD accidently, at while not a big air supply fan, I noted there are several beautiful melodies and well-crafted songs. The sentimentality is there as always, although a few songs enter a more sexual range which didn't appeal to me. Skip Body Glove, never listen to it. I burned my own copy eliminating 4 songs. That CD is golden.Very close to a big comeback album."
4,This one's not the best ever...,"I just got my copy of the albumn ""Yours Truly"" and i have to say that as of this very moment, im still not a very satisfied listener. i've been a huge air supply fan for a lot of years now and i know i've heard better. truth is, i thought the era of great music they provided the whole world started to fade away quickly after ""Vanishing Race"". still, though, i gave them a 4-star rating simply coz of bias, and i thought they gave it a good go...last hurrah probably? i hope a boxed-set would be next..."
3,air supply experiments,"NO ONE HAD THIS CD IN THE USA ON ITS RELEASE DATE OF 6-26. TOKYO DID NOT HAVE IT EITHER?? FINALLY I GOT ONE VIA INTERNET. I HAVE LISTENED TO IT 5 TIMES AND HAVE THE FOLLOWING REVIEW:TO QUOTE JIM YESTER OF THE ASSOCIATION BACK IN 1979 ""WE RECORDED SONGS WE THOUGHT THEY WANTED TO HEAR,INSTEAD OF SONGS WE WANTED THEM TO HEAR"" THIS SUMS UP THE TRAP AIR SUPPLY IS FALLING INTO WITH THEIR NEW CD. ALTHOUGH SONGS LIKE WHO AM I,WHY DONT YOU COME OVER,TELL ME OF SPRING,YOU ARE THE REASON,LEARNING TOMAKE LOVE TO YOU,AND HARD TO FORGET HER FOLLOW AIR SUPPLY'S LINEAGE I CANT HELP BUT FEELTHEY ARE GRASPING AT STRAWS TO create A SOUND THEY FEEL PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR. GRAHAM AND RUSSELLIF YOU READ THIS LISTEN TO YOUR PAST MASTERPIECES and please refocus.j.p."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CD!,Man was I disapointed when I listened to this drivel! I want my money back! I am so disapointed with Russel's vocal on this waste of plastic I am beside myself! How on earth someone could actually sell this cd to the public is beyond me! I am a very big Air Supply fan but man this will be the last new material cd I buy from them ever!A VERY LET DOWN FAN
5,shannon's man,"I really liked this book because of the setting. It took me away from everyday city life. Shannon really taught Matt that women should be treated with respect. I love reading books by Ms. Ray b/c of the way that she portrays her characters positively. I look forward to the upcoming issues.So I urge everyone to who hasn't read this book or any of her other books, to read them. They are all fast-paced and enjoyable."
1,Crock pot smart pot 5 quart,"I was very disapointed in this crock pot. The whole reason I got this crock pot was because it should automaticly switch to warm after it cooks your desired amount setting you put it on. Well with this crock pot the warm setting is PIPING HOT!!! I put some soup in there the other day that I had cooked on the stove then transfered it into the crockpot to keep warm. I left the soup in there on the warm setting for about ten minutes, went to check on it and the soup was bubbleing and so hot. And that was the warm setting!!! : ( I put a roast in this crockpot last week, put in on 8 hrs low when i got home it was burnt!!! The warm is to HOT on this thing....very disapointing."
1,Scary,"We received this crockpot as a wedding present. I have come home to scorched chicken breasts, burnt roast, and too many other horrible messes to name. Do not buy it. The lid does not lay nicely, let's moisture out, and rattles. Everything cooks the same whether on high or low. It gets so hot."
3,Cooks very fast on what should be low setting,"I replaced an old 2-setting Rival pot with the round Rival Smart pot Model 38501-W. Using a recipe for the old pot (Potato-Leek soup) I used the 10 hour setting figuring if I started at Noon it would finish cooking around 9 pm. Wrong! It was done in about THREE hours! The soup was delicious and more flavorful than I recall having made in my old pot, but I DO NOT recommend leaving the house for 8 or more hours with this pot cooking. Plus, condensation from the metal-rimmed lid accumulated, sputtered, and spilled over. I had to keep wiping it away. I won't return the pot because I had shopped around a lot before I bought this one."
3,"Nice Pot , but Handles Broke","I am looking on Amazon for a new Crock Pot because this one has broken. The plastic on the handles(face) began to become brittle and crack up. Pieces fell off over time. Then the handle itself broke. The screw holding it on snapped, now there is a piece of screw rattling around inside of the wall. I loved it otherwise, and liked taking it places. But not now. I did think that it got very hot and seemed to cook quickly (which was helpful to forgetful me) but after reading the above review, I wonder if it cooked at the same temp? Whatever, I'm looking again. And wondering."
3,An ok crockpot,"This crockpot works well but not great. It is difficult to make certain recipes because they require a short cooking time at a low temperature. This crockpot does not allow you to cook at the shorter times at a low temp. It only has 4 and 6 hours at a high temperature setting. So the first time I made a recipe it burned very badly. I now know that if a recipe requires a 4-6 hour cooking time at low, I put it at the 8 hour ( which is at low) and just put it on warm early. Since I figured this method out everything that I have cooked turned out great."
1,poor product,"I bought two cookers, one for each of my grown daughters, both Cookers burn the food each time they were used. Don't waist your money on this product."
1,BURNS EVERYTHING,"Definetly not a SMART POT do not buy this. I just threw one in the dumpster b/c it burns everything. I left it yesterday on the 10 hour setting and within 6 it had burnt the sauce and chicken, so needless to say the whole thing (dinner included) went in the garbage!"
1,terrible prodect,The low heat setting burns everything but soup. Will have to throw this one out and buy something different so I can have something I can actually rely on for dinner after work.
1,"Yes, it burns way too hot.","Agreed with all of the reviews. It burns way too hot, even on the lowest setting. One needs to be home to use it, hence defeating the purpose of a crock pot. Don't buy it - even on the 10-hour setting, which should be the lowest, it boils quickly."
1,Burns more meals than it cooks,I've finally thown in the towel on this product. It has ruined too many meals due to the fact that it runs too hot
1,You will be disappointed!,"In 30+ years I have had three slow cookers, including this one. I recently gave the other two older ones away because I didn't need three slow cookers. This one was a wedding present. This one is the worst. It burns everything. I want my old ones back!"
2,Hot spots,"I've had this crock pot for several years now. The handle on the lid has broken off, but the crockpot itself still works like it did when it was brand new. The only problem with that is the that it cooks too hot. It seems to get hot spots sometimes, and almost always burns the top edges of my food. I have to stir it all the time even on low. Honestly, I have no idea why I haven't replaced this thing by now. That's actually why I am on Amazon now. Good Riddance Rival."
1,Too HOT,"I've had this crockpot for 7 years, and it makes me crazy-everything I put in it is done after 3 hours on low. Makes it impossible to cook all day....don't buy this one."
3,Good for Audio Not Video,I got this unit 6 years ago and it is never able to handle video correctly. The upscaling is a joke. The video output quality is worse than the input. So now I use it as a pure audio amplifier. I have no complaint about its audio-handling except that the setting for a third-party woofer is kind of tricky. The unit will be burning hot for continuous running even at very low volume level.
4,An engaging story!!!,I really enjoyed this book. It caught my attention early and kept me turning pages to see what would happen next. I thought the story was very creative and fun.
2,Disappointed.,"I have an English Bulldog and English Bulldog Breeders seem to give Fromm Good reviews. Since changing my Bulldogs' food from Blue Buffalo to Fromm my bulldog sheds more than he normally does. Also, his gas is worse and more frequent. He has gained more weight. In the morning his eyes have that morning gunk in it and his stools are more runny than before. This is the only thing that has changed in his diet. I take really good care of my dog. By the way, I did not change him suddenly from Blue Buffalo to Fromm. It was gradual and I only feed him a cup and a half in the morning and at night. I will try the Senior Low Activity Version and if I do not have any luck I will switch back to Blue Buffalo."
3,Not so tasty,It' not very tasty...Not the best chewable on the market...Suppose the vitamin E content is fine but it does not suit my taste buds
5,Elements 3-piece Brown Metal Bistro Set,"just beautiful . . . I purchased this for a Christmas gift and it was a big hit! I was charged shipping fees, however, when Amazon offered free shipping . . . hum!"
1,Bien Viejo,"This book is very outdated - a lot of the information is old, inaccurate or misleading. There are much better books out there.la informacion en esta libro es muy viejo - hay muchos errores y cosas que ha cambiado en lost ultimos 10 anos de investigaciones. Hay libros que son mucho mejor."
4,baby loves it!,"My baby has watched Baby Einstein for the past 4 months but I decided to try Baby Miracle since it had some Christian music and used stories from the Bible -- I thought it would be interesting to try. My baby just loved it! I am not sure if she liked the story-method they used or just the vivid imagery. I highly recommend this to parents. Even though I am not all that religious, I am happy that my child can watch a Christian-themed video and become more comfortable with her heritage."
1,Snore . . .,"Boring as he--. Common sense stuff. I threw my copy in the trash can. Better to BUY and APPLY a copy of one of the classics such as, ""A Road Less Traveled"", ""The Art of Loving"", ""The Relaxation Response"" etc . . . Basically it is just very low level self-help stuff that could apply to one that is 'burned out' or one that is not.Then to top it off, at the end of the book, is a shameless ad to contact her for some ridiculous amount of money if you want her to be your 'life coach'. Ugh. If you need this kind of stuff, stick with Dr. Phil or Oprah instead.I think the higher reviews much be from her family/friends are something.Good luck and check out ""The Road Less Traveled"" by M. Scott Peck first. . .Dean"
1,Riddled with typos,"I wanted to like this book, but the Kindle edition is absolutely riddled with typos and errors. Grammar mistakes, missing capitalization, formatting errors... I was seeing a mistake nearly every other page. After three chapters I just had to quit, it was entirely too distracting and I couldn't take the book seriously anymore. I just can't understand how something like this can be published. It's as if no one bothered editing it."
3,"Colorful, Large Pics, Textures Okay","The story is cute. Nice rhymes. Helps child learn day from night, sleep from wake. Textures on touch are only mediocre, though. I have seen/felt better, varied textures in other books when compared to this one."
5,My daughter LOVES this book,My 17 month old daughter loves this book. She loves the story and the animals because she is able to identify them all and she knows exactly where to open the flap and feel the animal. NO REGRETS!!
2,tiny version of book,Just got this book that I wanted to order for my friend's son since my girls love it so much. I am not thrilled that it is not the same as the book we have. It doesn't have any of the fold over pages and it's tiny!
4,If you like murder mysteries this book is for you,"This book is a really good book, I recommend this book to anybody who at least likes reading little bit, especially if you like to read about drama and murder. Reading is not one of my strong points but this book was very easy to understand. I really liked the book because it kept me in suspense, and I never knew what to expect. Like in the begining of the book, I could not figure out why Michael Starkwedder was trying to help out Laura Warwick(the killer)so much.Although the book was like trying to put a puzzle together the whole time, it was very interesting and I really liked it."
4,2nd in trilogy of plays,"This is the 2nd and middle book of the 3 Osborne adaptations of Agatha Christie plays into novel form. I think it's the middling of the three in quality as well. The 1st was ""Black Coffee"" and the 3rd was ""Spider's Web."" All 3 read more like plays than novels--so if you are expecting the normal Christie novel, you may very well be disappointed. However, if you have read the novels, this is a lovely addition to your list of Christie's and a rare opportunity to envision her plays. True, the plays could just as easily have been bound and published. But, Osborne has apparently done little, if anything, to detract from the plays themselves. So, IMHO, he has done a service both to Christie and to the mystery reading public by publishing these works. As for the content, this particular work is great fun! I loved the story, the twists and turns (and there are many of them), the cleverness, etc. It IS after all, a Christie! And quite a good one at that. Enjoy!"
4,If you like murder mysteries this book is for you,"This book is a really good book, I recommend this book to anybody who at least likes reading little bit, especially if you like to read about brama and murder.Reading is not one of my strong points but this book was very easy to understand. I really liked the book because it kept me in suspense, and I never knew what to expect. Like in the begining of the book, I could not figure out why Michael Starkwedder was trying to help out Laura Warwick(the killer)so much.Although the book was like trying to put a puzzle together the whole time it was very interesting and I really liked it."
1,Silly and badly done...,As a huge fan of Ms. Christie I am sorry to say this reads nothing like her books. Maybe its because it was meant to be a play and should have been left at that. A true waste of time!!
2,"Stiff, Predictable, and Poorly Adapted","As an avid reader of Agatha Christie's novels (Hers were the first mysteries I ever read. I skipped right over Nancy Drew), I was incredibly disappointed in the adaptation of The Unexpected Guest. It is stiff, predicable, and (I never thought I'd say this)BORING! I honestly can't recommend this book to anyone."
2,Broken Handle,Our Rival Smart Crock just had a handle break. Model number 38601 with date code 5003. Got it in August of 2004. We've used it 20 times at most. Called Rival because it was the handle that broke and was told it was not part of their recall and was out of warranty. I'm going to report this to www.cpsc.gov and see if there's been other handle breakage on this model and what we should do with this crock pot.Edit: This incident has been reported to cpsc.gov.
2,Crockpot that overcooks!,"I agree with most reviews....even on lowest setting the food tends to burn, it seems as if there isn't a ""low"" even though it says there is, I have never had this problem with any other crockpot but this model! You can't leave food on while you are at work or it will burn!"
2,No control and to hot,The first time I used this crock pot it over cooked. On low and set for 8 hours. The lid does not fit also there is no way to set the unit to warm. It has to run through the program period before it will set to warm. This unit is not user friendly.
3,A hot cooker!,"This cooker does get very hot on the outside when cooking. It also seems to cook everything in half the amount of time and it leaves crusty burnt food around the edges. I really can't tell the difference between the low and the high temps, don't know if there is one. I like that the handles stay real cool, and I wish you could put this thing on warm temp yourself. It will only do it if it's set on the timer and automatically goes there. If you really want it after reading this, I'll make you a really good deal on mine. I'll buy a differnt one."
1,"Nuclear hot even on ""Low"" setting","Last night I made pork chops that were supposed to cook on low for 8-9 hours. After 4 hours they were way overdone.You would expect a crockpot to simmer, this one full on boils. Even on the warm setting.I have had this problem conisitantly since I purchased the product 2 months ago. I am an experienced cook and thought I was just having problems adjusting to a new product. But after having done some internet research last night I see this is a very common problem with these crockpots.I called Rival today and the customer service agent refused to admit there was a problem or to do anything about it.On top of rediculously overheating, you have very limited options in the times you can pick. So if you wanted to set something on low for 4 hours then have it turn to warm, not possible. I'll be looking for one with a real timer.Rival may have invented the Crockpot but I'll be buying a different brand from now on."
2,Not for the working person,"Good when you are home and only need to cook something 3 or 4 hours, REGARDLESS of what your recipe says. I've wasted much $$ on meat and other ingredients that are burned to a crisp when I come home, even though it is supposed to switch to 'warm'. I'm investing $100 in the KitchenAid model."
2,"It's OK, but not the best I've used.","It does heat up quite a bit and cooks rather fast, but I've learned to adjust my cooking habits and deal with it.My biggest complaint is that the handle gets HOT!!! I realize that these things can happen, but none of the handles on ANY of my other cookware get hot like this does (unless, of course, it is actually IN the oven!). If they could fix that problem, it would get a much higher rating from me."
1,"At least my boyfriend likes his food ""charred""","Using this was the first time I've burnt food in my life. As with the other reviews, I have followed the recipe, using the low setting and have come home to a burnt piece of leather. Sauces seem to boil on all settings (including warm) and it got so hot on the outside it heated my silverware in a drawer underneath a 2 inch marble counter top. It even turns bones into mush. You certainly cannot leave it unattended (which is the whole point of these things right?) Apparently trying to return it to Rival is kinda tough so I have taken pictures of what it does to food and I'm planning on using a thermometer to test the temperature it actually gets to (what can I say, I'm a scientist, I like to experiment)!"
4,Good simple box,"Good item, solid and works well for small jobs. Needs to be clamped down to a work bench for best results."
2,If quality is similar...,"save your money. I bought a similar Jorgenson miter box saw at a local big-box retailer for $19.99. It broke the first time I used it. Both of the saw blade-holding stanchions snapped off. Nowhere on the box did it specify using it only for balsa wood, so I used it to make some straight cuts on SPF 2 x 4's. The blade took over 150 push-pulls to get through the wood. I need something I can store in my car for the occasional handy work job. Looking elsewhere."
3,Plans to make furniture of the 1800's.,"A useful guide to making furniture in the style of the 1800's. Not suitable for amateur craftmen as the plans are rather simple and there is a lot left to their imagination, such as what finish to use"
2,"Good for experts, Novices should avoid","This book has great elevation plans for authentic craftsman furniture. A good number of plans are included. However, if you are looking for a book to teach you the basics of furniture making in the craftsman style, this is not the book for you. There are no exploded views of the pieces and no real description of the process."
1,SOUNDS BOGUS,"Since when does Fox release anything in VCD format? this is quite oviously a bootleg of some sorts. Don't get trapped into buying this, instead but the actualy dvd volumes of the show."
2,Ultraviolet SUCKS!! - Movie is ok,"Do not be fooled by thinking that Ultraviolet is a real digital copy. All you get to do is stream a copy of the movie from their site. It only works on your browser, so what is the point. In addition you have to have Silverlight installed, which is a crappy product that microsoft is dropping soon. They say you can ""download"" it. But all it does is put a silverlight file in a hidden location where it will then play from your hard drive instead of stream.There is no ability to play it on Boxee Box or even Apple TV like you can with iTunes digital copies that many movies come with.I hope the studios wise up a realize this is not what customers want."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED - Does not have a REAL digital copy. Only Ultraviolet rip off,"This set has a great Blu Ray, dvd and a horrible Ultraviolet streaming copy. I want a real digital copy that I can download using an itunes code and not have to be connected to a wifi connection or use a 3rd party video app.Ultraviolet is a rip off. Avoid this and just get the regular Blu Ray copy."
1,Pass On It,"My hope was to enjoy campy light childish humor for an hour but Hollywood delivered adult themes & jokes masked in my little blue friends. I intended to purchase this for my friends kid but I don't think it's appropriate for children. I felt like I was watching a long advertisement for specific sets of beliefs about the environment, sorcery, communication, astronomy...I was a bit taken aback by the way some of the smurfs spoke to one another. It seemed to me as though what was once innocent and friendly is more reflective of society today and not what we'd like our children to emulate. I don't want my friends kid to watch this movie & think that any of this drivel is edifying."
1,Really bad movie!,"While I can't comment on the actual Blu-ray or DVD, I will say that this movie just stinks! I had really high hopes since I really enjoyed the original TV show. This movie takes out all the magic and charm of the original and is a poor copy. I suggest you stay away from this movie and watch the original instead. I was embarrassed to show this movie to my kids it was that bad!"
2,They Butched Up Vanity Smurf! :0,"You don't see Vanity Smurf much in this new movie. However, his voice isn't as stereotypical now. They even got rid of his pink flower and replaced it with a yellow one. I wonder if in the 1980s audiences wouldn't put two and two together the way they would now, especially online. Instead of Tim Gunn playing a human character, why didn't they have him voicing Vanity!? He would have nailed it! I don't have a problem with PC, but maybe the Old Vanity wouldn't be deemed politically correct nowadays. Vanity was around before the rainbow flag was a symbol, but the Old Vanity sure would have looooved to drape himself in one. What if they change Snagglepuss or Peppermint Patty next!?"
5,Adorable,I remember the smurfs from my youth...:::sigh:::...I don't have any kids in the house so watching this was purely a nostalgic event. The characters were all done very well! And you really can't go wrong with N.P.H!!!

3,china?,"i'm not some kinda expert on the subject but i think this stuff comes from china. im not too comfortable taking it if it is. but it sure is cheap, so thats why i bought it."
2,Great unless it's OLD,"This is a great vitamin. I have used it in the lesser 500 mg dose.I was glad to see the higher dosage, but really disappointed when I saw the attached coupon which expired in 2010. I ordered these 5/12. The vitamins expire 12/2012. Gosh, have these been sitting around for 2 years?! Now what about the potency? Sad. I'll stick to the 500mg tablets. I have to take more tablets, but they're fresher. I'm out of money and time because it wouldn't be cost effective to return them."
2,not what I had expected,"I found this book to drone on and on with unimportant details names, dates, etc. When reading about certain Disney law suits, the author would give a mini bio on every detail of every person who was in the courtroom! Not necessary, I wish he would have just stuck to the facts. There are other books out there with more disney information. Not enough facts about the parks, etc. And, it seemed to me that the objective was to turn the reader against the corporation, where infact I am still very pro-disney. Too bad if every other company in florida doesn't like the fact that disney has a ""monopoly on the tourist spending"" It just reaffirmed how brilliant the Disney Corporation really is."
2,Zzzzzzzzz......,"I'll admit, I'm only half way through the book. However, to this point, I barely understood what I've been reading. I applaud the author for his obvious intense research, but seriously, how many names can one person possibly remember? There is so much trivial and confusing jargon in here, it's making for a very long 200 page read."
4,GOOD SHOW,Live in Europe 1979 Frank on tenor Sax Ted Dunbar guitar and a rhythm section led by Mickey Tucker. Call it Swing or call it Hard Bop Frank and the group give us almost an hour of it.
4,Enjoyable Read,"Many years ago Caroline Duval was madly in love with Derek Roberts. Her world came to a crashing halt when she learns that Derek proposes to another college classmate. She is hurt by his betrayal and breaks off all communication so that she can move on with her life.Derek couldn't understand what was wrong with Caroline until he overhears some devastating news about her.Caroline is asked to help tutor kids in an Atlanta community center for the summer. She is shock when she learns that Derek is also a teacher there. Their first encounter is not a pleasant one. But they agree to be friendly with one another so they can do their jobs. But will they talk to get to the heart of their unresolved issues of the past?Marilyn writes another book that is an easy read and catches the readers attention from the beginning. There is action, mystery and passion. It was also good to be caught up with some of the characters from her previos books. Again I think this is a book that your truly enjoy."
1,Modernist Veiw Point,"While some may find this book good as a RCIA guide I thought it highly suspect and would not recommend it.By questioning the basics such as whether the vigin birth was a real happening or just a super spiritual impression, the Bibles authenticity etc., this book rides a fine line of heresy as defined in 2089 of The Catechism of the Catholic Church.This clever dancing around these basics of all Christian and Catholic faiths is highly disturbing as my wife found while making the inquiry process of RCIA thus causing her to abandon RCIA. As her past evangelical impression of the Catholic faith as being heretical was unfortunately confirmed.All leaders and any teacher of any RCIA group should carefully read this book first before using it as a guide. Likewise, any RCIA leader or teacher should question the priest before using this book."
1,Good luck finding XP drivers.,"Even though this card comes with a driver disc from Supermicro, Windows XP will not find a matching driver. Forcing any drivers to install does not work. The closest I could find to a reasonable XP driver for this is some source code to complile your own. Not usefull. So one star because I never have been able to use this card in any machine. Maybe I'd have had better results with Linux, but who knows?"
1,WAY too hot!,"I had heard great things about crockpots, and bought this one. There are now 4 of us and I work, so the convenience sounded great. In 2 weeks I have used it 3x. Once for a thick bean soup, once for a chicken dish with fruit, and once for a beef in gravy dish. All were AWFUL because the darned thing just gets TOO HOT! In an hour or two everything was at what I would call a medium boil. With the chicken I came home, turned it to ""warm"" when I saw it was cooking 'real quick, and then took the dogs out. When I got back 45 mins later, the chicken was BOILING on ""warm"". I added large chunks of apples and they were all cooked very soft in about 15mins. Where's the SLOW in this slow cooker?"
1,WAY TOO HOT,"Even low runs way too hot. The exterior is too hot to touch and even the cord at the base is very warm. If by accident the pot was to touch paper or cloth or even too close to the wall, I'm afraid of fire. I think this model is dangerous. No one should go to bed with it on or leave the house with it on. I am dumping it. Too bad because it is a nice size and nice looking."
4,There are better (and brighter!) versions,"We wish the ""planets"" included glowed brighter and longer, and that the ""200 adhesive stars"" weren't just a strip of variously-shaped stickers (some so tiny they had to be removed with tweezers!), but all-in-all you get what you pay for and it is at least teaching our son about the solar system. The planets are also expected to be hung from the ceiling using fishing line and what amount to thumbtacks, so I recommend having some good nails or hooks at your disposal or you will probably be frustrated by bent tacks and hammered fingers. I will add that there are much brighter and longer-lasting plastic glow-stars out there. We found some and have made our son's room much more impressive since this purchase. We just tell him the dimmer stars are the ones further away. :-) Put stars up in your kid's room! It's really cool. Just get a lot and get good ones."
4,"Not very interactive, but does what it claims","First, this item was $5.99 with free shipping. The low price is a factor in this review.I bought this for my 7 year old first grader. She put the planets together without my help and labeled them. Then I hung them up with some of her help. It's an amusing toy but not very interactive. I'm not sure how much my daughter looks at it now, a couple of weeks later. But the toy does everything it claims.One suggestion for manufacturer - add the sun. Isn't a ""3-D Solar System"" without the largest body in it kind of strange?"
1,Ripped Off,The product was very heavy and cumbersome for hanging from the thin thread supplied in the package. also two people were needed to put it together in an effort to avoid the thread tangling once the balls are attached.Definitely not worth the money!!!
4,Well-balanced guide to West African food,"Those of us who hanker after the authentic African taste we grew up with will be pleased with the recipes in the book. Although some of the recipes are labelled with slightly different names, and they may not be just as we knew them, the taste will take you back to good times of street food and full stomachs. The only better African cookbooks I know are ""Wild Boar on the Kitchen Floor"" (available in PDF on my website) and the ""Crocodile Cookbook"". I think they're both out of print, but if you own a copy of the Crocodile Cookbook, I'd gladly type it up to create a digital copy!"
1,less than one star... but since there's no zero,"This is one of the poorest books I've ever used for learning any subject. This is simply NOT GOING TO WORK if you learn by reading/studying, rather than in class.I already have a college degree, and I've read thousands of books, and studied from many. Rarely have I found a book this thick that has so little1) EXPLANATION OF CORE CONCEPTS,or2) THOROUGHLY WORKED EXAMPLES OF PROBLEMS.There is a lot of verbiage but that is all.DO NOT WASTE TIME WITH THIS BOOK. Without a GOOD teacher, this book is beyond totally useless. With a teacher one can use this book for homework problems, but nothing more.Since I am doing this as a pre-requisite for medical school, I am using the web and a number of other texts instead. I wish I could find a good thorough text though."
5,NYSFFan,"Just received the newest edition - was really pleased with the format of pre 1980 cards in separate section - my personal collection is only in this area - now I do not have to thumb through all the pages unless I am going to look for something after the 1980s. While the prices may not match some of the other publications they are in the ""ball park"" (then again what is a card really worth??? Only what one is willing to pay). The best is the listing of all the cards not just the ""stars"". I consider this the best reference for pre 1960's cards."
3,Beware - Student Edition,Please note that this is the STUDENT EDITION of the Interior Graphic Standards. It does not say this clearly on the product title/link. It is a very basic overview of interior construction topics. Please Amazon - fix this in the product title/link. It makes a difference.
4,I LOVE this vacuum,"Hi, I have an older model Hoover Savvy it's about 4 yrs. old and I got it as a gift... It works very well on wood as well as carpet. The attachements are very good as well. I DID since it was a gift purchase the extended 3 yr. warranty which has been a real lifesaver ! I think it cost an EXTRA $99 but, it covers just about everything except for the filter replacement. I generally take my vacuum in to the repair shop every 6 months for a through cleaning and repair. This has kept my vacuum running GREAT ! In the past I haven't had much success with vacuums generally AFTER the first year they end up in the trash... This is the first vacuum that has lasted through children, pet(s) and wall to wall carpet... ! With any vacuum I think if you treat it with a little care and maintance it will last you quite awhile..."
1,Works great....for a year only!,"My husband and I purchased this in July of 2006 because it had great reviews and it was even a Good Housekeeping best buy! We're having the exact same problems! The power doesn't even work on ""bare floor"" and the brush agitator has completely stopped working on the carpet setting. The power flickers on and off on the vacuum and it is extremely difficult to drag this ""best buy"" across our floor now. So much for us *ever* buying a Hoover again! Run away!"
2,BEWARE,The worst vacuum purchase I have ever made. The circuit board has gone out twice in the nine months I have owned it. I have to travel 46 miles to get it repaired even though I can buy the vacuum several places in town. Hoover offered to pay shipping ONE way- whoopee. The sad thing is that the vacuum works great when it works. As soon as it is fixed again I am trading it in for a different brand. I don't dare keep it past the warranty period because who knows how long it will last.
3,Reg Didn't Strike Back Hard Enough,"Reg Strikes Back, while pretty good, is not a great Elton John album. It's not a very consistent album. ""I Don't Want To Go On With You Like That"", the first single, was a great, catchy, up-tempo song. It was a perfect Elton John song. The melody was insanely catchy and the lyrics were pretty cool. ""A Word In Spanish"" was a nice, airy, and enjoyable ballad. It is, however, nothing great or memorable. ""Since God Invented Girls"", an obvious homage to Brian Wilson, is better and prettier. ""Goodbye Marlon Brando"" is a fun rocker, but not classic Elton rock. The lyrics were fun, but kind of stupid. ""Poor Cow"" has a catchy beat but it is an instantly forgettable song. ""Japanese Hands"", ""Mona Lisa's And Mad Hatters(Part 2)"", ""The Camera Never Lies"", and ""Heavy Traffic"" are the rest. A real mixed bag. It's not mediocre enough to get two stars, but three stars might be too much. Not bad. But not great. So much better stuff lay ahead of Elton and his fans."
4,Good songs (generally),"Good ""comeback"" album/cd. Homage to Honky Chateau's ML&MH & some other songs revisit his better period, although it would be a while before he did a good song end-to-end. This is seen by most as hist first true step back up."
4,Back up Battery,"I bought this battery to back up the original one that came with LX3.I don't know if it is the camera or the battery but if you are planning for the whole day shoot on your vacation, you need to have two batteries!! and they are not cheap either."
4,small cross but very pretty,Bought this to replace one much like it that my wife lost. She really likes it because it looks like an exact replacement. A very good buy.
2,"Small size, but also small on performance","i wasn't expecting too much when i ordered this camera, but after i got it and took some pictures with it i now can say my webcam takes better pictures than this thing. it's really cool and small and techy, but man the resolution just isn't there. don't waste your money on this. spend 40 or 50 more and get a benq dc1500 or something semi-real."
1,"Thin, but not too good!","This camera take good pictures only in sunlight! Otherwise, without light, with artificial light it is so poor, so blur! I've got a create pc-cam 300 with 640x480 resolution and it's better better than cardcam.So, with almost sixty dollars I recomend you buy another one! Try philips key, it has low resolution but you can store almost 1600 photos!!!Good look!!!"
5,Very Nice Knife Set,I had been looking for a reasonable priced nice cutlery set. Am very pleased with the set. Would recommend it to others.
1,disappointing,"I doggedly sat through both painful cd's of this album, optimistically waiting for a glimmer of actual music to emerge. I was disappointed. Imagine the under-drone of bagpipes (without the music) together with the sound of some tortured cicadas and someone scraping their fingernail over a blackboard, and you've got the gist of the album."
2,take me back to Costes,"Could have done without this purchase - there is so much Costes anyway, don't know why i took the chance."
4,So glad that I have this...again.,"I purchased the same book a few years back and made the mistake of bringing it into work so that we could review the recipes. Alas, it was scarpered. I hope that whoever took it NEVER gets to make any of the recipes or does something wrong that makes them sick!I finally broke down and bought it again. I have made two of the recipes and would make both of them again. Delicious! This book is NOT going to be shared.The seller was prompt, delivery was timely and the book was in the condition that was advertised. It has well met my expectations."
4,A good basic simple cook book.,"I think this book is a very simple down to earth text on Indian cuisine. Thanks to ""curries without worries"" I was able to produce my first well made chicken curry. ( being an Indian )"
4,Pretty good read,"I thought the book was a pretty good read but could have been better. The ending was ok and it did remind me of ""The Player's Club"" with Kat being Ronnie and Tender being Diamond. There were some missing parts and last but not least, it showed how not only desperate men go to strip clubs, pay women for sex, and how we really have sick people in this world and how strippers aren't only stripping and or at the clubs, but also prostituting. I liked how the author told some back ground information on these women.But overall, the book was pretty good, gives a good message, is worth buying, and adding to your collection of books. I would recommend this book to anyone who is into drama, drug books, and stripping/sex books. I just wished she could have gotten her mother's boyfriend back ""Pete"" for doing that to her and I also wished that she would have gotten Kat back herself."
3,Too much information,Please people stop giving away so much of the story in your reviews. I have not read the book yet. I was hoping I could get a few opinions before buying the book but everyone seems to be giving away so much of the plot.Thank You
4,It was aight,This book was okay but I thought it could have been better also. The way it ended was like....okay what else. It interesting though and I read it two days.
4,Not the Glamorous Life,"One thing this book teaches us is that it pays to stay in school.Bad Girlz, Shannon Holmes's novel about the stripping industry, follows the misadventures of Tender and Goldie, both of whom come under the ""guidance"" of the intimidating Kat because of horrible circumstances at home. Although they know that stripping is wrong and struggle with their demons, they find it hard to leave the ""game."" And their so-called ""big sister"" Kat won't let them leave, intimidating them both with her knowledge and their supposed debts.This novel was realistic in that a lot of women are in this same predicament: trying to find a way of the life of wrongdoing. The plot gravitated you, and page by page, you're wanting more.The only reason I didn't give Shannon Holmes 5 stars was because of his countless grammatical errors."
2,A Hustler's Wife,"This book was a disappointment. It was unrealistic. The story line was slow, I kept waiting for something to happen."
4,Reminded me of someone I know,"I liked this book because it was so like the life that my sister has lived. Getting put out of the house at an early age. Nowhere to go. Prositituting herself for a place to stay. I read this book ten years ago, and it touched me then. I read it again last night, and I still enjoyed it. Kat reminds me of Roxie from the movie 'The Player's Club'. As I read the book, everytime Kat was mentioned I pictured Roxie. Great book because there are plenty of young women going through this very thing"
3,It was ok but I think I saw the movie already...,"From the beginning til about 3/4ths through, I thought I was reading a sketchy book version of The Players Club then towards the end I just wanted it to be over. The book started very detailed and then got speedy towards the end which made the ending rushed and corny. In all fairness, B-More Careful was soooooooooo great that I'm willing to keep reading Shannon Holmes' books. Check it out - it is a page turner and worth a ""quick"" read.... for the record I was torn between 3 and 4 stars... so I give this one 3 1/2."
2,Not the best,"It was nothing that I expected. After reading ""B-More Careful"" I just knew this book was gonna be all that and then some.. But it wasn't I was let down by this book. Maybe it just wasn't for me.. But this isn't a book that i would pick up and read again. Tender was too damn gullible, and Kat needed her a** whooped a couple times."
4,"Hold Up, One Minute!","Alright now,I know we all are entitled to our own opinion, butdang! y'all dogged my man out,now I will be honest, it did remind me of players club, but it was even more compelling and real than that, if you read in the book Mr. Holmes wrote this on behalf of the stories he heard while incarcenated. Now...I wouldnt say the book was his best but it was mos def GOOD! Wake Up yall its reality this type of stuff exist!, I dont know if yall live in fairy land, butim from the hood,andI know how maniplutive, and deciving the game, and females could be. Mr. Homles you hit home with this and Kat Got what she deserved, what comes around goes around. Now I mos def recommend this book! go cop it, and Mr. Holmes keep doing ya thing,im a REAL fan of you and your production, all though the editing isnt great the stories sure are!"
2,Not satisified...,"The problem with this book, is that a man has written a story about a girl.. He can't tell her feelings, and that's exactly what I missed in this book. In the beginning it happens a lot of things to fast, he should have told more around those things. Like the rape and the mother leaving her. Besides that it was an OK book."
3,Kat was a scary messy ho,Kat was evil as they come but her game was so weak. how could Tender not see through Kat's bull. Gloria my heart went out to her and i hate that she died before the truth was revealed and besides that a lot of things were left unanswered. all in all this is not the worst urban lit i've read but the storyline could've been tied up a lil neater especially when it came to Kat.I think Tender should've really stuck it to Kat and how did she come to the conclusion that kat would do right by her when it came to the money? Q was a straight up punk and i mean that in every sense of the word. first he all screaming like a lil byotch when Kat tossed the salad then he was just acting unofficial. i think this book had great potential to have been better it started out with a bang and kind of fizzled then picked back up. i have part two ready to rock and roll. i'm just puzzled how part two will go since 2 of the main characters are dead.
2,Not An Ideal Production,"I bought this review on the basis of my admiration for Peter Mattei whose voice and looks are an asset to any opera. His singing here is indeed beautiful. But the production is so at odds with the spirit of Pushkin and Tchaikovsky that it is hard to stomach.Onegin is essence of the Russian soul and this production completely negates that. Musically strong, theatrically a disaster."
2,Poor Quality,"I had been using this watch for about 9 months and I needed to reset the Analog time, I went to pull out the little wheel, and it fell out easily, I put it back in and the water resistance was apparently compromised and the watch broke. Also the band can get creases in it from the spot you use, and it damages the band."
5,Amazing!,"I have several books on photography, but this is the one I read through time and time again. Peterson shows a regular snapshot, and how, with a little effort, you can creat an eyecatching image instead. This book is loaded with excellent, inspiring images, and I give it my best recommendations."
3,Body Back Buddy Jr - better for air travel but not recommended,"I am so addicted to my body back buddy, that I take it with me when I travel. However, at 24.5"" long, the full-size BBB will only fit the largest suitcase. I bought this Jr size because it is 2"" shorter (22.5"" long). It doesn't fit in my carry-on, but it fits in the next size up.As others have noted, the BBB-Jr may not fit larger people. Its large end fits around my body, but I'm short and thin. The small end barely fits over my shoulder blade; I don't know why they made that end so pointy. So unless you are in a similar situation to mine, where you need to pack a BBB for a plane, I would not recommend the BBB-Jr. It is not as well-designed as the full-size tool. It should be an inch shorter and rounder and wider at both ends.The BBB-mini is only good for shoulder work, but I've found that older women are more comfortable using it than the larger versions."
3,well made,"i'm sorry to say, i did not end up using these odd appliances. i gave the big one away, and occasionally use the small one. perhaps i'm just a slacker and did not use them as intended or diligently enough. i just did not feel any particular relief from my chronic and generalized back pain. perhaps in the hands of an expert they could be helpful."
5,Wonderful books!,My son loves these books! He especially likes Good Night Moon and Big Red Barn. The Runaway Bunny is such a cute story but still too long for him. This set would make a great set for anybody expecting a baby.
5,Works great for VW Jetta TDI,"I picked this one instead of the non-powered Hoppy like Amazon says is a perfect fit. Don't listen to Amazon's filter for Jetta owners, this is the one you want. It is a little bit more a pain to route the power line from the battery to the trunk, but it is not that hard either.As a bonus the powered Hoppy is a separated power circuit from your lights, so you don't have the light dimming problem and timing change on the blinkers. As a bonus, if anything does go wrong with the wiring harness you still have your car lights working.I also like the extension cord so you can mount the box safely in the trunk and pull off the cord so you don't have it hanging outside getting corroded or ripped off when you go for that large Costco run.Get it, you will be happy."
5,The real life adventures of Jay and Silent Bob,"Had never heard of this movie when a friend rented it. Small budget documentary with no narration, the real-life characters pretty much do all the talking and a script couldn't have done it better. I honestly didn't know whether to laugh or cry sometimes because the honest portrait of these lives are so incredibly sad but also hilarious. Mike Shank is the most memorable character I've seen on screen in a long time, you gotta love him and wish this simple man will get some good luck. The film maker, Mark, is more manipulative and so driven by his film that one has to wonder about his motives whenever he deals with anyone, especially his ailing (but very funny) uncle who reluctantly funds the movie. It's rare to glimpse so deeply into someone else's life and this documentary does an incredible and loving job at it. Highly recommended."
4,A great movie that shows you have to have more than a dream to succeed,I can't believe I passed on this movie for a decade. This movie was highly entertaining to me. I loved watching the clueless Mark bumble through life all the while chasing his dream of becoming a director. This guy has the drive I am just afraid he lacks the vision or the intellect to ever make a successful movie.
2,Turned it off after 20 minutes,"I really looked forward to seeing this, so a friend and I rented the tape a few nights ago. Somehow, it just didn't fly for us and we turned it off after twenty minutes and watched something else. Listening to Mark, the principal subject of the documentary, spell out his dull, crackpot ideas scene after scene became tedious and even a bit depressing. So many people truly like this film and I certainly don't want to give their opinion short-thrift. I may even try watching this again at some point in the future, but the humor simply didn't hook me the first time around."
4,Need help people,"I was just about to buy this DVD, based on the recommendations here, but I noticed that the DVD is in Full Screen format.What's up with that?Was the film shot in TV aspect ratio? I'm not going to buy a widescreen film in Full Screen format."
1,Who'd want to spend time with this guy?,"I heard good things about this movie...critics thought it was unique and clever, so I decided to rent it. We waited for the good part...20 minutes, 30 minutes, an hour...managed to get through the whole movie but it was a chore (of the four adults watching, one fell asleep and one left!). The people in it are not particularly interesting, the movie-about-making-a-movie conceit has been done before, and better. All I could think is: this is someone I wouldn't even want to have a beer with, let alone spend over an hour listening to him (and goodness, if you want to make a film entitled ""COVEN"" you should really learn to pronounce the word!) The only sympathetic person in the film is the poor old fellow who ends up financing the movie (Mark's uncle I think?). Someone obviously thinks this Mark Borchardt has...what? guts? spunk?artistic vision? but I can't see it."
3,Fingertip Moistener,"What is there to be said? These are LEE Sortkwik Fingertip Moisteners, 3/8 Ounces, Pink (10050).... I don't have any other brand to compare it to but it seems to me that they don't keep my fingers moist enough when sorting papers."
1,CBT prepraration book that does not have a cd to prepare you,You buy this book thinking that it will actualy going to prepare you but you are wrong. The online tools are no longer available and therefore you can not practice online. The cd that accompany the book does not carry any cbt exams and once again you have no way to prepare your self. What is the point of buying a cbt preparation book if you can`t prepare yourself with the computer programs that you will be taking the test? Don`t waist your time or your money with this book.
4,Listening part is the best I ever have,I finished this book few days ago. I feel this book's best part is listening~~ I really appriciate that part. Because of that audio cdrom. I took toefl one time. Difiiculty is very similar to Toefl.
4,Great Source Reading,"Of the numerous books regarding the recent online learning movement that I have read, this book provided me with the most useful, applicable insights. I enjoyed the author's perceptive knowledge sharing. The resources provided in the book are definitely worth the price of the book. This author illustrates both the advantages and disadvantages of the unique contributions that technology can make in this evolving and exciting realm of online learning."
1,Uh...it's ALL Myth.,"We couldn't believe a lot of the answers given on the cards, so we're pretty sure that whoever wrote the cards just made up crap and claimed it as ""fact"". Try it yourself: Take one of these truth or myth cards, find out whether the game lists it as true, then search the internet. (In fact, type in google ""Urban Myth Game Snopes"") Most likely, the cards are wrong. I would've preferred the cards to give an explanation for their reasoning on why this or that was fact or fiction, and what the game's sources were."
5,Happy with purchase,I was pleasantly surprised by the easy and price. The shipment came in very quickly and I was very happy with the product. I would recommend and would purchase merchandise from this particular merchant in the fututre!
3,GGW Endless Spring Break 14,"A pretty fair offering from Mantra.A lot of good tops shown and a smattering of lowers also.All done on the beach, in clubs/bars,on the street and in interviews. There is one G/G sequence that rates pretty high.Good man on the camera doing this one.One girls breasts have been pumped up but ignoring that she does a hot job otherwise.The other girl gets in a few good licks also.Also a girl doing a pretty good solo performance gets herself off in the shower. Knowing what I do about it now I would still buy it."
1,Bomb! Avoid it!,"It couldn't cool an 11x12 room (high ceilings) while a window a/c with half the rated BTUs does ok. Its fan is very, very loud (although not the compressor).GREAT customer support for a ROTTEN product. Avoid it!"
4,My kid LOVES it...,"My 2 1/2 year old is obsessed with this movie, so I have to recommend it, but the quality is just OK. We have both learned new terminology from the movie, expanding both our vocabularies : )"
2,Ok,"We bought this DVD for my year old. The airplane chapter is ok. It's very corny and low budget but entertaining to my son. The Hellicopter segment is AWFUL. It looks like it was filmed with a VHS camera in the 80s. It has an awful storyline that makes no sense complete with bad acting. It's actually painful to watch. If it were not for the mediocre airplane segment, I would have asked for a refund. It's really that bad. I wouldn't recommend this DVD."
5,Furtwaengler and Flagstad at La Scala,"This is a live recording of Wilhelm Furtwaengler conducting at La Scala in the early 1950s. The house band is not up to the standards of Bayreuth or Berlin but serves well enough.With one exception, the cast is serviceable -- and probably better than anything likely to be assembled today. The Siegfried, Max Lorenz, is adequate (no small praise) but not especially memorable. The exception, of course, is the great Kirsten Flagstad, who here sings wonderfully well.The sound of the 1950s live mono recording is is about what you might expect. If mere reproduction is the most important thing for you, go elsewhere. If a brilliant conductor and a unique artist in one of her signature roles interests you, give this a try.Furtwaengler and Flagstad = five stars."

2,would not buy again,"The water has to be hot for them to slowly change color (though the effect is instantaneous if you boil them). You would certainly not want the water any warmer so you do not scald your child. They do, unfortunately, gain mildew on the inside (in case you were wondering why I boiled them). Especially since kids put everything in their mouths, I am not happy he can squirt the water in his mouth from inside the duck. I recommend either planning to replace these often, changing them out completely to let them dry, or just move on to a different bath toy. There are other ducks in the pond, so to speak."
2,Not realistic,"I was expecting more from Ed with this series. I came away disappointed. The series is basically about doing anything you can to be environmentally friendly. However, this is done at all costs. The average American cannot go out and buy solar panels for their sub 2000 sf home. Ed takes you on a journey each episode and basically buys items on a whim that are environmentally friendly. $20-$30k solar panels, $95.00 rain barrel, solar ovens(that noone realistically has time to wait on to cook), $45k Phoenix Motorcars Pickup. You this show only as a guide. Plant more trees and replace your worn out vehicle with a Jetta TDI and burn biodiesel. Buy energy star appliances when you replace your old ones. Get a rain barrel when you can afford one. You can't have both solar panels and trees."
1,Worse than a bootleg copy,I am a professional dance videographer. It is obvious that this was not taken from any source material. It is not even a good copy of the original VHS tape. It has dropouts all over it in a very non VHS fashion. It looks more like a third generation copy that was made from a Hi8 copy. The extra pictures are awful. They are the poorest still shots taken from the video. They were not full frame and no attempt was made to enhance them. This is an amateur copy made with low end equipment and without skill. There was nothing new so it should not even be advertised as such. This is DVD should never have been released. It is nothing like the original which is excellent. I was personally familiar with some of the Moiseyev dancers and it is a disservice to display an otherwise fabulous performance in such a manner. Buy the original VHS tape version.
5,Durango trailer lighting,"great dealthe kit fits perfectly, was easy to install, and works great.i was able to loop the ""tail"" up into the rear storage bin cleanly"
4,Pretty good snack,"I tried this because of a guilty conscience from eating too much candy and greasy, salty snacks. They are more flavorful than most dried fruit I've tried. Cherries taste more like prunes than fresh cherries but they are not bad. Apples are very good and peaches pretty good. Best in the pack are the nuts. I am subscribing for regular deliveries of these packs."
1,Nothing new about that.......,"This is a book where you have seen everything before. I was very disappointed. Margaret J. Miller normally makes good books to my knowledge. But this is just a repetition of what we all have seen before, put at a different angel. It look's to me that is just about producing a new book, whit old ideas."
4,Exclusively Written,"Dear You,You've taken fantasies and dreamz to an entirely different tier. XXX-Con it's apparent that you're using your time wisely, providing visitors with a pleasurable 69 mental voyage, one after the other.6 Dreamz & 9 Fantasies: The Mental Erotic Voyages of a Convict is overflowing with dripping wet feisty tales spanning for the grown & sexy.

5,Inhale Deeply....,Roger's images call to you in silence....if you close your eyes you can catch the scent of the wood and the essence of the ocean....inhale....deeply.
5,Warrant Rocks!,This cd is great! I love the cover songs and the originals are classic! `Subhuman' is a great tune live at Glam Slam and on disc! I can't wait to see what Jani and the band do next!
2,Questionable accuracy,"While reading this book I noticed several inaccuracies pertaining to Charles Lindbergh. For example, Wallace attempts to help build the kidnapping case against Richard Hauptman by stating that the kidnap ladder was found in his garage. In reality, the ladder was left outside the Lindbergh home. This is a minor detail and does not pertain to the central theme of the book, but if the author can't get such a simple fact straight I have a very difficult time with the accusations that Lindbergh and Ford were both Nazis. The book is almost entirely speculation based on little to no real evidence. The author clearly set out with an agenda to discredit these two men and was willing to grotesquely contort any facts necessary to accomplish this goal."
5,Awesome product,I purchased this item because I needed to ground my amp. They are pretty rigid and good quality. The only thing is that the terminal is pretty thick. I recommended it all the way. A good thing about these terminals are that you can just screw the cable in (the allen wrench is not included though) and you are ready to go. Excellent overall.
2,Strangely similar to watching several seasons of Lost,"You can read a synopsis of the plot in other reviews so I'll cut to the chase. I found the book intriguing but much like watching progressing seasons of Lost and thus disappointing overall. It seemed like the inclusions of supernatural and man made mystery were forced together or at least very unintentionally clumsy. Again, I felt like that was where Lost went. It went so far that I looked up the publishing date and found it was published around the time of the show's debut. And that was before the show started showing signs of the scientific testing aspect. I still have to wonder if one of the writers hadn't read it and been influenced.I appreciated the casual Christian references but was disappointed in their substance."
3,the girl who loved wild horses,I thought there would be more text for a 7 yr old who loves horses and reading. Have not given it yet.
2,Love the book cover...,"...and I suppose that's what I get for judging it by its cover. I expected the book to be funny bordering on side-splitting since Peck has been compared to Erma Bombeck. But where Bombeck was hilariously wise and self-deprecating without groveling, it's hard to believe Peck is in her 50s. While reading I kept picturing a kid with a copy of ""Increase Your Vocabulary Overnight!"" trying too hard to be funny -- her writing is often irritatingly choppy and even worse, contrived.Apparently the book was originally written just for the amusement of family and friends, and perhaps I am being unfair by virtue of my own high expectations. But more often than not, Peck's stories fall flat into that stale silence immediately following what *you* thought was funny, yet wind up red-faced and mumbling, ""Well, guess you had to be there..."""
5,Gorgeous book,"Having just visited Georgia O'Keeffe country, this book was fascinating to read. The author shows actual photos of the sites where O'Keeffe painted. Additionally, we read of times when O'Keeffe altered her vantage point within the painting to make the piece more visually interesting. A very interesting and beautiful book for those who are O'Keeffe fans."
1,Prepare to wash your eyes.,"This book changed my life. For the worst. I used to be a functioning member of society. These sayings have lead me so far astray that my own mother refuses to speak to me. Or perhaps it's the creepy cover of this book. Those eyes, they haunt me. I used to be happy."
2,Disappointed,"I was so excited to get this coloring book for my son who loves cowboys. However, when I got it and flipped through the pages nearly every single cowboy is smoking a cigarette or a pipe. We're a non-smoking family and my kids are pretty young (my son is almost 4) but he loves everything about cowboys. I just didn't want him to get a glorified notion about smoking. He wants to dress and do everything like a cowboy and I don't want him to get it in his head that if he's a cowboy, he has to have a lasso in one hand and a cigarette in the other. I would have be okay with it even if it was two or three pictures, but it's nearly every single page (except one, I think). I'm going to toss it and just buy him another rodeo coloring book, since he loves that one so much."
1,Not pleased....,"Not pleased with this product....I thought it was actual tape, but it isn't. Carpet slid all over the floor. Ok to use for low-traffic areas...."
4,Perfect image quality,"This is a perfect camara with perfect image quality and rockbottom price around three hundred dollars with deals. How ever the batteries that came with the camara drained off in 2 min. Also, I dont like the sound it makes while the camara zooms in and out, sounds as if the motor inside is grinding some thing. I would also have liked a webcam functionality, which it lacks. Also, the digital zoom is pathetic, don't expect to use it. The screen goes blank for a second and the zoomed picture comes up. Continuous digital zoom whould have been nice.Now that functionality that I like, microphone with movie capture, connect to tv and play pics and movies, picture quality which is the most important thing, easy interface and manual settings for picture capture."
1,Wish I could give negative stars,"I have owned a few digital cameras before and hands down, this is the worst of all. The zoom was messed up after a couple of months of purchasing and the red-eye reduction never worked. Adding to that, the customer service was horrible. It took the service people almost 2 months to tell me that I need to pay to get the camera fixed, even though the camera was still under warranty and it was the camera's fault. I was not provided with any explanation as to why I need to pay to get it repaired and never heard back from them. I may have used this camera for 3 months and never got good pictures out of it. It used to shut down by itself. At first I thought it was the batteries but that was not the case. Stay away from this camera."
2,OK,The book is in such poor condition that I am concerned it will fall apart as I attempt to read it.
3,Low Visibility,"This is better than my kids carrying around mayo jars...safer too. But, after they put their creature in, you couldn't see it very well. The mesh was too dense. You couldn't see the details on certain bugs. They liked the mayo jars better."
2,Print head requires too frequent cleaning,"I use the labelwriter for file folders and mailing labels, maybe 5 or 6 a day. I am lucky to get through two days without having to expend another cleaning pad to get readable lables. Tech support has been lacking. I'd buy another but not without an unconditional, over the counter, exchange guarantee. When they work, they are great. I'd prefer ink jet print cartridges over the problems with the thermal print heads."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"The Dymo LabelWriter 330 was a HUGE disappointment. After loading the software 8 times, it still does not work with Microsoft Word 2000 as advertised. This is simply more trouble than it is worth. It doesn't work with QuickBooks 2001 either. What I thought would be a real convenient time saver is more like an unproductive desk accessory. SAVE YOUR MONEY."
5,Just Great!!!,"I own all three of these coffee table books by this arthor. They are simply stunning, colorful, beautiful photography, I can spend hours going through them, each time is like looking through them for the first time. The first two are covered in beautiful African fabric, the third, ""African Interiors ""(25th Anniversary Special Edition) has a paper jacket , I purchased it here at Amazon, Nov.2008."
5,how,both books are wonderful!!!!!! it's a mix between travel & interiors. another taschen-you-must-have-it !!!!!
4,"CUTE, but FRAGILE!","We had two of this item originally, and I was thrilled to find it here when we broke one of them. Cute, cute, but be careful - this bowl will chip very easily!"
2,Quality-both physical and content are below average,"Firstly, the quality of the physical book wasn't 100%. The back cover was bent and looked old. The book wasn't written very well. Besides the grammatical errors the content wasn't as entertaining as I would've liked. Overall this was a bad purchase."
2,Could have been better,"Because this is a collection of essays, a certain amount of repitition in the writing was to be expected. But it still made reading this collection a bit tiresome.In many cases, the same critisisms have been done better, or at least more up to date. And there was a whole section I skipped over entirely just because all the essays were the same.This book has some important stuff to say about what is going on in the right-wing media, but it could have been presented in a much better, more interesting way."
1,Same rhetoric yet again,This book uses the same low and tactless charges to bash conservatives that been used by liberals for years. The opinions within this book represent the opinions of about 10 percent of the american people. Such viewpoints are based on hate of opposing opinions and an unrealistic and fase ideology.
1,total lack of substance,"A tired but still commonly used trick-if u cant win the debate slander the opponent. Ann Coulter, O'Reilly, Hannity etc point out the Left's repeated failings (the UN, the Liberal ideology, big government, socialistic programs, handouts, and appeasing tyrants) and point out better alternatives. So the response to this? well hate of course! Whats a liberals defenition of a racist? a conservative thats winning an argument. so if u want to support slander, small minded irrational anger, and the one world view is all anybody should hear vision of the liberal left then buy this book and shut off the higher reasoning functions of your brain."
1,Very Disappointed!,"If we liberals want to get our point across in an intelligent manner, then we must write factually and leave our emotions out of the arena. This book was a disappointment. Don't waste money or time. Couldn't even finish..."
1,I hate Clint Willis,"I never heard of this guy but I hate him because in order to sell his book he negatively uses the names of people I admire just to sell his book to people who hate people like me (Conservatives). Now I will return to what I started to do before I noticed the title of this book and that is to buy the new Ann Coulter book entitled ""Guilty""."
1,Petty and juvenile,"Not much to say here--except save your money. This book will end up at a garage sale or a thrift store's 25 cent bin. Very poorly written and works to do the opposite--make neocons look much smarter, wittier, and certainly more accomplished because one can't help contrast the childishness of this book with the accomplishments of those it attempts to vilify."
1,One Hideous Book,As I read this Book I realized that I had begun to hate this Book rather than the Conservatives that it was aimed at. Old stuff + nothing new here made this Book progressively boring. Really a struggle to finish this one. This Book seemed to try to take on too much & wound up never really accomplishing anything.
1,complete waste of time,I bought this title at a used book store for $2 and feel cheated. Poory written and more opinion than fact. I threw it in the county recycle container so at least it stands a fair chance of getting ground up and recycled as an intelligent book.
5,What a wonderful moving tribute...,"This is one of the most beautiful CD's I own...I tell you, it's PERFECT! But there are points in the music that I cant help but wonder how much more perfect this CD would of been w/ James Lynn Strait singing the songs himslef...The best song on the CD is definetly ""Divided"" by Brandon Boyd of Incubus, another great band, my favorite actually. Anywho, just a wonderful CD, w/ brillant lyrics that make you think about living loving and losing... every time you listen to it."
5,"vermeer, a door to another world","vermeer's paintings are a door to another world. you see just a small panel with some touches of brush. how familiar this world is, you see the same windows, maids, tables, wine glasses etc. as countless other painters have drawn. but how astonishing this world is, inside these small paintings a wholely new world is. this book will show you the whole world vermeer's paintings create inside small space of canvas, with kindly, easy explanations and full enough illustrations. you may find other catalogues of vermeer's paintings. but if you have this book, ohters are only burden on your bookshelves."
2,not worth buying,"This is not a course to take if you are new to qi gong. He doesn't even mention posture, alignment or breathing. Then at the end of the DVD, it is mentioned that I can buy another DVD for more...more of what? He has better books that I thought were great. However, I wouldn't recommend this DVD to anyone unless they wanted JUST a demo. Try Terrence Dunn or Jiang Jian-ye and many others to learn something. this DVD is advertized as a demonstrational-instructional video so they should call it just a demo or sell it for half price. thanks. Brooksy"
1,Terrible film,"This film was terrible, the plot could have been OK, but the acting was awful. Slowest flying Dragons in History. Overall just a waste of time to make and to watch. Don't bother watching and definitely don't waste your money buying this."
4,"Wow,PROCHNOW,Just Wow...Great Job to all of cast/crew.","MERLIN and the War Of The DragonsTheasylum.ccDirected By Mark Atkins, Starring Jurgen ProchnowDragons are beloved by the film watchers , They have a mystique that takes us away from Wall Street and Bail Outs.The dragons are depicted awesomely , CGI never looked so good in a film, Congrats to Tiny Juggernaut-again.The acting brings you in to this time of past, No actor let us down with unreal emoting.Jurgen Prochnow , Of DUNE fame; Could have phoned in his performance, BUT Prochnow does a great job as Mage and Mentor to Merlin.Great cover art, Great acting and let's face it you picked because of the dragons and the unusual way they exist is plausible.Whenever a film from The Merlin/King Arthur school is released we wonder if people go back to the source, Read a book or seek out earlier Knights Of The Round Table movie/tv fare."
4,blast from the past,"This item is just what I'd been looking for. One of my fondest childhood memories is of using a square wooden twist board at my friend's house every time I visited. I have been looking for one for years and even tried to have one made. I decided one day to do a search for one just to see what would happen and there it was, different, but the same. I love it! It is simple to use and fun. My kids love it too. I have to hide it from them just to get time to use it. It could be a little bigger for better balance, but it still works wonderfully. Best of all is the price!"
4,Twist Board exactly as designed,"I wanted a simple, portable way to enjoy moving my body more. This is it. I just hop on it during commercials or when I need to get up and move from my desk. It works."
4,C'mon Baby! Let's Do The Twist!!,"I got one of these because it was so much like the board I had in the early '80's. It does give you a workout and you do get results.Slightly bending your knees and squating a little (changing from up to down) works the waist, thighs and gives you a decent workout for a little bit of time provided you work out on it without using momentum.I think it could stand to be a little bigger or maybe even square for better footing.Holding a towel behind you with both hands and 'wiping' your back/butt you can learn to do ""the twist""If you tire of it, the little ones can play on it, use it for a lazy susan...there's lots of things to do with this board!"
1,Settles at the bottom,No matter how much you stir. After 2 minutes it settles down at the bottom and when drink this and reaching 3/4 then it tastes like SAND...
2,MOUSE WILL NOT WORK ON DARK SURFACES,"I purchased this mouse so I could do away with both the wires from the mouse that constantly become tangled and the annoyance of using a mouse pad. After I set up the mouse, which was quite simple, I found the mouse did not work. I called several friends of mine who had purchased this mouse to see if they could help me in discovering why it was not working. I learned that you must use this mouse on a desk top that has a light colored surface. My desk top has a black surface and would therefore not work. I now have to use a light colored mousepad or a white sheet of paper under the mouse for it to work."
2,"Nice, but not quite","Wireless is very good, but for both (we ordered 2) neither one had a working side button. Too bad too, I had looked forward to being able to use the ""back"" function."
5,It's about time,"For a few months, I bemoaned the fact that nobody was taking the obvious step of giving users both cordless flexibility and optical precision.Logitech was the first to pull it all together, and they've done a really good job. The mouse is comfortable in the hand, with nice curves and reassuring heft. It feels solid in every aspect: The firm, springy response of the buttons matches nicely with the unusually--and pleasantly--resistant feel of the scrolling wheel.I can't think of anything I'd change to improve on this mouse. The weight, the solidity, and the free movement all combine to make a mouse that just feels right."
1,Logitech customer service poisoned me for life.,"I really, really wanted my logitech mouse to work. They failed to produce Mac OS X drivers for months, and their support staff was aggressively rude.On the other hand, the day Kensington announced Mac OS X drivers, I canned my Logitech and never looked back. Their support is awesome, always has been, I made a comment on the registration page and got two emails from the product manager and a VP asking for more details about a suggestion I made. Which they implemented...Never, ever buy any Logitech product if a Kensington one is available."
4,"I Agree With ""Winterstone"", Except...","...it can be used with both the left and right hands.I am somewhat ambidextrous and have no trouble using this mousewith either one (actually, I'm a righty but for some reason I prefer using a mouse with my left hand).I can now move the mouse to my right (where there is another desk) and scroll & click while I'm checking a document or notesand then move back again to my left.I can't believe how wonderful an un-tethered mouse can feel!"
5,Best.,"Some say that this mouse isn't one for gaming, but I beg to differ. I am an avid gamer, and bought this mouse for my laptop (hehe, Dell Inspiron 8000...)and all I can say is it's the best, and it dosnt look half bad either.For games it takes a few minutes toget used to, but I find it real easy once you get used to moving it. (I think the slight oddness was from the added weight and the friction change.) If this bothers users, they can simply set the mouse sensitivity up or down.Not only that but it has a five year warentee (like you'd need it)I would recommend to anyone, ANYONE, to buy this mouse. You won't regret it."
1,Total hype and baloney,"If you want an excellent book on understanding your potential and truly have a desire to develop the REAL SKILLS a trader needs read...Trading In The Zone by Mark Douglas.It is amazing and really goes in depth, yet the book is simple and only about 210 pages.Just like the Japanese Candlestick guru Steve Nison...these guys present, explain and teach you only what you need to know. No fluff. No bunk.If you don't fully get it all the first time, just read it again. Like any educational book or learning process...it is best to lightly read the whole thing...get the whole picture...then go back and read it again and that time, go nice, slow and digest it fully.Good luck"
2,swiss miss vanilla hot chocolate,"I have been very pleased with everything I've received from Amazon up til now - I ordered the large quantity of swiss vanilla hot chocoalate, because it was pictured in the blue box...what I received was the brown box - which is definitely not as flavorable....disappointed!"
4,Worth Watching for the Actors Alone,"I liked this movie, even in spite of all it's structural flaws (And there were many). The reason? Quite simply it's the cast. the way they bounce off one another, the way the dialogue is delivered, the sheer chemistry between the teams of Ansari/Eisenburg and McBride/Swardson, is fantastic and very enjoyable. The plot may be forgettable, but that just makes the cast stand out even more by comparison."
2,not as funny as advertised,"i watched the whole movie, not real funny, hard to stay interested in it. would not reccommend buying this movie."
3,"Very Funny, Falls Short",The comedy in this film is top notch and you'll definitely be in for some laughs. The acting is superb and that's largely to do with the excellent casting. Swordson and ansari are an amazing set of comics in their own right. Danny mcBride basically plays Kenny Powers here but it doesn't matter as it fits in so well with the plot.The only thing that left me wanting more was the scope of the script. I felt like it could have been a little more in depth on the romance and the ending was one of those I wish it hadnt ended affairs.The ad libbing was pretty good but noticeable for sure. You won't think the actors lines are scripted. Overall worth a rent but not a buy. the extra features are the usual behind the scenes lovefest and outtakes. Nothing too impressive but again worth a one time watch.
2,Just not funny,"Besides a couple of original one liners this just isn't a funny movie.It's really too bad as the plot itself is actually decent for a comedy but after that it falls flat.Is it worth watching? If you have nothing else to do it is, but don't expect to roll out of your recliner laughing at this one."
4,"A Bit Vulgar, But A Lot Of Fun!","There was quite a bit of vulgarity in this movie in some parts, but I started watching the movie expecting there would be, especially since Danny McBride is in it. That fact aside though, if you can get past that, this movie is actually pretty funny and a lot of fun to watch. Basically what it boils down to is this...if you like to laugh and don't mind a bit of vulgarity, check this one out! 'Nough said!"
1,STUPIDITY not even at its best.,"This movie was so tiring to watch...I didn't even bother finishing it. But I had enough will in me to warn you all to not waste your time. (By the way, one star is just too many.)"
2,Fails to be properly dark OR funny,"This seems like two different movies crammed into one. First you have the semi-serious dark comedy starring Eisenberg and Danny McBride, who both give fairly nuanced performances. If the route these two actors had taken had been followed by the writer and other cast members, this MIGHT have been a decent movie. Instead, we get the predictable goofy roommate, played by Ansari, who is a Chris Rock level of horrible actor, some extremely infantile violence-laced humor, and the most idioticly unrealistic ending I've seen in ages. This movie is not just stupid, but assumes that the audience is stupid as well.This is based on a true story that is FAR more interesting than what we get. Of course, in real life, the pizza delivery guy died a horrible death, so a comedy might be a hard sell. What a horrible tribute to a real-life tragedy."
2,Oily,"Wished the description had specified how oily or greasy this product was. Thus, I discovered on my own. This product is very greasy almost the consistency of lard :o(. Wanted to give this product a try, so I used it for almost a month and no real advantage for my hair. Could only use it at night and a small amount because the oil would appear on my pillowcase. NOTE: Better used on wet hair because of the concentration of oil. Scent was not refreshing, honey fragrance is missing"
4,Down to earth,"Tovani's approach to teaching reading to the most reluctant of learners is rather insightful. She does an excellent job of pointing out the assumptions that above-average readers make while reading that are not necessarily a part of the reluctant reader's experience. The only criticism I have of the book is that I had hoped to find ready to use material for the classroom. Instead, I found that while reading, it forced me to re-evaluate my own instructional approach. Ultimately, this is probably a far better thing than any quick fix approach. If you teach inner city kids or kids who come from homes where reading is not the norm, I believe you will find this book most helpful to your overall approach to managing the language arts classroom."
4,Missing Me and Virgil,"I agree with some of the other reviews. The box set is good but could have been so much better. There are some wonderful songs that were not included with this set. It is a shame. I kind of laugh to myself as I sing the Barenaked Ladies song ""Box Set"". It is almost fitting."
5,rock music at it's finest,genesis's archive #2 is the compilation featuring the hits with the great phil collins.it is a well established fact that genesis rocked with both peter gabriel and phil collins.very highly recommended.five stars.
3,"haven't purchased yet, but interesting reviews!!!","I would be interested in finding out where all these hard to find Genesis music is to be obtained if not by these new album releases!! I have most all of Genesis on album or cd. But you find me a copy of the American release of ""3 sides live"" and I'll show you a 3 headed chicken! I would agree also with a reviewer that if someone wants to please more of the Genesis masses of the 70's and 80', let's see some of the live concerts complete. King Biscuit used to play their Abacab concert and 3 sides live concert----now that was GOOD STUFF! I always wanted to OWN the version of Dance on a volcano-Los Endos off of one of those concerts! (They could have had that on this album also!) I believe I will be purchasing this box set because of the music I am missing fron the 3 sides Live album----less the ""Me and Virgil"" track.(Where did that go to?) I'd like to see some feedback on this!!"
4,What goes around comes around,"The main character isn't a detective but a survivor of Hiroshima, who with a small number of others went on to make a life for himself in L.A. He makes a living as a gardener, tending the lawns and shrubs of those living in the L.A suburbs. He doesn't believe in Jesus or Buddha, but Bacchi (`what goes around comes around').Set in the present day, he gets caught up in a story with roots back to Hiroshima and a childhood friend Joji Haneda.The story is a slow-burner. Good start, but many may have to persist to get through the middle section of the book because the pace doesn't accelerate. In fact, as another reviewer has commented, mixing Japanese words in disrupted the rhythm of my reading, as you 'stop' to work them out.However, if you persist, this is an enjoyable mystery- interesting context, well-drawn characters, well-constructed plot and a conclusion that invites reflection."
4,Frankie Chan's comeback film,"Legendary Amazons is a remake of the Shaw Brothers film 14 Amazons.It is produced by Jackie Chan and directed by Frankie Chan. Frankie has done it all from acting,directing,writing and composing music for many films in Hong Kong.Legendary Amazons stars Richie Ren,Cecilia Cheung,Yukari Oshima,Fung Hak On who also did the action choreography.This film focused less on the story and gave the original movie what it lacked,which was the action.About 70% of the movie is out in the field and Frankie Chan gives you your money's worth.The female soldiers have never looked so smooth handling swords, spears,wearing armor.No Donnie Yen,Jet Li,Wu Jing,Tony Jaa.That's okay they weren't needed in this one."
1,"It is a child movie, almost a cartoon.","Most of the characters are simplistic and almost laughable, on the verge of idiotic. I knew a movie by Jackie Chan would be easy on the brain, but this one insults your intelligence.I got this movie to see a strong Asian female leader, and this almost delivered, but it got too silly, and I don't mean ha-ha silly, cause I don't think they were trying for ha-ha silly.If you want a well made martial art movie that is clever but still fun, get/watch Kung Fu Hustle, that's a great movie. But, avoid this at all cost, unless your under 10 years old."
1,Useless magazine,I'm somewhat glad they've decided to take this magazine out of print and go digital only. The articles are poorly written and of a low quality. The topics covered are varied and mostly pointless.
2,Steady decline,"I've had this for a few weeks now. I used to read it before it changed ownership. Now it seems like the whole thing is one big ad for the Daily Beast. It seems to have gotten even more liberal. I thought the article on the downfall of the white male was some sloppy journalism. I saw another article online where one of their journalists got a little confrontational with Adam Carolla in an interview, and she hadn't read his book and wasn't trying to be even-handed about the interview at all. Newsweek also has an annoying new format with big pictures and big text that looks like it's written for a little kid.I think I'll go back to Time, although I'm not thrilled about them either."
1,Pages and pages about Vogue editor Anna Wintour?!,"So maybe she wants to be a diplomat, but is that really worth more than a paragraph? I'm very disappointed in what this magazine has become since the Daily Beast has become part of it. It seems more like a gossip rag than an in-depth news magazine. The articles are often unimportant and are written in a snarky, hip style, instead of the intelligent, informative style it was just a few years ago. The U.S. news is thin, and the international news is thinner. I miss their former science writer, Sharon Begley, who could explain anything in a fascinating and engaging way. So much of their stuff seems barely relevant these days. The decline of this once great magazine is really disheartening!"
2,Many formatting errors and missing items,"I have been subscribed for a couple of months now and it seems Newsweek is spending almost no time or effort in preparing this for Kindle. For example there are many instances of wrong hyphenations or spaces being inserted in the middle of a word. In June 27th issue, in the first article you see ""th ey"" rather than ""they"" and many other case like this.Also you don't see as many pictures or charts that you would find in the print edition and some of the sections/articles simply are not there. I'm considering canceling my subscription."
1,Ridiculously liberal,"My title says it all. If you are liberal, you may like it. If you are not, you will find the bias infuriating."
1,Has hit the skids,"We've subscribed to Newsweek for almost 15 years. I didn't much like the format change over a year ago, because it was hard to tell the stories apart from the ads. But we stuck with it because some of the stories were still worthwhile (when we could find them). However, since Tina Brown took over as editor in chief, Newsweek has been nothing but tawdry and sensationalist with a thin pretense of ""news"" that has been mostly reduced to photographs. Many of the previous regular journalists are no longer featured, and instead the magazine has mostly entertainment opinion pieces, not even entertainment news. We are canceling our Newsweek subscription and looking for another source for news. Thank you to other reviewers for your suggestions for alternatives!"
2,No longer a good read,I am no longer able to read this magazine. I don't see unbiased journalism and fair coverage of both side of stories. Some articles are still great but others are just taking a point and running with it right wrong or indifferent
1,Not nearly as good as it used to be...,"I finally have to cancel my subscription to Newseek. They've gone downhill so much, from bad to worse. They've given up all pretense of objective, ethical journalism."
2,not very relaxing,I was surprised to hear how fast many of the tracks are- not very relaxing in a massage environment.
1,Not as pictured,"The item I received looked nothing like the one I ordered. It was just an empty, plain case."
4,Prank Phone Call Volume II,"Funny CD. You really need to start at the beginning and follow his progress. If you want some wholesome laughs, this is the cd for you. Great to share at family gatterings. The cd arrived 9 days after I actually ordered it, but it did arrive. I recommend that if you need it immediately you request priority service."
4,This is the book to have!,Detailed explanations of almost every computer related term out there. If you are not familar with the lingo then this book will explain everything you need to know. A great desktop reference guide.
2,Not water resistant,"This watch functioned well for the first 6 months. But now condensation and moisture forms on the inside of the dial window. And this problem has developed even though the watch case has never been opened, such as for a battery change. And the watch is not worn in the shower or swimming pool."
3,O.K. watch,This watch is kind of bulky for an average sized woman. Nothing bad or indifferent to say about it. I would order another watch thru Amazon.
4,Birthday gift,"My son loved the Curious George dvd, we wants to watch it every night before he goes to bed, he can't get enough."
3,different Sylvia,"I got this because I love Sylvia's voice from her Ian and Sylvia days. I expected something more like her solo Catfish Blues number. So I was unprepared for how different her 70's material was. It's not too folkie. It's more of the easy listening type you would like on a Crystal Gayle album. In fact Crystal later covered River Road, probably the best song here. Sylvia's version is much better. Sylvia is in fine voice and the song Tumble-Down Woman is reminiscent of her old days. The album's good but I'm just saying don't come with the Ian and Sylvia frame in mind. Interestingly Ian produced this."
4,Laminator,"This product has saved countless hours of waiting for materials to be laminated at school. The laminating sheets can be a bit pricey, however, I found a package at Sams for twenty dollars. Also, I lost a few pages because the machine jammed."
4,Great non stop music,"I'll keep it short n sweet, this cd is straight non stop disco with one song cutting into the next, its great for those long parties with no D.J. and only the sterio playing the music for you, but overall not bad to own in your collection if your into disco."
2,Not worth reading,"This book is junk. It doesn't take an Einstein to realize that if there is a spelling error on the second page (""hurrican""), there is a problem as far as the writing and/or editing of the book is concerned. Author Rosen frequently goes off on tangents about other similar killers which don't add much and there are 15 pages of excerpts from his other books at the end to pad out the book's length. Typical with Pinnacle true crime books, there are several nauseating pictures. At one point, there is a character introduced -- Wesley, brother of one of the two mentally-disturbed white trash the book is about -- and I have no idea about his history in the family! Terrible."
4,Case Logic DCB-16 Compact Camera Case (BLUE),"Case is made fine, however it is really small so it would only work for those really slim digital cameras."
3,"Very tiny, even for small cameras.","This case is nice in appearance, but it is a tight fit with my Fuji Finepix camera....which is a small camera. Most modern digital cameras are about the size of my Finepix, so I imagine a tight fit in general. The velcro flap closure only partly comes together as the camera sticks out slightly from the top. There is one very small pocket on this that might fit an extra battery or memory card. The case will serve its purpose however."
3,Too small!!!,"These are way too small. More like a cellphone case than a camera case. I have a *very* small, compact Olympus FE-350 and I could barely squeeze it in.They are of decent quality, just too small."
5,Phone Pranks,"If you like telephone call jokes you will love this cd. Rickey Smiley is very funny when doing telephone pranks, i like this you might love it to."
5,Men 212 is the greatest,I first got this product in Germany while visiting Europe and I used it on my trip and I had many women at Airports and in stores and even in Italy ask about it. When on a trip for a month and you have over 2 dozen ladies asked you what I was wearing I got the message real fast. I have use the splash for over 10 years.
1,"Not for children really, very busy word wise.","I odered this book and will now return it. It does not seem to be for children. Maybe older children, middle school and up. The book did not keep my attention I had to force myself to read it."
5,Like a Timex.....,"Have owned this bag for 7 years- it's a missile. Been overseas, traveled this country a lot, and has been to a number of dirty jobsites. This cleans up easily, has not frayed anywhere, and is truly solid. It fits my IBM T43 and my Lenovo T500, both leave the zippered edge underprotected, but has proven a non-issue. Also, the pouch where the pens & cords go should have been zippered, but again, not a deal breaker. I think the whole Trager line is great- my partner has the Transcontinental; the Twister is a bit more protective, and compact, & hers is way more versatile, secure, and equally professional."
3,You Can Turn it Into a Good Plane,"The reason I give this a lower rating than the others did is the amount of work I had to do on it. I expected to have to work on the blade so don't mind that it needed some flattening of the back before sharpening. What was unexpected was the poor line up of the rear hand seat with the blade bed. I had to use a chisel to remove material before filing then sanding.In the end it has turned into a very useful plane. The blade has held up quite well and holds sharpness well. It is very comfortable in the hands and I use it quite often. I don't use it as a smoother though. Instead, I use an ECE Primus Smoother for that. I've found I can use this plane to make quite thick slices when I'm taking a board down to desired thickness. The plane makes these aggressive cuts well without jamming with chips.Since the other evaluations made no mention of the blade bed problem, perhaps mine had an unusual problem. Given the low cost of the plane I still feel it was a worth while buy."
4,Uhh-pok-lipzz?,"So might say Doomsday, if he knew, or cared, where he was in this story which could be titled The Birth and Death of Doomsday. The art is flawless, and the story very good, with only a little bit of retconning. Or would that be ret-disconning? Whatever. The story has some ham-handed exposition, however. When Superman and Henshaw talk to their silent partners, they might as well be talking to themselves. This just really annoys me for some reason -- comic writers realized back in the thirties that characters can't talk to themselves every time the reader needs to know what's on their minds, couldn't we have come up with a better solution by now? Ah, well.Read this is you like the Boyscout and/or Doomsday, and if you don't mind the autolocution I've mentioned above, and if you don't know what Lamarckian evolution is and why it's wrong."
3,Pleased with Intermatic Landscape Lights,"These lights worked great in my landscaping. I have had them for probably five years now. However, the plastic they are made of has dry rotted from sun, heat and cold through the years. When I purchased my first set from Sears they carrried replacement parts, which was a good reason for purchasing. Now that I need replacement parts, I cannot find them. All I need is the white plastic center that the top snaps into. This clear/white plastic center is very brittle now and breaking after 5 years. I would highly recommend this product IF I could find a place to get replacement parts."
5,A keeper,"As a Physician Assistant student, I'm overwhelmed with many other poorly written books. I keep refering to this book to make sense of the many other subjects (such as labs and diseases) that I'm grappling with. This book does not ""dumb down"" the material, but rather presents it as it should be presented, thorough but to-the-point. I'm very impressed with this book and it's authors."
2,Don't buy this camera,"I bought this camera for the convenience and portability of the writable CD, but the laser was thrown off just 3 months after I bought the camera. Apparently, this camera has a high failure rate (1 in 10) because of the delicacies of the CD writable construction.One other negative aspect of the CD media is that writing to the CD is slower than to other memory devices and reading the CD (when previewing images in the camera) is also slow.I think there's more value in the Canon G2 - most of the same features, but with 4.0 Megapixels and a more solid construction. That's what I traded in my Sony MVC-CD250 for..."
2,poor remix to a very good song =(,"""you'er my heart you'er my soul"" is one of the best dance songs ever made (no exaggeration) but the remix was very bad, I rather listen to the original (this leaves room for some one to remix this song, and do a good job of it)"
4,Required Art History Reading,"One of my many art history courses required this text. In terms of college books it wasn't terribly turgid or otherwise bothersome to read. I've gone through some art history books that make me want to scream. This was far easier to navigate and read. (A silly thing to say I suppose, but art historians can write as though they wish us to not only become aware that they have a PHD but also hope to clue us in to where it was received; i.e. it really just becomes a pissing contest full of ostentacious writing, a whole lot of cerebral wanking and ego stroking)."
4,An Excellent Introduction to Statistics,"I retained this old (second edition first printed in 1985) handbook because it describes statistics so well. My review does not comment on the computer program.Good application examples are provided of such things as random numbers, Bernoulli trials, the binomial theorem, the Poisson distribution, and much more."
2,Not sure if it's effective,"After coming back from the petsitter's house the dogs were covered with fleas. Washed them with the shampoo and seemed working a little bit but not until we put Frontline Plus on them as well. Be very careful not to over use it, even for each bath. Pyrethrin can be toxic to sensitive dogs and this product seems having ten times of the Pyrethrin amount compared to Hartz flea & tick shampoo. The legs of one of our dogs, became paralyzed after the baths and didn't recover after 24-48 hours. Balancing the cost vs. benefit I might think twice using any Pyrethrin products on her. Living in the subtropical area personally I find sticking to the strict monthly schedule of Frontline Plus is pretty safe and effective in flea and tick controls."
5,What Men Need to Know About Women Who Are Healing!,"Grant Cameron and I argue constantly on the Internet on a number of subjects. However, this book was so right on target that I can find little to disagree with him. Grant's book helped me understand why my special friend is the way she is, and, in fact, the very things that she says are echoed by Grant from his own experience of helping his wife heal from childhood sexual abuse. The road to healing for the woman abused during childhood is hard and filled with difficulties, but partners may not be prepared for just how difficult the process may be on them. Grant has prepared an outline, a road map for those with the courage and concern to stand by the woman they love while she goes through the ordeal--and it is indeed an ordeal--of healing. If one is the same situation as Grand, they cannot do better than heed his advice and learn from his experiences."
3,Not Relevant to Everyone,"Although this book is somewhat helpful, it is, unfortunately, based mostly on the anecdotal experience of one couple [the author and his wife]. I think that Allies in Healing is a more helpful book - if you are looking for a book written mostly for spouses of survivors.To husbands: FYI - the healing is a very long and arduous process - it ain't pretty, and it really helps if you have a LOT of love and MORE stamina. If so, I highly recommend ""Women Who Hurt Themselves"" by Dusty Miller. It's a tough read, but will put things into a logical framework for you. This issue has a lot of gender implications in its understanding, and a logical framework seems to be essential for the male in the role of supportive mate."
1,Would make a zombie go on a hunger strike!,"It is a SHAME I HAVE to give this book even a single star!As a LOVER of zombie fiction, I thought I was getting a real deal when I picked this one out of a ""One Dollar"" bin at my local resale shop just recently.After about the first three pages though, I began to think I'd been overcharged. - After r. e. a. c. h. i. n. g. chapter two, I was sure of it.I like the premise, and I LOVE the idea of a zombie story being set in St. Louis (Hometown) but after slogging through THIS I am forced to conclude that the author is/wasA: Not a native speaker of English.B: High on grass while editing/spellchecking the story.C: Perhaps down with the flu the Day he wrote it.Or all of the above.Interesting cover art and not much else.Avoid unless you are training to be an author and looking for a guide on how NOT to write!"
1,How to write. A sentence.,"Somebody, give this kid a lesson in basic English. How can one have the temerity to write a book when one hasn't the slightest idea of how to put words together in some sort of coherent order. Or doesn't understand that words have specific and particular meanings. If you mean meandering, for pete's sake, say meandering. Not ""maundering."" What the heck is maundering? Is it stumbling around in the dark trying to find a complete sentence? Because if it is, then I maundered through this book. Not all the way through. No, after reading. About half of the book. I was overcome by the author's complete ignorance; of punctuation. I maundered over. To the wall and banged my head against it."
5,spartacus dvd,realy enjoyed it good production paul tifler is so sexy mmmm love him would love to see more of him
1,"If I could, I would give this 0 stars.","Horrible movie. Definately a ""B"" or perferably a ""C"" class movie. Only redeeming thing was it was a cheap purchase."
2,DON'T EXPECT TOO MUCH,"A remake, in any form, should offer something new (if not a better concept than the original). This mini-series lives up to ""mini"". Mini talent in almost every aspect: script, direction, music, acting. This version of SPARTACUS is pedestrain on all levels, except (possibly) the production level, (sets & costumes) it's not too shabby.Mr. Visnjic has the charsima of a carrot - Ms. Mitra, is a bore. Who would care about these two dullards (certainly not a force that challenged mighty Rome).The ""score"" is as rousing as elevator ""music"". The direction, that of a hack - a pick up your paycheck and have a beer at the corner saloon sort of thing.The fattie who played Batiatus is the exception in this mini effort - a good actor, a job well done.""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" SPARTACUS (1961) is a magnificent classic, (with an unbelievable cast: The late, superb, Simmons, Ustinov, Laughton, Olivier) not this mouse!"
4,Very useful,"We kept going to stores to buy this type of knife, get them home and discover we had purchased a streamlined butter spreader. These are sharp, well made knives, we actually accidentaly put one through a dishwasher cycle and guess what, it was still as sharp as when it came out of the package!"
2,Misleading Information,"This is Zwilling J.A. Henckels INTERNATIONAL brand, which means the product, most importantly the STEEL blade is made in CHINA and NOT GERMANY as stated in the product information. The real ones are the 4 piece set, which usually goes for about 20 bucks and change on cookingdotcom or any other reputable site. My mother bought a set of these and the blade on the green one snapped in half from a 70+ year old lady using it, that should say something as to the quality of the steel."
4,Finally!,"At last, Murder at the Vanities is being released. I saw this film years and years and years ago at a film festival with my mother and we fell in love with it becuase it's simply so outrageous and outrageously bad in some spots (the ""Marijuana"" number is especially entertaining).This has been on the top of my want list for years, desperately hoping someone would release it. Now that it's coming out, I think I know what my mother's getting for Mother's Day this year."
5,srh2767,"Good series. I started watch the colony a while back and didn't have a chance to see how it ended. I like how the producers picked a wide variety of people and how professionals would comment on how the group was doing as a group. I recommend this to anyone who is a ""prepper"" to see just how people will react in a real situation. It is good series to watch, but you can learn a lot from people and how they react in less than ideal situations."
3,interesting to say the least,"my best friend and i watched this one night, and it was cool. It seemed somewhat over acted, but it was hilarious when one of the dudes gets mad about everything, thinking he is more important than the rest. all in all was okay."
1,I had hopes for it....,"Rutles Highway Revisited is a tribute album to the pre-fab four by a bunch of unknown, New York area bands who, for the most part, are either really horrible musicians or just joking. Leppo could've done a better job."
5,Donald in Mathemagic Land - the DVD,"Unfortunately, this video has been shown to young children who cannot understand many of the math references. It is better for middle and younger high schoolers. It is great to use pieces of as the students learn about the math in the video (i.e. the golden rectangle, cones and spheres, etc.) This is the third copy I have purchased. Students keep borrowing it and forgetting to return it."
5,Great math movie for fifth and sixth graders!!,"As a teacher of upper elementary children for many years, I showed Donald in Mathmagic Land many times. It served as a springboard for studying different aspect of mathematics and for relating math to numerous areas of life. Students often had difficulty seeing the sense in learning math, but by watching this movie, their curiosity was piqued and they were inspired to do further study. Now that I teach math methods as a college professor, I show the movie to my preservice educators. They find it as interesting and useful as I do!"
1,Not too charming,"This book tells the same thing over, and over and over yet again. At times I thought I must have turned back the pages because I had already read the same words. The author makes a big thing about the red dots near Gerry's ear. When this is finally solved it takes up about half a line."
2,"colr is great, fitting is less",its a great colour but thew fitting is not that good.... but price wise a comment might not be appropiate
5,Character is first,"The foundation for this educational approach is described in this book. Our family has had the opportunity to live it and it works for parents and for their students. Is it difficult? Yes. This approach allows individuals to identify and release their unique potential and make a change in the world, through themselves."
1,Hyde School is not as great as it seems,I grew up across the street from Hyde School in Bath. When I was little I found used syringes on the campus. There were also several reported suicide attempts and students often ran away. I knew several local students who went there and were miserable. Hyde School and their methods should not be glorified.
5,A great re-read in August.,"This book is like a bunch of sticky notes, each with a great idea that you can pull out at any time and use. It's a wonderful reference tool and reminder for new and seasoned teachers alike. Every idea works!"
5,Spice it,"Yet another great single from The Spice Girls.They had a string of hits from 1997 to 2000.Its amazing how many hits they had in such a short period of time.This is another i often listen to.They weren't around for very long,but they did produce some classic songs."
1,Not For iMac,"I love Scrabble and was looking to put the game on my iMac. Although this particular product claims to work with MAC, it does not."
1,This apparently a 16-bit version written for Windows 3.1,"The version sent to me is apparently a 16-bit version written for Windows 3.1. Other stated system requirements are: processor: 486, 8 MB RAM, 2X CD-ROM drive, 5 MB free hard disk space, 640 x 480 display with 256 colors. This is in stark contrast to the higher system requirements being advertised. I'm returning the product with shrink-wrap intact for a refund."
4,Great Mix!!,"Another great ecletic mix of jazz, reggae, world music, funk, soul, rock, etc. Then the 2nd half of the cd is a live mix of hip hop disco, etc. Another solid madlib mix. Probably my favorite of his mind fusion albums."
3,Certainly not the best.,"Okay...but...buy Rick Steve's Italian phrase book instead. Much more relevant, great pronunciation guides, common everyday conversational items and even the humor is a good break in the studies. I already speak decent Italian, my wife did not, and she found Rick's guide to be much better in format and usability and was the one we chose to take to Italy with us."
3,interesting plot,"I have read alot of her books, though I would love to know if she has written anything recently?? This book had an interesting plot line, but the ending could have been better. Nonetheless, still worth reading."
3,Film Needed More Than Stunning Visuals,"Being a huge fan of Baraka, I eagerly awaited the theatrical release of SAMSARA this past weekend. Setting-aside the absolutely stunning imagery, I felt the film fell short in editing and thus the director's translation of diverse images failed to achieve a coherant experience for me.The producers seemed to stay with the Baraka model without significant innovation. I felt the editing contributed to a sense that each theme (war, globalization, natural world, etc.,) was not fully expressed or formed. In addition, the editing did not properly integrate with the musical arrangements to provide a more powerful emotional impact.If this is your first time seeing this type of work, you may feel differently, since the imagery and locations where the film was shot is worth the price of admission. Others may just be satisfied with the imagery and sound design as-is.Ron Fricke is probably one of the world's best cinematogrpahers and like Baraka, that is evident in SAMSARA."
2,IF YOU WANT TO READ STANDUP... BUY IT,"I expected more from Mo'nique when I selected this book. The book is hard to follow and unorganized. She fails to truly give solid advice to overweight women. The book is her stand up material. I have seen her in concert. If you have too, don't buy the book unless you want to READ her material. It is definitely a library checkout not a purchase."
4,Cute cookbook holder,"This is a very cute, but simple cookbook holder. I had been looking for a black cookbook holder and found this one, but soon afterward saw one at Target that was a little sturdier and wish I would have purchased this instead. It seems to do the job of holding up cookbooks, but wish it was a little bigger."
5,Again! again! again!,The toddlers in my life love this book and ask us to read it over and over again. Machines at Work follows some construction workers through a work day and through different phases of building. The illustrations are beautifully done - simple to understand what is going on and very interesting to these little persons learning more about the world around them.
5,I recommend to every new parent,I bought my copy of this book 11 years ago just after the birth of my first child. Two more children later and I still refer to it constantly. Every symptom and concern is covered and the guidelines are easy to follow. I constantly recommend the book to other new parents and give it as a gift often.
2,expectant mother who reads a lot,"I work at a bookstore and have had plenty of time to look through various books on Children's health. I don't think I would buy this book in the third edition because it contains only one short, uninformative paragraph about Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (the leading cause of death in infants). It also suggests placing ""young infants"" on their stomachs to reduce crying- a sleeping position which doctor's believe may contribute to healthy children dying in their sleep. If this information is so unreliable, I worry about the rest of it."
2,"In its time is was good, but it's out of date","As this book is nearly a decade old, it desperately needs updating. It makes little or no reference to attachment parenting, ""child-wearing"", or co-sleeping. Prescription information is woefully outdated. Current research on breast-feeding is obviously non-existent and the ear thermometer (a device available for over five years now) was, at the time of this book ""not yet available for public use."" In today's day and age, you should not have to risk your child's health relying on out-dated information."
4,Oh my god. I just pooped a J. A J for JESUS!,"This being the sequel to Tom Mabe's album ""Revenge on the Telemarketers: Round One"", he does mostly the same stuff in this album as he did in the previous one. Random telemarketers call him, and he puts on a big act trying to act as crazy as possible. Generally he has a pre-scripted act ready for them, as he confuses the telemarketers or at least puts them in uncomfortable positions. This is most evident when he makes it known that he's talking to the telemarketer while sitting on the toilet with the exclamation ""Oh my god. I just pooped a J.""The CD is a fun way to spend an hour or so, but the jokes get a bit old after 3 or 4 runs through the CD. This CD would be good on a road trip to help pass the time."
1,Absolutely Horrible,"I'm a huge ""Jerky Boy's"" fan , and when I saw this cd I thought it would be funny. A little twist to what the Jerky Boys did. I sat and tried to laugh at this , but found nothing funny about it. I think the funniest thing about this is that this guy really thinks he's funny. The characters stink and the tracks go nowhere. I've laughed harder at my nephew's ""Barny"" cd's. At least he has a character. I couldn't even trade this thing in for a quarter. A little advice to you Tom..... Mabe you should keep your day job."
1,Great DVD! Five STARS!!,"I love the DVD, wish it were longer.Had to send the first one back, damaged in mail.(per the one star)Quick return of good quality product.KUDO's to Amazon!! Why can't I edit the stars?"
4,read it 20 years ago ...,I read this a long time ago and found it a really interesting mix of astrophysics and fiction. And the central idea that drives the plot keeps coming back to me...so I wanted to read it again and so bought this copy. Haven't yet re-read it!
1,Disappointing,"The CD player lasted a whole 10 minutes. I am extremely disappointed with the durability and worksmanship of this prooduct. The microphones worked despite the CD not being recognized by the player, but no CD. I really liked the concept of this toy and wished it worked out because my daughter went wild for it."
1,Microphones broke within weeks.,"We asked for this for Christmas for our 3-yr old music-loving son. Grandparents were happy to buy it, and while it worked, my son loved it. The cd player is easy to use. So were the microphones, until, one by one, they broke within the first weeks of use. There was a poor connection from microphone to cd player to start with. Then one stopped working. We let it go because the other microphone still worked, but in a few weeks, that one went, too. He didn't use or play with it roughly, although the machine says it's made to be kid-tough. Apparently the cd player IS, but the microphones/their connections are definitely NOT. A big disappointment."
3,Sing Along CD Player,tough for little hands and durable but not as loud as I hoped it would be. Also priced way too high.
3,Fun while it lasted...,"We bought this 3 years ago for our then 2 year old. The microphones did not work great, but that was not what we wanted it for. It played CDs well and our 2 year old (and later his little brother) could work the buttons on his own to listen to music whenever he wanted. I would say it has gotten a fair amount of use during the last 3 years and has not always been treated with reverence, but I was still disappointed when it stopped playing CDs. I am about to replace it, though, as my younger one really liked being able to play music all by himself. I will purchase an adapter, though, as it does use up batteries quickly."
3,"Good Sound, but cd player stops randomly","I bought this for my 2 yr old daughter who loves to sing, but her 8 and 10 yr old cousins stole it and played with it all day. The sound from the microphone is good, but the cd player stops randomly. I am not sure if the kids keeps turing off the skip protection or not."
4,THE GAME OF GLOBAL DOMINATION,"Hasbro's PC ""Risk"" is a good but not great game. The sheer scale of ""Risk"" is a big part of its charm, and who can resist a bid to take over the world? But the battles themselves are handled a bit too simply, so that what should be exciting becomes routine after a bit. Ultimate Risk departs from the classic game in several ways, adding forts, rebels, generals, and a much more detailed and exciting battle resolution system, and is actually much superior to the classic rules. Overall, ""Risk"" is certainly fun and a quality production, one well worth its relatively low price tag. On the other hand, some other Hasbro computer games, like ""Battleship"" and especially ""Stratego,"" are far superior."
1,Don't Bother,"Don't buy this game. The dice rolls are not random, I can tell what the dice will land on even before they stop spinning. When a computer gets backed into a corner they begin rolling 6's left and right. Once I had 1 computer batallion slaughter 14 of my batallions...that just doesn't happen in real life.Only buy this game if you want hours of frustration."
5,A fascinating survey of world revolutionary influences,"Historical texts, eyewitness accounts, and analysis blend in Blood Of Revolution, a survey of a range of revolutions and revolts, from the French revolution to those in the Middle East and Cuba. Each revolution has its own dynamic and cast of characters but all result in betrayal, glory and death. A fascinating survey of world revolutionary influences."
1,False Advertising,"These labels don't say ""Hello My Name Is"" on them, as suggested by the picture on the product page. Very disappointing."
1,Liars,"Doesn't look like the picture at all, its just blank with a red border. They're just a bunch of liars."
5,Will Change your Mind!,"Must read for any developmental, cognitive, or educational psychologist. Actually, for any researcher interested in change (which should be everyone)! Siegler presents the microgenetic method of research based on overlapping waves theory and gives an immense amount of supporting evidence, both theoretical and research-based. He also explains HOW to implement this research method. Just makes me wonder why this method is still so rare to find in the literature."
3,OK but NOt as Good as the Reviews,"This keeps water cooler or frozen longer than a bottle that is not insulated, but from the other reviews I thought it would work much better than it does.I expect that there are other bottles that work better. I will not buy this product again and will try other brands until I find something that really works."
2,Terrible plastic taste,The bottle looks nice and fits in the hand nicely. The bottle has a terrible plastic taste that pretty much makes it useless unless you like the taste of plastic water.
3,Long Term? Not so great. I'm switching to a Stainless Steel Bottle,"I bought this water bottle a few months ago it was great in the beginning but after a wile its starting to wear out. I use mine everyday and carry it everywhere it made it through one semester at school and now its startign to leak. I have to tighten it really tight so it won't leak and even that is starting not to work any more. The valve is impossible to remove i just cant do it. I does stay cold but only for about 2 hours. Personally I can't wait to get an upgrade. I suggest skip anything plastic if you are going to use it all the time, if your just an occasional walker or something then this is ok for that."
4,"Not very well insulated, but gets the job done","Prior to this bottle I owned a stainless steel thermal bottle with a thick layer of air to insulate. It worked really great. Water (without ice) stayed cold overnight, even in Singapore's warm climate.With this bottle however, I could feel the cold of the water just seconds after filling it up. It's probably foolish to expect the foam layer to insulate as well as air, but somehow my expectations were a bit higher.Oh, and I'm still struggling to take out the removable spout."
4,"Decent Bottles, Camelbak might be better","I've been using these water bottles (24oz) for almost a year now. They are great in terms of keeping beverages cool (and as other comments suggest, sometimes too cold as they are still frozen by time you wish to drink from them). But mine are starting to leak quite frequently from the top. Camelbak makes similar bottles that I am sure close more securely, as this has been my overall judgement with Camelbak.Pros (+) and Cons (-)+ Capacity. Great to have 48 oz on a bike (two bottles)+ Insulation. Keeps drinks cold.- Leaky.- Somewhat hard to squeeze+ Valve comes off for cleaningOnce I get a few more bucks or the leaking gets worse, I will replace these bottles withCamelbak Podium Big Chill 25 oz Bottle, which are a little more expensive but will likely not have the leaking problems I am getting from these otherwise great bottles."
5,Great insulated bottle,"I've been using the 24oz. bottle at the gym for the last six months. It is the perfect size for a 60 minute spin class or an hour on the eliptical. I usually load it with a scoop of Accelerade drink mix, ice cubes from my ice maker and then fill it up with water. The ice melts at a much slower rate because of the insulation and have a cold drink throughout class. I also like the fact the material is BPA free, so one less thing to worry about. The little carry ring that fits between the cap and the body is real handy if your hands are full with other gym stuff. I tried using this the 24oz on my Specialized Tarmac bike but it is slightly too big for my frame (52cm). The 20oz might work better, but I usually drink quite a bit while riding, so sticking to non-insulated bottles for biking."
4,Good purchase,This water bottle works really good. We put ice in it and stays cold for much longer than ordinary water bottles. Easy to wash. Cool colors.
2,A styrofoam cup would be better,"I purchased this cup last week. As an experiment I decided to fill this bottle up with ice and leave it out for a few hours. When I came back the water was just cool, not cold, and all of the ice melted. I would move on if you want your water cold for more than 30 min."
3,"Makes ice last, but nozzle let's air in","Great for hot summer rides, but not that necessary in cooler weather.These bottles are hard to squeeze while drinking. And after two seasons, the nozzles are worn to the point that they let a lot of air in. Makes you uncomfortable and belch after drinking. Going to try Camelback bottles now."
4,Great Bottle for Golf,"I use this for golf and it really works good. About 2/3 full in the freezer and it keeps ice the whole round. The next one I buy will be 24 oz. though because, at nearly the same price, it provides more water."
2,Cold but wet,These polar drink bottles work fine when the seals aren't leaking. It is hard to tighten the lids so that they don't leak.
4,nice bottle,"I purchased this bottle because I was looking for a water bottle that would fit in to the side of my book bag (AKA diaper bag/travel bag)and that was also insulated. The water bottle is great. I loved that it is dishwasher safe and can be frozen. We used it almost everyday since purchase. Even in 90+ degree weather, it kept water cold. Ice would last at least an hour in the 90 degree weather(if kept out of direct sunlight). The only downfall is cleaning the actual bottle if gets on the inside. Yes, can be put in the dishwasher, but the grooves inside don't always get clean. I will occasionally use a water drink packet (like crystal light or propel) and some of power is still stuck on the sides. Need to go buy a baby bottle brush to see if that will help.I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a insulated water bottle! Price is good too. For the price of 2 cases of bottled water, buy this bottle and help the environment too!"
1,Cracks in the Bottle after a Year,"I've owned the Polar Insulated Water Bottle for a little over a year and the cracks have formed on the same spots on both sides of the bottle. This doesn't prevent the bottle from being usable, but I did not expect cracks to form in the material so soon.Here is a picture of the crack:[...]"
4,Kids love them,"This does a good job of keeping water cold. One of my kids loved the carrying strap and the other didn't, but it is easily removed.I had purchased one of these bottles last year and did have some trouble with a crack around the spout.My daughter loves the Save the Planet."
2,Not Worth The $$$,"Compared to a plain old $5.00 water bottle from any bike shop, this did not live up to expectations. I have had no problems with leaks as others have had. But, the only thing I put in it is water.Filling up two water bottles the night before about 2/3 full & freezing them - then topping off with cool water in the morning, this Polar Insulated Bottle lasts NO LONGER than an ordinary water bottle available from any bike shop or even discount store. They both started to thaw at the same rate. Insulated? Not hardly."
5,Good Purchase,I am getting really good use out of the 2 bottles I ordered. Great price and no complaints.
2,Not recommended,Two of the 5 bottles I purchased leak the liquid on me when I drank from it. I've tried to reposition and make sure the top is securely twisted on but this did not seam work and still leaks.
3,cheap but cant hold water cold for too long,"This bottle is not bad for a NORMAL plastic water bottle that you can find anywhere, but not too great for its insulating quality. It doesn't hold liquid cold long enough when I go for bike rides. though, it fits well on my bike and did not leak."
4,Insulated Water Bottle that Works,"This is the second water bottle I've used to accompany me on golf outings where I'm walking. I had intended to only purchase one bottle but as it happened the ice in my first try at a water bottle would have melted and the water would be warm by the second hole. This bottle is much better, though not perfect, and keeps the water cold for nine holes on a hot day. This is all the insulation I need because there are usually several chances to swap out the water, though not ice, during each round. It is also mandatory that the bottle doesn't ""sweat"". As far as I'm concerned, the longer the cold lasts, the more stars -- it ain't perfect but for the dough its great!"
3,Looks great but is second to another brand in performance.,"It is too hard to squeeze the bottle in order to force water out (And no I'm not a weakling). This is important if you intend to use this product while riding. Hate to point buyers in another direction, but the Camelbak works much better for cycling. They both are about equal at keeping things cool.Hopefully, this comment will only result in Polar redesigning this into a better product."
2,Good For Awhile,"I've had this bottle for roughly two years, and I've really loved it. However, I've just discovered a serious design flaw that others should know about. I put something in it and then left it out at room temperature. Not smart. It got moldy. That would not necessarily be a problem, but when I tried to wash it out I discovered that it has a lot of dimples inside the bottle that are extremely hard to clean. I then bought a bristle brush to wash it out with, costing me almost as much as a new bottle would. In retrospect, I should have tossed it and replaced it with a smooth interior stainless steel bottle. I really loved this bottle and am sorry to have to give it a bad review."
3,water bottle,The Polar Insulated water bottles keeps the water cool through a 2 hr tennis game in medium heat. The design is good for holding but the looks of the container is subpar compared to other brands. The nozzle works well but I'd like to see the size just a little bigger.
3,Keeps water icy cold but leaks,"Love this bottle as it can be be put into the freezer and doesn't warp and gets misshapen like the metal bottles. And the water is icy cold for hours. But be careful about putting it into your tote bag. The cap loosens and the water drips out of the bottle. This has happened twice. I had no idea the second time that the water was dripping onto the floor of the bank I was at. I saw the bottle leaking in my tote bag and my checkbook was soaked. I was embarrassed. It's a good thing my suede bag is cleanable.Just beware that may be a problem for you because it's just a plastic cap without a rubber seal, so it is not watertight."
3,Disappointed,"It barely kept my water cold for an hour.Besides that, I love this bottle because it is the perfect size."
5,"Yeah, it works!","Yes, this bottle actually keeps fluids colder than a regular bottle. Holds alot, and the top screws off for easy refill. Well built, and sturdy in its design. Easy to use. I will probably buy more. This is a great water bottle, and you cannot beat the price!"
5,Tested in the Hot Florida sun*,"This is the best water bottle, ever, for keeping the drink inside it, Cold. Even after hours on the beach this bottle keeps its promise to ensure a cold drink. In 4-5 hours the drink, in our case water, is almost at room temperatute but that is still good.We first fill it with ice cubes and then with cold water and it work very well. The shape is good too, it has an easy grip and pours nicely into ones mouth. If it had a loop handle like the smaller bottle, this one would be perfect."
5,My favorite water bottles,"I've been a biker for almost 30 years, and the Polar insulated bottles are my water bottles of choice. From the insulation, to the easy-grip ring, to the no-drip performance, they do what they're supposed to do better than any other water bottles I've used. I highly recommend them."
2,Difficult to change lightbulb.,"The pendent light is beautiful once installed, but, changing the lightbulb takes two people on stepladders. It involves completely removing the globe, inserting the bulb inside of globe, pulling the socket down, then reattaching the globe to the socket."
2,Ok for the first semester....where's the rest?,"Covers the theory and mechanisms well enough to be an introduction and quick review, and helps when all the textbook seems to be doing is put you to sleep. However it only covers (and perhaps this is only true at this university, although I doubt it) the first semester of orgo. It covers alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes well, but barely (if it all for some of them, and even when it does, does not cover enough reactions) covers the second semester topics like carboxylic acids, aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, phenols, amides, esters, etc which tend to be the parts of the course where people are more likely to see their grades fall. Might be ok if there were a volume 4, 5, and 6 on the way to supplement."
3,disappointed,"This is the third Monopoly for computer game I've purchased and it's just not what I hoped for. I still can't find a version that gives you a full screen for play. When you click ""max"" on this the gameboard stays small, you just get a big white background. What's the point? Also the game seems just as buggy as the other two I've bought. I'm a serious Monopoly fan so as of now I don't plan to return it. But you'd best believe I will continue my search for a better one."
2,not cool,if you like a simple game of monopoly then you would probably like this to me the graphic looked old and i just like the newer stuff like here and now monopoly for pc its like a newer generation design
1,Not White!,These bulbs are no way near white when installed. It is a distinct yellow so don't waste your money and time!!!
5,Good Book,It is a good book to help someone learning electronics or for someone trying to get back into electronics. It is good to have to refer back to if needed.
5,Wonderful addition to our collection,"High quality, realistic, healthy play food. We have healthy dinner, healthy lunch, and breakfast from Learning Resources. All high quality and I would highly recommend. Hands-down way better quality than anything you'll find at the big box stores."
1,Beware of small items,"When we opened this, my daughter and I immediately ""disappeared"" the carrots. Warning: they are a serious choking hazard. I'm shocked they were included. The rest of the items are OK and two children (ages 1 and 3) have had fun playing with them."
1,Poor quality & missing Activity Card,"This toy is unlike the other Learning Resources toy. It's made of soft plastic & has a smell. The carrots are too small. I don't like it. The food items don't look very real. In fact, some looks awful. The Activity Card is missing from my package. But thanks to Amazon's customer-centric service, they gave me a refund. You can give this a miss. Too costly for the poor quality."
2,Smaller than I expected,"Cost as much to ship as it cost, don't know why they used a big box, could have used an envelope"
4,excellent fit for canon sd1100,It's a perfect fit for the canon sd1100. The lcd screen protector adds confidence. I would buy this again.
3,Good content - Far too many errors,"Although most of the subject matter in this book is excellent, I was extremely disappointed by the sheer number of typographical and factual errors in the book. Most seriously, a number of the multiple choice questions have incorrect answers, as do some of the questions on the CD. This could seriously confuse someone attempting to learn by doing the test questions. The CD based questions also contain subjects that are not covered in the exam (SANs and VoIP).I also felt that the practical exercises were a last minute addition, as they are in the appendices when they really should be integrated with the relevant chapters (or those chapters should advise you to do the exercises). The errata for this book runs to around four pages, showing that it was compiled in a hurry with minimal proofreading to get it out at the same time as the new exams. I would have expected better from Cisco Press. Next time, I will probably buy Sybex instead."
5,Coming at you through right angles only.,"This is a great cd. I love the atmosphere this kind of music creates epic doom driving into your soul. The music creeps in and occupies space. The songs on this cd generate soooo much atmosphere that, when they stop, if feels like all the air has been sucked out of the room.This was the first Doom cd I bought and since then I picked up music from Sunn, Yob, Earth, Boris and Esoteric. If you like any of these bands then I recommend this monolithic masterpiece. All hail mighty Cthulhu."
5,Reads like a Woody Allen screenplay,"Brilliant! Satirizes Worry Worts! I swear the author had spycameras in my parents home when I was growing up! Jewish people should especially relate to this book. Loved the diversified portfolio 50 different funds, 2% of total portfolio!A must read for laughs!"
3,Treasure Island,"Treasure IslandI thought that treasure island was a very good book if your looking for adventure, betrayal and Plenty `o' conflict. I definetly recommend this book to anyone willing to read it."
4,Slide rule tells time!,"Excellent watch- attractive, sturdy, never needs battery, waterproof to 200 metre. Nice to have dual-time feature and circular slide rule. However- slide rule type size a bit small (or my glasses need new batteries)."
3,Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Nighthawk Watch #BJ7000-52E,"I seems like a really copy, I bought this watch because I like so much but I have seen another one the same style only diffrent name and it is called Citizen Men's Eco-Drive promaster with better quality, for example the cover of the machinery is totaly different, the watch has hologram I don't know If there is another model but it seems better than Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Nighthawk Watch #BJ7000-52E that I bought and also there is a card warranty certified (it is like a credit card) and this product does not have it."
4,Great watch,"I've only had the watch for a few weeks but I love it. The slide rule is not really useful as a practical application but can be fun to play with if you have good eyesight. The fact that there are so many numbers for the slide rule makes the watch face somewhat busy and therefore a little hard to read. Otherwise, the Eco-Drive is great, the watch keeps good time, and it looks great."
1,Threaded crown is JUNK!!!,"I've had this watch for about 5 months now and the threaded crown or body stripped, so the crown no longer locks in place. I've tried contacting Citizen for waranty and they say it's not covered. Citizen claims that I over tightened it or cross-threaded it while screwing down, so it will cost $50-100 to repair.TOTAL JOKE! I'll never purchase a Citizen watch again. I've always thought they were cheap to begin with. This just confirms my thoughts."
4,packaging tape,"Not much to say other than good price and this will last me a long time. Good general purpose tape, but mostly for packaging goods."
1,"Weak, Low Quality Tape","I bought this tape because it seemed to be the best deal by far on Amazon. Now I understand why it was so cheap. This tape is very thin and flimsy so I end up layering it on over box seams. I don't really trust that one layer alone will hold boxes closed. But the worst thing about this tape is that it splits. Every 2nd or 3rd time I use this tape it splits when I peel the end up to start it. This is extremely obnoxious, frustrating, and time consuming. Not to mention a waste of tape because I have to throw out the pieces that get mangled. So in the end, when you factor in the extra tape you use because the tape is not strong enough, the tape that is wasted when it splits into pieces, and the extra time spent dealing with these issues, it is NOT a bargain."
5,Best tape ever.,"I occassionally just need to ship things or tape up boxes for storage and got tired of using the smaller cheap tape dispensers. So I got a real tape dispenser from Scotch and decided to go with their branded tape. Basically, it works extremely well. You might think there isn't much to tape. But if you've bought some of the cheaper brands and tried to use a lot of it... you'll understand. There is nothing more annoying that having the tape get stuck, comes off of the roll in ""strands"" rather than all together, or doesn't do it's basic job. Which is to simply be ""sticky"" and hold things together. Quite a basic function of course, but some tapes just can't get it done.I've already gone through about a dozen rolls of this Scotch tape in the past year and haven't had any issues. You'd be surprised how often you need to tape things up. So go with the good stuff. And at the prices here on Amazon to buy a 6-pack, you really have no reason not to."
3,Was so hopeful...,"I was so hopeful that this would do what all of the excellent reviews said it would do. Unfortunately, it really didn't do much for me that a cup of coffee wouldn't. Disappointed. No increased focus, no extra energy. Curious from other users: Does it take awhile to build up in your system? Or if it was going to work should it work the first time?"
1,iSatori = I sorry.....,"...that I wasted money on theses things. I'm a male in my mid-forties. I suffer from lethargy, memory problems, lack of focus & energy among other things. Very often, I can nap even after getting a full night's sleep. I get a little foggy/dizzy sometimes too-usually after eating food. I was hoping these would provide me some get-up-&-go, which got up and left a long time ago. But they didn't. :(YMMV, but I'd start somewhere else if I were you. I just ordered Optimum Nutrition Opti-Men Multivitamins, & Gaia Herbs Adrenal Health, & Amazing Grass All Natural Drink Powder, Green Superfood, wish me luck...."
2,"Works ok, nothing special","These do give you a little boost, to me it felt about the same as a cup of coffee. They've made me a little queasy so I use them only when I'm really feeling sluggish. Can't really recommend them."
1,Useless Stuff!,"After reading the other reviews about this product, I expected way more from this stuff. But the irritating truth is, these pills had no effect on me at all. I've been into vitamins & herbal supplements for nearly 30 years and there are no ingredients in large enough doses in this product to significantly energize any adult in normal health.Don't waste your money on this junk. You'll get far, far more from a good supplement containing Guarana, Kola Nut, & Cayenne Pepper or a bottle of 5-Hour Energy."
2,Ehh...,"Not very strong at all. I wish I could get a refund, but alas... Oh well. Back to what works- ephedra."
3,The jury is still out,"I do not get the jitters, but I can't tell if I have more energy or not. I'll post again if this changes"
1,Dissapointing,"Being very favourable it could be called a code listing. But the code is incomplete, the naming of the variables and methods seem almost purposefully misleading and the actually logic in some of the code is just off.Avoid."
4,Buy this,"If you really liked Bust-A-Groove and Parappa, get this game. The main control in this game is on the analog control sticks. you have to memorize the movements (which is kinda easy) and put it together with your dancing character. It has a good collection of songs from the 70's 80's and 90's (Gotta love We Are Family) the Broadcast scenes are very very cool with neat camera angles and cool costumes. The story is a bit weird with an interesting cast and the voice acting is ok. If you want a fun game with booty shaking dancing and fun songs get this, you won't be disappointed"
4,Better Name than Book,"I do have to say, I enjoyed the first half then got bored with it. My husband however liked it....guess I thought with the name it would be more exciting. I did learn a lot of the history of Cumberland."
4,Cumberland Island,Well done. Covered the subject and the history very well. Book was asrepresented and on time.
4,Ok,"First I should say that the product arrived on time and as described by seller...but if, like me, you want to add a switch in between the socket and the bulb, you should know that it doesn't work since the sucket won't hold in the wall plug, it is too heavy and the connection is too loose. Anyways, there is nothing wrong with the product, except that the only you'll have to turn off the light, will be to unplug it, not very convenient when the bulb is hot and it might easely break during the process."
3,The Dark Knight is gone,"I have a sneaky feeling the 1960,s Batman TV show was loosely taken from thie serial.Gone is the dark ora of the Batman. In this sequel they are now partners with the police.Not wanted by them. I prefer them as vigilantes. This serial lacked the energy and excitement of the first one. Sure wish they got Lewis Wilson back for this one. Worst of all Robin is now college age.Too bad.Keep Robin the ""boy"" boy wonder.All in all it will do for those who love action and adventure with Halloween costumes."
2,You gotta be kidding me!,"Somebody has a lot of nerve with the cover art to this dvd, not only with a cool, Keaton-esque Bat-costume, but the modern-day Robin suit (with green leggings, etc.) to boot! The actual serial has hands-down the worst Batman costume in cinema history (his bat-ears stick out at an angle on the sides of his head, like devil-horns), and looks NOTHING like this artwork! Talk about bait and switch! The serial itself is mildly entertaining in an extremely chintzy way, though far inferior to the earlier BATMAN serial, which had a much better costume, but was also extremely racist (we were in the middle of WW2 when it was made), which may be why it still hasn't debuted on dvd. The best part of this serial is the moment where Batman reaches behind his back and pulls out a HUGE welding torch (supposedly from his utility belt) to try and open a steel door. Funny stuff."
5,Schubert Overheard,"I first owned Schnabel's recording of the D959 on a 78 set, and in those far-off years heard him play another in a recital in Baltimore. The Schnabel vogue -- in terms of attendance at recitals -- had definitely waned. But those who were there were deeply happy people. I have never seen a soloist who gave so much the impression of playing for himself and a few other people; it was as though you were in his home. No one could have been less the Great Virtuoso, more the quiet sharer. And there's an intimacy in his playing of Schubert that no one else quite matches, for me at least. Someone has said that poetry -- unlike rhetorical prose -- is ""overheard."" So with Schnabel's playing, and especially his Schubert. We were privileged to overhear it. And still are."
1,THEY BREAK!,"The one I got the pieces that attached the lid to the bottom broke off so now the garbage man flings the lid where ever he wants when throws the can down. Something extra to have to pick up now.I called Rubbermaid customer service and they were less than sympathetic, basically said tough luck, yea my luck is tough but the plastic they use sure isn't. AVOID!"
3,Product fine...shipping not so good,"I ordered one and of course it came broken. I ordered 2 the next time and with a bunch of other stuff. Well, it was shipped in an Amazon box but 1 of the 2 was broken. Good thing I ordered 2 the 2nd time. Wish I could have picked this up at Home Depot but no dice."
4,Profound but Readable Poetry,"Laurie Sheck's ""The Willow Grove"" is a collection of poetry for our western society as we enter the new millenium. Her poems mix the mythic and the metaphysical with current urban images. Sheck can make a TV with the volumn turned down haunt us. She can make us confront our own loss of innocense through portraying a child's view of an adult cocktail party.While Sheck's poetry is often dark and contains mythological references, it is extremely readable, even for readers who have not encountered poetry since high school. Reading it makes one realize what a shame it is that books of poetry so rarely make the best seller lists."
4,love the music from this era and this group does a good job.,This is the music from my time love it listen to it over and over Would recommend it to anyone
2,Limited Capability,"Installed this to interface the steering wheel controls on my 2006 Ford F-250 with my new Kenwood DNX9140 Nav Receiver. Of the 4 steering wheel controls only the volume up and scan up work as they did witht hte original Ford radio. Volume down mutes the volume instead of stepping it down and mode will only select the FM bands on the Kenwood receiver and none of the other mode options such as AM, DVD/CD, XM etc. The manufacturer's technical support was very fasr but only verified that the interface device had not been tested with the Kenwood DNX9140. It would be nice if the manufacturer would specify which specific units from the various manufacturers the interface had been tested with!"
1,Does not work!,"I bought this product, and had to return it because it didn't work. The installer called the manufacturer and the manufacturer told me to return it."
5,excelente producto,"excelente producto recomiendo 100% buy buenos vendedores, facil de instalar de ecxelenta calidad, empresa muy cumplida y buen precio nada sobrelimitado"
2,Working then Not working properly,"So it was a little difficult to install with different directions in the package and online and on forums, so goodluck with that part. Finally it was installed and work properly for a couple of days, but now it changes stations, volume, and mutes every time i turn or hit a bump. I have went through and checked all connections but it is the unit. I am so disappointed in this product. I think i will see if they will take it back and i will buy one of the other options out there. Don't buy one of these! more trouble then it is worth."
4,steering remote,"This was difficult at first to set up the instructions in the package were not that good.The customized instructions on line made the install much easier.The controls are not as good a the OEM, but they are usable."
2,SLOOOOW Response - Installed on a 2007 Honda Pilot,"I installed the SWI-JACK on our 2007 Honda Pilot to work steering controls for the new Kenwood DNX-9140. The instructions were extremely difficult to follow and since our steering wheel radio controls have the 'mode' button, it wasn't clear if the black/red wires needed a capacitor or not (it states 'may or may not need a capacitor' and nothing on what dictates the need. The brown and red wire must be grounded though. Once programmed and installed, the unit is very slow to respond with the Kenwood deck. I wish I would have saved the $50 on something else! Spend your money elsewhere if you're installing on a Honda!!!"
1,It didn't work for my G35.,"It took me 1 hr to remove the stickshift panel, the dashboard, the driver lower panel and the glove compartment for my infiniti G35. If you are a G35 owner, then you know how it goes. Another 30 minutes to remove, install and tested my new sound system. I had no problem following the online instructions and installing the PAC SWI-Jack. Thus, I can't get it to work. the program part wasn't difficult. The problem is that it doesn't recognize the G35 stereo wheel control. 3 hours later, I decided to pack it up and return it to Amazon."
4,Pretty good,"Note: I had a Best Buy Car tech install this.That being said, he did an overall fine job with my system, and the controls work well. For some reason he couldn't get the thing to go up the presets list, only down though.But that's my only gripe. This thing saved me over $60 vs. buying the Best Buy one that wouldn't have worked on my '01 Jetta (According to the manufacturer, who was not the same as this one)"
1,Don't buy this book,The book you get is not the book shown. It is a paperback and it is the international edition. At lease the seller got the subject right. Stuck with the book due to classes have started last week.
1,Preview first - way too graphic for our family,"I had intended to use this book to help my 7-year-old but when I previewed it, I found it to be a case of ""too much too soon."" It appeared the author tried to address every conceivable way a child might encounter death but, for my child, it would have introduced MANY more fears than it alleviated. Many of the illustrations were especially disturbing. Having a child wail ""can we keep our house?"" as the obituaries float around the picture was too much. Introducing death by substance abuse and suicide was too much. Discussing the donation of eyes to an eye bank or having the word ""autopsy"" in the glossary was too much. For young children facing death and the grief process for the first time, I would use extreme caution if considering this book. My child would have had nightmares for ages."
5,"Powerful, quietly haunting re-interpritation of real events","The true story of the kidnap of Italian political leader Aldo Moro by the Red Brigades in1978 is turned into a haunting, disturbing tone poem of a film.Eschewing realism, or the obvious tense, linear approach, this focuses on the experiencethrough the eyes of one the young kidnappers, and her ever growing doubts about therighteousness of the mission. But rather than express this literally, we see it emerge indream sequences, and behind her eyes.Beautifully shot, with a terrific use of classical and modern music (Pink Floyd shows upmore than once) this quiet nightmare of a film is far more effecting and thought provokingthan most political dramas. It doesn't miss the irony that Aldo was a humanist who wasactually inviting the communist party to be part of the government at the time.A great cautionary truth based fable about the danger of giving yourself completelyand unquestioningly to any ideology, left or right, religious or secular."
5,I love it and it's so hard to find,"This has been my fragance for so many years, I hardly ever use a different perfume, and it's soooo hard to find. I got a sample about 20 years ago and have been hooked since. I'm so glad I found it here at such a low price, so I've just ordered 4 of these babies."
1,Leviton 80405-W 2-Gang 1-Toggle 1-Decora/GFCI Device Combination...,Cheap brittle plastic. Waste of money would not buy again. ............. ............... ................. .............. ............... ................ .......... .......... .......... .........
2,Unacceptably poor editing for a Bible,"I like everything about this Bible -- the wide margins, the thin format, even the mustard cover -- except that I've only gotten through a few books and have already found 25 typographical errors, including errors in the text itself. I haven't encountered anything that seriously disrupts the sense of the text (yet!), but what I've seen so far does not inspire confidence. This Bible is well-packaged but shoddily edited."
3,Brunswick Target Zone Single Purple/Black 1 Ball Bowling Bag,This item is adequate. My size 10 shoes only just fit.Not really purple (Thank goodness).
5,Great way to spend some time,"These stories are lots of fun to watch. Sure, it's funny that all of the murders just happen to take place where one of the detectives are involved, but it's entertainment at its best, in my opinion.Great way to spend some time."
3,335?,"I am not the greatest guitarist by any means but this guitar definitely pulls through with the right amp. Humbuckers pull through on either end, great blues tone and decently versatile. No binding on the F-holes on my alpine white but its is the low end. Good playability for a cheap epi."
2,Tender Is The Night-not really helpful,"well, the Cliff's Notes for this book is kind of confusing. It doesn't go ""chapter-by-chapter""... only by ""Book 1,Book 2, and Book 3""-so it is hard to follow a long."
3,Decent,"I bought this gun to keep in my boot when I play airsoft as a weapon of last resort.So far Ive actually yet to take it out in the field, but it may at some point save me. I should also say that the gun can hold seven shots, eight if you force them, not the ten that it is said to. Also, it is difficult to have the green gas charge actually shot of all seven or eight times. The rate of fire is slow and the range is less than an average pistol. It has all plastic parts except for the trigger and the small green gas tank (the safety may be metal im not to sure). With all this in mind, it does serve its purpose as a last resort weapon and it is relativly cheap, id recomend this if you were looking for a last resort weapon, not really good for anything else though. (and the bad english in the instructions is exceptionaly funny)"
5,Grant Green Groove Master,"Although he received flack about these later albums they are still great. This is my favorite of his funkier albums. Idris Muhammad keeps the funky beat going throughout. The three bonus tracks are all smokers. ""Hey Western Union Man"", ""It's Your Thing"" and ""Maiden Voyage"" are all excellent tracks. I just wonder why they were not issued originally. Since these tracks were all good I did not mind upgrading to the reissued version. I wonder what other goodies from Mr. Green are still in the vaults at Blue Note."
4,Good Read,"From the first moment I heard about this book, I was ready to read it. A friend of mine who teaches English in New Orleans told me about the book and I immediately bought it and couldn't wait to read it. The book didn't let me down. I will say it didn't blow me away either, but I really like Nick's writing style and the whole idea behind what he was doing. I finished the book in less than a week and I feel pretty sure anyone reading it could finish it in a few days. I did get a bit lost in all the New Orleans bounce artists/rappers/singers/personas after a while, but overall he did a pretty good job. I think he could have been a bit more descriptive in some cases, but overall he touched on what I've felt about New Orleans for many many years, as far as the color divide. Anyways, please get this book and try it out, you won't be upset."
1,Awful!,"Wow, this is just one of the most boring books ever! I am a huge fan of the Royal Diaries and I wanted to read this book really badly, but it ended up being awful. The main character is really dull. She describes the Mayan culture the way a textbook would. There isn't really much to the story. Instead she describes boring things that have nothing to do with it. I would suggest that no one read this book, even if you love the Royal Diaries series."
3,bla...,"You have no idea how long I have waited to read this book. But, when I read the reviews my fears were starting to be confirmed. Ann Kirwin's other book, Victoria was just plain awfull! I hoped that this book would be better. Well, I started to read the first few pages and was not impressed. My mind soon wandered and I put the book down. I haven't picked it up sense. i've thought about continueing reading it but it's like their is some invisable force that just won't let me do it. Well, from all it's bad reviews I may not ever read it. ROYAL DIARIES ROCK! This one isn't worthy of the series."
5,Awesome,Lady of Palenque is a brilliant and highly sofisticated book. I found learning about the Mayan culture to be very exilerating. The plot is sometimes intense but I thourghly enjoyed reading it and I can't wait till the next Royal Diary comes out. I believe that my opinion is sound because I actually bothered to read all of the book and I didn't put it down after the first page.
4,"Spot-On, Right-On",I have used this product on my horse for more than a year and he has done extremely well. He has a severe allergy to fly bites and the Equi-Spot has allowed him to be more comfortable especially in the hot humid days when the flies are exceptionally bad. I have noticed that he no longer gets welts on his legs and on the underside of his neck from fly bites. He is a much happier horse.I will continue using Equi-spot as long as my horse benefits. The only reason I did not give this product 5 stars is the fact that once it is applied you have to be really careful not to touch the areas where applied. It usually takes a few days for the product to soak in and the residue to go away at the application sites.
2,NO RANDOM (???),"Just boggles my mind.Pro:Great quality. Yes, it really is. Good contrast. Good colors. It really stands out in comparison to my other frames.Cons:NO RANDOM... I don't get it.. Every single frame I've had and given to my family members has random playback. This one does NOT. I have the newest firmware (dated April'09). Drives me NUTS. I don't get it - how could they have skipped such an important feature on a picture frame?"
2,Watched only half the movie..,Writing was poor and Jeff's character was mis-casted big time. Half way through the movie I was done and could not watch anymore.
3,"Ok, but not really worth it","The streaming quality was fine. The movie had it's moments that were cute. But overall, I found it to be rather drab. Aside from the awful camera style, the thing I disliked the most was the dialogue written for the female characters (especially the mom's office friend). It felt like a man writing words for a woman without actually knowing how women speak (as if it is all that different from how men speak).In a nut shell, the main character is likable and Jason Segel was funny, but that wasn't enough for me to like the movie and not enough to where I'd recommend it to others."
4,Post-slacker dramedy hits target,"I quite enjoyed the vibe of the film. Basically, a family that never quite recovered the loss of a father has become dysfuntional as a family unit and as depressed as individuals. Things get worse and then they get better - mostly due to Jeff the slacker's adherence to his philosophy of interpereting and following metaphysical signs.The cast is a huge strength here. The script is quirky but the characters are realistic and likeable despite their faults. The ending provides a great resolution to the ideas and problems presented in the first act, tying it all together through the viewpoint of the protagonist.Its not exactly the kind of movie that I plan on watching over again, but it is solid."
2,Moments of brilliance...clashed by sadness,"I really wanted to enjoy this movie, but I was left letdown. It had some scenes that were hilarious, but in the end, it just wasn't something I could enjoy!"
5,Jason Segel and Ed Helms show their best and most tender performances of their career,"I thought this was going to be a low budget quirky typical pothead movie. Then five minutes in You get the feeling that there is something of substance to the story a head. The story becomes very deep without losing god's own good humor. The story a performances from Jason Segel, Ed Helms will make me long time fans of their craft. This is a movie for and about what family's ARE, difficult to understand and accept each other for who and what they are. Susan Sarandon is great. This movie is very funny and very deep not to mention flawlessly acted. Worth the time, money, tears and thought. Not like any other movie......if that helps at all. 5 stars for the performances. 5 for the story plot based on, funny enough, Mel Gibsons Signs."
2,Thank God it was free...,This was a strange film not meant for the masses. Tries to be independent and edgy but comes off as strange.Susan Sarandon character: What?Jason Segel's character: Huh?Ed Helms' character: Grow a pair!
3,Somewhat Juvenile Presentation,The surprise may be offensive to some. The brothers's story is better than the movie. Enjoyable if you have nothing else to do and need to kill some time
2,"Re-hashed story, horrible directing","Jason Segel slept walk thru his role. Ed Helms was ""the Nard Dog"" from the Office with a goatee. The Sarandon/Don-Chong story line was completely predictable and boring. The whole movie lacked the discipline to properly tell its story. A story of how somehow being a slacker, pot head, slightly off center dude has more direction in his life than his lonely mom that sits in a cubicle all day long and his ""successful"" marriage on the rocks, salesman brother.It just tried too hard to be indie...and it most certainly failed. The final scene made me throw up a little in my mouth."
3,"It's ok, could've been better","It's an entertaining movie but it's just blah at most times... Just an OK movie. If you have nothing else to watch, sure..."
1,Couldn't make it through the movie,My 21 year old daughter rented this and even though she told me it wasn't any good I decided to give it a try. But I only made it through the first 30 minutes before giving up on it.
3,Not bad,"One of those movies that takes place all in one day...it was an enjoyable watch. Showcases a mother and 2 grown children that have grown apart. In one day, events will start to bring them back together."
3,I liked Jeff but not the mom,"The story line was interesting and amusing. I especially liked the dynamic of the two brothers. Jason Segal played his part flawlessly. He was such a likeable character. Judy Greer, as Ed Helms's wife, always does a good job. This could have received 5 stars but the relationship of the mother and her co-worker was stupid - and did not make any sense. It really did not have a place in this film - seemed forced to me. What point were they trying to make? Why?"
4,Lasting Legacy,"I worked with Dr. Bernice Eiduson many years ago.One night recently, I actually dreamed about her. On waking, I wondered where she was. I googled her and was shocked to find she died many years ago. I bought her book as a way of reaching back in time. The book is her legacy. It is a good one."
5,a window on another world,"I picked up this cd because of a family connection with the Black Madonna of Monserrat. She's an integral part of the religious life of my dad's hometown. I thought the cd would make a good present for my dad but I didn't really expect the music to be anything special. However, I was simply blown away upon listening to it. This is an incredible blend of voice, rhythm and percussion that conveys the earthiness and transcendence of peasant pilgrim experience. I'm not a fan of early music -- I don't dislike it, I just don't know that much about it. Most of the early music I have listened to, however, is nowhere near as textured and intricate as these songs. What's amazing to my ears is that arrangements manage to sound both ancient and startlingly contemporary at the same time. I'm betting that sooner or later, someone will be giving these songs a trance-music treatment -- if that hasn't already happened."
3,"good, but missing some key info","This guide isn't bad but it is missing some key info.1. Left out some item location. a few item locations were left out. While they are not that important, that shouldnt happen at all.2. Did not provide repsond for each character. Through out the game you can email you party member to gain GP. The proper respond allows you to gain extra points.3. Did not cover enough on the very important Monsieur and Grandpa sidequest.Other than that the guide has everything you would need about this game."
4,good price good game love the anime series,first off let me just state that when my guide got to me it had a stain on the top cornor of the cover near the bind. also it had some folds on the cover this wouldn't have bothered me but i ordered like new and it wasn't.also as for the inside the pages were great they only had little wear not near what i though. im a long time gamer and so far this guide has been a big help mostly with the maps for the dugeons and boss fights as well a compete guide for weapons. overall i feel these pros far out way cons.this guide is well worth buying but i would have to say you should look around to make sure your getting it for a fare price that fits you.love this game guide as well as the series. hope this helps you all.
2,I agree with the review below...,"...although I don't hate the guide for it. Certainly, the game is quite easy to beat, and in fact, many of the more difficult items to obtain (such as the Grunties or the Ryu Books of 1000) could be found with trial and error. No, this guide falls short because of a tantalizing secret it dangles in front of its reader before pulling the bait away.According to the guide, there are hidden areas imbedded in .hack:liminality and .hack:sign (the anime DVD's which tie into the game). They give ONE of these areas (and proceed to claim the existence of many). I must confess, I can't find any more. For THAT, I knock the guide down three stars. Buy it if you want (I guess the illustrations are nice), but it is useless, really."
2,Why!!!??,"This game only takes about 20 hours to beat, and was so incredibely easy to find everything. Why would you need a guide to this game. I guess i recommend this guide to collectors who must always have everthing to do with what they are collecting. Because, if you put forth the smallest effort to solve problems on this game, you would have no problem beating it in two days. However nothing in offence to the game. It has an excellent story line, and an ending that will have you wanting more, which is good since the sequel comes out in 2 more months!!"
2,gh season 4,"the dvds are hard to watch, It's how the DVDS are set up. it would be better if it ran all of the shows without stopping. The first few seasons was set up like that but now it a pain in the balls. Have to stop and start after each show. In older DVD players, the menu does not work well. Have to watch on the PC to get all of the dvd to play."
4,Fits the car perfectly.,Very satisfied with this product. The only disappointment is that it doesn't overlap the step-in sill of the door entryway.
4,Good stuff,"i was waiting for this album to drop for the longest time and when it arrived i was not dissapointed but deep down i think prodigy has the talent to do a far superior album. he even said that he wrote it before murda music and on some tracks it shows, the lyrics on some tracks such as rock dat s~@T are not as strong metaphorically as say quiet storm on murda music.i was expecting more deep thoughts from P like the stuff he did on the illwill QB album, his power rap freestyle and Self conscience track was incredable on that CD and i expected the same kind of tracks. there are no real downers on the track as such apart from the beat on YBE and the fact that gun love was not on here. the most annoying thing about this album was the track what you rep because noreaga reined it with his stupid ad-libs making the track less serious to what it should have been. all in all this album is a good thugged out album with good beats, more production from havoc would have been nice though!"
4,Fundamental book!,"Well written book, easy to read. Full of bongo rhythms and variations. Ideal size and shape to put on a stand to practice.The downside: The stroke pictures are really bad, useless for beginners.If you're like me, beginner and want to learn alone, I suggest start watching some videos. and then buy this book. Video and book complement each other. But a book puts you at a higher level.Musical notation looks hard to understand, but the included CD makes it easier. Once you learn notation, your evolution becomes faster. Trust me!"
2,Disappointed,"I have owned my eclipse 3 system for 12 years. I purchased this part 2.5 years ago. It has now failed again. The flaw is in the design, as it is not water tight. They do not have a tight seal design. I normally would of recommended this product, now I am not so sure.I hope they come out with a retro fit to fix this problem, as I should of been able to get a longer life out of this product."
3,A little disappointed,"I usually LOVE Tina Wainscott books. However, IN TOO DEEP did not live up to the author's potential. I do have to say though that although not a mystery as many of her other novels are, this book had a villian that definitely gets under the reader's skin. It is a bit like her novel UNFORGIVABLE. Although the romance in ""IN TOO DEEP"" is a little weak. No clever twists and turns or surprise ending therefore, it falls short on my star rating. That does not mean that in itself it is not a decent novel for another reader, it is just not typical Tina Wainscott and avid fans might be left a bit disappointed.Is it worth buying?If you can get it on sale, perhaps. However, it would be wiser to check this one out from the library instead. If you really want to try a Tina Wainscott novel out, then check out NOW YOU SEE ME, OR I'LL BE WATCHING YOU."
3,WHEN YOU HOT..HELL YOU'RE HOT....BUT WHEN YOUR NOT....?,"I've held off reviewing this one cause cause I didn't really know how I felt about it....It's been a couple of months now and Ive just bought 9 and its not a patch on that or many of the others...Don't get me wrong, when its good its good eg. Torture, Crossroads, Sucking Your Blood..but the rest I just can't get into...I'll keep trying I guess...Anyway a quick plug for 9 which is BRILLIANT!"
2,Possibly the worst KD/MF album...,"I haven't heard them all, but this one isn't very good. The recording quality is great, the skill of the guitars and drums is pretty good, and King sings like (his) normal, but after listening to this several times I still can't remember any of the tunes. That compares to In the Shadows, Time, or Spiders Lullabye where I can hum several tunes in my sleep. Like one of the other reviews said, its kind of boring and doesn't really grab your attention. Some will like it if they are really into the style, but there are better albums."
1,DEAD AGAIN DOSENT DESERVE 5 STARS...NOT EVEN 2!,"""Dead Again"" certainly doesn't deserve 5 stars...not even 2! I really love Mercyful Fate's ""Don't Break The Oath"" (which was recorded almost 20 years ago). That's why I bought ""Dead Again"" and also ""9."" However, every Mercyful Fate album since ""Don't Break The Oath"" has been a bigger disappointment than the last. The guitar playing is ""average"" at best. The vocals are weak and lack power and intensity. The lyrics are a parady. I'd recommend ""Don't Break The Oath"" to a new metal fan but I'd tell them to skip anything after that."
4,Evilness Supreme!,"While King Diamond's vocals can get a little annoying once in a while, the riffing on this album is certainly evil and foreboding, and the music is as gripping as the claws of Death! A must for fans of metal!"
3,"""Your warm juices color my throught..........""","When ""Dead Again"" first came out, I was terribly disappointed. All the energy and musical coheasion was not there for me, and I was not at all impressed with Mike Wead taking over Michael Denner's spot. But, after a year of not listening to it, I have re-discovered that it really isn't that bad. Songs like ""Torture(1629)"", ""The Night"", ""The Lady Who Cries"" & ""Sucking Your Blood"" are really very good. The title track, like King sings, goes on and on and on. It does shine at spots, but lacks any real musical coheasion. And I do enjoy ""Banshee"" and ""Fear"". ""Mandrake"" has great some great riffs and themes but loses its direction in the middle and the end of the song. ""Since Forever"" is odd and melodic, and ""Crossroads"" would have been a lot better without the intrusive time changes. Nothing has really changed with this band, which is good, but ""Dead Again"" has to be the weakest Fate entry. It isn't bad, it's just not a ""gotta have""....."
4,cooper uses sincerity and sadness to power an amazing memoir,"we're in an age in which many memoir writers are fictionalizing their lives to suit their egos (I don't just mean frey). But in The Bill from My Father, Cooper investigates the very principles of ""evidence"" in meaningful ways. The tragedy of what frey has brought to the genre is that the principle he is held accountible to is ""truth""... when in fact the violation is really one of integrity, that he set out to deceive.You can tell when integrity is there and when it is not, in part through the characterization of self in a memoir.Cooper's integrity is the headline here, you can feel that it's not like it was just a hard set of events to deal with, but that it was hard to write about, hard to construct. All of it set against the 2-million dollar itemized bill, Cooper's intentions offset against his father's. It may sound crazy, but I recommend this to anyone who believes that intentions are what matter."
2,Descent at Best,"As a physics major, the class is a great one to take because of the excellent instructor I have. For most of the course, he has used Chapter 15 of Larson's Calculus. This book would be a good one to read and work through if you have the spare time but not really for a course. It could give better examples.Another problem with the book is that it is made with low quality. I have barely used this book for the entire semester, and pick it up today to see that some of the pages are falling out. I've taken care of this book, there should be no reason for it to be falling apart."
1,"Avoid this book if at all possible...if you can't, FIND A SUPPLEMENT!!","I had the unfortunate opportunity to have this book for my Multivariable course. The text was not at all helpful, explanations were not thorough. It states the theorems quite well, but fails to explain them in an applicable way. The examples that are shown are overly simplistic, but you do the review problems at the end of each section and have no idea how to begin. If you have to suffer through this book, find a supplement. Try Schaum's outline for Vector Calculus, or Calculus Early Trancendentals Volume 2."
4,Great Book on Vector Calculus,Historical introduction and historical notes is a plus on this book. Many applied examples and Illustrations makes it a good book for an introductory course on Vector Calculus. Optional section's with proofs are available at the book's website.
2,Not very profitable,"This wasn't what I would call a bad movie, but after we watched it, we felt like we maybe shouldn't have stayed up late to watch it... Didn't feel like a very profitable movie at all...."
1,Are you kidding me?,"Listen, kiddies, this here isn't heavy metal at all. It's Amy Grant masquerading as a metal band. Not only is this weak music, but it's basically rehashed bits of Sunday school jargon. If you want to listen to real metal I suggest you immediately search for Cannibal Corpse, Cryptopsy, Deicide, Soilent Green, Slayer, Malevolent Creation, Darkthrone, etc. You might just save your life or your mind. Living Sacrifice is a bunch of weak posers. Stay brutal and keep real metal alive."
2,Redemption,"Laurel has made a new life for herself in a small Texas town called Redemption. Once, she was a whore named Lil, but now is respectable, beloved, and even engaged to the town's mayer. Unfortunately, her past is about to catch up to her. The man she once loved, the Johnny Reb spy, Shenandoh, is also Brodie, her fiancee's brother. Brodie thinks his brother deserves better than a one time saloon girl, one he happens to still want. Is there any way at all for this triangle to resolve without heartbreak?Too much seems to be unsaid to make this a more than average book. Brodie's past almost seems incidental to the plot, when it feels like it should be more of a factor. Something is missing, and what would be an enjoyable story suffers for the lack.Amanda Killgore"
2,Same as the first,This is the exact same game as Vet Emergency 1. I don't know if maybe they added more cases at the end because I recently finished VE1 and I didn't want to basically replay it. I was really frustrated that nothing warns you that they are the same game for at least the first 30 or so cases. If you've already played VE1 I wouldn't recommend VE2 because you've basically played it but if you haven't I suppose this might work for you.
1,disappointed,"I just got this set and started watching it. The Undertaker is my second favorite wrestler of all time, next to Bruno Sammartino. I have so far watched 6 matches. I will agree they were really great matches, but Taker was the loser in 3 of the first 6 on the set. Now, maybe it's me, but when you do a tribute set to a performer, isn't it tradional to show matches he acually won? There are somewhere around 20 matches on here, and I didn't wait all these years to get a tribute set where Taker losses half the matches. It's the first tribute set i've seen where the honoree loses even one of the matches, let alone 3 of the first 6. Not my idea of a tribute. I'm very disappointed at the least."
3,Natural Horsemanship,"While this book contains plenty of useful and interesting facts concerningnatural horsemanship, for someone who's already into it, it can be somewhat tedious reading. Not something I couldn't put down until Iwas done. I'm going to think twice about purchasing the followup book.Jim L"
3,Definitely for the patience,"The ""pots"" you put everything in are all connected and all small. I considered using a teaspoon to put the soil in the containers but decide I could make just as much of a mess pinching the soil in my fingers. It has been a week or two and have seen nothing, but in cactus time a week is nothing. The instructions said to use the plastic container everything came in as a hot house but there was no way I was going to get it to fit in there. Since nothing seems to be happening, just for good measure I am going to put together a make shift hot-house to see if that helps. The first of the month is coming up and that is when I will water it. When dealing with cactus, you are usually in for the long haul."
4,A book worth reading.,"I found the book to be interesting, and worth the money. I don't know if I agree with everything I read, but I enjoyed it. It has a lot of stuff that makes you wounder, and ask questions. I liked it."
4,"Very informative of the ""What might Be""","It was informative in the fact it gave real answers to a mystrious subject. Some of it got to be a little out there, with the onset of future lives and the control of them."
5,Children's Book,"AS a director of a nursery school, I am always looking for wonderful books...""Snug As A Bug"" is just that!"
5,great service/price/delivery,"we needed a ruch delivery for our vacation of some quality water shoes with a decent price, we were treated superbly. our order took less than 3 full days to arrive. we will use amazon again to fine deals and service like this."
5,A Beautiful Album,"The recordings of ""Trumpet 101"" each move through a room like an elegant woman, smiling with you."
5,A sheer delight!,I bumped into this book in an airport in Minneapolis. My grandaughter did not budge from it for three days when I gave it to her. I am jealous I didn't think of it. It is a wonderful creative expression gift!
3,Good but a little disappointing.,"I was hoping for a little bit more than what I saw in the commercials. But I had to go to the added features to see my favorite hockey team, the New Jersey Devils. There, I only saw glimpses of SCOTT GOMEZ and PATRIK ELIAS. The bits on Lemieux and Gretzky<yawn>seen them before. But, on a fan level, this is a must for the Hockey library collection. My 3 stars on this DVD is for quality, 2nd for Dan Morriarty, and 1 star for the Super Skills Competion on the added feature list."
5,A GREAT TEACHING TEXT,"This is not a recent text, published first in 1982, but is one of the BEST on the topic. It explains accurately, with great case examples, the Brief Therapy model developed @ the Mental Research Institute. Am presently in process of developing a doctoral level course for clergy in counseling and will include this text."
1,American POWs in Korea - deserve better,"Spiller's American POWs in Korea:Sixteen Personal Accounts is poorly constructed. Photos of POWs in camps and of camps themselves, including the cover, are not of Americans but North Korean and Chinese POWs in UN camps. Dates, directions, and distances are often in error. Especially in error are the locations of POW camps holding Americans and the dates those camps existed. There were no recorded escapes from the permanent camps but one appears in this book. Too many obvious mistakes on a topic that should be treated with more respect."
1,Editing makes this set un-watchable,"I watched this with great anticipation, until I realized they were bleeping out words on the skits. I pawned it. Awful, and they took my money. I wouldn't have spent a nickle on this if I'd known it was cut up so badly. Worthless."
2,Dissappointing,"Bought this album with eager anticipation, particularly because of the cut with Michael Martin Murphey singing The Bard of Armagh/Streets of Laredo. Found the album to be neither Celtic nor Cowboy. Alas, it was Canadian. The overuse of the tinny mandolin was annoying. Did not want to listen to the album a second time. Perhaps MMM will do his own album in this vein and get it right."
3,better writing,"Although, I think kathy sanders is truly an impressive person, I do think that the writing was poor. At times it seemed very simple and corny. I especially think that the poems to introduce each chapter could have been so much more intersting. for example a quote from a thinker or philosopher that could have reflected the theme of the chapter.On the hand, I do think the book had some useful information and would recommend that people read it."
5,The Most enjoyable childrens music,"The Mother Goose Rocks series (especially 3 and 4) is great music for the whole family. Having 3 kids, ages 7yrs, 5yrs and 15 months we can all enjoy the familiar nursery rhymes while clapping our hands and dancing to the latest top 40 back ground music. The music all sounds like it is performed by the original popular artists. The big kids never complain that it sounds like baby music and they sing right along while teaching our youngest how to shake his little bootie. I highly recommend this cd if you occasionally get tired of the standard nursery rhymes performed the same way over and over."
2,This CD does not come with any liner notes or album notes.,"This CD does not come with any liner notes or album notes. It doesn't even have a CD serial number and year of issue! I purchased this CD as I needed both the music and the liner notes for my research assignment and I was so disappointed with the missing liner notes. I ended up buying another copy of the CD from amazon.uk which has the liner notes. You need to get the 2003 re-issue, serial number: 82876 55614 2, if you need the original liner notes by Stanley Dance and new liner notes by Stephanie Stein Crease. If you don't need the liner notes, you might as well just get the MP3 download. Do check out the album description of the same title at amazon.ca which indicates, ""Packaged in digipak format featuring original cover art & session photographs as well as original & newly commissioned liner notes. Bluebird. 2003."" That's the one to get."
3,"I loved the older version, this one is a bit too small for the crib.","I have several of these from my older daughter and they make chnging much easier. Unfortunatley, the newer versions seem shorter in length and barely stretch along the length of the crib. My daughter is 2 and a half, so this isn't a problem, but if she were very small, I would worry she could get caught."
2,"Leviton 1689-50 Pull Chain Switch, 3 Speed, 4 Position, 3A-250V AC, 6A","I tried to use this switch for a 3 speeds electric motor, It did not work for this application.The switch might be good but it works only for a very specific application."
5,A Must Read,"No self-respecting mystery fan can afford to pass this one up. Rochelle Krich's writing is so fluid she carries you easily through the book from first page to last. Molly Blume is a smart, funny, talented heroine, with character traits that we can all see in ourselves. Not since the days of Dell Shannon has there been an author whose characters come alive like Krich's, characters who make you feel you are part of their lives. You cheer for Molly as she pursues her investigations, relate to her family and wish for good things to happen to her personally. The book also tackles a difficult subject - postpartum depression - very sensitively and delicatley. If I had one complaint about this book it is that it ends far too soon to suit me. This is a book to read over and over again."
2,Blues in the Night,"This was my first venture into the world of Rochelle Krich, and I wasn't terribly impressed. While the main character Molly Blume was likable enough, the plot was somewhat simple and uninspired. All the Jewish trivia -- and there is a LOT of it -- was at first amusing, then boring, then downright irritating... While I'd read another installment in the Molly Blume series, it'd have to have been given to me rather than bought. Pure fluff."
4,Very Good Book,"The Giant's Toe is a tale with a moral, no matter how big you are, you can still be helped by someone that is much smaller. This story is about a giant who accidentally chops off his toe while hoeing in his cabbage garden. The toe ends up turning into a small boy when it's cut off, and the toe starts wreaking havoc. The giant is often annoyed with the toe, but the toe ends up helping him out in the end. I think that this is a very good book for people of all ages and can bring a smile to your face."
1,This product should be delisted!,"I received the first one in time for Xmas (for my son). It arrived broken. We ordered a replacement (which Amazon was terrific about, btw). Unfortuantely, the second one was also broken.Amazon needs to delist this product from its inventory. Clearly there are several defective."
1,some reviews are likely shill reviews,"this book is written by someone who operates a constantly advertised website in the trading magazines like TASC. He gives absolutely no feedback when you answer specific questions, makes wildly profitable claims without any audits or proof, charges a fortune for the service. And the few reviews on the web are pretty much bad."
1,Disappointing at best,"I didn't listen to all the reviews I read regarding this toy. I just had to buy it and now I am living with the remorse and disappointment. My child is bored to death and it's unstable. First the 'see me' mirror is that plastic stuff that distorts so you really can't 'see' anything but a blur. Second the 'key' can be turned by a baby but it won't get the sounds and lights to work, as it requires nearly sub-human strength by an adult, not to mention coordination. Third if your baby likes to 'move and groove' there's no back support so they can flip right out the back. It's cute, but a complete waste of money."
3,Not quite large enough,"Nice case, but does not have sufficient room for the owners manual, spare batteries, and lens filters, particularly with the camera strap attached.Other than space, it is a good case."
3,Too Much Balonay,"It Stinked. well it was alrgiht, Jim Mars & stanton Freedman are always entertaining and there was some good information but not as detailed as other sources and this video just went on too long about politics instead of concentrating on more stories about UFO's. As the other review stated, the video lost focus and just becamse random bits of stories, plus the german narrator could barely speak english so that didnt make much sense. But I need to watch again to give it a completely fair review."
3,Very Informative,Very informative but no new information really.This documentary keeps one wondering about our place in the universe.Would be nice to see an update to this documentary
4,Congratulations,I must confess to being shocked to discover that Ultraman series had a lot more entertaining adventures than I thought. I recomment this product to all lovers of Ultraman.
4,e,"Enjoyable, funny, cuts close - with an unexpected ending that makes you think.Amazon, forcing me to use a certain amount of words, will make that I will not rate books any longer."
2,Hot to cold,"Starting with rip-roaring giggles from the short stories told by Martha Boulton, to a low dull in the last pages that are little more that statement of her opinion. The book leaves you with an unfinished feeling that there is more she could have written about. Guess that is why she has several books before and after this one. A good book to relax with just before bed."
1,Deny All Knowledge: read review,"The book ""Deny all Knowledge"" is one my mom bought me for Christmas, I am 14 years old and one of the biggest X-Files fans on the face of the earth. I found this book VERY hard to understand, yet, I finished it. The words are hard to make out and I don't recommend it to anyone under 16 yrs of age."
2,Monongahela National Forest Hiking Guide,The book was older and in good shape. I spent $30 but inside the front was written $5 like it was purchased at a discount store or flea market - the bood is exactly what I was looking for and it was vintage but I still felt ripped off.
3,It's a nice book.,My class required this book and I got it with cheaper price here than in my school bookstore. It worked fine I guess.
5,This sweater vest really accents my better features!,"While this sweater vest is labeled a ""mans"" sweater vest, I try not to live my life based on other peoples ""labels"". Let me tell you I LOVE LOVE LOVE this sweater vest. In fact I love this sweater vest so much I wear it daily. How can you go wrong with a blue sweater vest? Goes with everything including my dude loafers. When you walk into a room wearing this sweater vest you exude confidence, it is like a breath of fresh air and sunshine just entered the building. If you live an active life style such as I do, constantly on the move, this sweater vest is for you."
2,prepare yourself,"on the real, this is a gr8t show, you will long for more of the show than what is offered. My gripe is, this product is over charged. there are 3 DVDs but only 2 of them have the tv show on them; its a trick. The same goes for the 2nd season which never ends completely."
4,Wonderfully compelling,"If you haven't seen Noah's Arc, and you like gay-themed movies and shows, then do not waste any more time before investing a little time on Noah's Arc.It's funny, topical, poignant, compelling, smart, and downright addictive. I can't wait for the second season.Noah and his three friends share joys and losses with their relationships and each other while being refreshingly unafraid to be themselves. That they are all Black is interesting, but they could be Purple and their experiences would be universally pertinent to other gay men.Check it out. Enjoy."
3,Read it together with David Irving's biography,"This book is very much an analysis of the malignant effects of putting Göring in charge of the Four Year Economic Plan, the wastage and inefficiency resulting from his mis and non management of the economy. To get a better feel of Göring as a person, vile, vainglorious, vulgar, you should also read Irving's book."
2,Is John Leguizamo great in everything?,"""The Babysitters"" drowns in its own implausibility from the first moment. There's no reason clean-cut high school girls would suddenly start a prostitution ring. There's no reason that all the dads in town would patronize them instead of adult escorts. Once things in this movie get going, there's no reason anybody would behave anything like they do, including John Leguizamo's character, a middle-aged mensch trapped in a sexless marriage (to a shrewish Cynthia Nixon, channeling Miranda) who sets it all in motion. His character is a checklist of mid-life crisis clichés, but whenever Leguizamo is on the screen he projects a sweet soulfulness that makes you believe in and care for the guy. His uncharacteristically low-key performance hits every stupid note just right. He's like a figure skater performing a brilliant routine with lead weights strapped to his legs. There's absolutely no other reason to watch this movie."
3,Not bad,"I was suggest this movie threw Amazon. I never saw it before. It wasn't a bad movie, I just didn't like a few things on the movie. I don't think Cynthia Nixon and John Lequizamo make a good couple. They just don't look right together. I also didn't think John looks like a guy who has sex with teenagers. He might or might not do that in real life, but in this movie it didn't seem like it is him. Besides those two things I enjoyed this movie."
3,Nicely Done,"I was surprised to see Cindy Nixon in this movie. It was a pretty good story line and acting was done ok.I would recommmend as it's a ""R"" rated movie, not X."
3,The girls enter into some risky business,"It's an obvious comparison to the well known movie with Tom Cruise, of course. Girls in high school find out that babysitting can lead to trysts wtih the daddies, who will pay them lots of money for the privilege. Things are going smoothly until one girl starts to pick up business on the side, threatening the founder of the group.Good performances from Waterston and Leguizamo in particular."
1,Not impressed - looked exactly like the stock bulbs (yellow),"Not at all impressed with these lights. In terms of color temperature, they looked exactly like my stock (yellowish) bulbs. I could have bought stock bulbs for $5 each.Don't bother."
2,They don't last long.,"I bought two 3-packs of these socks for work. I work 4 days a week. That means, at most, I wore a pair once a week. They felt great at first.They began wearing thin on the bottom of the heel after approximately 6-8 months... On EVERY pair! The quality just isn't there. 5.11 makes some things well, these socks are not one of them. If they can't last a maximum of being worn 52 times, don't waste your money.Poor quality. I would never recommend these socks to anyone."
1,Not dishwasher safe,Had the mug less than a week. The flimsy little spill proofing insert broke in the dishwasher. The mug is now being used for office coffee. I need a new travel mug.
5,better than expected and just what I need,better than expected and just what I need... I was thinking of something like that and I get it! thanks
4,I'm unhappy but happy.,"Well, I had the Hitachi 4 GB Microdrive for about 2-years and it worked flawless with my former Sony DSC-F828. I recently purchased the much touted Canon EOS 30D and had success with the drive, however, after maybe 100 shots the card went kaput citing an error. This is my personal experience and the card was a bit aged."
3,Worked well... for a while,"I've used this card for approximately 5 years with my Canon Digital Rebel XT. For all five of those years, I had no complaints. It worked well, and it held a ton of pictures. All of a sudden however, it stopped in the middle of a transfer onto my computer. I pulled the card out of the reader and went to put it in my camera, and my camera won't read it either, and now I can't get any data off if it all - it claims I need to format it to use the card.So in summary - good card, no complaints, but questionable long term reliability."
2,Not for the very young,"We bought this game as a family game since my four year old can't play many of our games. After reading every subtitle I barely felt like playing. It seemed like a chore. So if your child cannot read, plan on talking the entire time. The plot was definately not for the young at heart. It's based on a dog whose younger sibling is dying and needs a doctor from dog island. My daughter felt horrible when her ""little brother"" passed out in the game and was told there was nothing anyone could do to help except travel to this island where their dad has already gone missing trying to find the cure. I now wish I would have spent the extra money and bought the littlest pet shop game."
2,"Kids need to be able to read, and parts are quite scary","You'd think ""cute puppies"" and you'd think a game for little kids, right? You'd be wrong. First, be prepared to sit there and read pages and pages and pages of stuff to your young child - every screen is packed with reading. Second, many of the themes are a bit scary. For instance, you have to go to Dog Island to find a way to save a sibling from DYING of a disease. great. Then there are nasty things like snakes (oh great, thanks for working my child's phobia there folks) hiding around.Mainly my 6 year old son just got bored. It didn't *do* enough for him."
3,can't find the expire date&#65281;&#65281;&#65281;,no date&#65292; no date&#65292;no date&#65292;no dateit's kids gummy&#65292; why can't find the expire date&#65281;what else can I say&#12290;&#12290;&#12290;&#12290;why&#65311;
5,T&K Chem series is cumulative,"I am going to buy some of these kits, but the Amazon site does not explain the sequencing. At the Thames and Kosmos site, they explain that Chem 2000 contains all of the experiments of Chem 1000 and then some. Likewise, Chem 3000 contains all of the experiments of Chem 1000 and 2000 and then some. I figured there might be other parents out there who wanted this piece of information."
2,Way too complicated!,I found this kit way too intimidating. I realize I am not a science buff but there was just too many guidelines and instructions for the ages that it was rated for. I believe it is best for ages 15 and up.
3,kit is ok,its a very good kit but if it came with all the stuff you needed it would be better the first experiment calls for something that is not included but overall the kit is very good value
5,Worth the wait for 360,"I almost got the PC version of this months ago but decided to check forums first. I read that there would be more levels in the 360 version, so I decided to wait. After anticipating this game for a long time, I can happily report that it really hits the ball out of the park. Great action and a fun diversion from the style of the other Heroes games."
3,Not the best and not the worst,I just got finished with this game today with all the endings (which all are mediocre by the way). This isn't the worst RPG game out there but it certainly isn't the best either. The dialogue most of the time is cheesy and there's no real character development. After I best the game I felt pretty disapointed because it should've been more to it. This game is worth playing if you want to kill a little time and if you find it cheap ($20 or less).
1,Might be the worst book I ever read,"I loved the book (and movie) Rosemary's Baby, and was so looking forward to Son of Rosemary when it first came out. Once starting the book, however, I couldn't quite believe how badly written it was. The plot was silly and made little sense, the dialogue was cliched and dull.I kept reading because I kept hoping it would get better. Plus there was a silly mystery involving the phrase ""roast mules"" that I was curious as to what the answer was.But the ending was so bad, so awful, so insulting to the original book, I was actually angry. This likely is the worst book I've ever actually finished reading. And they didn't even answer the ""roast mules"" mystery!! I had to look up the answer online."
2,Second parts .......,"I was waiting more from this book. I did not like it at all. I prefer the first book, second parts never are good"
4,Great live album,"This is a pretty good album from the group mainly known for their live performances. Almost all the tracks are worth listening to. It displays what real hip-hop sounded like back in those days and puts to shame almost any released rap record from the same period. The rhyming ranges from the sing-songy to the more rhythmic, onbeat style we know today. The music consists of strong break beats which is a world apart from the overrated Sugar Hill sound that was so predominant. The sound quality is not the best but acceptable, and better than other similar albums. This is an album that can stand on it's own but is as interesting for it's historical value. Released by Charlie Chase himself on his own label!"
5,Higher coward.,"Immolation is one of my favorite deathmetal bands out there. Im wearing their t-shirt as we speak---just showing my support for this amazing band. Over-all, pretty amazing album with great production and intense vocals all together."
2,Of limited usefulness,"This device produces almost no low-frequency sound, and as a result is not effective at blocking many common sources of noise, such as airplane and automobile traffic, your neighbor's stereo, and the like; it's all treble, no bass. It might be useful for blocking conversation or tv noise."
1,Clicks,"I have owned many marsona white noise machines. This one is on their higher end, but it makes a clicking noise every so often, annoying, i keep waiting for the next click, couldn't sleep with it, but husband is able to."
1,Disappointed...,"This was a four star product... until it broke after one week of use. I'm a carpenter and wear banded hearing protection every day for the convenience factor. I liked that the gel material the plugs were made of could be easily cleaned, unlike yellow foam which gets nasty in a hurry. If these lasted a month or two I might of considered buying them again, but a week is unacceptable."
1,Short life ... lasted one month.,"Installed on December 28th 2011, one failed January 30th 2012. I've had less expensive 100W H7s that lasted longer. I will not use white/blue bulbs since regular bulb seem to work better for my eyes. I have a 170 mile commute in primarily rural darkness and require good performing forward lighting."
4,Memorable & Engaging,"I am very visual,I purchased this bible to help me remember events in the bible and it has.The pictures are realistic, they are actually what you would think of for the time period.I am reading it(along with an NIV bible), with my teenage son and I find him quoting bible verses because the graphic book made the bible real to him. I enjoy it, I've read it twice, only wish it were longer."
5,My Wife's Fave,I bought this for my wife three years ago and she loves it. I have also tried it since we are in a harsh winter climate here in the Midwestern US. I have to admit it's a great moisturizer. She likes it because it's not greasy and absorbs quickly. I like it because it's not fragranced and goes on cleanly after I shave.
2,Bach's piece,"Thanks to you all, you've really helped me, I was searching everywhere, but I'm still wishing to find what Lesley Composed and done, with that lovely piece in the movie.If I'll find one (cd), I'll be more than happy to share it with you all."
2,Missing Cello,"After watching the movie on cable last night and realizing that none of the cello pieces were included on the disc I was disappointed. I originally heard one of the pieces (Bach Suite#1 in G. Prelude). In the movie ""JAZZ ON A SUMMERS DAY"" from 1959. Which is now on DVD, If you any kind of jazz or classical fan you want this DVD in your collection......Jazz I mean."
1,too small for my yorkie,"I got this as an add on item with a few other toys. I saw the ""extra small"" and thought it would be perfect for my Yorkie because she is still small and her other toys are bigger than she is. It shipped fast and when I got it I saw that it came with and extra squeeker but the toy is tiny. It surprises me that they could even fit the squeeker inside of the toy! Very cute so I am ordering another but a size up...maybe 2."
2,Not that tough,"15 minutes and the arm was off...why they put the fuzzy hair on the top I will never know..that was about 2 minutes...squeaker was out in 17 minutes and in the trash..there is stuffing (polyester) in this toy, so in the trash............"
2,Super Extra Small Duckie,The duck was ok one of the eyes is significantly smaller than the other.Also and the most important thing is that it is smaller than expected! Im afraid that my dog will eat it.
3,Not worth the price,"The toy is very small, and the squeak died almost immediately. I bought it because I liked the idea of replacing the squeek. BUT, replacing the squeak was VERY difficult. All in all, I am very disappointed in it and wouldn't recommend it or the other toys like this to others. I bought a couple of these Kong toys with the same result. The dog likes them, but no more than any other squeak toy."
1,horrible toy,"When i ordered this duck I expected a stuffed animal, not a incredibly tiny piece of junk. I wouldn't of even bought this if I knew what it really looked like. Save your money and get a real dog toy!"
1,GIVE ME A BREAK!!!,"I have to admit that Woodward and Berstein's ""All the Presidents Men"" and this book are both fascinating reading, very well done and interesting, (but from men with their experience what else would you exopect?). But having done considerable research on the Watergate episode I have to call ""Foul"" on this book. It's supposed to be a history of the final days of Nixon's presidency but from all the misquotes and outright lies put forth here it is more like another hatchet job on Nixon. Like I said, it's an interesting book, just don't take it to literally."
2,Fairy Tales,"When one checks this narrative against more careful, less partisan works, one finds much of it to be speculation and hearsay. One of the most damaging myths the authors put forth is that Nixon was a heavy drinker. In fact Nixon was fairly abstemious. His constitution was such that even just one drink would cause him to seem intoxicated--if he was tired. Much of the book should be treated as a fairy tale.Rose Woods could not have been Deep Throat; she was extremely loyal and in fact had little or no access to Nixon's desk. Haldeman had her office set up well away from either of Nixon's offices--in the basement someplace. I also rather doubt that the Enemies List was anything Nixon had anything to do with personally. His staff was renowned for its bunker mentality and spin tactics. Perhaps it lay on Colson's desk."
1,WarTech Senko No Ronde,"Not a very good game, a waste of money. THE LANGUAGE IS IN JAPANESE, THE GRAPHICS ARE VERY BAD AND THE CONTROLS ARE VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Look elsewhere,"Stick to ""Strength, Conditioning, and Injury Prevention for Hockey"" by Joseph Horrigan. Far better information that's hockey specific and is laid out in an easy-to-follow format."
3,What happened to Juan Gabriel?,"If this is the ""new"" Juan Gabriel, I want the old one back! With songs like ""Influenciado Por La Luna (Luna Llena)"" and ""No Apaguen La Luz,"" I have to wonder if somebody's smog is getting to him. Strange, indeed. The reality and feeling rendered in songs like ""947 Fiske St"" give hope that we haven't totally lost Mexico's legendary singer/songwriter. That said, most of the arrangements are pretty good, and Juan's voice is as beautiful as ever. Todo Está Bien is a worthwhile listen; it's just not top-shelf material when applied to the standards Juan has been setting for nearly 30 years and to which many other singers seem to strive to match. Can't blame him for trying something new. But PLEEEZE, Juan, don't abandon the good ol' stuff."
1,No Esta Bein,Iv been a spanish music fan since I was 2 year's old. And I have to say this is the worst piece of junk Juan Gabriel could ever do. All I have to say is Esta Disco NO ESTA BEIN!
1,false representation of product,"Warning: This is not Diesel Green Special Edition, as is indicated by the photo! This is Diesel Green. There is a HUGE difference in product, as the two do not remotely resemble one another. This photo needs to be changed in order to indicate the product being sold."
3,Not a great value,"Certainly couldn't give this as a gift - the one I got had leaked a bit. Not the end of the world but the packaging was dirty and the cologne melted the silver finish on the pump, making it smear off. To confirm another review on here, this isn't the special edition as pictured, it's the regular.As for the cologne itself, it's mild, a little citrus-y, a little vanilla, a touch floral and very generic. A bit of a let down as Diesel's other colognes are unique, bold and delicious. Still giving it 3 stars because it's not in any way a bad scent, just nothing amazing going on here."
3,Nw Music,"Purchased this as an ""exploration"" of new music. Not really something I would listen to frequently. It's okay. The product arrived quickly."
4,Good product and worth ordering,"I searched the internet extensively before ordering these training chopsticks for my 8-1/2 years old daughter. I hesitated ordering any made out of plastic, as they all seem to share the same problem: the ones made from plastic appear to be unable to firmly grasp small or heavy pieces of food. As soon they arrived, I checked out the functioning-aspects of the chopsticks myself before giving them to my daughter to use, and she loves them. Intelligently designed,the chopsticks are made from two individual pieces glued at the top, sit well in the hand, and the tips have small grooves in them, making it easier to grasp food so that it doesn't slip out. Of course, being made of lacquered wooden, they need to be washed by hand. I would definitely recommend these chopsticks to anyone looking for a good pair of beginner's chopsticks."
3,An OK book.,"I like Swindoll, but he rates 3 stars compared to Tozer. If you want to read a great book on God I suggest about anything by A.W. Tozer. The Attributes of God (2 books) are very good and IMHO much more enlightening."
3,Enjoyable,Claudia was headed off to college and decided she needed to find herself while away. She figured if she has a boyfriend that she has been with for over 4 yrs she won't be able to figure out what she wants and who he is. You really had the idea of what Claudia's character was like. You also could easily fall in love with Gabe. The idea of the plot was great but the execution of it not so much. I really felt the ending lacked. I didn't quite know how it ended like it did. The ex-boyfriend you really felt for. I never felt there was a reason why they should have broken up. So I will take the good with the bad. 30 Guys in 30 days was a light and fun read. I recommend this for car reads & office wait reads. I liked that the book was small enough to stuff in my purse. It's quick and easy read.
5,A childhood favorite,"I bought this to remind myself of summers spent with my grandparents. I still listen to it on occasion, really does aid in sleeping!"
4,Excellent and Cheap,"This simple folding stove is very good for the money. I didn't give it five stars because it is heavy (which makes it a burden for trail backpacking). The heaviness should however, make it more sturdy. Mine was loose so, I had to bend one of the holding tabs to make it tight. It took me five seconds, and now the pot stand is very ridged. I bought this folding stove(pot stand) to supplement my homemade soda can alcohol stoves. I wish it was made in the USA, however, almost nothing is made in the USA anymore, so I would rather buy something made in free Taiwan, than communist China.If you want to see what I did to tighten this little folding pot stand, please click the link below, where I have pictures of the five seconds it took to make the stove completely ridged.Folding pot stand pics are at the very bottom..[...]Mark :)"
5,Great little stove,"I love this little thing. It folds up flat, relatively lightweight, and for only 8 bucks I couldn't have asked for more. I have NOT had any issues that others have mentioned regarding the integrity of the hinges or it staying intact in use. I would recommend."
5,Great Little Stove,"Excellent little stove for emergency use with Sterno fuel cans. Sturdy construction, good finish, better than most other tin-box stoves offered by various camping gear manufactures."
1,Very Poor Quality,"This kit is very expensive considering the extremely poor quality of the wood. The wood is just some rock-bottom-of-the-barrel plywood. No matter how carefully we tried to punch out the pieces, they often broke and splintered on the edges. Our efforts were not aided in the fact that some pieces were not well cut in the first place. I would like to second another reviewer that said the directions were confusing. More diagrams would have been helpful. Long story short, I will never buy another Greenleaf house."
5,LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT,"Luxor is a fabulous game, addictive, and on a couple of levels very difficult. My other half is a true gamer and loved it too, and found it to be quite challenging. There are some very challenging levels--the Khufu levels--but once you get past them, you're able to do it again. You will love this game. The colors and graphics are very nice eye-candy. You'll wake up in the middle of the night thinking ""twenty more minutes...just another twenty minutes and I'll have it licked."" Have fun!!"
3,addictive but too hard,"This game starts out to be a lot of fun and very addictive, but as you get to the higher levels (7 - 9 plus) it gets WAY too hard and therefore just frustrating and not fun. I wish there was a way to slow down the harder levels so that I can get further along in the game. It seems unfair to make it so hard and not let buyers of the game get through the whole thing."
4,Quality product for years of service.,My son works at a shipyard and in the winter it can get very cold. I wanted something to keep him warm and this was just the ticket.
5,St Louis Cardinals DVD,"A great gift for a St Louis fan, arrived without any problems! My nephew is a huge fan, and was so excited when he opened this on Christmas!"
3,Glad I have it....but,"I am a lifelong Cardinals fan and this season offered perhaps my favorite all-time ""rooting"" experience. I am therefore happy to have this DVD. It brought back a good deal of that joyful feeling I experienced throughout the playoffs. But I cannot help but say that it could have been so much better. It is just an ""okay"" effort. Game 6 of the World Series is perhaps the best example. The lead up to the game tying hits in the 9th and 10th innings was insufficient. The drama was not built, and boy was there drama. That is true of much else as well: wasted opportunities. But the story is such a good one, so compelling and emotional, that even this modest effort is worth the cost.Also as others have said - it is difficult to explain the choice of game 5 of the Phillies series over Game 6 of the World Series if you can only include one full game."
5,I got some brownie points with this one!,I got this for my husband who can't live without his Cardinals. As soon as he got it he raced to the television to watch it. He really enjoys it!
4,A very competent biography,"Mr. Burgess knows his Shakespeare and shares his wealth of knowledge in a very fascinating way. Almost every aspect of the Bard's life is analyzed and it creates a very entertaining story.Not much is known about William Shakespeare himself. This often forces Burgess to make educated conjectures as to what the truth may have been. When Burgess puts forth his opinion he supports it with so much fact that you almost feel that if it wasn't the way Burgess said it was, it should have been.All-in-all, if you are a Shakespeare man and want to know what inspired and influenced him, this book is for you. Burgess knows Shakespeare like no other person."
2,Good entertainment....,"Not as good as Hitchcock's but acceptable; great performances, nice sceneries and costumes; if you love the intrigue and suspense ""English style"", you will enjoy it."
5,REBORN,Good book. Excellant condition. F. Paul Wilson is one of my favorite authors and buying on Amazon is the best thing for everything ships out within a few days of purchase.
4,Good supernatural suspense reading,"Mr. Wilson is my favorite thriller/suspense writer, although I prefer his medical thrillers more. I've only read one other book from his Adversary Cycle, THE TOMB, so I don't have the same comparisons to make as the other reviewer here. However, I really enjoyed this book even though it was in a different genre. I got the hardcover edition from the library -- the illustrations were unbelievable! Mr. Gervais portrayed the moments with such detail and precision. If you are a fan of Mr. Wilson's works, I would not give up on this one. It's still a good read, a la ""Rosemary's Baby""."
4,This was a good documentary,"There are a lot of good history re-enactors scenes as well as commentary. You got a sense that you was in the actual battle. However, these re-enactments are re-played often throughout the film and after awhile you think you're looking at the same scene over again. I found the map commentary to be very good, although I would have liked to have seen more of it. I still recommend this DVD for the history buffs out there and for those who enjoy re-enactments."
3,Excellent background music,"This disk is a very repetitive mixure of techno musical textures, coupled with samples of McCartneys music past and present (well up to the time it was released.) It is very interesting, and certainly not everyone's cup of tea.I give it three stars, because compared to other musich, it is no better than middle of the road, but for what it is, I really like it. Confused? You should be. I have had this disc since it came out, and I listen to it 5 to 10 days a year, generally at night when heading off to slumberland, working, reading, or when playing a game. It is the kind of music that is not so good to sit and listen to, but as a kind of hypnotic background, I really dig it :)"
5,Waited a long time for this,"I have really enjoyed this album. You can really tell the Russ put his heart into the entire album. My favorite songs are ""Back into Grace"", ""Right Here, Right Now"" and ""Lazarus"" If you have liked any of Russ Taff's work in the past you would really like this one."
5,Adult Swim's best,"Overall, worth the money if you haven't seen Adult Swim in a while. These are all just the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd year episodes. This set is a mix. My only complaint is I wish that they were all just the same season."
3,I would have bought this,if everything was season 1.what the hell is up with the random seasons for each show???
2,Lasted for 12 months,My F5U237 V3 worked very well and had a functional and aesthetically pleasing design. About a year after I purchased the hub Windows started giving me the unknown USB device found routine. Because of the life span I can only give it 2 stars for design. I would not recommend this product.
5,Easy setup,The Belkin USB 2.0 hub was very easy to setup. The top mounted jacks allow very easy access for memory sticks or camera connections.
3,"Works great, feels cheap","Product works great and provides easy access to ports. This is my 2nd hub of this design... The only issue is cosmetic - the hub is feels really cheaply made and has no weight, so it slides all over the place."
2,Disappointing...,"The concept is great! However, when you try to use the car it doesn't like to work at slow speeds, and at medium the handles whip the elves into a frenzy and they get lodged between the handle and the side with the Polar Express logo.We're going to go to a train shop to see if we just got a bad car, or if it's a design flaw. For the price I was very disappointed."
3,3 1/2 stars,"Though it's an easy way out of writing a critigue, I pretty much have to mirror everything PW has to say about this book. I know if F. Paul Wilson alone would have written this novel it would no doubt have been much better. Not an incredibly solid read with a less than fulfilling ending. The whole concept of the story was good but the 'putting together' was not."
3,Disappointing,"Picked up this book the other day. The story description looked interesting, and I noticed that one of my favorite writers, F. Paul Wilson, was one of the authors. I have to say that I was disappointed in this book. The ""good guy"" characters weren't particularly likeable, which is crucial to a good story. They were bland and kind of boring. The ending was unfulfilling. After forcing myself to read the entire book, hoping it would get a little better, I felt let down and cheated. Seems like the authors took the easy way out and left things unexplained. Wouldn't recommend this book."
1,Sharp Edge Will Cut,"In the review titled ""Not Practical"", shopper said sharp edge is hard to grasp. Well, I cut my finger on the sharp edge of this wok when I was loading it into the dishwasher. I am none too pleased! Never happened w/any of my other AC pans. I'm giving just one star & would not recommend anyone buy this particular wok."
3,A good referesher book,"I think this book is beyond a simple introduction. First half of the book is Vector Analysis and other half is mixture of transformations and Tensor analysis. It covers a lot and has examples for each concept. What I did not like was that the concepts were introduced from general to particular. So if you are not exposed to Vector or Tensor analysis, it is not easy to follow a new concept defined on n-dimensional space and see application on two dimensional space.So it was a good refresher with some applications to Physics but for new starter it is difficult especially for self lerner. Also definitions were very abstract, dry without any meaning attached to it. I can not considered this book as a course book by itself."
3,Not bad,I'm not really a fan of this style of music. But I heard a couple of songs from this cd and thought they were pretty good. I'd say for my taste... I only like 4 or 5 songs. But I'm sure other people more tuned into this style would enjoy it more.
5,Great vinyl edition of a GREAT album,"The vinyl edition of Kala is MILES ahead of the digital counterpart. If you have a record player and love this album, the vinyl edition is a no brainer."
1,The ... of Eckankar Revealed,"This book will probably not be offered in the future unless it goes through a drastic rewrite. This is a 1970 copyright when Twitchell was still fine tuning his new creation... Eckankar. On pages 16-19 (Fourth Printing, 1974) Twitchell places the Mental Region (Plane) before the Causal! Actually, it seems Twitchell had yet not named this other region as the Causal as yet. He gives it the name of Daswan Dwar. The colors Twitchell associates with these planes are off as well. He corrects this in later works. It's amazing the amount of confusion that Twitchell creates, and is clear that the current leader (Klemp) is having to do an intensive cover-up of the lies of Twitchell. Unfortunately, this means that this book and other evidence will soon become unavailable."
5,Birthday Gift,I brought this for my brother for his birthday and he love it he though I brought it from Wal-Mart.
2,"Discs Were Missing, Not as Advertised","Received the package quickly, but two of the discs in the set were missing. Sort of frustrating to buy a set like this and have stuff missing."
5,Una serie espectacular.....,Una temporada para recordar la buena actuación de estos personajes.Debo recordarles que soy fiel admirador de esta serie y me compre toda la serie completa.
3,"this is a good book,but does have christian overtones","For adopted children and for parents to read to their adopted young children,this is a good begining book,but if you are not christian or perfer not to be quite so dogmatic,this might not be the book for you."
1,Good idea suffering from terrible industrial design,"The four and five pin adapters are protected by two dust covers. These dust covers attach to the ground pin via an interference fit. Problem is, the pull tab for the dust cover is located opposite of the ground pin, so when you try to pull off the dust cover you bend the ground pin ninety degrees (see ""customer images"" for a picture of what I'm describing. The first time I tried to uncover the four pin connector the ground pin snapped off and stuck in the rubber dust cover.If you order this product, I suggest you immediately cut the lanyard that holds the dust covers, and be sure to pull the dust covers straight off while holding both sides -- if you use the pull tab alone you could pry off the ground pin as I did. This problem could be easily addressed by putting the pull tab on the same side as the ground pin."
5,Easy to Use,"Very ease to use, plug in to your 7 pin RV blade on the truck and its ready to go. Nice to have both 4 pin and 5 pin. Better price than I found at my local stores, even after factoring in shipping cost."
3,Product solves common problem for towers,"I use the Hopkins 47385 Multi-Tow Adapter on a 2010 Chevy Tahoe. The 4-pin and 5-pin connections make the product very versatile for different types of commonly wired trailers. Not sure why the dust covers for the 4-pin and 5-pin connections aren't shown in the picture, but they come with the product and stay attached to the tow adapter. You do need to pull the dust covers straight off the pins to avoid damaging the ground pin. Be sure and read the review by Corn-Picker dated 01-13-12 to get further information on the product design flaw.I leave the tow adapter plugged into the vehicle at all times."
3,Metal pin is easily bent,The metal pin is bent if you use the pull tab on the cover. You need to be careful when removing the cover.Other people have reported this same problem.
1,Aptly named at least,"I have to listen to this trash at work every single day and I am about ready to hand in my two weeks. You only need to listen to ""Always After You"" to get a sense of exactly what's wrong with this entire album. Hamilton Leithauser sounds like a palsied halfwit wailing and banging on a toy drum. I mean the man is too lazy to open his mouth to sing. That's actually hit it pretty well on the head - it's lazy. Lazy lazy lazy from start to finish. One long droning ""Duuuuuuuuuuuuh."" Thank you, Walkmen, for actually making my day harder to get through."
1,undelivered item:,"Dear Amazon,I have not received this book yet, please advice me accordingly. Purchased on 09/23/2011Best regards,Paul Chia"
4,"Da, Da, Da","A brilliant film based on the complex and enigmatic character of Andreotti, and Italy itself. The Italian political scene during the Christian Democrats' reign was rife with clientelism, corruption and terrorism. Servillo's portrait of Andreotti is appropriately ambiguous and opaque. The primary strength of this film is Sorrentino's masterful direction, settings, framing, film composition and montage. Plus, any film that can successfully incorporate Trio's 'da da da' into a soundtrack predominately composed of classical music deserves commendation. Bravo!!!"
5,As a College Textbook,"I'm a Hamilton College student pursuing an Asian Studies major. This book is a pretty good summary of Japanese history covering cultural, religious, and historical information. It also is in color unlike the privious addition, or so says my professor. Overall it makes a pretty good college textbook."
4,Fast,Ordered it in December and got it at the end of December. Good price! Ready for class to start. Whoo Hoo!
3,It was funny.,It's not a riot but there are some really funny scenes. Probably the funniest scene involves one of the Smothers brothers confusing airline penuts with something else.
4,"Incredible, Incredible, Incredible!!!!!","I love this series. I saw it on Tech tv once and instantly bought it through this site. Granted the first volume is the worst, but still great. I usually hate most animes. But this one was awesome! Almost everyone i have shown this dvd to has not told me otherwise. If you buy this dvd, i highly recomend watching it with subtitles in japanese. This is where this dvd only got 4 stars. The American voice acting is suprisingly worse than usual. And the original japanese script is much less corny. The visuals are great too. most of the action sequences involve gorgeous computer generated visulas that blend almost perfectly with the actual animation. This anime is also actually funy! Yes, I said funny! It isnt constant hilarity, but you will laugh at least once or thrice. This dvd is gorgeous, funny, suspenseful, and it only gets better as the series continues. Buy now!"
3,Disappointing,"I may have missed the boat on this one but I have a problem getting into Maggie's true personality... Wash was such a charming fellow, yet she gave her heart and soul totally to Reece who everyone said was a scoundrel from start to finish...I don't think Maggie was true to herself whatsoever. She adored her third child yet I think she ignored her first two. Poor Tate. How could he have put up[ with all her ongoing trash?? I guess she was really mentally ill from the get go. AS a Tar Heel, born and bred, I loved the North Carolina scenes but let there not be a sequel of Maggie. I just do not care whether she came back or not."
1,It's easier to throw it away than find out what return shipping costs.,"In an over simplified manner, this book should not have the word survival in the title. Here's a quick summary that may help others in deciding that another book is likely more helpful. Dogs and other animals can be dangerous, if something has a warning label/sign then pay attention to that, don't eat mushrooms in your front yard, and finally if you are using tools and or knives be sure to cut away from yourself.Humor is to be found in the suggestion that if you are attacked, defending yourself with anything other than your fists is a bad idea. Wow.I only blame myself for purchasing the book. Now to throw it away."
1,Complete Garbage,"I was looking for an advanced urban survival guide. Perhaps some clever ways to make traps, collect water, find and store food, conceal weapons, blend in, etc....What I got, was a Nanny in a book. WARNINGS posted in red on every page on how dangerous things like, scissors are! This book is utter crap. I will use it to wipe my ass in an emergency situation. This IS NOT AN SAS book. Its a book written by a british schoolboy."
2,The Encyclopedia of Paranoia,"Wow. This book is definitely comprehensive. Wiseman's book on Wilderness Survival is great for people to survive in the wilderness on nothing. This book is written for people in Britain that have never seen civilization. I guess I was looking for a type of survival book to cover how to survive in an urban setting in a major disaster. This book covers everything from ""don't eat moth balls"" to ""don't plant willow trees too close to your house or you might weaken your foundation"". Most of the stuff is ridiculous common sense.The one area I was interested in was Self-Defense. Unfortunately this was just a lot of British Law stuff.Overall the book is pretty comprehensive but more or less ridiculous. You have to be insane to read it cover to cover. And if you're not, you will be by the time you finish it."
1,chair exercises for senors,i was very disappointed in this video very boring music and activities. much too expensive for conent
1,this is not a hardcover book and is lacking the real music !,"this is a paperback version and not this non-music reading version. look closely at the top of the books image. This is a ""EZPLAY"" version. It has juvenile jumbo notes in this version and only has the vocal notes --- no real chords or chord charts. beware if youre wanting the guitar, piano and vocal version. THIS IS NOT THE SAME BOOK."
4,Works as advertise,"I had a need for an adhesive that would not lose it bonding strength after a certain period of time.This loctite adhesive is pretty good stuff. It's holding up well so far , no complaints here. I wouldrecommend giving it a try."
1,extremely dull knife,"This knife is so dull, even after using the knife sharpener that came with it. It's useless. We're still using our old filet knife."
2,Ok strings,These strings have a very good sound but as soon as i put them on my violin and tried to tune them the d string broke and then the next day i tried to tune the strings and the a string broke!!!!! would not recommend.
3,Can't judge,Bought this as a gift for someone else - don't play violin myself. Can't tell you anything about it's function.
3,Nice sounding Strings,"These are cheap, okay sounding strings, they are one of the kinds that are sold at a music shop in my area. I would highly recommend this product for beginners, I keep these as a spare. It may be worth the couple extra bucks to go with the next step up D'Addario strings, Pro Arte. You may be shocked at the results you get from higher end strings in terms of sound. All in all, these strings are great for players that are just starting out and are not sure if they will stick with the instrument, and as a spare set to carry around. They are definitely better though than the Super Sensitive strings that I've seen on some violins before."
4,Loved it,Has a lot of information that I was looking for. I couldn't put it down. A must read for those seeking some knowledge on this subject.
5,great for helping to learn along with a program,"This is a great way to learn how things are spelled and translating from english to czech. It also helps a little with pronunciation. However, it is best when used with a language program. Such as Pimsleur or any other program that helps you learn how to speak the language."
4,Enjoyable!,"I did enjoy reading all three books in this series. However, I did find the situation of Reagan ""moving in"" to Cash's house a little unreal. Especially back in those days, women just didn't do those kinds of things. And no one at the church batted an eyelash! Go figure..."
4,I thoroughly enjoyed this book,"I'm not sure why this book is getting thumbs down from other readers. As I often feel with Lori Wick books, you need to pay attention to the characters before you get them confused, but that enhances the mind-building of reading and is good mental exercise. I read this entire book in an evening, and again the next day. It isn't quite Sophie's Heart, but it is a very good book!"
2,City Girl,I love Lori Wick books! But I was so disappointed in City Girl. The other two Yellow Trillogy books were wonderful with great plots and storys. But I felt that Ms. Wick wanted to get this story done with and didn't give Cash a great story line that he deserved. I will continue to read all of Lori Wick books but this one was boring!
2,eh,"alright, so i caved in & downloaded the grimfist album. the only thing that comes to mind is ""meh"". it's good, not amazing & my jaw certaintly didnt hit the floor when i listened to it. the album kind of reminds me of the scene in High Fidelity where john cusack says "" i just wanna listen to something i can ignore."" nothing original, nothing really inspiring, i'll probably listen to it once a year. i'm just glad i didn't pay for it.i'll stick to Zyklon"
3,OK,"Not as good as Purpendicular, Bananas or Rapture of the Deep but still a good line-up and a must have for Gilan fans."
3,Interesting effort,"Interesting effort by Purple with this first-grade line-up, but the album is clearly below the patterns established in the amazing ""PURPENDICULAR""."
1,Dissapointment,"I am a begginer in the field of currency trading. I don't usually take the time to review somebody's work, I am bussy with my own; however, this book has been such a dissapointment. I don't think that the writer was terribly concern with the reader's improvement in the field rather than excite him to invest in e-trading. I assume that the fact that he, the writer, owns an e-trading firm is enough of a proof for this statement. Don't buy it!"
5,As good as it gets.....,"The more you understand the golf swing, the more you will appreciate how elegant Manuel's approach to the game is.Quite simply, one of the best teachers ever.I highly recommend this DVD. Give the concepts their due time, absorb them, see them, and you will be playing great golf.Well done Manuel, well done."
3,Ole!,"Connie Francis'60s ethnic ouevre gets a little spicier with this set of Spanish and Latin American favorites. What can one say about this album? Francis proved she could sing anything with her ethnic discography. Francis sings ""Malaguena"" with the ferocity of a bullfight, while crooning ""Vaya Con Dios"" with tearful poignancy. Thats the Connie Francis style that made her pop hits so great. She applies it beautifully in this genre set. If you want just a taste of this genre, check out THE VERY BEST OF CONNIE FRANCIS Vol 2."
5,Awesome air rifle,"Awesome air rifle, very accruate.Mine came with a very stiff trigger--however the trigger is adjustable via a screw in the trigger. Mine is down to 4.3 pounds and 1.4"" pull.Sold by Daisy they are made by HATSAN ARMS COMPANY of Turkey, see: http://www.hatsan.com.tr/index.html"
1,no scope - absolutely defrauded - beyond upset,"The product description clearly states that this comes WITH a scope. That is why I purchased. No scope was included with the rifle. If this was in error, someone should fix the website. I am going to seek satisfation with the retailer. Not OK that I have to spend my time on getting this fixed. I will say that Amazon ha always come through in the case of a bad retailer so far ... which is why I continue to use them. I hope that is still the case."
3,Decent Collection,"You know, I've noticed that people who write reviews on here either go overboard with their praise, or they pan the book. Well not here.Folks, let me say this about Equal Love: it's pretty good. There is accomplished prose throughout, several very good stories, one or two excellent stories and a couple average ones.For the most part, I enjoyed Mr. Davies voice and although I will not pronounce this a five star work of brilliance, I will be looking forward to more of his work.Overall, a solid and worthy effort."
1,A Great Solider's Story Poorly Told,"Somewhere in the pages of this paperback book is a story, but Robert Boven is not the person to be telling it. This is suppose to be the story of the most decorated soldier in WWII, told by Mr. Robert W. Boven who was suppose to have served in Europe in this same War. When the author refers to ""Patton Tanks"" coming in at the end of the War to take on the better armored German Tanks, the German ""Long Tom"" artillery, and planes going down because of ""motor failure"" (how about the word ""engine""), he lost too many points with this historian. In his credits he list his 10 years of interviews and travels with Matt Urban, yet there is fewer than 40 words in quotes throughout the book, and 35 of those are on page 89. Save your money folks, this poor quality item should serve as an example on how to not write a book. The author's credits show him as a writer of travelogues, that must be his forte because writing history certainly is not."
3,Good price. okay product.,"price is good, but product so-so. remote works to about 15 or 20 feet when signal passing through home walls. wish it transmitted greater distance. alarm is not very loud on either unit, but sufficient to wake from light sleep if remote receiver in bedroom. i used velco to attach to wall within a couple of feet of sump pump grate/cover. cord holding senseor about 2 1/2 feet long."
4,"Informative, but graphic.",Great in depth look at realistic Crime Scene work. No CBS CSI hear. Some graphic photos (ie: dead bodies). Wouldn't suggest viewing if not interested in the career field.
1,Creepy,A friend recommended this book to me and what I read was a bit creepy. Lots of things like flirting w/ your father and the whole good touch thing. The books needs to be more about girls relationships w/ their fathers and not our heavenly father. Sneaky attempt at pushing God down peoples throats.
4,Poor help service,"I spent a long time waiting on a non 800 number for a little help with this program. After finally getting a real person, he didn't even know what I was talking about. After an hour on the phone where he did ""research"" the problem was not resolved and he had no idea how to even identify it to resolve it. I spent money (phone bill) and time for nothing. The program itself is pretty good if you don't ever need any help because they don't have a help service on the CD, it just tells you to go to Windows which doesn't help with business card questions.I would like to add that since I switched to Windows 7, I have had nothing but problems with this softward even though calling them (much confusion there) ended up with them telling me that it was fully compatable. I would not purchase this software again. It is difficult to use and to figure out."
4,Business Card Factory Deluxe,"Easy to use, and lots of templates to look at. Good software for the price."
1,I could not watch it,It was incompatible with my computer so I have no idea whether or not it is good. I will have to wait until I can find a way to play it on another medium. All DVDs I have play on my laptop except this one. I wish Amazon in conjunction with Chuck could produce a product that is more user-friendly...Or at least indicate on the buy page the system requirements to play their videos because then I would have simply bought the downloadable version of it. Alternatively they could send information with the product to assist buyer in working around this problem. Now I am not sure about buying DVDs on Amazon in future since I imagine they will not play ... bummer! Given that I love buying stuff on Amazon.
4,Great cover! Fit perfectly my Fender Frontman 212,"Great fit and logo! Wish they have used a thicker vinyl for better protection against hits, but it does the job well."
5,Exceeded my expectations,"I purchased this knowing that this was a graphic noveland only because I needed to fill a shipment for free shipping.Having read 2 reviews, i purchased this knowing that ihave absolutely no interest in Orcs.This novel follows the actions of a bunch of Orc bombers whilethey crash and burn from one mission to the next.As i was turning the pages, i found myself chuckling to myselftime and time again. This short graphic novel is an extremelyfast read but i found the actions of the Orcs tobe quite entertaining and very fun.The artwork could have been better but it sort ofmatched the style of the orcs.I would recommend this to anyone with at leastsome rudimentary understanding of the WH40k world.A solid 5 stars when you consider the subjectand style of this graphic novel."
5,Awesome speakers!,"I bought two of these speakers to serve has a front L-R setup in my home theater and they are great! The sound is perfect and crisp and I couldn't be happier!I was hesitant to invest in in-wall speakers and wondered how they'd compare to either my JBL floor-standing speakers or my Bose cubes and have to say, these speakers sound just as good and powerful. I would recommend a solid sub though to help with the low frequencies."
3,"Nice speaker, very bad costumer service","bought 2 pairs of these speakers, sound it's ok, but they were lost, send late, awfull costumer service, at the end they were whit me, almost 2 months late..."
4,I would recommend this book.,I started this book due to my love of historic romance novels and this does not disappoint. I started reading it and did kinda become bored in the beginning and often started other books while taking a break from this book. But once I stuck with it I couldn't put it down. I would stay up til 1:00 in the morning and then get up in the morning and read again before I went to work. I was reading on my lunch hour and any other time I had a minute. This pulls you in and you are fighting for a happy ending along with the everyone in the book. When you start to read this book you will quickly figure out how it will end but it is still worth the ride this author takes you on. If you love historical romances I am telling you stick with this book and you will be glad you did. I am already starting on the next book in this series.
3,The Mistress of Trevelyan,"I enjoyed this book. Strong female character, and children to identify with. Just enough sexual tension for my active imagination."
5,A great read for a rainy day!,"I'm not one to write a lot of reviews but this book really captured my imagination. I love romances but I've never been one to read gothic romances very much. Well, that's about to change. From the first page I was sucked into this story. The author has a gift for descriptive phrases. I also love San Francisco so that made it all the more special to me. Please, please keep writing."
3,Aztecs,"I wanted to read a general book on the Aztecs to round out some of my knowledged of Middle and South American Civilizations. This was a colorful though very general book on the subject, typical of other Time-Life books on selected topics. Wonderfully illustrated and with an extensive bibliography full of material for further investigation, it makes an adequate starting point for further research. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in the topic, in anthropology, or in Mexico."
4,Helpful,I had been feeling stuck for a long while and this book helped me come up with a plan to finally take action to create the life I want.
3,"masterly playing, poor sound quality","Solomon was a master, with a soft unassuming touch and great sonority, but one can hardly tell it from this early performance, so poorly recorded originally that no transfer has been able to make it sound decent. Still, it's Solomon. There's a later version of the Tchaikov. 1st, with Dobrowen, on an EMI Tchaikov. box, expensive even as a cut-out. I like the performance more with Hartry, although the sound is much better on the Dobrowen. Also, there's lots of great Solomon on APR and Testament, and in the Philips 2CD set in the Great Pianists series -- Chopin solos, Brahms concertos, Beethoven concertos and sonatas -- and more. UPDATE 2007: An excellent transfer of the Solomon/Hartry Tchaik. 1st is now available on the Naxos Historical label (8.110680)."
4,ztable top timer,"Timer seems to be working fine, but hten again, so did the previous one. Makes it easier to turn lamp on and off, without reaching around end table to hit switch."
2,Stopped working,"After a little over 1 year, one of two units stopped switching the outlet on/off. The 'controller' works, but the switched outlet doesn't.Unit arrived with a bad coin cell battery, too.I recommend Amazon pull these off the market. Too many fail, and one reviewer indicated possibility of fire.Oh, and the description still says there is an untimed outlet on the side. Neither of my units has the outlet, which I did want to use to charge a cell phone."
3,Not as good as Avatar,"I purchased this book for my son because he likes the Avatar books so much. He is one of those children that will not read unless the book is of great interest. So I figured he loved watching Naruto and would also enjoy the book. Well for starters the book Naruto has to be read from back to front, wich he complained about. All and all the delivery was great and so was the condition of the book but not the most 9 year old catching book I've gotten. I guess it depends on the reader."
5,almost perfect- 100% satisfied!,The book arrived on time and it was almost perfect. worth way more than i paid. Thank you!
2,Only for newbies,"I must say it is not what I expected. Basically, if you know nothing about PL/SQL, that is, the Oracle extension of the SQL, and you need to grasp its general concept in a very short time, this is the book for you.But the subtittle of the book is definitely misleading. When it comes to advanced topics, the book simply copies from the online documentation from Oracle, but only the brief summery. Say, function DECODE, one of the most powful feature in PL/SQL, is covered in half a page! Just the official definition. Nothing to read about. If you bought Oracle 9i The Complete Reference, you'd find a whole chapter devoted to that function.The author didn't do much work with this book. If you're a serious programmer, don't bother with this book."
4,Thank you for the insight,"I'm a graduate social work student and I recently wrote a paper about Billie for a class on counseling creative clients. From a strengths perspective, Billie's life was a creative success. She lived true to herself and she lived for herself. Given the enormous odds she faced, as a black woman in that time period, she overcame much. Ms. Griffin has done her justice and I highly recommend her book."
3,mannafestgodsglory,"It is a good book, I needed it for class and doing reports on it. there you go. Español es muy bien, me gustan comer taco bell"
5,AWESOME,Rascal Flatts fans won't be disappointed. It's nice to be able to get a glimpse of their life on the road and the people they get to travel with. Also if you haven't had the opportunity to see them live this gives you an idea of how powerful and exiting their shows are. I would highly recommend buying this for those of us who enjoy their music.
1,I'm unimpressed,"On: Test Smart, by Gary W. Abbamont and Antoinette BrescherMy mom bought this book to prepare me for my 9th grade standardized test. Though I found this book helpful in the area of refreshing my memory on how standardized tests work, and gave me a couple of new logical deduction techniques; I found it otherwise useless and dry. It was difficult to read because it made me drowsy by constantly repeating the same phrases over, and over again. (And I actually enjoy unabridged classical literature, such as Jules Verne's books.) Over-all I found ""Test Smart"" unimpressive.Gabe White, 9th grade"
4,"Beautiful, tall","These Fluevogs run true to size.I purchased an 11 thinking they'd run to size like the darlings & qtee's, boy was I wrong! I have to stuff the toes in this pump so my heels dont slide out.Also, be aware that the hell is 4 or 4.5"" tall. There is not platform, so its quite the heel height. Regardless, they are quite comfortable. The flare at the heel helps with walking. The shoe is cushioned well, and supports my high arch well.They do run narrow-to-average width and are not as wide as some other fluevogs.The shoe is extremely shiney, and I shine mine before wearing them out still."
5,That Which is Endless Does Not End,"""The Kindly Ones"" is the climax of the Sandman series. This is where all the work that came before reaches it's pentacle. Several of the characters mentioned in early arcs are back, and this arc serves as a good beginning of the end for the series.Lyta Hall sets off to get revenge against Dream who owns her child, Daniel, and whom she believes has taken him from her. And whilst the plot is about her, the story is about knowing that the end is coming and facing it with dignity and about accepting punishment for one's actions with grace. As in several other arcs, the plot has little to do with Dream, but the story is all his. Like the rest of the stories, this is one that needs to be read multiple times to get everything that's going on because Gaiman weaves several layers.Whilst you might miss Dream, the ending to this book helps you realise that which is Endless never ends, it just becomes something new."
1,Uncomfortable,This is a very uncomfortable boot. It puts a lot of stress and strain on the ankle. I wear some type of boot almost everyday but could not wear these for even a few minuets. My daughters could not wear them either. They do look cute though. We returned these boots.
2,"Cute Boots, but OUCH","Really cute boots, but the back zipper made my heels feel as if they weren't supported, and about to slide out. The 4"" heels force your feet into a near ballerina toe pose and I had to take these off after half a day. My next step is to try some insoles for them and maybe that will help."
2,Not what I expected,These boots have yet to be worn by me. The arch is way too high and akward and very uncomfortable and makes it darn near impossible to wear and walk in. I don't recommmend them unless you find yourself walking in 6 inch stilettos and needing a break.
5,Perfect Fall / Winter Boot!,"These boots are still selling in major department stores for $130! They are a great staple for the Fall / Winter Season coming! Very sleek, stylish sexy boot!! I love them...I only wish they had my size in the brown!"
1,Very disappointing performance.,"There must be something wrong with this radio. I own three other shortwave receivers; a Panasonic RF-B65 which I purchased in 1989, a Zenith Trans-Oceanic 3000 from the early 1960s, and a Zenith Trans-Oceanic G500 tube set which was built in 1950, and is about the size of a small suitcase, and uses tubes instead of transistors. Either one of these radios, in shortwave mode, will completely blow the Eton E1 out of the room. As I said, there must be something wrong with the Eton E1."
2,A mixture of good and bad,"With nearly all portable SW radios made in China now, you can expect some quality control issues. But in a $500 portable radio? I bought mine to use during power outages in hurricane season. I didn't even take it out of the box until the first hurricane of the season, and the display was defective (a problem that is rampant in these radios). After spending another $250 to get a new display, I had a bad taste in my mouth. This radio is a combination of excellent engineering and design (with the help of Drake Radio) and absolutely horrid materials and quality control. The era of the high quality SW portable radio is fading faster than this radio's display screen. Grundig should have built it in the Western World for $200 more. It could be a marvelous $700 radio with high quality parts. Instead, it is a Rolls Royce built with Yugo parts. I would rather have a Yugo built with Rolls Royce parts."
3,Book review,The book appears to be factual but slightly selective. More info on each incident would help. Supporting photos (usually available) woulfd help a lot.Easy to read and understand for those interested in aviation.
1,bogus book,"this book was disappointing, didn't provide elementary things like a timeline to show how much time elapsed between events; very little original insight in the narrative, just basically packaged the transcripts verbatim and sold it. don't bother!"
1,it takes a lot of nerve to list this fake on Amazon,"this isn't a licensed t, it is a cheap iron-on that would embarrass you to be caught wearing."
1,"dont buy, very poor quality recording",this is not dvd-audio quality sound...... 5.1 ch 44khz/24bit sounds really bad..the 2 ch 96khz/24bit anit much better..a regualar 44khz cd would sound just as good as this dvd-audio cd.. the worst sounding dvd-audio cd i got. i didnt know dvd-audio was recorded this low 44khz till i got this cd in mail. 44khz is what regular cds is recorded in.
5,Best face scrub for sensitive skin!,"I recently had an allergic reaction to something, so I started to re-examine all my cosmetics. I decided to go more organic and found this fantastic Lavender line. This scrub brightens my skin and preps it for the ultimate moisturizer that I use after that. The result has been a softer, brighter looker skin with less visible lines."
5,A touching Movie,"This movie is not action packed, but there are a few spots where it did get intense. This was such a nice, clean movie with a beautiful message. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to watch something uplifting. Life can get hard sometimes, and it is through those hardships that, if faced with courage, can change us for the better. Beautiful and wonderfully made, I highly recommend this."
4,Amazing movie,My son very like this movie. About 3D the movie has great in depth but poor in pop out screen.
2,Not as good as I expected!,"HUGO was not as good as I expected. It is too complex for very young children . While OK as an adult-older child film, it did not live up to it's academy award status. I believe that seeing it in full 3-D would greatly add to it's impact, but unfortunately, I could not."
3,Long and Drawn Out - There are better choices for under 10,Could have been a 30 minutes shorter than the 2+ hours to keep kids interest.It was a good movie but not as entertaining as the online reviews rated it.At times the content shifted from a children's movie to more of a mature storyline but there were some amusing characters for children. I wouldn't rent it again. Better choices include the Narnia collection.p.s. You just gotta love the British accents of all characters while in the PARIS setting.
4,Hugo,Great movie when veiwed in 3-D format. The workings of the clock is realistic and the ending is perfect! I would highly recommend this movie in any format.
4,Entertaining and heartfelt,Hugo is a great movie. The special effects are outstanding but not overly used. The acting is great. I recommend it!
4,Very satisfying,"Enjoyed this movie very much. Besides being extraordinarily clean, the visuals are outstanding, the acting superb and the story magical. You must watch not only with your eyes but also with your heart."
4,"GREAT FILM , BUT FRANKLY...NOT THE BEST PICTURE OF THE YEAR.","TO BE HONEST, THERE AIN'T NO FILMS TO BE CALLED ""THE BEST PICTURE OF THE YEAR"", EVEN ""THE ARTIST"" IS A LITTLE DISSAPOINTING."
2,ok movie from good guy scorsese,"The movie is very formulaic except for the awesome performance by sasha baron cohen. The pace is rigid, the characters range from caricatures to hollow husks. Cool combination of colors create an interesting feeling for the somewhat steampunk world but the lack of variety makes it a stale note as the movie progresses. The admiration towards the birth of cinema shown in the movie feels a bit forced and self indulgent. Feels like Martin Scorsese didn't feel comfortable making the movie."
3,"DIDNT LIKED IT , EVEN ON BLU-RAY RELEASES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I had HIGH HOPE for this movie because of trailer & all those Awards shows they got & all.Yes all in Technical, Visual & special effects is Stunning to watch, BUT story & movie real boring & drags a lot here & there. Almost middle of the movie I just reject it from player & send it back coz..was rental & glad didnt buy this lame azz boring B.S.. & WORST thing about this movie,it is BIG in Visual & special effects >> Then BLU RAY version IS NOT Widescreen is 1.85.1 ratio/ full screen.. even in 3D version.. should be 2.40.1 or 2.35:1 ratio Format on BLU-RAY for Theather released movie ... is just all B.S about this flick,. Even on blu-ray releases.. didnt liked it, Just gives 3 stars & that extra star for the visual & effects is amazing & worth those awards they got..But movie is Sucked & boring ! C+"
4,Review: Hugo,"Received purchase without issues. Preferred packaging was used (small box, no peanuts). I look forward to making similar DVD purchases."
3,Ok movie,Some parts were interesting; and some were not. Older kids would probably like it because the main characters are children.
1,Bourgeoisie at the movie,"For all the hype Hugo has gathered, this is a clunker filled with melodramas and cliche. We are peasants and surely the movie will be great only if the cast spoke with English accents et Maman et Papa.I speak French and talk about the actress who has a horribly irritating accent worse than getting your tooth out. I am die hard fan of Scorsese but this will his worst by far. The story is simple while taking too long. I have seen better on the TV.When will we make American movies. Are we that insecure? In short, rent it and let us eat cake!"
2,way too long,"The premise is good and I cared about Hugo, but too much was put into this movie - it was way tooo long."
5,Absolutely Genius and Brilliant,"Martin Sorcesese is absolutely brilliant to have brought the magic of Brian Selznick's book into such a brilliant realm of film. For those who miss the magic of this story I truly feel sorry. It isn't just about the visual but the magic of the story and the horror of what happened to early film after the Great War. The story has so much meaning. I wonder if Brian Selznick is related to David O. Selznick, of early Hollywood days? If so I bet he was the little boy who saw Geroges Milies studio. I had goosebumps at the end of this movie because of the rare chance to see and feel true genius in its many forms."
5,Growing experience,"Paris, and grownup authorities, seen through the eyes of a child. A great movie for the whole family. I will watch it again and again with friends and family"
5,Loved it!,This movie was so cute. I loved it and would love to buy it so I can see it over and over.
1,That Was An Ordeal,I'm glad I got this through Netflix and did not buy it. This movie seems to go on and on and on with no where to go. Don't understand all the praise this film received. To each his own.
1,Long and Boring,"What a waste of film The story was boring Boring 30 min story made to last to two hours. unbeleiveable that it was ever released,"
1,This movie looked to be so promising,"This movie looked to be so promising. One big commercial for movie preservation. We are pretty easily entertained at our house, but this fell short.Positively beautiful cinematography though."
2,Buyer Beware,"Note that this listing for ""Hugo"" is not a US region copy and won't play on US machines. It ships out of the UK and is coded for their region.Hugo (Blu-ray 3D)"
2,Hugo,"Maybe this is a great movie, but I felt it was a disappointment. Great old movie clips though; the story of Georges Melies appears to be mostly true, the rest is poetic license, I believe."
4,Movie Review,"The ""purchase"" was the viewing of movie Hugo, so that I could stream it on my television with a friend. In a sense it isn't a product review but a service review. Everything expected went without a hassle."
5,I loved Hugo!,"The sets were awesome and completely new. Almost magical inner workings of the clocks and the station, and Hugo's talent for figuring out mechanical workings. Loved the old movies that Grandpa finally allowed to be shown - they were a fantastic inclusion to the story."
1,Terrible Product,The digital download is an incredibly painful process to use. It will not work with your iTunes library. You need to set up multiple accounts and it will most likely still not work. If you are going to buy this for the digital download do not! Purchase from the iTunes store. Amazon will not stand behind this when it does not work. BEWARE!
2,Profoundly Boring,"Beautiful film - yes. But the story? Without giving anything away, I guess all I can say is that it starts off in one direction, skids sideways into another direction, and then totally jumps the rails into a plot that ends up having little or nothing to do with what you thought was going on. And while in some films this is a really good thing - in this one there is no big reveal, no big amazing denouement, just switching gears for the sake of switching gears. There was no real character development, so no real affection for the characters. Bored enough to wander off and start playing Facebook games, and completely unthrilled by the ending. Sorry. It was very pretty, though."
5,"Love trains, adventure for little boys, and clocks? Try this one!","It was enough that it had Academy award nominations, but then it won several! I was intrigued and I was not disapppointed. With young grandchildren who visit and like to watch movies, it was a sure bet to fill a couple of hours. It has been a hit, and Grandma has now watched it 3 times! I love the setting, the plot and of course the little boy who is an orphan making his own way in the world. He steals food and clock parts and nearly gets caught. Lots of drama and wonderful scenes of Paris. It is fun and heartwarming and intriguing. Don't miss it!"
4,Very good,"The movie breaks some ground on new technology, the complexity of the computer generated design is excellent. The plot is somewhat predictable but good nonetheless. Definitely this a feel-good movie for all audiences"
3,It's Ok...,The movie was overhyped. I expected the picture to be spectacular on blu-ray to make up for it but it was mediocre.
2,"Well, I tried to like it.","Nominated for Best Picture by an Academy that never heard of Georges Melies and needed to get hip fast, the androgynous boy displays the acting ability of a still photograph, the girl looks like Ingrid Bergman, and the picture has the pace of a snail with lead poisoning. How do they spend money like this and get no human feeling at all? Get the bad taste out of your mouth with THE MAGIC BOX, CINEMA PARADISO, hell, even MATINEE. But stay away from poseurs who think blue is artistic."
3,Not memorable.,"With all the hype surrounding this movie, I thought this is really going to be good. It turned out to be a pleasant and non threatening movie in the sense of there not being any cursing, sex, or violence present in it. However, upon reflection, there is nothing enduring about this movie for me. There are several movies out there that I clearly don't mind seeing many times over, and when I do, I see them with a fresh perspective. They don't wear out on me after the first go around. That's why I would buy a movie rather then rent it - because of its' replay value. Hugo is not one of those movies. I saw it, yawned a little, but I don't have the desire to return to it. So so movie after all. I'm probably being generous with giving it three stars. All that pomp just to say that everyone has value. Whatever floats your boat, I guess. Really, no big whoop for me. Would like my $20 back, but that's a fantasy too."
3,"Over-rated and over-hyped, but not bad.","Given how many Oscars this movie was nominated for, I went out and purchased it right away.As other people have noted, this isn't really a movie, so much as a documentary about Georges Melies, the early silent film director.The plot is a bit haphazard, and develops painfully slowly. I watched this with a group and most people left before it was over.The production values are very good: I can see why it was nominated for technical areas. But this isn't a movie for most people (including myself). It is pretty clearly aimed at people who love the history and value the technical production values to a level where plot, dialog, and pacing are less important."
3,HUGO,My husband and I enjoyed the movie. It kept you interested but did not lose you in the current and past episodes. We both liked the movie.
4,Cute and enjoyable,Scorsese is genius. And I really like seeing this other side of him. Asa Butterfield showed the diversity fo the boy and the need to connect with his father so well. Touching movie. See it.
3,Interesting,This movie was interesting but I would have preferred to have more Ben Kingsley. I don't think kids would appreciate it.
2,a real disappointment,"Not what I expected. Doesn't mean it was a bad movie, it wasn't bad, just not great. It was an ok movie, on the same scale as some of the less popular Disney films. From the previews though, I expected more. I sort of felt betrayed; that is, the only good parts were in the previews.Much like the Bridge to Terabithia, a complete RIP OFF! The previews showed only the fantasy sequences leading viewers and buyers to believe it was going to be a film about all these cool animated characters. Instead it was a horribly sad story about a selfish, self centered kid and his only friend who died. The fantasy scenes touted in all the previews were only five minutes of the actual film. Hugo's advertising was very similar although Hugo was a better film than Terabithia."
2,Short Story,"This is short story of the initial evacuation of Landing, passed off as a novel. It is not bad, but not worth the price of a book"
3,Music Overkill,"The film is fine although I prefer the original Swedish version, agreeing with previous reviews. The music however is overbearing, dumps over dialogue in several scenes, and is simply overdone. While I like Reznor's work, this is simply too loud and brash, diminishing what could have been 4 stars instead of 3"
3,Not tied together too well.,The story was really slow and then once it was all in motion I don't feel as if the director had a clear understanding of the story. He didn't seem to tie the story together too well and it didn't seem very realistic.However I did like how the girl with the dragon tattoo put her perverted executor in his place. She was a powerful little woman. I liked her.I had trouble understanding the male lead. He mumbled a lot.That's my take.
3,Remake or original?,"Having first watched the original extended versions of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl who Played with Fire and The Girl who Kicked the Hornets' Nest, I was rather disappointed with the new Daniel Craig version. The Swedish version starring Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist is absolutely brilliant and gripping throughout. Watch the Millennium Trilogy with a friend over a weekend. You will thoroughly enjoy the experience."
4,"Intense Drama,Rooney Mara mesmerizing","The DVD arrived very promptly .The story is one you have to pay very close attention to as the pieces of the puzzle connect all through the film.It is one you either have to stop and repeat a scene or watch the whole thing over.I hope there is a sequal. A disturbing rape scene you may want to fast forward with eyes shut,volume off."
3,"well,....","I have to say I disagree with a number of people here in that I think that the original swedish version of this book was much better than this ""Hollywood"" one.Most of the time I find the original first ones(european) better than the american ones....But maybe the mainstream audience is not used to the different pace of european (or also asian)movies.Of course that might also have to do with the foreign language and the subtitles.It's just easier to see a movie in your own language....The acting here was decent but not as good as from the swedish actors I thought.Daniel Graig is not a Blomquist.And the girl was also a bit flat in her dynamic I felt.I am sure a lot of people won""t agree with me but that's ok.If you haven't seen the swedish trilogy do yourself a favor and at least check it out."
3,A well-made film for Americans who haven't read the book,"Loved the books, loved the original films, generally love Fincher's style and direction. This is a well-made film for Americans who haven't read the book or seen the original film. 50 minutes in I was bored and wanted to turn it off, but I wanted it to get better so I left it on. The movie stayed on and I folded laundry."
3,Not quite,"I'd read all three ""Girl"" books before all the hubbub started about the movies - both Swedish and American - and had become quite intrigued by the quirky genius of Elizabeth Solander, the main character. I'd also watched all three Swedish movies on my Kindle Fire before I'd even heard of the American remake. After reading the other reviews, I rented the American version to get another take on Elizabeth. I was disappointed. To be honest, I can't quite put my finger on the reasons for it, but to me Elizabeth lost her sharp edginess in this version. One thing was that in her first appearance in this film, she wore the ""in-your-face"" Goth outfit that didn't show up until the culminating court scene in the Swedish film. It seemed that her radical appearance was the high point, and her ability to fascinate ebbed downward from there. End result? I much preferred the Swedish original."
3,Eye Candy,"I love that Fincher included MANY elements from the novel that the Swedish film left out - Mikael's relationship with his daughter, Lisbeth's crew of hackers in Great Britain, her disappointment with Mikael & Erika; but, I was surprised at the trite 'American' stereotyping slipped in - Burhman portrayed as boyishly fat and so 'merely' a lustful opportunist in his sexuality rather than an abusive sadist. Still, I appreciated Fincher making his point of view brilliantly clear, in chrome, and his use of sound particularly with the dinner scene in Martin Vanger's home. Also loved Daniel Craig's humor. I rented to see the opening credits and the Hollywood gloss over of architectural eye candy. Also hoped the home viewing would help me appreciate Rooney Mara's portrayal enough to see the next Fincher installment for the price of a theater ticket. Much more satisfying with a remote control in hand."
3,sound quality problem,This review is not of the film but rather the Amazon streaming. We only watched a few minutes as the sound quality of the Amazon streaming was not very good. It would be extremely helpful if Amazon Video On demand offered the opportunity to watch the captions/subtitles. Netflix does offer subtitle control on the new Roku.
1,poor sound quality and picture,"Could not watch more than 15 minutes of this, I was left wishing for subtitles like in the Swedish version so I could follow the dialog, very poor quality"
2,Hard for someone who hasn't read it,"It's a lively dark movie with fabulous portrayals of characters who have HUGE meaning for fans and devotees of the book. The rest of us must pay very very close attention to catch what's actually going on, whom to sympathize with, and when it's going to end. It's long and forget the popcorn. It's violent and ugly."
2,Pales by Comparison with the Swedish Trilogy,"I don't know how I would have rated this film had I not already seen the Swedish trilogy of films, or if I had not read the books. This American version tries to condense all three books into one film. In so doing, it loses much in content and changes other plot elements in an effort to achieve continuity within the abridged story lines. Had I not read the books, I would have found the continuity even more problematic and the changes were sometimes actually bothersome. Also, the actors in the Swedish version look more as I would have pictured them and seem more comfortable in their roles - this is particularly true of the female lead. I highly recommend the Swedish trilogy of films and might have liked this one more had I not seen them."
3,Book,"I was hoping that this book would be similar to the book, it left out some of the key things that were in the book but the movie was still good."
5,Amazing read,"I love the character Lisbeth, she is quite awesome...I won't spoil it for you, but this book is worth reading."
1,Not the right item,"I was excited to be getting this product in the mail, but that quickly changed when the product was not what I had ordered. It was not the steelbook version of the movie, but rather the movie in a regular, plastic case. I paid a lot of money for an item that was supposed to be a steel book, but instead got something I could have found in the store. Very disappointed with this order and seller."
1,Horrible,"My wife and I rented this movie for date night, but instead, got offended by the vulgarity and rough nature of this film. Why the rape scene, seriously?"
2,Not the quality of product I wanted,This product was a copied video sold in the original packaging. The dvd freezes and is not what i wanted.
1,Not what was advertised,This was listed as having the Blue-ray/DVD/Ultraviolet the DVD was a home made copy the Blueray works I havn't tried the digital down load yet but my expectations are not very high at this point.
4,"Intense, but enjoyable","Read all Larssen's books, and I have seen the movie once. I wanted my own copy, and for my husband to see it.I enjoyed the story very much and the character of Lisbeth Salander and the actress' interpretation. I always getgreat service from Amazon--my order comes in a timely fashion and exactly what I ordered. Never have to worryabout returns."
5,great thriller,"This movie was great. lots of surprises, suspense, and an all around good mystery movie. i will be waiting for the sequels that will follow."
2,Get the original,"I watched the Swedish trilogy before watching this one. WOW what a difference. The Swedish version with its longer format went into much more detail and character development. In short, if you don't mind dubbing or reading subtitles, get the Millennium Trilogy and leave this one behind. Noomi Rapace makes a much better Lisbeth Salander than Rooney Mara could ever dream to be."
1,See the original,"Why remake a film when the original is great?If found Daniel Craig lacking.I also did not appreciate the gratuitous nudity. The book handled it well. The first version of this film handled it great. In this version, it was gratuitous."
1,The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,The underlying violence and dark nature of this film loses me. I rented it for someone else. I do hate such movies.
5,Great Movie,Brilliant story line - produced and directed to keep your interest right through the movie. Preview gave me a very clear indication of what the film was all about.
2,A remake is a remake.,"First off, F word David Fincher. He sold his soul the day he put out the pandering ""Social Network"". Secondly, say all that you will, the film here is a remake of an adaptation. More money dumped into a garbage can does not change the garbage can into something other than a garbage can. Now, I like Daniel Craig. I do. He's cool. But as for the other actors, I don't really know of them. I'm sure they're cool, too. But I refuse to take exception everytime a bunch of people rave about something being good. I'll not watch this, and have no interest in changing my perception towards the original movie(s). I bet if advertised and angled right, chugging bleach would get consumers all lathered up to try. There. I actually feel better having said what was on my mind.By the way, take every last bit of this with a grain of salt. Watch the movie or don't whatever. I just had a burning need to express my opinion. It happens."
2,Disappointing,Im very disappointed we sit down to watch the movie and right in the middle of it it stops and that was it . Never had anything like this happen. Hope I can get my money back.
2,"Okay, but....","I had high hopes of this adaptation, but sadly this version adds nothing to the original. The lead actors did a great job but the film overall lacked the visceral intensity of the original. The Swedish version is still the way to go - skip this one unless you don't really care."
1,The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Three-Disc Combo Blu-ray / DVD + UltraViolet Digital Copy) (Blu-ray),"The description of this product is misleading.1. Marketed as 'Region: All Regions. Will not play in region B (Australia). Went through the hassle of having to repackage and send back which took 2 weeks to reach Amazon, but replacement took over 4 weeks. Replacement also would not play. Note that web site has now changed Region to A so the reason for my original complaint was not sufficiently researched to identify the cause of the problem and so now the hassle to having to return again and get refund.2. DVD version is DVD-R with handwritten title which makes it look like a pirate version - very unprofessional !!Taking into account several instances of poor delivery times, poor packaging and similarly poor product quality assurance, will now consider dealing exclusively with Amazon UK as vast improvement in all of the above."
2,Hope she used sterilized tattoo needles.,"The only thing this movie showed me is full blown body tattos on what's her name probably has a emotional personality disorder or some other psychological issue.The film was very slow, fragmented and could barely hear the lines. In summary: boring. I rather watch reruns of Andy Griffith Show."
1,Hollywood does it again!,"Without the previous Swedish version I would probably be less critical. Everything that this version does differently is to its detriment. Subtleties are gone, the story is confused and give the impression that the director did not know himself what was happening. While I was riveted watching the Swedish version, I kept looking on my watch to see when the movie would end. Things that should be left to the viewer are spelled out--just how dumb does Hollywood think all viewers are! For example, Lisbeth does not fail to point out right away that she videotaped the rape using a fiber optics camera! The sappy ending is pathetic! Mara does a decent job but is no match for the stunning Rapace! Craig is completely out of place as a journalist. Too bad to do such a poor job with a good cast!"
5,Dixieland Christmas,"A fun CD for Christmas upbeat, children love it, gets you happy and makes you want to dance. FUN FUN"
5,Cardcaptor Sakura- The Sealed Card,"In this movie, Sakura finds out how she feels about Syaoran. Her class is doing a play for the festival and Sakura stars as princess. Syaoran and Melin come to the festival and bumps into Sakura at the amusment park. Every time Sakura wants to tell Syaoran how she feels, she gets interrupted. The day before Sakura's class does the play, she and her friends go to the amusment park. When they enter the mirror house, they feel the precence of a Clow Card. Some of Sakura's Sakura Cards get stolen from a strange girl. At the play the next day, Yamazaki gets hurt and can't play the prince at the play. Syaoran said he knew all the lines and was willing to do it. During the play, people started to disappear. At the end, Sakura finally tells Syaoran how she feels about him."
3,Cardcaptor Sakura-The Movie 2-(special edition),Good Japanese animated cartoon. Would recommend these be reviewed by adults before children view. Some contain adult material that may not be suitable
1,NOT WORTH THE PRICE,"You can buy new on Preiser 2 CDS including the music on this 1- CD and more of this great artist for about the same price of this -1- CD @$30.00. Unless the jewel case is 24 carat gold, Don't bother !!!!Since I wrote this review about 10 minutes ago- this item is now unavailable at $17.98 or new or used starting at $31.03- Makes no sense- go with the Preiser - just got Volume 2 last night WOW!!!!!"
3,"It was good, not the best....","The story line was so fast, I practically finished the book in one day. I think Ms. Byrd should have put a little bit more substance in this book."
2,Daised and Confused,"Robert X. Cringley manages to describe all the factors that explain the existance of the computer industry, he gives the who,what,when,why,and the how. Accidental EmpiresIs a very descriptive book written by a good author but for those of you who wish to find out about the computer industry the shorter way, then just watch, The Pirates Of Silicon Valley. It will explain things much quicker, and you can eat some popcorn while you watch. Now don't get me wrong this was a good book but, one would rather watch the movie than read the book. If you aren't a history fanatic of the computer industry than don't read this book it will confuse you. For you nerd out there read this book you will love it."
5,Outstanding! A Must Read If You Care About the Computer Biz,"This book has two important things going for it. First, it's accurate. (I know. I remember most of it happening just the way Cringely describes it.) The other thing, though, is that it's INCREDIBLY well written. Great style, keen wit, sharp insight. You couldn't ask for much more from a book like this."
4,A Better Earth,"This title which covers the first portion of the book does not prepare you for the amount of effort that this author has put into the solutions for the problems of the current society we live in. This is not escape to the stars, but a wake-up call to make the Earth a more hospitable environment for those who may want to stay here or visit. Philosophy is not abstraction it is the designing in the mind of plans for a perfecting of the environment the body finds itself living in. Bravo!"
4,The Tale of the One-Legged Flute Player,"David Rees has done what no one had previously; which was write a credible book on the band known as Jethro Tull. I like the warm, laid back style of the narrative. Also, another bonus is that Rees is impartial for the most part in relation to the songs and the band's history. However, Rees could have provided more insight into the songwriting and the nasty fallout that led to the dismissal of the classic lineup that lasted from 1972-1979. Overall a good read and a must for anyone wanting to know more about the genius of Tull"
5,Susan Branch at her best,"Autumn is my favorite season and this could well be one of my favorite cookbooks. As with any Susan Branch book, the illustrations are delightful. The recipes are great, too (and not only for the autumn season).This is a book that will lift your spirits on a gloomy day."
4,Learned more about my culture,"This book was very informative. Roberto Suro is an excellent writer, he used great resources. It's his first book I have read and won't be my last. It opened my eyes to alot of issues I wasn't aware of in my hispanic culture."
4,Almost great,"This is a very cool phone and it works perfectly. It's getting 4 stars instead of 5 because I dropped mine and it broke. What broke was the the button that sticks out of the phone about a half inch on its side. This is the button that you push to answer your phone with. This is a design flaw in the product. If the button was recessed into the ample sized handset, it would have been fine.Shipping time from the vendor was within the range published."
2,Cheap,The phone is very cheaply made. Not solid.I can almost hear person on other end and they can't hear me.
3,Neat but..,"Cool retro phone, looks authentic. Button does nothing as far as I can tell. Would be nice if the whole old school phone was available that a cell phone plugged into."
4,Great Kids game,"Too short for adults, but kids love it. I'm 32, and enjoyed playing until I basically mastered it and there were no new stages to play. If you've got younger children, this is a great game for them. Fun while the new challenges lasted, and is still fun for my niece/nephew who are 7 and 5."
4,"sweet, simple and thoroughly enjoyable","'The Cat Who Sniffed Glue' is my first foray into the world of 'cat mysteries' my Lilian Jackson Braun. I feared the book would be overly cute, juvenile and extremely girlie. Well it wasn't any of that. What I got was a well written, very basic mystery with a very wholesome Americana feel to it. Think of Garrison Keillor having a couple of cats and wanting to solve a murder mystery and, well, you have a good grasp of what this book is all about. I thought it was all very charming without being too sugar coated. I also love the cornball characters the author sprinkles in.Bottom line: great literature - NOT! But a sweet little mystery the whole family can enjoy. Recommended."
5,What happened to Harley and his wife?,"Harley Fitch and his wife are discovered murdered in their home. The scions of Pickax society are aghast, as the Fitch's are one of their own. I agree with the formal reviewer that there is no way to figure out whodunnit until the very end when they tell you, but I thoroughly enjoy the ride. The characters in this book are interesting and a bit off the beaten path, for the most part. Enjoy!"
1,About as good as the Hair soundtack,"This cd has no bass. It is so old school That Jesus drops some lyrics in it. If you are an old fan, looking for a drive down memory lane, please don't tell anyone you bought this and hide it to avoid much embarrasment."
3,Problems with longevity,"Okay, I can see why kids would want to do this project, but my problem is the sentence ""the finished project should never be immersed in water or dry cleaned because the richness of the colors will fade or bleed."" Now, how do you reconcile a project for kids with a result that you cannot wash? Added to that, the prep for this is to soak the fabric in alum. I have it from an authority I trust that alum will rot the fabric if it is not rinsed out. Decide for yourself."
4,4 stars,"This book is one of the few books out there to deal with the ashtanga system. It is very readable; I personally enjoyed the author's personal, conversational style of writing. The pictures and text describe the postures very well, and the author is good at stressing that one should work within their limitations. I don't think anyone should buy this thinking that they will be able to practice ashtanga on their own at home, without any outside instruction. Maybe you would do alright if you were already familiar with basic yoga postures; even then the vinyasa (the linking or ""flow"" postures) is still very difficult, and, in my opinion, impossible to do without ""live"" instruction. The book probably works best as an adjunct to classes."
2,Not the best yoga book,I did not like this type of Yoga. I felt that it was not a beginners book as well. It is not easy to read and the poses are too advanced. I bought this book for a college Yoga class and I didn't like the class either!
5,Still use this after nearly 10 years!,"I was given this book nearly 10 years ago, in college, when going to a yoga class was finacially out of the question. Even with all of the DVD's that are out there now, I will still go back to this book for reference often. A person just needs to remember to take this book in stride, you do what you can, and work into what you can't do."
4,"A complete, and very good, Yoga program.","I do the Basic postures described in this book almost every day. I have done so for over a year and find it very satisfying.The book describes the postures well, and the pictures give you a good idea of what you're doing. Sometimes it gets a little confusing, but if you work through it, you can figure it out. I also like Birch's other comments on Yoga practice in general. The postures cover a wide range of skill levels, from basic to challenging."
5,Skinmedica moisturizer,"Loves this product, light weight and works great with the TNS serum. Good purchase and cheaper here than at the Dr. office."
2,Not so great!,This product was said to be good for high temp foods to refrig. This product does not keep a good seal. ok to use as a temporary cover but not good for storage.
4,As Fun As The Movie,"""Surf's Up"" was a surprisingly great movie and my daughters and I loved it. Typically, games based on movies (especially animated features) can be really lame. Fortunately, this one is as terrific as the movie, and a whole lot of fun! It's easy enough that my 7 year old picked up most of the controls right away. But it's got enough challenges and unlockable characters, boards, environments etc. that we're still playing it and finding it exciting weeks after we first got it. I would say that this is not only how a movie game should be done, it's how all games should be done. A great game all around. ""A+"""
1,"Good show, terrible video",The video on this blu-ray is a joke. First three seasons are in 4:3 format so you're watching only half of your tv screen. Save your money if you bought the dvd.
4,"One of the better SciFi shows I have seen in awhile,","I did not see the series when it was on TV, but being able to buy the full series I hadto jump at the deal ( I had heard allot of good word of mouth from friends )the CGI is primitive but for a show that came out 1999 there ok. The best part isthe aliens and creature work from The Jim Henson Company. They did a great job andthere is something to be said about there work the for me that beats out most CGI.If your a fan shows like Stargate SG1/Atlantis/universe, you should check this show out."
5,"Finally , back in print.","I am so pleased that FARSCAPE has finally come out again on DVD. I first saw season 4 out at ***-mart and purchased it. Inside the package was a leaflet showing a Henson.com address. This is where I purchased the complete series from. Very, Very reasonable prices!!! Also bought The Peacekeeper Wars at the same time. All the Disks work perfectly in my Toshiba Recorder. The Four Seasons come packaged individually along with an Archive Set, that all come packed together in a cardboard casing.I give this box set a 5 star thumbs up."
5,Best series,"I would recommend this series for anyone who love science fiction, fantasy, and action. This series has an excellent story line and characters that have a lot of dynamics that keep you wanting more."
5,An awesome show,"I just bought this set because the original seperate series sets i had before got divorce relocated. I just have to say that this is one of the best shows i have ever seen. The level and amount of work that went into this series is astronomical, and it shows. I hope that at some point this series finds a home and picks back up with ben and claudia and the gang at it again. I think this set is well worth the purchasing and anyone who has half a sci fi wishbone in their body will thoroughly enjoy this show that has found a way to meld drama, romance, comedy, epic, and science fiction all into one extreme package."
4,"Awesome show, but the box set could have been done better.","The Farscape series is really good. There are times when its all taken a little to seriously, but when the cast is having fun with the script you can tell and you in turn have fun too. The only problem I have with this box set is that the episodes are not in order on the disks. I did not realize this until I got to the season two disks. The first episode of season two is the last episode on the second disk. So you actually have to do some work to watch all the episodes in the correct order. Luckily the list of episodes are on the Jim Henson website. The extras are incredible and the archives disks are full of stuff most have never seen before. Enjoy it, but do a little reading before you just hit ""play all."""
4,Aussie SiFi,a very different take on SiFi themes got a little off in season 3 but better than not a home run but a respectable double
2,Would be more appropriately named Space Muppets,I read reviews comparing this to Star Trek and Firefly... no idea what those people were drinking or smoking but apparently I missed out.Two stars only because I can ditch this off on a 13 year old nephew.
4,"Awesome! ...would have been 5 stars, but could not get closed captioning","Box says closed captioned, but I could not get it to work. Tried 3 different TV's, thru a playstation, thru DVD player, checked all settings on DVD, TV's and players ...could not get it. Aside from that aggrivation, the show is awesome! Me and my husband loved them, but you have to watch The Peacekeeper Wars to get an ending."
5,Farscape--the complete series,"Farscape has been my favorite TV show since I was 13 years old and I'm now 23. After not watching Farscape for a few years after the Peacekeeper Wars and then receiving and watching this set, I fell in love with it all over again. I previously owned all four seasons in bulky packaging. This new set is nice and slim and doesn't take up much room on my shelf. The extras vary from what I consider to be a bit on the boring side to very entertaining and funny. I especially enjoy the episode commentary. The price is also very reasonable and affordable, considering it's one fourth of what paid for the other set I owned. A must have for any Farscape fan!"
3,More subtitles,"HBO back in late 90's started to show this awesome series in Latin America and SUBTITLED!!!! How in the world could the producers of the DVDs not attach more subtitles onto this production? The series was highly reviewed and despite been canceled abruptly, it was strongly followed by the Latin America Sci-Fi community!!!! I believe this is an outrageous production!! 3 stars because it's still an awesome Sci-Fi production but with a lack of subtitles for other people out side USA."
2,"Love FarScape, HATE the QUALITY of REPRODUCTION!","I've enjoyed FarScape thoroughly through the years it was playing, so I decided to share this series with a good friend. We sat down to watch it, and the lack of quality was evident immediately -- and this on BluRay! I'm afraid to think of what it was like on DVD! (Heard the DVD version doesn't have subtitles. The BR version's subtitles are ... clumsy, with typos, oversized print in the way of the image... If this wasn't coming from Amazon, I'd have accused it of being a well-packaged bootleg!I've returned it and strongly recommend that you save yourself the annoyance. The show was awesome. These reproductions are horrible. The quality was FAR better when it was airing originally, on CRT TV!Yes, the quality ruins it. It's hard to enjoy it when it's coming off out of focus and pixelating, when subtitles have misspelled words, etc. Shame they couldn't even manage to transfer it to disk properly. For the price, I'm sure they could."
4,Thank you A&E!!!,"Finally after years of waiting, we are able to get Farscape without having to pay an arm or a leg.I never saw the series while on t.v., but I did catch ""The PeaceKeeper Wars"" when it came to dvd. I have been looking forward to this day for a long, long, time. Was it worth it? You bet! The transfer of the video is nice and clean, my only gripe technically is that the volume seems a bit low. I wish that dvd makers would insist on a regular setting for volume instead of some being very low to very high.Amazon said it would take two to four weeks to ship this, I recieved it with in one. Thanks!"
3,"Not ideal, but all there is","If you are interested in Arthur Sullivan's Music without Gilbert, this is one of the works you should have in your collection. Unfortunately the quality of the performance is inconsistent. The orchestra is at times good, at others sloppy. The soloists are also of varying quality. This is, after all, a recording by a semi-professional group. That said, if you are willing to accept the flaws, this is currently the only version on disc. Perhaps someday the BBC will record a version, as they did with Sullivan's ""Rose of Persia"". In the current recording, the most pleasing selections are: The Act 3 Scene 2 ensemble ""Look where thy moody father walks apart"", Friar Tuck's rollicking ""Ho, Jolly Jenkin"", The Templar's passionate scene ""Woo thou thy snowflake"", and Rebecca's evocative aria ""Lord of our chosen race"". Not all it could be, but it's all we've got."
2,Is it easier??,"This software is interesting yet not intuitive when you first learn it. I am having some problems with it. After entering many family favorites this sodfteware crashed and now all I have is error messages. Some of the preprogramed ingredients are difficult to use and I have to enter a dash before the entry to not have the preprogrammed entry override my entry. A problem. At this point, would not recommend this software. Too many problems."
4,"Good fit, clarity could be better","Goggles fit great and don't pull on any of my eye areas which is great. The clarity of the lens isn't great. While it doesn't fog up, it holds on to drops of water in various places."
5,water tight & comfortable,Purchased based on other reviews. I wear when also wearing contacts. No leakage and very comfortable. No need to adjust for an hour of swimming.
5,"comfortable watertight fit, excellent breadth of vision","I have been a fitness swimmer for many years and have tried a variety of goggles, some of them fairly expensive. I have been using this Aqua Sphere model for three months now and find it excellent -- much better range of vision than the mass-distributed brands, comfortable to wear, and rarely leak (which was a problem for me with the big name brands). They are a few dollars more than the widely distributed ones and worth every penny. How well a particular goggle fits depends upon the size and shape of ones face. For me, these are terrific!"
5,Very good googles!,All I have to say is WOW! I have a very high nose bridge and it is difficult to find goggles/glasses that fit. I usually don't buy them online because they usually don't fit. They are very confortable and easy to adjust. I higly recommend this product!
2,"Very comfortable, great open view, but these leak swimming at medium speeds","I was trying to switch over from the standard Speedo line of goggles (Vanquisher 2 was my norm), looking for a change plus clear goggles for the lap pool. They arrived, and have one pro and two cons.PRO: very clear, comfortable fitCON: The strap tightening system isn't as secure as I expect.CON: Once I started swimming, medium speed, one of the goggles always leaked. I tried tightening the straps, but then they straps just came undone because they were too tight.I'm going back to Vanquisher 2s, they have perfect seal and better strap."
4,"Very Good, would buy more if needed them","These fit around my face very well and are pretty easy to adjust, they are not too tight. The fit is good and fogging is minimal so far.I use soap when fogging occurs; just wash with a little soap on the inside of lens and wipe excess off, leaving some residue."
5,I can see clearly now....,"Wearing these goggles underwater, I can see clearly. They adjust easily, and fit snugly on my eyes, so I even feel comfortable wearing my contact lens while I'm swimming. I got a few pair, so even my kids can wear them -- they are that easy to adjust. The view is so clear, I have to remind myself not to breath while diving!"
1,Useless,I have worn these goggles several times now and no matter how I adjust them they leak continuously. DO NOT BUY THEY ARE A WASTE OF MONEY
3,Not bad,"Looks nice, is comfortable, and you can see really well underwater. However, it will fog up after doing laps in the pool. Basically, you'll still need some anti-fogging agent."
1,It broke in the first time when adjusting it,The side handle broke when I first tried to adjust. I bought because of the quality and I'm upset because quality decreased A LOT. Now I want to return it but I live in Brazil. How can we manage it?
5,The Perfect Goggle,"These were recommended to me by another Master's swimmer. I absolutely LOVE them. They fit perfectly. I have a very narrow face and the bridge of my nose is a bit off center, so fitting goggles is tough for me. I think these would fit a narrow or a wide face.They are so comfortable, they are the only goggle that doesn't ache after a one hour workout! They also have a wide field of vision, yet are low profile. I would definitely recommend them."
5,Awesome,"flawless from what I can tell, I am no seasoned swimmer, however I do laps from time to time and these have zero leakage, are comfortable, and look a bit bad a@$ if you know what I mean."
2,It leaks...,"It great fit but leak. I must maintain it very tight and it really hurt me. Anyway, I still could adjust again and again in my swimming. I'm too lazy to replace it."
2,0 for the CD sleeves - 5 for the music,No real need to go into details about the music here other than to say that the tunes are great. The book that comes with the set is fab. The super tight built-in sleeves that house the CDs are THE WORST CONTRAPTIONS OF ALL TIME. Two of my CDs were scratched at purchase. What the heck was Rhino thinking?
3,"Dominance, submission, and more","The late Preston attempted several things in these novels: to describe, with love and enthusiasm, his world of gay male S & M, to turn the reader on, to foster self-respect among the many participants, and to promote in a very sensible way the use of condoms. He succeeds in all of the above. There isn't much real character development, but that likely wasn't one of Preston's goals. You get to know the guys about as well as you would if you'd spent a bit of time (and no more) together. A slightly disguised Anne Rice, in real life a beloved friend of the author, appears in one of the novels as ""Adrienne."""
1,way off base..unnecessary sex...the others are A+,Keep Bernie & Carolyn in New York! Letice being there was too coincidental and her cutting that bridge cable made no sense.This is my alltime favorite series...I guess even burglers can bungle.
3,It's not one of his better Bernies',having read and loving all of the rhodenbar escapades i was alittle let down esp. after rhe long wait since his last escapade.
1,Simply INcredible,"This book deserves 5 stars for bias and no stars for truth. It not only distorts the facts, it is a downright litany of unfair misrepresentations. For example, when the author quotes and then proceeds to legitimize Benito Mussolini's (of all balanced world leaders!) calling Vladimir Jabotinsky a ""fascist,"" something must be inverted in his thinking. Jabotinisky was a talented journalist and deep thinker. The author, in a frighteningly messianic tone, describes Ben-Gurion, who, in truth, was a career politician, who ruthlessly eradicated his opponents to become Israel's first Prime Minsiter. In addition to the many misspellings of foreign names and a haunting sense of unchecked facts, this book was a disappointment, to say the least."
5,Dutty,"this album is off tha rip. it shows that the south really has flow.i reccomend that everyone goes out and buys this one and shows them dirty boys tha love that they deserve.after you cop it spread the word so that this hits platnium status and the magazines, bet and mtv cant help but give dirty props"
4,PIMP AND THA GANGSTA IS A MUST THIS ONE IS STILL GOOD THOUGH,JUST PUT THIS ONE IN YOUR DIRTY SOUTH COLLECTION
2,"Disappointed . . . I've always liked Pampers products, but not these.","We got these to help with potty training, but they are no where as good as the Huggies equivalents. You pull these on and pull them off, so if your kid has shoes on, has an accident; you have to completely undress the lower half to change him/her. This is terrible if you're out somewhere. The Huggies have velcro sides, so you can replace a pair without removing all the clothes."
1,season one sucks,"man is season one not funny in the slightest. at least they got it together for season 2 with some good skits. also every music act on the first two seasons is pitifully bad.don't believe the hype, season1 blows."
5,Best Show On TV,This is the best show on TV period. I plan on buying all seasons. Antonio is a hater.
3,some funny but other's are not.,"some of the sketches are funny, but others just fall flat in the worst way."
5,Outstanding!!!!,i remember watching the series premiere of chappelle's show and i felt the same way when i watched it again after receiving it from Amazon. its an amazing season and an amazing show. i highly recommend it to all!!
5,"Musicalgenius, go back under the rock you came from","Dave Chappelle is one of the funniest comics out right now. He isn't afraid to make light of the problems that we are dealing with in this country at this moment (politics, racism, etc), and put his own little spin on them. If so many people thought they should ""watch the 700 club instead"", it would not be the 2nd highest rated show on Comedy Central behind South Park! He was brought back for a second season for a reason--he's hilarious! My favorites are the Charlie Murphy's true Hollywood stories (I'm Rick James b**ch!) and the blind KKK member who's actually black. The R Kelly skit was freakin genius. The one thing the DVD does not have is the musical appearances from the show, but the DVD is great anyway. All the uncensored skits are even better with the cursing! This definitely a must have!P.S. Musicalgenius, Dave uses the ""N"" word jokingly in his skits...which way did you use it in your review??"
4,Very Happy,"After seeing a Consumer Report guide about knives I noticed this set in the Top 10 among the 200-400 dollar knife sets. It was selected as a best buy and I bought them. They are fantastic and although they are not as quality as a 400 dollar set, you will barely notice the difference."
3,No for someone who spends a lot of time in the kitchen,"I received this set in 2008 as a housewarming/xmas gift from my brother and his wife. These knives are a decent value and are great for someone getting their first place and building their set of kitchen tools. They hold an edge fairly well, the handles are comfortable, and the full set provides a lot of function for around $50. On the bad side these are very light and the blades are very thin. One of the steak knives in my set now has a bent tip from sliding off someone's plate and onto a wood floor. The stainless steel is also a poor grade and will rust if not washed and dried properly. Overall good for a beginner, but someone who likes to cook a lot or prefers quality cookware will want to upgrade from these."
1,Disappointed,Product was returned. Item made in China and not indicated in the offer. This was at one time a domestic product.
1,no switching capability,"Purchased this 12 v solenoid switch from Amazon. Product was received quickly and in good condition. The product description was for a winch but the picture was for the solenoid switch for a 12 v winch. So I risked the order.What was received was exactly as pictured. Tried to use the solenoid as a switch to control a 12V motor, and it would not turn the 12V power on or off for a 12V bulb indicating that the switch was defective. Tried it with a larger load, still no functionReturned the switch using Amazon's excellent service."
3,"It is labeled Verizon, not Plantronics","I was surprised to see the Verizon logo on it. I googled the model number that was on it, but it was not found as any kind of Verizon product.It looks similar, but we're talking about a simple device. The rubbery part is a different color than what is in the picture, too.It is working fine so far.If it weren't for the hassle of returning it, I would have, just because I am partial to Plantronics."
4,"UNIQUE ,GREAT ART BOOK",this book is very unique as it is all fictional animals of a fictional place.the art is really good and worth getting the book alone...i really thought it was very well done and goes into fairly deep detail about the whole island......thought it should have had a few more mammals though..
2,Nioxin for fine hair,I didn't notice any difference in my hair as far as fullness. My hair is baby fine. Not much out there to help us fine haired folks.
3,Profit Building - Cutting Cost Without Cutting People,"If you are looking for a way to increase profits in your organization, I strongly recommend that you start by first reading Profit Building - Cutting Costs Without Cutting People. Mr. Ludy takes you step by step though the process of building an on-going profit build team for your organization. We have used it as a blueprint for our company and it has really turned our employees. The book moves fast and I found it to be an easy read."
1,never worked,"This unit was tripping off intermittently right out of the box, even though it was only connected to a Mac, monitor and a few other low-drain items (small computer speakers,e.g.). We finally took it off. I was going to return it but let it sit for a few months, then tried again with a single Mac, nothing else, not even the monitor. Still tripped. Plus, it gave off an ozone-like smell that made me wonder. Now it's just past warrantee, natch, and in any event the cost to ship back such a heavy item probably isn't worth it. We're using an APC UPS now. I'm avoiding Tripp-Lite in the future and certainly wouldn't recommend this model."
4,Worked as described,"Had my first chance to try it out last night. Our power went out and the battery lasted long enough to shut it down. Even when using a 32""LCD tv as the monitor"
2,Shame on me...,"It was the cheapest unit of this capacity that i was willing to try. (Student = budget is tight...) I bought it for my modem and router.Seem to work fine when power drops, but don't know how long it will keep the loads going.When i bought it, i neglected to note that it doesn't have a user-replaceable battery, or a computer data link. In this day and age, i just expected it to have both, as units $15 more expensive have... So, the battery setup is just environmentally irresponsible. And the lack of a data link means it's only good for short power outages, if used to power a computer. Otherwise, at this VA capacity, it will just allow the computer to crash 5-10 minutes later than without power backup...SO, shame on me for buying this unit, and on Tripp-Lite for putting its fine name on it... I just didn't have any spare money for something better..."

5,At A Loss for Words-DVD,This is a 30 minute DVD and it is from people who have experienced actual loss. The interviews are eye opening. Everyone should watch it. It tells the feelings of parents that need your support not your comments.
5,An Excellent Overview,I started reading this when i thought my depression was maybe manic-depression. It turns out soon after I ended up in a severe hypomanic state and was admitted to the hospital. This is an invaluable resource to me and provides information in a clear and concise manner. I highly recommend it.
