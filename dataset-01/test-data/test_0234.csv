3,Wedding Crashers - Uncorked (Unrated Full Screen Edition),"Wedding Crashers - Uncorked (Unrated Full Screen Edition)Funny, not much more."
5,Freaking Funny,"After being dissappoint by ""Dodgeball"" and ""Anchorman"" (they were funny, but not that funny) I went into ""Crashers"" expecting the same. I was pleasantly surprised as not only was this one of the funniest movies of the year, but one of the funniest I've ever seen. This is a must have, especially for those who are fans of Vaughn and Wilson. Walken and McAdams also deliever grat preformances. Buy this right now!"
1,"the movie that changes ""i do"" to ""i don't""","wow, what a disappointment. i happen to really loathe that predictable predicament when the ""hero"" has lied to a woman, has been caught in his own web of deciet and looses the woman before he really gets her and now the poor boy is wallowing in the misery of his own making.and horror of horrors, he makes his yes-i-am-a-liar-but-now-i'm-telling-the-truth-and-i-love-you-confession in the middle of his best friend's wedding. to be fair, i think wedding crashers is the best this horrible formula can do. lots of people laughing so many might enjoy this. but many people also put campbells mushroom soup in every recipe. and that's the casserole you get here."
1,"1 of the most over rated, unapologetic rip-off of other comedies ever!","Everything in this movie's been done before, and better. There's nothing original aside from the premise. And the ""funny"" scenes are no funnier than ""hits to the groin"" jokes in cartoons and Super Bowl commercials. This movie has focus group written all over it, with unoriginal characters aimed at various demographics to reel in mega-bucks at the theater. And in that it worked. Otherwise, everything from this movie reeks of relatively recent movies like ""Meet the Parents"" or ""The Wedding Singer,"" to name only a couple. I had only chuckles of contempt throughout this load of crap and find it hard to believe anyone with half a memory, much less brain really found it funny. Oh well, one man's pleasure is another man's pain. But don't buy into the hype. Years from now, in hindsight of comparison to other movies, I believe folks who once found it funny will be asking themselves, ""What the hell were we laughing at?"""
3,More Like Decent Chick Flick,"Yes, this movie had funny stuff in it - but it ain't Old School, despite the fact they try and sell it like it is. IN fact, I couldn't help but feel by the end of the movie, I had been duped into watching a chick flick, that had been retro-fitted with some yucks that would appeal to the guys, so they'd go see the thing..."
5,Wedding Crashers (Unrated),Great movie! Lots of laughs and sweet moments. Definitely worth purchasing this movie. I watch it over and over again.
4,thumbs up! a real hoot,"a must for any bachelor to see alsorts of laughs & giggles in this one,I would put it next to What about Mary class!!! all around a B- rate"
1,A movie for dullards,"I read great reviews for this movie and was completely disappointed. This plot is barely worthy of a 22-minute sitcom. There are two funny scenes, otherwise wrapped in wholly predictable tripe. Not sophisticated, not good slapstick. It just lands with a thud like just so much unprocessed sewage."
2,"Sorry, just not that funny","Most seemed to think this was ""hilarious."" I'm mystified. I never laughed once. What's wrong with me? I mean, this isn't even the slightest bit funny. To me. Probably not to Owen Wilson either, since he attempted suicide after filming it. The extra of the first preview audience howling at the football scene is beyond my comprehension. Must have been group think, or mindwashing. It's also at least 15-20 mins too long. Boys get girls in the end. Are you surprised? Are you belly laughing?"
2,"Don't bother, you'll be fine without it.",An utter display of horrid acting by Vaughn. Such a crappy film. I won't utter another word about this forgettable film. A pure waste of currency.
1,Wedding Crashers,This is the most filthy movie. I am destroying the dvd. I won't even share it(which I usually do)with my 40's daughter and son in law. I cannot believe such filth is being shown at a public movie theater.
2,A joke is funny only once,This movie seems to turn in cirles. The first wedding is still funny but seeing the same joke over and over again gets boring. The scene pretty much repeats itself for 90 minutes.
3,"IT'S ONLY ME, BUT:",NOT MU CUP OF TEA. DON'T LIKE VINCE VAUGN. TO IMMATURE IDIOT GUS ON THE PROWL. OWEN WILSON CUTENESS IS NOT ENOUGH TO CARRY THE SHOW. JM
4,"Pretty good, but just sort of ends","If you have any interest in the handheld industry, this book gives an interesting look at its history. It is mainly about Jeff Hawkins and Donna Dubinsky, the main founders of Palm. It treats them a little reverently - they seemingly do no wrong. But leaving that aside it is a good story of start up and the struggles it goes through as they eventually leave to found Hanspring. The only other negative is that the book just kind of ends at the beginning of this year (2002) and the future is so uncertain. Will Handspring's Treo product be like the original palm in the it completely takes over the market? Maybe the authors should have waited a year to the history is a little clearer."
5,This cd is bangin!!,"Definately the best one Kurupt has came with so far. His albums just keep getting better and better. When I first heard the cd I started listening to the second track on this album, ""Space Boogie"", and I already knew how bangin this whole cd was gonna be. After listening to the whole album I would have to say that Kurupt is definately one of the tightest mc's out right now if not the tightest."
4,Kruption,This album is O.K Beats Lyrics are ok 1 star for guest apperingsthe other 3 stars are for the whole album.Nice Album
4,Anotha load,"I gotta say...the king pin has done it again. I think this is the tighest out of the 3 albums he dropped. It's pretty much universal. He got that melodic joint(it's over now) for the younger ones; the R-n-B laid back track(Sunshine)for something to munch on; classic DPG sound... to that straight gangstarism(The Hardest). It's almost flawless...if only that country singer wasn't on one of the ""songs""(I'd rather had Kokane or 1/2 Dead or Nate on that literally Kurupted track); only if Dogg father and Dillinger together in one cut; and only if he did one of those battle rhymes again responding to X's ""murder tears"". It's Dre-less catchy beats, but...with the rapid,constant flow and the organ riffs of track#7(dopest head noddin' track), the album surely is ""on site"". Quik,Wreck and Lehtal really did their job. Can't wait for their DPG 2002. Hopefully, it'll be like a reunion album with more cameo's from the ""W"". Big up to the Young Gotti...Aloha from the 808!!"
4,This game's awesome..,Quality and graphic's are very much fair..Fast shipping as well..i got this game in less than two weeks..usually i recieved my orders in about a month.lol
5,"Finally, a book that tells the truth","I have always been skeptical of the inordinate amount of emphasis that's been placed on the whiz bang aspect of computers. The Flickering Mind, with clear and well researched prose, explains why computers don't teach my kids to think in ways that will ultimately help them in the big, bad world. Let's use Oppenheimer's book as a platform from which rethink the way we're emphasizing computers in the schools!"
4,John Wayne Story - The Later Years,This is a great companion for the Early Years DVD I enjoyed it immensly I Duke collection would not be complete without this one too.
5,AWESOME Worship CD!,"I love this CD! I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for good, uplifting worship music. I bought it mainly for the track ""You Are My All In All"" but they're all good!"
2,2 Stars...One for each good track on here,"It stinks that I have to give this such a low rating, but the remixes on this single suffer from a serious lack of likeability...the radio edit and the original mix are the only two tracks on here worth owning. I was not impressed by the slow moving near lifeless Sergio Santiago mix, nor the trying-to-hard to make nothing happen tracks from Solid Groove...so long as you are just buying this for the originals, you won't be disappointed...They are great! However, if you are looking for some good remixes of this track...keep on looking because they aren't on this one."
4,About the Human Side of War,"A refreshing film about how people are still people during war, with hopes and dreams and holiday traditions, whether ally or foe."
2,honestly? Very Average,"Cheap production values, average filming, average actors...I bought it, I will sell it, really do not bother..."
2,"Excellent Cast, Disappointing Story",Excellent performances by strong ensemble cast. Heavy-handed moralizing hurt this film. Technical military flaws also detract from the story but not the performances. 2 stars only.
1,Horrible...a travesty,"Oh please. If you're going to make a movie out of an amazing book, please do it right! If you want to buy this video, be warned...the book is 100 times better. Buy it. Read it. Fall in love with it. And by the way, Gary Senise made a horrible Mother."
3,"Good movie, bad copy","Movie itself is good. Only problem is its advertised as widescreen, but shown in ""pan & scan"" cutting out most of picture. Korean import."
4,"Repetitive, yes, but a good ending to the series","Having called this a good ending to the series, allow me to elaborate. I was expecting a big blowout. Instead, it kind of petered out, as if it ran out of steam. However, it is more realistic this way - a lot of wars peter out when the combatants are tired of fighting. And it served as a useful setup for the Colonisation series.The major gripe is the same as I've had with the other books in the series - too repetitive! I guess this is useful if you had to wait a year between installments, but surely if you've read all the 3 previous books, you realise by now that the Race has a long history, that they can't mate without female scent pheremones, that Earth is colder than Home, etc. Still, an entertaining end to an entertaining series. I will definitely pick up this alternate history in Colonisation."
3,"ho-hum climax, one sided, strategy????","first three books 'assumed' a interesting, but fell short, ending. reptile-like alien leaves a limited imagination. may purchase 4th volume at a flea market. other three volumes gets a pushed 4.5 stars (reptileform gotta go. purchase 4th book just to complete series."
2,Thank goodness it's over!,"I usually start a series with misgivings. This series reminded me why. Like many or indeed most multi-book series, it has enough content for a single novel but either due to a crumbling editor, a greedy publisher and or author it was published as is. There are very few multi volume novels that deserved to be delivered as such. This one should have been delivered in one book. The premise is original and promishing. The delivery is very very repetitive repetitive. Did I say it was repetitive? If you like the central core (alien culture battles earth) read Footfall by Larry Niven. It's only around 650 pages long. And MUCH better.David M. Rya"
5,"""An exiting, surprising finish to a top notch series""","It may not be the typical ending of an alien invasion of Earth story, but that's why it worked for me. It was a nice finish to one of the most brilliant sagas I have ever read. Turtledove did an outstanding job capturing the global scope of the conflict through the eyes of some very unique individuals. His portrayal of The Race was one of the best I have ever seen of an alien species. If I do have complaints about the series, it's that General Patton and ""Wild Bill"" Donovan should have been used for more than cameo roles. I also would have loved to have seen Field Marshall Rommel and General MacArthur play roles in the series. But I guess you can't have everything. With the ending Turtledove had, there is the possiblity for a sequel. I hope that becomes a reality . . . and soon."
3,Decent ending to the first half of this marathon series,"There is a lot of repetition in these books, and by the fourth book, there is no doubt that it subtracts from the overall quality for those of us who have been following the series all along. It is almost like the oldtime Flash Gordon serials, because at the beginning of each new episode, you have to go thru a recap of the last few episodes, otherwise newcomers would be somewhat lost.I give this fourth book in the series 3.5 stars (rounded down to 3), as there just isn't enough unique material in this fourth book.A lot more of the main characters get bumped off in this book, and two of them happened to have been my favorites - but, this is a book about a deadly war, and if characters weren't dying off, it wouldn't be believable.I'm now moving on to the 2nd part of this Marathon series, with COLONIZATION: SECOND CONTACT. I'm hoping to find some new favorite characters."
4,"Yet again, it's us versus THEM","Not a bad book, although it's starting to get a little far-fetched as the series leaves us on a cliffhanger waiting for the fifth book. The aliens' psych is the weakest link in believability. If they're really as slow to adapt to new situations and ideals as Turtledove portrays them to be, then they wouldn't be able to make any sort of a match for humans in combat. Despite some of the logical shortcomings in the series, it is pretty good pulp. If it doesn't end by the fifth book, though, I'm gonna give up hope of finishing the series."
2,What a disapointment.,"Having read the last three books (couldn't find the first) I kept expecting it to get better. It didn't. It was an excelent idea but are all Germans really evil? Are all English and Americans really good? There were so many subplots it was hard to keep track of what was going on. Each subplot was mentioned in each chapter and many had nothing to do with the main plot. Made you wonder why they were written other that to just fill paper.Turtledove missed a good opportunity here to write a classic science fiction novel. He would have been better off to mention his idea to someone else and let them write a 600 page novel than meander through 2400 pages himself.Yup, still read three of the four books and he is spending the royalies he made off me!"
1,Audio CD Version,"Sunset and Sawdust is a great book. The narrator, though, is not consistent with keeping her ""voices"" straight. I wish she'd just read it as her voice and accent are great."
4,Found a Hit!,"He's just a dishwasher that dj's on the weekends who just measured out all the details of the stereo components' placement in our den and left the receiver tuned to ""his favorite"" channel whose best way of telling me what I needed to hear at this time of the night after the weekend we just shared, after getting his voice mail message instead of being there to hear him telling me that he chose to keep a difficult promise instead of what he has the ""right"" to do, I powered up the new hook up and heard him tell me what this song had to say. If he hears this song and album it will confirm to him that I got the message of his heart some how. Going to buy him a copy tomorrow."
3,Okay for the money....,"I'm satisfied, but not as happy with the watch as I thought I would be. The watch is nice. My only gripe is that the strap/band is a bit long (and I, by no means, have a skinny wrist). I was surprised at how long the band is AND IT STRETCHES A BIT after you wear it. I'm on the last hole, so if it stretches any more....I WON'T BE ABLE TO WEAR IT. I don't use it daily, so am still unsure on how much more it will stretch."
3,A great reference,"I found other books on TA to be more useful for reading straight through and overcoming the learning curve on TA (e.g. Technical Analysis Explained, Martin Pring *****).Although, because this book contains so much information, it is a great reference to have in your library. You will find yourself looking for more information on topics that other books don't cover in a lot of depth, so it is important to have a few good reference books.It also contains sections on developing strategies which some may find useful, although, ""THE"" single best resource on developing a strategy is Schwager's Market Wizards series (5x*)."
4,Very good but buy the updated version,"I walked the Camino in May 2005. This was a very helpful book, but it did not reflect the many changes since it was published in 2003. There is an updated 2005 version that is supposed to be even lighter weight. I really enjoyed Brierley's insights that went beyond the practical journey. The next time I walk it I will take his updated version."
4,Can Sabrina stop Harvey from falling for Jenny?,"I love this book! Why? Because it's unique and you can't predict the ending!When an exchange student moves into Westbridge,the whole school goes wacko. Harvey wants to go to the Valentine's Day dance with Jenny instead of Sabrina.Quentin Pid (exchange student from Greece) is falling for Sabrina, and Libby is madly in love with the class geek. Sabrina knows something's up when suddenly,her magic won't work on Quentin.Is the school under a love spell? Sabrina just can't figure it out."
5,PARAGONS OF MODERN ROCK TOY AROUND,"Literally. Even manned with merely cache of toy instruments, Self sounds as great as ever; and vastly blows away any Top 40 artists' musicianship in the process. Rest assured it won't take too many listens to this album to get utterly addicted & have its pop hooks flying around your brain @ all hours of the day & night. I was admittedly sketchy about the toy instrument concept album, but if I didn't know this fact, I probably couldn't tell because it comes off so flawlessly & superbly. Self is one of the most underappreciated bands around today. And on a level of pure selfishness [no pun intended], I hope they stay that way because I'm not sure I really want to share them with the rest of world like I had to with They Might Be Giants and other lesser-knowns; Still, I wouldn't outright object to Self egressing beyond indie fares & severely underpromoted big label albums... SO GO AHEAD & BUY THIS ALBUM ALREADY!"
2,"A good gimmick, but a gimmick nonetheless","This album was created entirely with toy instruments, from plastic guitars to Speak'n'Spells, so it's an accomplishment of sorts. Unfortunately the songwriting of Self mainman Matt Mahaffey is still too cute by half, with each song pinballing between too many ideas like case studies in the debilitating effects of Attention Deficit Disorder. Only ""Trunk Fulla Amps"" comes close to being a fully realized song, and all the slick studio trickery eventually undercuts the impact of the toy instrument conceit. By the time Mahaffey settles in to the world's most annoying version of the Doobie Brothers' most annoying song (""What a Fool Believes"") the accomplishment of Gizmodgery has devolved into mere gimmickry."
1,Questionable!,"from a christian Stand point, I don't think this movie was any different than a secular movie. Carmen playing a preacher in the movie- praising God one minute, then kissing some woman the next minute was not very edifying. Furthermore; if I want to see wild parties with women dancing on top of tables I can go rent a secular movie. I can understand them trying to portray the life of some boxer, but the scene was unnecessary.I really do think that there should be a distinction between christian movies and secular movies, and not just us praying and calling out the name of Jesus in a movie.(with all do respect)It had a good plot, but that's it.Carmen is a strong figure to a lot of people and I don't think that he represented himself that way in this movie."
5,Carman The Champion,"If you haven't seen this movie, you are really missing out on some good entertainment for your entire family. The best thing about this movie (and there are many good things) is that it gets better and better every time you watch it. This is not a movie that you watch once and never watch again. Really worth your money to purchase this one. Please do yourself a favor and your family and buy this movie and play it more than once (or twice). You will learn and see things each time that will heighten the movie's excitement and message of faith.If you aren't a Carman fan to begin with, this movie should surely make you one. If you are a Carman fan and saw the movie or own the movie, please buy another for a friend (or someone) so they too can be touch by this faith filled, spirit uplifting, movie."
4,Not exactly as shown in the photo.,"But, of course, this happens when one orders the Plus Sizes.Good quality and fit is true to size. Arrived in a timely fashion."
4,"Great book, terrible editing","Bill Shapiro is an author whose work I will look forward to in the future. This is a great story, written in a great style, combining horror and science fiction. The characters are real, the plot is made believable, but something is amiss.....Mr. Shapiro needs to find a new proof reader!!! There were so many typographical/grammar errors, that I ended up reading many things twice just to extract the intended meaning!!!I would loved to have given this book five stars. However, the book is tough to get through with all of the errors. Enjoy the book as best you can, in its current state!"
2,Very Classical Sounding,I purchased this CD for the purpose of bellydancing. The CD is very classical and relaxing not motivating whatsoever. If you like classical music this CD is for you.
2,disappointed,"It wasn't what I expected. I was looking for gypsy music found in movies, travel or more moving and haunting refrains usually found in background music, back streets, markets. culturally alive and emotionally connecting to ones sense of 'Old World' charm.'"
4,a quick but enjoyable read,"I was able to read _A coldness in the blood_ in one 3.5-hour sitting... it's a bit formulaic, but is more consistently written than some of Saberhagen's other Dracula books, which I feel suffer from bad editing. the story timeline is kept in the modern day without a parallel historical fiction accompanying it. I enjoyed the read immensely; the pace was consistent and the descriptions tight. I think the biggest drawback is that it so persistently refers back to all the prior books in the series that I sometimes felt I was reading a sales pitch. the backreferences are funny, in some cases better written than the books to which he referred."
4,Not just another chick singer...,"Ms. White's New York CD release is missing just one thing - fame. Her voice reaches into my soul and jerks my heart open - pure talent at it's finest. She shows just how rock should sound with ""Take Me Down"", a rock song to the Nth degree. ""Take Me..."" spares no mercy with musicianship or her fabulous vocal ability. Some sing from the throat, some the diaphram... Ms. White's voice rips free from a tiger that pounces and rips the listener with rasp, raw, and power. A beat that makes me wanna shake, oh yeah! It's on 'repeat' - I can't play it too many times!I recommend this album for anyone considering buying music that will knock their socks off. Melissa who? No contest, 'Gadget' takes the nomination!Thank you 'Gadget' for crafting truly kick ass listening enjoyment. Good luck in your future endeavors.Rat McGee, Austin Texas, fratmcgee@hotmail.com"
5,bada bing!,"I waited sleeplessly for this treasured gem to arrive. Not even the 1980s 'intro to German language' class on the local public broadcast and a nonstop swill of temperanillo could soothe my nerves. But alas, it is now firmly entrenched in my steel grip. Til death do us part? Hah! Posh! They are going to have to bury me with this bad boy.Thanks for the juice,Rock-on!Sweet Cheese"
3,Heavy sledding about WWII,"Alvin D. Coox's Nomonhan is one of those books that's hard to review. It's packed with information, has good maps, and the author obviously plumbed every Japanese source he could get his hands on, but the text is wearing and somewhat dull, and the iteration of facts gets to be a bit much after a while. It's a real doorstop (1253 pages, including two sets of notes, bibliography, and index) and very long. In addition, you wonder how much the analysis would benefit from a better reading of the Soviet side of things (not Coox's fault; the book was published in 1984, and Soviet archives were not open). All of this notwithstanding, the serious student of WW2 won't find a better or more detailed study of this crucial and little-understood battle."
3,Not worth it,"i am a heavy fan of the dogg pound. i picked it up today after i'd been anticipating it for 2 months. First off what made me angry was that i saw an advertisement in the source quoting ""Produced by Dr. Dre."" But in fact he produced not one song and had no appearance. The cd has the change the game remix from dj clue 2. It also has we livin gangsta like and dipp with me with different beats which are not even a step close to the originals on the DPG cd which dropped like 2 months ago. That cd was excellent and dp2002 is not. So i'm tellin u if u are a hardcore dogg pound fan u might wanna cop this cd. But it really is poor. I gave this 3 stars only becuz i've always had a love for the dogg pound"
4,An Instant West Coast Classic,"Dogg Pound 2002 is a great Westcoast CD, with dope beats, and great rapping from Daz and Kurupt. It features phat songs like Gangsta Rap, Roll Wit Us, and Just Doggin. This CD features Jay-Z,Snoop Dogg,2pac,Xzibit, and Soopafly. The only bad thing is that the CD contains songs from the recently released DPG CD, like Crip Wit Us, the exact same song as Dipp Wit Me but they use different words in the chorus and Living the Gangsta Life, the exact same as We Livin Gangsta Like, fromt the DPG CD. Beyond that, I love all of the songs on the CD. They have bumpin beats, dope lyrics, that make for a real good head nodder albumn. All you kats out there should cop this albumn, its blazin."
4,GREAT DEAL ON A LOVELY WATCH,"Got this for a friend after I bought my own ... the purple face is beautiful and the fit is great. Only 4 stars because the battery died shortly after receipt (about a week) -- not anyone's fault, just more of an embarassment since it was a gift. Still, great deal on a very nice watch."
1,Poorly Made Keys,"The Club Brake Lock Vehicle Anti-Theft Device #CL 606 broke the 1st time used. The key broke off while locking the unit into place, It was a pain to get it off and I NEVER used the Club Brake again. The broken key is still stuck in the unit."
5,SABBATH ECSTASY!!!!!!!,"Technical Ecstasy is one of the last moments of OZZY in the legendary BLACK SABBATH, and seems like MANY SABBATH fans think it[s not a good album....well, it[s not a complete masterpiece like PARANOID and MASTER OF REALITY, but got some great songs like BACK STREET KIDS, IT[S ALRIGHT, ALL MOVING PARTS and DIRTY WOMEN....after many many years and many spins, i can actually say TECHNICAL ECSTASY is another SABBATH classic masterpiece!!!!! in fact, all the stuff they recorded with OZZY[s vocals is classic and great!!!!! TECHNICAL ECSTASY got many unfair reviews....THIS IS SABBATH with OZZY in the 70[s!!!!!!!! What more can you ask for????????WELL DONE, SABBATH!!!!!!!"
5,one of Black Sabbath's best.,"It was one of my favorites by Black Sabbath. Was glad to be able to find this on CD. The guitar in the song ""Dirty Women"" is just awesome, with the squeak from the chord change to the bass lines, fantastic."
3,Rendered Obsolete By The Box Sets....,"Some excellent guitar from Iommi, but very thin production and don't even get me started on Ozzy (it's as if the demons he sang about on ""Sabatoge"" have begun to take over). But yes, Ozzy is here so you have to have it (isn't that kinda like UFO's ""Love To Love""?).(...) You need to hear the original albums remastered and you ain't gonna get it here; for that reason this release is pretty much obsolete. Actually would go up to 3 1/2 stars."
3,"Nothing really about robots, but still very interesting","I admit so far I don't think this is Sabbath's best, but I really enjoy this CD. This is definitely Sabbath at a different phase that wouldn't be lived again. I'm sure most people who call themselves fans of the band wouldn't enjoy this because there's no mention of Satan or anything else in the miserable gothic area. These songs are based on topics such as sex, partying, and even love. This is almost like a Kiss albumb, and that's why it's so irresistable. I really can't understand why people don't like this, I think it's a hell lot better than Sabbath Bloody Sabbath which puts me to sleep."
3,The weakest Sabbath album with Ozzy,"Technical Ecstasy isn't classic material but it's not a really bad album, Backstreet Kids, Dirty Women and Gypsy are the good stuff, It's Alright (which features the debut of Bill Ward on vocals) sounds more like a Barry Manilow/Paul McCartney pop ballad and it doesn't have that Sabbath feel to it, but overall Techincal Ecstasy doesn't deserve to be putdown cause they say it's bad compared to Paranoid but it's great that Black Sabbath can do anything else than heavy metal, If you a heavy metal fan than you shouldn't get this album and if a beginner with Black Sabbath, get Paranoid or Master of Reality first, then work your way up. Only recommended for diehard Black Sabbath fans."
2,Confusing,"What was the purpose of this album? Come on. Ballads? Sabbath? Bill Ward on vocals? I ask, was ""Its Alright"" a Birmingham tribute? For the underclasses. Black Sabbath, stripping themselves of all their creative genius, going back home to Birmingham to warm people's hearts with a soft, English pop ballad...so what? After all the fun and creative energy of the first great albums of heavy metal, where do we go from here? Back to days spent rocking in the backstreets? Cooked out radio attemps? Imagine conquering the world, attaining great knowledge, drinking wine with the Gods, joining the Greeks in Battle with the Trojans, meditating the Buddah's, exploring the Amazon Jungle, and dancing in the great volcanos of our time...and then walking back down home street and caroling to neighbors? Where does this project go? Nowhere."
2,This does *not* sound like Spock's Beard,"Too bad I listened to some of the positive reviews and wasted my money on this CD. In contrast to what some other reviewers wrote, this CD has nothing to do with the old Spock's Beard. Sorry guys, nice try but you should really use a different name and not try to ride on SB's famous name. The first 4 songs are simply crap with so-so rythm and bad vocals. #5 is the first song that reminds a little of SB style and the entire album has exactly two songs that I liked - certainly much short of expectations. If you like and want Spock's Beard style music, go out and buy Neal Morse's new album - If you can ignore the bible-thumper lyrics, you will be rewarded with [great] ""Spock's Beard"" music. As for Feel Euphoria - I listed it to be sold...."
3,Not the Spock's Beard You Were Hoping It Would Be,"Feel Euphoria is, in essence, a good album, but it doesn't reach any really high points like the previous SB albums did. After the depature of Neal Morse, many people thought there might not even be a Spock's Beard anymore. Well, to tell the truth, there isn't a Spock's Beard like the one we were used to hearing on the past 6 albums. Almost all remnants of the old style are gone, except for a few tidbits here and there. The album is significantly less prog than the past 6 albums, and in some points there is no clear direction as to what is going on. It is a solid rock album, but in terms of good progressive rock it doesn't stand out as much as any other new releases. Hopefully the second CD will be a better attempt, or, dare I say, hopefully Neal Morse will come back. Fans of Transatlantic or the old SB may be severly disappointed, so be wary of this one."
2,The First effort NDV,First let me say that im a huge fan of progrock as well as spocksbeard. However i do realize that at some pointevery band will have a disappointing output at one time or another. This Cd is a first for spocksbeard but you haveto remember that at is NDV's first time in the drivers seat. I dont have the subseqent CD's have higher expectatins for themgiven the reviews that i've read. This album does have the potential to grow on you so imgoing to give it 3 stars.
4,A sound that is all over the music map,"I first became acquainted with the PCO through Perpetuum Mobile,a piece that has found its way into numerous tv commercials in the last 10-12 years.That catchy tune is not the only one on this album;there is also the appropriately titled 'Southern Jukebox Music','Beanfields' and the animal righters infuriating 'Swing the Cat'.The PCO's music is silly,fun and sometimes strangely beautiful(Perpetuum Mobile again).Is the PCO light classical,pop or worldbeat?It may be an indefinable hodgepodge,but not in a dreary,pompous new age way.It is mostly airy,devil-may-care delight.I think the world could use a little more of that!"
5,Granddaughter loved it,"My granddaughter got this for her 3rd birthday the beginning of December. She has it full of toys already. It is very sturdy, there were adults sitting on it and it held up, so it should be around for a long time. It was purchased because it matched the table and chairs she also got. Would recommend this toy box to my friends."
3,Ok but expensive,"Not a bad toy chest; seems like they considered many things like the lid does not drop down on little fingers due to stiff hinges and cutouts, but it's also difficult to close - not sure if it's intended. Also air hole in case a little one gets inside and the lid is closed though the chest is not tightly sealed. Parts don't fit together well so the topp scrapes the sides when opening and closing. Kind of expensive for the quality but it looks good. We'll see if it holds up well."
1,lipper toy chest no good,Dont buy this item unless you want a bunch of pieces of broken wood in a box!! I gave it another shot when i recieved it the first time and it was damaged.( the wood panels were broken and had huge cracks). I returned this item 3 times before getting my money back. Was supposed to be my daughters christmas present but wateves amazon!!
4,Good Value. Decent Quality.,"When looking for an easel I was amazed at how expensive they were. I wanted to get one, but wasnt ready to shell out $150 to $400 for a full sized portable easel. My main concern when ordering this easel was the level of quality. When it arrived I was relived to find it was pretty nice. I feel this easel is a great value, and you definitely get your moneys worth. The one thing I would like to be better is the leg strength. They are adequate, but could be stonger/more stable.....however, when painting or drawing, the easel does not move. I recommend this easel."
1,Very cheaply made,"These tank tops are not worth the money!! I have bought this brand in the past on three different occasions and it seems that each time I've bought them for my husband, they are made worse. They are nearly see-through, the material is very rough to the skin and they lose their shape quickly. I will never buy this brand again. I don't understand how they can even advertise ""heavyweight"" when that is not even close to the material these are. I purchased in three different colors and each of them are poorly made, with the white being the most see-through and the worst made. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BRAND!!!"
3,Not a popcorn movie!!,"First of all this guy John, has no idea what he's talking about. The series is NOT called ""THREE"", it is called ""Three Extremes."" Hence the name ""3 Extremes."" The first part is better than the second, the first being the one with ""Dumplings"", which is the best picture on the disc. This one I found quite boring, until the last picture, which was ""Going Home"". After seeing this, and Stephen Chows, ""Kung-Fu Hustle"", I gained a deep respect for Chinese Cinema. If you have any respect for great cinematogrophy, and plot, this is worth renting."
2,Robards is awful,This lackluster adaptation is woefully inadequate next to the outstanding 1953 version. It's hard for me to understand how Robards was cast in the role of Brutus here; his acting is just plain lousy! Save your money.
1,I did not like this movie,I did not like this movie at all. I regret buying it. Cleopatra spoiled me. I measure all other movies buy it. I like the potrayal of Julius Caesar and Mark Anthony better in that movie though none of the movies are historially correct.
2,The Marlon Brando Version Was Better,"I watched the 1953 Marlon Brando version last weekend, and I just finished watching the 1970 Charlton Heston version today. Even though the 1970 version is in color with better production quality, the black and white 1953 Marlon Brando version with antiquated scenery is a better movie. The 1953 version also had much better casting. This includes the roles of Mark Antony, Brutus, and Cassius. The only actor in the 1970 version that was better than the 1953 version was Sir John Gielgud's Caesar. Ironically, John Gielgud played Cassius in the 1953 version and Caesar in the 1970 version. He was superb in both roles. I was disappointed with Lewis Calhern's Caesar in the 1953 version. The 1953 version of Julius Caesar was superior in almost every way that matters.There is a reason the Brando version costs $13.99 and the Heston version costs $8.99. If you have to choose between the two, buy the $13.99 version."
4,Good historical novel,"Very well researched, interesting characters, well chosen historical time. The story is romantic but the historical facts are very accurate and make it a great read."
2,boring,"this is not worth the money. perhaps if you want to get info on this one plane, but for general enjoyment shop elseware"
3,Great old documentary but poor quality video,"This is a great documentary made during the latter days of WW II but the quality of the video leaves much to be desired, the original film that was used for making the DVD had obviously suffered significant deterioration. That or they just did a really lousy job of transferring it to DVD."
3,Thunderbolt Review,There was very little information regarding the P-47 that as a model builder that I did not already know. The flight pictures were okay.
2,thunderbolt,"As my opinion has been asked for, following the description I believed this to be a film starring James Stewart only to discover that it is just a documentary of poor quality viewing about the plane Thunderbolt with commentry by James Stewart. In other words a real disappointment. More precision about the DVD contents would have been better. Thankyou anyway"
3,The P-47 School of Air/Ground Combat,"With a short introduction by Jimmy Stewart, WW2 aviator, this documentary covers life on the front as a P-47 flyer and the types of engagements for which the aircraft starred. It is a documentary, not a Hollywood blockbuster. If you are lacking enough air/ground footage in other documentaries, you'll want to add this one. Pure WW2 footage. No Spielberg or Lucas animation. I give it 3 stars because it could have been done better to come up to the standard of ""Victory at Sea"" or ""World at War"". Quality commentary by a known 1940s actor and cleaned-up film stock would have made a major difference. If you have ""The Fighting Lady"", you might enjoy this film as well. ""The Fighting Lady"" is the better of the two. Most of the film was shot in the Mediterranean theater of operations."
4,"I Like It, but...","Somewhat expensive for what you get. At ~$17 for 40 pods, not always worth it. But it's a nice treat. Since one pod only makes 4 ounces though, it is less convenient in the morning if you are in a hurry, since an 8oz cup will take you twice the prep time. The pods are double the size of regular pods, so one pod fits in the 2 pod holder. I like it, but a very similar effect can be achieved with regular pods and creamer. I'd like to note though that these have more froth than the regular pods."
2,Senseo Cappuccino contains sugar,"This does not work with the South Beach Diet. Food products should be required to publish their ""Nutritional Facts"" in their advertising."
2,Really not up to the quality of other Senseo Pods,"I am not happy with this product.It tastes watery, even when prepared to direction.Additionally, I feel bad about the additional garbage with the added plastic in the pods.Just use regular (biodegradable) pods and whip some milk up or add creamer and you get an even better result."
3,not quite a great cup of cappucino,I was disappointed in both the flavor and texture of this cappucino. The foam was minimal. I find it easier to use the dark roast pod and foam my own milk (heat it in the microwave and whiz it with one of those little battery-operated whisks).
1,Big Disappointment,"I find the Senseo System and all other products ordered to be great. However, this one is a let down. Firstly, a ten count package only makes 5 reasonable sized cups of Cappuccino so not good on the value for money side. Secondly, the actual Cappuccino does not resemble a proper one in any way (in my humble view). Have cancelled my subscription to this one. Come on Dowe Eggberts, rework this product to make it up to your usual high standards!"
2,An underwhelming experience,"I had high hopes for this product. I remember the first time I had coffee from my Senseo, something in my brain was disappointed because, with all the nice foam on top, my subconscious thought it should be creamy coffee. I saw this product and thought ah, at last, creamy coffee from my Senseo!So I bought it, and made it, and it tasted like...coffee with creamer in it. Yes, the foam lasts a bit longer than regular Senseo foam, and yes, the foam is creamier. But really, the coffee doesn't taste any different than coffee that I've put my own creamer in.When you consider that these pods cost almost twice as much as the regular pods (since you get 10 per package, instead of 18), that's some mighty expensive creamer, too.Save your money and add your own creamer!"
1,Senseo Cappuccino coffee pods,"Although we love our Senseo coffee makers (we have 3 of them), we hated the cappuccino. Threw them all away."
1,WHERE IS THE CAPPUCCINO,"I WOULD NEVER BUY THIS AGAIN,IT DOES'NT TASTE LIKE CAPPUCCINO..I WOULD NEVER RECCOMEND THIS TO ANYONE!!"
2,Below Average,"Received Senseo pod machine as a gift, so stocked up on a variety of Senseo coffee pods. All brewed very weak coffe & all tasted pretty much the same, regardless of flavor."
1,Big let down,"Although I like my Senseo machine and the different blends of coffee pods I have tried so far, the cappuccino is a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. It in no way even reminds you of a cappuccino. And for the price, a big let down.You have to do better than that."
3,"Not the best, but fast and easy","These pods are OK for a quick cap, but I'd prefer a stronger espresso taste and a milk taste that's not so artificial."
3,"Interesting premise, but lacking in romantic and relationship development","It was a really interesting premise, with a cool paranormal touch, but Johansen didn't seem to develop the characters or the relationships between them that much, especially the romance between Brad and Kerry. It was also annoying how stupid and stubborn Kerry was about the whole thing. An interesting premise, but fell short on character development. However, will probably give Johansen another try in case this was just a weak moment. In the meantime, for a MUCH better take on the arson investigator romantic suspense novel, try Nora Roberts'Blue Smoke, which is one of my all-time favorite books."
3,Firestorm,"I thought the book was good. It took a little while to really grab my attention and pull me into it. It seemed familiar, like I had already read something similar to it before."
2,Deja Vu?????? Wake up Johansen!!,"I have always enjoyed Johansen's books but they are gettingpretty predictable with the female protagonist and the male protagonist at odds with each other, building into anobsession and her finally succumbing to his charms. Its the same story with her other female protagonists as well. Other than a little different type of killer, these stories are as redundant as a Victoria Holt gothic novel and I gave those up many years ago for the same reason."
3,Not great...,"I am not a huge fan of this author but this story really wasn't a great anything - no wonderful chemistry between the characters, the bad guy was bad but we really didn't care, and what is with all the broken sentences - almost every conversation would break off without completing the thought -IT WAS ANNOYING!!"
1,War and peace Gergiev,Good but not the best. Try rather the Chandos version. Voices are better. Another great version (not complete) is the Melik-Patchayev one. A good old version.Martin Pitchon
3,Pretty standard stuff,"This is a new release in the teen fiction. The main story focuses on a high school student who has the opportunity of travelling to England to attend summer school.This book is not horrible, but basicaly, it is as bland as vanilla.None of the characters are particularly interesting and the main storyline is kind of standard stuff that I have read over and over again.The writing style is good.While this book is not thick, it felt as though I kept reading and reading and reading.Just an average entry here."
4,Moving Drama -- Worth seeing more than once,"Hollywood has a way of glamorizing the worst of life's problems and wrapping everything up in happy endings by a film's end. Not so with SAINT. Having dedicated 10 years of my life volunteering with the homeless on the streets of New York City, I can relate firsthand to the characters depicted by Glover and Dillon. There is no question that this movie is realistic. The emotions behind the words, the feelings behind the actions, all of it speaks to the portion of humanity that all of us are guilty of neglecting as we hurry past them on the busy streets. Stop and look, listen and lend a hand. If you buy or rent one drama this year, make it THE SAINT OF FORT WASHINGTON. And hats off to Matt and Danny for portraying a searing vision of homelessness from the bottom of their hearts and souls."
4,A Good Book,"I read this book several months ago, and it held my interest until the very end. It had that love story, happily ever after feel to it, but the hell she went through to get to 'Mr Right' was somewhat realistic. The part where Daniel asks, 'Are you Ready?' was hilarious, and that alone was enough for me to keep reading to see what would happen. This book was pretty good."
4,Recomended,"Perfect format.used it to apply over my face and it gave a good feeling. It is early to give results, but up to now I am happy."
4,Supersession Album,"It been years since I heard this gem. I especially liked this version, Season of the Witch (as much or better than Donovan's). A great CD at a very good price."
2,Slick and disappointing,"First, let me wholeheartedly agree with the other reviewers here who praise Bruford's musicianship; he is one of the greatest drummers who has ever played, regardless of what genre you're talking about. However, having said that, this record was very disappointing to me. It is way overly slick and overly produced and sounds more like a Spyro Gyra or Kenny G record than real jazz. If you like slick, shiny synthesized perfection with very little excitement or vibe, this disc is for you. For me it was a big letdown."
2,A trivial concept stretched to fill a book,"Although intriguing in its premise, Atoms of Language is really about finding a small set of distinguishing characteristics for languages. These characteristics are given the generic term of ""parameters"". The author describes these parameters in an excruciatingly slow process. One of them, for example, is whether a tensed sentence requires a subject or not. Far from developing a ""periodic chart of languages"",it is more like playing a game of twenty questions. If this book describes the latest development of linguistics, then the field has devolved into trivialities."
4,Yay for the Kindle version,"Mark Baker's Atoms of Language uses the analogy of the Periodic Table of Elements to describe the basis of the Principles and Parameters theory of language construction that grew out of Noam Chomsky's Minimalist Programme.A set of small, minute particles assembled in certain finite order make up the infinite variety of the world and universe. Baker's analogy is apt and accessible. His explanation of Principles and Parameters is a solid, if basic, introduction to some heady ideas. While not the best introduction to linguistics, it does provide a path into a line of thought that seems, to me at least, to reflect the beginnings of a genuine working theory of the commonality of languages.I can recommend the Kindle version with a caveat. A trifle, really. There is no image of the front cover provided, and when you download the book into your device (or my case, app), the back cover stand in for the cover image. How unfortunate."
2,Finger,"The quality of this product is really poor. It seems cheap and not real. Based on the price I paid, I wouldn have expected a much better product that would last for about a half dozen uses. Struggled to get it on the first time and just gave up."
3,Not bad,"The main reason I saw this movie was because I lived in Kansas. It has little to do with life in this great state, but it may be accurate for someone passing through on a train. They could have done a little more research before putting this out -- mainly on how to pronounce the names of some of the towns. I did like it, though."
4,review,this item was reviewed some time ago with four other disc on same order i don't know what happened to that reviewso here we go again
1,Error Corrected.,"Amazon fixed the mix up with the reviews they had been crossed up with Godzilla,Mothra,King Ghidorah Giant All Out Monsters Attack but it's now corrected. Still a horrible movie but one to own just for a collector."
3,Depends on age . . .,"Judging from my own kids' reactions, this movie is a better buy for six-year-olds. If the children are closer to 10, then consider a different movie. My older one seemed a little put off by the fact that the monsters aren't even real within the movie -- they're part of a little boy's fantasy."
5,"Not the best, bit good...........","One of the least favorite Godzilla movie for most fans. I like it alot even if it has a bunch of clips from other g-films. A kid who fantasize about Godzilla, and Minya was cool. Seeing this movie brought but some nostalgic times."
3,"Printer works great,but..................","I'v been using a computer since AOL was a pup. I've connected many brands of printers, scanners all in ones, digital cameras, cam corders and just about every kind of software you could think of. Some have gone without a hitch some have even come without documentation were I had to figure it out for myself. But never have I seen such a cluttered unorganized hard to figure out piece of software ""With Documentation"" as I ran into with the Brother P-Touch. As most reviews have said the printer works fine. The price was very good. But 3 and 1/2 hours to figure out how to print an address label is ridiculous. After working on this thing most of my night, I really believe that the whole thing could have been put on a quick start card and at least had the thing running in a few minutes.Again, as for the software that gets a 0 out of 5."
1,Arggh! Piece O' Garbage.,"The shed really isn't that difficult to put together. But, Holy Cow! It only stays up for about 10 minutes before it has to be rebuilt.My four year old loves it. It has been a permanent part of his Thomas layout for about the past two months.But,don't sneeze anywhere near the sheds! You'll be down on your hands and knees putting it back together for the Nth time."
4,Overall a really good playset,"My 3 year old son received this as a Christmas present. I was able to put it together in about 10 minutes. The shed is a bit daunting at first but I had no problem in putting it together and having it stay that way. The rest of the playset is well made and can stand up to a 3 year old's handling, the shed is a bit more delicate but overall isn't really bad."
2,Doesn't actually...,"This little book doesn't actually tell you how to read chant. It seems more like a how to conduct it lesson rather than ""what the heck do those dots mean?""It could be useful for a choir director who knows how to read chant notation already but needs help directing a choir. At least, thats the impression I got."
4,World War II Finest Hour ...,"I was glad that the identity of this carrier was unknown. It truly represented the pride of the whole fleet. From the inception of moving from the east coast to the open waters of the Pacific, it provided us with a glimpse into World War II past. The daily routine and the chaos of war was really brought forth for the viewer. We the Baby-boomers are able to look at our fathers and see what they lived through. We owe so much to the men and women who said ""yes, I will go."" An excellent film."
4,The Bone Wars Review,"14 year old Thad wants to be a scout. He starts to look for dinosaur bones on Indian land. The Indians find him, they mean no harm. He becomes friends with them and learns about life. Thad meets Buffalo Bill and he recommends Thad for a fossil hunting expedition. Thad gets the job and starts digging with them. This book starts kind of slow but then picks up the pace. The characters are great and the plot is awesome."
4,A Skateboarders Mystery,"A group of high school boys formed a skateboard group to build their skills, but they never dreamed where those skills would lead them.When four of the boys go looking on the mountain for their missing friends, they find conflict, friendship,and courage. As the mystery unfolds, the reader is pulled into the drama and action of the situation for strange and unexpected activities are going on on the mountain top. They must save their friends and themselves.The story has a real life setting, its heros are believeable and likeable. They show high ideals, intelligence and team work as problems arise and they find new solutions.Russell Bean has written a book that kids will love, especially ones that are twelve to fifteen. That is a difficult group of readers to satisfy.I received a complimentary copy of (Book Title) as a member of theDorrance Publishing Book Review Team. Visit[...]to learn how you can become a member of the Book Review Team."
4,"Practical, but not detail explanation","This book is very good for the people who already have knowledge of FDTD and C language somehow. In other words, beginners will feel difficulty to read this book keeping what the auther is really try to talk about. The last two example cases are very useful. However, readers should find the way to present the data files that can be calculated using the sample codes such as MatLab. If you are a beginner, then use the book written by Hagness & Taflove for deep understanding of FDTD, and use this book for the practice before your specific application."
1,Not a Book for a Complete Novice,"After the opening hype, the author begins to assume the reader has in fact taken some form of piano lessons, and he jumps into words and phrases and descriptions, which makes one look back in the book to see if some pages may have fallen out. Nope, the information just isn't there. Very disappointing after seeing his ""sales job"" on Public TV recently. Yeah, there is one of me born every minute, I bought the video also, see my review.John Rollison"
1,Seen it all before.,The information in this book outside of a bunch of bad jokes and a writing style that treats the reader like an idiot has appeared in books written before this one. The Piano Guy lifts what it wants out of other books and adds nothing new. It is a poorly made book unusable at the piano. Basically if you MUST buy this nonsense I strongly suggest a used copy as you will not be adding to his pocket from a work copied from others.
2,Lost on the Treble Clef,"I was encouraged to buy this book by Scott's pragmatic teaching method, a regular now on the PBS fund raising drive. As a complete neophyte to the piano, Scott seemed to be a clear choice for the beginner whose goal is to play popular music and the recognizable standard tunes. Someday, perhaps I will, but not from reading this book. I was stopped cold in the first few chapters explaining the reading of a treble clef. For a skill that is very vital to understanding the rest of the book, I found definitions and visual aids vague and too brief. If you know how to read music already, then, this book is useful. For those hopeful to become pianist, the answer is out there somewhere else."
2,"A small container, smaller than expected.",This item sets unused because it was too small for being useful; it would cost more to send it back than it was worth to me so I kept it and hoped someday it would come in to use.
3,Minolta Dimage Z1 camera case,"The case is just fine. However, since the camera has so many features it would have been nice to have room in the case to carry the instruction manual for the camera as well. If you are completely at ease with all the functions of the camera that probably doesn't matter."
3,A Little Too Prolific...,"The Book of Joe seems to try a little too hard to be prolific, and comes short in its' slightly overdone tale of an objective journey through life. One can appreciate, however, the sweet story of family relationships and perspective, as well as the witty illustration of a gossip-ridden small town community. Some bits are funny, some bits are sweet, but some bits were filled with unfulfilled potential to be potent and thought-provoking, and Joe could have been better developed as a character. All in all, 3.5 stars for lovely passages and humor, but not worth a reread. Look for The Book of Joe in theaters in 2006, folks- the general fear is that on screen, the story will reverberate exactly like Zack Braff's recent Garden State."
1,Formulaic and overdrawn,"This novel never rose above the level of bad sitcom - lusting after a friend's mother, confrtonting the high school friend (now cop) who keeps beating him up, immature relationship with his high school sweetheart. The author definitely relied on very canned lines that sounded like an assignment from a high school lit course. Save your money."
2,Lyte Swings & Misses,"Damn - She's my favorite rapper of all time & it hurts me to say that I really didn't like this CD. Besides 2 tracks (God Said Lyte & Ride Wit Me) the whole CD is straight garbage. Her beats get monotonous after awhile & she really doesn't need phone interludes from celebs to maintain her relevancy in the game. She should've come with tighter tracks (& maybe a couple of dope cameos from say, Missy or Yo-Yo) and her disk would've been stronger. Hopefully her next project will finally give her the respect and airplay she deserves."
3,Definitely NOT a representation of MC LYTe,"if this is ur first lyte cd please dont judge her. she is legendary. look back at her first five albums they were all unbelievable. real good, exceptional. her first two were her best and definitely a true representation of her effort. This album is not bad but not a good LYTE album. if LYTE can do what she was doing before, HIPHOP would change. She's still the baddest female of all time. only lauryn comes close. Also she's one of the best mcs to ever hold a mic. Even the masters themselves pay tribute to her talent. LYTE u are naturally gifted, as a big fan of urs just forget about competition because u won before it started. just do ur thing like before. what u did with no effort. Unbelievable MC. PEace girl."
2,Disappointing,"I am a power Yoga buff and do tapes of Rodney Yee (my favorite) and Brian Kest (if he could only talk less sometimes...).This tape as a number of flaws: the positions are too short, many power positions seem to me to be designed to inflict pain rather than to help the training and finally, the worst, there are some sort of ads during the relaxation phase, the most horrific experience I have ever had with a tape. I jumped up from my Shavasna in horror. I find the voice of the trainer slightly annoying, but that is likely to be a personal problem of mine.In short, I tried it a few times and then tossed it as useless."
4,A Great Water Battle Toy,"This gun is a great toy. Me and my big brother bought one. We both liked it. We had water battles every day. It shoots a very large stream, it was great. Until like 2 months later it leaked air and it wouldn't pressurize. Anyway it's a great gift."
5,Great Gun Brush,"Pros:Well made brushNo-scratch design using hoops of wire instead of the typical blunt-cut wire in most brushesThe tornado design covers 360 degrees multiple timesCons:May not be as aggressive as other straight cut bristle brushesRequires slightly more effort to pull through the bore than a brush likeOtis No.45 Brush (44, 444, 45, 458)Final Thoughts:This is my favorite bore cleaning brush type, try it, I think it may be yours too."
5,A great French film.,A great film. Isled le Besco and Seigner are so fascinating to watch. I love this film.
5,easy to clean and works great!,"my husband bought this before he went deep sea fishing so he could keep his lunch cold on the boat. it came back smelling very fishy but was so easy to clean up! now he takes it to work every day!!! MUCH better than a plastic bag or brown paper sack! it is just the right size to hold a tupperware container of leftovers, or a sandwich, chips and fruit and the insulation keeps everything the right temperature. we are VERY satisfied!"
4,Works for us!,"I'm surprised by how much one of the reviewers disliked this stroller. The only part I agree with is that the front canopy does have to be removed before folding. I usually left it off - my older child didn't want it anyway. Otherwise it's a smooth ride with plenty of storage. An infant car seat fit nicely. I would buy it again. However, if you have an infant and an older child who's over 2 1/2 I'd recommed the Joovy stand-up stroller."
1,I'm glad I returned this!,"I wouldn't even give this a full star! I loved my single Graco stroller and thought purchasing the DuoGlider would be a great purchase. However, after using it for less then three months, the front left wheels became very stiff and difficult to maneuver. The fabric on the bottom of the stroller also began to tear from being moved in and out of my SUV. The front canopy and tray need to removed whenever folding the stroller and they are a pain to snap back into place. I wish I did my research and am pleased that the store that I purchased this stroller from was more than willing to take it back. I'm a smarter consumer now and I'm looking forward to picking up my new stroller."
5,"Easy to guide, comfortable...",This stroller was ready to assemble. It is very roomy and easy to adjust. The seats recline to a comfortable position and can be done with one hand. You can collapse the stroller with one hand also. I purchased this for my twin grandkids. There mom can handle them and the stroller with ease.
1,Aweful!!!!!!,I spent hours and hours of research trying to find the perfect stroller and this was not it. The hardest part is that the basket does not drop down when the baby is in the carrier in the back so there is not great access to the basket. Other models do have this feature. On trips we had to take the baby out when going into buildings with a scanner so they could check our diaper bag. The canopies fold in a very akward way and are hard to put on once they come off. Do not buy this model.
5,Ease of gift giving terrific,I bought this as a baby shower gift for my niece stationed in Germany. So I cannot speak to the quality of the product but what I can highly recommend it the ease of buying the stroller and having it shipped to a military address overseas. The gift arrived in a timely manner and I didn't have to deal with the aisle of shipping something so bulky to Germany.
5,One of my personal favorites,"This is a great collection, and the author translates these himself from his original writing in Malayalam, which makes a huge difference from other translated works. The style could be called magical realism."
5,Works as advertised,"I've got a Yamaha home surround system that supports three components: Two large screen flat panel HD tv's and one Epson 1080P HD projector. I entertain alot and have an annual Superbowl party whereas I utilize all three components. One has a cable run of 35' (projector) while another run is 50'. The pic remains awesome on all three! No apparent loss of signal strength over 18ga. component cables. Keep in mind that while HDMI is advertised as ""the way to go,"" component cables have less signal loss over longer runs. My video cabinet has a thermostatically controlled fan so I have no real heat issues. Works great for me!"
4,The Education of a Fox-hunting Man,"Perhaps the best thing about this book is the clear picture it paints of a carefree world in rural England. The story revolves around a young country gentleman and his sport activities, which are mainly cricket and fox hunting. The story makes one long sales pitch, especially during our times of never-ending pressure, for the countryside world described by the author: sunny and beautiful days, cricket, fox hunting, and a cup of fine tea every now and then. The more revealing aspects are what is missing from his world, endless shopping, pressing deadlines at work, traffic jams, and all the ‘gems’ modern life has to offer. This book is not a fast read, and yet still very absorbing."
1,cygnion Review,"The folks at Cygnion think that they have a product like no other and they are wrong. There is another system that will not require to have your computer running none stop and will not require a certain type of phone that you can use and it will let you use your existing phones. For instance with cybergenie you have to use their phones or the system wont function. And then will the cybergenie hook and run properly with any computers? The answer is no, they want you to go thru all the software soft paks and they do not work. Also compaq is useing AMD boards in some of their newer computers, So guess what is not working? You guessed it cybergenie. Also they say that the least ram to run is 64mg. Well if you are running only 64 mg dont run anything else,The cybergenie will loose connectivity if ya try to go online it wont let you online or it will make your system lock up. Now there is nothing wrong with AMD system, But if the system board is not running intel there will be problems."
2,Wait for version 2.0,"A great idea, but falls short for the cat. It needs to do more, maybe if it turned around in circles (the whole thing) ocationaly, and had a speed control. Unless I am holding it and moving it myself, my cat simply stares at the beam or sniffs at the toy."
1,Disappointing,My cats were not interested in this since the beam is too quick and low. You really can't adjust it and it's just a waste of money.
3,OK But Not Great. Laser Rotates Too Fast!,"A good product but not great because the laser rotates too fast to retain my cat's interest for long. She quickly ends up sitting and just watching the beam of light go around in a repetitive motion. Random, slow and quick movements would improve this product."
1,BROKEN!,"Mine was broken from the very first moment. The laser doesn't move. My cat are used to play with lasers, so both went right to it as soon as the light turned on, leaving me with a guilty felling, as if I put a candy in front of a kid and took it away."
3,Neat cat toy,"Great idea that didn't go far enough. My cat gets bored with it after a minute or so. If the entire device rotated/changed position then the entertainment would be better. As it is, it sits in place and the laser beam repeats the same area over and over."
3,Okay,"My cat does love this product, but not when it is sitting on the floor. If I hold it and move it around - she is willing to chase the beam for as long as I want to play. If it is just sitting on the floor aimed at the wall -she might play - she might not depending on her mood."
5,Sweating to The Oldies,"I really love this video I think they will help me a lot. The music is really the key to wanting to do these exercises it is like having a party, and dancing away the pounds."
2,Not up to par!,"Oh, how I love my Richard, but this video tape was a disapointment. The quality of the recording was poor and the crazy camera work during the workout made the moves difficult to follow and just downright annoying. I was not happy with this one, but it doesn't put a black cloud over my eagerness to purchase another Richard video in the future. Keep dancing!!"
5,Richard Simmons Video,I was very happy with my purchase and the video is great!!!!! I will shop again in the near future . Thank you!!!
5,Great second novel,"I just finished this book and it was a great second adventure for Peter Dees. This time around the action takes place in South Florida and Cuba, locales that are near to my heart. The characters are believable and you feel like you're in the middle of the fray. Jaco is an excellent journalist and becoming an engrossing and readable action author. I couldn't put the book down and neither will you. It's fast paced and current with it's Florida-Cuba connection and full of action and mystery. If you choose to add this book to your holiday reading list you won't be disappointed."
5,LOVED IT!,"i read this book in one day! It was truely a page turner. After reading one review I thought it'd be a little too similar to ""Surviving Mr Right"" but not so much! I absolutely love this book and will be moving on to the sequeal ""what we did for love!"""
5,Fantastic Sound Track,"I usually don't notice the music in movies, but while I watched A Lot Like Love, I constantly found myself singing along with the music and noting to my friends about a song playing in the background of a scene. While I didn't jump to buy the movie when it came out on dvd, I did jump to find this sound track, which ends up being sold out for the exact reason I wanted it: it's one of the best sound tracks around. I've actually purchased three of these cds. This sound track is, for the most part, up-beat and attitude lifting. There's also a smattering of really easy-going and laid back tunes that will satisfy when you're head and neck needs a break from bobbing to the beat."
4,Very good soundtrack,"I got this because of ""Brighter Than Sunshine"" but it also reminded me about ""Walking on the Sun"" and I loved getting to know ""Mad About You"" by Hooverphonic. I only skip over two or three songs -- I'm not a fan of the Cure, and ""Trouble"" gets a little old, but of the 5 cds that I bought at the same time, this one gets the most airtime because it has so many cool songs.Definitely worth buying."
3,Decent for the price,"Decent stands for the price. Threading on the central sleeve is a little tight, but I beleive it will remain stable as long as one does not fiddle too much with it. I am using Bose satellites (Acoustimass 600) on them and the only drawback is that the cable cannot be threaded into the housing because of the Bose proprietary pin on the end of the cable. However the screws do fit on the back of the satellites. I have some electrical tape holding the wires snug against the leg."
5,great stands for the cost,"my speakers are heavy for small speakers, but these stands support them very well, im impressed with the quality these cheap stands are built with, thinking about buying 2 more pair.."
4,Great!!,"product came quickly and works fine. they are really heavy though and the speakers i use don't really ""stay"" on. they do serve their purpose and overall a great product."
4,Almost perfect,"I used these for the rear speakers of a Samsung HT-Z510T.Pros:++ Reasonably stable, metal construction.++ Pretty tall.++ Includes double-sided mounting tape, which is helpful for speakers without the right mounting hardware (as long as they're light).++ You can run the speaker wire through the staff, so it comes out the bottom; this is a nice bonus I wasn't expecting.Cons:-- It's a little bit wobbly in the center, which can cause it to lean a bit. It's not too bad, but it's enough for me to dock this a star.-- Honestly, I wish it was a little taller. Not really their fault, but mine. :opThe way my front speakers were laid out, it turned out to be okay (where these stands had the rears higher than the fronts), but if you want to be sure your rear speakers are high enough, you might want to consider taller stands (or get four of these, and have the fronts adjusted lower)."
2,Wiggle/Wobbles,"The appearance of these stands are really nice. The stands are quite heavy and the bases are rather large and difficult to snug into a corner or behind furniture. The biggest draw back is that when extended to their highest level (recommended manufactures height for my system), they are no longer solid. You can see them swaying and they are always cockeyed and never straight up and down."
4,Pretty good stands,"These stands are sturdy, and the channels that are used to run wire up to the speakers are large enough to accommodate the 16AWG wire I use with my system. Price is very competitive, although all speaker stands are overpriced, IMHO. Fastening of speakers to stands could be a little more secure/stable, but that also depends on the shape and size of the speakers."
3,No English instruction,"I bought two units and none got English instruction, only Spanish. Kind of weird. I guess we don't need the instruction:)"
3,Heard good things. I give average quality but good price,One stand ended up missing a logo on the base and had stripped grooves on the bottom base screw hole so it is wobbly. The other one is great.
3,Doesn't fit all Onkyo Surround Speakers,"I ordered this speaker stand for my Onkyo HT -S7409 surround speakers, hoping that the brackets would hold the speakers. After receiving the stand, I realized that the brackets are not long enough to hold the surround speakers since the screw hole on the speakers are at about 7"" high, which far exceeds the metal bracket height.I can't entirely blame Amazon or Atlantic for this, but the Amazon order confirmation page when I bought Onkyo 7409 indicated that 'customers who bought this also bought this' pointed to Atlantic speaker stands and there's no indication of the limitation of the bracket height than the weight limitation. So buyers of certain Onkyo and other home theater systems that come with relatively bigger surround speakers, beware of this limitation. Having said that, I liked the speaker stands themselves, and this is a minor issue and could be easily fixed, especially if you have a bigger metal bracket lying around."
3,"Good Value, Bad Speaker Mounting Design","These stands are probably half the price of stands that you would buy in a place like Circuit City or Best Buy. They are also easy to assemble, look good and are of good quality. However my pet peeve is that the design for mounting the speakers was not thought out very well! My speakers, and I imagine many other types of speakers, could not be mounted on these stands. They included some adhesive tape that will allow you to mount your speakers, but if they designed the mounts properly in the first place you wouldn't need the tape!"
5,so for so good,"Like the quality, sturdy, hides wires well. was the best thing out there for the price listed. I enjoy how they work."
2,Low Price but it Shows,"Product was much larger than expected in both base and support pole. I found that speaker mounting bracket was too large to fit my Bose speakers and the bracket stuck up approx 3 inches above the top of the speaker. It workd but just did not look professional. This unit is also designed for the cable to go inside of the support column so if your speakers have a connection other than just bare wires you have to mount cable outside of pole. One other quick note: Unit already had rust showing on base and around treaded areas. Will they work - Yes, are appealing to the eye, No."
3,Not fully compatible with Polk RM6750 speakers,"I bought two sets of these stands (four stands total) to go along with my Polk RM6750 speakers, which I also purchased from Amazon. You get what you pay for with these stands. Obviously, the price can't be beat. One of the bases came chipped up and scratched and definitely grounds for a return, but I didn't want to deal with the hassle, so just used that stand for one of my rear speakers where the base would be hidden anyway. As for the speaker compatibility, if you bought these for the Polk RM6750 speakers, it will not be a perfect fit. Expect to make some modifications to the stands themselves if you'd like the speakers to sit flush, otherwise there will be some movement and play. Finally, the screws supplied with these stands do not fit the Polk speakers. You will need to go to a hardware store and purchase 1/4-20 screws. Annoying/inconvenient. Overall though, these are good stands for the price if you can look past its flaws."
4,They work.,"Picked these up for my Energy take 5 and like the other reviewers have said they don't mount on the supplied brackets. Well the price was good for these and after looking at how these were mounted a quick trip to Lowe's fixed all my issues. The mounting bracket uses some spring steel bent into an L shape and you screw that into the back of the speakers with some washers. The supplied L is about an 1.5"" short with the trip to Lowe's i was able to find the right gauge spring steel and did the L shape bending on the side of a work bench and a rubber mallet.Perfectly happy with my purchase. The 4 stars is because i had to do my own R&D;."
4,Great price.,"I don't know much about surround sound systems and accessories but this set seems to have been made for speakers that are threaded on the back so they can be mounted on the stand. If those are not available then they can be screwed onto the bottom by drilling small holes into your speaker (wood speakers that is). I have neither so I had to modify the back of my satellite speaker (which is plastic) to fit a small nut inside. These details are not available to you so hope it helps those looking around for stands. In case you're wondering, I bought these for my Panasonic SC-BT330 sound system."
4,Excellent stands,Very functional. With a wide support base. I love the fact that it hides the wires inside. It also has various height adjustments.
4,"Nicely Complements my Entertainment System, However---","Delivery was quick and the stands look great with my speaker. The set-up was alright, but I wasn't that familiar with the process of spooling the speaker wires through the inside of the speaker stands. I could've used some pointers in the manual on how to do this -- I ended up attaching the wires to a coat hanger and spooling it that way. If there was a better way, I would have no idea how. Next time the manufacturer could possibly provide that information. Otherwise, set-up was fine and the speakers are fastened securely on the stands. Overall a B+."
5,Atlantic Satellite 77305018 2 Speaker Stands (Black),"I ordered 2 sets of these (so 4 stands total). Assembly was easy enough. The stickers on the bases were partially un-stuck / sticking up, but it was easy enough to press them back down / make sure they stuck.I have to very *minor* complaints about these stands in relation to *my* equipment / configuration:(1) The screws included (to attach the speaker to the stand) were 3/4"" long. I needed to go out and by 1/2"" long screws instead, as the ones in the package were too long *for my particular speakers*.(2) The ability to route the speaker wire through the stand is very nice. However *my* speaker wire is too large / thick, and I wasn't able to get the wire to sit flat under the speaker. No big deal, I just ended up not running the wire through the stands.Overall, I am VERY IMPRESSED by these stands / would recommend them to others."
3,"Functional, looks ok",Had a bit of difficulty installing the rod into the base (had to wiggle a bit all the way while turning). Base is not very stable but ok. Good value for the money though.
3,You Get What You Pay For,"I wanted to find some speaker stands for my new Klipsch 5.1 surround system and settled on these. The stands seem almost made for my speakers and setup was relatively easy. Down side is that the threads at the base of one of the stands was not machined right. I screwed the post into the base anyway. You know what they say, 'A cross-thread is a tight thread'. The plastic adjuster sleeve on the post is cheap. Don't tighten them down to much or you may brake them. They look good and stand up straight. About all I could ask for the price. Sure there are more expensive ones, but who wants to spend a ton of money on metal posts."
3,Product was fine but I received the wrong color wrong.,"The product was everything I expected, but I received the wrong color. I have had a similar experience with Amazon orders before, and now realize it is not unusual. Don't expect perfection."
3,Speaker Stands,"The speaker stands were OK for the price. They aren't the most stable when they are fully extended. The bases are heavy enought and I don't think they would tip over, it is just that the rod is not as stable at the connection when fully extended. They work well for the little satellite speakers that I have though. The speakers mount easily to the stand."
4,Fair price for OK stands,"The stands are inexpensive, don't take up much space, adjust height easily, and look nice. They can be wobbly/unstable as the feet don't span out like other stands. My speakers don't have mounting holes compatible with the stand so I used the double sided tape provided by the MFG. The tape just isn't sticky enough to hold a good speaker in the event it gets bumped. I will either try getting some black ribbon and wrapping it around the speakers or getting out the drill to make holes that are compatible w/the stand. A better mount would have given this stand a 5-star rating."
5,Works for my Logitech Z-5500,I bought these stands thanks to the reviewers who managed to hook them up with their Z-5500. I just used the double-sided tapes. Not the perfect way but Z-5500 is really hard to find a stand for unless it's custom-made.Qualitywise they are very solid.
3,Nice for the stands of surround speakers,"I installed these stands and finised setting up the speakersThere was the increase of sound quality, and my wife liked itBut, I have spent very hard time installing BOSE 161 speakeron the standI think it would better for you to modify the mounting bracket toaccomodate the various stellite speakers"
3,Speaker Stands,"When I first seen these speaker stands, I saw a photo of them with Z-5500 satellite speakers mounted. As I just purchased that speaker system, thats what sold me. But once I got the stands and went to mount the 5500 speakers to them, I found inadequate hardware (screws, nuts, etc.)to properly mount them securely. There was only one bolt each that fit snugly enough to just barely hold them on, and are very wobbly, but it works for now. It would have been nice if the author of that one pic of the joining of the two items mentioned ""additional hardware sold seperately"".I will add the stands themselves are pretty sturdy and easily adjustable and they have a fairly heavy base to prevent most accidental knock overs or tipping."
4,"Great for the money, but...","Nice stands for the money, so far they seem nice and stable. Everything went together fairly well. I only wish they had a way to mount speakers with horizontal screw holes. Not a deal breaker, can always mount speaker on its side or go to the hardware store and buy/make a bracket."
1,Be careful with this product it is very fragile and the quality of the material is bad,"I bought this speaker stands for my surround speakers. When I got it from Amazon, I got one of the bases broken. The reason? It is made of a very bad quality of cast iron and aluminum alloy. I returned the product and I came into a conclusion that I will rather search for this speaker stands in a Best Buy or any other store where I can verify its quality."
2,base not sturdy,"Decent price, looks nice, adjustable height.One of the kids stepped on the base and it split in half. Being metal it seems like it should be stronger than that. Super-glued it back together (what else could you do?) - and when my 2 yr old stood on it, it broke again."
4,Heavy duty,"These are solid stands that could easily support large speakers. They met my needs perfectly- are not low profile, though."
2,doesn't look like it,the basket that was shipped to me is totally different from this basket. the basket itself is plain pink with a sticker that says barbie. the strap is not even similar to this one - the one we recieved has two straps that are more like ties. our basket is okay but i only downgraded this item but i was looking forward to a basket that looks like this.
5,Really filters the dirt!,"I purchased some of these last year in a store and installed them before the heat went on. I forgot about them until this winter. I pulled one out and couldn't believe how filthy it was. I couldn't find them in a store this year so I found them on Amazon. I noticed that in one room I forgot to put one in last year and the ceiling fan was very dusty. The fans in the other rooms barely needed cleaning, just a light dust, not even noticeable. As far as blocking air flow, as another user reported, I have not had that experience. I can feel the flow of heat quite well from the vents in the cathedral ceiling and I am a short person. I would recommend this item for cutting down on the dust that circulates in your home."
4,Vent Register Filters are Beneficial,"I've spoken with several neighbors in my area and learned that these homes have a dust problem. One of the neighbors recommended that I purchase the ""Vent Register Filters"" and place them in each vent in the house in efforts to remove at least some of the dust. The neighbor also stated the filters made a difference. I purchased a couple packs and installed the filters in each floor vent. I'm still in the testing mode, however, my gut tells me that the filters will minimize the dust flow. I plan to order more filters in the near future"
1,Terrible,"Last month,Feb.10, I ordered one box this wipes. But when I opened it today, all bag showed the exp.12/31/2006. I am wondering how to contact them."
3,"Not resealable, but great wipes","I've called amazon twice to ask them to change the item description on this product. It is no longer coming in individually resealable packages, which is mostly why I chose this item. The wipes themselves are great. The baby powder smell gets old but truly a sturdy, moist, overall great wipe."
5,Excellent Quality & Good Value,"These Pampers wipes are my favorite baby wipe by far (and I've tried them all!). They are excellent because they work in a dispenser and just by themselves (they have a resealable package), so they're great for the diaper bag. They are very soft but tough enough to get the job done."
1,Not my destiny,"I'm a big fan of synchronicity and coincidence stories. Unfortunately this book was disappointing, to the point where I stopped reading it. It's mainly the tone of the writing, kind of ""out there"" and new-agey. If you like that kind of thing, you might enjoy this book. I don't, so won't finish it."
5,Hound Dog at his Rockin' Best,"This material also saw issue under the 'Charly' banner (out of UK/England/Europe). As other reviews noted, not the greatest sound quality, but a fantastic live performance. For Elmore fans, Taylor's version of 'Wild About You Baby' is just incredible..... a stompin' tour-de-force with nothing held back that's just about worth the price of admission alone. I think the New Rose is probably the original release, with Charly no doubt having copied it. You might be able to pick up one of the Charly's cheaper (reissued in at least two versions that I know of on that label alone). Too bad Alligator never thought to license these sides..... it would fit nicely in their catalog."
1,OMG - What the #### is this?,"Wow, all I can say. I got this from my library and being a tax paying citizen of my city, they got ripped off.I am thinking about not returning it to spare others the pain but they will just buy another one giving Tom the false impression that peopl actually LIKE this! WTF is this supposed to be?My God, what record company listened to this and thought, ""yeah, lets publish this with a big book"" I think it was the person who thought up ""New Coke"". Wow, all I can say."
4,Tom is certainly an original,"While on some songs, Tom's voice is a little harsh and an acquired taste, most of the time it is heartwrenching and/or rockin'. And it usually adds to his clever songwriting and sturdy but raw songs. A couple songs, like ""Lucinda"" seem a little creative only for creativity's sake, but there's no arguing that Tom's creative drive often hits the mark. Alice is a good CD, but this is a better start IMO as it shows his multiple sides."
4,LOVE IT!,"My daughter is 2 1/2 and she loves her Princess Desk. It is the perfect size for her to do so many things in, such as arts and crafts, coloring and eating snacks. I love the bright and beautiful colors and the princess pictures. She loves the secret drawer and is always hiding her toys in there. The only problem that I had is that one of the pieces arrived slightly damaged and when I called they did not have any in stock to replace it with. I was still able to assemble the desk. I would have appreciated it if they would have been able to document my information and just send me the piece when they had more desks in stock, but I was told to try back in about a month. The other great thing was that all of the stores were out of these desks, but through Amazon and I was able to get this gift in time for Christmas. I would definitely recommend this desk as a gift."
4,Pleased with purchase,I received the book I ordered from this supplier quickly and the blemish on the book was exactly as described. The book was in overall good shape and I'm happy with the purchase.
3,Amen...,"to those here who at least read the book before spouting off. And reviews written by MEN about a subject that affects only WOMEN in this way? Give me a break.Maybe if the medical community, which seems largely made up of men more interested in how their [reprodcutive organ] works than how to help women going thru this life altering change, could concentrate a little more on helping us, this wouldn't be such an often debilitating condition.The biggest benefit to reading this book is that it at least offers alternative choices to women searching for one. No one should blindly accept what anyone tells them about their own bodies - do the research, ask the questions and then determine the best choice for YOU. I don't need men telling me how to deal with or arm myself with knowledge about something they will never experience."
3,Doesn't work with Intel Mac OS X,"Received this game from Amazon, and tried to load it on my iMac. It doesn't work with recent Macs that are Intel based, it states it is for PowerPC based (older) Macs. Fortunately, Amazon allows easy returns, and I printed a pre-paid shipping label to return via tracked UPS for a refund."
1,Logbook???,"I have enjoyed reading the authors book, Power Factor Training and also their other three books specializing for specific bodyparts using the Power factor training method. However, this log book is a complete waste of time. The information about why the power index and other things is repeated in the beginning and the charts are organized in a haphazard way which makes me completely useless unless you are someone who hates to make your own chart and print it out for use, this book could be useful although it might not pack along well in a gym bag. Who can write in those small charts anyway, the print would have to be so small. The authors need to come out with something more useful than just a log book. Something which advances the Power Factor training routines and not just repeated information in every other book. Plus it would be beneficial if they would start updating their website!"
5,Dying to be free,"If there is a suicide every 14.2 minutes, then there are 6 new survivors every 14.2 minutes. I am one of those survivors! I recommend this book for anyone dealing with their feelings after a suicide. I am an author of a book on suicide and constantly read related material. This is one of my favorites.But I Didn't Say Goodbye: Helping Children and Families After a Suicide"
5,This is one of the best books that I have ever read,"In my opinion ""Fear is the Key"" Is probably one of the on the top five of Alistair MacLean's novels. This novel is very difficult to predict which makes all the better, because in most books the outcome is obvious. The protagonist will overcome all obstacles and achieve his goal and live happily ever after. In this book the outcome is not so easily predicted. It's a great book..."
3,Excellent product.,"We have used this product for a while, but hard to find at times. I read someone bought out the company, a Euro company maybe. Anyway, the taste was way off! It had a distinct but weak strawberry taste to it, and not at all the chocolate taste we have become accustomed to. Maybe they blended the strawberry with the more popular chocolate? Still based on specs, it is an excellent product, and keeps the weight down compared to other similar higher carb products. Overpriced even for a top quality product."
4,Great album after all if you like Creed,"I'm sorry people, but really, I think others are looking for reviews of this particular album...not of the band. If you don't like Creed, then obviously you won't like the album. Spare us of your bad reviews then! Otherwise, for those of us that do like Creed, I think this is a great followup of their last two albums. I especially like My Sacrifice, which doesn't get enought air play."
2,Disappointed,"I found myself rather disappointed with this latest effort by Creed. It seems to me that Scott Stapp has discovered repetition as a musical device, and, having found it, doesn't want to let go anytime soon.There were a few bright spots on the album, however. I found ""One Last Breath"" enjoyable, and I liked the title track as well. ""Lullaby"" is one I will probably sing to my own child when he or she arrives, but since it is one of the worst offenders in the repetition category, I will definitely cut it short.I realize that Creed was trying to go in a different direction musically with this album, and while that is commendable, I personally didn't want to go that direction."
2,Creed hits rock bottom,"Creed's first album ""My Own Prison"" was filled with great unpolished hard rock songs about personal issues and stands out as their best effort. I liked ""Human Clay"" for a while, but the constant airplay really made me sick of it and now the songs seem goofy. I was skeptical of ""Weathered"" before I heard it when the band compared it to U2's ""The Joshua Tree."" And when I heard it I realized that the only comparison between the two was that they both have eleven songs. ""Weathered"" is just too polished and filled with lyrics that are just too preachy. I couldn't believe it when I heard the lyrics ""you're my daily dose of reality,"" I mean it sounds like it came from a bad commercial message. The backlash against Creed hit its highest point after this album came out and I can understand why it was their last."
5,"5 stars for ""Who's Got My Back?""","I love this CD mainly because of ""Who's Got My Back?"". When I first heard the Indian chants, I skipped it cuz I thought it would be stupid. But when I actually sat down and put it in my headphones, it amazed me. This is easily the best Creed song in my opinion. I'm now using it for inspiration in a book I'm writing. Stapp's voice when he first sings ""who's got my back now?"" is flawless. It's a mixture of anger and sadness. And then he just lets loose and shouts it for the last few minutes but it's still an amazing experience. The other songs are good too. ""Bullets"" is a pretty good song, displaying Creed's metal side. And ""Don't Stop Dancing"" is also a pretty cool song to listen to. The singles are very inspiring too.Basically, Stapp might not have the best voice, but his emotions make his music great. It was the same way with Curt Cobain in my opinion."
2,what's wrong with you people?,This is HORRIBLE!!! Creed has now manged to crank out the same album 3 times. All in an attempt for you to fork over your cash to hear songs that sound the same as the ones Human Clay and My Own Prison. Creed has no creativity they just write the same album over and over again.
4,As good as Human Clay,"I liked ""Human Clay"" a lot, and I think that's why I like ""Weathered"". Best songs: My Sacrifice, Freedom Fighter, Hide, Don't Stop Dancing. I really think every song have great lyrics and I've been listening it everyday since I got it. But, if you are expecting something different from ""Human Clay"" or something like Pearl Jam, U2 or Fuel you better think twice before you buy it. If you like Creed for what they are and not what they look like, then I recomend it. If you are depress, I recomend it too. This album can be really inspirational."
1,"I won this CD, and promptly gave it away","Yo, man from the land of God, Stapp was a former pro ping-pong player! Come down from your rant against 'pansy' bands, unless you can imagine Stapp in short-shorts, t-shirt, and a headband, hitting the ol' ping-pong ball around every weekend, and consider that befitting his tough guy image!Expand your horizons, listen to more music, music that has a point (re: nothing you will never find on the radio). Soon, Creed will fade away."
2,A let down,"In all honesty Creed is an extremely talented band. And because of what they offered in the past I was expectant of them to continue that trend. Unfortunately, that could not be done with ""Weathered"" which was an ultimately bland release. With the exception of a few songs such as ""Bullets"", ""Signs"" and ""My Sacrifice"" most songs don't seem to have much motivation behind them. I have one other gripe with this album, clearly written on the CD is Creed's official website. Honestly guys, lets keep it about the music and save the advertising for somewhere else. The only thing that kept me from giving this one star is the fact Creed is a stellar band and their talent goes far beyond what this release has to offer."
1,"Awful, but isn't the #1 album usually awful?","As i read in a recent review, Creed are the modern day equivelant of Journey. Low on substance, lyrically and musically trite, but ridiculously popular with suburban types who don't know any better. People who like their rock non threatening, processed and watered down. Pretty much aural wallpaper. These guys arent the worst rock music has to offer, but they certainly aren't very good. The drummer for this band plays the worst, most uninventive drums i have ever heard. Lumbering. And with this album, it is obvious all the giant leaps these guys have made musically(sarcastic). Talk about milking a sound for all it's worth. Anyway, these guys are harmless, the real rock will always be under the surface for those with a sense of what matters to find. Cheers!"
2,Worst Creed To Date,"My Own Prison was their best album. Human Clay was also quite good, but had crap like With Arms Wide Open as filler between the good songs (Wrong Way was my favorite). Weathered is, quite simply, Creed confirming their selling-out that they hinted at with WAWO. Crap like ""Stand Here With Me"", ""Hide"" and ""Don't Stop Dancing"" are just that. They ruin the whole album. ""Who's Got My Back"" despite its awful title and overly-drawn-out intro is the standout track. The album cover is laughable, not that that matters. One more thing... good luck with some of the high notes live there Scotty, seeing as you can't even sing the chorus of ""Higher"" live..."
1,IT STINKS.,"I bought this CD a while ago, and i listened to it twice, then got sick of it. The songs all sound the same, and the last three are really boring and pointless. ""Bullets"" and ""Freedom Fighter"" are also plain stupid. Who do these guys think they are, Pearl Jam?"
3,It wasn't what I expected,"I gave this cd three stars because, I like Creed very much and they do produce good music. However, personally I prefer music that has a good beat to it, that can get stuck in your head and just keeps you singing the song over and over. I haven't really found any songs on here that are upbeat besides ""My Sacrifice."" I got this cd yesterday and I was playing it while I was in my room, but I didn't find any songs that could be other singles. I guess I wasn't paying very much attention. I will probably listen to it a few more times and then decide what to do with it. I'm not saying that you will not like this cd if you buy it, I just am more of an upbeat music person. I loved Creeds first two albums. If you like slow rock ballads then this cd would fit you a lot better then it did me. Ask your friends if you can borrow this cd if they have it, and listen to it before you go out and spend money buying it."
2,very dissapointing,"After the release of human clay, i became a creed fan. On this album they let me down by only having about 2 to 4 good songs on the other cd. This one, i must say, is different and more inventive. I don't like their new inventive style and it doesn't tie in well with some of the other songs. not worth buying, just get the singles like my sacrifice."
2,From Pop To Rock,"Creed was never a real ""rock"" band, they were merely mainstream pop musicians. However, with this latest album, they have changed genres from what they do best to what they do worst. Creed can not write meaningful rock songs, and sound all too generic when it comes to their songs. I listened to Creed (Human Clay) and I liked what they did with that album. Weathered changes all what Creed had going for them and alienates most of their fans. Aside from hardcore fans who love Creed, why would you want to listen to this generic band in place of better real rock bands?"
1,Cread Suck,"I hed thas cd for long time and I think it suck, anyways I think it isnt soundful, but anyways neither is Cread at all. They arent vary gad musicions. I feel bed for them, they aren;t god will htey never be, no... dont buy, reccomend. No Love for them they just suck, cread, suck , Cread Suck.it"
1,"Creed, Please Give Up","Haven't we had enough of Creed? Remember when they were big and everyone liked them? Remember when every time you turned on the radio, you heard Scott Stapp's rough voice sing, ""Can you take me higher...""? That got really old, didn't it? It was a good song, but I would rate it #1 on the list of the most played out songs in history. And then do you remember when ""With Arms Wide Open"" came out, and through badly written music, Mr. Stapp made the birth of his first child seem like going through depression treatment? My point is, that Creed could have been a great group, but we were overindulged and now I can't stomach them anymore. It's like eating too much chocolate and then vomitting. I have heard the new album, and it sounds just the same as ""Human Clay"" which turned rotten long ago. Nice try, Creed, but please, face reality and give up."
1,"oh, the album cover is the worst","Whats with the album cover? At least make them look like they are carved into the tree or something. looks like it was made with Photoshop 0.5. Terrible, represents the music perfectly."
3,Fair Weather(ed),"For me, the My Sacrifice track alone was worth the purchase of Weathered. That song moved me in the same way that Arms Wide Open and Higher did. While not quite up to Human Clay overall, Weathered does crank-out a few worthy tracks that sport soul-stirring lyrics with plenty of melodic thunder."
3,Mostly A Let Down,"When I got this Cd, I didn't know what to expect. It was the same when i bought ""My own Prison"" and ""Human Clay."" I really loved the first two disks and hoped that this new disk would be good. The loss of their bassiest really hurt Creed's sound. If there were highlight tracks they would be ""One last breath"" and ""Stand here with me"". The cd was a true disappointment to me."
4,starts off with a bang and ends with three duds,"the cd starts out with four very good songs. All of them have good vocals and good guitar pieces. The begining of the cd is very good and enjoyable. The middle is mostly radio hits which you will get bored of. They are good solid songs but having to listen to them on the radio and then on the cd will make any song get old. The next two songs(mallody and weathered) are the best ones on the cd. THEN ,for some reason i will never know, they put three very bad songs on the cd. COME ON if any band has songs called lullaby and children don't stop dancing they can't be called ROCK without the word EMO in front of it. My advice: get a friend to burn the first 8 tracks for you because they are AWESOME."
1,I THINK I'M GOING TO BE SICK!!!,"I accidentally purchased this album. You have to understand that Creed has definitely SOLD OUT! And not only that, but this album has no versatility whatsoever!!! Almost every song is written in the same key (if you are a musician with a good ear, you can tell their songs are almost always written in the key of D minor or major)If you truly are a man or woman that likes rock music, I urge you NOT TO PURCHASE THIS ALBUM. But if you are a fan of pop music, GO KNOCK YOURSELF OUT BECAUSE I DON'T CARE!P.S: Pearl Jam Rules!!!"
3,Different but hopefully this isn't it,"Creed's Weathered will blow you away with the first track and prolongs the rage until the 2nd. The 3rd track is a good experiment but should be a one time thing only. The intro is very long and inactive. Signs was the first song with the unique Creed sound. Although the first track is hyped about, it brings nothing unique to metal. The fifth track is good enough to be on the cd. It is downhill from here. The savior track is Weather. It has that attitude sound to it which I believe most Creed fans do not know how to appreciate. This sound is also found on Torn and My Own Prison. These are probably Creed's best songs to date and they will remain classics. Higher and With Arms will soon be left behind. They are not real rock because rock never dies. If you're an alternative fan, you'll like the later half of this cd but if you believe in kick a$$ rock then you be more satisfied with the first 4 tracks."
3,A Very Good CD,"I never knew Creed. I decided to buy this CD because I had seen their videos ""My Sacrifice"" and ""One Last Breath"", and I thought they were very good.OK, this album isn't a classic, or anything like that, in my opinion, but there are some really cool songs such as ""One Last Breath"", the real reason I bought this album. This songs has great lyrics. But, in term of lyrics, the best one is ""Don't Stop Dancing"", because it tells things of life. ""My Sacrifice""is nice too, but the lyrics doesn't really makes sense. ""Lullaby"" is a fine song too, very calm.But first, I must say I'm not a big fan of Rock, I prefer Rap, and it's really difficult for me to think a Rock album is good. So, take note of it. I hope I was helpful...."
1,Laughable,Creed is really bad. Stapp is a really bad singer. Tremonti is a really bad guitar player. Phillips is a really bad drummer. This CD is really bad.
1,Eddie Vedder Called...,"...and he said this: ""Excuse me, but I would like my songbook back please, AND my leather jacket from 1992, because I'll expect to see you in court for copyright infringment on Thursday.""No wonder. Out of all the crappy imitation grunge bands that took over pop radio in the 2000's, Creed is by far the worst. I swear to God that this sounded like Pearl Jam when I first listened to them. Seriously, why did Creed rewrite Pearl Jam's ""Ten"" THREE TIMES? I mean, this CD sounds exactly identical to ""Human Clay"". And grunge died in 1994 after Kurt Cobain killed himself. Let's all rejoice that we will not have to put up with this crap anymore since it's been about a year since Creed split up last June."
4,ok,"i thought that ovreall it was just ok. i hated my sacrifice at first but it grew on me to the point that i liked it much like the rest of the cd did. i was mostly only interested in listening to songs 5,6,7,9,10 at times, and 11. i enjoyed 11 and 9 the most. it was just barely worth buying a an unused one. however if you liked the other cd's then paying full price is worth it."
3,Mixed,"Well I have mixed feelings about this cd. It definatly is NOT Bad Religion at their finest but they arent at their worst here either. It just seems like songs like ""New America"" need more of an edge or you expect the cd to get faster but it never does. Not that its such a bad thing because Bad Religion can play a slow song just as good as any other band but just being used to hearing Bad Religion playing fast paced punk songs makes you turn the other way towrds this cd. For the extra track its not really worth it but it is worth the download."
1,Spend the Extra Money On A Different Compilation,"The price on this set was great, and I thought it was a wonderful deal at first. However, this dvd set has not been re-mastered at all- movie quality is worse than I remember Little Rascals beings. Also, over half the episodes are more of a ""history of little"" rascals with commentary as opposed to the DVDs that contain only episodes. Out of 4 DVDs, I think only one (poss two) have Little Rascals Episodes on them (as opposed to the ""documentary"" of ""Our Gang."" I was disappointed. Next time, I'll spend the extra money to get more episodes."
3,Handset needs some work,"The Cybergenie software is excellent for home-office use, and is an absolute snap to set up. The handset, however, is slightly toy-like. It is not well designed from an ergonomic point of view (you really need to press the phone to your ear); also, it is overly sensitive to background noise when using voice recognition functions. My first handset malfunctioned -- but the company's customer service was excellent and they fedexed me a replacement immediately.If you get the system, you will probably end up replacing all your other phones with additional Cybergenie handsets, because using a non-Cybergenie phone causes some bugs with the system."
3,Falling short on expectation :(,"Sadly, the book was only okay...perhaps, it was my fault for expecting too much from the author after reading ""Bergdorf Blondes."" On a brighter note, ""The Debutant Divorcee"" was still somewhat entertaining, and carried the similar sense of humor as expected by an author like Plum Sykes."
2,Alright overall,"The book was confusing to read. There was alot of brand name mentioning,which distracted from the already choppy story line. Alot of the characters were hard to idenify with,which made me wonder....do people really act like this? If so,I'd surely like to meet one. Thankfully, I borrowed the book from the library. I suggest you do the same."
2,Indulge in name dropping and gossip and not much else,"Like reading page six? You might enjoy this quick beach read. Sylvie Mortimer is an uncertain newlywed in a group of recently divorced socialites. Lauren Blount, Sylvie's unofficial guide and new friend celebrates her recent divorce and makes it her goal to make out with five men by Memorial Day. In the mean time, Sylvie cannot help but think her husband Hunter is cheating on her with a well-known ""husband huntress"". The characters were shallow, weak, and self-indulgent. No one was really an interesting or empathetic character. The ending was quite feeble and unlikely. The social party scene is a fun part of chick lit. However the characters and pitiable narrative failed to create a memorable addition to that genre."
2,Lacks depth and wit,"Characters lack depth, existing only as broad stereotypes, and not very likable ones at that. The plot is incredibly predictable. A quick read, for sure, but lacking in fun, which is what chick lit is all about."
1,"childish, lazy and stupid","The only people defending this trash are obviously friends of Plum Sykes. Trust me: no one who's read this book knows what quantum physics means, me included. A friend gave me this for my birthday. Thanks for nothing! It's a silly, stupid and immature book with paper-thin characters and not even a half-plot. I wouldn't usually write about it but it's getting all this press that some of us need to say it like it is."
1,High hopes lead to disappointment,"Like most of the other reviewers in amazon, I loved this authors first novel. This book, however, was a huge disappointment for me.First of all, can any book be filled with more cliches and unlikeble characters who are so contrived? I rolled my eyes several times the first 20 pages or so. Not ver believable or likeable and all the characters thus far sound like poseurs trying hard to be what they think they are supposed to be."
4,A Bit of Fluff,"Plum Sykes does chicklit the best. She has elegant descriptions, lots of lightheartedness about her characters and lots of excess. The best part is these stories are quick, not terribly intricate and everyone really has a good heart, no matter how shallow they really may be. Even the rich, spoiled and obsessed have the need to be loved. Only with more money involved in their lives than in others.Nothing too draining and problems that everyone experiences, just not with so much drama. A great rainy day read or a quick pick-me-up when you are a bit down."
2,Waste of Paper,"This book was just horrible! The characters were shallow, generic, and cookie-cutter. This book gives the impression that the author wrote it in a month (or maybe I'm being generous here). I will never read one of her novels again. She has no talent!"
2,Poor quality,"Poor quality, damaged started slowly as the weeks passed. In three months the phone was out of action. Has many interesting features but not recommended at all. Awarded more than one star because I can still speak from the base."
4,Classic Propoganda Film,"October is a re-telling of the events of the Russian revolution. However, it was commissioned as a propoganda piece so that the only ""character"" that stands out is Lenin, who, of course is idolized. There are the populace and soldiers who are on the side of the Bolsheviks but they are basically nameless and faceless as is the other side (mensheviks). However, its not the plot that makes the movie fascinating but the use of montage and imagery, sometimes dizzying. Not quite as good as Battleship Potemkin but still fascinating. Certainly, not as morally disturbing as Triumph of the Will (which it influenced) but still, a film made to support a government sanctioned point of view. However, the crowd shots and the quick cuts from one scene to the next in a rapid but still coherent fashion, resonates through current film and even music videos."
4,bread land and brotherhood,"ten days that shook the world is very good. this silent film is full of symbols and is also very chaotic. Eisenstein in this film creates chaos to reflect the state of mind of Russia and its people at the time. Eisenstein presents the Tsar and the provisional government as liars. they promised land, bread and brotherhood to the people but did not do anything. then lenin is presented as the savior. he is the one telling the truth according to Eisenstein. The filmmaker shows Lenin dominating the people and the people being very exited by his speech. in some ways this film is similar to triumph of the will"
5,RIOT FIRE DOWN UNDER! HOT!,This band jams to the fullest and will rock your balls off! If you want to PARTY HARD THIS IS THE ONE TO GET! There is no need for a skip button on the CD player. Keep the party ROCKIN'
5,Great fit!,I wear this jersey all of the time. It has a great fit and the closure in the bust is perfect so I don't have to wear a tank underneath!
5,Satisfied mom,I thought that this game was very absorbing. It really had my child search for the clues. The graphics were amazing. This game helps children develop their observation skills. I highly recommend it. It is my 6 year old's favorite computer game.
1,Carefull - Will not be delivered by Christmas!,"I placed the Christmas order on December 8th, only to discover that it would not be shipped or recv'd until after Christmas thru January 9th...Had tremendous difficulty cancelling the order.I simply thought others might need to know!As for the product, wouldn't have a clue, we never got that far!Merry Christmas!"
1,Be aware - This program will not run on Macintosh OS X,"I purchased this product because the system requirements stated it ran on OS X. Once I went to load it, I found out that you must have Classic 9 installed on your computer to run the game. If you don't have Classic 9, the game will not run. OS X users should save their money!"
4,Love it but....,"the binding on this book came completely apart after 2 days.. Other than that the book is wonderful!! Beautiful, bright, vivid pictures along with straight to the point material. Great book to have on hand!"
5,Worth the Price,"Although I initially balked at paying the somewhat steep price for this book, after receiving and reading it I realized it's worth every penny. Not only does the book describe in detail almost 160 great back roads in Arizona to explore, the authors included sections on the plants, wildlife, ghost towns, and history of Arizona. It's just packed with interesting information and color photos - well worth the cost. Every state in the U.S. should have a book like this written about it! My next purchase is the authors' Backcountry Adventures: Utah. Great stuff."
1,Miller Newton is a Cult Learder,"Miller Newton is a cult learder!! He ran one of the most inhumane drug rehabs ever. He held people against their will and ""treated"" kids with no ""problems"" at all. He has destoyed many families to the point that perents have not seen their own children in 10 or more years. I could not imagian any good coming from such a wicked, twisted, egocentric, beast. Do not waste your money and if you think you need to please go to theStaights dot com or KIDS of North Jersey first!!!"
3,"OK, but not great","I think the other reviews here sum it up pretty well. It is somewhat immersive. The character is difficult to control (it would be nice to be able to toggle between run and walk mode, rather than having to hold down the shift key). There is a lot of detail. However, a couple of things that I didn't see anyone else mention are how absolutely dreadful the voice acting is. It stinks to high heaven. It is the main reason I say the game is only somewhat immersive - because anytime you talk to someone, it seems like some bad high school play performed by Texans... slowly. Also, there is too much foliage that gets in the way and blocks your view of your character. These may not be big problems, but they were annoying enough to me to give it a mediocre score."
1,Not Happy With Download,"We recently (today) purchased one of your ""downloadable"" products online. It is compatible with Windows 95/98/xt/nt/etc... This computer is Windows 98. We downloaded it at least 4 times, each time it asked which program we wanted to open it in? We search for the Vbox\Installers and there is no such file to be found. We are pretty unhappy and would like some help. PS...we saved it to our computer... as the instructions said, under ""Programs"".Please let us know what to do, or please refund our money.Thank you for your help.Wayne Campbell"
5,Works great,Of all the headbands for wearing in the gym this one worked the best. it was very comfortable to wear and absorbed all my sweat.
5,great cd,"best cd money can buy.what a voice on this guy. wish he was still doing concerts.I""ll be looking for more."
2,3 hits and the other 12 songs,"There are three good songs on this list that were hits that most people would know. However, the other 12 songs on this album really don't compel me to speak of them nor do they even make me want to listen to them when just relaxing and listening to music. It's just another 80's band that had a couple of hits and then they disappear."
4,"If you don't know them by now, get this cd.","""Simply Red"" is one of those bands I never thought too much about, until I picked this up. I didn't expect to know much besides ""Holding Back The Years"" and ""If You Don't Know Me By Now"", but was suprised at the amount of other hits, and great music in general. Other well known songs include ""Money's Too Tight (to mention)"", ""Right Thing"", ""A New Flame"", and the superb ""Stars"". Other favorites of mine are ""Something Got Me Started"" and ""For Your Babies"". There's also ""The Essentials"" best of, but this disc is much better than that. Basically, this is really just filled front to back with great pop/soul songs. It's well worth it even for just the two big hits, and should be in any music lovers collection."
4,The Slug and Lettuce,"This is song is played every Friday and Saturday night around 10:pm at the Slug and Lettuce, Fulham, London and it goes off once everyone has had a couple of pints. I've seen people re-enacting 'The Lions roar' from under tables, people climbing the poles, monkey style. It really does become a jungle!"
4,Good product,"I use this shampoo every other week, its smells really good and makes my doggie fluffy, very large bottle for the price.My only wish is that the fragrance lasted a bit longer and was a little stronger, but i guess that could be bad for you dogs skin if it was more concentrated. Great stuff though and I will buy more when I run out."
3,Louis L'Amour Misses the Mark.,"Gunfighter Lance Kilkenny wades into a range war in the Live Oak country. To state the obvious, Western novels can be either entertaining or dull. Beware the predictable mixture as before product. This story begins with great promise, but falters along the way. The reader expects an exciting tale of cattlemen, barbed wire, and blazing sixguns in the Texas Cow Country. Oddly, a murder mystery gets in the way of the action. Since the plot can't decide between a range war and a whodunit, diminished reading pleasure results. There is some action and suspense, of course, but it loses its punch from a logical story perspective. L'Amour typically enriches his Westerns with enough authentic historical detail to stand above the familiar ""a man, a horse, and a gun"" formula. This novel is a second-string effort by the Master of the West. It may please dedicated fans, but casual readers beware. ;-)"
3,Decent console and controller for kids.,The console itself is an interesting design you have to scan cards to do certain things through out the games you play. Poor design for anybody 10+ years old. Great for younger kids though. The controller isn't to bad but it isn't great.
2,Wasted Money!!!!!,"This game console is really limited to a few games (4)and very bad graphics compared to current systems on the market. My 9yr old son did not like it, and played with it only one day. Please don't waste your money because for $70 more, your can get a real game console. I wish I could get my money back."
4,Another solid Guardians novel,"This latest entry in the Guardians of the Flame franchise provides an enjoyable read. As long as Mr. Rosenberg keeps writing them, I'll keep buying and reading them."
3,The album is ok....,"This album does not live up to there other albums . There are a couple of good songs, but it just does not match there past albums. Especially in the lyrics department. L7 does write some silly songs in there older albums, but most of there songs have a message. A very clear message. This new album isn't like that at all which is very disappointing for me because lyrics are a big reason for me listening to a band. Thats why I don't listen to bands like Limp Bizcut. There lyrics are horrible crap that mean nothing at all. Anywho, good album to pick up if you can find it used."
5,Absolutely fantastic!,They played great blend of afro latin music and their live performance is heart thumpping!!I would definitely fly to Australia for their show..totally KABOOMBA!
4,Bio-Chem stars,This was a must have for our freshwater tank. It helps keep the bacteria levels stable so the fish are happy and healthy.
4,An Interesting Ending to a Wonderful Series,"The Fushigi Yugi OVAs are the conclusion to the series. The first half was not written by the original author. The first half (3 episodes) was more confusing than enjoyable. Infact I know many who refuse to acknowledge it's existance. However the second half (6 episodes) is much better. Throughout we meet a variety of old and new characters. The art and the music is wonderful as always. Plust there are hysterical Super Deformed scenes in between each episode filled with inside jokes for Fushigi Yugi fans. I think it is a worth while investment ""no da?"" (You know)"
2,Wont hold a charge,Received the item on time as stated when i purchased it. The battery does not hold a charge for mor than a day however.
5,I Love Sensa Pens!,These are by far my favorite pen! It is hard for me to use any other. They are so comfortable to write with! They are quality pens and usually very expensive. I was so excited to find them on Amazon for a fraction of the price :) I kind of went crazy!! Highly recommended!
3,Only for die-hard old-time rock & roll fans and HL&N fans,"This is a cover album where Huey Lewis and the News pay tribute to the real fathers of rock and roll, and they do a great job. Apparently they used nothing but instruments used ""in the good old days"": no synthesizers, no drum machines, etc. It is just good ol' rock and roll. The best songs are the 2 singles, ""(She's) Some Kind of Wonderful"" & ""But It's Alright,"" the semi-acapella ""Little Bitty Pretty One,"" and the bluesy ""Going Down Slow."" Given that, it is less than what you'd expect from Huey Lewis and the News. The second half of the album is a bit slow - the songs are much better in concert. Besides that, it is a great collection of classics and a super tribute to the great ones."
3,Leaves Out Part of the Story,"I believe Dr. Joiner exhibits a profound understanding of the suicidal mind and the mechanism of actions required to commit suicide. He really is able to get into the mind of the victim in many ways. Nevertheless there is an astonishing omission in his book -- the failure to address the ways in which antidepressants and other psychotropic drugs can trigger this mechanism. It is astonishing because Dr. Joiner's own father died from a self-mutilating suicide, a hallmark of an antidepressant induced event, and he was indeed on an SSRI as Joiner describes in the preface. To shut out this aspect of the story in the face of all the controversy that has gone on in the past decade and the new evidence that has come to light leading to black box warnings seems highly irresponsible. I can only hope he adds a new section in a future edition."
2,Over-acting as an Artform,"We had to draw straws at the video store to see who had to watch this movie and I lost. The producers threw a lot of money at sending a hack crew to exotic locations to shoot this film. The dialouge is out of synch and dubbed over at parts. The sex scenes are paint by number and objectable. The main star shows he has no acting range when he stuffs a doctors head into a dead girl. OK, If you love late night HBO B-movies, you might get a kick out of the naked women, typical squib shots and bad dialouge. You have to watch a bad movie now and then."
1,too pliable,"I have been a consumer of Birkenstock for many years, and this was the first pair that gave me trouble. I ordered the anthracite wool, and was quite displeased to have them break on me only after owning them less than 5 months. I believe this material is too soft, too felt-like, and too pliable. Which is why the band on my shoe broke."
1,No delivery from seller,"Ordered a pair a month ago to be sure to have it in time for Christmas. The status has been listed as waiting to ship since then. I contacted the seller yesterday and they basically said oops - they are out of stock. Plus they claimed to have notified me which is not the case since I have been anxiously waiting their delivery. This supplier is definitely lacking customer service.If you want your shoes delivered, do not order them here."
1,Totally the opposite of what I was hoping.,"This book was hugely disappointing. After two editions of the _Spiritual Exercises_ sat on my shelf for years, I finally started doing them at the beginning of 2005. I found the Spiritual Exercises to be one of the most effective and ""practical"" forms of Catholic spirituality I've studied. But the essence of the Exercises is acknowledging the reality of Sin, evil, Hell, etc., realizing the unimaginable Mercy of God, and the fact that every sin deserves eternal damnation.So, in the hopes of helping a relative, a lapsed Catholic who was attempting addiction recovery and needed both spiritual and psychological help, I purchased this book.What I found when it arrived was just the opposite of what I'd hoped for he: this jerk waters down the entire Catholic faith to psychology and teaches the lie that Satan is nothing more than a metaphor.Where he *ought* to be elevating the psychology with religion, he's doing just the opposite."
1,Terrible edition,The terrible quality of the edition of a great philosophical work (Die Phaenomenologie des Geistes)I've purchased is beyond belief. It is a bad photocopy of a 1923 edition barely legible. I thought that Amazon would have some quality control mechanism in place. Obvioisly I was wrong.
5,good reader for teens,"This is a good starter for teens getting to know the bible. Although it is inaccurate in some parts, the pictures help me get a better visual when I go back and read the holy bible. They also could have shown a lot more descriptive pictures for the book of revelations. There was barely anything for psalms, proverbs, major and minor prophets. Nevertheless, still a great comic book bible and a good read."
5,The Picture Bible,"This Bible is easy to read! Your children can follow along with the text and the pictures, making this educational, as well as spiritually beneficial!"
5,"Simply, the best picture Bible","Everyone in my family LOVES to read this beautiful picture Bible. The stories correspond 99.99% with ""MOTHER BIBLE"". It's a MUST HAVE for kids and grown-ups TOO!"
5,I had one as a kid and I just got one for my daughter!,When I was a kid my parents gave me the Picture Bible for my first communion. I remember having it by my bed for years and I always liked reading it at night before bedtime. The comic book format made the stories really easy to understand and remember and for years after I moved out of my parents' home I thought about that book and wondered if they still sold it anywhere.I have a young daughter now and it occurred to me to search on Amazon for this book and there it was! Easy as pie to find! I highly recommend it for all kids and most adults. It is such a well done book! Now that I know where to find it I plan to give them as gifts (where appropriate of course).
2,Not the acting edition,This edition is not the one used by theaters. I don't know why but it is condensed.
2,Wrong Edition,"I love this play, and I wanted to do a cutting from it as a duo in speech competition. Though I ordered the copy shown, I got a new, updated edition from the Broadway revival, which was fine enough, but had changes in the scene I was planning on doing. I ordered it again, also looking at a copy that was an original edition, and got the revival updated one. I'm thoroughly frustrated, and ended up just ordering from a different online bookseller. I'm really disappointed."
4,"""You're right at the meat of things, baby""","Edward Albee's play ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" is one of those plays that is also a great read as a book. The play involves an older college professor who, with his foul-mouthed wife, plays sick mind games with a younger prof and the younger prof's wife. Albee creates some taught drama with these four characters.I understand that this play was considered quite shocking when it premiered on Broadway in the early 1960s. Some of its language (""monkey-nipples""?) and revelations will probably sound tame, or even quaint, to contemporary readers. But the play as a whole really stands the test of time. And much of the dialogue remains sharp and memorable (like the suggestive line I borrowed to use as the title of my review).The three acts of the play are suggestively subtitled: ""Fun and Games,"" ""Walpurgisnacht,"" and ""The Exorcism."" ""Who's Afraid..."" is a memorable text, filled with bitter humor, rage, and despair."
3,Smile - 'Ghost Of A Smile' (Pseudonym),"Originally saw the light of day in 1969, as this was a pre-Queen release. I've heard about this trio long before I ever even saw that it's now had a legit release. Nothing too special here, pretty much aimed at collecters and Queen completists. Better cuts include ""Step On Me"", ""April Lady"", the Roger Taylor-penned ""Blag"" and the all too pop-ish ""Man From Manhattan"" {where Freddie Mercury is on backing vocals, only}. Line-up: Tim Staffel-bass&vocals, Brian May-guitar and Roger Taylor-drums."
3,la da da dee da da da.,"though la bouche serve up the same dance fodder as snap, culture beat and ace of base, isn't that what we want? i mean, why would anybody tamper with the formula of some powerhouse diva providing vocals to some dj's phat beats (unless, perhaps, to allow for the diva to produce her own phat beats)?!? over the repetative thump of cookie-cutter dance beats, melanie thorton does not get to explore even a third of her ability as a vocalist (as apparent the album's few less club, more r&b numbers), but the music is slammin' all the same. few dance artists put out an album with as many hit tracks as la bouche--""be my lover"", ""sweet dreams"", ""fallin' in love"" and ""where do you go"". though she's no martha wash, she is one of the genre's hottest vocalist and one listen to ""be my lover"" is proof positive."
2,No suspense; cliche situations and characters,"I gave this two stars because Mr. Silva is a good writer. For story and entertainment value, I'd give it one. My husband and I listened to this book on a car trip. Both of us are fans of John LeCarre whose latest book was similarly about Swiss involvement with the Nazis. But what a difference. Silva's book is boring and repetitious. The characters are wooden. There is NO tension. The plot is so obvious. Too many murders, too. We have the equivalent of about 75 pages left to listen to and neither of us can work up the energy to turn it on."
2,English Assassin,"These authors are too intent on leaving their endings to create another follow-up.. and thus their endings are too often anti-climatic! When the main character does NOT really kick ass and really destroy their villain opponent in a very graphic way...then it makes it so unbalanced... it seems the hero goes through so damn much... BUT then the villain doesn't suffer enough or the ending just does NOT satiate the reader (me) for my hero's taking full measure of 'revenge, retaliation, justice'..."
4,My thoughts,"I read this one out of sequence, after later efforts. Enjoy all of Mr Silva's work.Interesting underlying political tones that perhaps some of so called leaders should pay attention to."
4,A Great Thriller With Some Unsatisfying Elements,"Overall, this is a great book. It's well-written and it's a page-turner. But, I wish Silva would keep his main character out of romances because they are not believable. I was told that, all of a sudden, he had feelings for Anna, but I saw no evidence of this in the book. They got closer due to circumstances, but I saw a bond of kinship, at best. Anna Rolfe is basically a female Gabriel Allon so a feeling of sympatico between them is understandable, but I didn't feel romantic vibes coming from them at all.Since the author doesn't seem particularly strong at writing such relationships, he should probably leave them alone. As it is, they are very weak tea."
2,Such a non climatic ending. Booo.,It is a mystery to me how such an excellent writer as Silva obviously is could write such a interesting story and then put the whole thing into the tank with an unbelievably bad ending. Nothing gets resolved. Maybe he's setting up the reader for a sequel. this reader won't be reading it though. I was looking to see if some pages had been torn out of the book. Two stars at best.
1,Nothing,"I bought this product several years ago from their website. I try and use it but everytime I do it causes me to feel out of it. Maybe it works for some people, but for some reason it causes my thinking to become more foggy than clear???"
2,A decent book but nothing to rave about...,"I bought this book on the basis of the recommendations made here, but have to admit that I didn't find it earth-shatteringly brilliant.Admittedly, the author creates an interesting plot that maintains a significant element of suspense until almost the very end. However, I found that I couldn't get into the book enough to identify or sympathise with any of the characters.The book seems to revolve around the various moral and ethical dilemnas which each character faces - to tell the truth, to have an affair etc. The book, however, reaches an almost ""Hollywood ending"" though as everyone's problems are conveniently solved at the end without giving a second thought to the negative aspects of those problems.Therefore, I would say that this book makes a good read for a rainy weekend or a long flight, but that's it..."
2,Please more Hands-On and less blah blah,"I was trying to find a book with clear instructions about how to configure sendmail under 7.2. Unfortunately this is the only book right now available in the market, and honestly I don't like it. I found more specific procedures on internet than in this book. For example, the Essencial Configuration section Part 2, should specifically indicate how to configure sendmail in order to make it work. Instead it wastes the time walking around one thousand things and not clearly. We need something more specific like Step 1 do this, Step 2, do this...., Usually the books after to complete a subject go over the details, that is better for the learning process.Regards...Piyux"
1,Thought it was the entire film ;~),"Was looking for free movies and am embarrassed to say that I didn't realize that this is just one long scene or out-take (complete with microphones hanging down in the frame, etc."
3,caine 3 - Mortimer 1,"Graphics: Very GoodPlot: Good but slowAction: LowActing: Caine - Very goodActing: Emily mortimer - OK, Not a good part for her.Sound quality: Lower than expected.Definitely not a Bronson type thriller.This movie could have been shot in a 1 hour 15 minutes. Drug out!!!"
5,You can't turn away,"Harry Brown was a former Royal British Marine whose a widower and pensioner on an estate that's overrun by thugs, drugs, and violence. Harry after he married his wife tried to stop being a predator and goes out of his way to avoid conflict as much as possible, then one day his best freind is killed and the police have little to no evidence to go afther the young hoods responsible for it. This prompts Harry to become a predator again, to dust off the more reptilian part of his brain and do what the Royal British Marines taught him to do best. He starts hitting the punks back with a vengeance, taking out their drug operations, their suppliers, and them one at a time teaching the once fearless and hearts as black as sin vermin the meaning of fear. When its over Harry gets them all, but he realizes that in becoming a predator again he can't stop being one that now he can't ever be a sheep again."
4,What did he say?,"Yes, some of the regional accents are heavy, but so what. You get the message. The ""riot"" makes one wonder where the army might be. But Caine et al make this highly watchable. He's realistically unsmooth and not agile. And he misses sometimes. But there is no mistaking his rage or disgust at the way things have gone. Good job."
3,Good despite suspension of belief.,"Michael Caine is good to watch if he is sitting still and reading the paper. That said, even a Royal Marine would be hard pressed to take on youthful gang members at 70+ years of age. Kind of like Grand Torino (revenge of the Geezers)but with a predictable ending. Also if you don't follow thick Cockney accents, you'll need to select sub-titles to follow some of the colloquial ramblings of the gang members and others.I still enjoyed the film and the violence was more realistic than most films. As a 50+ geezer myself, its fun to watch this stuff, but time slows one down thats just the cruel truth. If you don't mind suspending your belief for a bit, then its a good revenge film with a good cast."
2,On Second thought,"Initially I thought this was a great movie and gave it 4/5 stars however as I looked though things to bring for trade credit at Movie Stop Harry Brown was the first Blu Ray to go in the pile.The good about this movie, it's is well shot and well acted Michael Caine acts his role as well as he always has. The Visual style reminded me of Oldboy. Also, Chavs get killed the violence is quite satisfyingThe Bad, Plot twists although they are hinted at at the begining of the film they are almost given away as a twist near the end of the movie as cop out to add balance between Caine and the British punks so as not to have him totally dominate the little brats.On one hand it's a satisfying movie but on the other the unnessessary plot twists, Bizarre pacing and unnecessary last minute plot twists hold this movie back.At best this is a rental at worst you're better off watching Michael Caine in something else."
1,Sent the wrong product,"The DVD sent to me would not play on my DVD or PC. Maybe my fault for not checking region specifications, but did not eexpect to be sent the wrong region coding. Too damn busy to sort it out."
4,Cold hearts and callous acts,"An ex-sheriff weighs choices concerning lovers and children, while investigating misdeeds and murders. A good read for an obvious series beginning. Interesting characters, location and information."
4,An interesting beginning,"Cork O'Connor, the former sheriff of Aurora, MN, investigates the disappearance of a young boy at the request of a friend. While looking for the boy, he stumbles upon a mystery (and possible conspiracy) within his tiny town. This first book in the Cork O'Connor series was intriguing. Although I sort of guessed who the big baddie was, it was a total mystery to me how Kreuger'd get there. The characterizations were fantastic, and Kreuger did a good job of mood setting (with his cold MN winter). I DID wonder why most of the characters seemed to have redish hair, though? Also, Kreuger might as well have picked a non-existent town for all the similarity his Aurora had to the real Aurora, but I suppose that's just fiction for you. :) I'm excited to move on to the second book and see how Kreuger manages to fit another mystery into the small town of Aurora."
3,Average...just okay,"Lots of description and not enough action and suspense. There were no surprises. It moved along, but I was never compelled to pick up the book and read where I left off. Brian Freeman, who also writes mysteries/thrillers that take place in Northern Minnesota, does it much better and writes more professionally. I'd read him before I read Krueger."
4,There's a distraction here.,"The Paper Dolls usually perform for Filipino audiences. When they performed for a mainstream Israeli one, they were overshadowed by the hot, muscle-bound, naked dancer on stage. This is similar to a huge problem in this work.The director in the film is often seen here. He is hot, hot, hot! Even the Paper Dolls acknowledge it. He has that Jeremy Piven or Eric Bana type of hotness. So it's hard to focus on the main subjects when his beauty upstages them.The director seems like a nice, progressive guy. Still, he needs to be modeling or in a blue movie or working with Zeb Atlas or something. His pulchritude was distracting."
1,Full of rubbish,"The author either did very little research or just didn't care for the truth. He chose to present many rumours surrounding Walt Disney's name as facts. Mosley provides no source for his statements, other than to assert that Disney's ""closest colleagues and advisers"" were ""confident"" that Walt Disney ""eventually became convinced of cryogenesis as a viable medical process and was persuaded that, even in 1966, it was possible for a human being to have himself brought back to life after death"". In fact, these ""close colleagues"" of Disney's turned out to be a few employees on the periphery of the Disney organization who had never spoken to Walt about cryonics, and were merely repeating the same decades-old rumor for Mosley's benefit."
1,Kind of a rip off...,"This book is virtually the same as ""New Food of Life: Ancient Persian and Modern Iranian Cooking and Ceremonies "" (which I LOVE)...what you're paying for here are the same recipes only with lowfat yogurt, less oil and things that I feel we could have figured out on our own...to cut fat.I'll be returning my copy...but again, ""New Food of Life: Ancient Persian and Modern Iranian Cooking and Ceremonies "" is fantastic!!!"
3,Sadness of Import Omissions Like a Slap in the Fans' Faces,"How do you leave out something as darling as Richard Carpenter on the toy piano and Karen Carpenter, in all her twinging pal-speak, performing the Muppet anthem, ""The Rainbow Connection""? If we are to follow Rich's usual logic, there were copyright issues - simply too expensive to pay for the rights, when Carpenters music's own rights are sky-high! This compilation is far less expensive than the imports fans have already purchased breathlessly: a punch in the stomach to the devoted followers of Carpenters oeuvre. Morally shoddy and reprehensible, but not criminal. Alas, sadness gets packaged ever slicker!(...)"
3,You Can Skip It,"This is an odd choice to get the full Criterion treatment as it's a fairly tame cold war romantic comedy thriller with a very low-key romance and few real thrills or laughs. Charade this ain't. Good location shooting, and it's interesting to think there was a time when a mainstream entertainment would cater to a mature audience. But, be prepared for a very mellow affair.Not sure why this merits an ""R"" rating as all Ned Beatty's profanities have been very obviously overdubbed."
2,"OK, but that's about it.","I received this as a Christmas gift and was going to exchange it until I read the reviews and decided to watch it. Minor mistake. This movie made me smile a few times but that's about all. Everything is too predictable and the many of the characters are so clichéd and cartoonish that they aren't believable. I never felt drawn in and there wasn't any real tension to make the comedy work.The alternate sound track that takes out the occasional swear word and the lack of violence or sex makes it a light movie that a family with small children could enjoy. Small children won't be bothered by the major plot flaws at the end.I'm not sorry I saw it, but there's no reason to watch it again. If you want to see how good Walter Matthau can be in a movie of this type, get ""Charlie Varrick"". I wish that would come out in DVD. Now if I could figure out how to get ""Hopscotch"" back in the shrink wrap."
2,"The one-man Wikileaks show, 30 years before the fact - but, unlike the Wikileaks, it's morally bankrupt.","Matthau plays a CIA boss who, when taken off 'field work' and assigned to a desk job decides to expose all of the agency's dirty work in a tell-all book. Because the agency won't allow him to do dirty tricks any more. Predictably, the agency is after him trying to kill him which explains all the comedy that follows.It's a good Matthau performance because he wasn't completely grumpy back in 1980 but he playe a terrible script.The lesson we and our kids should learn from this movie is this: do seek to work for the government as a spook but, if your boss is not nice and kind to you then expose all the bad spook work. Not because it's wrong - after all, you'd been doing it - but because your boss was not kind to you.Enjoy but, in my view, this movie sux. Big time."
5,"""Hopscotch""...""Good Title""","was suprised to see criterion release hopscotch, but glad they did. here matthau is repremanded for allowing a wanted KGB agent to walk. matthau's integrity is too precious to take guff from even the CIA. subsequently, he does not take the news of being reassigned to the job of file clerk very well so he begins to write his memoires, leaking secret information to the opposition. the ensuing chase is slapstick, a spy vs. spy comedy with great international locations. frankly, using the cold war as a catalyst for comedy was long overdue by 1980."
5,"Wonderful action, Mozart music, Austrian scenery","Excellent film, Great story. Wonderful cinematography and sceneryin Austria. A great moive with long legs. Matthau is at his best,and Glenda is also a lively additon."
2,CHOCOLATE CHIP SPONGE,"I WAS ATTRACTED BY THE CONVENIENCE OF ""JUST ADD WATER."" PLUS, BETTY CROCKER, CHOCOLATE CHIPS, AND A YUMMY LOOKING GRAPHIC, ALL COMPELLED ME TO JUMP.HOWEVER, THE CAKE IS SPONGE LIKE WITH GREAT TASTING CHIPS. I WAS HOPING FOR A MOIST CAKE TEXTURE. THERE IS A RECIPE ON THE PACKAGE FOR PANCAKE MIX WHICH REQUIRES AN EGG AND SHORTENING. I WILL EXPERIMENT WITH EGG AND OIL TO SEE IF I CAN ACHIEVE A RICHER CAKE-LIKE MUFFIN, GIVEN THAT I STILL HAVE 23 POUCHES LEFT.I GUESS ""JUST ADD WATER"" DOESN'T MEASURE UP TO THE ""DELUXE"" BETTY CROCKER ITEMS WHICH REQUIRE THE CONSUMER TO SUPPLY ADDITIONAL FRESH INGREDIENTS.STILL, THESE SPONGE CAKE MUFFINS WOULD SHINE IN A PINCH IF ONE WAS SANS EGG, SHORTENING, OR MILK. BUY THEM FOR CAMPING."
1,May make you very itchy!,"If you have sensitive skin, this detergent could make you very itchy. I normally use Free and Clear All. My wife brought this home a few days ago. The first load of my clothes I did in it lit my skin up - no visible rashes really, just made my skin burn a bit and feel like bugs crawling all over me, especially in my facial hair and scalp where I touch with my hands.Beware of this if you have or if others in your house have sensitive skin. Residue can stay behind in the washer/dryer and it will affect others if they have sensitive skin even if they use a different detergent."
1,Leaves my shirts' armpits still stinky,"I've used various Tide products for years, but this one just doesn't get my shirts clean. The pits smell like they haven't been washed. Perhaps it's something about the coin-op machines in my building, but it just isn't working out."
3,Furniture Dolly Folly,When I purchased two of these furniture dollies I expected them to be more durable than what I got. The light weight carpet covering tore immediately on the first use. The wood frame seems to be sufficient to carry the weight of most household furniture. I guess for a medium priced furniture dolly they are doing the job.
2,Furniture Dolly,"The fabric on the dollies is of cheap quality. As a matter of fact one of them was torn. Fortunately, I'm not using these for furniture so that's not a problem. However, if I were concerned about the safety of my furniture I wouldn't use this product."
3,LIst Price shown is wrong!!,"I'm not rich - even if I were I would'nt buy a toddler book for 99.99 - For other who maybe misled - this should be 9.99 and Amazon price - 4.49!!Amazon, can you please fix this?"
3,Interesting book,"A very interesting and comprehensive book covering an exciting era in our nation's history. If you enjoyed this you'll love ""Blood Brother"" by Elliot Arnold which is out of print but can be still be found. I'm sure Ms. Waldo would recommend it, too."
2,Lewis and Clark fan,"Although I enjoyed this book,it is strictly fiction,loosely based on a lot of research as evidenced by the footnotes constantly referring to other Lewis and Clark books.I frequently found myself shaking my head as I read passages that did not ring true.The author did not do well with word descriptions of physical acts,they were often confusing.She even changed the name of Lewis's dog Seaman to Scannon.Why?All in all,not too bad,but could have been edited better."
5,Sacajawea,"Fascinating book! It's a great summer read. If you're not a big fan of dry,boring historic accounts--this is the book for you! Very entertaining!"
5,One of the best recordings ever (I am not exagerating),"I have gone through two tapes of this soundtrack since it was first published. I've also been patient as anything trying to buy it on auctions, with no luck! Please, if anyone has a CD of it and is (reluctantly) parting with it, let us know. For those who have not heard this recording, borrow one! Even if you are not a fan of Beauty and the Beast, you will enjoy the rich poetry selections, the beautiful music from the show and the velvet and granite tones of Ron ""Vincent"" Perlman. My favorite selection? Dancing Light/Sonnet 29. As Vincent said, ""Shakespeare knew everything..."""
1,Big Disappointment,"I was very disappointed with this DVD. The sound reproduction was abysmal. The video wasn't very good either; although, I can understand why transfer of a film after 40 years might result in less than optimal video. What I can't understand is why so much of the original footage was deleted from these DVDs.CONCLUSION: A Big Disappointment.RECOMMENDATION: Don't bother."
2,Psych-Out / The Trip,"The videos should have been edited in their full version and screen. Is making money the only purpose? What about customer satisfaction? There already are similar comments posted. So, are you going to keep customers informed about what corrective actions are going to be taken?"
2,An out-dated sounding affair,"Unfortunately, the first thing that will come to mind when listening to this collection is how aged most of the songs sound, despite all of them being quite recent. I think that Beyonce's 'I'm Superior' persona wears very thin after a while, and the whole gimmick of the band has become quite uninteresting.I was once a big destiny's Child fan, until i was tricked into purchasing their travesty of an album 'destiny Fulfilled'. I have never been able to get the bad taste from that album out of my mind, and i think it forever tarnished my image of the band, particularly beyonce. Basically, if you own their first two albums, then give this one a miss, as you would already own all the best stuff anyway."
3,good group but definitly not the greatest!,"For starter the whole biggesy selling female group of all time hype nneds to quite!EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THE SUPREMES WERE AND STILL ALL , THEY HAD 16#1'S COMPARE TO DESTINYS CHILDS 4, AND 20 MORE TOP 10 AND 20 COPARED TO DC3'S 6. DC3 NEVER CAME CLOSE TO BEING AS GLAMORUS AND THEIR SONGS WERE NEVER INOVATIVE. THE SUPREMES DID MORE FOR POPULAR BLACK MUSIC THEN ARETHA AND PATTI AND THEY CROSSED ALL COLOR BARRIERS. IT IS SHAME THAT AMERICA HAS THE PROBLEM OF FORGETING ABOUT ITS MUSICAL LEGENDS AND PIONEERS. Given that dc3 is a good group who i myself have liked from the begining, and am one of the ones who really liked the survivor album. Beyonce will never be as accoplished or sucessful as diana ross or whitney houstion, but still is a very goog performer, and definitly one of the betters out thewr today!"
5,Destiny's child #1's,"This is an awesome CD! I don't get tired of listening to it- plus it's dual sided, one with just the songs and the other side with most, if not all, of the videos for the songs. So cool!"
4,Much better than twisting by hand,"I'm not an aviation tech so these aren't critical.For home / DIY / Racing use these are fine, quality vs price is good balance."
3,"Ok, not great","These are fine pliers for occasional use, but they're certainly not anything too special. The mechanism you pull on to get them to spin is all plastic, which makes me feel like I'll end up breaking them sooner or later. If I had known that from the beginning, I would have probably bought something else. They do come with a decent little pamphlet outlining how to correctly safety wire things, so that's nice if you haven't ever used safety wire before and you need some pointers."
3,Coach,Take 1/day to keep yourself regular without having to eat yogurt. Good for those taking medications which cause constipation like antibiotics or lots of calcium.
2,Wow,"I do not understand the glowing reviews for this book. It has grammatical errors, run-on sentences and some parts just don't make sense.I gave it two stars because my son somewhat enjoyed it. Thank goodness it was a library book and I didn't pay for it!"
2,A Tonka disapointment,"The reason I bought this for my Grandson is that he likes to sit on the forklift at my warehouse.This forklift is poorly engineered. The tilt feature rarely works unless you give it a push. The tilt never works if the plastic pallet is on the forks. (not enough power) The forks do not go low enough to pick a pallet unless you use the tilt which does not work.The first one I received, I sent back thinking it was defective. But the replacement works as poorly as the first.What a disapointment."
2,Wildlife Management: Upland Game and General Principles R.E. Trippensee,This book is very outdated in the field of wildlife management. I bought it just to have in collection of thouse books.
3,Patient wine rack,"Ideal for what we were after but it took a very long time to arrive and when it did the bottom strut was broken and needed glueing! Fixed it rather than waiting a further 7 weeks for delivery! To the manufacturers credit, we were compensated for the delay."
4,outstanding value for all wood wine rack,"I was having difficulty finding a quality wood wine rack to display in my kitchen that would go with existing black and cherry kitchen accents, that would also hold more than 10 bottles. Although this was already finished with lacquer, I choose to sand down the parts (since you have to easily assemble once you receive) and then re-stain with a dark cherry wood varnish. Although this process took some time due to the nooks and crevices, it was so worth it! I sanded the pieces and put it together first, then stained and varnished it.It turned out great and is very sturdy. I have it on a flat kitchen floor surface, so I have no worry about it tipping over. The flat top allows me to keep my decanter on top, as well as my bottle openers in a bowl.The design keeps the bottles with a slight tilt toward the cork, which is ideal for my wine storage needs."
3,expensive,"for product of this price I would have expected the wood that is used to be a lot better. the first one I got in the mail had chunks missing and not just small ones that could be hidden. The second on had a crack, but I was able to hide because in was on the base of one of the ""feet"". Having to mail back the first one I didn't want to deal with it anymore. The ""tool"" that comes in the boxes to put the wine rack together doesn't help at all, have to use heavy duty tools. After this product I will stick to buying books off of here from now on."
4,Very heavy,I love this rolling pin but I wasn't super pleased with stuff sticking to it. I found that adding flower doesn't work as well as it would with a wooden pin but i still love the weight and look of this.
3,It works...,"My mother has had a marble rolling pin for years and they are my preferred tool for anything that requires it. Other reviewers have noted that the hole through which the handle goes is bored off-center, and it certainly is. Frankly, for what I paid for it, for how often I do actually use it, and for not being a professional or perfectionist baker, it is more annoying than really a deterent for using it. We are a young military family and move frequently and if this was to get lost or broken in a move, it isn't going to break my heart. The weight is good, it helps keep my dough cool, and it doesn't make me work so hard to flatten out my dough. It also helps my 3-year-old roll out dough without her getting so frustrated. It certainly is a step up from any wooden or ""non-stick"" rolling pin I've ever used."
1,Not useful at all--really not worth buying.,"This guide was not useful to us at all on our recent trip to Maine. We traveled from Portland north to Bar Harbor over the course of 8 days, using Frommer's New England, Fodor's New England, and this guide, as well as the AAA tourbook. This guide is organized alphabetically by the name of the B&B; if you want to find something by location, which is how most of us travel, you have to dig through the cross-reference in the second index in the back of the book. It also fails to make recommendations, merely describing a series of lodging choices in vague terms that leave you wondering what you might be getting into. The book lists positive quotes from other reveiwers on its back cover. I don't know how these were solicited, if the reviewers even read the book, they obviously knew nothing about New England."
1,"poor communication, wrong book sent","I ordered a used book, Elements of Modern Abstract Algebra, from A1Book via the Amazon web site. The book was only about $5 and with shipping the total was about $9. A1book send the incorrect book. Trying to contact them was almost impossible. When i finally did it was like speaking with robots. It has taken me over six email to straighten the matter, and so far I still do not have the correct book and am out of pocket the return shopping cost and according to A1book the matter is closed. What a nightmare to deal with them...."
3,HUGE HEAD little glasses,"they worked and stayed on all night, everyone loved the bubbles costume. but the glasses broke near the end of the party, so its good if you only need them once."
4,Handy Dandy!,This handy dandy little guide has been traveling with me this summer and made it so easy to figure the exchanges when eating out. Very helpful.
2,disappointed,Not enough information in this book...wanted one that has counts for restaurants and fast food...prepared foods..
3,Not her best...,"I'm afraid I have to echo some of my fellow reviewer's sentiments. This book felt disjointed and the characters, with the exception of Jonathan, were not likable for me at all. I didn't like the end, and I kept waiting for something good to happen to any of the characters, but I felt it never really did."
1,Not Wickham at her best,"I usually enjoy reading Madeleine Wickham's novels. They are purely self-indulgent, and feature interesting plot and flawed yet sympathetic characters. Except this one. You can tell she feels no affection or interest in the characters she created, as they are vapid and unlikeable at best and contemptible at worst."
3,Okay but not a keeper,"This was an ""okay"" book. It was an entertaining read and the characters were believable and interesting. I already knew of the author through the Shopaholic series. I think some of my reaction to this book is a result of familiarity with her style in that series.I liked the plot, although some loose ends were not tied up at the conclusion of the book. There were a couple of characters that just sort of disappeared, although I was interested in what happened to them."
1,Depressing Read,"I just finished this book and it was HORRIBLE! I thought maybe if I kept reading it would get better...guess what? It didn't, it got worse. It's described as being sharp and funny by Family Circle but I honestly think they read another book because there was absolutely nothing funny whatsoever about this thing. It's about a bunch of different people that are connected because of a house that the Chambers are trying to sell. The only people that I weren't annoyed with in this book were Jonathan Chambers, Witherstone's two boys, and Piers. The rest are shallow and superficial. I also hated the way one person is telling the story and in the next paragraph someone else is and it's all in first person. I don't understand! I love everything written under her other name (Sophie Kinsella)!"
4,Loved it and couldn't put it down!,"Madeleine Wickham/Sophie Kinsella has always been a favorite of mine. I started off with the Shopaholic series and now have read every book written by her, and have loved them all.A Desirable Romance does not stray from the author's usual formula of a light, funny and quick read. Although unrealistic at times, the plot and characters are interesting and unique, and I found myself now really rooting for anyone so much as I was rooting for everyone.If you are looking for something fun and upbeat, memerizing and interesting, this one could be for you. Grab it for a day at the beach or just a day off, and you won't regret it."
2,disappointment,"A desirable Residence, by Madelaine WickhamA previous book by this author, in conjuction with Sophy Kinsella - (are they one and the same author?) was a fun read; a pleasant way to while away an idle afternoon. It moved at a brisk pace, had entertaining situations, with sufficient, interesting twists and turns, and an unusual heroine for whom I developed a sneaking admiration.But this book is plodding and not very interesting. I couldn't get into the plot, the characters were so pedestrian, they left me cold. In fact, the lead character simply irritated me with her total lack of self awareness which was clearly the motive for her destructive behaviour. All I could think was how stupid she was. And since she was meant to be the heroine, or the centre of the action, I couldn't force myself to finish."
5,Love it,I am a long time fan of Sophie Kinsella/ Madeline Wickham. She just doesn't disappoint! I find myself quite wrapt in the stories and want to see what she does next.
2,Not my favorite Madeline Wickham novel,"This is not my favorite book by Madeline Wickham. It's a fast read, and I kept thinking it was going to get better and I kept waiting for it to get really good. Then it just ended and left me disappointed. I much prefer her writing under Sophie Kinsella."
3,Ok but not great,I also found the bike lacking. The gears didnt work right when i bought them and i took the bike back for adjustment. No better and the chain broke. I had a new chain put on. It broke again. I had another chain put on and plan to sell the bike for cheap. It would make an ok bike for riding around campus but i wouldnt take it anywhere too far from home!

2,Essentially... Socialist Propaganda,"This novel has one main message, and it goes to all lengths to send it, while making no concessions to the other side. That message is that socialism is good, capitalism is bad, and that's all there is to it. The only ""conservative"" who actually had a good side was Esteban Trueba. But guess what? Near the end, he begins helping the socialists. So much for the only conservative who wasn't entirely evil. There's another conservative who steps into the spotlight near the end... and he is essentially evil incarnate. He imprisons, rapes and brutally tortures the main character, never showing any mercy or emotion. Of course, all socialists are shown to be almost superhumanly kind and generous. All in all, I found this novel to be quite shallow, and the message to be too blunt."
2,The House of the Spirits,I felt the book was interesting but long and unusual. I am glad I read the book but would not highly recommend it to other readers.
3,A review for You,"Isabel Allende tells the story ( and really she is a storyteller) about the lives and loves and troubles of a family in a country in South America. Although the story is beautifully written (although the images sometimes are a little bit forced, but maybe that is just my dutch translation), I didn't feel it was a superb book. Here's why. The caracters are two-dimensional. Reading the book I could guess where the story was going and the main reason is that the caracters are to logical. In given her caracters limited space to move beyond the expected Isabel Allende isn't doing her story a favour and that's a real pity because otherwise I really enjoyed escaping in the book for a couple of hours. A good book that could have been great."
4,House of Spirits,"I thought that this book was wonderfully written, and that the plot was also fantastic. The only complaint I would have is that the political mumbo-jumbo got in the way of the plot which I found interesting. In this book there are really 2 stories. One of the Trueba family, and another of politics. The first includes the lives of 3 generations of daughters, each with a seperate identity, yet still being unified by their history together. I would recommend this book mainly to women, as it is based on 3 women's lives."
5,A true work of art,"Having read both editions of Isabel Allende's literary masterpiece THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS, it is safe to say that her gift for storytelling and infinite imagination has given birth to a true classic. Her adaptation of magic realism to the world and life of the Trueba family is only slightly surpassed by Gabriel Garcia Marquez ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE. One grows to love or hate all the characters in the novel, which she gives in such intimate details that one begins to actually feel as if they have come to life. In short I highly recommend this novel, it will take you to a world so full of fantasy yet so close to reality"
2,The House of Spirits,Do not understand why this was a best seller. Perhaps something might have been lost in the translation: my interest to continue past the third chapter. Finished it then left it in auto repair waiting area.
3,comme ci comme ca,"Even though I must that this novel at first captivated me and seemded quite interesting, the plot became redundant thus making the book too long. I think Allende would have done a better job had she shortended up her story."
1,over priced,don't you think you are a little over priced in this econmy today i don't think any one would buy that movie i'm not trying to be mean just practical
2,You have read this book already,"So far I haven't suspected the lack of imagination in the L. E., Jr. Modesitt, but after this book I begun to wonder. When I passed the middle of the book, I had to check that I hadn't taken one of the Recluce books by mistake. I mean, the similarities are too numerous to be accidental. The sorcerer and sorceress who fall in love, the watersprout that is created by Secca, the engine that the smith is trying to build (which is mentioned once for no apparent purpose) - all these elements are already familiar to anyone who read the Recluce series.I also got the imperssion that to prolong the series, author is adding the elements that are not organic for these series, and they look foreign (for example all the line of the Ladies of the Shadow). In short, for me the book was a disappointment."
5,Another great Modesitt book,"This is another homer for L.E. Modesitt, Jr. He continues building worlds that are viable and peoples them with believable characters that react in human ways. Although he does occasionally becomes a little ""preachy"", his observations are spot on and undeniable. I would recommend this book to anyone that loves a good ""swords and mage"" type story."
2,Nothing is Secret,"I was surprised at the way the author describes her parent's divorce. Since both are still alive, I would imagine that they might regard the telling as too personal and intrusive. Why does the reader need to know, for example, that her mother used the personal ads in a magazine to find a successor for the husband she wanted to leave? Moreover, I wonder why this is even in her book when it has absolutely nothing to do with the underlying theme."
5,Got the job done!,It gives an amazing blast that has proven to speed up my slow sinks each time it was tried.I have used it several times always with a successful result.
1,Waste of time and money.,"The Power Plumber's way of clearing your drain is to close the drain and drainhole, fill the sink with hot water, and then open the drain. The pressure of the water is supposed to blast through the clog.It doesn't. Get a snake or vinegar and baking soda instead."
1,this is NOT Sugar Ray,"this cd disgusts me. this band makes me sick. sugar ray used to be a badass punk band. go listen to lemonade and brownies and floored. that is sugar ray. this is complete and utter crap. i hope mark mcgrath is having fun and making money because he's doing it at the expense of the listener, and he's alienating his true fans. don't buy this record."
2,"Disappointing sequel to ""Sugar Ray""","I have eagerly anticipated this new album from Sugar Ray, but unfortunaly, it has disappointed me. Their last self-entitled album returned to the roots with classic rock with a twist, like the songs ""Answer the Phone"" and ""Under the Sun"" - this new album doesn't. Sure, there are some great songs like ""Chasin' you Around"", but it just isn't the Sugar Ray I know and love. The last album also had some quiet melodies, which was okay, because they managed to combine both styles, but this is takin' it too far.I've always had the feeling that Mark McGrath would love to go mainstream, and I won't blame him, but this shouldn't be the way... and come on, a team-up with Shaggy?! I'm sorry, but I won't recommend this CD to anyone who enjoyed their last effort."
5,Tissue box Romance,"Carly Nolan has made a good life for her and her son; she has even started to paint once again. She is surrounded by friends and she might even be happy. When a stranger comes to town he befriends Carly, even decides to settle down in the community. Landis has penned a romance so intriguing you will find it hard to put down. ""Lover's Lane"" is a suspense filled romance that will have you grabbing for tissue after tissue clear through to its satisfying conclusion. Jill Marie Landis is a talented writer destined to spend years on the best-seller list.Beverly J Scott, author of Righteous Revenge and Ruth Feverhttp://www.beverlyjscott.com"
5,Sleek design... Great value,"Sleek design comapred to 300 model... Played CD-RW, SVCD, DVD's, MP3s in first try ... like the S-VIDEO and Optical outputs. Used the hack from dvdrhelp.com to make it region free system."
4,Is the input voltage 110-240V 50-60Hz?,"It was said in the commercial of the DP300 that the input voltage was 110-240V 50-60Hz but that's not true. I wonder if the same thing happens to the DP302. If you have this product, could you let me know at dvt@ou.edu?The second problem with the DP300 is that the mp3 playback function doesn't work well with the drum's sound. Is it improved in the DP302?Thanks"
4,DVD Eater?,"Loved the machine out of the box, but after we loaded a dvd we hit the eject button and out came the tray -- but no dvd! I managed to extract the disc, but it wasn't easy. It hasn't happened since (I just got it last week), but I'd be curious if this is a common problem."
1,Usual issues with German Engineering,"Just spent 2 hours putting this thing together. I might not be a handyman, but with 2 toddlers in the house, we put things together for kids based on instructions weekly. These were by far, by a huge margin, the absolute worst.Plus a few small problems. The screws for the seat were wrong size, so the seat is unacceptably loose. The front wheel lock does lock the steering but not the pedals as described. Have to spend more time to disassemble, send it back, and get a new. The kid did love it in the story asseblied. Reminds me of all the issues I used to have with my Mersedes. That explains why I drive Acura now."
2,One of the worst instruction manuals ever,"I purchased this tricycle on the recommendation of several parents. They told me their children loved riding it, and the parents loved that they could lock the wheels and control the tricycle during early ages.What they didn't tell me is that they all purchased the tricycle already built at a toy store.So I bought one online, and much to my chagrin, I just spent over two hours putting it together. The manual was the worst I've ever read (or not read, since there are no translations), there were parts left over and items (like the red plastic piece that's supposed to snap into the front wheel fender) that didn't sit properly into place or were poorly calibrated to fit together.If Kettler is going to tout themselves as the ""happy"" tricycle they need to consider the happiness of the parent who decides to purchase this product unassembled."
4,Great chillout collection,"""Premiers Symptomes"" is a collection of early European singles by Air, before ""Moon Safari"" was released. While the songs are neither as memorable nor as compelling as those on ""Moon Safari,"" this EP is quite good. The songs flow togther extremely well and in a rather seamless manner. I often put this CD on replay and let it play several times in a row because it is such great mellow background music. Highly recommended for fans of Air and chillout techno."
5,Superb - I'd Give it 7 stars,Amazing stuff. I'm glad groups like this still exist. And you get the video on the CD as well.
2,'Airy Fairy' !!!,"Just not as good as Moon Safari! Sorry guys! This ain't my cup of tea as I don't think Air's fantastic tunes need much remixing. Having said that, 'Le Soleil est pres de moi' is a pretty cool song. If your a fan of the satirical 'cheesiness' of Moon Safari, this one's not for you. My advice to you if you've just bought it and are feeling pretty gutted - go sit down and blast-up a bit of 'Ce Matin La'!"
4,How about the beach?,"After picking up Moon Safari and 10,000hz and being greatly impressed by both, it was time to search for more Air music. Premiers Symptomes is a more ambient offering, with only ""Brakes On"" packing a bit of a punch. However, this is no critiscm of the EP, as the set of songs provide a relaxing and enjoyable journey. Don't buy if you expect to purchase another Moon Safari because this is different. However, if you are a Moon Safari fan, this is most definately worth a look."
5,We Need More Like This.,"With a panel of very prominent and familiar authoritative people of the day partiscipating on topics of modern day concern it was impossible for me to even heed an urgent call for the restroom. Absolutely the most interesting televised program I have ever watched. In fact, it will definitely cause one to rethink how certain laws are interpreted and applied as well as discover the loopholes therein. Highly, highly recommended."
4,Good family entertainment,"The first time through it wasn't incredibly funny, however, after we watched it 10 times or so, we began to pick up on some of the funnier details and now it is frequent topic of conversation to invoke laughter. Thanks, Don, for another good one!"
4,FUNNY DON KNOTTS,Don Knotts and good 'clean' humor that you can relax to watching in the evening. I even like to watch his movies over again.
5,Classic Knotts,"I remember watching Don Knotts in comedy movies and on TV as a child and they always made me laugh. There just aren't enough movies that are funny without being overdone. A dentist names Painless, a wagon train, cowboys, Indians and a touch of romance, what more can you ask for? Just great fun."
5,Enjoyed it,Its nice to watch the older shows good family show I will tell others about it funny good laughs thanks
4,Not sure how to describe this,"Once in a while I come up blank. This movie interested in mostly a cultural way as seeming very Hispanic or Mexican to me. The plot didn't do much for me, but I confess I was surprised by the end where the mother totally gives in. I did not expect that. I gave it four stars not because I liked it so much or thought it great but because it is rather unique in a way. The cast seemed to do OK. The lead boy at the end was a little too smarmy in my view, but who knows?"
1,I dont like it at all,"i had it for 1 year and it didnt work anymore, the software is so bad and everything is so bad. Bad , bad , bad."
5,Best online game,This game is by far the best online game ever. With countless hours of gameplay and a good story line this is definitely worth 20 bucks.
1,dont buy,WoW is a great game. Just don't buy the battle chest becouse its a European version of the game so u can't play it with anyone from the USA.Ill have to buy a new game which sucks becouse I lost out on some $$
3,Both books are disappointing,It's a good set because you can save a few bucks buying it all together. The books however are not really that great. The second (Burning Crusade) is somewhat lacking in information. Both have no index making them hard to use as a reference. And both have what has to be the world's smallest font. So in addition to the eye strain of staring at your PC for hours you can now also enjoy squinting at the text printed on these pages.
5,Awesome,"Awesome game, have had this for a while...the one I bought here was a gift, and the person plays it, so I guess they like it."
4,good basic information,"I found ""Chicken Tractor"" to be a good basic informative book,though some information was repeated several times which was a little annoying. The designs for the tractors are simple constuction leaving plenty of room for my ideas and modifications. I liked this book because it gives the complete information I needed to start my project with confidence."
5,Advice From a Qualified Professional,"As a professional pianist, I seem to love listening to piano above other instruments. Of course, my ""qualification"" may serve as a warning. Maybe I listen to piano differently than civilians (as I call non-pianists).I first heard Sandra Tsing Loh's piano music on ""This American Life"", a show on the radio. Her piano music is haunting, but also often lively and fun. Loh uses unusual modes and unusual off-balance meters. It's like new age because of the use of the less emphatic modes. But it isn't as introverted, as new age music can be, because of the jaunty rhythms.The CD has some recurrence of ideas when I would have been just as happy to hear more of Loh's different ideas, but it is a satisfying collection of pieces. Thanks, Sandra, for your music and your great stories on the radio!"
3,Placebo effect?,"I ran this in our '02 Cougar and the MPG hasn't changed at all. I keep track of every fillup and 9 fills after using this, no difference. I also cannot honestly say that the car runs any differently. No change in acceleration or anything like that. Anyway, I still feel better about cleaning the ""insides"" of the fuel system."
4,Cleaner works as well as chevron techron,I used chevron techron in three cars prior to this both contain PEA both do a great job cleaning. This probably better but also $4 more a bottle. Overall cleaner slightly better mpg.
1,Poor quality - old,I have purchased Godiva chocolates a few times and have always found them to be old and dried out. I think the company has a problem with keeping stock fresh. I have never had this problem with other chocolate brands. For as much as Godiva charges for a premium product at least the product could be fresh and tasty instead of dry and tasteless.
5,Definitely a 5 star acoustic-electronica album,"I had to write a review after I saw some single star ratings: This album is very creative in its success to put acoustic and moody synthesizer (spelled correctly?) combinations into a laid-back jazzy electronica album. The vocals by Beth Hirsch on some of the songs are very touching. You even get a touch of the 60's synthesizer sounds. Listen to the samples of all the songs: All of them are close to 5-star. I guess French people are really good at playing around with the synthesizer. Whether you are a trip-hop, electronica, or fusion-jazz lover (or even a pop fan) there is some thing for you in Moon Safari."
5,Lush landscape of sounds,"The first time I heard Sexy Boy I was sold. I bought the CD and was blown away by La Femme D'Argent. The whole CD is very dreamy, very atmospheric, and very seventies-esq. It is the perfect CD for a midnight road-trip across the Arizona desert in a roadster, with the top down and the sky big."
3,Pleasant but Canned--Mix is Off,"Waited years before I finally bought this and now I remember why. ""All I Need"" and ""Femme d'Argent"" are delightful summer-day, mellow, fluffy songs. Except for those, though, this is elevator/shopping mall/quaalude music, especially the last 4 VERY SLOW songs, omg, zzzzzzz....Moreover, the mix is strangely harsh and metallic for this type of music; the treble seems excessive, making the keyboards and effects almost painfully sharp. It's tolerable on an Ipod with the right EQ setting, but on a home stereo it's shrill even with bass turned up and treble turned down. This aggravates what would be a minor annoyance: the many unnecessary, sustained high synth tones and even hisses in the background. These would be subliminal if the mix were right. But they are brought forward, and become noticeable flaws.My advice: download ""Femme d'Argent"" and ""All I Need"" as MP3s. Save your CD money for a disc with more good tracks on it."
2,256 Reviews,"Maybe I should have read a few more reviews. This is what I think music will sound like in 2010. 2 robots on computers playing pleasant music, but no real heart or emotion. They claim to play bass and guitar but it still sounds synthetic to me. I didn't notice if there was a real drummer, and often it doesn't matter especially for this kind of music, but the whole thing lacks something. It's not bad music, it's perfectly fine to listen to, but wouldn't you rather spend your money on something that is really great, like Theivery Corporation or Zero 7? I'd pass."
3,Busting out with 70's Moogy synth rifs,"Fun, if a bit goofy and heavy on the Moog synthesizer sound reminisent of the 70's. Talkie Walkie seems more sophisticated, with tastier basslines."
5,I'd rate it more than 5 stars if I could,"All I have to say is WOW! I have never heard anything like AIR before! If it were not for seeing their video, ""Sexy Boy"" on MTV, I would have never heard of them. I am usually not the type of person who buys a CD after hearing just one song, but I did this when I heard ""Sexy Boy."" This entire CD is absolutely unbelievable. Why can't there be more innovative, creative bands like AIR out there? This band is in a category all their own. Not only is their music relaxing and soothing, it has so much depth to it. Each song is so different. This is by far one of my favorite CDs and I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates unique bands like AIR. I can't wait to go get Premiere Symptomes. Go out and buy it!"
5,Superb.,"What can I say about this album? It's superb. It's more than just an album, it's a mood. Subtle, evocative, fresh, mellow, and all around smooth. I have had this CD for over six months now and it still maintains MVP status in my CD carousel. It's difficult to find words to effectively express my appreciation for this CD. A perfect accompaniement to any aspect of one's day, particularly for driving, or quiet contemplative time at home. Perhaps one of the best CD's I've bought, EVER."
5,This is really good,"Kind of rare analog, melodic, jazzy groove. Downtempo and just darn good.This has become one of my alltime favorite albums and bands. It's rare to find such a good album and band. I'm a hard grader compared to most amazon folks and these 5 stars are really worth it."
1,EuroTrash-with emphasis on trash,"I became really excited while reading all the glowing reviews of this CD, and immediately I went out and purchased it. Being a musician and a composer, I'm always looking for new ideas and inspiration. I must say that I simply do not understand how anyone could think this is good music. Fortunately, the manager of the store where I bought it gave in to my persistent nagging and let me exchange it for something else (I got something by the Orb and was very relieved, even after hearing only the first few bars of that one). If your standard for what's excellent and relevant in music is high, then don't be fooled by all these 5 star reviews. On the other hand, if pure cheese is your thing, then go for it!"
4,Receiver Hitch Step,"Love this item...second one I bought. Purchased one for my Dodge Ram, then sold it, bought new Nissan Titan and wanted another receiver step, as I left the other one in the Ram I sold."
2,Recall this album before somebody gets sick!!!,"Yuck! The prior Panzer AG CD was way, way, way better. This album sounds like a rip off album of...I'm not shure who? Every radio band you can think of. The album cover is awesome, but most of the songs are lame. I hate the stupid songs like ""Tip The Dancer"", and ""The Monster under your bed"". If you loved the much better album (This Is My battlefield), than you'll probably hate this album. Total crapola."
2,Dying Chicken,"This chicken is simple enough. It's a plastic chicken. All it does however is shriek the most horrible sound of chicken death. I had no idea it would sound so bad until we got it. If that's funny to you, get it. The sound killed all the fun for me however."
2,Don't get it for your DOG,"Here's the thing. This chicken is not a soft rubber chicken. It's kind of a hard rubber and it's stuffed with some kind of weird poly cottony looking stuffing. Why do I know this? I know because my pups immediately bit a hole in the chicken's tail and began to ""kill the chicken"" and pull the stuffing out of it. If you have a dog that loves the soft rubber chickens without stuffing in them, this is NOT the bird for you. If you're looking for a hard rubber chicken with poly-whatever stuffing, knock yourself out. I will say this - the noise this chicken makes is hysterically funny. It's not a chirp. Heck, it's not even a cluck. That thing sounds like a dying chicken. VERY, VERRRRRRY FUNNY to hear. Not a bad product, just not a good product for my dogs - and I'm so cool that I actually bought two of the darn things hoping it was just what I'd been looking for. :sigh:"
5,Brilliant Analysis,"Fareed Zakaria turned my world upside down with this book. He proves the common misconception that democracy is the best solution to any problem, which is interesting in that everyone champions democracy but rarely wonders why it has failed so often (see all of Africa, minus South Africa). Zakaria's insight into the world of Islam is the most interesting part of this book. Two things which Zakaria called in advance of them actually happening: That Iraq would be an excellent place to instill democracy into the Arab world and that California's pure form of democracy was headed for an explosion (such as a recall). Great read.-Alec"
4,Old Hollywood Glamour,if your looking for book with old hollywood glamour picturesthis is the book for you. You cant go wrong 30+ photos of mostly dead actors and actresses
4,A fascinating but objective study of Second Sight,"This scholarly and thorough, but highly readable account, details historic and modern (up to the 1980s) instances of the Scottish Highland brand of precognition known as Second Sight. From St. Columba to modern-day Glaswegians, it covers the visions seen by seers that accurately foretold future events. This book should appeal to all lovers of Highland lore and the occult. It is both objective in tone and open-minded regarding its subject and is a refreshing source of information with enough spine-tingling details to keep the reader on the edge of his seat!"
3,A Puzzling Suspense Story,"This book is an enigma from the beginning. Nothing seems to be as it appears and you are left wondering are the good people evil; are the evil people good? Is Terry Painter,the protagonist really being threatened or drugged ,or is it all in her imagination ? Is Allison, her tenant, really a sweet woman or is she there to wreak havoc on Terry? The story moves along at a fast pace,albeit dragging occasionally with triteness.. The character development is good, but also contradictory in the portrayal of the various characters as the story develops.It is suspenseful, but often unbelievably so in some of the various events. The whole story leads up to a totally twisted, perhaps surprise, ending, which led me to rethink the whole book and wonder if the clues were there all along. Although well written, this is not one of Joy Fielding's better books."
2,Roller Coaster in the Dark,"This book was riveting, for sure. I love thrillers so I read it in an afternoon despite myself. But...there were few hints as to who would turn out to be the good guys and who were the bad guys.Good writing, even for popular ""good reads"", should have some foreshadowing, some clues as to how the story might resolve itself. This story ended with a bizarre twist that one could not have expected. I felt like I was riding a roller coaster in the dark, getting a whiplash ending.For those who like a thrilling, whiplash kind of read you may like this book. For those who want developed characters who act within character, go elsewhere for your thrillers."
2,"Three words: Disturbing, disconcerting, and unsettling.","I usually love Joy Fielding's books, but agree with the other negative reviewers about this one. I almost gave up on it early on but decided to stick it out since I've not had a negative experience with this author. Unfortunately, as it took the twist, it also became too disconcerting to enjoy."
1,O M G,I READ THE BOOK AND IT BECAME MY FAVORITE BOOK. I HAVE RECOMENDED IT TO MANY PPL AND THEY AGREE. YOU WONT REGRET GETTING IT. THE BOMB.
4,A twisting ride with Fielding.,"Joy Fielding brings us another great read. In Whispers and Lies, Terry Painter rents her cottage out back to Alison Simms. Her new roommate seems to good to be true and Terry and Allison become fast friends. However, is Alison here as a threat to Terry?Soon things in Alison life don't add up and Terry suspects that she isn't telling her the truth about her intentions. Terry paranoia gets the best of her as phone calls from a man start and someone always seems to be lurking in the shadows of her place. After Terry reads Alison diary, she is sure that Alison is a threat to her.This book takes you on a roller coaster ride from start to finish, twisting and turning and throwing everything you thought upside down. Enjoy the ride!"
2,Not really impressed..,"This is the first Joy Fielding book I've read. It was easy to get into, the characters likable enough, and the plot slowly (especially in the middle) developing. However, the last 20 or so pages Fielding decided to throw the reader into a loop of unpredictability and confusion...there being only slight, slight hints of anything pointing towards such an unbelievable twist. I think Fielding took excess liberties as the author and had a really good time writing this story, but unfairly put the reader into a spot I don't think I'd want to venture again. And for all you fans of happy endings...don't expect to read ""Whispers and Lies"" and gain any sort of peaceful, satisfying resolution. It's just not here."
4,Major Error in book,Triangle is an good read and would rate excellent but the author seems to have made a major mistake in his research. He has listed Ms Rose Freedman as one of the victims and even describes her death. Ms Freedman was the last survivor to die(15 February 2001)at the age of 107.
4,Was a great Christmas Gift.,"Was getting nervous about finding my wife's cologne in time for Christmas.Appreciated the price being right, and appreciated even more the shipment arriving a few days earlier than predicted."
1,BEWARE!,"I purchased 2 bottles of this parfume because of the totally incredible price. Be careful, this is a knock off. It is made somewhere in France. Read and reread all the information. I never saw that it was not the genuine product. I feel this was my own mistake. The parfume is well packaged and came bottled nicely but it is not Ellen Tracy. It also does not seem to last long on the skin. Great product for a younger girl. This is not a slam against the product but if you are looking to buy the real thing, leave it alone."
2,New Brand by Ellen Tracy,"I ordered Ellen Tracy by Ellen Tracy and I received New Brand by Ellen Tracy - the following is the response that I received from the company when I complained.*****We apologize that you are not completely satisfied with the item you received. However, all of our items are new and fresh in stock.

3,"Good, but not great.","I was so excited to read this after The Innocent, so of course it disappointed. It was much darker, which is okay, and it has a lot of twists, which is also okay, but with each twist he goes darker and darker. Dark for dark sake almost. But the story was still decent, and if you liked The Innocent it's worth the read."
4,page torner,"i love the Marconi stories, easy to read, yet great enough to definitly hold your interest.only one thing i would criticize - he tends to repeat story lines in separate novels. still gripping but you've already read that with someone else in the same prediciment."
2,Trite.,"Writing is amateur-ish. Full of unimaginitive cliches, with characters that don't even resemble something real. Lots of sexual innuendo that gets in the way of a potential story. Not for me."
4,Good Story,"This is the first book of his I have read. And it was just as suspenseful as I had hoped it would be. It didnt take long to get hooked into the story and characters. And the story kept moving at a great pace though out the book.The characters were complex but interesting and full of secrets that added to the story. Obviously you follow Keeper though the story. But why did seeing the man he thought killed his wife, keep him from getting married two years later. Why is this woman on the run in Mexico, and why is he hired to find her. What is the secret behind her book, Godchild. The book has almost constant twists and turns and new questions pop up almost as fast as old ones are answered. But though it all the reader never gets lost or left behind.This is a classic suspense story. And any lover of suspense novels should not miss it."
3,Worked great,"This pot worked great and was so simple. I made a steamed pudding and it got rave reviews.Small update -- this pot, while it makes great pudding, rusted terribly after the first use.I put it in the sink with water after it had cooled to let it soak overnight. There is now rust all over the lid, the bottom and sides of the pot. The rust would not disappear. What a disappointment."
1,Bogus offer,I ordered 2 Mold with 2 lids. I received 1 mold with 2 lids. There is no other way to ask for a solution. I got charged for two items when I can use only one and there is no other way to ask for recourse.
1,Mott Saves The Day,"I was at the Memorial Coliseum in Ft. Wayne, IN for the Christmas show featuring Kiss when the announcement was made that Kiss would not be playing because Paul Stanley was the only one who made it. The rest of the band was stranded in Toledo due to the storm. The crowd was informed that if they left now they would get a rain check on a later Kiss date but if they stayed and watched the show Mott and Ted Nugent would play and there would be no refund given. At that point half the crowd which was a full house cleared out. I stayed and watched Mott and Ted as well. The people who left never saw the great Mott who I thought was as heavy metal as they come. I still cherish this album and remember the 70's when I had such a time as this one!"
5,Great,Great pair of jeans. They are sized a little long. I normally wear a 34 but with these 32 is long enough.
5,GR2 Shocks on 91-95 MR2 turbo,"If you don't have sealed shocks then these will work. The pictures show gray shocks but I received black ones. I hope they're the same. Install was easy, no problems at all."
1,Smashed Social,"Sadly, a case of Social Teas arrived from Amazon in too many pieces. When I went to open the cookies most of them were cracked and broken into many pieces inside the original wrapper. Too bad, the price was nice, but getting smashed Social Teas in no fun at all!"
3,"We are different-We are the same - a review of ""A is for Africa""","As a mom of two I like to supply a variety of books for my children and I like this one as it has proven it's usefulness on a couple of levels.First, it can be used as an alphabet book; and second it can be used as apart of an Africa social studies unit.I particularly like that the pictures are upbeat and cheerful, all the while portraying a world that is very much unlike our own.And what do the children think? They like pouring over the pictures and wondering what kind of candies are on the table under the umbrella of the market trader. ;-)Three and a Half Stars. At these prices I think you might want to take a look at this book if you are looking for a super simple book on Africa. [And there's always the library.]"
3,It works,I was skeptical at first but it came free with a purchase I made for my phone. I do not get service in at my home location inside or outside. I put this in the phone and get service outside now. I still don't get it outside but it did boost the service signal outside to 2 bars when I had none before.
5,product does what i bought it for,product does what i bought it forproduct does what i bought it forproduct does what i bought it for
1,Doesn't work,"Doesn't work, I try to use it in a diferents parts or situations and doesn't work. I don't recomend this product"
1,"Simply doesn't work at all, don't waste your money","As title, it doesn't work at all...I've tried it in different phones, it just doesn't work. I noticed some people sell it for $5.00 a piece...if you don't mind to trow away money to trash can, feel free to use this product.Again, it doesn't work!!!!!!!"
1,Great Idea But Does Not Work :(,"The idea of a signal booster is a great idea, but you are lucky if it works. I read the reviews before buying and thought, hey maybe my phone would be different, maybe my service are would be different, but I am lucky if I get an extra bar and if you are in a building, home or basement, I do not get anything different than what I used to. It was cheap and at least I did not waste a lot of money, but still it would have been nice for it to work. Also installing it was a little fumbling jsut because of the way that it has to be stuck on. I would suggest to anyone buying this product to not, it just does not work."
1,junk,bought it hoping to gain signal but had the opposite result but it cost more to return it then i paid for it.
1,It's a sticker - (I purchased with no luck),"I bought this since at work I go in and out of service constantly and I was hoping for something like this to work. It did nothing sadly, I really wanted it to work. Also after reading the 5 star reviews I googled them and noticed that those reviews word for word had been used in many places. They sound real but sadly it's just marketing."
1,Didn't work,"I have a Virgin Mobile Rumor2. I used to get service indoors and then one day the signal got just weak enough that I had to leave my phone in a window to send out a text. I got this thing hoping to get that little bit of boost back, but it made zero difference."
1,Didn't work for me.,"My house has heavy interference and I normally get zero to one bar of signal strength. When I step right outside in front of my house, I would get normally two to three bars (Out of five). I have used this product before and on different areas of the phone....No changes whatsoever. I have three of them and for fun, I decided to paste all three on different areas of the battery compartment and it didn't do anything different. One didn't work and three certainly didn't change anything. I would definitely not recommend this product to anyone. I have read some reviews where it had worked but for me, personally, I saw no positive change in my signal strength."
1,CRAP!,"OK, so I bought into the claim that the little sticker works........more money down the drain... what a joke! This thing does nothing but stick to the phone. It is simply a piece of CRAP!!!"
1,doesn't work not worth it,people please that's why they are selling it cheap because they wan to get rid of this product it doesnt work its crap really don't waste your time.tested it on blackberry no difference.
1,Dissapointed,this item did not work at all.... This item should be discontinued. This items is only a way to take peoples money.
1,Don't waste your money,"This books is sorely lacking in real content. Yes - XBRL is based upon XML. Yes - XML definitions are available for financial statements. Yes - there are competing standards. Yes - XML is popular.There are no XBRL example in this 100+ page book. If you're looking for a real introduction to this topic, find it elsewhere. If you don't understand XML, ask someone or buy another book. Even though I bought a used copy of this book, it was a complete waste of money. The Title ""Essentials"" is terribly misleading. If you have a Dilbert-esk manager who is using an etch-a-sketch for a laptop, this book is for them. If you are actually reading the reviews on this book before purchasing it, you have already passed the intelligence test which disqualifies you from actually needing this book. Don't waste your money on this book.If all the books in this 'Essential Series' are also lacking in real content like this book, I would steer clear of those books too."
4,better than false start !,"the first post love release by this extraordinarily gifted all around figure is better than the last love album, 1970's false start. a wide range of styles as always: funk, soul, heavy metal, and hard blues in particular. the highlight is the amazing love jumped through my window, featuring some of lee's best vocals ever. otherwise its a quite solid although not spectacular album i.e. no bad tracks but relatively little that is truly memorable. other stellar tracks include everybody's gotta live and you want change for your rerun. this contains some alternate versions and also a rather ordinary remake of hendrix's easy rider. this solo album should certainly please lee's fans, but those expecting another forever changes ( maybe the greatest album ever in my opinion) will of course be disappointed."
4,Nice Picture,The picture quality is lovely on this print. The only gripe I have about it is the paper is kind of thin. This doesn't matter if it's in a frame but it means you're more likely to accidentally tear it in the process of putting it in one. And I would never recommend putting it on the wall without it being in a frame unless you laminate it.
4,Used with Samsung LN52A650,"I used this with a Samsung LN52A650 52"" LCD HDTV. Mounted very well and is very, very sturdy. Everything was easy, and overall the mounting process took no more than 30 minutes. Using the larger brackets the mount offered just enough clearance for the cables coming out of my TV (HDMI and component). Total clearance for cables (taking into account the input panel on the TV is set in a bit) is about 2.5 inches.I gave the product only 4 stars because I wish it had just one more set of holes for mounting the plate to the wall. I couldn't put the TV exactly where I wanted because I didn't want to have most of the weight on the entire right side of plate. I compromised and only have the TV about 2"" offset to the right. Most of this problem is due to the lousy positioning of the wall studs in my apartment though and not really with the mount itself."
3,flat screen low profile wall mount,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009JR42E/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titlevery easy to install.much cheaper than at the stores. arrived quickly
4,Easy to Install!,"Installed it in 1/2 an hour. Hung a 52in TV and it is only 2 inches away from the wall, amazing!"
2,NOt what I expected,"It's unlikely you will find this book, because it's out of print. I heard about it on the Compuserve Dog Forum, because co-author Marcy Heathman, was one of the forum moderators.Being owned by two pugs, I have become a pug paraphrenalia seeker, so this book was high on my list. However, I tho't this was a very specialized ""How to care for your pug"" type book. Instead, it is a history of some of the top bloodlines of the breed. If I were a serious pug breeder and exhibitor, this would be mandatory reading. I am not, nor do I ever intend to breed or show pugs.Also, the famous pugs listed in the book are ones who are either very old or deceased, and many other pugs are ommitted because the book was never updated (a Herculean task, I'm sure).SO, this book will probably eventually be a gift to a dedicated pug breeder/and dog show exhibitor some day."
1,Not as advertised,This is not the same book as the one with the red cover.No photos of Master Yip doing the form.
4,cool mp3,"I like this product alot even though I bought it a while back and have since purchased a MAC computer. Now I cannot download to this mp3 player. I bought myself an ipod shuffle (loving it) and my son is enjoying this mp3 now. Very simple to use. Enough storage capacity for my son, but you might want to up the mbs if you like to store alot of music. I used it for file storage as well. Never had a problem."
2,large ear buds/eats batteries quickly,"not only did the ear buds not fit in my ears but this thing eats the batteries so quickly (5 hours max). Also, it doesn't have any sort of clip attached to it. So even though it's inexpensive, count on spending at least another $25 on smaller buds and a case. i had to buy a cell phone clip on case so that i could wear this while working out - which is the only reason i purchased it."
1,There are more than one size,"After making the purchase and receiving it quickly, I tried to install it but it is the wrong size.I should have made the purchase at a local plumbing store where I would have purchased the correct size and had the job done."
3,black religious militancy,"Dr. Cone is brilliant in his narrative, but be prepared to deal with his hostility towards CaucasianChristianity. Getting his point of view is important, because he is a very strong advocate forthe black church in America, and he weaves his themes based on Biblical Scripture and basedon his utter rejection of the ""white"" Christianity."
1,Recipe for racism,"Black racism, embodied by this ""religion"", is no different that that put forth by the KKK. Skin color over religion dominates.I gave it a 1 star since someone took the time to write this trash and warn America just what Black Theology of Liberation is all about. The garbage spewed in this book is base on hate and fear. The other reason is that black orators then rake in lots of cash for the likes of Jeremiah Wright. Wright walks into his million plus house-with-elevator because his demonic rants implant hate and fear in his congregation.Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton learned long ago that racial hatred can be profitable."
5,Love it.,I bought this and am very pleased with it. The legs retract instead of shoot out lile with the harris bipod. Didnt like it at first but makes sense. I would buy another one if needed too.
1,Never got what I ordered,"So....amazon has this item listed as Shooters Ridge Bipod, but be aware you will receive a Champion Bipod. So, Amazon tried to ship me out a replacement order, but shipped me the same thing. I don't know anything about Champion gear so I just wanted what I ordered. Amazon refused helping me a third time to make it right. Bad customer service. They'll only help you once and expect you to return everything, get a refund, and re-buy...and go through it all again.WTF? If they don't have it, then I'll understand...but supposely it's in stock. MAKE IT RIGHT, thats all I wanted."
5,Solid Bi-Pod,I was extremey happy with the quality and price of this bi-pod. It has a good mount for the sling and the legs are spring loaded to retract when you're ready to fold it back in. Solid Bi-pod for the price!
4,Nice product.,"Very easy to attach and stays firmly attached while using a Savage 22lr MKII. My only regret about not holding one in my hand prior to the purchase is that I really wish it were 1-2"" longer. My bad. Good product."
5,The best thing written since the canon was closed.,"I first heard of The Singer Trilogy while working on my Master's degree at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. Dr. Calvin Miller, the author of the series, was the speaker for chapel services. The professor in my class before chapel said that Dr. Miller had written The Singer Triology which consists of The Singer, The Song, and The Finale. He said it was the best thing written since the canon was closed. I rightly understood this to mean this was the best thing written since the Bible.The Singer Triology is a retelling of New Testament events, including the ministry of Jesus and the founding of the early Church. The books are religious historical fiction. They are excellent and an easy read. They are a must for any Christian library. The series is as timeless as the Bible itself.All three books read and reviewed by Jimmie A. Kepler."
5,Beautiful analogy,A colleague introduced this book to me. I am reading it to my 5th gradersand they are enjoying the musicality even when they might not understandthe actual words. Many pick up on the representations of the stories inthe Bible. We like it.
2,Sizing not Accurate,"A very nice Jacket, what I was looking for, but the sizing was not correct. When I buy that size in a store it fits... from JR Stone it was at least two sizes too small.had to return it."
4,Chocolate is great -- cookie crumbly,"Apparently, I have been raised on the generic version of Mallomars, because this is the first time I have tried Mallomars. At first look, I did notice they were smaller -- maybe about the size of the covered oreo cookies. The marshmallow doesn't taste as sweet as the generic I've eaten for years and the cookie part seemed to crumble every time I would take a bite. So, I either dealt with the messy crumbs or shoved the whole cookie in my mouth at one time. As an adult, when I splurge and eat cookies, I want to savor them and make them last longer, so I prefer not to put the whole thing in my mouth. All that said, the chocolate on the Mallomars is out of this world!!! It is fantastic!!! I think the goodness of the chocolate almost completely counteracts the crumbly cookie. Yummy!!"
2,Melted Mallowmars,When I received my mallowmars unfortunately they had that white looking dusty glaze over them from getting somewhat melted and then re-hardened. They did not taste very good...they tasted kind of old. I was disappointed that I bought four boxes.
2,Not very good,"I remember these from childhood but I guess those memories aren't that accurate. These were very dry, poor quality chocolate and mediocre marshmallow. All combine to make an underwhelming product. There are other mass market products that are similar but better, such as the Pinwheels also from Nabisco. There are also very high quality versions out there from small, specialty manufacturers; chocolate teacakes from the UK, similar products from other countries (they all seem to have some variation on this theme) and there are even great recipes on the various food websites for the more adventuresome. Your kids may accept these as edible, but why not give them something better?"
3,Mallomars... the cookie of choice of Claudia Kishi!,"So, the only reason I requested these was because I have nostalgia for the Baby-Sitter's Club series by Ann M. Martin. Claudia Kishi, the vice-president of the BSC, was always referring to Mallomars and I don't know if my small Minnesota town just didn't have them when I was growing up but I have never had one. When I saw these on Vine, I had to get them for nothing but nostalgia. Fortunately, they weren't awful but they aren't something I'm going to buy on my own. If you like marshmallows, this may just be the cookie for you. The thin layer of chocolate coating gives these a distinct s'mores flavor which again, is kind of fun. These aren't an awful sweet treat but they aren't something I'm going to routinely reach for when I need a sweet fix. However, I'm glad to say I experienced something Claudia Kishi was always raving about."
3,Good but not great,"I'm not sure why I'm not crazy about these things. When I was a Girl Scout, I used to love s'mores so I thought it'd be the same deal. They have the crunchiness of graham crackers, the chocolate and the marshmallows though. I like them, but I'm just not in love with them. If I really needed a sweet tooth fix, they'd definitely work. I like the texture and taste of the chocolate though, but I'm wondering if maybe I'm outgrowing s'mores these days. I'll have to make use of my stove (or somebody's campfire) to find out."
2,Disappointed,"I remembered these cookies from when I was a kid and I was really looking forward to getting them. Unfortunately, the cookies arrived broken and the chocolate was white. I'm not sure what the problem was, but they did not taste good. I ate one an threw the box away. They did not taste very good."
5,yum,"Who wouldn't like these??They are fresh, soft and just so yummy.The chocolate is nice and creamy, rich and very fulfilling. Ladies, you know when you get that craving for chocolate? Well, 2 of these will do the job.These cookies only lasted 3 days in my house.We are big fans and I'm actually going to order more of them.They are a nice small size and perfect to flip into your mouth!Wonderful product"
5,Yum!!!,"I love marshmallow. I love dark chocolate. How on Earth is it possible that I had never tried Mallomars before? I don't know how, but they had managed to escape my radar for all these years. In case you haven't figured it out yet, I loved them. I loved everything from the rich, dark chocolate covering the cookie to the ooey gooey marshmallow on the inside. Not only did I love them, but both of my kids loved them too. I hate to admit it, but I selfishly wanted to stash them somewhere and not share. I did fight that urge however, and shared them with my family, but only because I know I will be buying my own secret stash soon enough."
2,San Francisco : with Fond Memories,I can not review this due to not knowing who the artists are that performed the songs. I've been looking for San Francisco Teardrops by Marty Robbins for months hoping for a free download actually.
1,Not a good book,"I did not like this book. It was so depressing. The best I can say is that the author does appear to be honest. She is caught up in her identity as a feminist and fails to figure out how to compromise and negotiate. In my opinion, while she is indeed very unhappy, she fails to see the part she herself plays in that state of mind. Another thing that bothered me, while she beat the reader over the head with images of the oppressed modern American mother, she totally failed to offer any solutions. All the book is, is depressing. I had hoped there would be some humor in it but there is not a single funny story in it. I am kind of shocked a company actually published it."
1,well written but WAY too self-absorbed and angry,"While I could relate to many of Fox's feelings on marriage, motherhood, and work, the intensity of her feelings and the anger behind all of it was far too much to take. Her husband sounds incredibly involved, but she trashes him mercilessly. Her kids sound like bright, engaging kids, but all she can do is talk about the drain on her time that they represent. This book could have been saved by humor, but instead it is a relentlessly bleak, dark, and resentful tirade. How is she going to feel when her kids are teenagers and they read the book? For that matter, are other people's feelings important to her at all? Or just her own? A complete downer..."
2,Whiny entitled mom rants too much,The first part of this book is kind of interesting. But then the editor must have fallen asleep on the job. The author doesn't keep the reader's perspective in mind as it reads like the rant of a whiny and entitled woman and mom. It's too personal to be interesting to the everyday mom.I can't feel empathy for her and I wouldn't recommend the book.
4,Sending Signals,"Dispatches is a book that should have a wider audience than parents. Fox, through her examination of her family and life, touches on issues as how we define and value ourselves and those around us. The book is funny, not so much laugh-out-loud funny but of a kind derived from recognizing our idiocyncratic personalities as part of a larger truth about human foibles and the messiness of life. Fox is inquisitive, and challenging of herself and others never settling for the status quo. If the messages of Dispatches sometimes fail to reach its intended audience it is partly because of the strong emotions and protective urges that it arouses. Nevertheless Dispatches is always thought provoking, as it focuses on the conflicting emotions of loving those around you while feeling alone and at a loss of self. All this and also snip-its of oddball types such as the ""Rush""(the rock band)-loving Warlock float in and out of Fox's account making it hard to put down."
5,One of my favs,"I was lucky to have stumbled on the english version in my dad's book collection a long time ago. The writing is as beautiful as the other reviewers have mentioned. I wish more people could be exposed to this version of Haiti. I've only been to Haiti when I was very young so I have no real memories of it, but when I compare this novel to stories from older family members it feels like Jacques Roumain really captured the essence of Haiti in this work."
4,A Bit of Editing Needed,"This Will Staeger book was a fun, fast paced read. However, someone with a naval background should have been an editor. Chapter 24 opens with the phrase ""....Travis Malloy was a private in the U.S. Navy...."" Junior enlisted personnel in the navy are generally seamen (airmen if in Naval Aviation).Further in this chapter Stager discusses sending the marines after an AWOL character. For a simple AWOL (UA in navy & marine jargon), the Shore Patrol would have been used. For more serious crimes, I believe the N.C.I.S. would be called. The marines would not be used as a police agency for the navy (except for such ""Police Actions"" as Korea)."
4,Famous old climbing bourbon,"Zephrine is a climbing Bourbon no old garden rose lover would be without. It is best trained on a wall that gets plenty of sun. There is a slight tendency to mildew and blackspot, but the rewards of having this wolderful old rose compensate for any slight inconvenience to the grower. In a good location, with plenty of air and sun, Zephrine will gove a wonderful display of cerise colored, fragrant blooms for many years to come. This rose throws out long, flexible canes and is easily trained to climb a trelis, fence or wall. I only wish Spring Hill would also offer the two color sports, Kathleen Harrop and Martha. Zephrine and her progeny are thornless."
3,Color is off..,"While this collar fits my puppy well, the color of the collar displayed is misleading. What arrived was a hunter green collar."
5,Bluegrass Banjo,"A great book. Takes you step by step through how to learn banjo. It doesn't teach you very many songs, but it does teach all the techniques you need."
4,RAIN GAGE REVIEW,"HOW DO I MOUNT IT? SINCE IT WILL BE USED OUTDOORS, HOW DURABLE IS IT? What is it made of? WILL IT REMAIN CLEAR OVER TIME SO I CAN READILY SEE THE RAIN LEVEL? PRICE IS RIGHT , BUT HOW LONG WILL IT LAST?"
3,Just an Introduction,"The book is very much an introduction, but not as good as those ""blank for dummies books."" It reads as if you entered the front door, then a second later, turn around and are back in the hall way. The chapters are short and simple. The actual philosophical and theological concepts are reduced to sentences. If anyone were to read this book believing it's the movement's intellectual history, they would be disappointed.Perhaps the greatest contribution towards reconstruction's theory is Judaism as a Civilization by Kaplan, a good primary source that shows the movement through the founder's eyes.I would recommend it for someone who wants a quick introduction without the difficulty of theological perspectives."
2,flimsy with mis-aligned screw set,"I give this 2 stars because the door knob portion is actually nice and heavy. The rest of the unit is pretty much useless, particularly for something like a storm door. I used it on a regular sized door and could never get the screws to catch without hitting the latch and causing the unit to stick after several uses . I finally ended up installing a deadbolt for security and using this unit as a ""dummy pair"" just to pull and push the door open and closed-- basically it is just useful as a handle."
1,Not a good unit,"Bought and threw away the same day. Installed easy enough, but the knob part wouldn't function to open the door with the latch. The knob was apparently defective inside and would turn around the bushing that it should have been secured to. After several attempts to get it to work the knob separated from the bushing making it useless.Wouldn't advise buying this unit."
2,Junk,"Another American ""value"" product.In less than 18 months I've been through three of these. Unfortunately the door is drilled for its spacing and I'm sort of stuck with it.For those intrepid soles willing to drill out their door and install one, here's a few pointers.Drill a 1/2"" hole as the 5/8"" called for simply let's it move off axis too much. You door is the spindles support, not the flimsy latch.File out the bottom of the estucheon plates to allow drainage. Otherwise they will fill with water and streak (eventually rot) the door. Not to mention reduce the sping life to a matter of months.Grease the assembly liberally before mounting.Replace the knob set screws with better ones. Or, apply locktite and tighten lightly. The heads break.Don't tighten the knobs against the estucheon plates. Leave about 1/16"" for play as the knobs bind when turned."
3,a nice story,"This was a nice story but really not that interesting at all...the style of the film is nice, the actress who is Marilyn does a convincing job but that's all the take away that I got....."
5,Excellent movie,Untold story of one week in the life of Marilyn Monroe. Extremely well acted......Michelle Williams was excellent as Marilyn.Would recommend.
2,brilliant Michelle Williams can't save this dull movie,"Beyond the shadow of a doubt Michelle Williams is brilliant in her portrayal of Marilyn Monroe. The movie itself is so slow and plodding that that brilliance is wasted. I'm sorry but I've never understood the onscreen appeal of Kenneth Branagh (nor Laurence Olivier bar his roles in Marathon Man and Boys From Brazil--both with Nazi themes so Freudians have a field day with that). Sure, Branagh is a great Shakespearean actor but, sorry, I don't get him at all.The young lad who falls for Marilyn is also less than convincing in that crucial role.The DVD extra, for myself, was far more fascinating intersplicing actual clips from 1957 when the movie (The Prince And The Pauper) around which this movie is based was being filmed."
4,Realistic,"portrait of a lonely and insecure woman ascending to a Chaplin or Elvis level of fame. Casting couches, unsupportive husbands, demanding directors, and nonstop alcohol and pills had made her life chaos. It's a firsthand account by a young man who may have shared her last peaceful days and found a simple woman who could have been happy under different circumstances."
2,Great movie but poor quality,"I loved this movie and I thought it was great. The problem is the quality coming from the Amazon stream. I have a HD TV and the quality of the stream was very poor. Since I've streamed from Netflix and Hulu, I know this is because of Amazon and not because of my equipment. I won't stream again from them!"
4,Really GOOD movie!,Michelle Williams is INCREDIBLE as Marilyn Monroe. Her performance is terrific. You feel like you're really watching Marilyn acting in a movie. It's a very interesting movie and found out some things about Marilyn that I didn't know before. Definitely catch this film!
5,Our hour and a half with Marilyn,"I inserted this DVD into my player with no real expectations one way or the other. However, I experienced something with the first scene with Michelle Williams as Marilyn and I was lost in the film until the final credits. I have no idea whether the portrayal was truly accurate or not, but I was lost in it because it seemed real. I had the feeling of understanding Marilyn better for having seen this.One doesn't need to be a Marilyn Monroe fan to see and enjoy this. However, I for one left this film with the feeling that Marilyn Monroe was a person truly worth knowing and I thank all those connected with the film for giving us the feeling of having known her better."
3,over-rat-ed,I bought this movie for a girl but I still thought that it was extremely overrated. I never really thought I was watching Mariyn. I felt like I was watching Dawson Creek. She got nominated for this role. I don't understand how. I would call it a dump on a plate.
2,Disappointed in movie,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. When I watched it I was REALLY disappointed. Michelle Williams performance was outstanding. It took so long to lay the foundation for the movie, I found it boringggggggg."
5,"Great Movie, Williams did a flawless job!!",I went in to this movie not knowing what to expect. I did find that it was an amazing movie that I think would be hard to fill the shoes of Marilyn Monroe in the first place but I think Williams did an amazing job and her voice and her physical appearance just made it so much more real. Seeing this movie made me want to know more information on Marilyn Monroe and I have more respect for Michelle Williams because of her strong role in this great film!
1,The Most Boring Book I Read In 2003!!!,"This HAS to be a joke right? I mean, the book starts off okay but, it got stuck on racial issues and it stayed there throughout 400 PAINFUL and yes, I mean PAINFUL pages. This book could have easily ended after page 200. I mean, if the author had ANY compassion for his readers, he could have granted his readers that, couldn't he? I was never a fan of Omar Tyree to begin with, but, if this is the kind of crap he's going to write as The Urban Griot, he might as well make this his last book ever! This is the time I wished that Amazon.com had a ""zero stars"" option but I'm being forced to give this total waste of time 1 star."
5,good book,This is a very god book with information that has biblical refrences to back up what they are saying. I loved reading the book and learned from it.
4,Cute story,"This is a really cute story (was a family favorite over the years), I'm surprised it's out of print (I bought it used)."
3,"Good, but too short","Some very good info, but this book is way to short. It's only 75 pages and is extremely small. The content it does have is very good though. If you are looking for something you can read fast and get something out of then this is the book for you. If you are looking for something more in depth, I would recomend you look elsewhere. Also I can't believe they charged so much for such a small book."
5,Very satisfied,Prompt delivery and the correct item. I am very satisfied with the quality of the part. My car is working just fine and there are no flaws
5,Way Out West '- The Gift,"This is the track that brought Way Out West fame, and no wonder: it's a stunner. With a sample of Joanna Law singing the famous Robert Flack tune ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,"" Way Out West craft an emotive piece of songcraft that's equally suited for the dancefloor as well as for simply watching the moon and the stars hand-in-hand with your lover. The ""Club Mix"" emphasizes the beats a bit more, bringing in a four-on-the-floor to accompany the breaks, but the original still rings out crystal clear in its clarity and beauty."
5,A beautiful light.,"Dondestan is one my favorit record. I did not know Mister Wyatt before hearing it, a few years ago, and found it a little strange at the begginig. Strange enough, anyway, to listen to it again, and again, and again... More than music, this is pure light; and some kind of incredible one, deeply white and generous. I always wear sunglasses while listening ro it."
4,Good product but bad price,This is an excellent product and I use it daily but the price here is awful. I recommend you check out your local whole foods first. It typically sells around $5 to $6.
4,Yeast Goodness,"I like this very much on certain foods such as popcorn and pasta. It is a nice addition but not an essential one. If it didn't have nutritional value, I would probably skip it entirely. But since it does add value, in terms of nutrition and has a nice flavor, I suppose for someone seeking out a brand of Nutritional Yeast you could do a lot worse than this one."
4,Animal Crossing = awesome,This game is awesome!!! You first arive at a town and work for this raccoon dude and you own a house and you have to pay a morgage for making your house bigger. you can sell stuff to make money.its so awesome!!! heres the product:Animal Crossing DS
5,"Very good, abit like Zelda and Sims put together.","Its a very good game, shame about the wi-fi though (because it perimeter isnt very far, only like 12 metres.)A very good game, but after a while playing on it, it can get boring as you do the same thing everyday, but yes its a very enjoyable game, best of nintendo ds so far."
4,DS or GCN?,"So everyone knows that this is the sequel to the GCN version.And there are many differences between them too. Like in the DS version one of the main downfalls is the dissapearance of the classic NES games from the GCN. There are many advantages and disadvantages. One of the main good things is the new equipment. Like the slingshot and watering can. There are many differences but some of the main pluses sre as follows:EquipmentAccessoriesHeadgearNew writing systemWireless connectionBut another minus is the lack of holidays like Christmas, Halloween, and Thanksgiving in order to make the game ""universal""."
1,Nothing to-do in this game,"There is almost nothing to-do in this game at all. I really wanted to like this game, but it's just terrible. I gave it to my girlfriend, and she agreed that there is nothing to-do in this game.To any one thinking of purchasing this game, I recommend Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town. Harvest moon has a similar idea to this game, but actually has very good (although nothing groundbreaking) game play, with tons of events to continually keep you playing."
1,Teaches kids to either give into bullies or pay the consequences!,"I bought this for my 10 year old daughter and after a month or 2 she met this Resetti character. He's a total bully that, if you do not allow yourself to be bullied he will call you (or your child) names such as ""dumb"", ""dirt"" and ""loser"". Not only is this terrible for a child's self-esteem but teaches children to be rude, insensitive and defensive or else submissive to bad characters. I cannot believe that Nintendo came out with this character on ANY game, much less one that is rated E. With the crime rate & other problems being what it is in this country this is not the types of behaviors and characters I want to passively expose my child to, which will desentitize her and teach her that this kind of communication is normal and acceptable."
1,"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE!!!","This is one of the WORST games I have ever played for the DS. Don't waste your money like I did. After three hours of mindless tasks and insanely boring interactions with the local denizens of my self-titled town, I realized that the game was NOT going to get any better, and that the thirty bucks I plunked down for a used copy could have been much better spent paying a homeless man to sing sea shanties for half an hour.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS NONSENSE!"
5,Nintendo DS Animal Game,Great game! My daughter loves it! Would recommend highly to those who love animals.
2,"Hard, Confusing, Not Much Replay Value",So I am a HUGE fan of Samus and the whole Metroid franchise. But this game fell off big time for me!!First the controls are just out of wack for me! They just didn't work for me! The bosses are the same (your fighting a stick or a ball that gets harder when you go to a different planet) But what made this game terrible for me had to be......NO SAVE STATIONS!!!! That was a huge mistake for this game! If you died you had to start all the way back at your ship which fustrated me to no end!! There is no replay value for me! Hopefully the next Metroid DS game will be better!
5,People who like halo will like this,"Okay, this is a review from a ten year old. Now before you go to the next review read this. This is a great game for halo people because of the first person shooter. Now the story goes like this: you get a message to go and find ""this ultimate power"". And your not the only one to look for it. There are other bounty hunters that look for it and of course you have to battle them. You have to find these big diamonds called octoliths to unlock the secret world oubliette. There you battle Gorea who was locked there by this group of aliens. Now if you do this curtain thing while battling him who obtain the secret power and battle him again with it. Unfortunatly, this is the only time you can use this power. Well then you beat the game. So, in conclusion, I highly reccomend this game. I hope I helped!"
5,This is a BRILLIANT single!,Angels: One of the best songs of the 90's without a doubt-a pop masterpiece!Back For Good (live): Anyone who knows Take That and Robbie's whole 'story' will get a kick out of his um...reworking of this tune.Walk This Sleigh: All I have to say...now THIS is a christmas song!
1,Definitely not Laura Pausini,"This CD is completely different to what we would expect from Laura given her two initial albums (Laura Pausini and Las Cosas Que Vives). Truly dissapointed. If I want to hear Selena type music, I would go and buy a Selena CD. However, there are one or two songs that are similar to her previous ones. Out of 13, very dissapointing. Plus an english song. Please!!!"
4,A surprising change of pace for Laura!,"With ""Mi Respuesta"" Laura Pausini goes the R&B route. I must say that I was quite taken aback at first but after listening to the CD for the third or fourth time it started to grow on me. The CD seems somewhat overproduced at times with excessive drum loops and synths. Laura's angelic voice and the strength of the lyrics more than make up for the producer's excessive zeal on this project. Laura is always at her best on the power ballads. Mmmmmm, yeaaaaaahhh! Bottom line, ""Mi Respuesta"" is a must for any true Laura Pausini fan."
2,bad wheels,"My 2 year old got frustrated with this stroller right away. The front wheels do not work- they slide sideways and dont roll. She found this very irritating. Its cute otherwise but it doesn't roll correctly. A child would just have to push it along the floor, scraping along not rolling. Designers need to improve the wheels."
3,Average Cd.,I like Jennifer. This is a good Cd. Not the best but good. I know this doesn't involve her music but doesn't anyone else notice that with each new album she loses a bit more clothing. It's off putting. I used to think of her as classy and still do. I just hope she doesn't become an Hispanic Britney.
4,Excellent coverage of basic principles,"If I were to pick one short (127 page) book for the person who knows how the pieces move and wants to know, ""what do I do next?"" this would be it. Three principles to guide opening play, four for the middlegame, and three for the endgame. The author provides plenty of exercises for practice. Someone looking for a meatier text would be advised to take a look at ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to Chess,"" by Patrick Wolff, but King covers the essentials quite well for those who just want to play a reasonable looking game, or get some ideas for teaching a child."
5,a man called mr pentecost,I really enjoyed the book and the inspiration it gave me i look forward to applying certain things that really struck a cord
5,Stuck in my head,"I could not get the song out of my head, so I bought it for the Amazon Cloud. Now I can play it at work when I need a little lift."
1,"buyer beware - not original version of ""Steamroller""","Amazon's MP3 version of this album is not identical to the CD version. The 4th track, ""Steamroller"" is the live version from his ""Greatest Hits"" album recorded in August 1975. If you want the original version of this song, buy the CD or get it on iTunes."
4,Nice Cross Section - R&R and Ballad; Two Singles Hits,"I found the music to be quite enjoyable, not his best by any means, but a good early album. Now that he has a string of hits, purchasing a greatest hits album might be a better choice. This album has only two singles that charted on the Billboard 100: ""Country Road"" and ""Fire and Rain""; however, Steamroller has certainly been a popular tune."
4,"Where is the origonal ""Steamroller""","This was probably the first LP I ever bought. I played the grooves out of it. I bought it recently as an MP3 from Amazon, because I was away from home and wanted something to mellow out.What I found is that one of my favorite songs of all time is Steamroller Blues by James Taylor. However... This is NOT the original version. This is the LIVE version from a much later album. It is the ONLY live song on the entire download. And I KNOW... the original album had a real tasty bluesy Steamroller.What is up Amazon???"
2,"Great music, awful dvd","Ok, i have to start by saying I really love Dire Straits and a few few of their songs are in my all time top 10 favourites.I recently received a couple of Pink Floyd DVDs and wanted the same with Dire Straits...What a disappointment! The sound quality is awful. It is not regular and volume changes several times in the same song, as if the sound was sometimes ""muffled""... And this is with very very good video and sound equipment. I would say 5 stars for the music and between 0 and 1 star for the DVD.My advice: Buy the CD instead. The DVD only brings frustration and anger about such fantastic music being wasted.Oh, how much I wish we had something from them in Blu Ray..."
1,Boring Madonna!,This is the worst Madonna's album. Don't waste your money on this. Ray of light & Music were about something! This is ridiculous.
2,Mediocre,"This is very average sounding. Nothing to write home about. Nothing fails, Love Profusion, title Track, etc. have that horrible electronica sound. Madonna sounds flat as well. Her whole look lately is freaky. She's looking way, way too Mannish."
3,american life,"i still believe this is the wors song Madonna has released as a lead single from an album. it just didn't work! however, the Oakenfold, Felix, and Rauhofer Anthem Part 2 do WONDERS for the song. I truly feel that the Oakenfold mix should have been the album and radio version. It actually makes the track seem coherent unlike the album version which sounds like a cut-and-paste MESS. The Missy remix is just as bad. The bonus mix of Die Another Day is AWESOME. Hupmty is one of the best remixers to tackle Madonna. check out his other M remixes."
3,Give it a chance,"You have to listen to the album more than once. With all of the techie blips and vocal tricks, it can get a bit distracting. American Life (the song) was too much like Die Another Day and with the video and the war happening, it got buried at radio. It deserved better. Hollywood was not a strong choice for the second single. The best songs are Nothing Fails (great ballad - but skip the remix version on her EP), Nobody Knows Me, Mother & Father, and Love Profusion (all great dance songs). Of course, Die Another Day is great too, but it's the soundtrack version which goes on a bit longer than the single version."
5,Great Change!!,"This album is great! and many people agree with me, Just Buy it. The bad thing? There are?My favorites....- Mother and Father- American Life- Nothing Fails- Hollywood- Nobody Knows Me- Easy Ride- I'm So Stupid"
1,Sanctimonious and disappointing,"As a Madonna fan, especially of her last two albums, I was highly anticipating this album. However, I found the cultural criticism misplaced -- the implication that America is far too materialistic is hypocritical when she urges us to buy her album -- not download free mp3's from her CD. Some songs, such as American Life, are occasionally interesting, but, somehow, such as in her 'rap' or being Madonna ""unplugged"" in several underwhelming acoustic numbers, she embarrasses herself. The reasons why this album is inadequate are not so clear; whether the lyrics are faulty, the music is less than perfect, or Madonna has simply lived so long outside the everyday world of most people she can no longer relate (evidenced by her ""three nannies and a chef"", etc.) are all viable culprits. Unfortunately, unlike the sonic vistas she took us to in ""Ray of Light"" and ""Music"", this album is not nearly as beautiful or as interesting."
1,"Musically a boring album, but...","I'm not a Madonna fan, however I truly loved the ""Ray Of Light"" album that was released in 1998. When the ""American Life"" title track was played on radios back in April 2003, at first I thought it was another artist who took the name ""Madonna"" and recorded this tuneless song. Lately when I realized that it was the same Madonna who sang both ""Ray Of Light"" and ""American Life"", I was like ""what the hell happened to her?"". I just couldn't believe that the artist who wrote such haunting songs like ""Skin"" and ""The Power Of Good-Bye"" could be as minimalist as her. Fortunately the album is lyrically OK, indeed ""American Life"" is an interesting CD, as far as lyrics are concerned, especially the first three tracks that deal with the North-American lifestyle. Hopefully she will stop working with music rookie Mirwais."
3,the REAL reason it didnt sell well...,was because 2003 was THE year that downloading broke BIG. You only have to read the customer reviews to see that at least 90% of big M's fans loved this album. everyone had this album a week before it came out and it effected record sales big time. Now were at the point wear the playing field has evend out and I expect COADF to be huge. Its allready leaked to the net and I have it. And yes I plan on buying it when Its released. Its amazing.
2,AL Reviewed,"madonna is neither a good or bad singer. Her voice is like every Tom, Dick and Harry--average.'Nothing fails' is the best track on here. Has a decent beat, if only lacking in good lyricism.Otherwise AL is neither adventurous or terribly bad. Just average enough to earn 2 Stars."
1,Very Disappointed Madonna Fan,"I've been a true Madonna fan since she had some her first hits like Everybody, Physical Attraction, and Holiday in the 80's.For me, my favorite music from Madonna ranged from dance, pop and ballad. Throughout the years her music has progressed with the times and she always managed to come up with a hit. She always had that ability as an artist.Unfortunately, this album, in my opinion, is probably one of her worst albums to date. I purchased it and found myself skipping each track in hopes of finding something that sounded anything like Die Another Day. Boy was I disappointed. I honestly tried to listen to the entire cd one day in my car, and just couldn't. It wasn't anything I wanted to hear. When I buy a new cd I usually like at least more than one of it's tracks - this one was a failure. It just sounded like Madonna trying to re-invent herself again but with bad music.Her Music cd was much better, and I must admit I was hoping to hear more of that music on this cd."
1,Madonna is a Putrid Puppy,"Not only is Madonna sick -- groping and kissing young girls half her age, but her music wreaks to high heaven. She should be locked up in a cell with other sick puppies like herself."
2,As Dull As a Dill Pickle,"madonna is ok for her dance music, but I gave A.L. a listen, and it landed at one of my garage sales last summer. Plus, her fans are sadly pathetic. Manny(I say that now, because she looks very butch), is over botoxed and over the hill."
2,This Album Lacks Punch,I was a fan of Madonna's back in 1985. I thought she had some good dance music back then. I lost interest after 1987. I moved on...I gravitated to deeper lyrics - that were more meaningful. And got into edgier sounds and artists. I thought I would give her latest a try. But it still lacks any real emotional depth. Her voice is still thin and she strains too hard to sing the higher notes. I listened to it once or twice and sold it for a buck at a rummage sale.
2,Not for those who liked the Ray of Light,"This CD is totally different. Broken rythms, different lyrics, no consistent good melodies. Bits and pieces thrown in together. If you liked solid tracks on the Ray of Light you will not like this album at all. Wait for nice remixes instead."
3,It's too bad that Amazon doesn't allow 1/2 star-ratings!,"If it did, I would probably give Madonna's latest a 3.5 rating. ""American Life"" is more like a cross between ""Music"" and ""Ray of Light"", jockeying an uneven blend of electronica and pop.The Material Girl's lyrics, especially on the title cut, ""Hollywood"", and ""I'm So Stupid"" are rather contradictory. How can one be critical of celebrity, as she seems to be when that is the very nature of her success? Is this more mature Madonna biting the proverbial hand that fed her so many years?I hope not.It appears that there are two camps of Madonna fans: those that think that she can do no wrong and those that try to psychoanalyze and scrutinize every aspect of the singer's character.""American Idol"" may be the first Madonna disc to satisfy both contingencies."
5,do me and madonna a favour americans,"in the words of madonna ""f--- it"" and buy this CD and you'll be surprised"
1,Horrible,"I USED to be a big Madonna with albums like Like A Virgin,True Blue,Like A Prayer,and Ray Of Light....Did she fall on her head before making this crap...There are not hit singles here and no good songs at all..This album debuted at #1 I don't see how...But after only 1 week it dropped to #10 and so on...Do not get this Madonna album"
2,Moledonna Makes William Hung look Talented,Moledonna sings like she has a bad case of Diarrhea. I recommend a dose of immodium and a permanent break from putting out substandard garbage like this.
2,American Life Was A Poor Seller...But Who Cares,And who cares if madonna isn't getting played on the radio any more. She's unfortunately kind of old looking. But at least she's trying. Gotta give her credit for that.Everything seems to come so easily for Britney Spears...every song she puts out is a radio smash...and that's not fair.
2,Thousands of tickets going unsold as well as the A.L. CD,"Concert promoters are actually in a frenzy over the thousands of tickets going Unsold for madonna's MSG gig, according to NY Daily News. Infact, they've had to drastically reduce ticket prices, in exchange for having to dispose of them. Once very pricey, now at 50.00 or less, for some seats, and people are still not interested. A.L. has also headed into irrelavant territory as the singer herself. She looks to be desperate for the fame she once had. She should be kissing the ground for just having a career, instead of much more successful singer these days, Britney Spears. madonna's not only one of the worst singer's in history of pop music, she's also the worst actress of the century as voted by movieline Mag., and box office poison."
1,A fart sounds better than madonna,"Her nose looks like a bird's beak, and she has a lantern jaw, and on top of that she's wrinkly and pruned faced. Oh, yeah, American Life smells really really baaaad!"
2,Mummydonna Strikes Out-- Again,"Call it The return of the living dread- Mummydonna. I guess you can have a career based on a classless reputation, zero singing and acting skills, and arms bigger than Arnold S' and the Incredible Hulk's combined. That is if you are desperate enough to want to stay in the spotlight no matter how dreadful a performer you are. Btw, I gave her an extra star just for that."
1,Your Ray of Light has faded...,"When 'Ray of Light' emerged - it was a new Madonna. Then 'Music' came out - another new Madonna. Now, 'American Life' is released - you might as well listen to Music and make up your own lyrics. No new Madona here!! This album began to get on my nerves early on and after one full listen, I turned my back on the Material Girl. What happened? Were these extra tracks left over from the last CD? Did the movie 'Swept Away' sweep your creative juices aside? Has motherhood changed you that much? My advice - save your money."
1,Sadly- Madonna can't sing,"Madonna's pathetic singing voice makes Britney Spears sound like opera singer Beverly Sills. She's a below average vocalist making a mockery out of pop music by trying to shock us once again--only this time she fails, and miserably so. Frankly, I wouldn't walk across the street to see her sing for ""Free."""
1,Best Avril Lavigne CD ever!!!!!,"I have never been this depressed in my entire life. Who wrote these lyrics, Hillary Clinton????""I'm drinking a soy latte, I get a double shot-tay, it goes right through my body and you know I'm satisfied""- It's worth it just to hear this line.""I'd like to express my own point of view, I'm not a Christian and I'm not a Jew""- Yeah, we pretty much figured that out, M.""Push the button, don't push the button""- Make up your damn mind, Madonna!""I'm not myself when you go quiet, I'm not myself alone at night""- (Don't ask)Yeah, don't blame her awful rapping attempt for this trainwreck. There isn't one good song on this at all. I actually got laughed at for trying to do the song ""American Life"" at Karaoke.I've tried so many times to like this CD. Really. If it hadn't been for ""Confessions On A Dance Floor"", her career would have been a complete and utter trainwreck. All the songs are contrived to the point where they sound exactly the same.Yup, this stinks pretty bad."
2,Madge Takes A Stab At Realism and Fails....,"Time to go back to the empty-headed pop fare she is known for. She tries to be taken seriously on A.L...but unfortunately the results are half-baked pop tunes with a potpourri of electronica and rap, no less. Madge needs to leave the rappin' to Lil Kim and Missy Elliot. When you're not blessed with a great singing voice like Madonna, and have a very limited vocal range, then it's best to go back to the dance songs."
1,this sux TOO MUCH,its sad to say that the woman who must be bigger than life has now succumbed to making bad music....her previous album ' MUSIC ' sucked and to release this one SUCKS more...im not sure how the album did internationally but here its obvious its AWFUL MADONNA MATERIAL...im not sure wether to laugh at her or to let her lean on my shoulder for releasing this album nevermind the previous one too
2,It's Mandonna's 'The Muscle Man's' American Stinker,"This album stinks to high heaven. What a no-talent wannabe Madonna is. This is a dreadful attempt for Manny keep up with her much younger contempories. But...the results are laughable. A rapping Mandonna...now, that is amusing."
2,It's just OK..,"I can't give this record more than 2 stars. Madonna isn't that great of a singer. Her music was pretty decent at one time. Even though she never had a real singer's voice--just 1 octave. But her songs at least were danceable, if not lightweight fare. Too bad she couldn't repeat that on AL. It's just mediocre and nothing special. It's pretty boring to listen to. It's now stored in the very back of my CD collection.."
3,Is that Patty Hearst on the CD cover?!?!?,"The music is a little bit better than average on most tracks, but most of it is hardly danceable. After the 3rd listen, I have to admit, I hummed a little. But the lyrics are enough to send you screaming out of the room or into road rage if you're in traffic. If Madonna has to perform a lyrical rehash of her less than perfect childhood and her approach/avoidance conflicts with fame and fortune once again, then she should ditch Kabala and seek counsel from Cher and Tina Turner. Get over it! I love Madonna dearly, but I really want to slap her face this time."
2,Needs Much better Songs and Vocals,"Ok voice, ok songs. I was non too impressed.I prefer much deeper lyrics, better songs and a much stronger vocal range, a la an Annie Lennox and Sarah M., Ms. True Colors herself and the Queen of Soul."
4,LISTEN TO THE MUSIC...,"Panned by critics, 'American Life' was the wrong album at the wrong time. Over the years Madonna's message and heartfelt lyrics have been overshadowed by her image. The AL video, and war images overtook what is a pretty great album. American Life is another example of some great lyrical content which was overlooked by the general public. Ok, so it was a stretch for her to rap about driving her mini cooper while feeling super dooper, but I digress. Listen to ""Nothing Fails"", ""Xstatic Process"", or ""Mother and Father"". Deep, meaniningful, and thoughtful. Then there is the dancy ""Nobody Knows Me"" which has a great beat. Overall, not her best work, but still original Madonna. CHECK IT OUT...."
2,"She's in decline, again","After Bedtime Stories, she came back with Ray of Light. We sighed with relief. Now she's lost it again. Beep beep beep and an over electronic voice. Simple arrangements. Poor, poor, unsophisticated music. If you want the best of Madonna: Like A prayer, Erotica, Ray of Light."
4,Worth the Money,"Madonna has again given us some great music to listen too. The album does take an open mind to be enjoyed fully. This album is not a dance album it is very introspective and hearfelt. This album is ""calmer"" than say the ""Music"" album.My favorite track is ""Nobody Knows Me"" which should have been the lead single. It is pure fun and has killer beats. I hope it it is the second single because it would be a big hit. Other favorites include ""Die Another Day"", ""Nothing Fails"", ""X-Static Process"", ""Love Profusion"", and ""Intervention"". The weaker tracks include ""I'm So Stupid"", and ""Full Circle"" and the not so good title track-""American Life"". But the American Life remixes are much better than the original song.This is not my favorite Madonna album because it lacks the pure fun of earlier albums. If that is what you are seeking stick to Bedtime Stories (amazing album),""Music"", and ""The Immaculate Collection"
1,Dont buy this crap,"These days, Maddy fans are so ashamed admit being a fan in the open. They seem to cringe upon hearing the name of their idol being uttered in public places. Ha ha ha!!! Good for them!As for this album? Its stupid! Dont buy this crap. Its just not worth it, better watch her shows full of visuals, atleast you delight your eyes with her screaming stunts. :-)"
2,Ehhh...whatever just read don't make it complicated!!,"This CD isn't really the best thing around. I mean it's okay but lets just say that it did flop. And it surely wasn't as good as all the rest of her CDs. Madonna is trying to sound British now, with the techno and everything, minus the rapping, I mean who goes from Italian, to Spanish, and now to British. Sometimes it doesn't effect her songs but there might be one or two songs that sound like songs from whatever country her husband or boyfriend came from. I can't really explain it, but anyway the CD is a dissapointment, bottom line."
1,Where is William Orbit when you need him?,"I'm a Madonna fan. Having William Orbit do Ray of Light was brilliant. This album is just bad. Elementary school lyrics, casio machine songs. You'd think it was 3rd grade kareoke. I've already given my CD away. She is the Re-Inventress, she just spun the re-inventing arrow and really needs to spin again."
5,Mind Blowing Album!!,"This album is probably her best yet... and as soon as memories are associated with it I think it will blow away Like A Prayer and Ray Of Light! Madonna's 9th full studio album American Life is a confesional of sorts... she invites you in and it feels like she is singing to you! Heavy influences of guitar are throughout and stings and of course electronic effects as well. This album blew me away! The highlights are many, starting with Hollywood going to Love Profusion and Nobody Knows Me and Nothing Fails (which by the way may be her best song ever!)to Intervention and X-static Process and Mother & Father and Die Another Day and Easy Ride... if you count I don't really like only 2 tracks and by the way I love the title track but it's [bad] compaired to this album!"
3,Why Do You Like Madonna?,"Madonna!! ""Whooee"", say many of my friends, ""what do you see in her?""....yes, indeed what do I see? Madonna burst onto the scene years ago with great music and voice. ""American Life"" is not up to her calibre. The computerized voices are of this time and ilk, but not of Madonna's. This is too commercial..her life and politics and philosophy deserve better. The first song ""American Life"" is the best-well voiced and lyrical music. The rest of the songs follow a familiar computerized syncopany. Madonna should return to her roots and forget the commerical aspects of her music. Add this CD to your collection, but not for its great music. prisrob"
1,Unfortunately Madonna Cannot Sing,"There are far, far better singers out there than madonna. I haven't listened to her music since the 80's. I lost interest and moved on to much more talented vocalists. She looks too weird now anyway. I don't know what kind of plastic surgeon she uses, but he should get his money back. Norah Jones and Annie Lennox were simply incredible at the Tsunami Benefit concert this past saturday...They are Great talents."
2,tiny toy,This is a very cute toy but not as big as I thought. I did not pay attenion to the size when ordering so this was my fault. Have not played with it yet but it is cute
3,oh yesssssssssss,"early 90 s tale of the vigilante punisher teaming up with super solider captin america to stop a rouge spy net work is great cra'ic with art by klaus jason(dark night returns) and good writing by DG chester make this a good read, a three part series in book shelf format, its well worth picking up! not sure wich part this is, but pick it up for some old school pun man action and cap shield slinging(yes seriously!)...."
1,ZR500 SUCKS!!,"This small and feature packed camera has one SMALL problem. It will NOT make itself available to the pc via the firewire cable!!Bought new firewire card, new cable, removed windows SP3 etc etc etc...NO success!!! Reviewed websites, researched forums etc...Buy a tested and working camera not this crap!!"
5,great little camera,"We bought this camera to film our new baby. It is perfect, easy to use and a great price. I researched a lot before I decided on this one and I am very glad I did. The picture quality is great."
4,"Love it, some tape noise","Like the widescreen capture, looks great on a widescreen tv. There is some tape noise as described in other posts but not as loud relative to the voices in video. Had a problem with firewire not recognizing it, but turns out it was my airnet card, replaced it with a belkin card and all is good now. Windows movie maker 2 won't handle the widescreen and does a terrible job of resizing it, so I am on the premiere elements trial and I love it."
3,R U Out of Your Ever-Lovin' Mind??!!!,"This kit works fine for simple cleaning of debris from a CD/DVD, but R U kidding me?!! I picked up one of these years ago at a certain store...hmmmmmm...let me give a hint...it is the lowest monetary denomination in our country....got it? It is OBSCENE to charge $30 for this simple item.So, if you can't find anything affordable like it and want to pay $10, then fine....but otherwise, have your head examined...with all due respect, of course :]"
5,Fantastic,"This is a tremendously well written book about the authors life in and around Tofino, BC, in the 90's. The amazing good times and bad times he faced are so well written, that you feel it as though you were there. If you ever wanted your life put into perspective get this one. I can't beleive he hasn't published anything since! Yet, hopefully."
1,Disappointed,"I have contacted Amazon and bountifulbookstore regarding this order and have no response. The order was placed on March 3, 2009. I have not received the book. If I do not receive the book or a response from either Amazon or the bookstore, I will request a refund from my credit card.Please contact me and let me know what is being done to get the book to me.Thanks, Don Lunsford"
3,An acceptable introduction,"Anyone who has read the Beats extensively will note gaps and errors in this collection. It conveys many popular myths, but any scholar of this era will be a bit disappointed."
4,Great for the Little Angel in Your Wedding,"This book uses a catchy poem to keep the reader/listener's attention. Great for ""just learning to read"" and young readers!An excellent gift for any little petal carrying angel!"
3,"Not as informative as ""The Ringbearer""","Our children are in an upcoming wedding, so we purchased the set of books to help them understand their rolls. The ring bearer was very informative however the flower girl was not as detailed as we had hoped. It only shows the story of the wedding, not the role the flower girl plays."
1,Hidden Hitch 70181 round tube receiver,"Installed on 2003 Ford Ranger. It says it doesn't fit, but it fit perfectly. It is a little tricky to install. The trick is to remove the spare tire before installing. I was able to to do it by myself."
5,Surviving the Hungry Years,"Very Interesting Story of Triumph! Jimmy Lane writes with honesty and holds ""no punches"" I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for an uplifting story!"
3,You can haggle price,"I was in the mall a week ago and was attacked by a salesperson for this product. Now, I'm a guy, so was not really impressed with the product, but thought they would make good gifts for ladies this year (mom, sister, etc.). I balked on the price and wound up getting 4 for $100. Yes, $25 each. Could have possibly gotten them lower."
5,Absolutely Fabulous!,"My mother bought this for me on a whim at the Northgate Mall in San Rafael after I complained of poor nails post acrylics. My favorite part of the nail kit is the Wild Kiwi body lotion. The body lotion is super hydrating, absorbs effortlessly into the skin, and smells WONDERFUL. I developed skin irritations to fragranced products over recent years and I am pleased to tell any lady with sensitive skin that I could use the lotion all over without ever getting itchy! The cuticle oil and 4-sided nail buffer are among the best nail care products out there - better than anything I had previously purchased at Sephora or Pure Beauty. After a couple of weeks of use, the cuticle oil reduced my ""hang nails"" and my new nail bed growth looked decidedly stronger. I definitely recommend giving this set a go if you like to have perfectly groomed natural nails."
1,Angry and ripped off,"I was also assaulted at a kiosk. The girl was sweet and very fast talking. I am disgusted with myself. I was taken hook, line and sinker (or rather, mud, lotion and buffer!!) I am well aware of the phrase, BUYER BEWARE. I don't know what came over me. I feel so violated. She ""neglected"" to tell me that the items are non-returnable..only exchangable...So I feel really stuck, after I read the fine print when I got home!! I do not want all this stuff and I do not know if I have any options. Anyone have any ideas. I have had buffers before and yes, they're cool!! But I could have gotten one at Walgreens for several dollars...not several hundred dollars, which I ended up spending!! I'm disgusted with myself and with their tactics!!"
2,shop the beauty supply instead,"Run, run away from the kiosk. Take a look at the other reviews. This is a decent product but not worth the price. The haggling at the kiosk, along with the slick selling will leave you with buyers remorse. Similar items can be purchased elsewhere....there does not seem to be anything special about these."
4,"Great product, if a little expensive","I was also stopped at the mall by a very sweet, young gentleman who impressed me very much with the buffer. My nails were already natural with clear polish (done myself), and he gave the same look with just the buffer. I totally wanted the product set, but was not willing to spend the $59 that he quoted me. I was about to walk away when he offered me two sets for the price of one and I fell for it. He asked me to promise that I wouldn't tell anyone, and that I should recommend it to my friends in return for his favor... of course, I now realize that it was a 'line'. I do not regret the purchase though, and cannot wait to do my nails! He did say that I could return and get the buffer strips replaced for free at anytime, so that does give added value."
2,Not worth it,"I bought this book because of all of the good reviews. I was NOT impressed. First of all, the writing is mediocre at best. The stories offer little in the way of meaningful character development and delve right into poorly worded sex scenes. The first three stories I read were about anal sex, watching your wife give another man oral sex and humiliating your husband by tying him up and ball-gagging him then penetrating him with a strap on. To be honest these stories turned me OFF and I'll be returning the book. Save your money this is not good."
3,"a decent conclusion, but not fulfilling","I received this in hardback as a gift and I'm glad I didn'tspend the money on it. Paperback, I would have bought.The characters seem less developed and the conclusions alittle too convenient for my tastes."
4,A Gem From The 80's.,"'Strange Animal' was the big hit from this album but I think the best tracks are 'Cosmetics' and 'City Of The Angels'. Gowan has very good voice range and the musicians are incredible on this recording. If you have it, dust it off and play it again. If you don't have it, you're missing a very good recording."
4,"""But You Can Call Me Lawrence...""","Larry Gowan's albums were indeed some of the best Canada produced in the '80s. Of course, that should be *Larry/Lawrence* Gowan, as opposed to Al Gowan.""Criminal Mind"" was a great song..."
4,Perfect Gift Indeed,The Perfect Gift was indeed that. Sometimes we need to give more of ourselves to our loved ones and this movie is a great depiction of what it could cost us. I loved it.
2,Meeh!!,"The storyline may have been about forgiveness, although I couldn't get to that part, because my stomach and intellect just couldn't hold down the horrible acting!!"
5,Thousands Cheer,"Why MGM have you not allowed this MOVIE to go onto DVD, don't listen to those that say the first hour is boring, this has to be one of the best musicals of the era if not of all time, I have just about worn out my second video tape of this movie, so please MGM put it on DVD as soon as possible.I am an ardent follower of Kathryn Grayson and coupled with Jose Iturbi is pure magic, I would give this 6 stars if possible, sadly they just don't make movies like this these days."
2,The Sound Of One Hand Clapping,"What a cynical exercise on the part of MGM!!! This alleged wartime morale booster is only worth marking time. This clumsy grafting of service romance and all-star review accomplishes nothing but a sense of ennui. For sure there are some high points i.e. Kathryn Grayson's angelic pipes and Gene Kelly's hoofing but otherwise I would just pass this one by. Do yourself a favor and watch ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" if you want to get into the war bond buying state of mind."
2,"Not much of the substance, a lot of fluff","Maybe a famous publisher made a favor to a famous academic architect (for years of cooperation) to publish the book with not much of substance, but graphically excellent on beautiful paper using very good technology and printing dyes?"
3,Precious Moments Scratch Mittens - 2 pair/pack,"This item was bought for a friend who lives in Australia so from what I can see of it, it looks okay & I can only hope she'll like it."
1,Not for old phone systems,"I purchased this to use on phones that we use in an area that has a lot of background noise. The phones and lines are old and we have a hard time hearing customers. However, this amplifies the noise and static on the phone also so they do not work for our situation."
3,Ameriphone in line telephone handset amplifier,"This item did not work with my phone system, however it was nice and the seller returned it with no problems. I had to get a hearing impaired phone instead."
5,It works wonderfully!,"I bought this amplifier for my husband. He has a hearing loss, but does not wear hearing aids. His job requires him to be on the phone for 12-hour shifts where he communicates with many people who are unable to speak clearly. To make matters worse, in the same room are another 10 or 12 people who are also on the phone just as he is. Noise blocking headsets have been a limited help in the past, but even the best and/or more expensive of these have fallen short of enabling him to clearly hear the most incoherent of callers. This little inexpensive item has been a wonder for him. Not only can he hear the caller, but he can even hear well enough to understand those people who have the most difficulty speaking. It easily plugs into the phone line. He attaches it when he arrives at work and removes it when he leaves. He is very happy with it. Should anything happen to this one, I would immediately purchase the same one again."
2,NOT THAT GREAT,"I bought two of these and installed them on different phones in different locations. They do magnify the sound but also give a ringing feedback when you pick up the phone which the caller also hears. If you turn down the volume.. guess what... no amplification!I took them off. Not worth the inconvenience, in my estimation."
2,Cannot Be Used,This amplifier cannot be connected to the phone of an elderly relative who is hearing impaired. The next time I visit her I will try to find a way to connect it.
3,company rating info,"This particular item was not compatabile with my CISCO IP 7940 phone, so I cannot speak to whether or not it is a good product. But I am writing this review to say the this company's customer service is superior. Excellent communication and follow up. So if you have a Cisco IP phone you may want to try something else. But if you have a phone this is compatable with it will probably work fine."
1,"Disappointed, but was promised a replacement","The amplifier and battery arrived quickly. The battery was new and strong; however, the amplifier did not work. The only time I could get any discernable audio to the telephone handset was when the amplifier volume was at its lowest setting. At all other settings the audio was completely cut-off. The shipper sent a postage-paid return label and I'm hoping to receive soon the replacement amplifier. The instructions are very comprehensive and detailed. One week after the shipper received the returned amplifier I am waiting for the replacement to arrive."
1,Problems,"I bought this for my father. I connected it according to the directions but it would not work, so I took it home and tried it out. Still would not work. Given some symptoms of other phones in the house I suspect it may have to do with the presence of wireless phones in the house (my dad had some also) because connecting this one to the line shut them down. It MAY work for you. I would try to get one to try out first."
3,Functional,"This little ten key is portable. The keys are a bit smaller than what you would find on a standard keyboard. The first time I used it, I was unable to get the cord to retract. The cord is very thin and I was afraid I would damage it. Lo and behold, a few months later it retracted on its own. Who knows.For the price, however, I'm ok with this purchase. It just stays in my computer bag until I need to use it occassionally."
3,camo stickers,stickers ok but with mods done to gun it didnt come close to covering all of it.it was easier to paint it
2,very bad choise,this item don't worth the cost... i have to do some costume cuts so it could fit my A-5 basic...
3,"Slow service, middling product","I ordered 3-7 day shipping and the item didn't come for 12 days. I had to go get another costume for my party. Once it got here it was ok, but I wish it had a narrower neckline."
2,This edition does not contain line numbers,"While this is an excellent play, do not buy this edition if you require line numbers for your class or production. It's the only edition I've seen so far that does not include them. However, I do like the large format of the page, if you want to annotate your own copy without line number references."
2,Damaged case,I recieved this product on time but it was damaged. The case of the CD was damaged. It not only was cracked but it was completely unuseable.When I opened the case it completely fell apart. The CD it self was not damaged. Luckly I had another case to put it in. I got it for a gift. The CD was wrapped in bubble wrap so it was obvious that the seller shipped it out with a broken case and did not care that he did so. I will not buy from him again.
4,great product,"great product, but the pediatrician ultimately ended up suggesting cetaphil for my infant's dry/reddened winter skin."
5,Excellent,Mark Lanegan shines once again with another brilliant solo album. I am not a big fan of cover tunes but Mark MAKES these tunes his own. The songs ooze hope and despair in equal amounts. If you are a Trees fan not familiar with Marks solo work I suggest you pick up this album. It goes well with a nice glass of scotch with the lights dim
2,not the right product,"the guides itself are good, they stick to the nails but the nails have to be washed and dried right before using them... if there are any oils on the nails, ofcourse they wont stick.the part that i'm not happy about is that i didnt get the product i have ordered... the picture itself shows V shaped and half moon but the product i actualy received has only straight and half moon shaped guides. the only reason i ordered was because of the V shaped ones. I tried calling many times this company and never got actual person to talk to.now the product number is the same as on the picture but the guides are not. I couldnt get any description on the product so i went by looking at the picture as it is supposed to be the same thing... i have used the same ones, same package before so that was another reason i went with the picture.i wouldnt have paid $10 for shipping and waited for something that i can get in any store here in town..."
2,Please fix the spacing,I don't get it: why can't Kindle editions maintain the original line structure and spacing? Running everything together and sort of randomly spacing here and there ruins the cadence and readability of the poem.
2,accident?,Perhaps there's something wrong with my kindle because all I see is a table of contents followed by a larger print of the table of contents...
2,Needs a better editor,"After reading The Golden Age, I quickly went out and bought the next to books of the trilogy. The Golden Age started a little slow and then by the end I was blown away. Then the last two, for me, spent more time treading water than getting anywhere.Before I was halfway through The Golden Transcendence, I found myself wishing that Wright had a strong editor. This trilogy really could have been one masterful book, or even two. But the material, as brilliant as it is, was just stretched too far.If you liked the first two, buy this just to end the story. But be warned, I found myself seriously just skimming pages. This is something that I almost never do."
4,pretty sturdy,"I use these for my radio stations' air studios (arms pointed in opposite directions on a desk when we have two hosts). They're tough enough to stand up to those fools messing with them. Very stable if mounted through a desktop. High quality hardware, and despite a few plastic pieces here and there - i think they'll hold up for the long haul.They also look GREAT!Still, 4 stars for using plastic where I wouldn't have."
1,This is Junk do not bother!!!!!!!!,Do not waste your money this thing is junk. THe only think this product did was upset my daughter!!!!!!
1,What a disappointment,"My son has had his color pixter for over a year now. Up until this point I have been pleased with all of the cartridges we have purchased. Naturally I assumed the digital camera would fall into the same category. I don't know who was more disappointed on Christmas morning. The quality is horrible. There is no way to take a ""clear"" picture. It is difficult for my 5 year old to get the target lined up and then remove one hand to push the screen without losing the target. The special effects would be great if you could see the picture. I think this product should be recalled. I will be making a return."
1,Junk,"Where can I get the Pixter camera shown in the Pixter demo? Or the one on the commercials? The pixter camera I bought certainly isn't the same one. The pictures where almost too dark to distinguish what they were. Finally, after turning on several strong lights we were able to get some grainy out-of- focus pictures. Very difficult for a child to take a decent picture. My daughter was so disappointed. The Pixter camera is what she wanted most for Christmas. DON'T BUY THIS TOY, IT IS JUNK!"
1,Don't waste your hard earned money,At first I was very excited to see that Pixter had come out with a digital camera. My husband is a photographer and since we love all the other color pixter titles we decided to buy this for our daughter so she can learn to take pictures for herself. There were none available at Christmas time so we would pick one up after the holidays. I'm Soooooo glad that we didn't. I tried one that my friend bought for her daughter and the picture quality was terrible. You can bearly see anything and unless you have very steady hand all you have is a blur. Did I already mention it is a terrible product. I'm so glad that I didn't plunk down my 30 dollars for this piece of junk and neither should you.
5,This cd just flat out smokes!,"Wow, what a disc King and crew have put together! This is some of the finest metal you'll ever hear out there.Period. As always, the production is first rate, as is the musicianship. And the composition and execution of the story is tight ,taut and interesting.As a long time KD and MF fan ,I can say that this stacks up with all his best work like Abigail.Yeah, I still miss Mikkey Dee, but Matt Thompson just kills it on this cd. [And Motorhead might have needed Mikkey more than King anyway...]What can I say about the guitar work, these guys are consummate musicians. The phrasing,lyricism and balls of the solos is top notch. Checkout Mike Wead's solo on the title track, I haven't heard a solo phrased that well since Adrian Smith's finest work with Iron Maiden. And they have the chops to make it sound easy.Very musical too, no shredding for shred's sake at all, the sign of mature craftsmen.Hat's off to Andy,King ,Hal Mike, and Matt. Keep doing it fellas, we love it!"
4,A Fascinating Read////,"I read this book from cover to cover last year while hospitalized with ""nothing better"" to read....and I HIGHLY recommend ""The Moneychangers"" as an exciting story written in a gripping, seat-of-your-pants style. Characters are so next-door-neighborly and you can really identify with almost all of them at some point in their progression.This book was written in the 1970's, yet its relevance especially in today's trying financial times will enlighten and educate anyone interested in the slightest about human psychology and the way money is so intertwined with our day-to-day lives. The ending couldn't have been more heroic, and I am surprised Hollywood hasn't run with it and created a truly RELEVANT blockbuster."
2,Rehashes of Songs He Already Recorded,"I love the album Kenny G, Faith, so I bought this one.It is most of the stuff on Faith with maybe a few new ones thrown in. I will be very careful in the future when buying recordings ofv all artists.In addition, there are many Christmas songs Kenny G hasn't recorded. If he wants to appeal to his fanbase he should have made an all new recording. Stuff like this just bugs people, they think they are being swindled by a different pic on the cover.I dont like it at all."
1,Boney James' Funky Christmas,"Before You Buy A Horrible Cd Like This One check out "" Boneys' Funky Christmas "" cd --- that is a great album !!"
5,Wonders First Race,Dont know why they called it a box set because it is just one book but other than that all was as expected.
3,WONDER'S FIRST RACE,I GOT THIS BOOK FOR MY FRIEND AND SHE REALLY LIKED IT. IT GOT TO MY HOUSE ON TIME AND WAS IN GOOD CONDITION.
5,Marina and Her Magic Flute,Marina Raye makes magic with any flute. 'Wings' features alto flute at its finest. The magical background sounds of nature enhance this musical wander. Beyond the Beyond - a wonderful musical experience.
5,Living Serendipitously,"I buy alot of books and loose interest in them quickly. This one really is a fast read! It grabs your attention. I find myself looking forward to having the time and making the time to read this.I am looking at things in life a little diffrently becouse of this book. I am recomending this to anyone that will listen to me about it. I can't get enough of this book. It is changing my life in a very positive way just by reading it, I'm becoming more awaire of the diffrences. Anyone who reads this book can't help but become more awaire of living life better, or having it more full. I bought this book for my step-daughter ,my son and my daughter-inlaw becouse I know they will benifit from reading this.This books is a life changing book! Thank you for writing this book!"
5,Disney classic cd,This music is so awesome I am happy that you hade another set out I went to disneyt waorld so I really wanted this music it came in on time and I was really happy that I found it here thanks
3,"Look for Rod Stewart's ""Once in a Blue Moon"" on Jan. 14, 2010 on the Rhino Records Website","Lead Vocalist included five new tracks that were recorded for an aborted album called ""Once in a Blue Moon."" Fortunately, Rhino is restoring this first great Rod Stewart covers album and releasing it in its entirety on their website with bonus tracks on Jan. 11, 2010. This will be a five-star, must-have for any Rod Stewart fan."
3,Stage for Presidents,"Air Force One doesn't break any new ground. There aren't any juicy revelations about our past or present presidents. Air Force One in this book provides a unique stage allowing us to briefly visit all of the ""flying presidents"" including their personality flaws and greatness. (or the lack thereof) It's an interesting book. You won't end up with it on your all time list of favorites but it's perfect for a summer day at the beach. Enjoyable reading."
3,Good for kids 7 and under for sure...,"Usually kid movies will keep me somewhat interested with some adult humor. All it had was a dog farting a few times and some bad Russian stereotypes and accents (kinda funny). You've likely seen the other buddy movies if you were considering this one, you'll expect the same caliber movie here."
3,"Far-fetched, but fun","Even though we all know this scenario would be totally impossible, it was fun for my grandkids to watch -- and clean!"
2,"Bad writing, bad acting","My 4 year old daughter loved the puppies, but the writing was so bad that I had to leave the room. Hearing a boy voice actor reading ""jive"" was poorly executed and not funny. Predictable, lame."
5,Space Buddies,I have three grandkids from 6-9 years old and they all enjoyed this movie. Good fun at a good price.
3,Average,"Too much explanation and not enough ""Tools"" for teaching. I didn't really learn anything new. I guess I'm too experienced for this one."
2,I don't get it.,"I wish I could say that I loved this book and it helped me tremendously, but I just don't get it. Maybe because I've been teaching for a while, so I either agree or disagree with all of it, but I didn't read anything new or helpful to me so it just seemed like wasting time. Perhaps I didn't give it enough chances. I picked it up multiple times and couldn't get my mind interested in this particular book; it's tedious and flat. I finally gave it away.Two stars because I officially did not read it from cover to cover, and so I felt it was unfair to give it only one. But it was only one-star helpful for me and not cheap, either."
3,Basic knowledge for a first year teacher,"Good information for first year teachers, but if you have taught for a while it is definitely just a review of everything that you already have experienced and know."
2,Not a loud ringer,This ringer is as loud as an ordinary phone. I was very disappointed. I can only hear it if I'm in the same room. I was hoping for a ring I could hear in the next room.
1,Not loud enough,Not very much louder than a standard telephone. Had to return and find a louder ringer.
3,Does the job,"This bra simply does the job. There are no other benefits to purchasing this item. It didn't lift or shape my breasts, but did hold them in place."
3,Disappointment,"The seller got this item to me quickly and in excellent condition.Too bad the series' 2nd edition didn't live up to my expectations. It was dull, dull, dull. A poor follow-up to a very exciting 1st series. I will not be ordering the 3rd season, if there is one."
5,FABULOUS!!!!,i love it i love it i love it! i have been watching them now for about 2-3 weeks now! every chance that i get i have been poppin' another one of the episodes in!! i have 2 or three left. i am savoring the moments before i put those last few in!!! because i want to make sure that the mood is right and plus i figure out where i am gonna get season three from!! i have season one and season two!!! i love it i don't want to play the last few episodes because season three is ?????
1,I will not use Amazone again!,"The product could not be played on my dvd. I think the problem was due to regional codes. When a customer from Norway orders a dvd, i thought it was your duty to chek if the dvd could be played on dvd players in that country. I will not use Amazone again.Petter Meyer"
2,Broadwalk 2...Same as Broadwalk 1,"Loved Broadwalk 1 so automatically ordered 2. My husband & I were disappointed. Expect for a few exceptions, it was exactly like 1, even ending the exact same way. Are we crazy? We keep thinking we must have received the wrong season."
4,Bingo isn't all they can do,"The second ""Gladdy Gold"" book that I read. Gladdy and her girls show again that you're never too old to do things other than play bingo. Such as solve several murders. Keep up the good work ladies!"
4,What fun!,"Our book discussion group read Rita Lakin's ""Getting Old is the Best Revenge"" at our last meeting. Rita came to visit and what fun it was. We loved the elder sleuths in the Florida retirement community. They seemed like old friends with all the quirks our own old friends exhibit. We all bought the next books in the series when we finished our discussion. Gotta see what Gladdy and the gang are up to now..."
3,good,"Very informative book. I have been on a military tear lately, reading all sorts of great books. What got it started was The Ultimate Basic Training Guidebook, which i highly recommend. I cant believe some of the information i found in this book. Its scary to think there are people out there with the soul purpose of killing americans"
1,Whitewash of the century,"An absolute horrifying whitewash designed to cover up the rogue elements within the US government who conspired to kill nearly 3000 people on American soil to launch a new empire using American military might.The towers were brought down with controlled demolition, the evidence for that is indisputable and non-negotiable.Sickening and boring and irrelevant, the 9/11 Commission Report deserves it's place in the dustbin of history."
3,"An important read, for rationalist and truther alike","I bought this book soon after it came out and I made it my dedicated reading material until I reached the back cover. Why? Because I felt it was important to understand as fully as I could one of the most significant events of my lifetime, hopefully there will not be many more to rival the attacks. That's a new word in our vocabulary, I noticed in conversations and news reports soon after 9/11 people would sometimes slip up and call it ""the hijacking"" or ""the bombing"" when it was not really those things. It was just ""the attacks"", there is not a word invented to fully comprehend this horrible event.There are many conspiracy theories around 9/11, I shall not refute them here nor will I spend much time creating dragons where there are none. I cannot explain everything about the attacks and neither will this book. This was a complicated event, with many causes, points of failure and its effects shall linger a long, long time."
1,Fiction. More lies per square inch than the Warren Commission Report,"I recommend reading this book, and follow along with Webster Tarpley's 911 Synthetic Terror Made in the USA. Also David Ray Griffins ""A New Pearl Harbor"". By the end of this exercise if you still believe the official myth put forth by this tome of lies, deceit and treason you should seek professional help.Seriously this is not only wrong on nearly every relevant fact (Purposely), but purposefully ignores all the facts that could distract from the official MYTH that they were appointed to propagate.Good job Keane! Great Whitewash! You'll go down in history as presiding over one of the biggest packs of lies ever created to cover up mass murder. What does this make you?"
1,Pure whitewash - should be called 911 Omission report,"Omits everything factual. Doesn't bother to mention, much less explain, what happened to the 47 box columns of steel from which the twin towers were constructed. Also no mention of building 7 falling on it's footprint at freefall speed, even though no airplane hit building 7.The purpose of this report is to reinforce the blatant official fantasy, for the purpose of justifying problem / reaction / solution, and getting you to cave in and accept greater government control over you.There was no effort made to check any facts. If you're seeking the truth about what happened on 9/11 you won't find it in this book. Instead you'll find lots of reasons to seek facts and you'll find the facts at [...]. You may also want to check out David Ray Griffin's books or Steven E. Jones.When a lie is big enough and you tell it often enought the people may believe it and this is the purpose of the 911 Omission report."
1,Did they count on us NOT actually reading this?,"There's not a whole lot to say on this report as there quite frankly is not a whole lot to the report. This is one of the worst pieces of ""investigative committee work"" that I have ever seen. They provide NO alternate viewpoints to the questions that so many are asking as to the holes in the official version. The complete collapse of building 7 is not even mentioned, and the report reads like a work of fiction, which in many cases one is compelled to believe that it is. This book and this report would NEVER hold up in a serious investigation in an impartial court of law (of course you would have to go outside of the United States to get that as any judge in this country will tow the government line.) If you can read this book with a straight face and not have numerous questions by REALLY paying attention to the text, then you're a better man than I."
3,Report Wrongly Accuses Several Administrations,"The 9/11 Commission Report is excellent reading material for people who suffer from insomnia. However, not all of the report is boring, especially the facts describing how the attack was planned and executed. The commision blames administrations, government agencies, and partisan groups for 9/11, but the blame should be placed on every adult in the United States. We have never been prepared for a terrorist attack. People felt that terrorism only happened in foreign countries, so why should we worry? The 9/11 Commission Report is essential because it reminds Americans of our stupidity and what we can do to be proactive about our Homeland Security."
1,"lies, cover-ups, half-truths, lies, lies, lies","How pitiful that anyone with a brain would believe this is ""unbiased"" when in fact, some of the people involved with this commission report now say it is untruthful. Let's have a real investigation, ok? There are too facts that dispute the official propaganda line, so please, read this if you must, but then put it down and read the other books that show how biased and untruthful this report truly is."
1,Does the Truth matter anymore?,"Incredible con job. This report answers NONE of the important questions about 9-11. When did the FAA notify NORAD? Why were the reports made by FAA personel... destroyed? Why did the buildings collapse? Building 7 !! Anybody who buys this book to display on their coffee table - hoping tp say ""look how much I care"" - is in fact saying ""look, who cares, we've moved on."""
1,Blatant Propaganda,"I have placed this book in the fiction section of my personal library. It reads as if the case is closed on the events of 9/11. It doesn't touch the tough questions, like requiring a scientific explaination for the physical destruction of the twin towers. It does not question the fact that ground zero was not treated as a crime scene. It does not give a reasonable explaination for the fact that no video of an airplane hitting the Pentagon has ever been producded for the public. It was proabably written in 2000, just insert names and dates."
3,The Holy Land (The Ancient World),"Pretty book and in perfect conditions BUT is important to know that there are other editions with different titles: ""Living in the Time of Jesus of Natzareth"", ""To History of the Jewish People in the Time of Jesus: From Herod the Great..."", etc.I bought these three books, had different titles BUT it was the same work of Peter Connolly."
2,Emil in the Soup Tureen,Poor paper quality of book is very disappointing - looks like a cheap copy.Story just not very appealing to most children. Maybe if you are nostalgic adult this would work - but for children - NOOOO
3,"Good text, needs supplemental information","The text was well written, but the lack of supplemental information (conversion tables, property tables, etc.) was very disturbing while solving problems. Most books of this type contain extensive tables, it is truly a hastle to have to find another book for these conversion factors and properties."
2,AVOID THIS BOOK IF AT ALL POSSIBLE!!!!,"Please do yourself a favor and avoid this book. This is the fourth edition and perhaps the worst introduction to fluid mechanics book ever printed. I am a PhD student and have had many courses in fluids. This book is riddled with errors and mistakes. The theory is correct but the derivations of certain equations and the solutions to many, many, many problems are wrong! I cannot believe these errors have survived to the 4th edition. Another reason to avoid this book is because the solutions provided with instructors make great leaps in solving problems. Many of the solutions state ""this problem requires a laborious derivation and is much too hard to solve"" or something to that effect! I also assist in teaching many intro fluids classes and this makes life miserable. Please use the 5th edition (or any other fluids book for that matter.)"
2,Boring,This CD started off strong... the first 20 seconds were promising. I think I yawned throughout the rest of it. Get Permutation... it's 100 times better.
5,Open your head and enjoy it!,"This album can make the sounds become images in your head. Its a complex, deep and rich work. You can listen to songs like ""easy muffin"", ""creatures"", ""the new york editor"" (I really LOVE this one) and ""the nasty"" over and over again and aways find some detail that you have never given atention. Open your head and enjoy it!"
4,"Great concept, but the newer model is much better","The concept is fantastic -- a wheel that doesn't require a mythical table of exactly the right height in front of your TV or foot pedals. However, this wheel is a little small, and the buttons are very hard convex plastic. Playing for any length of time will make your button fingers very sore.The newer version, the blue and black Gamester Pro Racer, is far superior. It's bigger and more accurate, and the buttons are concave and softer. I have both, and the new version is definitely the one to get."
1,Good looking corkscrew that does not work.,"I purchaed two of these corkscrews at a phenominal price.Too good to be true. The look like thge original seen in busy restaurants around town, where speed and accuracy are needed to open many bottles quickly.This model doesn't work or come with instructions.Six attempts left me with broken corks and bottles and no good results. I RETURNED THEM TO AMAZON FOR CREDIT."
4,A story that will bring tears more than once,"Once I found this book I couldn't put it down. It's one of the most heart-warming batch of stories one will ever read, and I teared up more than once while enjoying this book. I had never heard of the canteen, but have driven by North Platte while on vacation. Next time thru I am going to have to stop and chat with the senior generation and thank them. That is what this book is really about, saying thanks to all the people who helped out in a remarkable little way during the trying times of war. The stories do get a little repetitive by the end, but it is well worth reading."
3,disappointed after trial over,"After the preliminary trial time, almost all the research is locked out and you need to purchase individual research. Big disappointment"
4,Photo Phone,I purchased this phone for my mother who has dementia. She had some difficulty understanding how it worked at first but it did work well for her once she got the hang of it. I would have rated it with 5 stars but the area for the photos is small. I think it would be better with larger photo area and smaller key pad.
1,Hand Set Fails,"We purchased this telephone for its features. My mother has trouble seeing and hearing. The big, programmable buttons worked good. The boost button helped her hear those folks that called.We purchased the first telephone last Fall -- the hand set failed after approximately 5 months.Since she liked the telphone's features, we purchased her another one. That unit failed within 2 weeks!!People on the other end of the line either can't hear you at all, or just faintly. And this is with the boost on!!Very disappointed!!"
3,"A great idea, if not well-made","We purchased this phone for my great aunt a year and a half ago. It includes a one-year factory warranty. Unfortunately, now that it is 1.5 years old, it is no longer functional. While I am not impressed with a telephone with such a short lifespan, my great aunt is insistent that we buy her a new one because she dearly loved it. During that year and a half, it worked splendidly for her. She has troubles with her sight and hearing along with motor controls, and the phone aided her in all of those areas. I wish that the product were more durable and long-lasting, but it does do exactly what it asserts to do for the period of time in which it is warranted to do it."
4,a good phone,"I bought this phone for my Mom.. The amplification is sufficient. The amplification button has to be pushed every time a new call is answered . Overall I like the phone.... The ringer is loud and lights up...the buttons are large and there are plenty of options for pre programmed numbers... It does't feature a caller ID option that I know of , but again I thought it was a good phone for the price. Thanks"
4,VERY happy with my father's new phone!,"I ordered this phone for my father, who has Parkinson's Disease as well as hearing loss and some mild dementia. A phone that is simple to use is a MUST for him, and the picture/auto dial feature is a life saver! He can now call us without having to ask for help, which makes him feel good. The amplifier is great - yes, it has to be pressed every time you use the phone, but it's easy to find and with a little prompt from me, he presses it and hears VERY clearly.I would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone looking for an assistive phone for a loved one."
2,Poor construction quality,"This is the second phone that I have bought from you because it has the features I want but the construction quality is very poor.The keys used to stick on the first one I bought, and the ringer stopped ringing about a month after I bought it."
2,Dissasitfied!!,I have been a long time FAN of MAYSA ..but.. I'm trying to understand what has happen to her. Going back as far as INCOGNITO I have enjoyed her style and voice but this CD I have much regrets. The previous CD I did enjoy but this one has made me very unhappy knowing that it could have been better since she wants to do remakes. WHERE ARE THE LIVE MUSCIANS AT????
2,"Disapointed, Maysa's KARAOKE CD","I love maysa's voice and music which had been pleased my ear for years. But this is under average of her music.Her music on those Top 10 classic songs are only KARAOKE quality ( Record company wants Easy-money )Not good back music-a bad arragement with cheap sound.I don't think anybody would get impressed by her singing of ""FEEL THE FIRE"",After people listen Stephanie Mill's version & Teddy's or Peabo Bryson's version (original).I want Maysa would go back what she used to do"
4,"Wonderful, but a minor quality control problem","Five stars for Natalie Dessay, who has an incredible instrument, and a great selection of arias. But I've listened to 4 copies of this disc and each had a very short ""click"" at 2:22 on track 2 (the Gavotte from Manon). Must be a quality control problem. Maybe it was just a bad batch.Anyway, Dessay's voice is a force of nature; she must be one of the greatest coloraturas ever. I prefer her live version of Handel's ""Tornami"" from Alcina to Sutherland's. And she's incredible on Orphee Aux Enfers - not only a wonderful singer, but obviously a great actress and comedienne.So, if you've not heard her before, give this album a try - ignore the ""click"" and listen to a truly angelic voice.So 5 stars for Natalie Dessay and the selections, and a slap on the wrist for the record label and its quality control."
3,"Great voice, great music, lousy recording","If you're not bothered by recording problems and love Dessay, buy this CD. But the recording, by Musica Numeris in France, is sloppy at best. Perhaps the French engineer had a bit too much wine over lunch? Virgin should be ashamed and let's hope Sir Richard Branson takes more care with his airplanes than his Virgin group does with their CDs. The mostly clear recording is flawed by numerous ""glitches"" like the one mentioned by another reviewer at 2:21 on track 2. Some of it sounds like clipping distortion while others might be extraneous noises. Some of Dessay's crescendos are sadly distorted right at their climax. Quality problems like these are inexcusable on a full price classical CD. And it's a shame because it's a great collection of arias and Dessay has an amazing voice."
3,decent but not the best,"this story was a bit boring there was not much drama as in their true lifes ,others versions are better."
1,cheap manufacturing,Bought this adapter a while ago. Used it some and it blew up in smoke after a few uses. Luckily my Ipod did not go up in smoke along with it.
1,Did they do this on purpose?,"Did the producers set out intentionally to make a bad film? Could a movie this crappy be accidental? Is Crawford's character allowed to wear such short skirts in court? A poor movie all the way round, with only one highlight: Jeanette Goldstein as a kickboxing Russian assassin."
4,C'mon guys it isn't that bad,One more thing about 'Fair Game' I forgot that I just had to add. Salma Hayek's acting/character in the movie; completely hilarious! I was rolling on the floor laughing.
4,oxygene,ihave been a fan of gean michel for many years. i already have most of his music. just wanted to update oxygen to cd
2,These are just ok,"These are ok for a cheap pair of small scissors, but they kind of lose their edge and their tightness very soon. Then they can't really cut most things because the blades aren't moving tightly together."
2,Too Much About Ted,"What really bothered me about this book, is the author's tendency to spend four pages dissecting a poem, but does not offer a single reaction to Plath's death. Worse, not a word about her children, save where they lived. Assia Wevill's horrible suicide takes up a small paragraph, but one of Ted Hughes's girlfriends (whom no one knows) is granted two pages. It's all very odd.I have always wondered if anyone confronted Ted Hughes - how is it that he managed to drive two women to suicide? How could he abandon his children? These questions are not answered adequately and left me unsatisfied. Furthermore, this book contains several appalling spelling and grammar errors that could have easily been detected had it been edited properly."
3,Glove has PINK on the Back,"PLEASE NOTE: This Glove has PINK Leather on the back of it. It's probably a great glove in every way, except there was no mention of this in the item description that I could find. So when it arrived, I was disappointed as I had ordered it for my son, and he would not be happy with a pink glove as a gift. I returned it only because of the color. The picture shows just a hint of the pink color on it, which was hardly visable until I saw the whole glove and looked much closer. A picture of the back of the glove would have been great."
5,Fantastic book,"After visiting Peru this summer, I was compelled to learn more about the fascinating Inca culture. This book, which was written in the late 1500's by the son of a Spanish Conquistedor and Inca Princess is a priceless account of the rise and fall of the Inca empire. Written with the lyrical quality of reminiciant of Gabriel Garcia-Marquez, the book is a real page turner. The culture is full of prophecies that eventually, (and regrettably) came true, from the division of the empire by two brother kings to the eventual defeat and rape of the land by the Spanish. The Incas developed a magical culture, moving large stones and errecting beautiful cities without the use of horses or pullies, and passing stories of their past without the benefit of a written language. A must read for anyone interested in the native history of the Americas."
5,Awesome!,"At first I was worried this was going to be flimsy, and topple over. I was pleasantly surprised when they were delivered. They are quite sturdy, especially with water in the bowl. We have a Great Dane and it's the perfect size for her. They are ideal for all giant breeds. I also love that they're stainless steel...you don't have to worry about it cracking like a plastic bowl. These will last a lifetime."
3,Surprised,I ordered this for my granddaughter and after 2 nights and a total of 2 hrs of on time the bulb burned out and it can't be replaced....I contacted the company and they are sending out a new one.
2,A little disappointed.,"I bought this toy for a party with a casino theme. I had hoped to play it with several people, but it is too small. It would be better as a party favor.It should not be used by young children because of the many tiny pieces."
5,Geology of Big Sur,"I liked this book from the start-the Introduction asks: ""Where is Big Sur?"". Big Sur is an area in California but also a state of mind."" The book's only fault are the maps.Figures 1 and 2 of the California coastlineare incomplete. They show no local towns for an out of state visitor to reference as you drive the Coast highway #1. Luckily I have driven that area but I still needed my Rand McNally road Atlas to guess where the Towns of Cambria(near San Simeon) and Carmel would be on the maps. This is a fault of the authors since they describe Big Sur as ""the stretch of rugged coastline between Carmel and San Simeon"" in the text page 1, yet don't correlate their maps with their text."
3,worth buying but....,"I really dont understand all this enthusiasm about this book. Of course Capablanca is a great player, of course this book is a classic but also has some serious drawbacks. Capablanca was known for two things, first for his natural talent and second for his laziness. Both are apparent in this book. About the first i dont have anything more to say (see all the other reviews) but the second is a main problem of the book. A lot of chess material is inadequately unexplained or presentated very briefly. The usual excuse of Capablanca is that the student himself must go the analysis further...But i dont believe him, simply he was bored to make it himself (otherwise he could just write a chapter in the end of the book with supplementary analysis in order to be used as a benchmark in comparison with our analysis)Nevertheless a lot of the material is valuable for a beginner and an intermediate player and i think that it is worth buying inspite his cons."
2,"Interview Disc, most probably.","This is apparently a rerelease of an interview disc that's been available for a while now. It features short parts of interviews (neither of which are terribly good), narration (by some guy who pronounces a few things wrong), and a CD-size book, in which some factual errors are committed. Then again, I could be wrong, and it could be some new album. I hope I am, anyway..."
5,An exquisite view inside a mind tortured by obsessive love,"This amazing short novel (only about 100 pages)provides a view inside the mind of a man who is tortured by obsessive love for a woman who seems to be his mirror image; i.e., another tormented soul inhabiting the existential void. Or she may just be a superficial being who enjoys adding a famous painter to her list of conquests. The ""action"" takes place almost entirely in the mind of the narrator, Castel. We never really know who the few other characters are or what they are thinking. Sabato's ability to capture Castel's tortured thought processes is stunningly on point and makes for sometimes painful reading -- our 1990's psychology tells us Castel should have it all worked out; but the fact that he cannot escape his obsessions is the essence of his humanity. The bilingual edition makes it convenient to compare the translation with the original."
1,Very poor voice quality,constant static noise in the background like a scratched record. Many times when receiving a call the phone makes a screeching noise ... and reboots :(
3,Not as sturdy as other name brand products,"I had ordered a balancing ball from a name brand company. That ball came with an exercising dvd and a box. I enjoyed the exercises so much that I decided to order just the balls for my kids and husband, so I ordered from this vender because the prices were lower and I didn't need another dvd. Well, without the comparison, I probably would have thought that these two balls were fine. However, they surely pale in comparison. I hardly have to pump my first ball, and it would hold the firmness for a long time. But I have to keep pumping and re-pumping these frequently, using my own electric pump because the hand-pump that came with the items was too flimsy. It's good for camping when you don't have electricity, I gathered. You get that you pay for is certainly the case here. If you want to buy a durable, high-quality balancing ball that you can use for fitness purpose, don't buy from this company. Invest a few more bucks and get a good one."
3,Fairly decent product,I won't call it excellent or anything. I ordered pink color but they mailed me purple one and no body really responded to my mails. But the product is fine.
1,"Wrong size, wrong color","I recently ordered a 65cm pink balance ball from this listing. I received a 55cm purple ball instead. The package label said 65cm, but when I had inflated it, it measured at 56cm and was woefully too small for me to use.Fortunately Amazon has phenomenal customer service and promptly refunded my purchase, but I would not purchase through YogaAccessories again."
3,Not bad,"Maybe I'm just not putting the plug in the hole right, but this yoga ball is definitely leaking air. Also, don't bother using the hand pump if you can help it; you'll be at it all day. Otherwise, I love the color and the size is perfect."
4,Sweet,"Rubiyiyat is the very sweet, smooth icing of this delicious cake. Lots of different, wonderful flavors such as Jello Biafra, the Herbaliser, and Benard Purdie. A must have!"
2,Ambitious to a fault...,"...This album just didn't hold well together as a whole. Iknow that a lot of Ninja Tune artist are deconstructivists -- but thefun in taking things apart is to rearrange them in a *cohesive* way.This album just didn't flow at all, and is probably one of the mostdisappointing releases I own from Ninja Tune (one of my favoritelabels, btw). But I do admit that ""more beats+pieces"" was asick track. Otherwise, the rest is rather bland."
5,Great product,This was a gift for my daughter and she loves it.Service and quick shipping are super.
3,Canon ZR600,"I bought thus camcorder last month and find it harder to figure out than I expected. The image quality is good when filmingoutside but grainy when filming inside. My biggest disappointment is how difficult it has been for me to figure out how to transfer the video footage from the mini DV tape to DVDsand VHS tapes. If I had it to do over, I would pay the extra money for a camcorder that records directly to DVD. I wish Icould exchange this ZR600."
4,very pleasing,"i really enjoy this record, just let it go and give it some listens, i like how its not over done, feels real natural and well rounded. its a cornicopea of hip hop, turntablism, d and b and rhymin, not to mention that what what is an ill emcee"
4,Great for cruising around town!,"Great bike for the price. Not a bike for the hills. Seat is comfortable but if you are 5'10"" or taller consider purchasing a lay-back seat post for more knee room. Assembly time in less than 30 minutes. I ride it to work every day (3 miles each way) and love it. If you are looking for a cruiser just to ride around the neighborhood or around town this is a great bike."
2,"Wrong Display, Same book.","Unfortunately the text book was NOT the hardcover as shown in the display NOR was it the SAME COVERING as the one shown in the display either. I was sent the International Version. This may have not influenced the classwork or teachings, but definitely leads to distrust of the source."
1,Smallest (and worst) Guitar Amp,"I purchased this hoping it would have seperate controls for volume and distortion. Instead, DVForge somehow combined volume and distortion all in one cheap plastic dial, which results in very little control of distortion and volume. It also is EXTREMELY loud when you have any distortion.It feels and looks a lot cheaper in real life than it does in any picture. The plastic is very cheap, along with the buttons and controls (all two of them).I was hoping to save a few bucks by buying this small ""amp,"" but instead I discovered it's a waste of money. Since I have purchased the Jamplug I have bought a Line6 PODxt, and I use that with headphones. Although it's not portable, at least it actually sounds like a guitar and not some radio station fading out.This thing sounds absolutely horrible and is made very cheaply. Do not waste your money on it."
3,ipod friendly?,has anyone been able to rip this cd to their ipod? i noticed none of the reviews so far dosent really discuss this.
2,Good story bad author,Although this story is a really interesting one the writer did not do a good job of telling the story. I found the account to be a biased one full of bitterness and hate. I don't know what the author had against this person but it shows through.
2,Author tries but falls short,"Pat put a lot of time and effort in going to Kerrvile to attend this trial. Most of the trial portion in the book is accurate although Mosty not Mulder made the opening statement. I think she's probably guilty. I've read all the books on this. Pat's was the last one. It's a very interesting subject with a diverse group of people to write about it from different perspectives. I know Pat has gotten bad reviews for this book. She is a new author and you have to remember this was just her second book, so give her a chance and she may do just fine."
1,I am not a Routier family member and this book is bad,".... I think it is very inaccurate, that the author is biased, that the book is poorly edited, and that Darlie Routier is INNOCENT. I have never been to Texas, I am not related to any of the Routiers or the Kees or anyone else attached to the Routier family. I work in law enforcement. I personally think the Rowlett PD screwed up big time on this investigation, that the prosecutor needs a life and to actually review the actual evidence and realize that he sent an innocent person to death row."
1,Don't believe the hype,"This book is poorly written, full of indescrepancies, etc. Let's not use this review forum for a way to air our differences on Darlie's case. I too have read all 4 books, and find this one to be this book to be full of gossip and poor information. (I am not referring to typo's, I am referring to misinformation)Does have a practical use though, if per chance you are house breaking your puppy."
5,Enchanting Vintage Fairy Tale,I am a collector of fairy tales both old and new. This tale is little known and a gem if you can find a copy. The illustrations are delightful and a lost art. A must for any collector of vintage books.
1,Misrepresentation,"Didn't have the version of the song on it that it claimed to have. I love Janet, but I wouldn't have bought this if I had known...asked the seller before hand and I feel as if I was mislead."
5,Awesome,"This is the definitive book on hooligans. The writing is intelligent, and Bill Buford often breaks down the society he's studying with an amusing and deprecating wit. On the back of the book it says that _Among the Thugs_ is never condescending, which is the diametric opposite of the truth. The thing that makes this book amusing is its ability to portray the sheer insanity of hooliganism as the circus freak show that it is. Other writers treat this subject with a been-there-done-that sort of nonchalance. Bill Buford, on the other hand, sees the phenomenon through the lens of a mild mannered American who is justifiably shocked and horrified by what he is witnessing. For the American reader, this is the ideal standpoint because it is important to emphasize just how utterly ridiculous, alien, and unfathomable hooligan behaviour is to a civiized American. I highly recommend this book as a fast, entertaining, action- packed, and often hilarious read."
5,this album is different but very good.,"This is fun to listen to. It is not a typical Mum album, but it is good. I recommend buying this if you are a fan."
1,"Rambling, incoherent -- do not buy","I own many hundreds of books and have never written a review before. If I could give this book a negative score, I would. It's not that this book contains well-thought-out discussions of controversial issues, it's that it's poorly written and nonsensical. Scott Ryan is a theist, specifically, a pantheist whose primary loyalties are to Judaism (this is nearly a direct quote from Mr. Ryan, see page 390).If this book represents his genuine attempt to debate the relative merits of Objectivism vs. some alternative, it's a colossal failure. It's full of equivocations and apparent misreadings of both those philosophers he likes and dislikes. It alternates between large blocks of quoted materials and smaller out-of-context quotes mingled with irrelevant minutiae. It's terrible.This book is as incoherent as Scott Ryan's own apparent beliefs. If you want to learn about Objectivism or pantheism, or Judaism, or anything else -- don't buy this book."
5,A Complex and Interesting Translation,"I thought this was one of the best fiction books I have read (actually I listened to it). I get the feeling that the reviewers who didn't like it, just didn't like the anti-US-ishness of the author's point of view and then took it out on the book. I write to add that the translation of the book is excellant!!! The descriptions are interesting and are not lost in the translation. I do think this book is probably better listened to, rather than read -- and the reader is one of the best."
3,3 1/2 star rating,"This is the first of Daniel Defoe's novel I've ever read and I found it pleasing enough in both story and characters. The plot was concise and quite surprising at times, making it entertaining enough to get through it with general ease.One thing that is different is the age of the novel, seeing as it is written in the old English fashion, with words that would be considered grossly misspelled these days, and with many words capitalized that are not done so today, unless at the beginning of a sentence. Also, it can be confusing at times, especially when the characters talked, since there are no quotations used. You really have to pay attention when reading it at instances like this, but you can used to it pretty quickly if you choose too. A good classic, but one I will probably never read again."
3,"Much information, poor presentation.","Dennett may have experience and insight into complex subject matter, but this book meanders relentlessly across to many divergent paths"
3,"Will you, too, be fooled?","I am cautious to imply whether one should or should not read this book. Let me be generous and begin on the positive side.This is a book about interesting and important issues.It is designed to be interesting and hold the attention of a wide variety of readers.On the negative side:-Dennett is probably wrong.-Even if he is right, it can't be convincingly proven.-The type of people who are convinced by this book are a) not highly critical thinkers or b) already believe what Dennett has to say, in principle, on faith. Science involves plenty of faith, but shh!! No one wants you to know that. I can't explain it all now, I need to be saving my energies for responding effectively such challenges in a more rigorous and high-stakes format."
4,"Average, saved by the Simpsons.","If it wasn't for the Simpsons voices and Simpsons cars and Simpsons everything, this game wouldn't be worth anything. It really is Crazy-Taxi lite. It's a lot easier than Crazy Taxi, and much goofier.The loading times hurt the game and the voice acting is a little odd. I don't think the designers did it well enough. Sometimes it seems like what they say is totally random.The modes are okay. There is a lot to do in the game, but it is tedious. YOu have to do the same thing over and over to get money which allows you to get more cars and more areas to travel in. After a while it gets tiring, especially with the loading time.Rent this one, or buy it cheap."
5,Meet the Simpsons,"Everybody loves the simpsons, myself included! This is going to be one of those games that you can play forever and never get sick of. A classic, I hope... Sorry to say, the graphics will be much better on Xbox. Sorry playstaion lovers. Get an Xbox!!!"
5,fun!,My 7 year old gets the biggest kick out of this game. It is a tad bit more violent than I normally allow him to play but no more violent than the actual cartoon. It was a big favorite at our house.
2,Maybe I'm being too harsh....,"...by giving this game two stars. I would have given it three, but it just isn't that good. This game is fun for about 30 minutes but then it's just boring. You pick up the same people and take them to the same locations. The missions are boring and the only thing good about this is the two-player Head To Head option. Now that is some good fun. The graphics are pretty good for the PS2 also but those are the only little things this game has going for it. Sorry, Simpsons fans, but this is going to be a disappointment unless you are a die-hard Crazy Taxi fan."
2,There's no reason to get this game.,"This game is pretty boring. It's just like Crazy Taxi, just with the Simpsons as the cast. The game is just the same thing over and over again, you pick up passengers and drop them of at the designated area in the time limit you are given, so the game is to repeticious. I rarely play it anymore. The only thing I really liked were some of the silly things that the characters said, other than that, there's no reason to get this game."
1,What a load of crap,This game is just like Crazy Taxi except done in the most horrific way possible...1 out of 5 stars! This game had like no good gameplay except pick up people and drop em off and a very short story mode...Which is also crap...Nothing really to do except listening to annoying bad music which isn't even good and really really bad gameplay....Hit and Run is waaaaaaaaaaaaay better then this malarchy....1 out 5 HORRIBLE GAME!Lates..
4,It's fun,"It was fun but it loads after every action you put in. It has to load new user, load new car and place, load again to play, load to show your score,and then you start all over again. The loading isn't short either. It's loooooonnnnnnnggggg. If it weren't for that it would have gotten a 5."
2,Stick with watching the show,"Everyone loves the Simpsons right? So how could a game staring Americas favorite cartoon family go wrong? Well for starters rather than coming up with an original concept they just offer us a ""Crazy Taxi"" clone, and not even a good one at that. Game play is simplistic and level goals seem pointless. The only good part about the game is hearing you favorite charicters interact with eachother. I say stick with watching the show and leave the game alone."
3,Mixed Bag.,"Ive always injoyed the Simpons, but this game gets old fast. because you don't have any change of back ground and after so long of running over the same things( Rocks, Stop Sighens, other cars, Lawns, Childern) over and over agian the game gets lame, and the missions are hard to beat. However the the graphices on ""Road Rage"" is very good.Rent this first before you buy."
5,All right lets go smash things,"Sweet and cool are the two words to describe this game. It is better than Crazy Taxi, but only if u like The Simpsons."
2,What's with the load time?,"This game is a fun concept, and the Simpsons references and sounds are great, but it takes FOREVER to load! And then you finish a level, and it takes FOREVER again. And then you start another level, another ETERNITY of a delay. It felt like I was back on a Commodore 64. Maybe worth a rental, but don't buy!"
3,Fun game but boring in the end,"This is a good game the first 10 minutes, after a while its just the same and so repetetive...the goal is to gain enough money to save the town or something, but the way to gain money is by picking up people and driving them around. You have to play for months doing the same thing over and over to win. It is an okay game but i do not recommend spending more than 10 dollars on it if ur going 2 buy it : )"
5,South Vietnam 2ft x 3ft flag,"I am very pleased with this product the quality is very good in that the colors are very radiant, it will surely look good in my room and i would like to point out it arrived rather fast much sooner than i had expected, i would recommend the seller to others."
4,Pawleys Island,I am loving the lowcountry tales. Love all the southern charm. Good story lines. Good character development.I feel like I am there the way she describes the Island.
2,Low Country Series,"I'm just finishing up Dorothea Benton Frank's Pawley's Island. I have read all the other books in her Low Country series as well, and I have enjoyed them. This is not one of her better efforts. The basic theme for each is that of a woman in trouble reclaiming her life. Lifetime channel fare, really, but they're fast, easy reads. The descriptions of life in South Carolina sound very appealing, however, the one off-putting thing is that the black characters in her book always seem to be servants, often over-educated and highly intelligent, but servants nonetheless."
3,Not up to her usual standards,"I've read all Dorothea Benton Frank's books about the lowcountry of South Carolina, and since I am a South Carolina girl, I have enjoyed each one of them. However, Pawleys Island just wasn't up to her usual standards. I felt characters were not fully developed and I didn't get a good sense of the uniqueness of Pawleys Island from this book. Some of the author's ""soap box"" moments made me somewhat irritated with her use of her faithful audience to air personal opinions. If you enjoyed her previous books, you will enjoy this one -- but you'll be left a bit disappointed."
1,Horrible Narration for Audio Version,"Why all writers think that they can do narration is beyond me. What a waste of money for the audio version of this book. I couldn't even get through the first chapter. The author smacks her lips, does deep breaths, and can't even get the inflection right. Was the author just trying to save money by not hiring a narrator? Guess I will try the print version.What a shame!"
1,Pawleys Island,"I actually got this audio from the library....Thank goodness I didn't purchase it! The price on the holder is $102.25. I came to Amazon the check the real price and decided to write a review to help someone save some money. It as is so poorly read by the author that I can't believe it is even on the market. She stops mid sentence, pronounces words wrong. I couldn't get through the first disc and had it set to go back to the library. However, I ended up needing something to listen to and tried again. I have managed to make it to disc 4 and find the story really very unrealistic and I have not been able to get used to the extremely poor reading. I wanted to like it as I have children in that area and spend a fair amount of time in the Charleston area and enjoy reading low country books. I advise everyone to get Pat Conroys, or Sue Monk Kidd and skip this one."
3,Please update!,"Great book, full of information, but really needs to be updated. It was published in 1997 and things have changed quite a bit since then..."
4,It works,My hubs has a classic truck that he uses as a commute vehicle and this has helped him keep his coffee mug upright.
5,MUST READ!,"Love, Love, Love these stories. I read them years ago when they were first released and just read them again on my Kindle. You will not be disappointed!"
5,Bought for a gift.,"I didn't listen to these myself, I bought them for a gift for someone. But, the response I got back was good. Cd's worked fine and the person was happy with the gift."
5,Super Cool!,"Hi im Alfred, if you are a sports car fan you need this car. I know it costs alot but it's worth it. im 17 and I love it. my dad is a cop so he has one of those radars and we check it it whent up to 20 mph!"
1,Never Received the book,"Very dissatisfied. It's been about 2 months since I ordered the book, and I never got it. If you're going to sell something make sure it gets to whoever bought it it!!!! I'm incredibly angry about this."
5,groundbreaking,"On its way to the bestsellers list. This is the most insightful, intelligent, and practical analysis of anger I have ever come across. John Rifkin is onto something. His Stop, Drop, and Roll technique will change your life. A must-read if you suffer from anxiety or depression. Beautifully written, well paced, logically organized, helpful metaphors, an easy read. Perhaps the only advice on anger to date that is of any use to anyone who seeks real and lasting change in their relationships."
2,"Incredible guitarist, so-so singer and writer","I've always felt that Lita Ford is one of the best guitarists I've ever heard. Unfortunately, she directed her considerable talents into making fairly generic pop metal records, and that, along with the leather-vixen bleached-blond look, destroyed any credibility she had. Admittedly, ""Kiss Me Deadly"" is a fun song, but everything else on this is roll-your-eyes boring, although Lita can carry a tune. If Ozzy Osbourne had hired her to play on his records rather than singing on hers, the name of Lita Ford would be mentioned along with--dare I say--Eddie Van Halen? If you can get past the pedestrian lyrics of her songs and listen to her amazing guitar, this isn't a bad buy, but it's tough."
3,fine jazz-rock/fusion trio-album,Mike Pachelli this time shows talents on his guitar that seem to be inspired by the 80's chordal work of Allan Holdsworth and Bill Connors; strong riffs and theme's introduce improvised solo's that will bring the lovers of jazz-rock as well as shredding-fusion in a good mood.
3,Worked great for about 10 months,"I bought this device to replace my original Vonage router and was pleased to eliminate clutter from my desk by having a single router and phone device instead of a dedicated device for each. It worked great for about 10 months and then just died unexpectedly. I have not gone back to linksys to find out if they will replace it under warranty or not, but that's just too short a time to have a failure. Lesson learned: all in one isn't always best. When the router went, I lost my phone and all my PC's lost internet connectivity."
1,Horrible,"Ok, the Graphics are alright, but everything else makes for a horrible WWF (no im sorry, WWE!!!) Game. Just like the WWF/E, this series is going down the drain."
2,Story mode blows,"When I got this and heard of the indepth story mode in which you make decisions I thought it would be great. However, it's really short and just doesn't have the depth it talks about. If you're looking for a game to just have big matches with your friends, check it out. But if you wanna have real story mode, wait for a sequel and hopefully they will have fixed it by then."
3,DONT MAKE SENCE,ALL OVER THE GAME IS GOOD EXCEPT WITH STORY MODE AND CREATE A PERSON. HOW CAN HAVE 2 PLAYER STORY MODE IN SMACKDOWN 2 AND NOT HAVE 2 PLAYER STORY MODE IN SMACKDOWN 3 THAT DONT MAKE ANY SENCE.AND THE CREATE CHARACTER MODE HAS STUFF U DONT EVEN NEED. LIKE EYEBROWS WHO NEEDS TO FIX EYEBROWS ON A WRESTLER. COMEON!
3,"Average, as it's not released, and better safe than sorry!","I'm going to give this an average rating because I am somewhat wary of it. I have every THQ game on the N64 and I love them with all of my heart. I treasure them. I bought the original Smackdown with a trusting heart and a blind eye. It had made a great deal of noise and the fanfare of its creation led me to purchase it without prior knowledge. The game made me nauseous... likterally. The 64 and the Playstation are two different consoles; I discovered this the hard way. PS2 is new, untested, and very promising. Because of my love for the other games, I plan on buying this one. Because I was burned on the original Smackdown, I think I'll spend the bucks to rent it first. Better safe than sorry."
1,THE WORST OF THE SERIES,"WELL, THIS GAME AIN'T NOTHIN BUT A PS2 VERSION OF SMACKDOWN 2. AND THIS GAME AIN'T EVEN BETTER THAN THAT! THERE'S A LOT OF NEWER WWE WRESTLERS TO CHOOSE FROM, BUT THE GAME IS VERY UNINTERESTING, HAS BAD COMMENTARY DURING MATCHES, AND THE CONTROLS ARE STILL BAD. THIS IS THE WORST OF THE SMACKDOWN SERIES AND THIS WAS THE WWE'S PS2 DEBUT. THE GRAPHICS ARE ALSO PRETTY BAD TOO."
4,Is it just me?,"I don't know, I'm a big wrestling and video game fan. I loved SmackDown 2, but I think the 3rd one (Just Bring It) is too easy. It's fun to play with a bunch of friends, if everybody is at the same level, but for me, when I play the computer for fun, the matches are'nt really interesting, I mean, like, a minute and a half MAX per match, so I guess there's a bit of a lack of challenge. But graphic wise, the characters charisma and all, it's pretty damn good!"
4,Hi!!!,"Hi, i really enjoyed this game. the sound could use a little bit of an upgrade though. The graficts are awsome. the rock looks the best!!!!!!!"
5,AWESOME,"this game is very cool. it has a lot of unlockable moves that look very cool. the graphics on this game are unbelievable! this game has the most realistic looking Undertaker from any wrestling game. there is about 40 wrestlers. the unlockable wrestlers are Spike Dudley, Rhyno, Fred Durst, Stephanie, Shane, Mick Foley, Jerry Lynn, and Tajiri. The wrestlers are all very detailed. The masks look exactly like real life (Kane's). however, this game will no doubt be beaten by SD4!"
1,YAWN!!!!,"One of the first 2 games I bought with my new PS2.The entrances are very good, you have a bunch, of wrestlers available, and tons of different match types. But the real reason you want to buy this is for the game play right?Game play just stinks! Story mode is a complete bore. The 'commentary' is annoying: ""This is a great match"", ""HHH's finisher is a great move"". You want to turn it off. Save yourself $..., rent it, and you will make your own conclusion.I have played this game for about a week, and maybe I can't figure it out, but it seems as if you can't tag in your partner during a tag match (???)"
4,The Smackdown had been laid,"I traded my friend a wrestling game i didnt like for this, and i love it. Its fast,l fun, and has catchy background music. If u play a hardcore match, u can go anywhere, AN I MEAN ANYWHERE! A kool thing about this one is if u do ur finisher and it works, u can pin them immediately and win. Some downsides are the graphics (well remember this is 2001), the memory card space, and the way the CAW faces look retarded. Overall its fun, but i wouldnt recommend it to people who care to much for graphics."
4,Like a real dog,"This is a great product for a little kid who really wants a dog, but is too young to care for one. My niece who is five years old just loves her new ""dog"" and it never has to be walked!"
5,lifelike and well made.,My granddaughter is thrilled with this wonderful black lab toy. It looks so much like a real lab. Prompt delivery and good service.
4,funkjazzfusionacid all the way live,herbie hancock fans who wanna hear him and headhunters live in concert from the mid 70's please cop this features acid guitarist dwayne blackbyrd mcknight right before he joinede funkadelic.
2,Anchor point,"I like the the anchor, but the coating on the outside is coming off because I put some heavy work on it, but it shouldn't come off. I think these anchors are wonderful, just wish they were more endurable."
3,My Thoughts,"Maas does a good job of keeping the reader interested and moving the story along, however, I feel that because of this some of the details of the CIA's involvement in the investigation are glossed over. My only other complaint is that I felt Maas didn't spend enough time explaining the importance of the U.S. sources that Ames gave to the Soviets and who they were. While Maas does a great job in portraying Ames, putting a spotlight on his character for the reader, humanizing the agents whose deaths Ames is responsible for, would add to the reader's understanding of his depravity and villainy masked by his self-centered worldview. Despite these complaints, Maas's, Killer Spy, is a well written, detailed account of a fascinating espionage investigation not to mention a fun read."
4,Keystone cops on assignment,"This book is relatively short but it provides enough information on the subject. I also liked its matter of fact presentation of the events.But the truly amazing part is the ""Keystone Cops"" aspect of the whole affair. CIA and FBI joint task force identified Ames after the first real check of the financial status of possible sources, but it took 10 years of humiliating failures for this pretty routine investigation to get started.And after that initial success the team of top flight FBI agents experienced one snafu after another trying to catch Ames and his Russian handlers red-handed and finally gave it up."
1,The Junior does NOT GRUNT and is too big for many small dogs to squeak,"I have a Hedgehog from petsmart, my dog races around with it and squeaks it, she has a small mouth. Now, I ordered a grunting hedgehog for more money to find out it doesn't GRUNT, i have to order the larger size. And the Junior size is tad bit too large and the squeaker is buried, so it's impossible for my dog to squeak it, and she is a good little squeaker ;-) I would steer clear of the junior, BUT if you want the new long round ones, those grunt and a small dog can get it's mouth around it to make it grunt... go THAT WAY ;-) Hope that helps!"
1,Just Terrible...,"I was really excited about reading this book, you just have to love the premise. Bad Guys, Motorcycles, Biker Girls, etc. Too bad that Mr. Barger takes a topic so interesting and leaves you with so little. For example, he was at Altamont on the day of the Rolling Stones concert. He tells the story, and adds no isight as to why it happened. The book also tells story after story without any transition or any depth at all. You keep waiting for him to bring all of it together and it never happens. It is like you have an annoying relative over and they keep talking and talking and never get to the point. Please save your money. There are so many better books."
5,Übermensch,I just finished the book. It captured my attention from the start and I didn't want to put the book down and so I read straight through it in a short amount of time. It was an interesting look inside the world of the Hell's Angels from the perspective of Mr. Barger. There are numerous stories of the adventures of the motorcycle club and descriptions and photos of a lot the members. It gives you the feel of what it means to belong to a tight-knit brotherhood. It's a club that has the guts to stand up to the world and take their freedom in full measure.
3,Not too bad,"This book is not a bad one. It flows rather well and it in depth enough to get the readers attention and keep it. But it should more properly be called The Sonny Barger story. It is less about the MC and more about his personal trials while creating this awesome motorcycle club. The book, as previously stated, is very well written and his details about events almost 50 years ago is outstanding!!Just go into it with the mind set that the book is more about him than the club."
5,Completely Fascinating,"I became interested in the world of the hardcore American MCs when I started to watch Sons of Anarchy religiously. After that I wanted to know more, had to. I knew Sonny as the character of Lenny ""the Pimp"" Janowitz and when I discovered he was a real life Hell's Angel I was determined to find out more about him. The second I started to read this book it was impossible to put down. It gave insight on some of the major scandals revolving around the club and showed who's side was right to be on. Now I hate the prima donna Rolling Stones, detest Hunter S. Thompson and idolize Sonny Barger. He tells you his story without sugarcoating anything which makes it even better to read. If you have even the slightest interest in the Hell's Angels then this book is a must read."
1,Costume,This item is very thin and is not made well. The hat torn instantly once my son put it on. I would not purchase this item again.
2,Poor online product description...,"It wasn't clear from the online product description that you have to buy another item to use with this book. I bought the book thinking that it should be a complete product at the price. However, my grandson can't use the product because you have to buy a little computer to use along with the book."
5,Jazzybeautifulfunkymusic,"Awesome album! Here it is, short and sweet...The Rainbow Children Starts out smooth and jazzy, then you find yourself in some beautiful music and you end with some of that funky guitar stuff that we love from Prince. I'll be honest, this is a concept album and it takes a few listenings. By the 2nd or 3rd time, you realize how perfect and layered the songs are. I don't no if there are any singles from the TRC but some of my favorites are 1+1+1is3, She Loves me 4 me, Last december, The Everlasting Now, Family Name...Oh what the hell, it should be treated as a whole and the whole is Great!"
5,Brilliant!,"... ""The Rainbow Children"" is the most challenging, sprawling and consistently brilliant LP Prince has released in ages and I'm better for it's mere existence! I won't even insult this man's sheer genius by narrowing this down to a handful of good tracks, I'll just say that the outright jazz explored here is a very refreshing turn of events and represents a true evolution of The Prince sound. As far as the spiritual bent of the lyrics, this is truly a man reborn and not everyone is going to get it. Spiritual reawakening in popular music is a tricky thing, but I'm glad I get to witness this transformation."
4,If you are a prince fan...,get this album. It's another genre covered by his musical genius. Expect to hear a contemporary jazz album with splashes of rock and some snips of opera. It's cool. It's different. Expect that and you won't be disappointed.
1,Don't Do it!,"This album is bad. It's not even bad in a fun campy way. If you thought ""Animal Kingdom"" from Prince's ""The Truth"" album was preachy and condecending you haven't heard the start of it! The music is still interesting but the lyrics are so offensive in a over-the-top Jerry-Falwell kind of way that I reccomend that you buy everything up to ""Crystal Ball"" and forget that Prince ever did anything after it. I paid [money amount] for this album and it was too much at that.Addendum; I still hate this album and had declared Prince ""dead to me"" because of it. However; starting back up with 3121, Prince may have gone all Jehovah's Witness but he has remembered how to Rock."
2,TOO PREACHY!!!! HE NEEDS TO CHILL WITH THE SERMONS!,"I HAVE BEEN A PRINCE FAN SINCE I'VE BEEN A LIL KID AND HAVE LOVED HIS MUSIC, HIS ARTISTIC GENUIS BUT, HE GOES OVERBOARD WITH ALL THE SERMON'S LIKE HE IS SOME TYPE OF NEW AGE PHILOSOPHER! EVERY SINCE LARRY GRAM CONVERTED HIM TO JEHOVAH WITNESSISM HE HAS BEEN PREACHING AND TELLING PEOPLE THAT WHAT THEY THINK OF THE BIBLE IS WRONG AND HIS NEW FOUND KNOWLEDGE IS RIGHT, CHECK THE LYRIC FOR THE EVERLASTING NOW ""ACURATE KNOWLEGDE OF CHRIST AND THE FATHER WILL BRING THE EVERLASTING NOW....NOW WHATS HIS VERSION OF ACURATE KNOWLEGE,HIS KNOWLEDGE ACCORDING TO JEHOVAH WITNESSISM! I JUST WISH HE WOULD PLAY AND STOP THE SERMONS! LIVE HE CAN'T BE TOUCHED, BUT ONCE HE GETS IN THE STUDIO HE SCREWS IT UP!...OK WELL, AFTER MY RANT WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT THIS CD, I'LL PUT IT LIKE THIS, IF YOU LIKE YOUR FUNK WITH A HEAVY DOSE OF PREACHY SERMONS THIS IS YOUR CD!"
3,What the duck? Get it for the music,"Some great music here, but the lyrics, ugh, if this is Prince having finally found a religion he can live with, let's go back to Prince the seeker a la 'Lovesexy'. Some of it's sexy and clever and funny (like when he pokes fun at himself in his 'Camille' voice with 'I wish he'd play like he used to, old scraggly head') but the incessant preaching, the nutty Jehovah's Witness / Afrocentrist / male-supremicist / conspiracy mythology passed off as history, and the vile, smirking references to 'Mr. Rosenbloom' and 'Mr. Perlman' and the Holocaust, are repellant. It's a measure of how far off the radar Prince had fallen that it didn't cause any controversy (...) I wonder if anyone will challenge him to explain any of it now that he's making a long-deserved comeback?And yes, the recording itself is distorted as hell -- try listening on headphones, it's a fuzzfest. (...)"
4,"Stop the preaching, and give me the music!","I love the music on this release. Great organic sounding production, superiour songwriting. He's left off a lot of the fluff that's been on his recent releases, but the music gets muddled with all of the preaching throughout the CD. Still one of his best since Lovesexy."
5,Back to the Prince we know and Love!,"This CD comes with everyting you love about prince and his creative musical talent. It goes from mellow to dance to spritual a little something for everyone. This reminds me of the good old days when you bought a album and enjoyed it from front to back. Some particular favorites include Muse 2 the Pharaoh, 1+1+1=3, She loves me for me and Family Name. It's all good for faithful Prince fans I guarantee you won't be disapointed you'll love it!"
2,Not the Prince I Grew Up to Love,"In the last decade, Prince has all but abandoned his darker, raunchier side. Every other album he released in the 1980s was a verified classic, but in the last 10 years, his output is hit-and-mostly-miss. ""The Rainbow Children"" is a tough album to sit through, and it will require patience from even the most rabid of Prince devotees. Though the disc has some moments (nice artwork, too), it has two or three good songs buried underneath heaps of filler."
3,"Illegal, Immoral and Unprofessional/Moving Targets","Flo and Eddie, great memories. Seeing them in Hollywood was fantastic. They put on a hell of a show. Very entertaining. This recording, which I think was one that I was at, is just a sample of the actual show. Listening to the disc was very disapointing. The editing on it is very unprofessional. Songs fading out or just cutting off, where it should have been faded out.Also seems like they left off a lot of material. Oh well, what can you expect nowadays."
4,Great fun,"We own about 10 rooms worth of Ryans Room furniture and I can't say enough good things about it. My kids (3 year old boy and 9 year old girl) both enjoy it and play together for hours. The quality is generally very good. After several months of fairly rough play, my 3 year old son managed to break off the steering wheel and dash board but it should be a very easy fix with some hot glue. He doesn't seem to mind though, and this hasn't stopped him from playing with the car."
3,Not for flexible joins,"I'm sure this is a great calk as far as vinyl adhesive calks go, what with the mold-resistance. It bonds fine. It's very easy to work with. But vinyl adhesive calks are too brittle when cured if you have a joint that is at all flexible, for example a formica panel, or something that expands a lot with temperature changes.This is common knowlege for some people, but producers should really indicate better on the labels what the calk is and is not good for, perhaps suggesting one of their other formulations.If you need something that can flex, look for a pure vinyl or silicon calk. The former is easier to work with (stretches like mozzerella) but getting harder to find on shelves these days -- that does emit a LOT of fumes.Ingredients of this calk: ethyline glycol, phthalate esters, n-butyle acetate, vinyl acetate, acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, ehtyl acrylate, acrylonitrile, acrylamide, crystalline silica -- you'll want to keep the room ventilated for weeks afterwards."
3,Not as good as Pillsbury Funfetti,"The rainbow chip is okay. Everyone one in the family felt the Pillsbury Funfetti tasted better. I had high hopes for this product, because it looks delicious unfortunately looks can be deceiving. It is not disgusting, just not tasty enough to justify purchasing it again."
4,"A classic of math logic, sans philosophy","This book is a bit of an elegy to a dying world: the math logic of the 20th century.It does not cover any nonclassical or philosophical logic, directions heavily researched in recent decades. Algebraic logic is slighted, even though Mendelson was an authority on Boolean algebra. Nor does he do justice to the model theoretic perspective, although the treatment of the Tarski semantics for first order logic in chpt. 2 is a bit of a classic. The treatment of recursion in chpts. 3 and 5 are thorough. The set theory of chpt. 4 is a bit unconventional (NBG rather than ZF) but is well exposited. My overall complaint is the crabbed notation, altho he's come a long way since the first edition. The book also cries out for a more graceful English style and page layout. Here Machover (1996) stands out.Mendelson's bibliography is wonderfully long and rich. Finally, this text contains perhaps the gentlest extant introduction to second order logic."
2,*tsk *tsk *tsk,"I bought this book, hoping that it would give me some insite into certain questions I had on little 'trivial (yet annoyingly persistant) question that arose with the House Party expansion pack.This book was obviously nothing near what I had been hoping for! Yes, it gave you a printed out list on the pricing of ALL the objects in the game, but who on Earth would need that?!?! I derived nothing I did not allready know from this game, which made me a firm believer I had wasted my money.The Sims is not an RPG, there is no *MIND BOGGLEING* test that you must accomplish to be able to proceed in the game. Having a guide takes away from the experience of discovering new things to do--BY YOUR SELF!Heed my warning, avoid this book and discover things for yourself!"
2,This book has mistakes in it and left out several secrets!,"This strategy guide is good for those who have limited experience with The Sims. I'd say 95% of the book is common knowledge for those who have been playing the game for a while. The party score section is useful, but the book has several mistakes in it. For example, it states that there is 1 way to have a baby in the game, there is actually 3; it lists 10 career tracks but there are 15. I buy these guides for the hidden stuff and I was extremly dissapointed with this one. The book only discussed in full the campfire secret, it completely overlooked the pink gorrilla, boxer etc.. and did not give any details about the celebrity guest other than to acknowlege that he's in the game. Buy House Party, don't buy the book."
4,Good Leisurely Read,"I was pleasantly surprised at how conversational & easy this book was. Black provides a relaxed story-telling w/ occasional personal attitudes towards what the band has to say/do.What is refreshing is that, unlike other writers, he doesn't just fawn over the band and agree with whatever they have to say or do. Occasionally, he'll disagree or throw a contrary opinion in there worth considering.I give it a B+. Insightful, yet fun and light. Great coffee-table book"
3,Gets Dull Fast,"The problem with this game is that after about 90 minutes it seems like you're doing the same thing over and over again.It gets thrown into the junk pile.The only thing that's not REALLY tedious is the create scenario (or skater) options, and even that dosn't cut it after an hour.You can buy this game, but don't expect it to stay good for more than a week."
4,www.myspace.com/pushtothenegative,"i am a solo artist trying to form my own band so i can start playing my songs live. i bought this dvd so i coud start preparing my voice for live shows, and thats exatly what its good for. some of the past reviews i've read mention that there's too much footage of bands mentioning how great melissa cross is. i will sadly agree, but still even with this problem, i learned things that will benefit me and keep my voice in good shape. keep in mind, if you dont know how to scream, and you want to learn, its something that takes time and practice. this dvd is mainly to help strengthen your singing before getting into the heavier stuff, which is what i'm sure she'll cover in her next dvd."
2,"80% advertisement, 20% duh","This two and a half hour long ""instructional"" video could have been 20 minutes long if they took out all the testimonials and BS. Of the remaining 20 minutes, only about five minutes of it is new information to anyone who has ever played an instrument or been in elementary school choir.Also: volume normalization, for gods sake! My ears are bleeding from the back and forth between quiet talking and ""lessons"" you have to turn your head phones way up to hear and then deafeningly loud screaming and guitar riffs in between.Waste of money and time."
5,EXCELLENT!,Didnt know what I did with out them? oh yeah i do... used rope and other cables. These tie down extensions work great for hauling motorcycles and ATVs
4,Neat item.,Keeps my chrome safe when I haul the bike. What can I say. It works. Not very fast shipping but arrived just in time for me haul the bike south without damage to the chrome or paint.
1,Not Good,"My fiancee and I tried out various flavors of Endangered Species chocolate in the hopes of giving them out as wedding favors. I tend to only review items I think are pretty good, but in this case I have to say that the Endangered Species Peanut Butter bar was the worst chocolate bar I ever have eaten in my life. It tasted like plastic was melted in. Truly horrible."
2,not worth the time,"Yes, this book has a wide variety of recipes from many South American countries. But most of them are unbelievably elaborate and time consuming. His recipe for dulce de leche requires about 5 hours of constant stirring! The few recipes that I've had the time to try haven't even been all that good. Buy this book only if you have many hours to devote to cooking. For basic South American cooking, the book by Myra Waldo is much better."
3,Kara-- Much Ado About Nothing,"This book is about a group of people who live around the Renaissance time period. There are four couples. The main ones are Beatrice and Benedick, and Hero and Claudio. Beatrice and Benedick always fight, but deep down they love each other. Hero and Cladio know that they love each other, but the enemy Don John tries to mess up their relationship.I thought this book was okay, but it was kind of hard to understand. I don't recommend this book unless you have someone who can explain everything to you, or if you can understand it yourself. It is a hard book, but very interesting."
2,Adrienne,"Much Ado About Nothing was difficult to follow because it was writen in Old English. Reading the novel was interesting because it was more challenging than what I'm used to reading. The plot was good and well-formed. Don Pedro came up with a plan to get Beatrice and Benedick together. Benedick swore he'd never get married but, by the end of the novel, Beatrice and Benedick and Claudio and Hero are all married. Don Pedro is the only one left without a wife. The novel ends happily with marriage, dancing, and the capture of Don John. Much Ado About Nothing is a great book by one of America's most famous writers, William Shakespeare. This novel is a wonderful piece of literature that everyone should read at least once in a lifetime."
2,Much Ado About Nothingby Rachel K.,"Much Ado About Nothing by William Shakespeare was an okay book. The old English was hard to understand but the plot was more interesting. In the book, Don Pedro, the prince, and his illegitimate brother, Don John have come to visit the governor of Messina, Italy after being at war. Don John lost this fight to Don Pedro. Claudio, one of Don Pedro's men, is in love with Leonato's, the governor's, daughter, Hero. Don Pedro decides to help Claudio By wooing Hero in Claudio's name and asking Leonato for permission to marry her. Don John and his men plot against this plan and say that Don Pedro wants Hero for himself. This kind of drama and controversy like this continue throughout the book."
3,Teen Idol,"I didn't like this book as much as I thought I would, because I couldn't relate to Jen, the main character. In Meg's other books, I can usually relate to her characters. Take, for example, Sam from ""All-American Girl."" I have the same views on our generation as she does. Suze from ""Mediator"" and I have the same sort of sarcasm, and Jess from ""1-800-Where-R-You"" and I aren't afraid of what other people thinking. But Jen was just a little too plain for me to like.Also, this book wasn't as funny as Meg's others. It had me giggling in a few parts, but not as much as I would have hoped.On the plus side, I thought that Meg developed the character Luke Striker very well. His views on his acting were right on. I won't give anything else away, for I won't spoil some part of the book.Overall, the book was good. Just good."
5,Cabot is my idol!,"Cabot has done it again! She has a way of writing so truthfully that this 30-something mom of three had to keep checking the jacket picture to make sure she's not a teenager in disguise. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll wish you were back in high school again... NOT!"
3,"Not bad, not bad","I bought this book the day it came out. i think Teen Idol was a great, fluffy read, but the only problem is that it was a little predictable.I mean not all of it was, but I have a feeling that Meg Cabot was a on a deadline and had to finish the book. I think that it had great lessons to be learned(be more active in your school, stand up for others, etc.) but it lacked the wit and charm that All American Girl had. I know not all books have to be the same, but still. While it does beat Princess Diaries, this book is sadly, not my favorite.Look out for Cabot's next release: Ready or Not: An All American Girl novel hit stores this summer!"
4,Just Another Review,"Teen Idol by Meg Cabot was a fairly predictable book. It was about a junior, Jenny Greenley, who was friends with just about everyone in her school. She was on the school's newspaper. She also knew how to solve, just about everyone's problems. When she was called to the guidance counselor's office, she was given a special task. The next day, she met Luke Striker, new teen heart-throb. She learned a few things about Luke and about herself. Meg Cabot had some every day issues teens have now, and that is what I liked about her books. She knew exactly what some problems teens were going through, and I could relate to them. In this book, I related a lot with Jenny, but some of the problems were dragged on a little too much, and some solutions were rushed. During part of the book, I was bored and had the urge to skip the pages. All-in-all, the book was fairly good, just not one of her best books that I've read."
1,rubbish,Mr Stanek uses the Internet to self promote himself. i found one of his sites and was so annoyed that i had to come back and chalk up anotehr one star to counter the 5 stars he puts in for himself. Do not buy this book. Anything esle would have to be better.
1,fake,"Mr Stanek wrote the glowing reviews and, I would say,rubbished similar books Amazon offer. Don't waste your money."
5,BUY this book! You WON'T regret it!,The best decision I EVER made was to buy this book! The book saved me money immediately. You really can promote your web site without spending money. WOW!
2,Disappointing,"I wanted to love this product. It's so hefty and shippy. But it sheds very little light. The bars running vertically along the cage block more light than it seems they should. No matter how high I raised the flame, the lamp didn't illuminate the cabin of even my tiny Montgomery 17 sailboat. The search for mellow, gimbaled, oil-based illumination continues . . ."
1,Dim!,"I have a friend who has an oil lamp for his boat, about the same size as this. It is not Weems and Plath but probably a lot cheaper. I bought this lamp hoping to get the same warm glow in the cabin of my boat as he has in his (both 30' boats). I got the premium oil, high quality, put it in the lamp and lit it. I was very disapointed!!! I let it burn for over an hour thinking the wick might need some conditioning. I could not read a book 2ft away from this lamp. It also oscillated, went from dim to dimmer every 2 seconds or so. This was in still air. I am returning this lamp!!!"
2,Boring,"I wanted to like it, but I gave it five chapters and nothing really happened. The characters are indistinguishable., the dialogue dull and pedantic."
5,EXCELLENT,"We LOVE this book, we play out the little roles of each animal and along with it learn the parts of the body and the movements. We have a lot of fun with this and laugh every time we read it together."
5,very fun!,"My 16 month old loves to turn his head like a penguin, thump his chest like a gorilla, and wave his arms like a monkey along with this book!"
5,great,"fast shipment, great quality,....i was very impressed with my entire experience while ordering this book and receiving it as well"
3,"Good, but pricey","These grommets certainly do their job, but I'm not sure they're worth the $70,000 pricetag. I bought 2, just to be safe, and have a twinge of buyers remorse since I never even opened the second. I'd be willing to sell it, second-hand for $50k, if anyone is interested."
5,A Great Performance,"if there were a different medium for this release to be sold as, i'd have it be a play. the album wasn't composed with this in mind, but the final product plays like some sort of strange musical. you'd think that all the songs were composed by different people, because of all the musical ground that it covers. while remaining generally jazz, it bounces all over the place. kind of like this review. the first few songs are standalone masterpieces of sonic genius. the rest of the album is a chilled out dub jazz soundscape, that you don't want to be released from when it finally ends. pick this one up, and have some fun listening."
4,potential,"this is the first album ive picked up from food and i was impressed. i felt the whole album from beginning to end but i couldnt help also feel that he was holdin back quite a bit. however, it is a good buy worthy of your dollars in my opinion. its still original and unique and thats the reason i listen to and love music. thank you. enjoy"
4,Not Bad....,I didnt buy it but I heard all the songs from a friend. Honestly it's a fun album...could have been better if Bernie was an outfielder for the San Francisco Giants...but the Yanks will do!Maybe Bonds has something...
4,Review,I am a big Yankees fan so I got this CD to see if Bernie can write music. This is a definite success. He is an expert on the guitar and there are many catchy tunes. I give this 4 stars just because it's not an amazing 5 star classic cd. It is a quality album.
2,Good but...,"Except for the last cut (""Williams Kids"") the CD is great. Everything it's advertised to be. The last cut on the CD killed it entirely. Having the Williams kids, however cute they may be, on a jazz CD was totally inappropriate. The mood created by the other cuts was completely destroyed by the last cut. But for the fact that I received the CD as a Christmas gift, I would have tossed it in the trash."
2,I Am Shocked At How Bad This Cd Is.,"I can since that there are alot of Yankee fans reviewing this cd not on the basis of the music, but on the performance of a ball player on a field. Let's get serious, this cd stinks. If this is the best that he can do. He is in serious trouble. All of the songs sound the same. There is no one song that stands out, they all sort of mesh together. He does have the ablity to play, but he is one dimensional. He should have waited to put this out when his music developed a little more. He has no style, there is nothing that says ""hey that's bearnie"". When you hear Boney, you know it's him. When you hear Pat Matheny you know it's him, they have a unique style. When you hear this you just say. I wasted money."
2,Not what I thought,"The CD is ok but the name of it is TAI CHI and I purchased it to teach Tai Chi however the first song goes into fast ""rap"" type music and it's almost unusable for me."
1,HORRIBLE,"I see I'm not alone with my review of this book. If I could give this book 1/2 a star I would. I usually like Shelby Lewis, but this book had to be her WORST. The first chapter was the best chapter, after that it just confusing, and I had to FORCE myself to skim through this book searching for the decent parts. The only reason I have this book is because I'm part of the book club. After today it will become friends with the trash can."
4,Its not as good as the new ones,"Tony Hawks Pro Skater 3 is not fun after you have played Tony Hawks Pro Skater 4, Tony Hawks Underground or Tony Hawks Underground 2 because in the new ones your not timed untill you pick a goal. In Tony Hawks Pro Skater 3 you timed from the begining and you have to do something in about 3 minutes. Unless you love Tony Hawk games dont buy this. Save your money."
1,Stick with THPS2,"Of course being a fan of THPS1&2 I got THPS3......... big mistake. I should have known that scince tony hawk2 was MUCH harder(but still possible) that tony hawk1, that tony hawk3 would have been way too hard. I do not recommend this game to anyone!!! They have these stupid missions that will get you frustrated off your ... and you will have the game on mute all the time because it has a soundtrack that nobody can enjoy AT ALL. I literally threw this game away, please take my word into consideration."
2,Very Suprised - Very Disapointed,"I would have to say i was disapointed after playing Tony Hawks Pro Skater 3. I have the second one and i love it. The grafiucs are good, music is fine, bla bla bla. But the game is just flat out hard. It has stupid, nearly impossible missions and tasks. The tricks you could do in the second were totally different. Its a good game for people who have the patience and the devotion to constantly work on a game to beat the first few levels. I think people just gave it 4s and 5s because they don't want to sound like Pu**ies for not being able to do anything. My friends and I all gave it a 2 out of 5. We'll stick to Grand Theft Auto 3.. Now theres some fun right there..."
4,No Complaints,"This is one of the BEST airbrushes on the planet and it will be the ONLY kind i ever use in my airbrushing work.I was very happy with the delivery time it took and the packeging it was in,the box is already peeling the fake wood sticker it is covered with but im just going to peel it all off and airbrush my own design on it...If you want a good product then get this one if your serious about airbrushing..."
2,"Good to be aware of, even if you're a Trinitarian","This book is a comprehensive attack on Trinitarianism in the Bible (or a defence of Unitarianism in the Bible, whichever you like). From a Trinitarian viewpoint, Buzzard and Hunting are helpful if only for gaining an understanding of where my Unitarian (e.g. Jehovah's Witness) friends are coming from, though I remain unconvinced. If you're looking for something which comprehensively sets out the arguments for believing that God is not a Trinity, then this book will be helpful. Personally I gained a greater appreciation of how important it is that God is Father, Son and Holy Spirit through having my views challenged by this book."
5,Nothin But the Taillights,Another great collection by the incredibly talented Clint Black. There's nothing to dislike about this! I would highly recommend this CD to any country music lover!
5,The Best Songwriter in the World!,"Gary Barlow is here once again with a fab album ... this paticular set includes some of the b-sides, which are not featured on the 'normal' version of Open Road ... this CD is absolutely worth listening to ... even if you didn't like Take That you have to remember this is not them this is Gary Barlow doing what he does best - singing!"
2,Works but the arm is far too weak.,"Just received my Nady MPF-6 6"" clamp on microphone pop filter and immediately I'm disappointed by the arm. The clamp works as it should, the pop filter works but unfortunately that's where it stops being good. The arm just plain doesn't work. It's by far too weak and possibly only works if standing completely straight up. My microphone is attached to a boom so I can use it easily while sitting, however the arm on the Nady MPF-6 makes it completely unusuable. With a better arm this would be a 5 star, however with such a weak arm it's completely incapable of doing it's job."
1,The gooseneck arm will not support the weight of the filter.,"I may have received a lemon however I noticed I wasn't the only one who is complaining about the gooseneck arm. It just doesn't support the weight of the pop filter. No matter how I positioned this thing, the filter would always sag."
4,nady pop filter review,"made all of my recordings sound a lot better and gives them a more professional feel. Goes great with almost any professional mircrophone and was marked at a fair price, recommend to anyone looking for a good pop filter."
3,Alright,"Awesome at reducing P's, B's and T's but a bit overpriced.You have to buy a stand for it otherwise there's nowhere to clip on."
3,gooseneck is a little weak,"All okay except gooseneck is a little weak, i.e., it does not keep the pop filter in place as rigidly as it should. But I like the lightweight and the price."
1,Complete Junk.,"The package was falling apart, the item was cheap and junky, and had a terrible chemical/plastic/whatever odor to it that I couldn't put my finger on. I didn't even bother to try returning it, opting instead to throw the item away and pretend I never laid eyes on it."
3,It works...,"This product does exactly as it says it does, clamps to a microphone stand, or anything you can get it around. However, instead of paying the 16 dollars here you can get the same effect using a 2$ set of nylons and a 3$ sewing loop. It effectively reduces the pop on my microphone, but is overpriced for what it is. It is this humble person's opinion that one could get an emulated effect if they took a little time and energy to make this themselves."
1,Not even worth the small amount of money.,"I've received and tried out the filter, (even though it was poorly packaged, also mentioning the fact that the package has been stapled.. as in its been USED when I clearly ordered for a NEW filter. Plus the neck was held by a old rubber band.) the gooseneck does not work very well. The neck is not as tight as I wanted it to be. This product AND the seller, is not worth the small amount of money."
3,Pop goes the pop filter,I was told I should get a pop filter for my desk mike that way when I say words like Peter piper picked a pickled pepper my mic won't get over driven. All I can say a pop filter is not for every one. Being a radio operator I know how to talk into a microphone without over driving. So you make the call if you think you need a pop filter or not in my case not really just extra money blown.
4,Get this for your microphone,"I do a lot of podcasts and dubbing over videos, and after using this filter, the pop that occurs with P's and B's in the voice are basically gone. It makes your audio more professional when you eliminate these annoyances."
4,"Its perfect just one slight concern, not a big deal though","very fast shipping, got this in 2 days. opened and it fit perfectly on my mic stand. the only problem that not a big issue i think is the nobs where you adjust the pop filter its self. it wobbles a lil and becomes loose over time. JUST SAYING. but over all, its a great deal."
4,good product,"good product... not much more to say, other than it does what its supposed to do... a good product all around."
3,"it""s just ok",thought it would do better with my popping P's but I really didn't notice any change if any. Not sure I would buy this product
5,GREAT GAME,"This is definentely the BEST Ace Combat game ever made. It is personally my favorite air combat game. The game itself is extremly exciting and intense. The new storyline is cool and it had great art, but it's rather corny. The planes are cool looking although there isnt much difference between the best aircraft and the worst aircraft. This game is by far better than the new Top Gun game."
4,great game,"its a really good game, I'm not a big fan of this type of games, but I really enjoyed it."
5,Pre-Publication edition was very good,"I used the self published, pre-pub test version before it was officialy published and it was truly excellent, such that the finished product must be even better!"
5,Excellent - a Mind opener,"After reading this book and listening to the audio tape as well...I must say I was transformed. I used her tape to guide my meditations, during which I had a vision of my sister in the hospital. I called home and found out my sister was in emergency surgery and had almost died. If we just open our mind, it's amazing what we can see."
2,Terrible.,"This, without a doubt, is the worst textbook I have ever read. Not only is the grammar extremely poor, but basically all of the information is taken from the WWW. Instead of buying this book, I recommend that you go to www.allmusic.com and go through the music eras--you'll learn more. In fact, the author of this horrible excuse for a history book even admits to taking most of his information from Allmusic.Horrible, horrible book."
2,Disappointed,"DO NOT buy this if camcorder your computer does not have a Firewire/IEEE 1394 DV Terminal. Our computer is only 7 months old and we do not have this Firewire connection, so we went to Best Buy to get a $50 converter cable so we could transfer the videos and burn DVD's. No luck, even with the extra cable, the videos require Firewire connection to transfer to the computer. I have returned the Elura after this discovery and ordered the Sony DCR-DVD108 DVD Handycam Camcorder with 40x Optical Zoom. This one records directly to the mini DVD's and plays perfectly on DVD players and the computer. Plus I can burn extra DVD's to send to family. Highly recommend the Sony, but not this Canon Elura."
4,Picture is great but there is noise,"For this price range, the picture is great. I can also verify the noise from the motor of this camera. But, I also had a similar noise problem with my Canon ZR-20 (which I still own and use). Personally, I don't use MiniDV's for their audio and if I needed to, I'd go for some external solution.Bottom line, I paid $800+ for my ZR-20 in 2001, and now for $349, I got an ""upgraded"" image, much smaller footprint, AND the ability to use an SD card for additional video.Nice pocket video camera, but there is some noise...."
4,Canon Elura 100,"In general I am extremely pleased with this item. I had not had a movie camera since a sony bulky super 8. THis camera is super small and generally easy to use. I would have appreciated a ""Quick set up page"" . Instead you need to actually read much of the manual !. I still am unclear why there is a movie tape and a SD card to choose between. I think they could have included one movie tape and a samll card so that you could ""shoot right out of the box"". You also need to buy a case. That would only add a few dollars to the price. The quality of the film is what I had expected, good but not fantastic. Transfering to TV or computer was easy as long as you have the right plugs available. I would recommend this camera. Great value for the price"
5,Great Camcorder And Affordable,"Purchased this camcorder for my daughter's family. She finds it very easy to use and lightweight so she can carry it to school functions easily. The tapes are readily available and easy to find. However, as time goes by, this format will become obsolete so don't buy it for the long haul. Nothing lasts that long these days anyway. I would recommend this camcorder as my daughter is taking nice movies of my grandchildren!"
2,Motor Noise Unbearable,I second the review below. Overall the I liked the size and features of this camera. The only reason it went back was due to the motor noise being picked up by the camera microphones. Even my wife who is essentially tone deaf picked up on the noise in the background. Tried two different cameras with the same result. I have owned two Canon still cameras and been very happy. I am very disappointed that Canon would release a product with this type of design flaw.
2,Annoying motor noise!,"I ordered the camera from Crutchfield on a Saturday and the camera came on Friday. I read reviews about motor noise but decided to buy it anyway. I should have listened to the reviews on Amazon.com, I noticed motor noise also. It was annoying to hear while recording, also while playing back on the computer or TV.I returned the Cannon to Crutchfield and ordered a Panasonic PV-GS300 camcorder from Amazon.com. Virtually silent operation, could not hear the motor noise at all during playback. The picture quality is excellent since it has three CCD's.I would not recommend buying this camera since the motor noise is annoying, and my fianc? heard the noise too."
3,but why???,"So after having this camera a couple months and filling up my first video cassette, I have been pretty happy with the performance. However, I come to learn that I have to purchase a seperate cable in order to transfer video to my computer...how cheap can you be, canon? I paid $400 for a camera, give me a d*mn dv cord to put this thing to work. I will be returning this, my first ever canon, and going back to sony. I'll stick with the brand I can trust"
2,It's good for the cost,"I just got this camara yesterday. Having never previously owned one I was quite naive in my selection even after having read pages of reviews.The directions were easy enough to follow and it was up and running in a short time.The playback noise is not really so bad. It exists, but is only evident if there is no other sound. The ability to attach a microphone that does not need to be held would be beneficial.Similarly, it would be nice to be able to attach a light. The mega light helps but is not very ""mega"".The strap seems hard to adjust. The camera is difficult to hold and I have been using both hands.On the positive side, the zoom is great, the steady shot feature is very helpful and the videos are good.It's not a $3,000 camera so why expect it to perform as one. It does a fine job for the price. You need to shop for the features you want most as they won't all be on one machine in this price range.Good luck!"
2,Motor noise not acceptable,"The Elura 100 had all the features I wanted, but the unit I ordered had unacceptable motor noise. It was always present even when recording video with normal talking. I returned the camera and will look for another brand to purchase."
5,abc fun!,"My daughter loves these, she gets a new alphabet stamp every day, perfect for learning her ABC'S :)"
3,Use google...,"Unfortunately, you can find all of this info on google. If you want an easy straighforward way to learn about colors and to get some dye techniques then try this book but most of this info is readily available online."
4,Awsome Voice Wonderful Artist!,"This is great CD for anyone that really appreciates good country music. Lari was never truly recognized for the talent she has. If vocals are your thing, Lari has a beautiful voice. Lari is also a wonderfully talented writer. This is a fun album that is worth checking out. It's one of those albums that you enjoy the first time, but you truly appreciate and LOVE it more and more each time you hear it."
5,Not just for IT,"Do not mistake brevity for lack of insight. This may be a slim volume, but you'll find more valuable, real-world advice here than in a host of weightier tomes, leavened as always with Bob's well-known dry humor. The clarity he brings to the essence of leadership is refreshing and valuable for all leaders, not just those focusing on IT. This isn't a how-to book; it's an expression of the eight basic principles that matter, placed into context with enough guidance and thought-provoking comments to let you apply them to your own situation. It should be standard issue to leaders at all levels of all organizations."
1,Very smartass outlook...,"...& very much in love with itself but as so many have already pointed out: All Context, No Substance. Interesting that Andersen was editor of Spy & New York Mag, 2 of the most sophomoric smug periodicals around."
3,Hello Diminishing Returns,"What starts off as a compelling blend of characters and situation rapidly becomes confusing, unrealistic, and worse, boring.Heck, I can work up sympathy for our female lead when we think she's going to have to sell out her company for $13 million instead of the expected $35 million, as Anderson asks us to. I can even work up a little sympathy for the travails of our male lead, even though ""failing"" in his case means he'll have to fall back on the profits of the ""Homicide""-esque show he co-created.But what's with boring me, Kurt? I don't want to give away anything in this review -- the above has been discussed in numerous reviews -- but the plot utterly fails to achieve anything like a dramatic apogee. Instead, the otherwise-fascinating Mr. Anderson relies on a narrative that twists and turns without ever attempting anything as straightforward as liftoff.Is the author afraid of allowing himself to simply tell us a story? From such promising beginnings, I expected better."
1,The View is not Worth the Climb,"After thrilling to the first 100 pages or so, I waited for some semblance of a plot to begin. I'd seen Charlie Rose interview the author, became intrigued, and bought this book in hardcover, breaking one of my cardinal rules. After 400 pages of snide media references and product placements,I gave up, realizing that the characters were too steeped in their cliches to become 3 dimensional, and if any plot were to develop this late in the game, it would not be worth it. All Style, no substance."
2,The perfect book for those . . .,"Lame. Revealing a knowledge of literature that begins and ends with Tom Wolfe, Kurt Anderson makes a self-conscious, overblown bid for upper-middle-brow media stardom. Smug, heavy handed, infested with trendy cliché-ridden observations and held together by shockingly feeble comic set pieces, 'Turn of the Century' is an exasperating read that continually reminds the reader of how much better Don Delillo handled similar material, a full ten years ago, in his vastly superior 'White Noise'. Two stars may seem like an excessively generous grade for Anderson's limpid debut novel, but an incontestable fact remains: Kurt Anderson has, indeed, succeeded in writing the perfect book for those who think Maureen Dowd is witty and Evelyn Waugh was a woman. (Something of an accomplishment in light of said target group's immense cultural influence in publishing circles and elsewhere.)"
2,Pretty much a waste of a lot of time,"Well, if you,ve checked the first 68 reviews you don't need mine, but... the book is sporatically (very sporatically) amusing and I don't find it plotless as others do-it's that the characters are paper thin. I think that is the main roblem. Also, 400 pages would have provided enough space for the ""better stuff."""
3,"Shallow characters, ironic humor; still, compelling","Yes, the characters are blanks; Anderson gives us no clue as to their motivations or self-awareness (do they realize how empty their lives are?). And the humor is not really funny, but rather a kind of ironic parade of contemporary foolishness.I finished the whole book knowing I hated the characters and everything they (apparently) stood for. And yet ... it is a compelling read, because of Anderson's dead-on aim at turn-of-the-century obsessions. It's a dead-on portrait of a small, self-obsessed, maybe over-rated segment of society, and that's what made it hard to put down."
3,Not enough songs I like,"I love KT Oslin, but this CD didn't have a lot of her hits on it, my error in buying."
5,A Personal Experience of Hindu Devotion,"This is not the book for a reader who is looking for an understanding of the soaring intellectual complexity and nuance of Vedic philosophy.This is not the book for a reader who is looking for a critique of Hindu fundamentalism, the social problems arising from the caste system.But for the reader who is attracted to the beauty of a simple faith that permeates everyday life, Meeting God is the most beautifully written, moving book imaginable.Huyler is a social anthropologist who is interested in the small artifacts of Indian life--clay pots, butter lamps, house idols. It is this interest in the small, the homely, the daily ritual, that informs this beautiful account of daily devotion in the lives of over a billion people on the Indian subcontinent.Stephen Huyler's photography is exquisite, his descriptions moving and true, and his love for the culture he describes, obvious."
4,The best live Sheryl Crow CD so far,"This is better than Live in Central Park or Sheryl Crow in Concert. I think Crow is so much better live than studio recordings. Excellent CD, essential for her big fans."
3,"Lots of info, example vague",I believe this book is full of good Struts information however the idea that you will learn it by building a sample application is just not true. After setting up a development structure in chapter two the author leaves you on your own to figure out where to put the files your creating or modifying. Although you can figure this all out on your own it detracts and distracts you from focusing on the real details he is trying to teach you. Also there is no readme.txt in the downloads from the apress site as is written in chapter two. All in all this is only an average text for learning struts due to the lack of direction with the examples.
1,Doesn't take you anywhere beyond basics,"I purchased this book after seeing so many 5 star reviews for this book only to be thoroughly disappointed.Ironic it is named Pro Struts. Didnt take me anywhere beyond the beginner level, far from making me a Struts Pro."
3,"Okay book, Not great",Bought this after seeing so many good reviews.This is a okay book. May be 3 stars.Lots of room for improvement.Every rating with a 5 star - Sure sounds fishy to me
4,Great TV,"This is a great TV. Looks nice and has a wonderful picture. Big and heavy as most tube TV's are, though. Also, there is no S-video or HDMI plug in. Sound is a little tinny, but still a great price for this combo unit. Came without a scratch!"
3,Too extensive!,"Too much unnecessary information (that you won't be tested on) is crammed into this book. A far better choice would be _Cracking_the_GED_, which is published by The Princeton Review."
1,very dissapointed! item never received,"as of today 10/20/08 I still have not received my purchased item. I have not received an email from the seller explaining the delay. I have requested a full refund from the seller and I have not heard anything yet. VERY, VERY UPSET!"
1,Not distinctive,"Sorry to everyone who is a fan of Kany... I just didn't like this cd. I was hoping for a unique latin sound, but it's just a run of the mill pop recording with no special flavor. For now I'm sticking with Juanes, Mana, and Reik when I need a Latin Pop fix!"
3,Nice compilation of Latin Pop Rock,"This is a pleasant album, not too shocking, not too boring. Kany has a nice melodious voice and the beats are pretty good, as well as the guitar work. I only know a little Spanish, but it seems quite funny that she sings about a friend in the bathroom Track 3 ""Amigo en el Bano"". Wonder what that's about?"
3,Does a little,"I have been using this for about 5 months now and am not sure if I'm purchasing again. It seems that it is making my existing hairline a little fuller but it's not growing hair where there isn't any. Overall I like it, I just don't know if its worth the price. If you have the extra money to spend I suggest giving it a 6 month try. I'm nearing the end of my third bottle and am still debating purchasing another."
3,"You're the guy from Home Alone, right!?","Chris Elliot's first 'novel' is written with the same surreal sense of humor asGet a LifeandCabin Boy. Chances are if you liked those, you will enjoy his fiction as well. The book was chock full of bizarre, laugh out loud moments for me.At the same time I do think that the story was so silly that it was a bit of a strain carrying it on for three hundred and sixty eight pages. I loved the lunacy of his writing and would have to say that for me it stayed consistently funny throughout, but I think his fiction would work better in a book of short stories."
1,Too precious by half,"I was really hoping for more, I like Chris Elliot! But this book seriously disappointed me. It's too precious for it's own good, with self-conscious wordplay that tries too hard to be funny and characters constructed solely for the purpose of jokes that never pay off. Like Saturday Night Live skits of late, it probably sounded better when it was pitched.The reviews here comparing this to The Da Vinci Code aren't even in the ballpark - the ""mystery"" in this book is a bare skeleton that never takes life. It's more like Daniel Pinkwater on a very bad day. The only time the book is mildly amusing is when the story flashes forward to modern times with Elliot poking fun at his own low wattage celebrity-hood. Maybe there's a book there - but not here."
4,Jim Gaffigan Comedy CD,"This arrived in great time, well packaged with no problems. This CD is hilarious and although he says I few things I object too, most times Jim Gaffigan is very funny. I listen to it in my car driving my kids back and forth to school and I think other parents must think i'm nuts because I'm sitting in my car laughing my head off... c'est la vie... anyway, I am really enjoying it, thank you and thank you to jim gaffigan."
1,It's a turd,"The Emjoi is a waste of money. I tried it and it is painful and just does not grab the hair. I finally replaced it with a Braun.Want details?It is loudIt does not grab the hair wellIt is very painful - more so than older coil-type epilatorsI really don't feel the need to add more details. These metal-metal rotary ""tweezer"" type epilators Do. Not. Work.In other words, it is a turd."
5,Perfect Replacement Excellent construction.,"I love this new hose, I was using and taping up my old 24 year old hose for five years. Not only is it lighter weight but it now has a handle off and on switch. The metal ends have a nice thick plastic sleeve so the ends aren't sharp metal. Slides across the carpet smoother, I love it. Sorry I didn't make this replacement years ago. I Love Amazon for making so many products available."
5,what he said!,"I agree with the first review. This is the best of Namlook/Laswell's collaborations, and one of the very best on the german FAX label it was released on. I'm surprised it's still possible to find a copy with the limitation of 2000."
5,Replacement Arrows ARE Available,"We've owned this toy for about 8 months and I have to say I'm impressed with it's durability. My 8-year-old son still enjoys playing with it. However, we are down to one arrow left (it is true, the fins do tear off). I could not find replacement arrows online; however a quick call to Hasbro (1-800-255-5516) and I was able to buy six replacement arrows for $1.00 each. The transaction with Hasbro was very easy and quick."
4,Nerf Big Bad Bow,My grandson loved this Nerf Bow. Everything was fine except for slow shipping and that was due to Christmas.
3,O.K. nerf gun,"this is a overall ok nerf gun,but the arrows do shred and are sort of fragile. I got it for christmas and was thrilled until i saw that they only give you 3 NERF ARROWS! I would not reccomend it to anybody."
1,don't buy it - you can not replace the arrows,"We have owned this bow for over a year. It was great fun until the three darts broke. NOw it will just take up space in a landfill somewhere. You can not get replacement arrows. I've followed all of the instructions of the other raters and the arrows can not be found. Why would a company make a product that needs arrows that they won't sell? Obviously children will lose and break the arrows so they have a guaranteed market to sell them. It really does not make any sense to me. Don't buy this product because there will just be tears in a few weeks when the arrows are broken or get stuck on the roof, etc."
3,No Schoolly D,"In the original version, Schoolly D's song ""Signifying Rapper"" (which ""samples"" Led Zeppelin's ""Cashmere"") plays throughout the film. In this version, the song is replaced by a cheap-sounding rock instrumental. So if ""Signifying Rapper"" being in there is important to you, then I would not recommend this DVD."
2,Boring,This was the cut version. The uncut version was a lot better. This cut version caused this movie to lose its punch
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen.,"Boring, long, slow to develop. Only a drug addict with a serious case of self-loathing could enjoy this terrible movie. Apparently, the PRIME version is edited for content but, at over 2 hours of terrible dialogue, frustratingly slow pacing, cheap 'shock' plot points, and little or no intelligible character development, I would rather shoot myself in the foot than watch the unedited version. The only positive points I can find about this movie are its continued coverage of the Dodgers vs Mets world series and getting to see, briefly, full frontal nudity of Harvey Keitel."
1,Fantastic performance by Keitel,"Yes, a truly memorable performance by Keitel, but apart from that, this film offers nothing. The story is very weak and other performances are forgettable. That's 96 wasted minutes of my life."
1,Junk! It died on me!,Do not buy Sumsung SyncMaster monitors. I bought a 913v and the thing went black after about a year of use. I troubleshooted it but something failed inside. Samsung obviously cut corners with this waste of a monitor. F rating. U for useless.
4,convenience is worth it!,"This product was new to me - I like gingerbread and don't often make it - the flavor profile is not the kids' fave and the spices are not the ones I look at all the time!But these boxes are a nice convenience - be aware that it makes a small batch: a 9x9 pan, 2.5 dozen cookies or as I did a dozen muffins. These have also frozen well!Not as good as homemade but certainly worth the difference in flavor to whip it up in moments!"
1,Medicinal taste,"This is awful. It had an off-putting medicinal taste. Maybe if it was smothered in icing it would be better, but don't waste your money. I made it according to the directions and served it to people at Thanksgiving and not a single person liked it. I threw the whole thing away. It has nice texture and is attractive but the taste of this mix is just wrong."
3,Coaster bar.,Beautiful when put together. A million pieces to put together. Need lots of lifting muscles and be very handy. Glue required or will not be firm. Not recomended for the average person to put together. Thanks.
4,One of the best,"One of the best book about MRP implementation, expecially from the ""information system"" point of view.PS: I read the book in the italian version."
2,You get what you pay for...,"It arrived quickly and well packaged, but the ""unidirectional condenser microphone"" didn't work. I didn't have time to return it before summer camp started, so I relied on the ""hand held CB style mic."" This worked very well--good sound quality and loudness--until the microphone jack broke halfway through the week. Granted, it was at a summer camp for youth so it wasn't exactly treated with kid gloves...But it was still a disappointment. Not the best quality craftsmanship. In no way is it worth the ""list price"" of $60. Luckily, they don't charge that.The tune it plays when you press the music switch is--get this--""jingle bells."" It's pretty awful. Sounds a lot like an holiday-themed car horn, strangely off-season ice-cream-truck or super annoying kids toy. Weird choice of tune.So, I'm not particularly happy with the product, but the seller was prompt and I'm hoping I can take it apart and fix it. We'll see."
4,Andy Stack Rule's' terrifying true read!,"This was a book that I borrowed from a friend..come to think of it...I still have the book (oops) Anyhow....this was a good book written around the time Rule was making a name for herself as Andy Stack. I read this twice. A sadistic monster responsible for the disappearance of beautiful young women who had full lives ahead of them, and would no doubt have been successful had fate not thrown them in Jerry Brudos' path. Thier thin, beautiful fragile bodies were no match for this physically built stong LUST KILLER...this book made me rethink about going out alone, and thanks to one couragous girl in this story...I learned a thing or two...."
4,A Stranger Among Us.,"To his wife and collegues, Jerry Brudos was a man whose mild manner contrasted with his awesome physical strength. But to the police, Jerry Brudo was the most sadistic killer. Ann Rule did a great job with this one. While it is a short read, it is full of grusome details that will keep you wanting to read more."
2,Reason Why,"Here's one of the reasons to avoid greatest hits/best of collections. These are some truly great tracks which have been savaged by some label-hired editor, who cuts large chunks off songs for no particular reason.Everbody should own a copy of ""Samba Pa Ti,"" by the way, one of the truly great guitar tracks, overflowing with delicacy and intensity. A truly erotic instrumental track.One of the best guitar solos in rock, on ""Black Magic Woman,"" can't be heard here though, because the studio hack whacked it off the version on this CD.Buy the original albums and hear the real deal. Columbia blew it on this one."
2,What a tease.,"To echo the sentiments of some of the other reviewers, this CD is a gyp. Many of the most important songs have been shortened. This might as well be a demo CD. I want my $8.97 back."
5,Loved it! Must Read!!,This book is amazing! I've read it about five times and will probably read it again this weekend. Can never get enough of it.
3,Not Catherine Anderson at her best,"Don't get me wrong. I absolutely LOVE Catherine Anderson and think she is a brilliant writer. But this story... just...UGH. It had the potential to be a very good story, but the heroine was SO annoying. To be perfectly honest, if I were the hero, the story would have lasted all of 15 pages because I would have killed the brat and been done. It was just the same conflicts over and over. Also, it's never a good thing when you actually start hoping the heroine dies. I even found myself sometimes telling Loretta, the horoine to shut up out loud. I just have to say Loretta just never redeemed herself for me. I will say, however, that you should read Catherine's other books. ""Keegan's Lady"" and ""Only By Your Touch"" are 2 of my favorite boooks. That is the only reason why this book doesn't have only 1 or 2 stars."
1,Could Not Get Into,This was one of the few books that I read of Catherine Anderson and I really could not get into it at all.
1,boooorrriiiinnnnggg,"Now take my review for what its worth cuz I only made it about 70 pages into this book. Why did I only make it 70 page? Because nothing happens. Thats right. Nothing. Lets talk about these 2 therapists lives, and the people that works for thems lives, and the 12 people coming to a retreat to spend time at the therapists old plantation home....well lets just talk about their lives to. On and on and on. Like I said I got 70 pages into this days of our lives book (that for some reason has a snake lady on the front cover) before I gave up. And oh im pretty sure the monsters were supposed to be zombies, not snake people but I didn't make it that far into this book. Stay away. Stay away. STAY AWAY."
3,"Not Their Best, but pretty good.","Like a lot of people, I thought this band was a one hit wonder; that hit being the ""drinking song"" from Tubthumper. Most people did'nt even bother to listen to the whole CD, which is loaded with great tunes. I found out later about this politically charged band has released several albums. This is the third Chumbawumba CD that I have purchased and it is my third favorite. Most of the tunes are very entertaining but nothing was as memorable as say ""Don't Try This At Home"". But it is much better than most of the ""pop"" music pablum that is currently clogging up the airwaves and record stores. Give it a try, you will probably like it better than I did."
4,Creative makeup,"as a profressional, I do think this is a great book for creative ideas. Not right if you want basic info on colors for skintones, though. Beautiful pictures."
3,Good for inspiration only,"I was looking for a make-up book with steps on how to achieve different looks. I think that was the goal of the book, but in the modern world of youtube, where you can actually watch someone apply make-up step-by-step, this book fell short. Granted, no book will live up to a video, but the description of each make-up look was almost the same. They could have used different pictures for each step at least or given a better description of how to apply them. Having said that, the looks displayed in the book were really inspiring, and the makeovers were dramatic. This book is good for inspiration only."
5,Satisfied,"I'm no professional, but from what I gather, my girlfriend was 100% satisfied with this book as it was so much more than what she expected. I would encourage you to buy"
4,This book rocks!,"I really do know nothing about makeup, but with this book I am really learning. The photos are absolutely beautiful, with step by step instruction on how to attempt recreating each look. I love 'Making Faces' and look forward to purchasing Mr. Aucoin's other books."
5,A wonderful book,Kevyn is an extremely talented make-up artist who gives great tips on how to apply make-up and the right tools to use.I learned a lot of good tips which I use daily.
5,Simply great!,"I've met this book through a friend of mine (mine haven't arrived yet), but all I can say is that book is really great! The stories are warmful and the step-by-step explanations about the makeups are really helpful. One style I adopted for life on daily basis is the nude one created on Winona Ryder... It's perfect!!!Conheci esse livro através de uma amiga minha (o meu ainda no chegou), mas tudo o q posso dizer é q esse livro é realmente ótimo! As histórias so tocantes e as explicaes passo a passo sobre as maquiagens so realmente úteis. Um estilo q adotei pra sempre no meu dia a dia é o neutro/nude feito na Winona Ryder... É perfeito!"
4,Look Nice -- Performance is OK,"Awsome looking vihicle, I wish they built it a bit higher off ground and 4 wheel drive. Powerful, nice, off-road is best describe this baby (*.*)"
4,4.5 stars,the album is great. its just not a cd you can listen to contatntly all the time. but its probably tools best.
4,rrrrocks,"this is a good album. tool's older days are gone and that is apparrent, but you can't deny that they knew they were on the brink of something big. opiate, albeit not their best cd; and in fact i hated it when i first heard it, is pretty sweet. songs like sweat and opiate are two catchy hard hitting songs with interesting lyrics too boot. i could see why somenone gets disappointed the first time they hear this, but i would give at least three more listens before chucking it to the garbage."
4,A half hour of power.,"This early EP might not be as mindblowing as their last few releases, but it packs a powerful punch. It's much more straight forward alt-metal, and not as experimental as say the epic ""Lateralus"". ""Sweat"" is a sweet track, but it's ""Hush"" that makes you realize how good this is. ""Part Of Me"" and the 2 live tracks rock as well. ""Opiate"" is a bit more involved, and is a sign of things to come on the ""Undertow"" album. There's also a hidden track on the cd, but I have this on vinyl, and it's not on that. Though not as essential as their other albums, it's a must for the ""Tool"" fanatic."
5,Early Tool..very good Tool..,"""Opiate"" was Tool's first effort and it's a gem. Not as polished as ""Undertow"" or ""nima"", the songs have a much heavier edge. Maynard's voice doesn't sound as full here as on the later efforts, but it's still great. They music is fantastic, and you can really hear the beginnings of one of the most unique sounds in music today. The Tool sound.""Cold and Ugly"" and ""Jerk-off"" are live and you can hear Maynard interacting with crowd, quite amusing.My favorite song on the album is ""Opiate"", but they are all superb. Enjoy."
5,Brillance,This is only a seven-song EP and obviously can't compare to the epics Undertow and Aenima but the songs on here are extremely good songs and well worth the money.
4,Good start.,"Tool got off to a good start with this EP. Being the bands first release it is not as accomplished or as exploratory as their later releases. If you want to see how the band progressed and also hear some good songs, get this."
3,Tool becomes the new opiate of the masses,"This EP doesn't stack up well against Tool's LP's, which is understandable given their brilliance, but it is still very good. I found it to be too musically generic, and Maynard hadn't fully honed his vocal skills yet, yelling through most of the record, with title track being his finest effort. However, one can clearly see evidence of the lyrical genius that was to come later on in Undertow, Aenima, and Lateralus.If you like angry hard rock (and, honestly, who doesn't?) this is a good, cheap buy. However, if you're looking for something more like the Tool LPs, you'll be suprised, for better or for worse, with what you hear."
4,Opiate,Ahhhhhhhhhh!!! Now there is the Cream filling!!! Back to the old school!!! Love me some Rock & Roll!!!!! Can't wait to get some more TOOL!!!
2,This CD Player is not so good,"It isn't that great, and im not an electronics nerd, i've had the player for a year, and already when you even tap the lid, it skips, during play, it sometimes, just out of nowhere, shuts off. Which means you have to start the song all over again. I'm no electronics nerd, and have no interest in reviews, but I'm just stating my opinion. And the headphones it came with were horrible, and it constantly skips and cannot read disks well at all. It started doing this about 3 or 4 months or so after I had it. Don't buy this."
2,poor translation,"I bought the book in hopes of reading Yiddish authors I have not read before, such as S.Y. Abramovitsh. What I found is essentially unreadable text, with writers being so similar in poor style, that it is hard to imagine that all stories were not written by the same person. For comparison, read Tevye the Dairyman and Railroad Stories in Hillel Halkin's translation. That is, indeed, a fine literature"
2,Minnelli experiment in the bizarre!,"Having watched this film many times hoping for a miracle to occur, I still find this justified flop a failed experiment in movie musical surrealism, overdecorated sets bordering on stifling,and wacky costumes a dull movie experience which never really gets off the ground. The brilliantly conceived dance number ""Coffee Time"" is amazingly innovative and puts the rest of the film to shame. It's sad that all of beautiful Lucille Bremer's efforts were,alas,wasted on this epic Vincent Minnelli flop!"
3,some interesting selections but....,"... all in all the album lacks continuity, and the last two tracks shouldn't be on the album at all. During the years of the classic lineup of Jefferson Airplane (Surrealistic Pillow-Volunteers) they really didn't do any songs that I would call bad, and if you want to get into the group I highly recommend you buy the actual albums. However, if you must have a collection or you just don't know what to buy, ""The Worst of Jefferson Airplane"" is a better place to start."
3,this phone is ok,I do have the phone now here is my pros and consProsthe colorthe sizeConsI don't like the fact thatyou have to deal with finger prints on itI don't like the quality of the camera it sucks it is not clear and it also doesn't have a flashI don't like the fact when you buy ring tones and you set them as a ring tone for a person on your contact list when they call you don't hear that ring you only hear your default ring that you set for everybody else.I am not the only one with this problem I know another person that is having the same problem.
2,"Feels great, Looks great, but really not great","I really wanted to love this phone. It feels great and I used to work for Motorola, so I wanted to have a Motorola phone (after several years perfectly happy with LG phones).First, the camera is awful. I take pictures with my phone to send to my blog frequently, and I don't think I've taken one picture in the 6 months I've owned this phone that hasn't been blurry. It isn't just this handset either. About 4 months after getting this phone, it died suddenly. They gave me a ""new"" one (refurbished), but the photo quality on this one sucks too. I mean... what's the point?So sad... I liked how it looked and felt. The audio quality for conversations is fine. The speech recognition works well. But man... I won't go back to Motorola."
1,DO NOT BUY A KRZR,"I bought 3 krzrs and ALL OF THEM ARE DEFECTIVE. all 3 freeze randomly and the screen goes white frequently. it can not be a coincidence, it can only be a manufacturer defect. how motorola can continue to sell a product they know is defective and can not perform as promised is irresponsible at best. if you want a phone that doesnt work and you cant return because they cant duplicate the problem, then buy a krzr. be sure to buy a second phone so u have one that actually works."
1,Terrible Phone!!!,"I got this phone in October of 2008 and in the begining it was all right. I only had to charge it up and it would last for at least 4 days. Then only weeks later it started to get weaker and weaker and eventually if I wasn't talking on it, it was on the charger. Then as if it couldn't get any better the the dang thing just shuts off when it wants to. It says that it has a low battery and shuts off as if the battery has give out, but only 5 mins. before, it had a full charge. It also continues to do this even after a software upgrade and new battery. And verizon isn't much help either. The guys who sold me the phone and swore how good it was is pretty much telling me now that its not their problem and I don't have another upgrade until October of this year. VERIZON AND THE KRAZR SUCK!!! I swear I'm going to AllTell!!"
1,Music for funeral or deeply depressed people...,"Type o Negative is probely the reason to why we see so many kids killing themselfes and cutting their arms and hating their parents. The music displayed by ton? Is depressing,makes you feel hopeless, depressed, and i hate them because one of my good friends, killed himself after listining to ton's ""life is killing me"" and the music is boring for a purpose...To make you hate yourself and end up commiting suicide or worse. How about listining to music that means something or not being about death all the time? Actullie try to enjoy life while you are alive ?Insted of killing yourself with the sounds of death,sorrow, and, depression. Type of negative's ""life is killing me"" was made for people to get more depress and give them false hope and it worked. Thanx to them? One of my biggest friends is dead. Don't buy this trash."
4,A return to form.,After the somewhat disappointing World Coming Down CD this is definitely a return to form. It is on par with Bloody Kisses. The only problem is that their signature sound you almost think it's an older album. The lyrics as always are great. Looking forward to more great music from Type O Negative. Some of my favorites:I Don't Wanna Be Me: A catchy fast song. Not many lyrics but definitely worth the repeat button on your CD player.Less Than Zero: Slow starter but definitely worth it. The Sitar is certainly appropriate without seeming to be intentionally ecletic.I Like Goils: Funny but a little too fast. They should've made this a little slower....A Dish Best Served Coldly: Solid representation of Type O Negative. Both Angry and Slow at different points.
2,Just didn't grab me at all,"Don't get me wrong, I love Type O Negative more than I can imagine possible. Oct. Rust was a work of sincere genius, Bloody Kisses was purely inspiring, and even the often slammed World Coming Down had siginificantly powerful moments. With this album, I feel that TON just is not taking themselves seriously enough. With ""I Like Goils"" Peter rants for 3 minutes about how he isn't gay. With the other songs, it seems like way too many inside jokes or self-indulged humor is being presented. Oct. Rust was a true reflection of a struggle within, World Coming Down was a continuation of that struggle and LIKM just takes too much of a comical twist. Maybe I just prefer to older, darker, and more gothic TON (Oct. Rust) if you liked WCD the best, then check this album out. It definately has its moments, there are just (in my opinion) too many skippable and overlookable tracks and moments on this album."
4,lots of tongue-in-cheek goth metal energy,"This album brings together many of T.O.N.'s best qualities:* Lyrics that don't (can't!) take themselves too seriously, but still manage to inspire the firing of a neuron or two. There are a few surprises in there as well.* Fantastic recording engineering - the record, like most of theirs, sounds absolutely incredible. (For any album from ""Bloody Kisses"" on, get a good pair of headphones and a double dose of your poison of choice, turn it up, and enjoy the craftsmanship put into the recording and mixing of a T.O.N. CD.)* Strong, tight musicianship. No one's trying to show off, and everyone is pulling their weight. The result is balanced, layered, and quite enjoyable.Although I've really enjoyed epic nature of the prior, more thematic albums, this CD is nice because it's not quite as dark or heavy, while remaining firmly within the genre they've created for themselves.4 stars for a very solid effort. (5 is reserved for ground-breaking material.)"
3,What a lucky girl!,"To have a choice between three devoted and good - looking admirers is a reality that Anna knows. From ruggedly handsome long-time boyfriend Joel, sophisticated and insincere Peter, to muscular, flirty Kerry, Anna has the kind of love problems that most girls want. Her silly and embarassing antics leave the reader cringing as she begins to discover which man she really cares about"
1,did not last the life of the batteries,"I bought two for exterior doors so I could garden and lock the house without having to carry keys. I live in Iowa, which has all weather ranges and they keyless entry worked very well for awhile but then quit working so I thought the batteries had died but replacement batteries did not help so now I'm stuck with a broken electronic lock and am back to using the keys as a basic, but very expensive, deadbolt. My mother also bought one and had to have it replaced within a year. Great idea, poor longevity."
4,Better,"I ordered Kwikset 909CNT 15 SMT CP SmartCode Single Cylinder Contemporary Deadbolt, Satin Nickel and it was awful. I spent two hours fighting bad hardware and finally returned it. This set went on with very little effort. The only hardware issue was the two large attachment screws needed to be oiled and pre turned before actual installation. The unit functions okay. It could be smoother, but it does the job and the programming was easy."
1,lasted about a year,Lasted about a year for me. I did not even use it much since I installed it in an exterior side door leading out from the garage. The unit would keep beeping and then eventuall failed. I bought the first unit through visa so I am glad that I got Extended warranty through Visa!
1,Waste of Money!,"Worked for about 3 months. It woke me up in the middle of the month cycling through all the numbers making beeps. I thought someone was trying to break in my house. The only way to stop it was to remove a battery. Next morning, I put in brand new batteries. Didn't fix it. We had to use a key for about 2 weeks. I thought I would try it again and it worked well for another 2 weeks but beeped like crazy again. It's out of warranty because we didn't install it as soon as we purchased it so the company can't do much for me. I've read other reviews on the internet and one other person had this problem too. They reported that the company told them this random cycling through the numbers and beeping wasn't possible."
4,Great toy even from a physics standpoint,"The toy is a practical example of a solar system in motion. Creating a mechanical solar system with an actual scaled speed showing the planets motion (as the apalled physics teacher stated) would simply be impractical as Pluto would appear motionless while Mercury whirl furiously around the sun. Presenting a drillpress-like danger to children. That level of realism is more appropriate in educational software. Secondly even if it were to accurately depict the proper speed of the planets orbits it would still ""appal"" physics teachers since all the model planets would still trace unrealistic circular orbits and distance scales could never be accurately shown. In its present form this model is an exciting demonstration of the solar system and an excellent decoration for any childs room."
1,Not good at all.,"Despite the lack or reviews, I was hoping this book would be a diamond in the rough, but it wasn't. The book has a low-quality feel to it, and its content has been covered by hundreds of better books. It's also not very readable; the style seems like a psudo-science textbook than a read-for-pleasure paperback."
2,Watch it carefully,"All American 921 21-1/2-Quart Pressure Cooker/CannerWe purchased this pressure canner 14 months ago based on the many recommendations. It is very difficult to get a good seal. You have to watch it constantly. We didn't and it leaked out all of the steam. The heat then caused the bottom to burn out. If you want to be very careful to make sure it does burn out all of the water, it should do a good job. For those of us not that careful, a pressure canner with a gasket is much easier."
5,"All American, All Awesome","I am using this pressure cooker specifically to can fresh albacore. I can't say anything about experience with the product over time because I've only used it once. But I can say it's built tough, it's very easy to use, and produced the best end result yet for me. I have recommended this to friends and family."
4,Great system,"I've been using a pressure canner for years now. Used one when I thought the Y2K issue was serious, canned up scads and scads of meat. This is a canner you want for meats. Otherwise, when it comes to vegetables, use the usual water system. I think everyone should use this system as it does everything, meat, everything!!!"
4,confusing instruction manual,I was considering packing it back and returning after reading the attached manual. It states that no hard beans should be cooked in this pressure cooker. That was my reason for buying it. After some investigations I found that adding 1/4 cup of canola or other oil takes care of the foaming issue. It did the trick. It performed very well. I left beans in it for 3 or 4 hours to let them cool off. They were softest ever.Otherwise the device is very solidly built. It should manage many loads of beans and generate lasting pressure.
4,Good craftmanship!,"This pressure canner is of very high quality. The first time I opened the box and took it out, I can see the big difference with the one I currently have. I am so happy that I don't have to be concerned with the gasket anymore. Furthermore, the display gauge gives you an idea as to how long it will be before it will jiggle and for you to lower down the heat. The only thing that you'll have to be aware of is that you have to ensure that the cover is attached properly to the bottom with the wingnuts. I was successful with my first try but the second time I used it, I was a bit more careless. There was so much steam coming out that it did not reach the correct pressure so I had to stop the canning in order to avoid drying out."
4,Sturdy Canner,Very heavy duty as advertised. All parts are quality! Feel very secure in using this over some of the lighter models I looked at in the store. Hope to use it for many years to come.
5,At first E wasn't sure,"The first couple of times I used it tree was steam leaking. But I called and they said that was normal, as it appears to be. It doesn't leak at at now. This is a heavy duty unit, that's made in USA,you can have pride and confidence owning it."
5,Well worth the price,Incredibly heavy duty- definite commercial quality and grade. Don't even think about getting one of those cheesy low end cheap pressure cookers (like Presto).The All American is the top shelf pressure cooker.
2,Thomas Whistle,Very disappointed in this product. It's too big for a whistle and when you blow into it you can hardly hear it. Bought it for my grandson and he hates it.
2,Can't get a sound.,The kids couldn't get a sound out of it and even I had difficult time making it work. Perhaps I need to take some lessons.
1,Worst book I've read in years!,"Terrible book! I love a good memoir more than anything (The Glass Castle, for an example of an excellent memoir), but usually have one of two complaints. For the most part, memoirs today are either well-written books about nothing, or poorly-written books about something unusual and fascinating. Kimmel achieves what I thought was impossible and writes without style or order about nothing!The subtitle doesn't make any sense either: ""growing up small""?? That's different from ""growing up in a small town"".Just a few pages in, I was sure that the book I was holding was completely different from the book that received all of the positive reviews, but I was wrong. For some reason, Kimmel has found a way to trick readers, and I just don't get it."
4,"Fun, quirky characters","I enjoyed ZIPPY. There are some reviewers who think it's not an honest memoir, but so what?There were moments of verisimilitude that were so dead-on, like Zippy's marvelling over Dana's ability to not only do the dishes but wipe down the counters, even behind the cannisters. Another instance is how the father snaps the butt of his cigarette away. I've seen my father do that. I love the conversations between Zippy and her father.My favorite characters were the parents. The father had an interesting sort of charm, both in Haven's story and in the accompanying photographs. The mother was my kind of gal, nestled into the couch reading endlessly.Like other reviewers, I'd love to know what happened in the gap after ZIPPY ended and I found the article about her in ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY last month. I noticed in reading the acknowledgments that her mother has a different last name. Did her father die and her mother remarry, or did they divorce?"
3,A pleasant journey through childhood.,"A Girl Named Zippy is a pleasant journey through childhood in simpler times in Middle America before the introduction of video games, cell phones, compact disks, and personal computers (and all that they stand for); even that good old stand-by, the TV, didn't feature very prominently in Zippy's life. In these pages, you'll find the world from the viewpoint of a child, complete with eccentric grown-ups, childhood antics, pets, and the occasional creepy neighborhood kid (I could relate to that!). There were pleny of slow spots, particularly when the details of some events were a bit too drawn-out, leaving me with the feeling that the book was just a bit overdone. Still, nothing dramatic or shocking will be found here, nor the solution of world problems, just life-as-it-once-was for Haven ""Zippy"" Kimmel. A good light read, and for that reason, A Girl Named Zippy is decent entertainment."
3,Am I missing something? I didn't see much humor here...,"My aunt and mother asked me to read this to see what I thought. It was billed as a thoughtful, hilarious memoir of a girl growing up in a small mid-western town. Sounded good to me. However, what I found were a few chuckles, some very good writing, but mostly I was taken with the sadness of her story. Her father gambled away her mother's wedding rings. Her mother was depressed and spent all her time reading sci-fi and convincing her she was adopted (cruel). Her neighbors were creeps that threatened to kill her pets. Her friend and her mother had to flee in the middle of the night from an abusive husband and father. Graphic detail of animals being killed, butchered, dying and rotting under houses, etc. All I know is that if this is what people are describing as a funny, heartwarming childhood memoir, I'm sorry for us all. It was nicely written and I'd love to see her try again, but this just wasn't my cup of tea."
3,Small town corn,"I enjoyed the sense of growing up in the 60's this book portrayed. I felt I could identify with the character and enjoyed the book very much. So much so that I went to the library and got Kimmel's book the Solace of Leaving Early. (I think that's the title, sorry if I got it wrong) I never even finished reading it. I couldn't identify with any of the characters and I felt it moved way to slow. Oh well."
4,Refreshing & Wonderful,"I actually listened to the audio book read by the author. She does a great job as a reader which usually isn't the case when an author reads her own work, in my experience.It's great to read about someone's lovely and loving childhood for a change, and it's not boring! Far from it. I laughed out loud, and cried from being moved by beauty instead of tragedy. Don't miss this one."
3,Memories!,"This is a memoir about a girl who was born in 1965 and grew up in a small Indiana town. At first I was thinking I would have little interest in or find anything I would relate to in her story. I was wrong. Haven Kimmel did a great job of telling her story in a way that was interesting and funny. I found myself relating to many aspects of the story. Being about the same age as Zippy helped me relate to the era she grew up in, but the story is about more than being born in the 60's, growing up in a small town or being a girl, it's about being a kid and being a kid is something we can all relate to.As I was reading ""A Girl Named Zippy"" I found myself having fond memories of my own childhood and moments spent with my parents. What more could one ask for?"
5,Beautiful and True,"I judged a book by its cover - and was not disappointed. The cover shot was so striking that I snatched it up, flipped through the first chapter, quickly got addicted and had to finish it that night. I sat on the couch all evening with my loved one and to his raised eyebrows, just laughed and laughed. Haven Kimmel has this fantastic ability to draw you into a Mooreland of the 1960's-70's, to show you her life as a gawky, searching herione like no other. And though it's very specific,the concepts, her memories, actions, etc... are so universal - dissecting the science of best friends, over-compassion for animals, all-consuming belief and fear. Read it! So Ms. Kimmel can create a sequel, and I can stop wondering how dearest Zippy gets through jr. high! ;)"
1,Did not work for me,It was the first time I bought a pair of safety glasses. I picked it up from Home Depot and it was actually cheaper there.The fit was a little loose for my small head.The biggest negative was that the vision was distorted and it gave me a bad headache in 10 minutes. I used it once and returned it to the store.
4,very comfortable but...,"I just received these in the mail. They are the most comfortable shoes I have ever put on..however, they look a little different than pictured. They don't have the rubber sole that is shown. Instead they dont have any sole. I wanted to wear them out, however, I probably shouldn't because water or dirt will seep in through the bottoms. That is the only negative thing. Overall they are very comfortable and look cute. I wouldn't buy these though if you are thinking about wearing these outdoors often. They are more for indoors."
1,This book is very misleading!,"""A Medieval Feast"" is a children's book on a feast held during the Middle Ages. Since I was looking for a book on Medieval Cookery, and this title came up, I purchased it. I shouldn't have. It's a picture book for young children, and it has nothing whatsoever to do with Medieval recipes or cookery. If It wouldn't cost me the price of the book in shipping, I'd send it back. However, for children who would like a story with a Medieval flare, this book is perfect for them, with lovely illustrations by ALIKI."
4,Finally!,"Rogues' Reform is a collection of three of Ms Laurent's earlier works. These older novels are so hard to find, and I've never read one of the titles in this trilogy. The novels, The Reasons for Marriage, A Lady of Expectations, and An Unwilling Conquest, tell the stories of the Lester family. Written with Ms Laurens' usual humor in a Regency setting, the adventures of Lenore, Jack and Harry are hard to put down. A definite bargain at the price! Just the thing to whet your appetite until the release of #5 (A Secret Love) in the Bar Cynster series in July. Happy Reading!"
1,No wedding?,"The book that a 6 year old read to me, had much more detail, including a wedding story with what both families thought of the other. This is a very disappointing version."
3,"Reasonably OK, but not enough for 90%+ scores","This book is all right--unmarred by the egregious errors and typos that characterize most of the GRE Bio test preparation texts currently on the market. However, it's insufficient if you're trying to achieve really high scores. For that, I recommend the book put out by ETS (Amazon sells it). I found that to be the only practice test that strongly resembled the actual test.As background, I took the GRE Biology Subject Exam in December 1999, and scored in the upper 97% (if that makes any difference.) I personally found the ETS practice tests the most useful study aid, in conjunction with textbooks Campbell's Biology and Molecular Biology of the Cell by Alberts, et al. This book was a distant fourth, but those whose Bio is quite rusty, or whose scoring goals are more modest, might be quite pleased with it. (The other review books I used--the Barron's book and the one by Ogden--were a waste of time and money.)"
1,Never received correct item,"I never received eb5 emulsion instead I received the free portion of my order ""eb5vibrant eyes"", I contacted amazon they re-sumbitted the order and AGAIN I only received the free portion of my order, my advise is not to order this duo if you really want the eb5 emulsion spf 15"
4,Simple and practical,"I think this book is very good because es simple, explain clearly and go directly to the matter.Juan Ramon Divison"
3,undecided--funky strap!,"like the purse and design. like how it lays and comfort. BUT the ""cotton strap"" is seatbelt strapping. seems out of place or an afterthought to a leather purse...looks like pretty decent leather for the price, too. sitting on the table waiting to be returned or pay to replace handle..."
5,Read it,"If you like travel memoirs, have an interest in west africa, culture, the peace corp or the life of some of the poorer people's of the world (monetarily) than read it. If you've been to Mali, this is one you don't want to miss. If you haven't, this will make you want to go. One of the best books I've ever read."
2,Most violent? Surely not?,"Well, maybe this is the most violent Eurowestern ever made, but that's relative. All the violence is very much IMPLICIT rather than explicit and it all looks a bit tame to modern eyes. During the 'rape' scene, for example, it's all about focussing on the faces rather than the event, which means that 'Chato's Land', as a very basic comparison off the top of my head, is far more raw, brutal, violent, believable and enjoyable.And obviously there's more to a film than simple violence. This movie is just downright grim, from the characters to the stark landscape.With no redeeming qualities, this film is extremely disappointing. Unless you really have to watch every Eurowestern ever made, avoid this one and look for something a bit more special and not as overrated."
2,It's not just about Mardi Gras,"I was expecting a good novel about Mardi Gras. It took about half the book before the parades even started. It's an interesting story, but if you're expecting the plot to be centered around Carnival in New Orleans exclusively you might be disappointed. The book was hard to read because the editing was really bad. Being a Louisiana native, I noticed several misspellings of New Orleans' places and in more than a few instances sentences just don't make sense. That was the biggest disappointment - that a book would get out with these kinds of mistakes."
4,Interesting Collection of Himmler Photos,"As a Historian, I am proud to count this item amongst my collection. A full chronicle of Heinrich Himmler's life - mostly career - through the power of photos. The book in itself is very good and makes for good and interesting reading. I give it only 4 stars though because it is not as well put together as it could have been. It's not so much a question of content, as it is very complete. Quality wise however, many of the photos presented by Mansson leave a lot to be desired. Many of them are new to me but the quality of a lot of them is quite poor, and for some, almost blurry. Thankfully the uniqueness of the compilation is enough to allow me to overlook this small, yet important, downside."
2,Underwhelming,"It's incredibly noisy on hardwood floors, and it's not really powerful enough for an interesting game of chase. Also, it gets stuck in corners. The cats seem (very) mildly curious about it. I sometimes put it in a paper bag with a few other things; that gets the cats interested ... for a while."
4,good movie,"i relate alot to this movie, i liked freddie highmore role alot because he didnt know what to do with himself and his unrequitted feelings for emma roberts, i really related to him"
2,2 for ease of use,"I bought this stroller for our three year old daughter yesterday and will be taking it back tomorrow morning. It took my husband and I to snap the pieces together and a lot or re-snapping to get them to stay in place. Once we got it together, our daughter could not switch it to any other position...nor could I. The pieces kept snapping out and the plastic pieces that hold the frame together are already showing signs of stress. While pushing the stroller through the house, the front tray simply fell off. We were quite upset with the wheels also. The wheels are simply hard plastic and do not turn well. I was disappointed that I had to take this toy away from our daughter, she was so excited to get it. Spend a bit more and buy the graco car seat stroller combo, much higher quality."
1,Liberal-schmiberal,"This brand of crazy is as short sighted as the rest of politics today. A more correct title would be ""How To Ensure Americans Will Continue to Chase False Gods and Vote for a Government That Is Only Successfull at NOT Getting Anything Done"". If you want to have lip-service paid to your ideals, read this book. If you really want to live in a better world, start reading Ayn Rand and Milton Friedman."
5,well worth the price,I saved over $400 on two airline tickets to Europe this summer by contacting a source cited in this book.
1,Not good. Really.,"Ive been doing construction work and repairs for 10 years or so. Ive done a lot of caulking over years. A lot.Followed the instructions to the letter. Terrible it just washes right off the seam after 48 hours of drying. It goes on too liquidy as well. Im fairly certain they missed a solvent in the factory for curing. Dap has not always done thtis, however their products have often been mixed for me.Fortunately i caut his now. Use only silocone branded products. This is worthless. Not even good for cracks."
1,Worst Product,"After following directions, the first exposure to water and the product softened and oozed from where it was applied. Even though the label says Kitchen and Bath, it does not mean that water can come near it without complete failure"
3,Uneven Legal Thriller,"Daniel Ames, an associate at a large law firm seems too overjoyed with his good fortune. When he gets talked into reviewing thousands of documents for an upcoming case, things start to go haywire. This is only the second Margolin book that I have read, Wild Justice being the first, however, Wild Justice was by far a better read. Daniel is about as naive a lawyer as I have ever seen and represents a weak main character. The suspense is weak and the plot jumped around so,that I frequently had to go back several pages just to figure out who's who and how they fit into the story. While I did manage to finish the book, this was not the best legal read."
2,The cover is the best part,"The intertwined stories were so complicated and convoluted that the main characters had to review the actors (whose names and locations frequently changed) and explain the plots in the last chapter of the book. None of the characters were well-developed or their motivation clear except for the lead, Daniel Ames, ""the associate"", who lost his job, got arrested frequently, and shot up by assorted villains. One poor snook arranged to meet Daniel at night in a graveyard in the rain only to be shot in the head and have his brains and blood spill on poor Daniel, who is very hard on clothing in this novel. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
4,Great photos from the LAPD archives,"I saw a story about the authors on a local PBS show in Los Angeles, they are preserving the LAPD photo archives and have picked some of their favorites for this book. It's a bit gruesome in parts (of course, they are crime scene photos!) but it is an interesting glance into L.A.'s past, and I'm glad these folks are doing what they can to preserve our heritage. The photo presentation is great - this is a nice, large format book that gives you good sized images. Recommended for fans of photo and/or the macabre."
5,"Dolphins, A Message of Love",Beautiful music for relaxing or to fall asleep to. I just love it! Will buy more music from Federic Delarue soon.
5,"Beautiful, meditative, romantic",This is the third copy of this I've purchased - one for me and two for gifts to be given to friends having a difficult time. Obviously I really like it! I first discovered this when I met Mr. Delarue in Palm Springs.
2,Avoid this turkey!,"The plot is intriguing - Is the illusion the apparent deaths on-stage or the temporary continued zombie-like ""life"" of the murdered?But the acting is absolutely terrible! The actors sound as if they are reading their lines for the first time. I kept watching thinking it had to get better - It didn't!By today's standards the ""gore"" is relatively tame - For its time it might have been daring. But this movie did not age well at all. And the degree of gore seems simply there as its own element - not really so relevant to the plot.Avoid this turkey!"
1,Junk junk and junk,Im a amatuer dj and all i needed was something to preview the next song on mixmeister. I followed the instructions on how to install did not worked on window xp or window vista and just to make sure i installed it on my other vista computer (i have 3 laptops). after installing all i heard was what i would say cliking sound. i tried changig the lag time but it did not work. i went the numark website downloaded newer driver version and walla it it work one time at a gig. as i was getting ready for the nex gig 2 weeks later it did not work again. finnaly i went to fry's and got a external usb that worked 100 times better. Save your money. Thanks for reading.
1,It doesnt work with virtual dj or traktor pro,"My computer just crashes after 30 min that I been using it with dj io along with virtual dj or traktor pro.I have a new macbook 10.5It just freezes my computer and you have to restart it. (Thats not so pro in the middle of a gig.)So I called the people from Numark who by the way were very rude, and they just told me that in order to make it work I would have to get the new version from virtual dj and that means spending more money! So I'm just guessing that in order to be able to keep using their products you have to pay each time they come up with something new!!!Very disapointing!!!!"
3,No linux support,No linux support whatsoever. If you google Dj io and linux support you will see in one of their forums that their reply to someone asking about linux is to say that it is up to the customer to get their product running. Some of their competitors aren't good about this either. That same google search shows that someone has gotten this to work with virtualbox running windows XP SP 3 (there's a link to it in one of the ubuntu forums). Has an optional plug for a 6 volt/1 amp power supply next to the usb on the back (description currently says 9 volt).I do like the way that they describe in detail each port coming in and out of the device.
5,Great Audio Interface!,"I was researching about a good audio interface for my laptop since I'll DJ in small/medium parties. and I'm glad I picked the Numark DJ I/O. is a good quality device and easy to setup with VDJ pro software. All I have to do was to install the CD software for the drivers (Win XP Pro),plug it via usb to my laptop, configure VDJ software, plug it to my speakers and voila! great sound and good performance. Excellent product!"
3,Wacky book.,"This was a very good book, but I really didn't like where it went. It really left a lot of questions unanswered"
3,Ventilated Seat Cushion,It works. Like all of these products . . they move around. But I knew what I would be getting and I got it. IT WORKS.
1,Cheap Product!,Bought two. Both fell apart after about two weeks of use. Total waste of money. Do not buy. Will not buy again.
4,"HOLLYWOOD MEETS THE MILITARY SNIPER,, PART 2","I FOUND THIS MOVIE TO BE A LITTLE BETTER THAN THE FIRST SNIPER MOVIE. ONCE AGAIN TOM BERENGER IS RIGHT ON AS GUNNERY SGT BECKETT, MARINE SNIPER. THERE WERE NICE LITTLE REFINEMENTS OVER THE FIRST MOVIE WITH MORE BELIEVEABLE SCOPE CROSSHAIRS, AND EVEN SOME TECHNICAL TALK ABOUT SNIPER CRAFT. I ALSO LIKED THE FACT THAT THIS MOVIE ACKNOWLEDGED THE ARMY SNIPER CORPS. THE FINAL SNIPER VS SNIPER DUEL WAS VERY ENJOYABLE AND RIVALED ENEMY AT THE GATES DUEL IN MY BOOK. ALL IN ALL A VERY ENJOYABLE LITTLE MOVIE. AS A RETIRED ARMY SNIPER, MY HAT IS TIPPED TO TOM BERENGER FOR BRINGING THE MILITARY SNIPER CORPS TO THE SILVER SCREEN."
4,"Another On Shot, One Kill","Sniper 2 DVDThe first ""Sniper"" movie was a good film -- more of a character study than an action story. This sequel took on some of that same flavor as well, though there was sufficient action in the movie to keep it from being boring.Tom Berenger reprises the original character (Becker) well. Somewhat anti-social grumpy but with deep feelings, Becker is an interesting and complex character. In this sequel, Becker is older, wider around the middle, but he still is a fabulous marksman (despite an injury that put him out of the sniper business after the first film). And so after years of retirement, he's called into service once again, on a foolhardy and convoluted mission.Recommended for Tom Berenger fans.Gunner December 2007"
1,not nearly as good as the first movie,"Dumb plot,unrealistic, al least the first movie had some small chance of really happening. Tom is the only good thing about the movie."
1,What language are they speaking?,"I am a Bosnian,Croatian,and Serbian linguist, as is my wife. We watched this movie and were trying to figure out which Eastern European country they were in. We were suprised to learn that it is supposedly taking place in the Balkans. Well, it isn't Bosnia, because we didnt understand a damn word. If you are going to film a country in the Balkans, try using Bosnian, Serbian, or Croatian; especially if you are referring to Bosnia.Total waste of time.....Would not recommend this movie."
3,Dissapointing Centurion,"The first 10 tracks on this album are not the original recordings. The ""new"" recordings are not as good as the original ones. Lobo fans will know the difference immediately. The balance of the tracks are mostly not Lobo's own work. Faithful is probably the most pleasing track on this album. If you are a Wolf (spanish for Lobo) fan, rather get the original LPs which are now available on CD. JR Centurion"
4,The cool book,The book was great!!! The best part was when Travis got found. It feels like you are actally in the book when you read it. It is a great book if you like aventurs.
4,Great Book!!!!!!!!,I thought the book was really good....and interesring. I like books with alot of adventure in them and I cant wait to read the next book!!!!!
2,"Very easy to use, but interference bars ruin picture","Very easy to set up, but no matter what I did, I got several horizontal interference bars. One very nice feature is a built in video modulator that allows you to connect to older TVs using a coax cable instead of RCA. I am returning this product."
1,Poor quality sender,"It is very easy to install the sender, but the picture quality is really low. Most of time you get the interference from other wireless objects like mobile phone, 900MHZ cordless phones, etc. Will not recommend to buy for the once who are looking for good quality picture and sound transfer."
5,works,"used this on canvas top, did the job, also drenched my wind jacket with it and it was water proof again"
3,Worked ok,Worked ok but the 303 stuff lasted longer. For some reason this let through drips in heavry rain. I covered it real well and let it dry but 2 weeks later had a down pour and it leaked. But worked fine for just regular rain.
