1,Hard to use,"Unlike the picture shows.1. There is no short little cord included. It blocks both receptacles of a standard outlet.2. The display is difficult to read because it is dim (no backlight) and the display fonts are super tiny. You'll need a flashlight and magnifying glass.3. When plugged in, the device defaults to $, not watts. You have to play with the menu buttons to get there.A local hardware store had an easier to use unit for $20."
1,Did not meet my expectation,Does not show watt consumed instantly. It is basically for calculating monthly or yearly cost calculation which takes very long time. At first I thought it doesn't even work but after observing for long hours I saw some value but again I needed a devise that shows me how much any electronic device consumes electricity as soon as I plug-in.
5,Nifty Little Device,"I got this, in part, because my father in law said that his meter said the CFL lights weren't actually pulling the wattage they claimed. I searched online and read it had to do with the way the meter read the load, and the guy recommended this one. So I got it. My CFLs pull what they say they pull, as does my AC unit. So I'm happy with it. I have it happily racking up the costs of my big AC unit right now.It's pretty easy to operate; at least, I just fumbled around until I found the measures I was interested in. I'm going to have to read how to adjust the cost/kWhr, but other than that, it's good."
5,Why didn't I buy this sooner?,This unit is really easy to use and with the calculations it performs you just plug it in and leave it. For most products you only need to have this plugged in for 24 hours to get a good average. Other things like tvs that get more usage on the weekends needs to be plugged in for about a week. I didn't find the screen hard to read but a 3' outlet strip works well for easy access.
4,Pretty but too large.,"I ordered these for a gift and they are quite pretty. The stones have a nice sparkle to them and they don't look cheap. Although, I think, the whole earring is a bit too large. Also, the pearls are not quite the same size and shape and are not totally round. If that does not bother you then you will like these."
2,Atrocious Remastering,"These late-20s recordings by Helen Kane were extremely well recorded (by Victor) for their time. How horrible that Robert Parker should turn back the clock to the ghastly ""fake stereo"" era of the early 60s. Fake echo has also been added to the muddy, over-equalized tracks to the point where they are barely listenable. Two stars for the content alone."
3,"Some questionable technical choices, enjoyable execution, fails to deliver","Ok, it's a piano concert. Does it mean that the piano has to sound louder than the orchestra? Hardly. Lang Lang is undoubtedly technically gifted, the first movement is quite enjoyable and so is the second. Then, in the third movement, we land nowhere. I am no music expert, I just enjoy to listen; this last part, played, for instance, by Ashkenazy, always gives me a sense of existential relief; something that young Lang Lang fails, in my opinion, to deliver. This is too bad, because the concert is well played; maybe try again in 10 or 15 years?"
2,Lang Lang,"If you are a connoisseur/afcionado of classical piano works and have listened to a few good deliveries, this does not measure up. The technique is not ripe and delivery misses the nuances of the actual compositions. It is not clear. It is not important what you do; it is more important how you do it. If you do not improve the composition at least do not bring it down. I still give this product a passing grade. For comparative purposes buy it. And you the mushy nationalists, stop undeserved flattery because you'll bring down the standard of good performance in art."
2,Awful.,"Personally, I think 'Our Lips Are Sealed' is awful. It is frankly comical how Hilary tries to measure up to her sister, who is actually talented. Hilary sounds like she has just inhaled helium and not even gone through puberty yet compared to Haylie. It defames an old song, and I bought it, and was dissapointed."
5,Timeless love tales,"Meet Layla. Meet Majnun. Two souls from different caste of life, one rich & the other otherwise. Layla and Majnun has been in love with each other ever since they were children. But due to their caste, their love has been forbiddened by Layla's parents. They have tried everything to keep them both apart, even by moving away to live in another city. Majnun, broken hearted, traveled in his rags to look for her until one day, he did but he has a competitor, a rich businessman much to Layla's father a far suited match for Layla.This is an age old story of love, much like Romeo & Juliet in genre but in a far more trouble in between. I would recommend reading of this literature at least once in your life."
4,In fifty words or less....,"Highly entertaining. So why not five stars? Well, some rely on British expressions that are not known to us Americans. And there was a bit too much repetition - lots of people jumping off of cliffs. But there were also lots of laughs. ""A Railway Junction"" was lovely and poetic."
4,deliciously enchanting,"This delightful blend of fact and fiction introduces us to a young immortal Spaniard, Diego de Godoy, whose fanciful adventures span four centuries. We travel through history as Diego discovers love, life, and chocolate. Not only was the novel cleverly conceived but it was also amusing, sensual, and descriptive. My family and I read it aloud on a long road trip and found it so deliciously enchanting that we also had to stop twice to savor that divine confection!"
5,Dog car seat,"We bought this car seat because we were taking our Pomeranian on a 5 hour drive to DC. She had been carsick on short drives before we bought the carseat and was not totally comfortable in the car. We had bought a carseat from our local Petco but it was not meant for a bench seat so we returned it. This car seat worked perfectly in our back seat. It comes with a strap to attach to the seatbelt and to her harness so she remained secure in the car seat. She was very comfortable in the car seat, was fine for the drive and was not car sick. It was definitely worth the money."
5,My little poodle loved this the first time she rode in it.,My dog is a toy poodle and could not see out as she was so short....now she is up looking almost all the time. It is made super good and prevent her falling off seat in quick stop. Only complaint is for her I should ordered a small one. She loves it and so do I
4,Safe and sturdy,"Nicely manufactured - it stands up to my dog's digging activity while we are driving. Even though it's the medium, it still fits on only 1 seat in our backseat and doesn't crowd the middle seat. My only complaint is that the slits for the seat belt to go through are quite large, when my dog (only 15 pounds) leans against the side wall, he bends kind of far down because there isn't support around the slit."
2,Pet Seat,Overall I was not happy with the seat. Even though the puppy was very comfortable in it--the adjust-ability and sliding belts were very undesirable. You should not have to search for a large safety pin so the belt doesn't slide back and forth.
5,My dog loves loves loves his Snoozer!,Great product and great quality. My dog leans on the side of it to look out the window when riding around and it holds up like up champ. I thought it would at least start to buckle a little but no. I think he prefers his snoozer over our laps now. When we get another dog I'll definitely be getting another one.
5,MY FANTABULOUS LOOKOUT,I already have the large lookout for my babies (3 Chihuahuas) and it is big enough for them but at times 2 of them are really rambunctious and trample over my timid one. I got the small one for her so she can be comfortable. We take our babies everywhere and knowing that they are safely secured in their lookouts makes it an awesome outing where ever we go. I recommend these to EVERYONE. This seller was awesome. It was supposed to be delivered between the 11th-16th of July and it came on the 10th!! Dont be afraid of this product or seller they are both awesome!!!
4,Comfy and safe seat for my little doxie,"I like it because the outer shell comes off for washing. It is easy to attach to the seat belt. Also, as my puppy grows, the harness strap is adjustable for her new heights (although she is a doxie and won't get much taller)."
3,Not very secure,"Maybe my expectations were too high, but based on the reviews I thought it would strap in securely and have some kind of harness attachment mechanism (even just a loop would have worked) but it did neither.The only way it is secured in place is with the seat belt crossing one corner of the back part. All it takes is a sudden stop at 25 mph to tilt and cause my dog to fall off the seat. It works fine as a regular booster seat, but provides no safety for my 12 lbs. min pin mix. Plus he doesn't even like sitting in it, and hops out and climbs into my lap as soon as we start moving (whether it's in the front or back seat).So now it's just taking up room in the back seat of my car, until we've got enough room for it in the can on trash day. It's too bad, because I really need a safe, secure car seat for my dog.Why two stars? Because it seems well constructed (though poorly designed) so I would have felt bad about giving them less."
4,Perfect for small cars and dogs,Got this for a 5 lb dog and a Lexus IS 250 convertible (bucket seats). Fit perfectly and would probably work for up to a 14lb dog. Way better price than in any pet store I found. (by $20 bucks)
5,Snoozer Lookout Pet Car Seat,Love it. The dog loves to sleep in it anytime. It seems safe for the car. She can look out the window and now no longer gets car sick.
5,Very Important for Beginners,"I agree with the others reviewers that most of the information is is a checklist of don't forgets and filled with information that is ""common: sense, but I still think that it is a very valuable book.I am a film student and I have worked on an indy feature film and a commercial and I believe that both of those projects could have gone much better had the producers/directors had this information.This book is perfect for the person who has no knowledge of film, but needs an overview of the process in order to get teir feet wet. The book also contains all the necessary forms for each phase of making a film."
4,Something else...,"...that's for sure! You really have to be in a certain mood to watch this ""peculiar"" movie. Sting as the Devil himself, well as a big fan I must say that the man never stops to surprise me. I really liked him in The Grotesque (with Alan Bates) as well. He always acts to be very different from the sophisticated music-performer he is and is most famous for -so it is kind of funny to see him in these kind of ""crazy"" roles. Yes, the acting in ""Brimstone..."" is very good indeed -the story, well, different. Original, and sometimes funny -other times it just makes you sick. All I can say is; looking for an alternate movie-experience with a different ""twist"" then this might be what you're looking for..? I've seen it twice, and I don't regret it!"
1,Lutheran Book of Prayer,This book was printed with a fine light font. I couldn't read it. Concoria should consider it's readers and use a heavier darker font. I gave the book away rather than sending it back
1,Its just merely OK,"The previous additions of the Lutheran Prayer Book are superior to this one (1970 & 1951).This one seems less of glorifying God, than shameless butt kissing. It comes off as insincere and WAAAY over the top syrupy. When I pray, I keep it genuine and personal. Many of the prayers in this edition are too verbose and borderline silly. If anyone spoke to me in the tone the authors use, I'd have to laugh and roll my eyes.One other thing that disturbed me about this book is that many of the prayers seem to mirror the hijacking of Christianity by the republican evangelical right. It mixes secular politics and earthly hot button topics with the true word. I found it VERY offensive. Particularly the prayers about govt and the armed forces. I prefer my worship to be partisan free and that is EXTREMELY difficult to find these days."
2,Too loose on the ears,Earphones don't stay on ears. For $50 bucks I was hoping that they would be more secure on the head.
4,An Early Solo Classic from Jerry Lewis,"Long before ""Mr. Mom"" or ""Kramer vs. Kramer"", Jerry Lewis made a great argument for fathers to have as much say in the raising and nurturing of their children as mothers. This delightful comedy (with just enough drama added in for good measure) is about a man who goes beyond expectation to care for three baby girls who are left at his doorstep.Moreover, this is not merely a comedy, but a musical, with songs that deserve the right to be as well remembered as any from ""The Wizard of Oz"" or ""The Sound of Music"".This, among other Jerry Lewis classics, should be issued on DVD, but until they are VHS still looks pretty good."
1,POOR QUALITY!!,I received this as a gift from my husband for Christmas. I thought it was a wonderful gift until I started using it. It is a piece of garbage. It drains the batteries like crazy. You can't even get through an entire CD before the batteries are dead. The radio reception is terrible. I can't even get one station to come in half way decent. I've sent the unit back to the manufacturer once already. They replaced the unit and I haven't tried the new one yet. But after reading the rest of the reviews I'm not too optimistic. I have a feeling I will be returning it for a refund shortly.
4,I must have been lucky!,"I received the MC1008 for Christmas last year (2002) and must have been extremely lucky because mine still works! In fact, I was searching Amazon to buy one as a gift for someone this year. It's true that the thing eats up batteries like crazy when playing a CD, but I almost exclusively use it for the radio function. With just playing the radio and only using it when showering, the batteries last about 4 months.As I said, it's approaching a year old and all of the functions still work fine.As for the person who claimed that the manual said not to use it near water, that line was taken out of context. The manual says if you use a plug-in adapter don't use it near water. I'm guessing this is a safety precaution, not a wear-and-tear issue."
1,"POOR DESIGN, POOR QUALITY","Tinny sound is only the first of many problems. It uses batteries at an incredable rate (a AC adapter is not included, so even though I was using it on a counter, not in the shower, I still had to feed it batteries.) I could only tune in one radio station clearly, even with an antenna attached; the control buttons are poorly laid out, and make no intuitive sense. It is dificult to tell at a glance if the unit is turned off, so it is easy to leave it left on by mistake, further draining the batteries. The CD player skipped and would stop in the middle of a song for no apparent reason. This is obviously a product that was rushed to market with little or no testing."
5,Seems to work,Helps my headaches somewhat. so it's worth it for me. it's only been a few days though. hopefully it stays this way.
5,Delicious!,"I don't know why my grocery store quit carrying this mustard - they carry several other Beaver Brand Mustards, just not the Deli Mustard. After asking for 2 different stores to order/carry it for me, and waiting while they attempted to order it, I finally gave up and found it here.It's a whole grain mustard with horseradish and I use it all the time for brats, knocks, and even for my corned beef, which everyone wants the recipe for (secret - the mustard & brown sugar!).Now I have to order it, 6 bottles at a time, but I don't care because I always have it on hand!"
4,good intro to b-school for the non-MBA,"Good intro to b-school for the non-MBA person or for someone who is looking to enter b-school soon. Also, can be used as a little refresher for long-time graduates, but don't expect to be able to run a business simply by reading this book."
4,"Make sure you pick up the remastered version with ""Devil In Her Heart.""","This CD has two versions, ""The US version"" and the remastered import version, which contains ""Devil In Her Heart."" Funny thing is, I have a cassette of this album that I bought at a discount store back in 1983, and that song was included on the initial release. Why did they delete this great song when they began to manufacture CDs in the late 1980's? The remastered version also includes ""Blinder"" and an extended version of ""Empty Rooms."""
3,GOOD BUT....,"Good but ""CORRIDORS OF POWER"" is much better. ""VICTIMS OF THE FUTURE"" has some really weak spots."
5,A Great Guide for Disney Lovers,"I thought this book was well written and easy to read, and the content was wonderful. It was so helpful, it saved me time and money going to Disney. If you are going, you really need this book."
5,bubba jr,"wow,what a book!i love doc, growing up i coppied him,i will admit it.my problem was i had a 84 mile per hr fastball that in canada was not good enouph to even get a look.i was fortunate,in that i found fame in another sport called curling.i am a huge drinker but have never tried drugs,i do have money but the thought of drugs never interested me,thank god!0n the world curling tour i have had plenty of oppertunity to go astray and have,with booze on many occasion.i often wonder what could have became of me if a scout by the name of itchy jones (cin reds)said at 16 yrs your fastball isnt good enouph,can you backcatch. i guess what i am trying to say that doc is a study of too much too young just as i was.my curling fame came at 16 and 17,then again when i was 28-29.this story does hit home and i would reccomend it completely to young and old alike.nice job bob,look forward to reading your next. please excuse the grammar ha ha i wrote this late."
4,An unique effort by the Author,There can be nothing like this particular book for it's views on every curiosity in the W W W - the Whole Wide World !
3,"Great info, bad images","The content itself in this book is very interesting and helpful in learning about how to assess and treat stuttering. However, my only complaint Is that all of the figures in the book were not printed out well. All of the images are fuzzy and texxt is blurry so it makes it difficult to read."
5,"good book, good condition","I' m a Speech Pathology Student that speaks English as a Second Language, but the book it's so well redacted that is easy for me to understand it. Thanks for the fast delivery."
3,Haven't used it for practical application,"This was a required text for a class, but I have never used it while practicing speech language pathology. I only ever used it for class."
4,Great read but ...,Great read and very helpful. I recommend it if you live in a redneck area and your children's friends likely have alcoholic parents. My one caveat is that it needs a translation into Finnish.
5,jett williams rules,"Jet Williams is by far my favorite. Her music is alot better than Hulk Hogan and the Wrestling Boot Band. She will be a big star before long cause she already is huge in Lafayette, TN. ..."
1,Inferior product - not as described or pictured,"The Karcher hose Amazon supplied was NOT as described on the Amazon Web-site or in Karcher publications...- The hose was a smaller diameter- The coupling did not have the black molded gripFrankly, I was very disappointed that Amazon would attempt to sell a distinctly inferior product as a higher grade item. I am even more surprised that Karcher would produce the inferior item and label it as the higher grade item."
2,Extension hose,The extension hose is not the same quality as the one shipped with my pressure washer. The hose kinks very easily and very tightly. I am concerned it will rupture at a kink some time during my use.
1,Waste of time and money,"This is not a ""guide"" by any stretch of the imagination. It is simply the author's opinion on a number of subjects. It will go right into the recycle bin (not to the used book store!)."
4,Buy it for the classics,"The playing on this album is extremely strong and consistent for a live recording. Very impressive control on the two standout tracks, van der Linden's clever arrangements of Gershwin's ""Rhapsody in Blue"" and Barber's ""Adagio for Strings."" These two tracks alone are worth the price of the CD. Torke's ""July"" is a semi-minimalist piece for sax quartet that has been played a lot lately; I'm not a huge fan. The last track of the CD is pretty embarassing. I'm sorry that this brilliant quartet tainted their otherwise strong CD with Dramm's hollering about Thelonius Monk being ""the original GANGsta."" I guess it's all in good fun, though, and the track has resulted in some hearty laughs and inside jokes. Overall, this CD is a good representation of an outstanding quartet."
5,One of the best romance novels I've read.,This book held my attention from the begining. I couldn't put it down. This was my first book of Hannah Howell and I am a fan! I want to read the others books that are related to the characters in some way. Sigimor was so precious!
1,Debian GNU/Linux,"'I live in low-land Guatemala. The heat and moisture kills. Our ISP uses an airconditioned building to run our up/dn link and Wlan. I pay.We do not have, and can not afford, hand-held alphanumeric presentation systems. It appears that with Debian's tying of installation information to hand-held fragile presentation systems then, Amazon must wait for a new paperback book to sell to us.I greatly do not like back-tying products into systems that must be purchased, and then they do not function in low-land Guatemala."
2,Microsoft is great with software but not with documentation,I ordered this book as well as Special Addition Using Ms FP 2003 The only FP2003 book you'll ever need. This is the book to get!! The microsoft book does not really do a good job of fully explaining the topic. To me it was very confusing. The other book I just mentioned is 3 times as thick and goes from very basic to very advanced. So as you grow the book will be there for all the information. I will be returning this book and keeping the Special Addition.
4,Excellent Book. Information extremely well organized!,"This book is full of extremely well organized and clear grammar information. It has lots of examples and some excercises. I strongly recommend it. It's been very helpful for me as an English learner. However, after reading more than a third of this book, I have found several typographic errors that - even though are not critical, - might cause confusion to the reader. Nice and very useful book anyway."
5,Fits my Canon Powershot S1 IS perfectly with the accesories,"I bought it for my Canon Powershot S1 IS. THis one fits the camera, the spare batteries and the spare meomry cards perfectly without getting bulky. The shoulder belt is just awesome. Used it the entire time when we went to Yellowstone National park. Great buy!"
5,Great bag of the Canon S2,I got this bag for my Canon S2 and works perfect. Fits the camera exactly and have a small pocket for extra batteries and memory.
3,OK - Not great,"This book was my first by this author and probably my last. The good part was the story plot line was interesting (however, I see by reviews of the rest of the series that the plots stay the same so that is why this is the only one I will read.) I thought that the characters were well developed.The Cons - I found the writing at times a bit melodramatic and like a bad soap opera. I wish that there had been more reason for attraction between the main characters then just happening to be in a certain place at a certain time. And, I know that other reviewers commented on the use of ""god"" in the conversations, and repeated use of the names of the characters.Anyhow, this book is not a ""keeper"" for me."
5,What fun!,I looked up the personality profiles of everyone I know. I found it accurate and insightful. This book helps me get an idea of what my dates really have on their minds. I loved it!
2,Dante deserves better.,"This is a rather misleading 'modernthink' interpretation of 'Commedia'. ( Jung ?! )If you liked the few terca-rima fragments of Dorothy Sayers get her version, oreven better, Laurence Binyon ( hard to get)To get a basic grasp of Dante's work look at the Sinclair version which is very 'literal'and has extensive notes. The facing-page original terca-rima is easy to browse for key passages.There is online Yale open course by Prf. Mazzotta using this text -- very, very good !"
3,Writing Sci-Fi,For me it was more technical that I wanted as I wanted it for sci-fi/fantasy. Did give some good ideas about where to go to find out science stuff.
4,Successful Paralegal Job Search Guide,"I tnjoyed reading this book (it took only a few hours). I found the information to be helpful, but I would have appreciated more."
4,Great book taught me what i wanted to know.,My name is Thomas Miller from NY and when i were thinking of going into the Marines a friend suggested this book to me I loved it and could not put it down. I had doubts before reading this book about going into the Marines I thought of other branches but now its different Marine Corps all the way! Semper FI from a future Marine.
4,"A very informative and ""tell it like it is"" piece.","A very good book about Marine Corps training along with personal feelings and insight from both recruit and author!Explains that because of legislature, Marine Corps boot camp is not what it used to be and that the drill instructors are limited in how they train."
3,Wish he could revise the book its 20 plus years old.,"I read this after graduating high school over 20 years ago. I like how informative it was. Since I did not think I could come closeto USMC run standards I stayed out. Years latter I joined the Army at the time I was glad I did. Now, if I were younger andnot injured I would prefer to join the USMC of today because of their hand to hand fighting techniques, leadership skills, andnetworking skills that put the French Forigen Legion to shame. Wish the Author would republish the book with updates as the Marines reallyare the fighting force of the future the Mobil Marine Unit."
4,a great book for students and beginning vets!,"I used this book as a student during my emergency rotation and to study for exams. I've also used it as a vet - it's a great way to review material. it's fun! the questions are accompanied by color pictures (though some are dificult to interpret due to their smallish size), and the answers are comprehensive. I highly reccomend this book to final year vet students!"
3,Nice Book,"This is a good book and I got plenty of information, but felt it lacked some detail, thus the three stars."
2,Nota So Gooda,"Annie Goldman and Joe Russo should have been a great love story - imagine the Thorn Birds - a man is a priest and is pining away for a woman he once loved. He quits the priesthood to be with the woman.. And.. Everything should be romantic and beautiful, right? Wrong. Although the love story could have been great, it wasn't. Annie and Joe were both one dimensional characters with barely enough substance between them to keep the book interesting. I wasn't impressed with this book, despite liking the first book The Trouble With Mary. What to do About Annie was missing the humor and wit that was evident in the first book, and it was also missing the romance and likeability. Skip it."
4,not terrible but not real accurate either,"Amazon has this at a great price, I paid almost double at a local Target store. However I found that this device was still a little off, maybe 10%, compared to a manual blood pressure monitor. It's especially sensitive to the testee moving around even a little during testing.Maybe in another 10 years they'll finally perfect this technology."
4,Great Stuff,"Franklin Bruno is without question the greatest in the overflowing genre of rockstar/substitute teacher/Josh Mostel lookalike. Not their best work, but a great NPB primer for anyone unfamiliar with the band."
4,Sometimes cleverness is a good thing,"These guys are funny. But not in the obvious Bloodhound Gang way. More like how David Foster Wallace is funny, subtle, clever manipulations of language mixed with detailed observation and feeling. The songs are filled with witty insights and references, delivered in Franklin Bruno's full, wailing voice. Examples--A scenario from ""Drinking Game,"" a song about unrequited love for a tease: ""Sitting on my lap at a party / naming things that we've never done / You can hardly come up with any / I can only concentrate on one.""Or, a line from ""Career Day"": ""...that sharpened sense of the Kafkaesque you coveted and feared...""Great lyrics set to extremely catchy, hook filled power-pop. It's not rocket science, but it's good stuff. Hard to compare them to anybody, maybe lyrically similar to Ben Fold's Five, musically similar to . . . I don't know, but some of my favorite bands are Guided by Voices, Pavement, The Promise Ring, Weezer, so maybe that helps."
4,Entertaining Enough to Finish,"This book reads like many other books of its type - fast paced, superhuman-like central characters, and a twsit in the plot at the end. With that said, however, this book isn't that bad, especially if you are looking for a quick read that will keep your attention. I don't think ""Hour Game"" was one of Baldacci's best books, but it did capture me in the beginning and kept me reading to the end. There are a lot of characters in the book and the story does somehow entagle all of them in this small Virginian town murder mystery, but Baldacci does a good job at keeping the story flowing and does not confuse the reader too much. In any event, this book served its purpose - I didn't learn anything but it entertained me as I travelled this past week."
3,Lesser Baldacci....lacks his usual smooth structure,"I dunno, maybe I was spoiled by his earlier books, but this one jams in a lot of murders, a lot of unlikable characters and a couple of action scenes.THE GOOD NEWS: The action sequences second to none, but they are too few and too late.THE BAD NEWS: I just gave up keeping all the relationships and motivations straight, not because it gets too complicated (it does) but because you just don't care.COMPARED TO HIS OTHER WORK: Earlier work had individual plot threads build slowly, gradually coming together until the whole structure becomes clear and then topped off by an race-to-the-finish ending.THIS TIME: In his attempt to cover TOO much, all the plot threads are short-changed I just didn't care who did what.Attempts at witty banter between the two heroes falls pretty flat.His last book (Split Second) was not bad, but this isn't even close to THAT one!"
1,VERY bad book,"I have read several of David Baldacci books and have enjoyed them. I'm sorry that I can't same the same about this one. It started off alright but went quickly down hill. The plot is so far fetched as to be completely unbievable - not one, but two killers running amok killing everyone in sight! I can't believe it would anyone as long as it did to figure it out, if for no other reason that there weren't many characters left alive to be the killer! I know I wouldn't pay Sean and Michelle to investigate anything for me! I'm hoping this book is the exception and not the rule going forward or I'll have to scratch Mr. Baldacci off my list of authors to look for."
1,I don't understand ....,"how this author appears on the best seller list so often, that is unless his other books are leaps and bounds above this ""work"". I am an avid reader and I must say that I have never (ever, ever) read a book with a plot so convoluted, so full of such insipid dialog nor so self-serving in it's solutions to the events that take place to be, well, laughable.My recommendation: To avoid insult to your sensibilities as a reader avoid this tripe, and move cautiously into any of the other mulitude of books written by Mr. Baldacci.Avid Non Avatar"
4,"True, not one of Baldacci's best, but still a great thriller","I must say i have never spent such a long time reading in one sitting as i did this book. The characters are not as deep as other characters Baldacci has written about in the past, such as the characters in ""The Winner."" There are a lot of people to keep in mind while reading the book, and it is important to remember their jobs and what their role is, which is hard at times because there are so many of them. It is a great thriller nonetheless and is fun for those who like good whodunit novels"
3,By far not Baldacci's best,"Albeit you can have a good time reading this book definitely is not a thriller. Some times you won't know what to do, watch TV or read the book. The beginning of the book is very good, but as you read is getting worse and worse but the end is the worse of all. With a quick sleight of hand Sean knew who were both killers and why, I read that part of the book three times and I still don't know how he knew all those things. Sincerely are much better books than this one."
2,WHEW! An average book full of people and killings,"And I thought Ken Follett's ""Pillars of the Earth"" had a lot of characters!!! In reading ""Hour Game"", you might need to keep a list for all the people introduced - some propel the plot and others are just names. There were so many murders of such violent types that even they were not shocking by the end of the book (and I did finally make it to the end). The two main characters - Sean and Michelle - are fun to follow and smart in their deductions, but this book was overlong by about 100 pages with just too many subplots that led me nowhere. I enjoyed ""Split Second"" much more and was hoping for better."
4,Good Story,It was a very interesting story. Not a real page turner but still very interesting. Not his greatest but better than others.
2,A never ending melodrama,"Ever been trapped watching or reading something and you'd just wish it'd get it over with?The Hour Game was supposed to be a well thought out serial killer novel, according to the author. Instead what you have is someone murdering people one right after another, slowly widdling down the characters until you're left scratching your head because there's nobody left! The plot takes forever to develop and the characters seem like half-wits bent on either revenge, money, or hate.Our two main characters are supposedly the only smart people in this small virginia town, why, because EVERYONE else DIES!The plot and the various sub-plots would've been better if they had been highly restriced to a specific few cases. When all of your characters start dying it becomes pretty obvious half-way through who the real killer is. Baldacci should stick to what he knows: Washington D.C. and the power politics. Murder is just not his ""game""."
1,Pure Trash,"I was a David Baldacci fan until I read Hour Game,which is about how long it took to realize that this book was a waste of my time. The ridiculous plot lines,laugh out loud live saving scenarios and inept law enforcement characters make this a total waste of time as well as an insult to your intelligence. Like Grisham and Patterson, Baldacci has decided to pump out trash for the quick buck. I think it is possible that he wrote this while in high school. Stay far,far away from this one."
1,David Baldacci will not be a must read author for me again,The Hour Game was hard for me to really get into. It was just too much going on and none of it going anywhere. It was so frustrating that the only reason I continued reading the book was I always finish what I start.I have been a Baldacci fan for years but his past few books have left me disappointed more each time. This was the worst by far. Mr. Baldacci needs to quit speed writing trying to beat the contract deadlines and go back to when he first began to write.
3,"Well, it is a novel that is hard to put down . . . but",". . . the author blew all possible believeability in his writing when, towards the very end of the book, he writes, ""She couldn't know it, but Eddie had at the same time been circling around her and had fired at the exact same instant as she. Beating odds of probably a billion to one, the two bullets had collided, causing the explosive spark she'd seen."" After reading that I felt I had a Jon Stewart look on my face -- and I was by myself. For me, it ruined the whole book. That one paragraph could have easily been left out and not changed the book at all. Why did Baldacci feel compeled to put it in there? I mean, c'mon ! ! !"
1,"Far-fetched, formulaic and confusing","Feels like I wasted SO much time reading this, jotting notes to keep straight who-was-who-killed-by-who. Then, at the end, when the ""heroes"" are attacked again, a one-in-a-billion lifesaver: one hero and one bad guy shoot at the same time and their bullets collide, saving the hero from certain death. Gag me."
2,Depressing Serial Killer Story,"The storyline of this book actually really bored me. It took me a life time for my standards to read it beacause the plot has no thread to it, is confusing and not very ""mind-sticky"", the two main characters have a nice personality, but the serial killers homicides lack completly of immagination as does the killer and the characters that circle around the story. I do not recommend it personally. The only good thing is that you are not sure of who did what untill almost the end (at least I was not but maybe I got so bored I did not see it), but the mind of the killer/s and the reasons are lame and all in one there are nicer books to spend your money in."
2,"weak writing, weaker plot","Baldacci's writing style is on a par with that of a skilled high schooler. What has made his books enjoyable to read is his imagination and interesting plot lines. This is one you'll completely forget in a week. Either he has run out of interest, or is tired of putting in the necessary work to write a better book. Your time would be better spent finding a Scott Turow novel you haven't read."
3,Much too complicated,"I have always liked David Baldacci's novels because they had good plot twists. But this time he got carried away, too many characters, too much gore. The detailed description of grisly murders was not necessary."
2,Had to put down,"I liked the two main detectives, but thought the added story of the burglary stalled out the lack of depth on the serial killer's story. I just couldn't keep reading about one murder after the next."
2,Not That Great,"I've never been satisfied with Baldacci's works. I don't like his simplistic writing style or plots, and this book is a fine example of what troubles me with his work. He takes what should be a great plot -- suspenseful intrigue -- and really does nothing with it that hasn't been done before."
2,Not Worth the 25-Cent Cost,"When I found ""Hour Game"" in paperback at our local library's monthly book sale, I thought I had hit pay dirt. But I cannot believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as ""The Winner"" and ""Absolute Power"" could turn out such a dog. Long, boring, and confusing. I fear that Mr. Baldacci hired an ""aspiring young writer"" to ""help"" him crank out a quick book. I cannot pass this book along to my friends -- I couldn't do that to them. It will be tossed into our blue recycle bin. What a waste. What a shame."
3,More like 2 1/2 stars....,"This is the first Baldacci novel I've read, and it held my interest through out. Not bad, but not great, either.The plot itself was a rather interesting one, and I found the homage to serial killers to be rather compelling. However, the way the mystery unravels is rather disappointing and I had a hard time finding either of the two main characters to be very likable. I grow tired of these uber-characters that are alphas in every aspect of life. I know this is just escapist literature, but, give me a break.....A male and female partnership like that being platonic is also rather unbelievable."
1,A standard setter,"This book sets my standard for one of the worst that I've ever listened to. A friend bought the set of CD's and based on the Baldacci name, I made the error of uploading the CDs into my computer - at least I didn't compound my error by spending my own money. I then completed my error by listening to this ""book"" and actually finishing it. The plot is trite and full of holes, the characters are not even two dimensional, and the writing is sophomoric. I previously read one Baldacci book. I won't read another after this junk."
5,America's premier uilleann piper,Count on Jerry O'Sullivan to deliver consistently excellent pipe performances. O'Sullivan Meets O'Farrell is no exception. This recording deserves a place in history as well as a place on your CD shelf.
4,Matched,"This CD is just as great as ""Infest"". A little different, but still very great music. I suggest you buy it as soon as possible!"
4,A Ranger's Heart,"Beautiful young Billie Bahill was determined. Despite what her father said, she knew her fiance wouldn't just leave her. So come hell or high water, she was going to go find him. So what if he rode off into the deadly Superstition Mountains? Billie was as good on a horse as any of the men on her father's ranch, and she wouldn't let anybody stop her-especially not the Arizona Ranger with eyes that made her heart skip a beat. Ranger Sam Gray was on the trail of a pair of killers. But when he found the feisty tomboy alone in the Superstitions, he knew he had to bring her back home for her own good-no matter how hard she fought him. Sam was used to gunmen shooting at him, but he soon realized he faced a new kind of danger with Billie-the danger of losing his heart."
1,Another misleading title,"This is another book with a misleading title. It appears to me that the author has taken a college lecture , xeroxed and folded it and now call it a book. First of all I suggest that the author obtain an editor, having said that , I find the approach very difficult to follow. The book misses many important topics such as coverage of buffers. Case studies are numerous, but I do not see any explanations. Overall , you can find much better content on the web for free. There are a couple of nice pearls in the book ."
3,Sharpe's Fortress: India 1803,"Sharpe is currently stationed in India, having just fought at the Battle of Assaye, and barely escaped, nevertheless saving Britain once again. He has recently been promoted to ensign. With high hopes, Sharpe is then moved from platoon to platoon, the level of job satisfaction decreasing each time. He knows his job sucks, but as he looks up on that hill, he sees a hope, as revenge boils the blood in his heart. On that hill sits Gawhilgur, and the year is 1803. It is where he must wage war once more, but now he has deaths to avenge. His time the siege will be hard, the fortress almost impenetrable, and Sharpe will be stretched to his very limits.Originally published on April 15th 2002.For over five hundred more book reviews and exclusive author interviews, go to BookBanter ([...]."
3,Somewhat formulaic,"Of the four prequel pre-Peninsula campaign Sharpe's books this is the second worst. Cornwall seems to have written these more for the money than anything else. Tiger and Trafalgar I'd rate a four, Triumph a two. Hakeswill is in all three land based novels and a female relationship in three out of four. Cornwall seems to be writing by the numbers. Hakeswill escapes all the deaths that Sharpe arranges for him, as we know he will, but nothing is done to him, officially, even though higher up officers learn of Hakesill's nefarious deeds. Sloppy loose ends on Cornwall's part. As always, an interesting way to learn about British military history."
5,Love this!,"I've tried a lot of perfumes, and it's is the only one I can really call ""my own."" Smells softly fruit with a calming effect. It's now my signature smell and I get comments on it all the time!"
2,don't care for it...,"I received an imitation version of this perfume, and loved it so much, I went looking for more. Unable to find it, I forked out the money for ""the real thing"" here. Yuck! I don't like the scent at all - and looking back wish I had returned it for a refund. It's sweet and pungent, and nothing at all like the imitation version I loved so much. One possible explanation is maybe my bottle was exposed to extreme temperatures (heat) in shipping, since I do live in Arizona. If I ever come across a sampler in a store, I will definitely check it out and report back."
1,Not so sure.,"I bought this perfume, because the bottle was really cute so I figure cute bottle and Hilary Duff? Its got to smell great! Well I'm not so sure about the smell. I'm 22 and also a perfume lover. I love all kinds of smells from elegant to fruity smells and have over 50 bottles from cheap to pricey. This perfume I was not impressed by. The vanilla was way too strong and has an after smell of old lady and black licorice. I thought maybe I sprayed too much or was just having a weird smelling day, but I've let a few people smell it and they all say the same thing. One of my friends loves this perfume so I gave it to her so at least in some way it was money well spent! So if your a vanilla and/or black licorice person you'll love it and if not maybe this perfume is not for you. Hope this helps. Sorry Hilary I still love your music and movies!!"
3,"Great scent, but doesn't last very long on the skin....","I was suprised by this one. It was really nice. It's definitely NOT a fruity floral. It's a warm oriental. The base is a blend of very light mossy woods. It has a very light pretty milky amber note that is infused with bubbly florals. If spiced champagne had a smell this would be it! I really like it.It was developed by perfumers Rodrigo Flores-Roux and Stephen Nilsen. The notes as listed by Duff include: mangosteen fruit, exotic spices, chai latte, mangosteen blossom, cocobolo wood, balsam, incense, amber milk and amber musk.My only gripe with this one is that, on my skin the lasting power is horrid! It only lasts 10-20 minutes if that long. It seems to last much longer on fabric tho. If the lasting power were better I'd have given this a solid 4 or 5."
2,Eau du Anti-Histamines,"I'm sorry, but this is another pop-star fragrance that I really don't care for (another being Britney Spear's ""Curious"").I was given a sample of it at Walgeens the other day. It's too sweet smelling for my tastes (my mother said it smelled like air freshener), and I think I had an allergic reaction to it.I got a rash. Also, that night I woke up to find my left eye was starting to swell shut (I had not even sprayed it on my skin that time). After removing contaminated articles of clothing and using hydrocortizone, symptoms vanished within an hour. Take that, Hillary Duff."
4,GOOD SINGING,"I'M A FUSSY PERSON WITH MUSIC, BUT THIS CD HAS GOOD SONGS,AND REAL GOOD JAZZ FEEL, AND REALLY GOOD ARRANGING;"
5,Just what the doctor ordered!,"This holder is exactly what I needed to organize my batteries in my SLR kit. It is well made and designed, as small as you can expect for 16 ""AA"" battery storage and the red flag flap for expended batteries takes the guessing out of battery selection. There is a Velcro and snap strap on the rear that allows secure mounting of the case to your camera bag or backpack. It may be a couple of bucks more expensive than the hard plastic offerings of other manufacturers, but it is also much more useful."
1,Autistic voice,"I believe the author is probably a high functioning autistic. It's not egomania, it's a brain that's wired differently. I agree that it makes for dull reading: "" I....I....I..."" The lack of social and historical perspective is a possible indicator for autism, along with the pedantic tone and the very narrow focus. There are many other books on chocolate that are much better, if it's chocolate you want to learn about."
5,transformative reading,"With clear explanations and lucid analogies, Thich Nhat Hanh points the way to an understanding of the ""historical dimension"" of every day life and the ""ultimate dimension"" of true reality, and shows that these two are not different from each other."
3,turns out not for me.,"Thought this was a players option, when i bought it. While i do DM now and again, i prefer to use the 3-3.5 system more. But it turns out; it makes a perfect gift for the 2-2.5 DM of your circle.It deal with everything that an 'overlord' Player would need his DM to know, but it was too much for this simple player. Gods Bless Dungeon Masters!!!"
2,Over rated and doesn't warrant repeated listenings,"I remember when this first came out and it was lauded as the greatest thing since sliced bread. From a historical standpoint, it came out during the early 1990's ""alernative music"" rage and critics were looking for artists to champion this new genre.While there are some interesting ideas and quality melodies, this cd is hurt by the poor production and too short length of the songs. ""I am a Scientist"", ""Hot Freaks"" and ""Smothered Freaks"" could have been so much better with higher quality production.In defense of GBV, they were truly a indie band and, for all I know, this was the epitome of a do-it-yourself work that was picked up by a label and then distributed.This was all the rage 20 years ago but there's a reason why you don't hear anything about it today. Perhaps this was a group that could have benefited from the feared commercialup-grade?"
3,Utility maximization as a theory of human behavior is a straw man argument by epigone academics exhibiting anxiety of influence.,"The rational man assumption is not a ""flaw"" of economic theory. It is just the difference between theory and empiricism."
2,Should have been so much better,"Jubilee Trail was my favorite book for many years and I was thrilled when it was made into a movie. The book is comparable to Gone With the Wind and would have made an almost equally epic movie. Unfortunately, they went Grade B all the way. Grade B actors, miscasting, terrible writing, cheap filming. It was terrible. I wanted to sit down and cry at what had been done to a wonderful story. I wish someone would film this story again and do it the right way but that ain't gonna happen."
3,Good tool,"Files cast rings pretty quickly and does nicely with steel rings.Only complaint that I have is that it is difficult to use with smaller bores (75mm/3"")but seems like it would work great for larger bores. I had to feed the ring in from the other side to file the smaller bore rings."
3,It gets the job done,"The grinding wheel, base and handle work very well, some burring depending on the ring material, the ring posts need to be re-designed because you have to hold the ring down and against the stop and push in at the same time, not easy and hard on the fingers. If the posts were a V shape and layed out so the ring was forced down when you pushed in it would be so much easier. It does not tell you which way to turn the handle and it's backwards which tries to ""pop"" the ring end up so for people that don't read instructions that come with their rings they can easily grind from the inside out and destroy a set of rings, especially L shaped ones."
5,Love it,"One of my 20-month-old's favorite books -- she asks for ""foo, foo, foo"" (full, full, full) all day long. The story of a warm, loving, large family dinner at Grandma's house is timeless and sweet. Living in a primarily caucausian neighborhood, I am happy to have children's books that depict diverse faces."
5,Great for Toddlers learning there body parts,The book is great for toddlers who are learning about body parts. My 21 month daughter asks me to read it everyday. Great book to add to your library.
1,Disgusting put down of the wiccan religion,How silly that someone took the time to connect the Smurfs to Satan. I find that if you think long and hard enough you will eventually turn everything into your own narrow views. Not a book to open the mind. Funny for wiccans though. Who would belive some of this?
1,Not That Organized,"This book wasn't that well written. The facts were missing or very shoddy, the content basically finger-wagging. Frankly, I find it appalling that a publisher even touched the manuscript. And as for Witches trying to target children to ""indoctrinate"" them -- take it from a real life Wiccan priestess. We aren't that organized!"
1,Ugh...not another one....,"Bright blessings to all, even those with closed minds and cold hearts. I can't believe the garbage that people can get away with publishing these days. I hope the author knows that he is now the laughing stock of my coven. Hey, how about researching the topic before you write a book? I have been a proud practitioner of the Craft of the Wise for over a year now, and I would like to say that this senseless drivel is laughable. I only wished that the one star I gave your book was a solitary pentacle instead!"
1,Christian hate-mongering is never-ending,It is never enough for Christians to abide by and be contented in their own faith and the glorious teachings of their Jesus Christ. That would be too simple. They must lash out and condemn everything that is not in their limited scope of understanding. This lashing out--without exception--includes venomous lies and outrageous claims not even in the same world as fact. Why is it that no other religious faith in this world sits about creating obnoxious missives about how evil and wretched Christianity is? Perhaps because we are too busy practicing what we preach and minding our own business. It is pitiable that such books as this ill-conceived and misinformative diatribe still exist in this day and age.
2,Please Hire an editor!,"This book could have used a good editor and proof reader! the story is not bad, but the errors and the improper use of the english Language is Jarring! The hook and the plot line have great possibilities but I would prefer better character development. Overall, I might have given this book 3 to 4 stars if it were cleanly edited. I recently read a very good thriller by a new author: ""Deviant Ways"" by Chris Mooney -- Hanible Lecter Watch out!"
3,Does what I need.,"This wallet does what I need, hold memory cards.Unfortunately, the clip on the back which allows it to attach to a belt or Sliplock loop (as on lowepro bags) is not super secure. The button snap comes apart easily, and the velcro is not as strong as it should be.The pockets are different sizes, and the smaller ones are a *very* tight fit for a compactflash card in its plastic case.A few small changes to the design of this product would make it absolutely perfect."
3,"Not Great, but usable","Fully extended, it's too short for me to use from a standing position, and I'm only 5'4"" tall.Also, the locking mechanism on the telescoping arm does not always stay locked.All that aside, it is quite sturdily made for the price."
1,Rip off - big time,"This CD is supposed to contain ""Thirty minutes of spicey talk leaving no doubt that The Girls are well and truly back in town"". Well, be that as it may, this CD certainly does nothing to prove it. Basically this CD is some 30 minutes of random 2 min. clips from various interviews. The sound quality of the clips vary from CD- to phonequality, but usually it's the latter. And all the while there's this annoying MIDI melody playing in the background. It sounds like a bloody video game. The production is horrible, the clips incoherent, and the melody in the background makes me want to have a fit. I have nothing against the idea of a CD with 30 min. of interview(s), but damn, this is so amateurish that it's hard to believe ""Chrome records"" (the label responsible for this garbage) haven't gone bankrupt yet."
4,Easy listening,"This is classic Hawaiian style music. From traditionals like the lovely, dreamy ""Sweet Lei Lehua"" to the loping cadences of ""Easy"". And then there are classics such as ""Mood Indigo"" Hawaiian style which conjures up images of palm trees swaying in the warm breezes of a beautiful sunset. The perfect CD for a romantic evening!"
5,Excellent pro-prohibition map,"I saw a copy on exhibit at the Boston Public Library. It's a map of the US with highly detailed info on the history and status of prohibition in every state. The map is surrounded by other data, such as a summary of the law, enforcement data, and the positions of various religious groups. Meticulously crafted, it makes an enormous amount of information comprehensible on one black & white sheet."
4,THE GREAT KRS-1 IS BACK AND STRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"KRS ONE'S NEW ALBUM ""THE SNEAK ATTACK"" IS JUST WHAT I EXPECTED FROM ONE OF HIP HOP'S PIONNEERS ILL. KRS BRINGS KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM LIKE ALWAYS ON EVERY TRACK. HIS FLOW IS STRONG AND MAKES SENSE BECAUSE MOST OF TODAYS HIPHOP (RAP) IS CRAP AND IS WACK. ALL THE SAME MATRIALIST B.S. ON EVERY ALBUM. KRS 1 MAKES SURE HE HATES ON ALL OF THAT. THE PRODUCTION ON ""THE SNEAK ATTACK"" IS JUST OK. HE HAS OLD SCHOOL BEATS LIKE FROM THE EARLY 90'S. THAT IS OK, BUT HE COULD HAVE HAD SOME PREMO, HI-TEK BEATS BUT HE DOES NOT. INSTEAD HIS ALBUM FOCUSES ON HIS LYRICS AND ""THE MESSAGE"" OF HIS MUSIC LIKE KRS 1 HAS BEEN SINCE 86. ALL OF THE TRACKS ARE GOOD, BUT SOME COULD HAVE USED A 2001 PRODUCTION TIP. IF YOU LIKE REAL HIP HOP LYRICS AND KNOWLEDGE GO PICK THIS ALBUM UP."
1,KRS-Done,"Rap is dead. Has been since 1991. In a genre more conservative than the Bush administration, KRS-One is an innovator. However, he is an innovator who LOVES to hear himself speak. What a blowhard. I am not sure if he could cram anymore ""messages"" into one album. I imagine KRS-One listens to a lot of talk radio while looking in the mirror."
3,Kinda dissappointed,"I should have sampled all the songs on this album. I was hoping it would be mostly upbeat, but it's not. Oh, well."
4,pretty good,"this cd's on a lot at work, and i have to say that it isn't that bad to listen to. if left to my own devices, i would probably only listen to one or two songs of my own volition, but the cd in itself has a nice easy flow to it. some songs can be rather melancholy if you're in the appropriate mood, but on the whole i'd say it's a light-hearted, easy-going album. at the very least worth a listening to, even in passing."
4,Really Like Her voice,She has a very beautiful voice and I really like it. I wish that the songs were a little more upbeat but the album is very solid. All the songs are good and I can sit down and listen to the whole album which says a lot because I usually get bored. I would recommend this album.
4,Big but not bloated,"I have the 2nd edition of Java in a Nutshell and it's less than half the size. Despite that, it there is no waste. The book sis jammed with all the basic information about the language, tools, and major packages of Java. A must have for Java programmers, professional and hobbyists alike. The only complaint I can think of is that some of the class descriptions are a bit light but really, it's just a reference and there's always Javadocs and Internet sources.A great feature is the binding. I know, the binding? With a book this size, it's real easy to crack the spine and end up with loose pages falling out. This book overcomes that problem. You can even lie it flat most of the time so that it stays open."
4,The life of Mani put to novel,"Maalouf always the humanist presents us with the life of Mani in the form of historical novel. Well written he brings to life the ancient East during this turbulant era of its history even the odd little bit previously unknown history (such as the Syrian or 'Arab' Ceasar (Even though Syria was not Arab at the time!))His books are always a pleasent read, this is no exception."
3,I was expecting a little more.,"This album is good, but I was expecting more. Perhaps I just liked the photo on the front (that's one of the reasons I bought it). I was expecting a little more sonic diversity like Eddie Jobson's ""Theme of Secrets"" or Rick Wakeman's ""White Rock."" It's good listening for a Saturday morning though."
3,Disappointing follow-up to story of I,"Now this is bad! Who needs pointless quasi-prog tunes spiced with brazilian rhythms and Pat's nasty synth on top of it all! Much worse tzhan Story of I, no comparison even. And these ballads! They are sooo boring, man. Only the title track is truly great. Maybe also track 2."
2,difficult to rate,This book is to difficult for OO-novices and too easy for advanced OO-practicioners. It has 450 pages approx. but most of it are just programming listings which are of no use to anybody
1,"The review sent by ""hcb@ibm.net"" was NOT intended ...","The ""hcb@ibm.net"" review/posting was intended to be a joke from one of the members of our project. There is NO ""hcb@ibm.net"" in Warsaw, Poland (it's a fictitious e-mail address). The guy writing the ""review"" has never been east of New York City - let alone Eastern Europe! So if you wish to provide credible reviews to your customers - REMOVE IT!!!P.S. As a matter of fact, most of the people in our project wish they had never seen this book!!!"
1,Save your time and money,"Well I guess a title like this helps sales but it's a pity there is so little content to support it.Anyone looking for some great use-case technologies will be sorely disappointed. And the process and project management content is stifling, cumbersombe and dated. There are many far more exciting, modern and lightweight alternatives than this mess."
1,Waste of money,"This is quite the worst OO book that I have come across. The presentation of OO principles is very confused, and even wrong in some key areas. The approach to use cases clearly comes from a distant planet - ""It's a use case Jim, but not as we know it!"". The title of the book is extremely misleading. As for the software engineering process presented herein - NOOOOOO! You CAN'T be serious! The process is just byzantine in it's complexity!A friend of mine sent his copy of this book back to the publishers and got a refund. I wish I had!"
1,"it doesn't have ""The Cat in the Hat"" or ""Green Eggs and Ham""","I did not buy this book, because it did not have the two Seuss über-classics named above. It does however contain ""And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street"", ""Horton Hears a Who!"", ""Yertle the Turtle"", ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas!"", ""The Lorax"" and ""The 500 Hats"" (the last of which I never heard).If you are just starting your Seuss collection, I suggest ""Your Favorite Seuss: A Baker's Dozen by the One and Only Dr. Seuss"", available on Amazon for about $10 more. It contains all the above and ""McElligot's Pool"", ""If I Ran the Zoo"", ""Happy Birthday to You!"", ""Dr. Seuss's Sleep Book"", ""The Sneetches"" and ""Oh, the Places You'll Go!"" in addition to the aforementioned über-classics ""The Cat in the Hat"" and ""Green Eggs and Ham"". 13 classic Dr. Seuss stories in all. You can't beat that with a three-handled, moss-covered family credenza!"
5,Super cute!,Cute book with 6 wonderful stories in it. I found it to be a good size not too big and heavy like other reviews had said. Its definitly a great price too!
4,Still is use!,"I bought this case many years ago for my daughter's 1st generation nano. Athough the nano has long been replaced by a newer generations, case is still being used! Not the nano skin, mind you, the big case which holds the nano and earbuds and charger! A good sturdy product. We have been pleased."
1,Swivel Sweeper 7.2 volt battery,"After charging battery as required and placing it in the sweeper, ran for exactly l-l/2min.Recharged again, and same thing happened. Dealer, upon my writing letter, had asked me to contact him for a replacement but in the meanwhile the hurricane came and was without power for over a week, so have lost that email and cannot contact him. Perhaps Amazon can pick up the ball and reach out to him about sending me a replacementg battery as he offered. Thank you."
1,Does not hold the charge,"I charged it as per instruction, 8 hrs. I even put the timer on so as not to overcharge. It worked a minute and then stopped. I'm returning it, but am resentful that I have to pay the shipping charges,"
2,It didn't fit.,"I ordered two ""original"" batteries. They did not exactly fit my ""original"" swivel sweeper, and one would not take a charge. I returned them as I could not use them."
3,Not exactly what I needed.,"I was under the impression that this was an exact replacement for our Swivel Sweeper Battery. Unfortunately, it was not. We have to wiggle the battery and adjust the connectors in the charger to it to charge. Also the charge doesn't seem to last as long the the previous battery."
2,not a good replacement for swivel sweeper battery.,"Battery would not stay connected to sweeper,had to hold tight with tape so it would run. would not stay charged but about eight minutes."
3,SWEEPER BATTERY,"REVIEW OF SELLER IS GOOD. REVIEW OF PRODUCT IS LESS THAN GOOD, BUT IT IS THE FAULT OF THE MANUFACTURER. THESE BATTERIES DO NOT LIVE UP TO THEIR REVIEWS.i HAVE BOUGHT THESE BATTERIES FOR SEVERAL SOURCES AND THEY JUST DO NOT LAST VERY LONG, HOWEVER THIS TIME THEY DID SEND SOME CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR HOW TO CHARGE AND RECHARGE AND STORE THEM. THESE INSTRUCTIONS HAVE BEEN FOLOWED AND I WILL SEE IF THE PRODUCT LAST ANY LONGER."
4,Swivel Sweeper Second Battery Replacement,I love owning and using the Swivel Sweeper except for the need to replace the battery after 14-16 months use. But being able to purchase this new one from Amazon was much less expensive and delivered in less time than the ordering from the company. The sweeper is now working like new.
2,Swivel sweeper replacement battery,"the battery does not fit snuggly into the receptor on the sweeper, so I have use a rubber band to have it work"
3,Battery life is important and at this time cannot be estimated or proven,"I cannot rate it higher because there has been insufficient time to evaluate longevity.Battery life is the most important factor.At this time I can only report the price was reasonable, the delivery time even at the holiday season was reasonable, therewere no difficulties with packing or billing so it is OK but unproven."
3,dont work well,They don't hold a charge worth a darn. Work for less than a minute before the die. Dont fit well. Very hard to get into or out of both the charger and the sweeper itself.
2,doesn't hold charge,"Good price, quick ship but doesn't hold charge for more than two uses. I love the sweeper but not the batteries."
1,Battery - for swivel sweeper,I was very disappointed in the product. It worked for 10 sec. and then stopped.I tried again and the same thing. Thank you Carol S.
4,Good introduction/review,"While this book is not written as vibrantly as ""The Reformation For Armchair Theologians"" (Glenn S. Sunshine, 2005) and while many of the illustrations (cartoons) are not particularly helpful, still this is a valuable book for those who want an accurate, well-balanced, and relatively easy-to-understand account of the life and work of John Calvin. While probably too detailed for most laypersons, this volume should be quite useful for most seminary students, pastors, and religion professors who want a good introduction to, or review of, Calvin's life and his considerable contribution to Christian theology."
5,Get ready for takeoff!,Wade Cook has put together all of the winning strategies to make money in the stock market in his newest book.
1,More Snake Oil,This guy knows nothing and was being investigated by almost every attorney general in at least 12 states. Save your money and search Google for Wade Cook and Deja.
5,Great Healthy Snack,These cereal bars are great. The ones with strawberry and blueberry are the best. They are chewy but still soft.
5,Another Gem,"This album gets more beautiful with every listen. It contains a lot of what Connie Dover does best - textured, moving ballads with a hint of the Irish and sung with Connie's admirably trained, richly textured voice. It also contains some uplifting jigs and an acapella that will bring tears to your eyes.No Connie Dover fan should be without this gem. And those who are hunting around for another mature, creative, somewhat Celtic artist to try - this is the lady and this is the album."
2,It's hit or miss with Sandra Brown and this was a ............,"miss. This book would have been great if it was comprised of only the first and last 5 chapters. Everything in between was a drag.The characters weren't the least bit appealing. Cat was Brown's classic independent-type woman and Alex was a cheesy portrayal of a ""tough-guy."" Their relationship wasn't believable beyond a one-night-stand.If you're looking for a good book by Brown read WHITE HOT or LED ASTRAY."
5,The Tudors...HBO series.,Great historical series. Have been interested in history all my life....read lots of books. This series added to my historical knowledge and was fun to watch too.
5,FANTASTIC,"I watched the whole second season in one weekend, I just couldnt stop watching it!! The sex, the intrigue, the power!!! I have season one and now two in my collection. I must have season three!! THIS IS A MUST HAVE!!!"
4,The Window Effect,"Rhys Meyers is of course a crazy choice for Henry VIII. I suppose he's better than Shaq O'Neal or Danny DeVito would have been, but not much. Having said that let me restrict my self to the Amazon VOD HD presentation.The picture is sensational. I had watched the previous first season episodes on DVDs. Those DVD episodes always looked good. Indeed I thought that that was as good as it got. Not so. The VOD HD picture is startleingly better. It has that ""3D"" quality that you read about on the video forums. It looks like a window not a film."
3,NO SUBTITLES !,"I bought season 1 and pre-ordered season 2 but was very disappointed to realize there were no Spanish subtitles, I like to watch it in English and read my subtitles. Also the Spanish audio track is difficult to understand. My mother tongue is Spanish."
5,Amazing,"I love to read and study the Tudor era. I have all 4 seasons of The Tudors and enjoyed the detail, costumes, acting, basically everything about the the series. The only thing that seemed a bit off was how handsome Henry remained throughout his life. In reality, even though he was handsome when he was young, he became disgusting as he aged. I plan to purchse the dvd series of the story that was filmed in the 1970's. I am sure is was not as grafic as this one was, but will be interesting to watch - I watched it when it was on tv in the 70's and that is what sparked my interest in this era of history."
5,hot,This was both sweet and bitter it was a gem to see ann and the king interact but the ending was so sad i liked all the secreat deals and the reformation the dvd were all done in great views makes me want to see what happens next time.
5,The Tudors Season 2,"After viewing Season 1 of the Tudors I waited in anxious anticipation for the second season to be released, I was not disappointed. It was absolutely great. I would recommend this to anyone who has a fasination with Henry VIII. The actors are great and keep you so interested in the story line. I have watched it many time. I am looking forward to seeing Season 3,4,5 & 6. Which I have read that Showtime will be doing. Buy the current 2 seasons and ENJOY !!!!!!!5 STARS in my book."
5,Loved Season 2!,"Another great season of this series. If you liked the first season, you will love this season!Characters get even better, plot gets even thicker, and the writing seems to have improved over season 1. There is absolutely no reason not to buy this season if you liked the first one.Enjoy!"
3,Fate,"FateInterestingly, Arthur exists s a miner character I am Morgan le Fay an Arthurian legend written by Nancy Springer. This book forces on Arthur's half sister Morgan and her struggles to deal with her new magical powers as she struggle with dealing with herself. What makes this book so interesting along with other events is that Merlin in almost all of the other book is described as a happy jolly man who helps Arthur with his kingdom, but in this book he is a dark sorcerer. As fascinating as this book seems it still consists as a not so long and thrilling as it seems at times hard to follow with some characters and events that took place in the thriller I am Morgan le Fay.This legend is recommended by this review to be read by middle school kids or someone who wants to read a unique version of the Arthur Tail. The twists are unique don'y let them fool you this is a great book."
2,Not for beginners.,"I have the ESPN ""Let's Play Basketball"" video with Coach K. of Duke. That tape is great for beginners because it focuses on fundamentals and drills. I assumed the same would be true of this tape. However this one is for a more advanced level. It doesn't talk fundamentals at all but rather subjects like base running, situational hitting (e.g., when to hit behind the runner) and tricking the hitter. It's fine for what it is, but it's not for kids who are still learning the fundamentals of hitting, fielding, etc."
3,As advertised.,"I bought his for a friend, i guess he liked it, never heard about it. If he would have not liked it I would have known."
3,Mcdowell,"This cd is on Curb not Epic and has a mix of originals and rerecordings it is worth it for the originals and the rerecordings are listenable ,but the originals are far better. The folowing are originals; ""Whats it gonna take"",""Change to me"", ""It's only make believe"",""Al tied up"",""Unchained melody"". I am not certain about""Bedroom eyes"""
5,Cool Bag,"A great bag for $10. Though my Canon S2 IS is a little tight fit, I dont mind since I have room for all my accessories. Definitely a great buy for cameras which are a little smaller than the S2 IS."
2,Battery already dying again,"Worked out fine on my lenovo at first, but about 7-8 months in, the battery is dying immediately even after fully charged and when computer is unplugged from wall."
2,Not nearly as good as the original,"This, sadly, is not as good as the original Merlin arc of songs on that CD. I was hopeful that the expansion of the concept would be a winner - as I really did enjoy the Merlin portion of the Merlin CD. It was not to be, however."
1,Junk. The thing was giving me high blood pressure ...,"... from the aggravation. Plus it squeezes my arm so hard it's like some kind of sick torture test. I think it's trying to see how much pain you can endure. I was fighting back, flexing my arm trying to pop it. My wife tried it and all it does is error out and make her arm go numb. I think I'm going to lower my blood pressure by going ""office space"" on it."
2,unhappy,did not like the contents..there was about 10.00 in candy with alot of shedded paper.I feel like I paid alot for a box.
4,Working with Blackberry 7290,"I have tried multiple wired headsets and the HS820 Moto Bluetooth ear piece for my Blackberry. They have all been either not loud enough or in the case of the HS820, bad sound quality. I decided to try the HF820 and it works really well. The volume is quiet good and the noise cancellation seems be quiet good as well as people I spoke to during my drive on the highway in my car, with windows up, didn't notice I was on the speaker unit.I didn't give it a 5 stars cause I wish there was someway to control the tone or adjust it. If it did, it would get my last star! ;-)So, I would definitely recommend it!"
3,Functional but not great,"I use this with my BlackBerry 7290.My primary motivation for buying the Motorola HF820 was that it would serve both as a car handsfree device while I was driving, and as a regular speakerphone for my blackberry 7290 at other times.Having used it for a couple of days, I would say it works satisfactorily but is not great. The voice quality could be better. You don't get a whole lot of controls other than basic volume and on/off buttons.One thing you might want to know:When your box arrives, you have to charge the device for 2 hours before you can start using it. Okay, you say. No big deal. Well, the annoying part is there's no wall charger included. I ended up buying an iGo charger ($29) from Radio Shack.It only ships with a car charger, perhaps because they expect you to use it in the car all the time. Well, since I am also using it as an add-on speakerphone for my BlackBerry 7290, I am disappointed that there is no wall charger included."
4,Review for Motorola HF820,This product is very good. I have had no problems.It works as stated in the product sales information.I am very pleased with the device. The only draw backis that it only has a car DC battery charger and no ACcharger is available. The DC charger takes approximately30 minutes to recharge.
4,Better but not quite there yet,"l've had various hands free bluetooth speaker kits and this is definately the best.Unit is duplex which really improves communication as car vibration and road noise can trick the unit into thinking you're speaking and cut out the other party.The non standard power charger tip is very annoying, and while the speaker volume is adequate, quality degrades the louder you go.Connects reliably each time (not automatically, you need to press the activate button), and works satisfactorily so l'm happy for now."
2,Not as good as I hoped,"When I saw this scrapbook I thought that it would be like previous movie scrapbooks that I've come across...but I was wrong! There were hardly any facts about the movie and was written from Alex's POV.On the good side there were some nice pictures of Rick so I did get something out of this so called ""Insider's Guide""."
1,The required software is not with it!!!,Had I not found this out I would have bought a useless book for my needs. The software code is only used once and then it is done. So the book without the code for course work is USELESSSSS!!!!!
5,Go to place for needed textbooks.,"Very pleased with ease of ordering, speedy delivery, perfectly packaged. Better than being wait-listed at campus bookstore or buying ""used"" item."
1,Annoyed,"I guess I should have read the description more carefully, but this book takes FOREVER to ship. I ordered it on the 20th of August and am still waiting for it to come. It's going to come on Sept 4. By then, I'll already be 2 weeks behind class. Not only that, I've just discovered that the price reduced to $45; I purchased it for $56."
3,compatibility,"This is a pretty cool product. I bought it to take black and whites, but I started accessorising it with all my other pentax gagdets(i.e. lenses, flashes, etc.) and so far they are all compatible. The auto-focus is quite speedy, it beats my K10D. The light meter is a little bit primitive and not so helpful, but you can use the exposure bracketing mode to compensate; however, it will be at the expense of sometimes costly film. I highly recommend this product for students and those who are seeking a lineage of gagdetry under the pentax brand."
5,Fabulous,Truly wonderful singing. Also an ideal recording in a pure accoustic that is custom made for this music.
5,Tres Magnifique!,"This is a must have for all LV officianados. I have been collecting and using LV for over twenty-one years. This is an excellent literary and pictorial compilation of La Maison de Vuitton. Cudos! to the author, publisher, and of course La Maison de Vuitton for their continued commitment to perfection, elegance, and extrordinary products. Cudos, to the artisians for their pain-staking perfectionism in creating such works of art. This book is a tribute to over 150 years of leathercrafting, and now within the past 5 years pret-de-porte, couture, and precious metals. Vuitton continues to allow those of us loyal to the House to continue pushing the boundaries of style and fashion,and subtly encouraging admirer's of the House to indulge.Life is a journey, so why not travel with the best. Well done LV! Tres magnifique!"
2,Locke,"I had to read this for class and oh dear, the man just talks in circles. Short book, took forever to read."
2,Not what I expected,"Maybe there are two John Locke authors. I was looking for one who writes mysteries and this was a much more learned treatise. It might be interesting to the right person, so this review is more my fault than the author's."
3,Light on Snow,I was just dissapointed in this book. I have read many of Anita Shreves books so I had such high expectations.I think it started out great then just lost steam. The Pilots Wife and Testimony held my interest much better. This book I could put down and hen go back to it later. A really good book I cannot do that with.
2,Not a Fun Story,The story is read by Alyson Silverman who does a fairly good job but it wasn't enough to make this story interesting. The story is from 12 year old Nicky's perspective some eighteen years after these series of events and Silverman does a credible job in having the listener believe she is Nicky. She has us feel sympathetic but often had me also feeling really down.The story is not a happy type of story to begin with and the subject matter left me feeling very depressed. I'm not sure what the author was trying to accomplish but it missed its mark as I don't want to read another of her books in this lifetime.
3,Could have been better!!,"I picked up this book because of the ratings on this website.It started great and I was hooked but half way through I thought it was just dragging on.I continued to read hoping it would pick up again, unfornutatley it ended and I was left with more questions than answers. It never did explain how the relationship between father and daughter got on. It felt unfinished. This could of been a wonderful book if the author would of added a few more chapters.I'm sorry but I don't agree with the rest on this one."
2,"Fast read, but not as good as other Shreve novels","I am a huge Anita Shreve fan and I awaited this novel with much anticipation. As with all of her novels, it is very well written, she makes you care about the characters, and she writes about their sad situation with poignancy. Some parts of the story are very, very sad and I believe she does a very good job of describing the pain and hopelessness of one who has suffered such a tragic loss.But .... the ending is just terrible. I was expecting a turning point for the main characters and, although this was hinted at, she stopped short of delivering. Even more annoying is the fact that there were many loose ends left untied.This is a good book if you're looking for a fast read with emotional depth, but don't expect a satisfying ending. A better choice would be ""The Weight of Water"", ""The Last Time They Met"", or my absolute favorite, ""Resistance""."
2,Really disappointing....,"I've read everything by Shreve I could get my hands on. When this one came out, I was really looking forward to it. It started out very interestingly and the idea was wonderful. She could have done so much with the story idea and the characters, so as I read, I just wanted it to keep going... But then, it seemed very suddenly, it just ended. I was totally confused. I had many pages left, only to realize that it was the author's favourite fiction and the reading group guide. I honestly feel cheated - there is no resolution to anything ... we are just left to wonder about all of it. It would be wonderful if she were to write a follow-up to this novel - I would look forward to that very much."
3,did I miss something?,This book had a whopping amount of potential and could have created one amazing work of fiction if the author would have stretched the limits. I actually thought several pages had been torn from my book because it made such a leap from suspenseful to bland and boring and completely took no risks. Seems like a waste of a read in that respect. I'm giving it three stars because there was more that I liked than I disliked but I think I am being generous
3,A Bit Light,"Although I thoroughly enjoyed this story, I felt that with some judicious editing, it could have been offered as a short story instead of a full-length book. I felt the length of the book was out of proportion to the actual events that took place over the couple of weeks that this story covered. Still, it was a great way to spend a few hours. I look forward to a meatier offering from Anita Shreve soon, as she remains one of my favorite authors."
3,Not Shreve's Best,"I bought this book as I love Anita Shreve's writing but in my opinion this book fell short. I thought the story started out well but then became contrived, especially the part about the mother of the baby staying with the father and daughter and the father allowing it. This just was not believable and I started to lose interest. I did finish the book but thought the ending left a lot to be desired. This was far from Shreve's best."
1,SLOTS,"ANYONE WHO REALLY BELIEVES THEY CAN BEAT THE SLOT MACHINES AFTER READING THIS BOOK, SHOULD SEE THE BRIDGE IN BROOKLYN I HAVE FOR SALE."
3,"The right lamp, poor packing.","This lamp was just what I needed to replace the burned out lamp in an inexpensive torchiere. Other bulbs I found were not the color temperature I wanted. The price was good, but the packaging was inadequate. It arrived in a box about 10 inches on a side with only a couple of pieces of packing paper in the box along with the bare lamp. The lamp does work fine in my fixture."
5,Big Potatoes with a heavy dose of sauce and soul!!!,"Soulful, funky blues mix that makes your feet and hips start to move!!! This man has a style all his own that is hard to resist!..."
4,Great product!,"I am in my mid thirties and my skin has changed dramatically in the last few years. I just can do the teenage products. PTR gets right to the cleaning and care of aging skin. I use this product in conjunction with the scrub which I love even more than this product, especially for removing dry dead skin and bringing out the inner glow without creatin a pothole in your wallet."
3,cheatin hearts,"this movie was good although it was depressing, the characters were such sad people. I think they could of done with less bad language. Swear words do not help make a movie better."
3,Good Hitch WRONG PICTURE,The product I received was a good product and did fit the truck even though it wasn't the same hitch that is pictured. The one pictured is a complete frame mount hitch where the one that matches the part number is a cross member and under bumper mount which is more what the manufacturer factory installs. Note: If you don't have a rear bumper on your truck then this hitch won't work. It is an easy bumper to mount much easier to mount than the one that is pictured. I have installed a couple of each type and both take less than 30 minutes to install. I am only giving three stars based on wrong picture information and the fact that UPS lost my first one I ordered.(How do you lose a 22 pound solid steel hitch???) UPS was able too! I do give credit to Amazon Customer service. I explain what had happened and they immediately re-shipped a new one and I had it on a next day delivery from FED EX. Great job Amazon Customer support.
3,better than rust but did not hold up like factory finish,"2nd product i've tried to re-blue my 'rustington' shotgun. Pretty easy to use and looked good after finished. But if you actually use your gun and it gets a bit wet from snow or whatever, it rusts through this gun blue. went hunting, got snowed on, rusted by time I got home."
2,Hole in mattress after one night,"Had the mattress one night, and the next night it had a hole in it."
1,early demise of a great bed!,I purchased this bed to put on top of another bed it was great for about five days...then it developed a slow leak.I could not find the leak to fix it!
4,Not Tha King Of Tha South But Pretty Damn Good,"Im 17 years old and im from H-Town,TX. T.I.'s album,""Urban Legend"" is a solid album. The first 4 songs are FIRE. After that tha album has some pretty good production and T.I. spits some nice lyrics. T.I. aint tha King Of The South, that belongs ta Ludacris right now. But, he is definately one of the top rappers in the south. Overall, T.I. is tight and Im lookin forward to his next album."
5,DOWN WITH THE KING,"THE KING DID IT AGAIN. URBAN LEGEND IS HERE AND HIGHLY ANTICIPATED. THIS ONE IS HIS FIRST AND SECOND CD ALL INTO ONE. TRAP MUZIK AND I'M SERIOUS WERE BOTH CLASSICS TO ME. OTHER ARTIST CALL HIM THE DOWN SOUTH JAY-Z. BUT IN ATL, JAY-Z IS THE EAST COAST TI!"
1,Another mediocre rapper...,"This cat, amoung others, seem to emphesize on the idea that money is everything. Okay, we gotta pay the bills but to center yourself around flowing about money, cars and clothes aint a good idea. Aint much to say except that this foo is wack..."
4,"In Urban, former inmate T.I. addresses his fellow rappers","T.I. recorded Urban Legend while in a work-release program for probation violation. But judging by his grudge-laden approach, he's addressing other violations as well - namely, claims by fellow Southern rappers that they're superior. Backed by synths for a sound he regards as counter-crunk, he lays out his defense in lyrical volleys aimed at rivals like Ludacris, and when he declares ''I'm the King,'' you just about believe him."
3,Not Trap Muzik.... but its a good follow up Album,"I noticed that this cd isn't nearly as good as Trap Muzik, however its T.I. with this variety of producers and rappers on it, its hot to certain extent. Some of the content is recycled as far as lyrics go and even some beats (lil jon's recycled drum set on Stand Up) but its a good rap album."
3,Not Bad,"Not too bad, but for someone who considers themselves to be the ""King of the South"" I'm a little dissappointed. TI's more like the court jester of the south.Tha King 2/5Motivation 3/5U Don't Know Me 5/5ASAP 4/5Prayin for Help 3/5Why U Mad at Me 3/5Get Loose 4/5What They Do 4/5Greatest 2/5Get Ya S*** Together 2/5Freak Though 2/5Countdown 2/5Bring Em Out 5/5Limelight 2/5Chillin With My B**** 2/5Stand Up 3/5My Life 3/5"
1,This album SUX!!!,"man, this album totally sucked! there wuz only a few good songs on the whole thing! anybody who bought this cd should take it back right away! its complete garbage"
2,Its ...aaight,"Is T.I. the king the south, umm who cares its the SOUTH who the hell wants to be king of the south. HA, anyway southern rappers are basically just starting under stand how to do hip hop and good for them ....but this best this and best that..we been through all that when hip hop started like 30 years ago in the bronx you (...) are late but its all good everone gotta get they shine. This cd is ......i don't know its cool just a regular hip hop cd...I been listening to hip hop for 22 years now its takes a lot to impress me."
1,Don't mess with a successful product,"I am very disappointed Northern has decided to reduce the width and number of sheets in its Quilted Northern Double Rolls brand toilet paper. I firmly believe if you have a product that is well established, well-liked, and sells well that you should be very cautious about changing the product in any way, especially when de-contenting it. Raise the price if you must, but don't make it less desirable to save a buck. It will come back to haunt you eventually. By the way, I've bought Quilted Northern for as long as I can remember. I've been very partial to the brand. But I'm not so sure going forward. Let's say I'm now open to changing brand loyalty without thinking twice about it."
1,They dont have a 0 star rating,"do me a favor....DONT BUY THIS BOOK,,,, i spent good money on it because as i searched it i saw a couple pics i liked!!! it is basically a catalogue, not anything more...it even has all the companies that the products came from in the back.... Pretty pictures,, but that is it. Honestly,,,I bought the Stanley complete basements, and it answered about 90% of my questions...and this one was like reading the sears catalogue....."
5,Loving Heinz Dill Pickles doesn't require you to be pregnant,"I absolutely love ""Heinz Genuine Dill Pickles"". I have four children who love them as well. Sadly, you can never find them in the grocery stores. It cost a great deal more to order them shipped directly to me, but if I can't get Heinz, I don't get anything. I am more than willing to pay the extra cost if that's what it takes. I hope they never stop making them. They truly are wonderful."
5,Great unique taste,My best friend got me hooked on these nearly 10 years ago when he would get some from another state as we dont sell them in ours. They are becoming harder and harder to find. These are way better than the garlic ones you get today. These are salty and have a brine flavor. Very good to cook with also! Youve never had a pickle until you tried this one.
4,Samsung Digital Thermometer,"It is one of the best medical product I have ever used. Small, handy and is good value for money !"
1,what a rip off,"I ordered these headphones thinking they would be a nice replacement for my Sennheiser hd202's that just went out. I couldn't be more wrong; as soon as I plugged these in, I quickly noticed that only the left side was working. I tried everything to see if I could get it to work, (maybe theres a short in the cord?), but to no avail. I don't think I would have very good luck attempting to get these replaced either. Do yourself a favor, DON'T BUY THESE HEADPHONES."
3,You got what you pay,"They don't have much of ear-exploding sound, but they are comfortable (if you know how to fit them). For 10 dlls it's a bargain, but could get better headphones for a little more money."
4,perfect for anything from ipod to keyboard,These headphones are perfect because of the fact that there is the mini plug that's for MP3 players and computers and a wider plug for my keyboard. The only thing is that the soft parts that go around your ears can sometimes fall off but it is pretty easy to fix it once you have done it once All in all just what i wanted.
4,behringer,"perfect for house hold and recording equipment, very bass punchy and crystal clear. The amp extension is what sold me works great on amplifiers."
2,"A bit of a let down, (edited)","First off, don't pay the scalpers prices, best Buy had like 15 of these on the shelf for $17 today.second...Poor choice of movie mix for this collection. Common sense would say Captive Wild Women should have been a 4 pack with Jungle Woman, Jungle Captive and Monster and the Girl.Certainly Night Monster and Man Made Monster are fantastic, must see flicks, but really now they should have been packaged with Mad Ghoul, House of Horrors, Murders in the Zoo and Island Of Lost Souls.A hit/miss package which obviously didn't have much thought put into it's content. I find that odd seeing how well a job Universal did packaging up their classic monsters series. I give 2 stars due to poor choice of movies in this collection."
2,Poor Quality,"I was sorely disappointed by the poor visual quality/sound quality of this package. The films themselves are just okay, not necessities unless you're a collector of old horror movies of dubious merit. I have a small collection of B-Horror from the 50's & 60's, mostly cult classics and British, some obscure. This set is not worthy of addition to the likes of The Crawling Eye (The Trollenberg Terror), City of the Dead, Witchcraft, The Blind Dead series, even the rather bizarre Kronos...much less worth sitting through. A very poor investment."
4,Universal Horror (5 movies),"THese films okay for generalized horror collection. Enjoyed. But Universal stops and starts before movie begins. Freezes, but movies were ok.Cecy Ivie"
5,Kinetic Quality @ bargain basement price,Gone are the days when you would have to shell out upwards of 4 big ones to get a decent kinetic. This one is all kinetic - feels great and looks even better. Solid build quality - you won't be disappointed.
5,Definitely Not Disappointed,"This is my second Seiko watch and am very pleased with it. I was looking for a watch with a plain face, but a little gold to keep it classy, and this one fits my criteria perfectly. Being Kinetic, it does not need battery replacements, which is a plus. Also, it has a little window in the back, which allows sight of its internals; very cool. The indicator is also nice to have, since it allows for a quick check of the power remaining, although with normal wear, there is not really a need to do so. If considering, you will not be disappointed."
2,I must have gotten a bad pair,"Mine were TERRIBLE. Focus is impossible! Focus adjustment is rough and sticks. If you try to fine focus, you go right past where you want to be..I thought these would be good binocs from the other reviews. The body is metal, but the eyepiece assemblies are completely PLASTIC. They warp and they are not quality. Even the eyepiece ""lenses"" are plastic, not glass. The main objectives are glass, but the eyepiece lenses are plastic. That's not quality in my book. I wanted to send them for repair, but Pentax wants me to pay $25 AND shipping, to repair them! That's not a warranty, it's highway robbery!.Never again Pentax!"
2,The 16x50's are terrible for football,"My daughter bought me the 16x50's based upon the comments that they were great for football. Perhaps the 10x50's are. However, I found the 16x50's totally unacceptable for watching a game. The depth of focus is incredibly small, meaning that items in front may be infocus but things a few yards back are out of focus. Trying to follow a play was also impossible."
5,"Hot as heck, nearly hurt my heart!!!!!!!!!!","I didn't read the serving size....1 teaspoon. I spread it like mayo, took a bite and the heat was crazy. I could feel a burning in my nose and I swear it felt like it went to my heart. I couldn't scrape it off fast enough. WHEWWWWWW!!"
1,xxx,"the gun doesn't work as promised, didn't have everything in the box that was stated on the box was in there. it is more of a hassle to use then it should be."
2,"For a good intro, look elsewhere.","Morricone has scored many movies, and there seem to be just as many Morricone compilations floating around. If you are looking for a good introduction to Ennio Morricone's spaghetti western musical style, look elsewhere- there are several good sets (like the excellent Ennio Morricone Anthology 2 disc set). Several of these songs are not originals from the movies, but campier (yes, it is possible) re-takes."
1,Horrible battery,"This phone started out great, no problems. But, after having it for about 5 months, the battery just quit. It can be fully charged, but it will only last for 10 minutes of talk time. Don't waste your money on this phone."
1,want to buy mine?,"the phone won't hold a charge. you can't ever leave it off the base or it goes dead. Target refused to honor warranty, told me to call Panasonic. The Panasonic Customer service number is always busy, can't get through. what a way to run a business..."
2,Marvel could do better.,"I don't own this product, but I used to own the individual DVDs. I don't own them any longer because I found them to be severely disappointing. They lack the appeal compared to the comics or other projects (Planet Hulk or the motion comics). The animations are okay, but that's as good as it gets. The stories are bland and lackluster and the characters will you leave uninterested. Overall, not Marvel's best efforts for animated projects."
5,Once a Slytherin...,"when the Harry Potter movies and books were released origionally, i was too young to watch them or read them. even as i grew up, i still wasnt allowed. The the end of last year, i finally was! and from the start i was a Slytherin. I bought the scarf even though i wouldnt ever be able to go to a movie or book release because the legend came to a end. It was a lot longer than i thought it would be, its longer than i am tall, but i found a way to wear it and make it look pretty normal. i do get a lot of strange looks when people see me wear it but it doesnt matter to me. The scarf is kinda itchy, but after about 5 minutes of wearing it, i didnt notice it. It was made wonderfully and it looked really awesome! it was my first internet purchase. my only complaint was that it took forever to ship (so it felt.) i got the 3-5 day shipping, and it took over a week at least. i havent wore it in a while since its so hot, but when winter comes, ill be ready. (:"
5,great scarf,This is now my favorite scarf ever. Its thick and just heavy enough to do the job without weighing you down. It's not like a costume scarf. This feels like something a real prep school would have.
4,Welcome to Hogwartz,"I hope you're not disappointed with the decision the sorting hat has made. With the wisdom that the hat uses to place you into the appropriate house, chances are you're very content with its decision.I bought this scarf for my boyfriend after the hat sorted him into Slytherin. It is a scarf unlike any other scarf--it's magic and it will keep you warmmmm. I'm not by any means saying that this scarf will make your life better, but it WILL solve all of your problems. At least that's what my boyfriend told all of his Slytherin buddies--in Parseltongue of course."
1,dont waste your money,"healing autism is better done with education than supplements. I fell into the trap of biomedical medicine with my son, I saw no improvements....with ABA therapy, head start and early childhood school has made all the difference"
3,video now player,this item is great for long trips and small children.It is easy for them to use.The buttons are large and it can be dropped from short drops and still works great.Has lots of movies or games to go with it to keep your young ones entertained for long trips or just around town.
2,What You See Is Not What You Get,"I ordered this as a gift for my boyfriend's birthday. Luckily he has a sense of humor, because when it arrived a) the Seiko box which held the watch was ripped and dented, which ruined the presentation and b) THE DAYS OF THE WEEK ARE IN SPANISH! The broken box and weekdays and spanish were disappointing."
5,great show,"Hi,Just wanted to say I really like the show and the picture, sound, and editing of the commercials was done great. I also got the complete Branded series. So far with this one it has exceeded what I thought the quality of the dvd's would look like based on the reviews.I hesitated buying these for a while because of some of the negative things I read in the reviews, but am glad I got them. I don't notice any issues.Also thanks for the previous reviews for giving me some help on purchasing the dvd set.Kevin"
5,another good read,"I have been an Ann Rule fan for many years, this book does not disappoint. It's chilling to see the extremes people will go too all in the name of greed."
5,Never disappoints,Ann Rule doing what she does better than most anyone else. If you enjoy true crime you have to like this one. Another keeper.
2,It's good and well marketed but not great,"When I first saw this book I thought the pictures were polaroid prints. I then found out that a bunch were ambrotypes. That's pretty cool, but they don't knock me out. Lots of nudes and flowers (some nudes and flowers in the same picture) and it starts to get repetitive. Aside from the process, the subject matter has been done and he is not breaking new ground. I like his editorial work. He is a gifted photographer and works very hard. This is a book of cash cows. If you have to buy this book, go ahead. You'll get bored with it after a while...."
2,Not an easy read,This is not a book preschool aged children have the attention span for. Kindergarten or 1st grade would be better suited for this story.
1,PLEASE AMAZON DO NOT SELL THIS ITEM!!!!,"I just had to look at the picture and it was enough for me. I just can't imagine putting that on my dog to train him. If I couldn't train him with love and understanding then what is the point! Why don't we put this on the person who designed the thing. I want that person to review the item after another person has given him a big jerk on it to make him behave.Sorry I gave it a star, only because I had to fill in the space. I don't rate it at all! I am very disappointed that AMAZON would even sell a product like this."
3,Needs to be re-examined,"This is a very difficult book to rate as the full facts about the Lockerbie affair has been covered up by both the UK and US authorities. Now, with the trial coming up, it is important to re-examine this book. Johnston book was published just before the official report stating that Libya was responsible for the downing of Pan Am Flight 103. During this time it was thought that Iran and Syria employed a Palestinian group to plant the bomb in revenge for the destruction of a Iranian civilian airline the year before.At the time, there was no mention of Libya being a strong suspect and Johnston concentrates on the Iran/Syria connection. Since the Forensics evidence implicating Libya is deemed to be invalid and more cracks appearing in the prosecution case againt the alleged bombers, it is time that the story that Johnston puts forward needs to be re-examined."
5,Best bet for visual learners,"If you are like me and need to see it in order to learn it, this book will prove hugely useful. Highly recommended."
2,"Good acting, but story horribly inaccurate","Barry Pepper was phenominal in his role, as were many of the other actors.But hands down, the lack of accuracy in many ways drags the movie down, especially in ignoring the man's trademark playfullness and practical jokes, while playing up the stereotypical ""race car driver with a deathwish"" angle.Huge, important chunks of history are missing, while ""famous quotes"" are inserted willy nilly, up to 20 years out of context.Forget the movie, and the DVD. Go find a good, accurate book on the man. You'll get much more out of it. Waste of very good talent in Pepper, and of opportunity to tell a very unique story. But, did you expect less from ESPN?"
4,Very nice fan,"We were looking for a fan for our kitten room. We raise Maine Coon cats and good ventilation is an important part of raising healthy kittens. I was concerned that the fan might not fit without removing the screen in our aluminum single hung windows since they are not very deep. However, if you lean the top of the fan in until the window sets in the groove on top of the fan and tilt the base out a bit, the fan fits fine and is quite secure. A minor complaint is that you have to cycle through all the modes to turn the fan off. I am quite happy with this fan and would buy again."
2,Not well thought out,Very poor product. The electronics work well but it is impossible to seal in the window for use without using a great deal of ugly foam or tape. It just plain does not fit an aluminum window.It is light and easy to handle and looks good. The amount of air that it moves is marginal at best. On high speed it is also a bit noisy.
1,Failed after 9 months! No replacements available.,"This unit failed after 9 months and while the manufacturer recognizes that it is in waranty and needs to be replaced, they have no replacement stock since they bring these units in from an overseas manufacturer on a seasonal basis. To make matters worse, their internal computer system doesn't allow them to automatically ship a replacement to a customer. The customer is reponsible for constantly checking their website to see if they have any in stock. If you happen to miss that window of them getting in stock and selling out, you have to wait and keep checking."
4,Nice little fan,"The fan works well, however, I wish that it flowed a bit more volume for two fans. It seems that the intake is stronger tnan the exhaust, but it works well, and dramatically lowers the temperature in the second floor bedroom."
5,BEST WINDOW FAN!,"This was my first window fan. It was soo great that i decided to go on amazon and get three more. Though i did not get this fan, i ended up getting the honeywell HW-628 fan, seeing all the good reviews about it. Well lets just say i was very disappointed. The honeywell barely have any technological advance to it. Cant control anything. It was weaker than this fan, and it doesn't have sleep timer, which is a must with every electronic, when you are a lazy person.This fan looks better and work better than the more popular honeywell, buy this and you wont regret it."
1,Disappointed in the quality,This is the experience I had. Right out of the box one of the fans did not operate. The electronic adjustments where a bit confusing for my girlfriend. We decided return this one and order the other brand that also began with an H and were much happier with that brand It is easier to use and seem to be built better.
5,I love this fan,"I had a similar model fan and WORE IT OUT. This one is even better because of the fact that you can turn the two fans different directions that allow you to circulate the air in the room. The thermostat allows me to set it and leave and it will regulate the temperature on it's own. Love it, Love it, Love it!"
2,Not what I expected,"Many seem to be happy with this fan. I find it to be extremely weak. it moves about as much air as a hand-held, battery-operated fan you see people use on the subway. I will return this."
1,Not UltraViolet!,"This is a bunch of black (space) light bulbs - literally. They're NOT blacklight (no space) ultraviolet lights as you would expect from the name, they're dark colored light bulbs. Somebody took a real cheap light bulb and painted it black, and it also burns extremely hot. Be forewarned, you're probably not going to get what you're expecting."
3,Shaves good but charger just OK,"This shaver does a good job of shaving my beard, but the battery charger lights don't properly indicate the state of charge. The battery runs out of power when the lights indicate that there is still 80% charge left. It is then necessary to shave with the cord plugged into the wall outlet. The ""reserve"" button does not allow the shaver to continue running as it is described in the manual."
4,My new Remington,"I bought the new Remington Microscreen 700 / MS-5200to replace the Remington MS3 1700 which became slow and keptdying on me. The new one is loud but it works OK, so far."
3,"Many problems... but in the end, worked well",I got a replacement due to only 5 mins operation on battery. 2nd one had same problem. Remington gave a free alternate model and didn't ask me to return the old one. I let it sit for some months. Then I charged it and it started working! Go figure. No problems since. There must be some sort of fluke where the battery won't charge initially since many people have had this problem.
5,Beautiful,It should also be made as a day calendar. The photographs are gorgeous. The tips on how to save the Earth make great goals for the day.
3,An Interesting View Of World War II,Although this is not a real chronologically ordered summery of World War II Mr. Keegan manages to capture many different aspects in a way that is understandable and informative. For a comprehensive overview of events that made up World War II you can't beat this book. It is more then just the battles but the human perspective as well. This book also includes moving pictures of the events as well as maps to help tell the story and put into perspective what you are reading about. Great reference material.
5,Best WW2 History,"I remember great things about this book even though I read it almost 10 years ago. This is a much finer history of the Second World War than any book I was issued at West Point. The book is very easy to read, and Keegan avoids the rote history narrative, and applies great analysis. The absolute best part of this book is the section on arms production. If you're not proud to be an American after reading that chapter nothing will! (The US outproduced all the other warring nations combined.) Keegan's analysis of partisan warfare during WW2 debunks the myth of the French Resistance."
2,Couldn't get it to work with my printer,"After a few hours of loading printer drivers and configuring the device, I just could not get it to work with my Samsung printer. I don't know if it is only to be used with Epson printers or something else. The documentation is poor so some experience around network printing is helpful in setting this up. At the $7 - $8 bucks to purchase the item it was worth seeing if it would work out. Too bad it didn't, I still have to use a computer to share the printer."
1,He's trying to sell his newsletter.,"First, this book deals almost exclusively in the futures markets, not stocks as I had anticipated. Second, although he goes into detail on many key issues (volatility, market timing, inefficiencies, etc.) he does not really explain how to calculate. I think it is an attempt to get the calculations from a subscription to this newsletter."
5,Gripping,"This book grabbed me and held me captive for two days. I had to finish it, no choice. Like every great read I was sad when it ended. I felt like I had spent a few weeks with the Korth family and got to know and care about them. I want to know what happens next. I feel like I now understand the recent history of Alaska in an almost personal way. I have spent the last 25 years in the Canadian North so I have some feeling for the material. This book feels authentic, the writer has a good ear, intuition and work ethic. I am going to buy his next book and see if this was just a happy accident. Well worthwhile!"
2,Nuit De Noel must be the Ghost of Christmas Past,"I got this because it was my moms signature fragrance, and I have fond memories of her wearing it, but apparently the makers have re formulated it because it smells nothing like I remember it, and I was sadly disappointed. I lost my mom to cancer in 2004 and I was looking for a way to have her around when I was feeling especially blue for her, I thought this would be the way. Now I have a bottle of perfume that cost me over $30 just sitting on my dresser.... this doesnt make me happy."
4,Science fiction like they use to make it in the old days,"How do you react when you find out there is a way to eternal life? You go afer it, especially when it comes with a beautiful women you fancy. The only problem is to find a parallel universe in which you have married here. And to find the fold in the time-line. But this is 1950 America, so anything goes! Plausable, enjoyable and a good read. Pick it up when you come across it or order it. Not a ""must have"", but absolutely worth your money."
2,Doesn't really work,"I picked this item up about a year ago to allow myself to quickly get my laptop up and running in my home office on my full size monitor/keyboard/mouse. When it works, it works great. However, as other reviews have indicated, it doesn't always work. In order to get it to switch over to my laptop, I have to turn my home computer on - if that isn't on, it won't flip to the laptop. Even when the laptop goes into sleep mode after it has been working, I often have to turn on my home computer yet again to get it to flip over.It does not work as designed in my case. If you have two computers that you keep on all the time, then this product will work great for you (when it works, it works perfectly) - if you have a laptop and don't keep your home computer on, then look elsewhere for a solution. I've lived with it, but it annoys me to no end."
5,Works Perfectly!,"After the trendnet that is so highly rated - but where do you put it? Cables coming out in all directions - it works great but is absolutely butt ugly - and the iogear miniview which looks great but only has hotkey switching and doesn't work with an apple keyboard, I bought the Belkin Flip. Worked perfectly right out of the box. Downloaded the hotkey software for my Windows XP desktop and for the Leopard MacBook I have hooked together and voila - the switch works, hitting the control key on my apple keyboard switches both ways! Way awesome. I suspect when any of these KVMs are compatible with everything you have they just work and when something is out of whack, they don't. Best to remove from and keep the packaging clean so you can return if you have to!"
5,It Works Fine!,"I finally broke down and bought a new computer. BUT, I'm not ready to buy all new programs for Windows7. So, I use my old (2002) XP computer, with my old PhotoImpact and PrintMaster programs, but have my new tower to go online, work on my Photo Albums/Web Sites/etc. I have no problems switching back and forth using the Belkin Flip!"
1,Pretty piece of garbage,"I just bought this switch a couple weeks ago, and have had trouble with it from the start. At first it seemed to work ok when I had my notebook and desktop hooked up to it, but I found when I remove my notebook it doesn't work at all. The button is a great idea, but it never works. When it does manage to switch between PCs either my mouse and keyboard stop working, or the audio does not transfer. Makes me question if I will buy Belkin products in the future."
4,Windows XP Pro and Windows Vista Business computers,"I have just set this up using 2 computers: one Win XP Pro and one Win Vista Business and although Vista wants to be first, it's working remarkably well for a low cost, low end solution. I simply wanted to share sound and keyboard only, so have not tested the monitor sharing, but was surprised this even worked at all and am very pleased."
1,Very Disappointed,"Belkin F1DG102U Flip 2-Port KVM Switch with Audio Support (USB Connection)This switch worked the day I installed it. At boot-up the next day it did not work on either computer. After many fruitless attempts, I finally got it to go by disconnecting and reconnecting the USB cable to my computer; however, the unit failed to work again at boot-up. It appears that the only way for me to get it going is to unplug and re-plug the cable to the USB port on my computer each and every time I boot up. I tried using three different USB ports on the computer but got the same result each time.I have the PS2 version of the same Belkin switch which works just fine all the time. I bought the USB version to use with a wireless USB keyboard/mouse. I switched back to the PS2 version and all works well now; however, I'm out 50-some dollars that I paid for the switch as well as the 120-some dollars that I paid for the USB wireless keyboard/mouse."
1,Not as advertised,"Very frustrating to install and try to get operational. I had good luck sometimes, then complete failure other times. I am returning. After installation it worked well, then I powered down the laptop. I could not get it to switch back to the desktop without powering the laptop up again. Just not ready for prime time."
2,Good design but has a few bugs,"I like the design of the Belkin Flip, but I experience some of the same issues that have already been covered in some previous reviews: (1) the connection with the remote switch needs to be ""just right"" in order for it to function (I usually have to press the plug into the unit really hard until the green/yellow light finally comes on), and (2) with my Mac/PC setup, it almost always fails to recognize the mouse & keyboard on the PC side (not trying to start a Mac vs. PC war, this is just the way it is). The video works fine & switches instantly between the two systems, and the Mac side always recognizes the keyboard/mouse right away. To compensate, and since both computers are fairly close together, I just swap the keyboard's USB plug between the front USB ports on both computers (with the mouse plugged into the USB port on the Mac keyboard)...not the greatest setup, but it works."
2,"Good idea, poor results","I have a laptop running Vista and a desktop running XP, and I use a Logitech wireless mouse/keyboard. This unit was extremely frustrating because one minute it would work perfectly, and the next I would zero response from the unit when pressing the button. Even more frustrating was the fact that it would switch without warning, and any time it switched there would be a significant delay before I could use my mouse or keyboard again (4-5 seconds). I replaced it with an iogear unit which works much better, but still seems to have issues with remembering the custom key settings. More on THAT in another review. :) I'd stay away from this belkin unless you really, really want to have a little wireless puck on your desk that doesn't work half the time."
4,"Classic SAC season 1 but, with one flaw.","I just bought this title (again) and it's really the way to go if you are into SAC. There is however a flaw with the set that has continued from the initial release of the limited edition disks. Specifiacally disk two. The limited edition releases came with two disks, a conventional disk and one coded for DTS. Volume two's disks were the only disks in the series that were silk screened in reverse so that the DTS disk was labled as if it were the standard version. This problem continues in this set. What this means is that a conventional DVD player will not give you any volume from the disk and you can tell on the main menu because it will read DTS disk in the right corner of the menu. Maybe Bandai will concede to replacing the erronious disk with one that will play on standard players but, I haven't gotten that far yet. That's the ONLY reason I can't give it a 5 star rating."
3,Not a sure buy,"This comes with 3 discs (1 B&W DVD, 1 color DVD, 1 music CD). A wonderful movie in the 40's, unfortunately the movie is racist in any scene with the black maid & her kids and beware of the musical number performed in ""black face"" - I guess it seemed funny in the 40's. George Clooney must have forgotten about this movie during his oscar acceptance speech. I think the movie is a good reminder of how people thought of blacks, including hollywood, before the civil-rights movement. Overall it is an good movie, I would just be careful showing it to children who may not be able interpret the racist scenes as a sad part of history."
5,Happy Times!,"I'd promised myself that this year I would not gush over the Holiday Season and remain as removed as possible from all the sentimentality associated with this time of the year.Sadly, I failed and once again sat back and enjoyed an hour or so watching this seasonal favorite.I do recommend this film for sentimentalists everywhere."
5,Holiday Inn Movie Review,great old movie...loved it ! I would recommend this movie to anyone who are fans of Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire. These two actors are great together!
4,"Nostalgic, warm, fun!","I love the music, dancing, and the fabulous talent. Bing Crosby croons ""White Christmas"" like no one else can. The love story is sweet, too."
2,Mind numbing,Soooooo glad they remade this! The best part was being able to see other angles of the White Christmas set.
2,Not Special Edition,"DVD advertised as ""Special Edition"" Got ""Holiday Inn/Going my way"" DVD. Not what I wanted but to late to return it is a gift. Shipping was very fast."
5,Christmas isn't Christmas without Holiday Inn...,"This has been a Christmas favorite for me and my family for so many years! We even watch it throughout the year. It ranks up there as one of my all time favorite movies. What I don't understand is the all the racism comments that have been attached to this movie. Mamie, the maid is actually treated well considering the time frame and her children are just sweet children in this movie. Too much is being made of the so-called racism in this movie, you just have to view the movie and remember it is 1942, not 1999. All of my nieces and nephews feel, ""It isn't Christmas until they have watched Holiday Inn!"" They are all under 22 years old, so that gives you an idea of the ageless appeal this wonderful old movie has. Buy it, rent it, just be sure to watch it and start your holidays off right!"
5,Must have to celebrate the Holiday season,Very nostalgic--Fred Astaire and Bing at theirbest. Great music and great dance routines.I fine this really helps get me into the HolidayMood.
5,A favorite Christmas memory,I've loved this film since I first saw it as a child. Astaire and Crosby are perfect here and as many times as I've seen this it never bores me for a second. How can anybody be bored by Bing singing White Christmas or Fred doing that 4th of July dance with the firecrackers. Just a fabulous film.
2,Just an OK movie,"Not really a Christmas movie, it's just OK. Bing is a bit older in the film; take it for what it's worth"
1,Holiday Inn is the worst customer support,"Holiday Inn express Amarillo West charged me $145 for a room which I didn't use. My wife called from the road late at night to check on room availability. Unfortunately she gave her Credit Card number to reserved the room and forgot to tell the representative that we had a dog. Big mistake, An hour later I went to check in and found that the dog was not allowed. I tried to cancel and was told the cancellation charge was the full room rate. The person at the desk was extremely rude and obnoxious and at that point I told him I would dispute it with my credit card company. He later told me we could have the dog in our room for $50 which would have made the room $195 for 6hours since it was 1:00AM and we would be leaving at 7:00AM I was so upset at that point I just left and found another room at a Best Western. I will never stay at a Holiday Inn again as long as I live."
3,ok,"If you like the concept of White Christmas and the classical musical genre, then you should like this. But it is not White Christmas. I thought Holiday Inn was ok,; my mom kinda hated it. I appreciate a 1940's musical, love these cast members but didn't like Holiday Inn. I love White Christmas and own it but Holiday Inn would be more worth a rental"
1,Dorman 425-176 Intermediate Steering Shaft,"This is of poor quality, lasted only 1200km before it started to clunk worse than the original. With in hours of driving the steering felt soft and then the dreaded clunk returned, because of the low quality the steering now clunks with every bump or turn on the road. I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Big Improvement,My steering response on my truck has improved alot since replacing this shaft. It was also was very easy to install.
5,PERFECT,I bought this part hoping it would correct the thumping in the steering of my 2004 Sierra. IT WORKED. Installed it myself six months ago and it has worked flawlessly
1,"Did not cure the ""popping.""","I purchased this item to replace the poorly designed stock unit that is making terrible popping/clunking noises in a 2005 Suburban. Prior to this, I replaced the steering column bearing to ensure that was not the problem. Much to my dismay, this part did not stop the noise. Actually, when I drive over speed bumps it makes a loud squeaking noise, presumably due to a lack of grease in the shaft. Although it is designed differently, it looks almost identical to the stock unit. I'm now contemplating whether I want to re-install the stock one and send this unit back. Not sure it's worth the $40 or not though, although Amazon is fantastic to work with. Borgeson makes a much beefier shaft for this application but I'm not sure I want to spend the extra $'s on this."
2,can't see controls,"With small black on black controls and a hard to open case, this unit is a disaster. Plays nice, but what good is that when you can't put in a CD or operate the controls?"
2,Where's the kid?!,"2 1/2 stars. Hated the whole thing about Allie's dad and Clay's mum; Allie's dad was just a real arse. Also wasn't a big fan of the fact that Allie's daughter was really annoying and spoiled and a nonexistent factor in their relationship, unlike Grace's story. Just okay;Dead Silence (The Stillwater Trilogy, Book 1)was the best and most satisfying--stick with that one and leave this one andDead Right (The Stillwater Trilogy, Book 3)alone."
5,Dead Giveaway Brenda Novak Book,This series was fantastic bought the whole lot and just kept reading. Love them sorry the series had ended. Thank you.
1,"""couldn't put it down"" (or pick it up)","I'm sorry to say, this is a sad representation on your part Tony. The release date for this book has been bumped again and again for a long time now, with no book in sight. For such a well-liked motivational speaker, you leave a lot to be desired. Oh well, you've made your money--right? Like all of you other reviewers of make believe books, I agree, this is Robbins best to date. It's just too bad that such a great motivator of others can't get off his but, quit shoulding over himself, and write his book. A great many fans are becoming disappointed. Come on Tony, you can do it. Write, edit, and publish your book. I, for one, hope you're ashamed of yourself. But, as I stated earlier, You've made your money, so piss on your followers. I really do hope you read this review Tony. I'm sure I'm not your only reader/listener/watcher disappointed in your performance. Prove me wrong. Send me anger mail--whatever. Just write your book!"
1,"""Sad""","This is a ""How To"" book. It should be titled How to fail as an author. Yes, I am slightly upset that Anthony Robbins, a self-proclaimed motivational ""expert"" is so lackadaisical about his own image, when it comes to delivering the product. I, for one, boycott your future products. Thanks for nothing."
4,Pretty good taste,As far as powders go this one is pretty tasty. I just mix with water but the trick is to use REALLY cold water and shake quite well. It's much more tasty if the water is really cold.
3,not bad...,"This is the first time to try protein shakes. Strawberry banana is not bad, but not great. Can't wait to try the other flavors.I can't comment on Whey protein versus the other and dissolving is not an issue when mixing. I am quite content with my purchase."
2,Good songs but the vocals?,"I found the musicians on the recording to be quite good and the lyrics to the songs are extremely funny. However, the singer seems someone more accustomed to opera or madrigals then to bawdy songs. She is a wonderful singer, but seems ill-suited to this type of music. I find the combination of her voice with these lyrics to be un unpleasant one. I am unable to listen to more the 2 or 3 songs at a time unless I am putting it on as purely background music and ignore the lyrics completely, and since the purpose of a CD of ""bawdy"" songs is usually the humorous lyrics, I found this recording to be a bit of a waste."
5,Suzanne does it again!,"When I read *Bodyguard*, I thought Suzanne had reached the pinnacle of success - that the remainder of her books might be *as good*, but would never surpass it. Boy, was I wrong. I started reading *The Unsung Hero*, and was immediately sucked into the story... so much so that I stayed up until about 3:30 a.m. (hey, don't mention that to the dh, please!) in order to finish the last exciting word. I know that some readers disliked the WWII tie-in, but as the daughter of a WWII vet, I lapped up every bit of it. And the ending! Oh my WORD! I shan't spoil it for you, but that was just possibly one of the most powerful denouements I've ever read. All I can say now to Suzanne Brockmann is, ""Do it again! Please, do it again!"""
1,The Reader is the Unsung Hero,"If you make it through this book, you will be the unsung hero. The plot was simple and the characters were one dimensional. After seeing the book cover I thought this would be a book about the military...but it was about reunions and relationships. I found the book written at the high school level."
5,Very nice,"Very good read. First time for this author, and will buy anything she writes. Instant service from Kindle, as always."
3,This book was good...but not great!,"I have read almost every book Suzanne Brockmann has written. I have loved everyone of them. I do have my favorites, and unfortunately Unsung Hero is at the bottom of my list. My reasons: The central story about Tom and Kelly was wonderful. Even the secondary characters were interesting. However, the World War II flashbacks were not needed. There was enough going on in the book without having to relive Tom's Uncle, and Kelly's fathers flashbacks repeatedly. It interrupted the flow of the book. It took me out of the story and I had to actually put the book down because of boredom. I finally started skipping over those parts. A sure sign that the writer has lost me. Overall I would give this book a C+. I would actually love to see a book about the other two secondary characters, David and Mallory. Now that could be a great story."
3,Could of been better...,What made this story a little different from others was that the author let us into the heads of the characters and the internal discussion was what a lot of people say to themselves. Made it easy to relate to the characters. The big problem was the weak relationship was between your lead characters and that was a shame. All and all the book was enjoyable and was easy to finish but it wasn't the best.
1,Good grief!,"I thought this would be an action book my husband and I could listen to on a road trip. It started off with a great premise, but quickly got sidetracked by a not-so-softcore porn story. The spies were so secondary to the story that, although we almost felt obligated to finish it, we quit listening about 3/4 of the way through. We just didn't care anymore."
5,It's a must,"After having read many books about law, whether common law or any form of law, this book tops them all. It goes straight to the origins of Justice on earth and doesn't try to please anybody: it explains the truth. Strongly recommended for anybody who wants to study law. For every Christian, it's a must!"
5,Like them more then I expected...,"I'd done some basic research prior to settling on the Pentax 8x25. Having read a number of favorable reviews, I decided that I would fork out the $$$ (note - Amazon's MSRP is much higher than the actual MSRP - not sure where the error occured - but these have an MSRP of $105). I received the binoculars yesterday, I am very pleased with them. One feature of interest that is absent from the descriptions is that the binoculars have a place where you can mount a tripod to them - this is not a feature found on all compact binoculars so I'm suprised I didn't see it mentioned. The close focus is quite good, I'm easily able to focus as close as 6-7 feet. The overall build quality seems solid. The eye pieces extend back and so can accomodate both those with and without glasses. One downside is that they eyepiece lens covers will definitely be easy to use. Overall I would say that these binoculars have exceeded my expectations."
5,Wow!,"Morricone's music is intelligent, appropriate to the themes and unforgettable. We play it over and over and never get tired of it."
2,Where's the movie?,"I have bought a handful of movie music in my life. The Piano. Mishima. Great stuff, if you have the moving pictures to go along with them. So, the fault must be with me, and not Morricone."
5,Best consumed in small doses,"When I was a lot younger (like, 40 years ago) Fredric Brown was one of my favorite authors. I read all five of his SF novels, quite a few of his mysteries, and most of his SF shorts. The latter are what make up this book. And while I have enjoyed reading (actually, for the most part, re-reading) these little gems, I have to say that they're more enjoyable taken two or three at a time than read in one continuous batch. Certain themes (time travel, mind control, narrowly-averted alien conquests, awesome powers gone awry) crop up again and again. An extraordinary number of his protagonists are alcoholics, or at least drunk. And his depiction of man/woman relationships is often leering. Still, most of these stories are fun, thought-provoking, or in some instances (e.g. Hat Trick) downright scary. I hesitate to give this book five stars; it's really more of a high four-star entry. But I'll give it the full five just because Brown's writing gave me so much pleasure, long ago!"
3,Sorry Robin!!!,This just did not compare to HeartMate. I really did not feel the love connection between to the two characters. The Fams were tedious. Maybe the next one will be better.
3,Not as good as the first,The story wasn't as good as the first. The characters were flat. The uncle is just pure evil. You aren't given any background on him-just statements about the evil things he does. Also the relationship between the two main characters isn't well developed. The two seem to just fall in love at first sight. I wish Owens would have developed the characters and their relationships more. I thought the heroine took a lot of chances for a man she just meet.
1,CD - poor quality,"CD was played 1 time after several attempts to do so. No sound generated sinc then. I really thinK I am entitled to a refund on this purchased and as well as the 2nd CD purchased at the same involving the same performers. In fact, because the experience with this CD, I have not opened the 2nd one."
3,Missing key ingredient,"I'm all ready taking a Pharm Tech course, so this was supplemental for me. It has very good info except for one thing. There are no answers to the questions. So when I take the chapter reviews there is no way for me to know whether I've got the right understanding or not. An instructor's manual is required and can only be obtained if you are an instructor.And this instructor's manual does have the answer key. I would rate the book with 5 stars if I could grade my progress. Probably it would be no problem if you wanted to review, however, to use it as a stand-alone study guide, it is wanting."
1,Another recipient of a nasty collection notice,"We used to receive this magazine but let the subscription lapse last year. Today, nine months later, we received a notice form ""North Shore Agency- A National Collection Agency"" with ""ACCOUNT STATUS: DELINQUENT"" all bordered in red and official looking. Called Kid's Discover (800.825.2821) and were told that we'd authorized two additional years but hadn't paid. It took over an hour, several phone calls, checking our facts with old bank statements, etc. before confirming they'd just signed us up for two additional years without our permission and then sent us the delinquent notice. This is a crooked business."
1,Piece of junk,"Like some of the other reviewers, worked great until a few months later and now the DVD's just spin with the loading icon displayed. A total and complete waste of money."
4,Really good for the price,"I'm surprised that so many people have had trouble with theirs; ours lasted five years before having its first problem and considering its been used by kids hands (i.e. mildly sticky hands) for the past three of those years, I'm surprised it has held up so well. We ran into our first problem today which my husband was able to fix, thankfully, but out of curiosity I thought I would check online to see how much they cost these days (We received ours as a gift, but its still good to know in case you ever need to replace one) and was surprised to see such negative reviews.So here's one positive review: It does what you want it to (see: play movies for your kids on long car trips) and in our case, lasts at least five years. Controls are easy enough for a child to use and brightness is easily adjusted."
2,Had to return it,Seems like it is getting tougher all the time to find a cordless phone that works really well. I own another panasonic so I felt confident this one would be ok. But I kept getting complaints from people I called that I sounded distant or like I was inside a barrel. Then there were clicks and I was told I kept breaking up. The final problem was the design of the handset... somehow just couldn't get a comfortable fit with my ear. Seems like they design phones without even considering that someone has to hold the thing against an ear for what may be long periods of time. So had to return it and try another.
1,It's a turd,"Like every one else says, it won't hold a charge at all. It also has problems answering while it's ringing. Additionally calls are filled with static when near a microwave."
5,"Solid, well-built","I'm not a big woodworker, but from my general uses...this jig was very strongly built and worked well. I'd recommend removing ""tailing"" every couple holes and not going right down a board as they will pack and build up under the jig...but this is probably common with all of them."
3,"Very mechanically written, but worth a look!","This subject is an important one to explore, but there must be a more interesting way to do it. The book is primarily a quantitative study that must have been the author's master's thesis. Names are transcribed from census records, and the difficulties in quantifying black slaveowners is explored. However, the author does nothing to take the reader beyond documented fact. Readers looking for a poignant journey should look elsewhere."
4,sisters to the owl?,some of the chaotic parts of this cd make me think of trevor dunn's trio-convulsant... i prefer these guys though... but i almost always choose the underdog... obscure music is our friend.. and i only give them 4 stars cause no one gets 5 just my philosophy ;)
4,A magical movie for moms and kids alike -,"Based on the popular children's short story ""The Mommy Market,"" the story centers around the three Martin children: Elizabeth (Anna Chlumsky), Jeremy (Aaron Metchik) and Harry (Asher Metchik), who are unhappy with their single mother (Sissy Spacek). Their elderly friend, Mrs. Cavour (Maureen Stapleton), tells them of an ancient magical spell that will allow them to go to the Mommy Market to select a new mother. Through the course of the film they try out 3 different mothers - but none of them is to their liking, either. They all sound good at the start, but experience shows that even the coolest Mom can have some of the strangest drawbacks..."
3,Smelly,"I like the essence of a fire in my fireplace and all is well until there is only 1/2"" of fuel in the bottom of the can, then the whole place smells like burnt fuel and we then need to open the windows to air out the house. What's the sense of that, I have to set a timer when we burn so that we don't get to the bottom.Nice to have the fire, sad we have to monitor it this way."
1,NOT CLEARPLAY,"Ignore the other reviews, this unit does not have clearplay. It's just a less than ordinary, somewhat overpriced for what it is DVD player. You must now order Clearplay DVD players from clearplay directly."
2,"Interesting, BUT a bit naive!","For a longer and more plausible theory, be sure to read Oh, No.....Jackie_O! by January JOnes published in May, 1998, (available through amazon.com) which realistically implicates Jackie with Onassis right from the very beginning rather than after the fact. No one, not even Onassis, would order a hit on the President of the United States without knowing that his reward would be the Widow Kennedy. This was a murder for a marriage without a doubt."
5,Beautiful,"Very enjoyable movie. Lovely cinematography, heartfelt love story. Characters very sympatico.Great music, some of the best from Salim-Suliman. :)"
5,Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi,"First: Ignore the summary on the back of the dvd. I don't know if it is a poor translation or what, but it really isn't descriptive of the type of movie this is....it makes it sounds very teenage, romantic comedy, cheesey etc. It is a good story line, romantinc but without a lot of the physical intimacy that pervades so many movies."
4,nice shirt,"I enjoy this shirt because, well, I needed a new t-shirt to support my team. I am rating this a 4/5 because of the size. I ordered a large, because I wear a M/L in adult t-shirts. Unfortunately, the item doesn't specify that this must clearly be MENS sizing, rather than the normal adult...unless I've shedded some massive weight, which in that case, I'd like to see it more. Anyways, this shirt is great, but the sizing is bigger than I had expected. Now, I'm swimming in my Seahawks t-shirt. Oh well, more room to eat snacks while watching the game!!! Good ol' shirt."
4,ballydowse,"ballydowse is a wonderful eclectic celtic band and this cd is a terrific listen. pipes and guitars, drums and fiddle and the digerydo (sp?) all combined for classic slightly punk celtic rock. most enjoyable."
4,Works Great But Needs Lot of Open Space,"I bought this product for my almost-seven-year-old grandson for Christmas. His mother reports that the thing works great -- really takes off and flies loops and dips and soars just like he was hoping. However, be forewarned: it requires lots of wide open space because you have no control over it once it's launched. He spent Christmas in Hawaii where the flyer got caught in the top of a palm tree on one of its early flights. They had to call someone in to retrieve it. So consider whether you have a big open field somewhere nearby before you buy this product. If you do, it's a wonderful toy."
2,Maybe it is a terrible translation?,"I just bought Torso after finishing (in the last couple years) all of Nesbo's Harry Hole books (Norway), all of Mankell's Wallander books (Sweden), all of the Erlandur/Iceland books, several of Camilla Lackberg's books, and a smattering of other Scandinavian fiction. I was looking forward to a women detective. But I thought this book was so awkwardly written in the English language version, and the ending was abrupt and disappointing. I wonder if it is the translation, because the dialogue is so choppy and awkward, as is the expository writing. I also found it devoid of truly suspenseful moments as the plot thickened. (For example, when they finally realize who the killer is is such an underwhelming scene.)I am really surprised there are so many positive reviews!I may try another before I completely rule this author out, but this was a real letdown."
3,"Great shots, but camera fell apart","I bought this camera - it has great features - great zoom, great self-timer and takes crystal clear pictures, but the film is hard to load and on the one I had, the autorewind icon would not turn off. After using the camera for just a week, I went to take a look at the battery and the bottom part of the battery chamber fell off. I returned it."
5,"emotional, ethereal, enigmatic","In Love & Light is a gorgeous work of art. a collaboration of endless talent painting their soundscapes with a wonderful diversity of instrumentation and vocals and language. charcoal love, so simple, and yet beautiful, is a perfect introduction to music that will touch and inspire you. as you progress you will be treated to dream like vocalization in the same vein as This Mortal Coil, Cocteau Twins, Stina Nordenstam, only even more timeless. i am deeply in love with this music."
5,Gossip Girl rules,You have gotta love this book. Cecily von Ziegesar is my new favorite author. You can't help connecting with the characters and caring about what happens to them. Everyone should read this book.
4,Hey can you guys help me please,I am looking at buying summerslam 2002 or survivor series 2003 can you guys tell me the extrtas that are on survivor series and which one you think is better?thanks
2,Good...But Bad For a Summerslam,"There were a few good matches on here, but I didnt find it that good. Summerslams 2000, 2001, and 2002 beat this by a longshot!"
3,"Good, But Not Great","This is a good pack of games for someone who doesn't necessarily play a lot of computer-type games. It keeps you entertained, but it is not always the most technologically advanced. Of course, you can only expect so much from a game for a PDA OS.The slots have a good selection, but I don't much care for the old-style slots. The best game I have played thus yet has to be Blackjack. However, it has a nasty habit of giving you a bunch of bad deals in a row so you lose all the money you just built up. The video poker is questionable. It is hard to see the ""red"" cards sometimes because of the contrast in grayscale. It doesn't let you win alot, either.I bought these games to practice incase I make a trip to the casino. They're good basic games, but I doubt most people would use all of them. I don't know if it's worth the price, but that's for you to decide."
1,"Bad seller, Don't buy from them","They such a bad seller,I bought one book from them and they give another one ,because students are busy so I haven't return it on time.At the begining of next quarter I sell back to them with another book.They promise me for 20s for total, but after I sent to them, they E-mail me and tell me I just can get $1.22 for two books.I am very angry!The package costed me 99 sents.They only give me back 1.22,I just get 1.22-0.99=0.23!!.Just like I drived over 2 mile to the post office and give the book to someone for free."
5,This Book Was One of the Pioneers on the Subject - But Still Has Many Useful Ideas,"Stephen's book is one of the pioneer books on this subject, but still has many applicable tools and tips. I purchased my copy about a week before my book went into publication, but did not get a chance to read it until recently. The number of similar topics covered was a surprise. The content and ideas in this book are applicable to many things besides online bookselling. I am happy and encouraged to see that the sales of this book are still brisk and while some parts of it are dated in this fast changing business, even the dated ones still have value to someone getting into the online bookselling business.This book is a very good reference for even the experienced online bookseller with ideas ranging from the efficient use of time to how to get more books quickly and cheap by using advertising.I wish you the best in the sales of your book Stephen and success to all that buy it."
4,e book - how to sell used books,Very helpful in setting up the used book program for our library. Information was easy to dig through and apply.
5,Valuable Advice,"Book is exactly as title describes it...complete. Very useful. Very helpful. Author writes clearly and precisely. If you wish to sell books online, this is a ""must have""."
4,An exercise in academic technique,"Martin Duberman's About Time is a fascinating core sample of America's approach to not just homosexuality, but its own ethical codes as well. However, if you are looking for relaxing affirmation of our society's progress, this is not necessarily the right place to find it: Duberman makes it painstakingly clear throughout his notes and essays that even those who proclaim themselves allies of the gay liberation movement can hinder the cause through mainstream pandering and shoddy argumentation. The second half of the book, made up entirely of Duberman's own essays, presents a kind of shocking exposé of the flaws in so-called ""academic"" approaches to both hard and human sciences. No matter your field, I would highly recommend this book to anyone working in an academic capacity, if only to keep you on your intellectual toes, for nobody escapes Duberman's sharp and mostly warranted criticism."
2,This Product is Pretty...,I purchased this product and installed it on a Color Palm OS machine. The Games are very generic with no customizable features. The program options are: New (game); Pick Game; Send Cards (autoplay cards playble to foundations); and Stats (statistics). The games are playable but there is no undo option(that I can find). The program does provide rules on how to play each game. My suggestion: Save your money and buy the Acid series.

5,Tons of fun compared to other battery ride ons,"Our grandson won't leave it alone for 10 minutes. Parks it in the garage next to Dad's motorcycle and can't get enough of it.If you can find one buy it. We had to look all over to find one.All the neighbor kids love it. He's crashed it ten times and it still looks like new. More than I can say for bikes costing $10,000. Ha Ha."
4,Pretty Good,This jacket is basicaly pretty good. My only gripe is that the belt clip hangs up on the enclosure seal when you rotate it. So I have to use 2 hands to spin it.
1,Worst ever,"The hero just happens to be in the right place at the right time with the right people once to many times for my taste. After the first few times this happened, I lost interest in the book and its stretch of a story."
1,Where were the continuity police?,"The previous reviews are completely on point...the references to 9/11 and having the protaganist pay all his bills with wads of euros did not help update the story a bit. Did an editor even pretend to look at it? Aside from the anachronisms and inconsistencies, it is a poor book...left in its own time period of the 1980s, it would have been simply awful...cartoonish, one-dimensional characters, undeveloped plot line. Not even worth it as a beach read."
2,Not much of a read,"I purchased this book in an airport. Had heard something about ""Da Vinci Code"", maybe I was confused with the title. Got about half way through this book before I finally said enough. A poorly written book with non-sensical turns in the plot development. For instance, a female reporter shows up to help the central character in Europe. She saves his life because she is packing a pistol and happens to be a crack shot. Even in 1983 it was not likely anyone packed a pistol in Europe. She could not have brought it from the states and almost impossible to purchase one in Europe. Well, the book goes on and on like that."
5,"Excellent Book, Tight and Suspenseful","The Da Vinci Legacy has everything I look for in a religious thriller:* An ancient secret brotherhood.* A devastating new weapon of destruction.* An unthinkable targetI liked the book, I liked Daughter of God too.I did enjoy the way Perdue develops his characters and the teriffic techniques he uses to weave historical facts into the story. Perdue is an excellent novelist. He knows how to create tension, gradually introduce details all while saving the big surprise for the end.But I had a real nagging ""been there read that"" feeling, maybe from having first read Code."
2,DaVinci'sLegacy,"I thought this book had great shoot out scenes and great escape scenes but little else. The reader doen't get to the ""heart of the Matter""until page 200, after way too much blood has been spilled. This book was first published in 1985,yet contains references to 9/11. I think Leonardo would flip in his grave if he thought this much death and destruction was his legacy."
1,Poor quality/B movie,"The movie has a poor story line, the acting is cheesy, and the plot is completely predictable. It is hard to find reviews about this movie and I got stuck with a case that'll hold another movie and a low quality frisbee."
2,Call it Chick Lite,"Calling ""The Ex Factor"" the Chinese food of Chick Lit is a grave disservice to the cuisine of the Middle Kingdom. Semple's not a bad writer and her sex scenes are quite spicy, but the novel will stay with you only as long as it takes to close the book and put it back on a shelf. None of the characters is remotely believable or likeable, and a bizarre domestic violence interlude just leaves you queasy. ""Ex Factor"" would be better described, perhaps, as the Yoshinoya of Japanese food--cheap, greasy and a bit stomach-turning."
5,THE BEST,"the best book I've read, I think everything is there,read that book but it is very easy on the Kindle that I can carry around"
5,amazing.,"this product has very many uses. i personally dont use it to guard documents, but as a coaster, a mousepad, and last but not least, i pick-guard for my guitar. its waterproof and durable. look at the price. if you dont buy it, youre crazy."
2,Not a favorite.,"We bought this before going on a 16 hour car trip with our kids (19 mo & 3 1/2 yrs). It did not really work all that well. We were hoping that they could use it to play matchbox cars or polly pocket on but it was too squishy for the cars and too small of a surface area for polly. It did work ok for putting snacks on for our older one, but the little guy had a hard time with it. We found that the top of the Rubbermaid box which we had packed their toys in made a better tray than this one."
2,"Kind of bulky, clasps don't work well",This tray seems like it'd be a great idea but there are a few problems. 1. It's bulky so it's hard to find a place to keep it when you're not using it. This can cause a huge problem if your car is already packed tight. 2. The clasps don't work that great so it's hard to get it to stay attached to the carseat. It works ok for older kids but the little ones have a hard time if it won't stay clasped.
1,Very basic stuff,"A very thin ""book"".You know - let's just call it a pamphlet. A pamphlet containing the very same information you could gather with your favorite search engine. This is NOT helpful if you're looking for a real intro to sporting wagering and odds-making. It could be a good example, however, of the type of thing you could distribute if you were seeking to make some easy bucks self-publishing."
4,A gem,"524 pages to hold you in a Fetterlock. A wonderful story, well researched and well written.enjoyable."
1,Waste of Time,This was really bad. Dr. Blair tries to teach you French by putting you in an adventure story. I got this on sale for a few dollars and it wasn't even worth that. If you want to learn French using the auditory method then use Pimsleur or Michel Thomas which are so much better than this product
5,Awesome for someone whose a kid at heart who wants everything. . .,"I LOVE this phone. I got the Razr and didn't like it. . . so I was frustrated and like ""just let me buy that little phone"" while speaking to cingular. WELL, This is such a rad weird phone. The graphics are so fun and almost . . . french weird or something, there is a Clown that pops up when you want to take a picture. The online stuff works perfect, texting, downloading games, tones, etc. I love this phone. It's like super ""japan"" cute animation phone for the kid at heart. . . and I'm sure any teen would like it. I lOVE IT. It's my favorite I've ever had, granted I am very young at heartt. ;) It is a lil power house."
5,Love Joe Dirt,"The music on this CD is great. I get bored with CDs by one artist, and with this, you get good old rock and roll by many different groups. I am a very young 50 and think if you grew up when I did, you will love it."
4,M. Mitchell's Question,"The title of the song playing when Brandi rides up on the horse is ""when I'm with you"", by Sheriff"
3,(...),I Love the movie Joe Dirt. I think spade does a terrific work as the character Joe Dirt. After watching it over and over again. I got really intrested in buying the soundtrack. And so i did. And i put it on and listen to the tracks. Very Good songs.. (...)Many thanks fromMicke
3,"Hmm, I don't think it's complete...","First of all, the songs ON the cd are excellent songs, for the most part. (i don't know about all that eddie money stuff though.) I think the movie could have (should have) had better songs to represent Joe Dirt. MORE Skynyrd and Southern Rock bands like The Allman Brothers, ZZ Top, Marshall Tucker Band, etc. would have been better. I think that song at the very end of the movie when Joe Dirt and the gang are riding off into the sunset should have been included as well, Funk 49 by James and The Gang.But, all in all, it is a decent soundtrack."
1,Only buy this if you need a set of speakers.,"This DVD player is very sensitive to whether or not the disk is clean. Many DVDs that I have will not play on this player, but will play on my other devices without problem.Also, the DVD player has no way to access the menus if you happen to lose the remote."
3,can you connect this to a hub,Why can't someone state definitely that this can be connected to a hub to bridge multiple devices simultaneously
1,if there was only a 0-star rating,"DO NOT BUY THIS! I am a proud owner of several good products from dlink. I am a not so proud owner of 3 bad 810+'s. The first one configured fine. I decided to upgrade the firmware on it, and it crahed, not taking any firmware. OK every once in a while you get a bad one, so I returned it for a second one. That one crashed when trying to apply my wep key. It wouldn't take any firmware after a reset. Begrudgingly I recieved a third one. Again, while entering my wep key it crashed and wouldn't take firmware. I spoke to level 1 and 2 tech support from dlink. They then passed me on to an engineer in their engineering dept. Nobody could explain why this kept crashing. User error was eliminated, I work in IT and this is an easy piece to configure, far from my first. Other bad hardware on my side was elininated because the third one was configured on a different pc, different cat 5 different nic, etc. It is a bad piece of equipment and I will be getting a linksys very soon."
5,A hilarious book that's a ton of fun to read!,"Jessica loves computer games. Especially violent ones. For a while now, she's been trying to beat Gopher, a game where the player has to defeat mutant gophers with an arsenal of various deadly weapons. She's so sick of Gopher that when her friend Matt offers to meet her on a cool new game site, Go4, she readily agrees. But Jess and Matt are in for the shock of their lives. Because when they play Go4, they find themselves transported to a virtual reality world. In this wacky world, anything goes, including using a credit card without paying and riding on a centaur with the attitude of a surfer dude. But it's not just all fun and games. Because an evil villain wants to take over the world, and only Jess and Matt can stop him. I highly reccomend this book to anyone who's looking for a good laugh."
1,450 or 500?,"I just bought this system, and the label on it says 70x5 and 100w sub...which makes sense as this adds to 450watts (as does the model number indicate).....Why is it that everyone thinks this is a 500watt system? Is there another DAV-C450 that has 500watts or am I being daft!Will check my documentation when I unpack it at home"
2,Could be Better,"I purchased this system because of my prior excellent experience with Sony products. I was also influenced by the fact that, unlike Bose systems, proprietary wiring is not required. I had the speakers installed by an experienced electronics technician, and the system initially worked well. I commend the sound quality, but the volume/power needs to be stronger for some DVD/CD selections. After viewing about 12 DVD movies, the sound stopped working entirely, and this was just after the warranty ended. It had no sound for the receiver, DVDs, or CDs. I contacted Sony, and the cost of repair is $[money] For a $[money] system, this seems excessive. I'm still comtemplating these repair costs, but it may be necessary to avoid a [money] debacle. I'm definately taking another look at Sony quality."
1,"Take it Back, And go to Best Buy","After recieving this system for my birthday I was expecting it to hold up a lot better than my pioneer home theater, but was sadly mistaken. After a week I managed to blow out the two front channels and the sudwoofer. I took it back to recieve another hoping it was a defect. But it wasn't, soon enough I had blown out the same speakers again. While I still could I took the system back and got my money back. After I recieved my money I went looking for a better system. Best Buy is where I found it. fifty dollers more same wattage and no blowing out. Thank God."
4,Nice mold,"I like the half circle shape, however I have a bit of an issue with trailing hard candy between the shapes. Also, I cracked it the second time scrubbing it by accidentally twisting it - definitely not a ""snap away"" candy mold."
4,Mistake,"As the other reviewer said, this case is not 3"" - that is a mistake. Correct dimensions can be found on Vanguard's website. This case is the same height as the Designer 81 model (2.375""), and the same width and length as the Designer 83 (18"" x 13""). The Designer 83 is 3"" high. Note these are all outer dimensions.Seems like a lot of websites make this mistake, and I learned the hard way.However, these Vanguard Designer cases are very nice, and I recommend them if you can get the right fit."
5,On second pair,These shoes are very supportive and have significantly reduced my husband's pain from platar faciitis due to the cushioned sole. He is on his second pair and swears by them.
4,Crossworlds,Crossworlds!It was exciting to watch! I like movies like this one! Great actors! This movie was a great science fiction movie!
3,Brings home the bacon,"For a B-movie, this was not bad over all. The story was engaging and not total hollywood shlok. While it was no Star trek or 5th element, it was one of the better low buget sci-fi movies. This was more of a B+ movie then just a B-movie. A little bigger buget and maybe this could have gone some where...who knows. Over all I think this is a fun film, and you should give it a try."
2,Urgh.,"A bit like an episode of night rider. There's less plot here than a Xena episode, but it's fun and there are a couple of fight scenes. It looks like the writer didn't think about the premise much, since there is next to no explanation (beyond what you see in the blurb on the back of the case)."
1,Terrible waste of Talent,"This was a stupid concept; with the exception of a couple of good scenes, it was just a mish-mash of desert backdrops. Total waste of Rutger Hauer."
5,African Hunting Program,"This is a good program for that ""hunter"" who wants to experience the thrill of the hunt from the comfort of home."
3,bought game for my son,"I bought this game for my son, he has the other Dangerous Hunts games and enjoyes them. So I can't really review it."
1,SMELLS LIKE A$$,"OMG! My husband LOVES these, and I hate them with all my heart, I make him eat them outside, they smell horrible!!! I dont understand after smelling them you would WANT to put them in your mouth. lol But while he was in IRAQ I did order them by the box load on amazon (cheaper here then in stores) and sent them over to him."
4,FineReader 5.0 .. best thing since sliced bread for OCR,"Abbyy FineReader 5.0 is a great product beating the likes of OmniPage 6, and even more miserable TextBridge hands down (God, why does Epson package this miserable excuse for software with its scanners?). Well worth the money. There's a bit of a learning curve, but nothing too difficult to get the hang of."
4,Unique,"I consider this novel to be well-written. The plot is exceptionally original.The novel revolves around characters who have been so wounded and so traumized they are unable to truly communicate and connect with one another.Some well kept secrets began to unravel, and lives began to change, following the night the main character, Lowe, a Chinese man's small shop is burned down and with it the death of a mysterious man named Cecil."
1,VERY BAD SACD REMASTER OF A TRUE CLASSIC..,"I MUST AGREE WITH JAMES CROAK THIS IS THE WORST I HAVE HEARD. I MUST SAY IT SOUNDS SO BAD IT IS TIED WITH BOB DYLANS ""BLOOD ON THE TRACKS"" THAT WAS ALSO RUINED WHEN THEY PUT IT ON CD, AT LEAST BLOOD ON THE TRACKS DID NOT COST THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS ASKED FOR THIS PIECE OF JUNK.I TRIED 2 DIFFERENT SACD PLAYERS BEFORE I REALIZED IT WAS THE CD ITSELF.I THINK IT IS ALSO ON DVD AUDIO OR DTS CD. I HOPE THEY DID BETTER THAN THIS."
3,Santana Abraxas SACD,"Does anyone else notice or have a problem with about 5-10 seconds cut off the beginning of Hope You Are Feeling Better on the SACD version of this album, on the CD remaster it is fine????"
5,Awesome album,"Joel Plaskett cleaned up at the East Coast Music Awards for a reason. This album is amazing, check it out. Don't sleep!"
5,It's really pretty simple...,"Billy Collins' poetry is fun.What makes Collins' poetry stand above others' poetry? Collins makes profound observations without a moment of pretension. His poetry is accessible and written with the assumption that poetry should be read and enjoyed by all kinds of people, not just academics and students."
4,"Popular, entertaining poetry","Several of the more literary people I know look down on Billy Collins' poetry because it isn't challenging and he normally sticks to a light, comedic voice -- basically he is a mass market poet, which is strange in that field. Those are the reasons I enjoy his work: he doesn't take himself or the art too seriously, his poems are understandable and often make me laugh out loud. If you are looking for the cutting (bleeding?) edge of modern American poetry then look elsewhere. If you want smart, funny and entertaining poetry then buy, and enjoy, this book."
5,If I Could Write Poetry...,"...I would write like Billy Collins. Unfortunately, I can't, and there aren't many others who can either. Collins is just as good as he is supposed to be. His poems are wry glimpses at the seemingly mundane world around him, and through his poetry, he locates the humor and the wisdom and the beauty to be found therein. His poems are in turn witty and shocking and poignant. As the back of the cover says, he ""begins with the everyday and ends in the infinite."" That's just about right. He's got that same gift that poets like Emily Dickinson (the subject of one of his best poems) and Robert Frost had. He can look at the everyday and see the sublime."
1,Poor performer,"This little D-link box is reasonably simple to configure and use. Even using fast broadband service at both ends, audio quality was rather poor (I suspect the microphone is not very good) and the video was awful mainly because of the camera's extremely poor quality. I wonder what possessed D-Link to fit such a device with a camera that's about the same level of quality as a $15 USB webcam. Under ordinary interior lighting conditions, it is impossible to get a clear, naturally colored picture: all you will get is a noisy, muddy mess. Of course the lens quality matches the image sensor: it's awful.This is a real shame, because D-Link almost made a pretty good product here. The user interface and configuration are reasonably simple and well explained in the manual, and the performance passable. Unfortunately, the built-in microphone and camera are so bad they make an otherwise fairly decent product unusable."
4,Good bargain for a geek,"It works great for me. I am an IT person so it's not really hard for me to figure it out. But my feeling it's really a challenge to average consumer. That's maybe why such a good deal is not popular in retail stores. To make it work without too much hassle, just put it into the DMZ zone of your router. One suggestion: use it with a cordless phone will really improve the call experience.Things I don't like (D-Link guys can improve if they want to): the default lens, which has a narrow field of view, is not good for viewing kids, they run around the house. I ended up buying another wide-angle lens for $40. If a video-in jack can be added to connect external video source, such as a camcorder, that will be even better. The voice is not prioritized over video. So voice degrades as much as video when doing cross-Pacific netmeeting. That hurts. But what can you complaint about, a picture is worth a thousand words, let alone a video."
3,Quiet but inaccurate,"This humidifier has one great feature: it is very quiet.Pros: QuietCons: Very hard to hold the water tank when filling, shape is really awkward and imbalanced in this position (upside-down). The humidistat is completely inaccurate, I have a highly accurate certified hygrometer and this humidistat cannot tell the difference between 45 and 72% humidity (a huge difference in how a room feels. Basically, you get it started by adjusting the dial: it never stops! I don't know if it would keep running when the humidity is well over 70% because I've never let it go that far (feels like a swamp). If you live in a dry area as I do, and you know you want it on most of the time, its not too bad."
4,Nice unit for the price.,Pretty quite and does a nice job of treating the air with sufficient moisture. Would definitely consider buying it again.
4,Great Product,This is a good product. The only concern I have is filling the product everyother day. But I wouldn't trade for anything.
2,Have another but this model did not last long,"I have a larger model which has been operating perfectly for many months. This model stopped working after 2 weeks. Unfortunately, it was a bad time for me and I was unaware of Amazon's stellar return policy or rather, unable to take advantage of it due to being out of town for family matters. Love the larger capacity model which I also got from Amazon and paid under $60 for."
2,"Cool Moisture is nice, but otherwise I don't recommend it","I've owned this product for over a year, and I have to concur with some of the other reviewers. Even when I change the filter to a fresh one, the air that it emits has a moldy that I can get rid of (i.e., you can't clean the fan, at least very easily).You do need to fill the machine at least once a day too, and the design of the water carrier is silly (i.e., it won't hold upright on its own when you are filling it). Still on the search for a good humidifier!"
3,Pretty Good Product,"It is really great at putting moisture in the air. However, I would not recommend it for wintertime use as it outputs extremely cold air, and lowers the temperature of its surroundings. Also as other people have expressed it turns dirty and stinky rather fast and I was dismayed to have to buy a new filter a couple of weeks after I bought it. It could just be my water, but I find it requires cleaning very often and purchasing of new filters often."
1,terrible malfunction product noise and cold air,"this machine only produce cold air something wrong from factory, today i bought a nice and cheap humedifier in Bed and Bath vaporize my room in minutes.... in resume stay away of this machine,"
2,Water tank...bad design,"Someone wrote here that the water tank is a problem to fill. It is. It is heavy and awkward. And if you are not extremely careful, when water get on the outside, very slippery. I found out just how awkward when I dropped it. Broke the tank and cannot find a replacement. VERY BAD DESIGN.BTW, someone was also complaining about finding filter at Home Depot. I bought my unit at Target. They do (sometimes) have filters for the unit.If there were not problems with the tank I would rate this unit highly. Works well. Is quite."
3,Small humidifier,"Quiet, works well, needs to be refilled daily. Filter only lasted 6 weeks. My local Home Depot doesn't stock replacement filter. Must order online. Buy extras when ordering humidifier."
2,Not Quiet Anymore!,This humidifier was about as quiet as they come for the first few weeks. It abruptly started making a lot more noise. We've tried adjusting everything but the fan just sounds a lot louder now. I don't recommend buying it if the quiet aspect is your prime concern.The filter does need to be changed quite often as the other person mentioned.
1,Worst humidifier ever,"I paid the price for buying an inexpensive humidifier. The filters are expensive, relative to the price of the humidifier, and they mold within a week or two, even with the cleaning cartridge installed (yet another thing to buy). The moldy smell makes it impossible to use - I'm allergic. I bought two replacement filters, when they are gone (this week since they don't last long), I'm trashing this thing. DO NOT BUY. GET A FILTER-LESS ONE."
2,"Cheaply made, doesn't work well","First off, it is described as effective in medium to large rooms. My bedroom is small, and it had little to no effect on the air quality regarding humidity.The ""wick"" filter provided is flimsy and shreds into the well.Secondly, you need to purchase a second special water filter; that is not clear, so you cannot use it out of the box.I used it for 2 weeks, then went to Bed, Bath, Linen & Things with a 20% coupon and bought an AirSuisse machine, which is superior in quality and performance."
3,A Hard Book to Read,"This book contains a great deal of information about John Ford, including interviews that the author actually conducted with Ford. This is great because Ford was such a difficult interviewee. There are tons of stills from the film. However, a great deal of time was devoted to the film They Were Expendable and just a few sentences to the Ford film that won more Oscars than any of the others - How Green Was My Valley.However, the thing I found most difficult, which was not the author's fault, was the typesetting and such. I had the paperback edition and feel the type font size could have been one point larger. In addition, paragraphs and paragraphs were printed in italics to indicate material added at a later date. This was very difficult to read and some other solution should have been found as italics should only be used for emphasis. I just found the book very difficult to read because of the format."
1,Timewaster,"The only reason I gave this 1 star is because I can't give it 0 stars. I had this for over a year, and it was terrible. I was always having to reset it, and it would constantly crash in the middle of transferring files. Then, it would just stop working. I called tech support and their answer was to unplug it for five minutes!!! what is that?I have since bought a Linksys. It not only worked right the first time, it has yet to crash, and it is faster. This D-Link is just a piece of junk."
1,Don't waste your money and sanity on this junk,This is the worst piece of junk I've ever bought. And the customer service people are idiots. I had to send mine in for a replacement and now that has crapped out as well. We even went so far as to hard-wire our computers by going through the attic with 80-ft. of cable and through the walls and disabling the wireless component and it still didn't work!!! Buy the Linksys instead.
1,Can you say S...L...O...W???,"After hours with tech support, email after email, and updating firmware there was no fixing the fact that this router makes for a SLOW connection!!! Don't waste your money!"
4,"Good support, common features, good product for the price","I looked at many brands. D-Link is commonly thought of as a low-end brand, but the packaging and support would say otherwise. The product is packaged very nice, drivers work great (except for a problem with the USB 80211.B D-Link adapter on Win98 but that's another product to be fair), range is fair. Easy out the box setup, I would one problem but a quick tech call to their 24/7 tech support fixed this (and it only took about 3-minutes to get in and talk to a person), very impressed for what you get her for the money.I'll save the performance review for the D-Link USB adapter write up, here I'll just say I'm pretty happy."
4,Pretty good,"Had a little trouble with the installation. I am, however, pleased with the performance. I wish it had a little more range, but it performs as advertised."
4,Heil Mitler!,"This is an incredibly scary and horrifically funny piece of cinema. Matt Mitler (all heil the great one) invites his dumb over-sexed college buddies along to his father's beach house during Spring Break. However, daddy-dearest, ""Big Ed,"" is severely unhinged and on a killing spree! You just can't beat lines like ""Hey, my dad's battle axe is missing"" moments before an over-the-top slaughtering. Not to mention that Pops is mental because - cue flashback - Junior accidentally shot Mom while cleaning his father's rifle... I totally recommend this hilarious horror."
1,PLAGIAT,"This is a plagiat from Franz Bardons book ""Initiation into hermetics"", almost down to pure sentences. He has even adopted Franz arrogant attitude.This writer is hinting all the time about the worlds few initiatet masters, and hinting that he is one of them. Even if the Bardons books are more expensive, they are the ""originals""."
5,What would it be like to be Luke Skywalker?,Buy this CD and you'll find out!! Excellent storyline...detailed graphics of futuristic cities...fast action...great music...many different spaceships with various capabilities...including the Naboo Starfighter and the Millennial Falcon. The Speeder has a cable that can be wrapped around the ATAT giant's legs to make him crash...and you can find game hints and passwords for many extra options on the web...I found myself against overwelming odds and fighting the battle of my life...winning by a millisecond...and shouting YYYEEESSS!!!
5,Wonderful Memory Book,This book is wonderful for the mother who wants to document everything. The loose-leaf feature allows for page additions with ease. This particular book goes up to seven years which is a lot more than most books out there of the same purpose. The cover of this book is a nice fabric with some embroidery. Very pleasing to look at and going to be a cherished piece for years to come.
2,A Halloween Classic ...,"For those of us who've seen the movie umpteen times, this retelling of the classic tale is actually fresh and worth the read ... (witch, by the way, isn't easy .....)"
3,Very different,Not the Wizard of Oz that I grew up with but still a really good story. I haven't finished it yet but so far it's good.
4,What a Wonderful book!,"I never ralized L. Frank Baum wrote so many Oz books. I plan to read them all because this was a good one. While "" The Wizard of Oz"" is my favorite movie of al time this book was very good. Some things were the same as the movie and some things were VERY different. I can't wait to read the others."
5,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,"Good book I really enjoyed it. It had more adventure than I thought it would, will buy it for my sister."
2,The wizard of Oz,This book was good. I saw the movie before the book and the book is nothing like the movie. I thought the movie was better than the book.
1,Bad production run,I've just returned the set for the second time -- CD 2 is labelled correctly but is actually contains the program for CD-1. If you're ordering this I suggest asking the vendor to check CD-2 before mailing.
5,Great for Cichlids,Product was exactly as described and arrived quickly. My fish a healthy and happy!
3,This Newsboys Friend should have stayed.,"Jody Davis Is GREAT with his guitar, but the vocals push it just a little. I personally think he shuold just stay with background vocals in the newsboys. Number 1.It's where Jody belongs,number 2. It's just what he is best at(in the group I mean). Don't get me wrong,Jody has extreme talent in his voice and definitley in his electric guitar playing. So perhaps I'm changing my point of veiw about him. Maybe this c.d is good for a practice sort of thing,that way in his next album he will have some experiance and he will know what people think of him. Although I must I am Ex-tremely disoponted that his tunes sound absoulutly nothing like the newsboys tunes.But who am I to judge a great guy with talent like you've never seen? Listen to it for yourself and see.=-)"
2,Not enough information to succeed,"After completing all necessary examinations for the class this text was required for, there was not enough information for me to glean to produce an adequate business plan which was the major project for my class. Should I continue with my degree plan, I have been informed that I need to contact my instructor for the next class prior to writing any major works for grades. A real disappointment."
4,A good impression of the mature Paul Robeson,A very fine compilation of Paul Robeson's last active years. I am especially fond of two of the rare numbers where he is accompanied by Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee.
2,Some companies WILL distribute anything...,"I don't want to ""diss"" this product or it's filmmakers, however, I've gotta say please, please, please invest in a newer camera for taping (was this 8MM???), and PLEASE use a tripod or some type of stabilizer next time if your hands are so shakey.Thanks."
3,Nothing new....,"Is it just me or does Horner use cues from his Apollo 13 score over, and over, and over???"
1,save your cash--instead donate to save the rainforests,"I think James Horner did a good job with braveheart, but then he developed a stupefying lack of creativity (he could be chewing on lead paint). He copied scores from one movie to another. I think a very essential collaboration exists between the director and music director, because the latter can literally bring the movie to its knees. A director who can't understand this relationship, hints at his mediocre abilities. At one extreme is saving private ryan where speilberg kept the music to the min. and let the unfolding events speak for themselves since that's what was required of the scenes. On the other, the thin red line, whose music (after suspending any judgement about direction) was like putting a car in reverse at 60 mph. Enemy at the gates fits this bill maybe at 20mph."
2,I think I have heard this before,"Knowing that James Horner wrote the music for this movie, I made sure to pay special attention to the soundtrack while watching the film. After it was over, I felt I had just heard a medley of Horner's greatest hits. Through out the movie I heard refrain's similar to ""Braveheart"", ""Titanic"", ""Wrath of Kahn"", ""Apollo 13"", ""Glory"", and even ""Field of Dreams"". Perhaps the great Hollywood composers are running out of ideas! Williams, Zimmer, Barry and Goldsmith have all copied themselves in their most recent work. So I guess you really can't fault Horner too much.Maybe Directors and producers in Hollywood need to go with fresher talent when picking a composer for their next movie. Give these guys some time off to come up with some new ideas."
4,Glory Revisited,"People who like this music and Horner's soundtrack from Titanic should listen to his best soundtrack ever, Glory. Fortunately for those who like it, but unfortunately for those seeking something new, the two are remarkably similar. If you're going to copy from someone, copy from yourself, and copy only your best work."
3,Happy mothers day Lila,This book was alriht but I didn't reallylike the way Lila treated Kate.he didn't liet Kate be she made her all girlish and stylishsomething i obviously don't like girly thingsso in all I would not like that to happen to my mother or father in real life so in all I don't really like this bookit is only OK
3,If only they fixed the articulation,"A nice lamp with good light. The only problem (and it's a big one) is the bolt where head meets upper arm--it's loose, loosens up soon after tightening (because it's plastic), and allows the head to droop so I've kludged it with a paper clip. Disappointing."
2,No more spares??,"I have had this lamp since 2004. In 2007, the wire in back snapped loose. This wire runs upward from the center piece between the bottom legs to the center piece between the lower and upper legs. It snapped because the wire is held in place by s small steel barrel, which fits inside a small receptacle incorporated in that lower center piece. Unfortunately this part is ill-designed because it lacks sufficient metal to counteract the force exerted by the wire. In 2007 Ott-Lite replaced the part and I successfully installed it. Now (January 2011) the metal of this new part gave way again and just like the first one, just broke off. You can see where the metal gave way. It is just poorly designed. I called Ott-Lite and they are not sure they have spare parts of which they could send me one. I am waiting!!!!! Very strange because they are still selling the lamps per their web-site. Unless I hear soon I am going to have to look for an alternative."
3,CRANK IT UP...,"because if you don't, you won't hear anything. This may be the poorest recording job I've ever heard in a mass market CD. It's very low, and extremely muddy. It makes me wonder if anyone listened to this one before duplicating it. However, once you turn in up a little (or a lot), you'll find quite a good CD. MacAlpine, long one of my favorites, has put together a prog-rock album, very much in the genre of Dream Theater and Dali's Dilemma. So once you can hear the music, you'll enjoy it."
5,Susan Lucci fans rejoice!,"We never miss the chance to see Susan Lucci's portrayal of the hard-hearted department store owner who learns what Christmas (and life) are all about. Now that it's (finally) out in DVD, we can watch Miracle At Christmas: Ebbie's Story all year long, without waiting for cable to re-run it.Of course, this film is all you would expect from another version of A Christmas Carol, but this one is such a wonderful production it is not to be missed. For me, this is one of the quintessential Christmas chick-flicks of all time."
1,Ebbie,"Hello. I am a hearing impaired (deaf) customer. I just bought ""Ebbie"" which was closed captioned on Lifetime. Even it has English subtitles on but they did not show any English subtitles. Susan Lucci is one of my favorite actresses. I used to watch her television show ""All My Children"". Ebbie was one of my favorite Christmas movies. I was looking forward to watch it and found out that it did not have closed captioned or English subtitles which was degrading for me. I can not hear what the movie was talking about. Closed captioning or English subtitles are helpful for me and other deaf (hearing impaired) audiences to understand what movies are talking about its main story and plots. We are completely lost what the movie was talking about. I can not return DVD because it is already opened so I am stuck with it now. Others and I found it being a big time insult. Try yourselves to put ear plugs so you can understand what hearing impaired people go through."
3,I have not seen this movie yet but i will soon.,I have bought this because it sounds like it's good.I will watch it soon and then I could give a better review.
4,PLEASED SERVICE!!!!,"THANKS, FOR THE GOOD SERVICE WE RECEIVED. I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE. I WILL ORDER AGAIN FROM YOU!!! YOUR SERVICE WAS RIGHT ON TIME. THANKS, AGAIN!!!!"
3,A Better Movie is available!,"This is not bad, however, a better documentary is Hillary! Uncensored. It was made by a man who had his company stolen from him and was thrown in jail. What was his crime? He got involved with the Clinton's. Though he has been exonerated, the pain brought on him and his family by the Clinton smear machine still lingers. If you want to know why Hillary is not qualified to be President, let alone a Senator; get Hillary! Uncensored (DVD) from Amazon."
1,Boring and cheap,"Very low-quality, boring, I had to stop watching due to boredom.There is no real analysis, only character assasination from people who are one-sided ennemies of Hillary. The critiques are not based on anything verifiable or rational, only subjective statements like ""this person truly is evil"". These attacks are repeated oveone after the other by dozens of people during the whole movie, nothing else is offered.Don't waste your time with this movie."
4,it just rolls on !,"This picks up where ""Sign # 9"" leaves us material wise, but the production takes a murky turn to a dark corrider.The simple rock song approach is still there. Performance is a little punky and straight- forward with a muddy Motorhead like sound. Peter's vocal still holds up through the sludge.Another biscuit for the Jane fan to chomp on. I personally like the variations of their output so I'm used to being suprised..This band rolls on !"
5,My Dog really likes Iams Savory Sauce,"My dog likes the Iams savory sauce. It helps to tempt him to eat when his appetite is off, and it's good for him."
4,made in japan,"excellent item, was intended for sale in japan, nothing in English was written on package but it is just the same, strongly suggest this item!"
3,"I don't buy the Monster hype, but I will buy it at a monster discount.","I picked this up under the Used and New for $19.99 new. For that price, I feel that this cable is a good value. At $30, I'd say it would be a good value as well, but not a penny more. Digital is digital, and I feel that you're primarily paying for the looks and prestige that comes with ""Monster."" If you aren't interested in looks, or don't really care about the Monster name, Monoprice offers the same quality cables at a fraction of the cost."
4,A great read,"This is a thumping good read, in the same manner as Alan Arnold's book -Once Upon a Galaxy: A Journal of the Making of The Empire Strikes Back. The author followed the film crew on their location journeys from Alberta, Canada to the warmer environs of Pinewood Studios, London. This is a fascinating tale of the hardships and highs of making a blockbuster. Packed with good observation. Too long out-of-print."
1,Terrible and a waste of film,"I love zombie films and I thought this one would be along the lines of Special Dead and other low production value, but funny zombie films. It falls apart on every level. The acting is atrocious and worst of all, the story is not funny or inventive. This film feels like something someone invented while they were too lazy to actually think. Please do not waste your money on this garbage, it is not original, funny, scary or interesting."
1,Downright Disgusting,"I have to start off by saying that I don't mind reading the occasional romance novel with an outdated mind set but this is ridiculous.Since when has Harlequin decided that it is alright to portray marital rape in the works they publish. Several scenes made my stomach churn with disgust, this is in no way a love story. Even though Emily repeatedly told him no when he made sexual advances he ignored her wishes and forced himself upon her. I agree with a previous reviewer in saying that I can see how appropriate the title really is.Seeing the caliber of writing that Sara Craven produces and Harlequin willing publishes I have no need to read anything else associated with either party.Harlequin should be ashamed for publishing such disgusting and potentially harmful material and passing it off as a ""love"" story."
1,Ghastly,"I strongly agree with the previous reviewer. If it was possible I wouldn't even give this book a one star. The plot had potential, but the execution was horrible. The characters did not connect on any level. The sex scenes resembled rape, and the ending was abrupt and unsatisfying."
1,Piece of crap!,"Paloma de papel (Paper dove) is really a piece of crap. It explores the over explored world of terrorist from a childs point of view... Director Fabrizio Aguilar, is nothing more than a spoiled child trying to show how much he knows about the live of the poor people in peru, When in fact he doesn't know anything about it. Having grew up in private (Expensive) schools and lived in Miraflores (A residential city in Peru) He should be directing commercials for those expensive products or even better, still acting in the lame soap operas in which que used to act."
5,the feeling of happiness returns,"I bought all of olp's cds in order (except naveed, sadly I've yet to get it) and I have to say that up until gravity the cds just got better and better. Clumsy started it off with an average album filled with hit or miss tracks. Happiness... was an almost perfect cd with a much more refined sound. Then came the spiritual machines, the truly stand out album. When I first bought this cd I thought, ""well its ok but its not happiness..."" then I began to listen to it more and more and I began to see how great it was. A wonderful mixture of the harsh and beautiful rapped into 10 tracks (+ samples). ""Are you sad?"" quickly became not only my favorite song on the cd but one of my favorite all time songs. I buy cds monthly but even then I still come back and listen to this cd."
5,In the age of Our Lady Peace...,"There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said. This album is one of the best of the year, and one of the most refreshing rock records I've heard in a long time. Where most bands lately sound more and more alike, with weak lyrics and bad singers, Our Lady Peace set themselves apart. Everysong on here is worthy of a sing along, they're all moving. My favorite: ""Right Behind You,"" ""In Repair"" ""Life"" ""Are You Sad?"" ""If YOu Believe."" Look, if you're looking for music that moves you, and that is smart and that rocks, and that isn't overplayed and that plain out doesn't suck, check this album, I doubt you'll be disapointed"
5,RARE GEM,"It isn't often that I can listen to an album over and over and discover a new level every time. In fact, when I stumble upon such a well crafted and multi-faceted CD, I want the world to know about it! I invite anyone and everyone to play the whole disc and just listen to the drums, or the bass, or the rhythm guitar, or the lyrics, or the incredible riffs. Each part holds up and reveals new details every time you listen. But to fully appreciate an Our Lady Peace record, you must listen to it as a complete sonic masterpiece. (Was that too melodramatic??) What some people are calling ""digital layering"", hey, you know what? It's called DEPTH! Artists have been doing it for years...by actually adding more than one guitar and a fake drum beat! Their songs are even better and more intricate live!! So if you want a CD that you can listen to a million times and still discover new levels, I totally recommend Spiritual Machines. Depth, intelligent lyrics, and still great rock songs? Am I dreaming??"
5,Spiritually,"The album, 'Spiritual Machines' by Our Lady Peace, is an amazing listen. I started out by sampling the two songs 'In Repair' and 'Life' and couldn't belive how awesome it was. Having now bought the CD, I can only express that I rank it as one of the best CDs I own. Raine Maida's voice is exceptional, and his lyrics matched with the eerie and sometimes appropriately mechanical sound make for a wonderful combination. You can tell the album lives up to its name through the slow, almost touching sounds of the song 'Are You Sad?', to the rock and roll sound of songs like 'Everyone's a Junkie' and 'Made to Heal'. Spiritual Machines is one of the best albums I own to date, and a lot of their other albums are just as great to own. Definately give this band a listen and buy one of the CDs! You won't regret it!"
1,Bizarre behavior,This mouse makes it very difficult to type text. Something about the wireless system causes the cursor to randomly jump to other parts of the page or even to other applications every few seconds. You have to watch very carefully what you are typing or you will suddenly be adding text to a paragraph several lines above where you think you are. I'm going back to Logitech.
2,Not really worth the time,"Like the movie, this game is slapdash, silly, and too much of the same old stuff to make it worth the time and effort required to make your way through it. Don't bother unless you're really enamored of Jar-Jar."
2,not a true texturizer,"I bought this product for my daughter who has thick hair. Previously I was using Phytospecific which is great (read the reviews on it) but very expensive ($60). Her hair was very soft and the product didnt over process it(loved it). Now that I'm unemployed, I was looking for an inexpensive alternative. I knew the traditional boxed relaxer would probably be too strong so I went with the texturizer. I'm glad I didn't get the relaxer because this made my daughters hair bone straight and dry. I used two conditioners and oiled it really good so the dryness doesn't break it off."
1,straightened hair,yes i followed directions. i very foolishly thought this product will loosen my then 5 year old daughter's coily hair. i certainly did not expect it to become straight. i was then left with caring for straight hair and was advised to continue use. i tried my best but two years down the road her hair is damage and breaking off. so now we are transitioning and i am being more thorough with hair hair and doing research. will never recommended or reuse this product!
2,Music Box dosen't work,"This mobile is really cute, but the music box does not work most of the time. If it does start after it is wound it only lasts a few seconds."
3,a 50's musical that is actually about the smart older sister,"Two sister come to New York and settle in the cheap side of town.The younger sister has been robbing the older one of male friendswithout meaning to be being beautiful, talented and good natured.This apartment makes a pit look good and was previously rentedby a prostitute, so the have the beat officer looking in their window.This movie must have been one of Jack Lemmon's first starring roles.Betty Garrett who co-stars went on to be a long term characteractress in films and TV: she isn't actually homely,but the young Janet Leigh ( before Tony Curtis) is the heart throb here.Many women went to New York and Hollywood to try to ""make it""in those years: the tradition seems to live on.Neither of these two girls end up waiting tables in the dinner,but they almost go home empty.I liked the movie with the country girls fighting off the big city wolves."
3,Good look'n Headphones but not an,"These phones are one of the best looking phones on the market, even though it is just all plastic. Construction quality was good though one cushion was sewed differently than the other but what can you expect for [inexpensive]headphones.I bought it due to one magazine saying it sounded very good, but I found it not ""airy"" sounding at all, especially in the bass due to it's open back. It sounded pretty plain, like any other cheap headphone but I'm no headphone expert and I haven't listened to other phones very much to compare. I did have a KOSS ESP-950 and if I recall the one song I compared it with, I wasn't drawn into it like I remember where I wanted to listen to it over and over. That's when I think I changed my mind. Maybe you might find it different as all our musical taste and ears differ. At a [$$$] dollar level it might sound a tad better than the rest at that level, if not, it's at least one good-looking headphone."
4,Santa Billy sings Nice look forward to Naughty follow up,It's a fun and festive romp for the holidays. Old classics and a few originals with no worries about language or subject matter around the ever age eclectic crew you have for holidays cheers!
2,Ouch.,"The whole album lacks feeling and energy. He could have attacked some of these songs and made them fun. Unfortunately the whole album sounds ad if it was recorded in a garage with a hammond organ and a sedated vocalist.For a moment I thought Billy was making a joke, but by the end of the album, I was simply shaking my head. It's not bad, just no life."
1,So Disappointed,"I have been a fan of Billy Idol's for 30 years, and I could not have been more disappointed in this CD. He (normally) has such a powerful voice with a nice range, and this CD almost sounded like he was joking around. He could have done so much justice to the songs he chose, but they all fall painfully short of even his mediocre work. C'mon Billy, we know you have much better things to offer."
5,Great stuff!!,It's the ONLY Xmas album I can listen to. Great stuff.Funny and actually a feel-good album.
5,Definitive Oz-Rock,"You want Oz-Rock at it's finest? Just listen to Bow River. Hear Ian Moss' amazing voice (and he ain't even the lead singer). Hear the band kick in for the second verse. Hear it lift when Jim Barnes joins in for the chorus. Experience the intensity in Mossy's crunching guitar solo and then, when you think it can't scale any new peaks, feel your hairs stand on end when Barnes comes in for the final screaming verse. It all finishes with Moss bringing it back down to earth. I'm always breathless by the end of this song. As for the rest of the disc, all I'll say is there's not a dud song on there, esp Wild Colonial Boy, No Good For You, Hound Dog (love the bridge), and the classic, classic pop of Forever Now. Stunning music."
3,This bundle is a rip-off!,"This bundle includes one book already included in the Atlantis bundle. So, if you bought that bundle as well then you got robbed of one book. Therefore, this bundle should be cheaper."
4,Zig is an amazing speaker,"A renowned writer and speaker, Zig Ziglar is known for his passionate and empowering presentations - even if you're not a self-help junkie, do yourself a favor and pick up one of his audio books for the experience. 'Over the Top' is all about goal setting, performance, and motivation. As with any self-help book, there is plenty of repetition, and a few insightful examples. Personally, it helped me identify several new areas for improvement, as well as, reminded me of several habits which I have forgotten. The only word of warning: there is a heavy dose of messaging on spirituality and religion. If you're new to the self-help section, I would recommend starting with Jack Canfield's 'The Success Principles'."
3,Damnation of Faust,"It is impossible to rate this CD. Berlioz is the composer, not the performer!! Which orchestra? Which conductor? Who are the singers? We need a lot more information."
4,pod racer,I love this game i played it for a long time but i lost it and iam going to get it again anyway its awsome i say everybody should play.
5,Long overdue and warmly welcomed,"Nothing could have delighted me more than to learn of the release of these two fine lps by Christy Moore. Most of this CD is acoustic, and if you are a Planxty fan the more electrified cuts can be a bit of a shock at first, but they will soon grow on you. Highly recommended. There's not a bad song in the lot."
4,Great series for a range of yoga capabilities.,"I got this series for a friend's birthday after she checked the Fire DVD out from the library & loved it. I've done the Earth & Water videos with her & I think they're great. Very instructional. They really made me pay attention to my posture & I realigned myself several times after realizing I wasn't getting the most out of a pose. I have't attempted the Fire one yet, my friend said it was pretty intense! But I think the other 2 are suitable for someone at any level of experience."
4,Total Yoga DVD set of 4,Very nice set of 4 Total Yoga DVD's--varying levels of difficulty. Speedy delivery from Ohio distributor. Thanks for adding to my healthy lifestyle.
2,needs more crash visual action...,"good video q, needs more action like battling rockets in space for the added exciting drive to this more wanted space visual action and more action about the moons all to show it lenghthilly than what is. needs a lil more of things to make better star rating for this almost unknown film"
5,Description omits one of the two leading actors --,"Amazon omits Leonardo Sbaraglia, who plays Pedro.Another viewer has written about the incredible (syn)ergy and spontaneity that emerges in the scenes with Sbaraglia and Alterio--it just gets with every passing year. Alterio is in his 80s now. This film is a school for actors, besides being a great film for film makers and viewers.None at Amazon? Available at Best Buy (apparently) and elsewhere, like in 14 installments on youtube."
3,Pricey and Padded,"I was surprised to find most similar books at the local bookstore priced under $9, but if this book was truly victorian it would be worth it. But the BACK cover expands the title to ""VICTORIAN AND VICTORIAN-INSPIRED FARMHOUSES"". These are not the homes you'd expect to see in Cape May, NJ, but there are some floorplans I really like. But if it lacked the ""victorian-inspired"" and was under $9 retail, it would be much improved."
2,Disappointly modern,"I was extremely disappointed when I finally got my hands on this book, because I was expecting another Dover-style collection of period house plans. I was unimpressed by the ""Victorian-inspired"" designs because they're only Victorian enough to fool the casual observer. Only the ones from Historical Replications were any good in my opinion, and there were precious few of those. All the rest were rambling modern homes with a few cornices and a porch, only the outsides referencing real Victorian architecture."
4,Great Camera,"This Camera is pretty good for a first digital camera. If you are using a PC (you have to for the drivers to work!) and running windows ME or better you can even make movies with Windows Movie Maker (Go To START>PROGRAMS>ACCESSORIED>WINDOWS MOVIE MAKER), you can add music and voices! It also triples as a webcam! The software that comes with the camera is great. It includes Ulead Photo Express 4, Cool 360, and AVI Creator! The function (Ct) allows you to take 10 second video clips when not attached to a PC. This Camera is a great inexpensive, i know i love mine!"
4,GRUDD!,"Mega-City One Space Shuttle Justice One is playing host to Judge Dredd when a Judge is murdered. With only a skeleton crew on board, Dredd's list of suspects is small, but troublesome: They're all fellow Judges....Justice One is ruined by the #1 problem I have with some Dredd stories: All of the Judges look exactly alike, so telling them apart in a whodunit is pretty tough. In the end, not only did I not KNOW whodunit, I didn't care. Justice One is a pretty weak Ennis/Dredd entry, but the back-up stories, Twilight's Last Gleaming, Ex-Men, Talkback, and especially A Man Called Greener, are all much more fun.....after all, how often do you get to see a major traffic pile-up caused by phlegm?"
1,This does not fit all walkers.,"This does not fit all walkers. The design has top hooks and bottom half rings for support. Must fit your walker exactly. This is not a universal walker that hangs on with straps, etc. I bought this on Amazon from ""Medical for you."" It could not be used with a walker I just bought on Amazon. Return at your own expense. Seller taked no responsibility for fit and webpage does not warn about fitting problem."
3,The School of Dread,"The Goosebumps TV series, based on the books by R.L. Stine, aired in the late 1990s and is famous for it's low-budget special effects, bad acting, and bad script adaptions.In the Perfect School Part 1 & 2, Brian O'Connor gets shipped off to a private military like school, after his parents got tired of him picking on his younger brother, not cleaning his room, and his falling grades. The students that graduate from the school are perfect, too perfect. As the school is cloning the students and sending the clones back home.Perfect School is one of the worst adapted episodes from R.L. Stine's books. The sets are horrible, the acting is dreadful, and the dialogue is laughable. There is a twisted ending but it is predictable.Younger kids may like the Perfect School, while older kids and adults may have trouble getting through it."
1,Not useful,"I didn't like the organization of the book. I find it quite dated and and with the advent of online publishing and such, this book is not very useful."
2,Force Commander in short,"Star Wars Force Commander over all is not a good game, in fact it stinks. However it does have its place and it can be fun, its not a game you would rave about and tell your friends they had to play it but it can be some fun to stomp your opponents with AT-Ats. Though I recommend Star Wars Galactic Battle grounds if you must have a Star Wars RTS, it is a AOE 2 clone but its allot more fun than this."
1,Worst SW game ever,With its hefty system requirements this game is crap!! You need a certain type of video card to run this thing properly so watch out!!
1,Spend your time with a good film -- this isn't it,"This self-important piece of cinematic twaddle achingly strives for artiness. Instead, it achieves only confusion and irrelevance.""Female Perversions"" would make an excellent study for a cinematography class about how NOT to make a film. It was poorly conceived, poorly written, poorly acted, poorly directed and poorly edited. Even the audio engineer didn't get it right: the audio track is low level and sometimes muffled.The angst that oozes from the lead character rides like a thick, noxious fog through the film. Plot situations are never fully explained or developed. The disjointed dialogue often stops and starts seemingly at will. The sex scenes are never fully consummated and are as interesting as Dr. Ruth on Valium.Spend your money on something more meaningingful and entertaining than this dog."
1,Look for a different book,"Don't buy this!The ""book"" is a bunch of photocopied papers, many of which are just there as space filler (e.g., a ream of sample appraisal forms -- you already saw these when you bought your house, there's no need to see multiple pages of the appraisal form for another propert).The video is especially bad; it just drips sleaze. It conveys the image of the sleazy salesman remininscent of the cheap promotional videos that you'll occasionally catch on the TV."
1,"ZERO stars, or worse","WARNING: Lee Burbidge IS a ""sleazy salesman"", through and through. I worked for him and his sons for a few years, and became very intimately acquainted with their business practices. Lee's son Brae, by the way, interestingly enough also posted a review on this page (see the September 10th entry). I'd be suspect of any review of this ""book"" posted from their homebase of Utah. The Burbidge's are not interested in providing quality services to the public. They are long-time seminar shysters who will take advantage of anyone unlucky enough to wander into their web."
1,For Sale By Owner: How to Sell Your Home Yourself & Save Th,I purchased this Book/tape set based on the other reviews. Don't waste your money! The book looks as though the author photocopied pages & drawings and put some staples through the center to make a book. No new info. in here that you couldn't find in other cheaper books!
5,Wonderful Little Set,Ordered this set not to cook with but as a Hostess Serving Set to use with my vintage melamine ware & tupperware....perfect
4,Wildfire - Cathie Linz,"DESCRIPTION FROM BACK COVERShe was the original Ice Princess--tall, blond, aloof Amanda Richards, Associate Librarian of Deer field College, a woman with everything under control -- until an arsonist set the campus ablaze and a persistent detective set her heart afire.Brady Gallagher didn't look like a cop, but nothing escaped his laser gaze -- including the icy Miss Richards, who challenged his mettle from the moment they met. Afraid of love, running from marriage, Amanda sensed danger--and desire. His burning kisses seared her soul. Was this the love that promised to banish her fears at last...or a reckless passion that would bring heartache as it raged wildly out of control?"
4,Above Us The Waves,It is a classic war film of submarine service an I would recommend it to war movie fans. The cast portrayed the life on submarines in wae very good.
5,You have to put the book down to eat and sleep,"Mr. Loeb has done a wonderful job of weaving aviation, foreign intrigue and the evil side of the illegal drug industry. It is all possible and even more believable after 9/11, even the descriptions of the B-727 being flown like a fighter. It is obvious that Mr. Loeb has some time in that aircraft. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has lived on the edge or wishes they could. But it is not for the faint of heart, it's real, though fiction, it can happen, though it hasn't, and it is told in a story line of an aircraft accident investigator's viewpoint, which gives it a uniqueness of its own. Don't wait for the movie, although, I am, now that I read the book."
5,blast from the past,"Tastes exactly as I remember it from childhood. I ordered this when I read that Willie Wonka tangy Laffy Taffy is the revised name of my old favorite ""Tangy Taffy"". What a treat."
5,"A subjective, personal, and disturbing book","It's not surprising that this book generates extreme reactions - good and bad. It's an extreme book and won't be to everyone's taste. One reviewer who pans it called it disturbing. I agree with the description but loved the book. It's Jamil Nasir's most personal and subjective effort to date, and he pursues issues regarding human meaning and our place in the universe more deeply than most other SF or fantasy writers, or, for that matter, fiction writers in general. Some readers won't like where Nasir comes out, and they may be ""disturbed,"" even revolted, by the trip along the way. I say it's a hell of a ride, and I look forward to more such rides from this original and talented writer."
1,Dead failed after six shots.,"After taking about six shots the camarea developed a black area on the right side of the image. I purchased a Canon XT made in Japan not China. I live in Toronto Canada and the camera was shipped surface using United Postal Services (UPS) they charged me CND $44.00 in brokerage fees, this was on top of the $29.00 I paid for shipping (this was refunded) and I also incured CND $22.00 for return shipping. I still have to figure out how to get the GST and PST returned.I did receive a prompt refund on returning the camera. Be aware of the costs when purchasing on line outside Canada. I was told that there would be no brokerage costs if the item had been shipped by air."
2,Jimi as heard on an elevator,"Maybe I'm missing the point but these acoustic renditions do little for me. Without the energetic feedback and vocals that are the hallmarks of Jimi's work the songs left me feeling like something was missing. I don't have problems with tributes, especially ones done by peers of the artist but this one is for muzak lovers only."
2,"Buy her other CDs, not this one","....Unless you really like ""smooth jazz"" better than the real thing. I heard Rachel explain on the radio that her record label wouldn't let her do what she really wanted on this recording, so don't blame her! This is okay for its type, but to hear what an amazing artist she is, buy ""A Room of One's Own"" or ""On The Milkyway Express."""
5,"Lovely Lady, gifted piano player","I have not heard a female keyboardist this good since Keiko Matsui. I too saw Rachel on BET on Jazz and enjoyed her traditional jazz set up. But I knew ahead of time that she was a smooth jazz artist. I am impressed at any smooth jazz artist who is capable to play in the old acoustic combo set. I love the album, especially tracks 1-3."
2,"Starts well, meanders into blandness.","Bryan Brown is a special effects man who is caught up in a government conspiracy after a major mishap. This ""high-tech"" thriller begins fairly well before falling apart with badly choreographed action scenes, predictable twists, and a very underwhelming finale. ..."
5,Good movie,Great suspense movie and I was surprised that it was way back in 1986 when this was first released. Worth watching out for the sequel and buying both together.
5,History from the Chinese side. Unfiltered.,"Both of Hu Sheng's histories, this one as well as his classic ""Imperialism and Chinese Politics"", provide badly-needed purely Chinese perspective on modern Chinese history and China's struggle with the West from late Qing dynasty onward. Hu Sheng's attack is powerful, fresh, insightful, startling, and, yes, appropriately angry. The anecdotes and sources, taken from Chinese language histories, are extremely valuable, and largely unavailable in English language histories of China. Do not be put off with Hu Sheng's political affiliations. His views are shared by Chinese across the spectrum, all over the world. In a world in which establishmentarian Western scholars have so badly clouded, neutered,inculcated and ""made safe"" the history of China, and the Chinese side of the story, Hu Sheng's analysis is a treasure."
3,Vice,It works as advertised just fine. Casting is a little ragged but for the price it's just what I needed.
2,Okay for Beginners,"Unfortunately, not all Palm operating systems will run all Palm programs. Many of the programs given in this book will not run on all Palm PDA's. Maybe Palm operating systems are on the way out and Microsoft CE may be on the way in. Time will tell."
3,Not Enough Yarn... :(,"Love latch hook and this design ""would"" have been great ""IF"" they would have given my daughter enough yarn. Ran out of a couple colors before it was done. Very disappointed. :("
3,took more concentration than expected,"When I did latch hooks as a kid they were simple designs in primary colors. The ones I've done from Caron are much nicer, but they involve so many different shades of yarn that it actually becomes a headache trying to make the picture come out as described. You can't choose the shade of yarn based on the design printed on the mat because the colors on the mat bleed from one square to the next. Your best bet is to follow the pattern which comes with the printed instructions- ""five of green, then 3 of white, then one of light yellow""- and even that can get confusing. Also I could do with some more yarn. Overall, I'm happy with how my rugs came out, but the process was more stressful than I had expected."
5,A good lesson in German History,A very good read about the advances in German science and culture before the Nazi's. Not too often I read a book that I can't put down. Fritz Stern has simply nailed it with this book.
3,"Good Style, but","I like the Tea Shop books and was looking forward to a new series. I love New Orleans; a series set there could be so intriguing, and Carmela is a spunky, clever heroine. There is a ""but.""There was too much detail on scrapbooking for a reader not interested in that hobby. Also, I didn't really care who committed the murder. The supporting characters, except for Ava, blended together and weren't particularly likable.Carmela was also too forgiving for my taste. I thought that her support of a husband who had deserted her made her seem weak. The series needs a strong male character, and I'm hoping it won't be that husband!I will read the next book in the series, if there is one, for I like Laura Child's writing style. This just wasn't one of her better efforts."
2,"A great voice, diminshed","Neal Coty's first disc ""Chance and Circumstance"" brought me something extraordinary and new. So individual, so sharp and moving. ""Legacy"" on the other hand offers the general Country wash that can be had by the bucket-full on any corporate owned Nashville driven radio station. The man has GREAT TALENT, but he somehow let his tremendous and idiosyncratic personality -- his musicianship and his songwriting -- get buried here. I would love to see Neal return with a third disc that lets us hear his voice again. Man, I feel cruddy writing a negative review here. I love this guy's work. Buy his first disc. Buy two! It is spectacular."
4,Great Adventure Game,"This game became one of my favorite 'adventure games'. I like to keep my reviews condensed. It did run a little short, especially in comparison to Black Mirror. It was spooky, but very good, and worth while. It is a short sweet game, somewhat like Dark Fall. I do wonder why these games are getting short, and less cost-effective.There should be not too much trouble playing it through, It may get a little tricky now and then, but fairly straight forward in a fitted space frame. You will need very little help from internet sites like: Walkthrough, hintlines, and uhs.I would fully recommend this game as a good run in the genre. One of my favorites."
2,Does not have 360 degree turn...,"I've played Myst games and Scratches, and although the first 2 Myst games were without the 360degrees turn, Myst 3 and 4 had 360 degree turn in the game. The reason the first 2 Myst games did not have 360 turn was that they came out in the early 1990's. This game did not have that, and I was expecting it to have it, mainly because its a recently new game that probably came out last year or so. Another thing is I just didn't care for this so I returned it for a refund. Sorry to be the only one here who didn't pick up interest in this one."
2,Problem encountered with this product,"Was given this product as gift at Christmas. Was supposed to work on an IMac with a OS of 9.2. Had problems from the original installation. Called Epson (in California) and was advised to download a new driver. It was 10.5meg in size and after downloading and installing, the scanner continued to give me problems. It would scan a 35mm slide but would not enlarge it and would not print anything but a 1""square pic. After several calls to Epson (costing me for the calls) since they do not have an 800# for technical problems. I decided that it was not worth the trouble and returned the product to Amazon. Of course since it was not there problem it will cost me to pay for the return. I feel that the tech. manuals were not well written and seemed to be geared toward those using Windows and not Macintosh."
2,Epson 2400 Perfection Scanner is not perfect,"The Perfection 2400 scanner is the first Epson product that I have bought. The scanner and software installed on my HP Laptop running XP Pro. The photo scans are fine, however, the Copy applet does not recognize my HP p1100 printer. I contacted the Epson support line and they recommended that I set up a dummy Epson printer. The copy utility will now run. The problem is that you need to keep the Epson dummy printer as the default in order to get the copy utility to run and then change to your printer to make a copy. After making copies, you then need to reset you printer to the default printer..."
1,product does not live up to the epson advertising,"I have been extremly disappointed by this scanner, likely the problem is the software, tried to use their help, not toll free, and found it less than helpful, as if they didn't care. Tried to find the software patch, and the support web site was not helpful and when I make another phone call, got no help that solved the problems. Was advised to buy another operating system, don't think that is the answer. Would not recommentd this scanner."
4,Engrossing Adventure,"Having read ""Skybreaker"" without having read ""Airborn"", I can still enthusiastically recommend this yarn. Too often, sequels depend on the earlier volume and have little integrity as stand-alone titles. And this one stands boldly on its own, head and shoulders above many other YA adventure books. This is a richly detailed alternative-history/light fantasy with interesting characters and intriguing turns of plot, all set in a unique, pseudo-realistic world. Precocious younger readers will enjoy the manageable complexity and scientific elements; older readers will share Matt's desire to assert his independence and prove his worth. Parents and teachers may rest assured that it is uncontroversial, with the possible exception of a scene or social drinking and cigar smooking."
4,A good debut album from young bachata artists,"I bought this album blindly in 2001 not knowing anything about ""Nueva Era"" prior to my purchase but I was confident that their bachata would have an authentic rhythm and sound. This group is Dominican (from NY) but have captured the authenticity of bachata music. The album has a nice line up of songs with wonderful lyrics that have meaning and a story behind the words. I was not too keen about the merengues but other than that this group has potential. The only way they would not succeed is if they get caught up in producing mainstream bachata which usually includes English lyrics. A recommended purchase."
4,2nd Edition just released,"For those fretting about the lack of CSS2 support in this book, fear not! The second edition was just released, and covers through CSS 2.1I have the older edition, and can't wait to get my hands on the new one. Very handy if you're working on a website but not actually online at the time. (If I'm online I just ""Google it"" and generally get it faster that _any_ paper book could!)This book is truly a reference for people who already know CSS -- it is not great for teaching you if you're not already familiar. But for what it is, it is very nicely done."
3,Disappointed,"I have been trying to find the song, ""Cry to Me"" for a very long time. Finally, when I do find it, it sounds like Solomon Burke must be on fast speed singing it. In Dirty Dancing it was the original, slow paced, sensuous song, this version is not worth listening to. Nothing else on this CD could be worth anything if this song can't cut it."
5,Still the best of both worlds...,"Well, I have waited to do this review until all the other companies released their products. I think the Makita sets offer the homeowner to remodeler the best size/weight/power ratio of them all. The Milwaukee/Rigid Li-ion sets are just too bulky for most and seem better suited to contractors. I have a substantial tool collection and researched each of them before I bought. This set suits my expectations of quality, design and price."
4,Lite and bright,"This was a perfect book for vacation time, lunchbreaks, and deserted beaches. I enjoyed the adventures of poor Rollin ""The Logical"" in the first part and Joe's predicament in the second half. I'm not one for fantasy or such, but I'm glad I got my hands on this book. Again, save it for your lighter moments."
1,"Fantastic design, very bad reliability","I love these headphones! I have loved each of the six -- yes, six!! -- pair I've had. I love them so much that every time they quit working, I go back for more.As a previous reviewer noted, sweat seems to ruin these headphones -- easily. I use them on the treadmill, and each pair has lasted somewhere between six weeks and six months.If you're buying these for non-workout purposes, I very highly recommend them. If you plan on doing some sweating, either go ahead and buy several pair or keep shopping."
1,"An Awful Product, Even Worse Customer Support","I agree completely with the other reviewers. They don't fit. But my biggest problem was the urethane earpieces. After 28 days, I found one on the kitchen floor and the other one missing entirely. I tried to put the remaining one back on -- it wouldn't stay. It was as flimsy as a grape peel. (I suspect that, if they even used any, the adhesive behind the earpieces probably failed after a few weeks of heat and sweat.)I was able to return my headphones to the retailer -- on the 30th day of a 30-day return policy. Before that, I called the Philips ""Consumer Care"" 800 number. I was told there was NO warranty on the product (unless it was purchased along with an audio product), and they could not supply replacement earpieces. I was given NO options -- and not even an apology.Brilliant people at Philips/Nike, huh?"
5,Chandler at his best,"Raymond Chandler writes detective stories the way they were meant to be written. His style and plotlines bringyou into the age that they were written, with all the warts and sleeze of the time period. The class of the genre"
3,FM tuner fades out,"Bought this stereo system from HEB food store here in San Antonio for $99. The only problem I have had with it is that, as several other reviewers have noted, the FM radio stations seem to fade out a couple of minutes after you turn it on. You can turn it off and turn it back on, or just switch around to a few different stations and then switch back to the station you want to listen to, and it will be okay for awhile.All the other features on this stereo system work great, and the thing has exceptional sound quality. Unfortunately, one of the main things I like to listen to is the local NPR station, so I'm still debating the fate of this stereo. Right now I just have a clock radio sitting on top of it for when I want to listen to the radio, but that just ain't right!....lol"
2,Waste of Money,My Daughter played with this for about a week before becoming completely bored with it. Don't waste your money on this toy.
2,"Booklet, Not a Book","Haven't read it yet but was disappointed to get a booklet, not a book! I'll plan to update after I read through it, but at first glance it looks like info I could easily get from articles on the internet.UPDATE:Read it - it has some useful info such as tests to ask for...however, I still say it's a booklet, not a book and should be advertised this way. It begins on page 6 and has about 50 very small, large type pages. If it had been advertised as a booklet and was about $3, that would be about right."
1,Don't buy this scanner.,I had the scanner for maybe a year. I didn't use it much. Without any reason it stopped working properly. All the images I scan are blurry with blue and red all over. Terrible!!!
3,Thought provoking but flawed look at development work,"This book is about two things: first, the exhiliration, futility and frustration of trying to save the world; second, the crazy freedom of the expat lifestyle. Both are good stories and well told, but they don't belong in the same book, and each theme suffers from being linked with the other. Ken and Andrew's journey from idealist do-gooders to disillusioned veterans with just enough hope left to justify one more mission - and the inevitable descent into hell - is heartbreaking. Heidi's story is less interesting. It's mostly just a outlandish series of sex and drug stories. I'm recommending to my friends - and believe me, everyone in the development community is buzzing about this book - that they read Andrew and Ken first, then read Heidi separately."
2,one big bore,"this is a book that put me to sleep...cannot figure out why this was written...not interesting....does not read well....awful pictures....maybe the book itself needs ""Emergency Sex"" is as boring as the UN itself"
2,toilet tissue,"this is a mean spirited book meant solely to soil the good name of the men and women who give their time and lives to the United Nations.....Heidi Postelwait.....Andy Thomson......Ken Cain.....why not give all your money from the book sales, not just 5% to charity?Hang your heads in shame!!"
4,Should be on the Adult Human Required Reading list,"I have a good friend at church who is a survivor of the Rwandan genocide back in the 1990s--and while she survived, most of her family did not. As a result, this book had an additional impact on me. This book made me laugh, shudder, and weep, the last both in sorrow and in pride of what we humans do. It is also a powerful indictment of the United Nations and its approach to humanitarian crises.My only complaint is that Postlewait's detailed description of some of her sexual encounters was far more than I cared to know, and I suspect that may hold true for other readers as well. But even with that, the book is a must-read. ..bruce.."
3,Interesting?,"Really a collection of personal memoirs of pedestrian interest....however what the group of authors see during their many travels with the UN and some of the ""unusual"" activities they spot some UN personnel and officials engaged in has the UN brass in NYC nervous.....the UN has reserved the right to fire two of the authorswho currently work for the organization...many UN staffers have mixed feelings on the book and whether it should have been published...update UN refusesto say how they will treat the authors.....UN now says it is mad not on the content of the book but because it was sold to Miramax before asking for UN approval.....you figure?"
4,Challenges our misogynist society...finally!,"Any thinking person knows that what is taught as ""religion"" is hypocritical nonsense designed to keep the boys in charge. I'm thrilled to see another mainstream work that challeges that idea.I also appreciate the extent of the historical background given for this information, alot of research has been done. Thank you!"
3,"Same, but different","I graduated from Berkeley High 11 years ago. Social aspects of the school are the same, ""tracking"" students seems to be the same, I had 3 principals in the 4 years I was there, but are these kids learning anything? The book seems to focus on classtime being spent talking about current issues at the school (racism, crime, death) rather than the main reason kids go to school. When I went there, a paper was not accepted if it was turned in late - period. If this is the case, college (and ""real life"") is going to be a great big slap in the face. An accurate portrayal of the high school, but not complete enough."
1,Mushy Thinking,"Ms. Maran tells the story of three likeable high school students as they navigate a year at Berkeley High School in California. Had she stayed with the kids' stories, this would be a nice little book. Unfortunately, Ms. Maran has a Much Bigger Agenda. Before you waste time on the book, it is only fair you know what her agenda is. At the end of the book, Ms. Maran offers five recommendations for America's schools. The first is to abolish private schools. Her vision then becomes clear. If all America's children can't be raised with a good education, then none should. And heaven forbid that caring underprivileged parents should have the right to an educational choice for their children. Under the guise of the story of a year at a high school, Ms. Maran starts and ends with the premise that childrens' future should be held hostage to her views of equality. Few parents, even in oh-so-liberal Berkeley, are willing to accept that."
2,Works well; unpleasant scent; TINY tin,"I've had great success using different kinds of shea butter, mostly to make my feet look better in sandles. I've always wanted to try L'Occitane's products but hesitated because they seem expensive. I was happy to find this mini tin of pure shea butter. I guess I didn't read the size carefully when I ordered as I was surprised at how tiny this tin actually was when it arrived. Still, I know a little shea butter goes a long way so I didn't mind too much. Yet when I opened the tin I was struck by the unpleasant smell. I've used pure, refined shea butter (no scent) and pure, unprocessed shea butter (slightly nutty scent) before, but neither smelled like the L'Occitane mini shea butter tin I received. The shea butter works well but the smell is so unpleasant to me that I'm only using it on my feet when I wear socks and shoes, or at bedtime. It softens my heels well and keeps them looking soft but I will try another brand of pure shea butter next time."
4,"Great Television, Bad back!!","I have owned this television for 3 years now and I am just as satisfied today when I power it up as I was the day I took it out of the box. The color is superb and the 40"" screen is the ONLY one of its kind in a tube television. Sony has definitely proven itself worthy with this television. It's HD ready and the color/picture quality is unmatched by other tubes. You will even be hard pressed to find a LCD/Plasma in this size to compare w/ the quality. Definitely worth the time/money IF you can find one!!!! The ONLY drawback is this beauty's size/weight, find a good/strong friend to help you load/unload this beast!! Otherwise, you will get to experience EVERY single feature of this tv as you nurse your hernia!!!!!"
3,Okay; but...,"Used on a '99'Cadillac Concourse; Instructions,especially those for wiring; FAR TOO VAGUE for the average home DIY'er. Had to take it to a Pro to connect wiring."
5,Fern,"I love this series of books. It is fun to see how this family interacts with each other, building a strong bond, tying them together, helping each achieve love and happiness."
5,fantastic series!,"Couldn't put it down! Start with reading ""Rose"", then you can understand and fall in love with the Randolph clan. As a person who grew up on the south side of Chicago, I never would have imagined reading a series such as this. Leigh Greenwood is a phenomenal writer. I find myself lost in his novels. Wait until you get to Lily! It's absolutely hilarious and so full of heat! I can't wait to read Iris!"
4,Not as good as her others,"I have all of Suzanne's books and while this one is full of good information, she tends to go on and on about her new products and items you can buy from her. A lot of it reads like an infomercial for somersweet and other products she sells. Several of her recipes in this book call for somersweet and she doesn't offer the conversion for any of the other artificial sweeteners. So unless you plan to purchase somersweet from her (which is very good by the way, but pricey) you will need to do some homework on how much splenda, equal, etc..you'll need to make some of these recipes. Overall it's a really good book and the recipes are wonderful, just be aware that you'll be extremely tempted to purchase some of her somersweet products on her website."
1,this printer is JUNK,"I got the printer with my new laptop a year ago, after having it for about 6 months, it just stopped printing, i went to the epson website and went through a tutorial and that didnt help so they suggested i call the customer service number, when i called they informed me it would cost $10 just to talk to someone, this really pissed me off, to get the printer fixed it is going to cost more than i actually paid for it, so im throwing the piece of crap in the trash and buying a new and better printer. i wouldnt waste your time on this hunk of junk, plus it was always running out of ink when it actually printed."
2,not up to parr,"i found that this printer was very slow,and not as clear as my old one,i also could not find cart, at any stores in the dfw area,,,,,,it was very disapointing to me,,,,,"
3,Problems with the newer ones?,"Bought one 6 months ago and love it. Got another one for my sister but the background scan had a green tint to it plus it made a scratchy sound when scanning. Return it for another one, this time the scan image had a green tint to it. Both were brand new at the store so I can't figure out what the problem was?"
4,I love it!,"It's so great. So compact,and looks sharp.It's easy to install and use.And the price is good."
2,faulty buttons,My buttons also do not work. Reinstallation did not help. I returned my scanner and got a new one. The buttons still don't work. Has anyone figured out what the problem might be?
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"These Calphalon One pans are the newer NON-STICK versions of their GREAT Calphalon One pans. Extremely overpriced!if your an beginner cook, your better off getting a few cheap non-stick pans are your local discount department store.If you want pans to last a lifetime and pans that have the best of all worlds, get the Anodized Calphalon One pans, NOT this Non-Stick version. Those pans are worth every penny!"
5,very satisfied!,The DVD arrived sooner than I had expected and it was all I thought it would be. The cost was decent and the quality was of the highest atandard. I only shop here at amazon now!
4,I don't know why...,"I like this show, and for the life of me, I can't pinpoint why. The humor is goofy. I'm guessing it has everything to do with David Spade's comedic timing. Recommended if you're into goofy humor."
5,Great bible study book,"We purchased this book to replace the one we had on loan from the library for a bible study we joined.We both have very much enjoyed this book. Easy to read, easy to relate and love the challenges it offers.Definitely worth the purchase!Ordered, confirmed and received package just as stated. Great service."
3,perfect title,"Ok I know the stuff that's goin on in this movie, probably happens every day, somewhere in this world. Kind of gives you heebies a little. I rated it a 3, because I'm sure I've seen worse."
1,2 for the price of one...Worth it?,"These 2 movies are really really horrible. They fit the genre of crappy, campy b'rated horror, accept they aren't good! Do yourself a favor, save 4 hours for something better..."
5,Perfect,These cant be beat for the price. I really like these sandals and would likely purchase them again. They fit well and were supportive.
1,Used Proxima in Good Condition - depends on what you think good is,The Proxima X350 Portable LCD Projector came with a carrying case and more than just the essential chords. I was extremely impressed except for the fact that a fan was not working and it would continually shut off about 2 minutes after you powered up. Good condition is always in the eye of the vendor. What is their definition of good condition?
1,"Only giving it one star, because I can't give it zero stars!!","Sorry I ever laid eyes on this turkey!Absolutely could NOT get it to work, so I stuck it on EBay.Person who bought it asked for a refund...She couldn't make it work, either!Don't waste your time or money, buy a Logitech Harmony instead!"
4,Good Value,Works as advertised. You will have to have a gadget brain. This is a huge heavy remote. I really do not use it much as I have not been able to get it to do what i want. not easy to use in darkened rooms. I think this would be great in the living room not the bedroom where i need it.
4,How soldiers thought about WWII.,"I thought this was an interesting account of World War II. My Dad didn't fight in the war, but my uncle did. He was a combat engineer which meant he built bridges and demolished barriers to transportation. He was probably a rear echeleon type. This book builds on my knowledge of what the actual fighting soldier felt in World War II. Many sypathized with their enemies as opposed to the rear echelon soldier who hogged the glory but did no fighting. This book has an interesting and important perspective, and I thought that the inclusion of soldier comments made it a stronger book.Overall, this was a solid read on WWII. I think it shows the suffering of the front line soldier and how they felt about the conflict."
4,They just don't make them like this anymore,"W&W is action packed, knife throwing, potion drinking, 1980's video gaming fun. Well to me anyway. They really don't make video games like this anymore. Miss some of the old graphics. Played this game years ago. I bought a refurbished NES a couple of years ago and got tired of only having one game. Wish that a new version could be done for the Wii."
2,Burned by scanner ribbon dragging,"Well-I was happy with the printer, the fax-and i thought the scanner-but overtime just as another reviewer reported the ribbon cable starts to leave a smear on the bottom of glass. Don't buy this printer for scanning"
1,No longer support the new Mac OS's for scanning. It's print only!?!?!,"I've decided that I don't like HP products anymore. They always let me down in some way:* Bad printer software.* Ink out all the time.* Broken HP camera.* I had an HP 17' laptop with a 10-key; Sold it, was too time consuming to maintain it.* HP All-in-One printers (PSC 2110v) no longer support the newest Mac OS's for scanning. It's print only!?!?!?!?!"
1,Bad software,"After two days of installing uninstalling, upgrading the BIOS and spending untold time with the online support, I finally threw in the towel and returned the unit. Could never get the scanner to communicate properly with the computer. Scanner refused to function, although the printer and copier worked fine. Very frustrating experience. I will not buy HP again."
1,"Terribly, Terribly disappointed","I have been a fan of Joan Wolf's regencies for many years. I spend hours in book stores looking for her old ones (The Rebellious Ward, A London Season, His Lordship's Mistress, etc.) and have found most of them. When she started her regencies again with ""The Deception"", I was thrilled and wait with baited breath for each new one.Someday Soon is just not in the same class, however, as ""The Guardian"", ""The Arrangement"", ""Golden Girl"", ""The Gamble"", ""The Pretenders"". I agree ... that the character development of the hero and heroine is shallow. The development of their relationship was even worse. It was hard for me to care about either one of them, or to believe that they cared about each other.I'm not sure why she abandoned the first person narrative convention that she used in the other books in this series, but it did not help the character or plot development at all.Also, what does this title have to do with the story?"
2,"Great price, good service, but not worth the bother!","I purchased this scanner from Dell, after doing my homework and looking at its good ratings, and I especially wanted the transparency adapter. It was supposed to be the model with the transparency adapter, but came without it. Dell would not even acknowledge my emails. The scanner did not work properly when scanning pictures. All scans were yellow and red! Epson was contacted and repaired the unit very quickly, but refused to replace it. It still makes weird sounds when scanning, but at least the colors are OK now. However, the software that came with the scanner is really weird and instructions are poor. Also, the OCR software is totally useless. It doesn't recognize text in columns, so each little section has to be scanned separately.After using the Epson for a few weeks I gave up on it and have now purchased another brand."
3,Fun but pretty outdated,"I've lived in L.A. all my life. This book not only listed many of L.A.'s odder greatest hits, but it included several places I was totally unaware of. The only ""problem"" with the book is it's outdated and several of the places no longer exist. If there's a newer edition you should definitely find it; unless of course you're an Angeleno and would enjoy a walk down memory lane."
2,slight pause before purchase,"i've got a sister who's lived in LA for more than 6 years. i'm looking for a guide to help heighten her appreciation for the place and help her uncover some yet undiscovered treasures. this book appealed on the surface and many of the reviews were positive. sad to say, upon reading some excerpts, i found the book to be crass, bawdy and distasteful, given the prospective recipient.this book is perfect for the cynical, 'porky's revenge' type person on your list. the one who's not put off by bad taste remarks made about every 'recommended' spot. granted, i should have been warned by the title. but i wanted to be educated, enlightened and amused by what i read. not completely turned off. not for the light of heart, or those looking for positive spin on LA."
5,Well worth the price,"Before my internet days, I travelled 120 miles to purchase this CD and paid full retail price for it. Fortunately, it was worth my time and money. The music is very subtle and beautiful. Opening instrumental tracks lead into some of the best solo vocals I have heard. This music is sure to please any Renaissance fan."
4,An A+ read,"The stories in this book are all very good, but ""Promises to Keep"" by new author Patricia Waddell is an A+ read. A strong believable plot, good characters, and a passionate romance with delightfully sensual love scenes makes the book worth buying."
4,This game is good!,"HiI just started playing the game through a second time because i liked it so much.The two previous reviewers critized the lack of AI in this game. In my opinion however, clicking all units and telling them what to do is exactly what this game is about. The situation can easily get out of your control if you fail to keep a watch on all your untis. Very stressful, but fun.The bugs however annoyed me too, that's why i give it a 4/5. Sometimes the mission just wouldn't end and you have no clue what to do about it. Also, pathfinding of the units is sometimes a bit flawed, but this is a problem with most RTS games.The overall experience remains positive however. I always dreamed about such a game and Emergency 2 really lives up to my expectations."
4,"Good scanner, good OCR, poor image manipulation software","I've used this to scan documents for OCR, to scan photos, and to scan figures from textbooks (I teach CS at a small college) for use in lectures. Overall, I've been happy, especially given the price. Its small size makes book handling a bit awkward, and the Arcsoft PhotoBase and PhotoStudio software is simply terrible--I've uninstalled that garbage and use LView Pro instead.I really like the LED light source: there's essentially no warmup time, and it gets its power from the USB interface, which is very convenient."
5,Great scanner.,"I bought this scanner to replace my old bulky UMAX scanner about a month ago. I am very satisfied with this product. As many of the reviewers have pointed out, it is cheap, light, versatile, and works great! But if you are much more sensitive to resolution than the general population, consider the LiDE 30."
4,Ruby,"Ruby Murray was one of the many highlights of the early 50's. It's not hard to see why. She was innocent, proud of her culture, and possessed one sweet voice.My mother liked it instantly but it took my sister a while for it to grow on her. With all the songs about Ireland I can kind of see why. But the songs aren't all the same. My favorite song is the pretty Peggy O'Neil. Miss O'Leary's Irish Fruit Cake is another. It's one weird druggy song. Perfect music for St. Patrick's Day or the afternoon."
2,Cheaply made,"Our three year old twins received two of these cars for Christmas. The joystick control broke on one of the cars one hour after they received them on Christmas Day! My husband ordered a replacement car and then shortly after that, the other cars' joystick control broke! So, now we are stuck with TWO BROKEN CARS and one that does work, but are wondering when that one will break too! I need to mention that the kids were NOT particularly rough with the cars; we were right there when the other car broke and did not witness any rough behavior. The controls are cheap and will break eventually. The cars are very loud, but on the positive side, the kids do love them and provide fun and entertainment for them. I would definitely NOT recommend this product."
4,Fascinating Western,"Andre de Toth's Westerns are always worth watching, because he had such a great eye for landscapes and the movement of horses through them. This story is a bit messy and unsatisfying, but it's still a very entertaining and occasionally beautiful film, visually."
3,"a good phone, if only you could find a battery","the battery for this phone 2401, sku 91077 is very difficult to find as of 6/01. i'd wait until they become available - anywhere. the phone is for a desk only, not a wall mount. otherwise an excellent phone."
1,Beautiful but unusable,"This is a beautiful phone with a great feature set; unfortunately, the constant static between the handset and the base makes it unusable. I too had to return mine."
1,A worthless entry in the 2.4Ghz Cordless Market,"This phone has lots of great features and I was able to get a great deal on it. Too bad for me, because the unit is absolutely worthless. Complaints about static in other reviews are valid. My range for the unit is useless. It is MUCH worse than any other 900 Mhz phone in my house. I'm returning it and the two handsets I purchased separately. Don't waste your time with this phone."
3,lowly worm,"was as expected, know it will be enjoyed by the young lady who will receive it in her Christmas package. Arrived in a timely manner"
5,Great Product and awesome battery,"I have a black fierce beard. This shaves it very good. the battery is very very good. I have had it for a month and have NOT had to recharge yet. It does what it is supposed to do, so it gets five stars....***************************Update, I have had this three months now, and have only had to recharge it ONE time.THE BATTERY IN THIS DEVICE IS JUST AWESOME. A great shaver and a great deal. ..."
1,Britney rip off?,"I think not...this girl is a rip off of Christina Aguilera. 'Forever, For Always, For You' sounds like a cheap imitation of Aguilera in the WORST possible way. Mikaila doesn't have a bad voice but she should stop making music similar to Aguilera and get her own style. Maybe then she wouldn't suck so much...? Nah, she'll always blow."
5,Wicked New Talent!!,"You wouldn't believe it! This girl is only 17 years of age and she is taking the world by storm!! Tali is an untrained marvel. She is sweetly seductive one second, playful and girlish the next. Seconds later, she'll rip off your safety seal with sheer venomous force. She has already made it high in the charts in Australia, now she is ready for the world. I love this song!! Buy it, you wont regret it!!"
4,"Great read, but confusing","I'm not a fan of Elaine Cunningham, but I've read most of her Forgotten Realms books. Somehow, her writing style confuses me easily. This book is no exception, as the stories seem to leap back and forth in time. I'm a casual reader of FR, and certainly did not want to pay too much attention to the chronological order of the stories. This gripe aside, this book is the best work by Elaine. The stories are gripping, and gives alot of information about elven lore in Evermeet. It is one of the best FR books I've read. Highly recommended!"
3,Good book with problems that were not the author's fault,"I really enjoyed the novel, particulary the multiple plots running concurrently. At times, the elves seemed, as one reviewer put it, too perfect. I agree, but on a certain level that ""perfection"" added to the story of how the elves devolved. My main complaint is with the printer. There were numerous typos, the worst of which was the use of a wrong word to start a chapter. Not only did I have to reread the sentence several times, but the initial letter of the incorrect word was illuminated. If not for the printer's errors, this book would have scored higher."
3,elves of all sizes and colors,"The story is sort of a history of a mythical island where elves grow wildand ride dragons and eagles.There are even magic spaceship elves, Gods and fallen Gods.The long history all revolves around the final episodeof an invasion by rebelling Gold elves against the ruling silver ( Moon) elves.This book has black ( drow) and green and even mer-elves or sea elves.I kind of enjoyed the book, but like many fantasies of this type, it is more about fantastic adventures of swords and sorcery than anything else.I don't think that inventing a fictional mythology for elvesis going to make this long story a beloved book."
5,"Yes, yes, YES!","BY FAR the best Forgotten Realms book out there, source book or novel. EC takes her previous characters (you may want to read those first) and weaves them lightly through the myths, legends, and truths of the Elven peoples.The novel begins with the story of the Seldarine and Araushnee's trechery. This sets the tone for the wars to come among the elves of Faerun. The novel brings elves of Faerie to the northern edges of the Sword Coast back in the Time of Dragons, describes the mentality of certain Southern Dark elves in power, and leads through the Crown Wars, the creation and claiming of the Moonblades, and the founding, life, and near-destruction of Evermeet in compelling prose.Because of SO much lore packed into one book, if may be confusing to people new to Faerun's elven lore. (...)One odd note... I didn't get a copy of this until after September 11. The description of the two towers of the Sun and Moon being shattered touched me in a way that EC never could have predicted."
2,Hard to fill. Makes a mess.,"Once filled an placed in the freezer it will, as expected, make nice little blocks of ice. Unlike others, I have no issue with removing the finished cubes.The hard part is that initial filling and placing. Each 'pocket' has walls that go the full height of the tray, meaning that water cannot flow between each cube to fill them evenly without also running over the sides and out of the tray. Once it is filled, the flexibility of the tray makes it hard to manipulate onto the shelf of the freezer without flexing the tray and causing water to spill out.I've found the best method is to place the tray on some kind of rigid surface (I use a small cutting board) and then filling each cell individually from a liquid measuring cup that has a spout. I aim for getting them filled to about 1/8"" below the top of the tray, and then I place the whole assembly--cutting board and all--on the freezer shelf until they've set.A lot of work just to get well-proportioned ice."
1,Don't purchase,"Not worth the price at all. Very hard to get them into the fridge, and when you try to empty them, it is impossible. They are not cheap, big waste of my money."
1,I can't get the ice out!,It's near impossible to get the ice cubes out. My friend bought one that makes smaller cubes and said that was easier to get the cubes out.
1,Terrible Chemical Smell,"Trays started out great, but then started to have a terrible chemical smell, similar to other reviews. Wouldn't recommend these to anyone."
5,yogurt cubes,I freeze yogurt in these for my morning shakes. They are easier to empty if you don't fill them all the way. Works better than plastic ones though. I put two cubes in each shake.
5,Perfect cube for scotch and everything else,These cubes are just the right size to sit two right in the bottom of a proper scotch glass...wait for it...side by side! Normal ice cubes are shaped oddly and will either end up with one on top of the other or melt too quickly. Not these as they fit perfectly and melt evenly.They are also ideal for all other beverages which require ice.
4,Great but difficult to remove cubes,"The product works as advertised, creating perfect little cubes of ice. The only flaw: it's very difficult to remove the frozen cubes. Even going one at a time, I about gave myself frostbite. If there's a trick to it, they should note it on the package."
2,Chemical taste,"I like these trays for everything except the chemical taste. It took me a while to notice it (maybe after a month or two of use) because I usually would freeze broth and add the broth cubes to foods, so the food masked the funny taste. Recently I heated up some cubes by themselves and noticed a funny smell. I tasted the broth and there was a definite chemical flavor.I repeated this twice with a new tray, using plain reverse osmosis water, and still got the funny chemical taste. It's not quite anything I recognize (not soap taste or anything) so my guess is the silicone.I probably won't be using these anymore."
2,perfect cubes but VERY hard to get cubes out.,"Love the way the cubes look but man what a pain to have to push each cube out and freeze your fingers off. Even after running lukewarm water over it, very hard to get cubes out. Went back to regular hard plastic trays."
2,"nice cubes, but hard to remove and initially smelly ice","pro- cubes are big and square, cool lookingcon- difficult to remove from tray- notice most trays have angle sides so cubes pop out. straight sides create more friction, so a bit more fussing to get them out.con- the first 4 or 5 or 6 batches of ice smelled of the rubber - takes a while but the weird odor does go awayconclusion- if perfectly square cubes are what you want- this is the product. just don't use a brand new one for your party or it will make your drinks taste funny. otherwise go with a cheap plastic tray for 1.50 at Target"
5,Awesome...,These trays are worth the extra money. Easy to take ice cubes out and perfect. Definately will buy me and recommend. Not as bulky as traditional trays and stack nicely.
3,Cute but needs design improvement,"These trays do make square cubes. If you only want one or two to plop in a drink without the others coming out also this is the tray for you. However, if you want to freeze a bunch and get them all out now. Consider another tray. Also, these trays need to have a way to fill them quickly with, say puree or juice where the liquid is directed into the square holes rather than easily going over the sides before the thing is filled up."
3,silicone ice trays,At first I was impressed with the novelty of the item. They are actually very difficult to remove from the trays. Ther is not direction as to how to remove the cubes and one has already ripped through the silicone.
3,"Neat trays, but they leave a slight undesirable flavor in the ice","At first the ice cubes were very hard to get out and we had to run hot water on the bottom, but it seems easier now, maybe it is because we have adjusted. I like the fact that you can (must) remove the cubes individually because I can plop them right into my glass one by one, as opposed to a hard plastic tray that empties all or nothing, therefore they are great if you don't have room for an ice cube bin. BUT we have noticed a flavor to the cubes-a rubber flavor due to the scent of the material. I do enjoy the perfect square cubes, though."
1,"Great cubes, but picks up odors.",The trays smelled funky right out of the packaging and pick up the flavor of anything that gets put into the freezer with them. No amount of washing gets the smell out. I'm not really sure these are truly food grade as all my other silicon products don't have this issue at all. I would not have purchased these knowing what I do now.*For the record I've switched back to using regular hard plastic trays and even after sitting in the freezer for a couple weeks the ice doesn't pick up any noticeable flavors.
2,there is a bad smell,"at first, i was really exited to get a healthy ice tray for my family but after using this item for a few months there was a bad smell from the silicone. the smell smelled like some kind of chemical. so i had to throw them away. i think it was very disappointing that there was something wrong with this product. since then i have been worrying that other silicone ice trays might have the same bad smell."
3,cookgirl21,I had bought these ice trays thinking that since they are silicon the ice would slide out really well and the truth is that they do not. The ice is harder to get out than most ice trays that you pay 50 cents for. The ice cubes are large and do melt slower than smaller ice cubes but they are still a pain to get out and are not worth the hefty price tag for 2 ice trays. Find something better or just buy a portable ice maker for $100.
1,Nasty Organic-Chemical Smell and Taste -- Useless,"Perfect cubes were my dream. Had high hopes for these. I procrastinated buying these for 3-4 years, I think. The anticipation was awesome. Bought two trays. Sure it made the ice more cubical in shape and, just as common sense made me expect, I dealt with the hassle of pushing out the cubes. So far. so good.Yuck! The weird, offensive flavor and odor it infused in the cubes ruined my beverage. I actually felt like it could give me cancer. These ice cubes might taste good to a robot -- certainly not a human.The product was a brilliant idea, but utterly failed in its primary function: making ice. Instead, it made frozen chemical blocks.If I could have given it less than one star, I would."
3,Not what I was hoping for,"Cubes are different from the norm, but I was hoping that their size would be much bigger. These cubes are relatively small and somewhat hard to get out of the tray, especially at the corners. Overall they are ok, but I wouldn't buy again."
2,overrated,"I thought that these would be really easy to use...that's what the product claims. But, it's a real pain to get the ice cubes out of these trays. They were pretty pricy, so I am disappointed that these ""perfect"" trays are really not user friendly at all. Don't waste your money."
5,These things are great!,"They work exactly as they are purported to. No, you can't just twist them all out. Yes, they come out uniform, solid, and perfect every time. Weigh the choice yourself and decide whether you'd like to keep one of these on hand for flair on occasion whilst using your regular old trays for bulk ice production or do away with the old ones entirely, you won't be upset."
1,Ice Trays are Useless,"I thought these would be great due to arthritis is my thumb, but I was WRONG! The cubes are great if you don't mind having to support them while transferring water-filled trays to the freezer, and spending all your time pushing the ice out of the tray one cube at a time! What a useless ice tray!"
5,Great for freezing broth,"Love this addition to my kitchen! We often freeze homemade broths for future cooking use. I now freeze the broth in these trays, then move the frozen cubes into a zip baggie. Since each cube is holds an ounce of liquid, we can grab as many cubes as we need to add to a given recipe. No need to prethaw them, since they'll melt quickly enough when added to a hot saucepan. The flexibility of the silicone does make the trays a little more challenging to use -- I am sure to put them on a flat tray in the freezer to avoid spills. However, if you enjoy using other silicone bakeware, you know this comes along with the benefit of easy storage, cleaning, emptying of cubes, etc."
3,not crazy about them,"The problem with these trays is that it's harder to get the ice cubes out of them compared to conventional trays, and since the cubes are the same size, there really isn't a benefit. Well, it is easier to get one cube out at a time, where with regular trays you have to dump them all out at once. I prefer the larger cubes that Tovolo offers."
4,Silicone Ice Cube Tray,"This is definitely green! The color on the page is pretty close to what you get. And you get true cubes with this tray, rather than rectangles. I'm not sure why that matters, but I like that ice cubes are actually cubic. I was a bit apprehensive about having a ""floppy"" tray full of water, but the sides are actually pretty strong. As long as you don't overfill the tray itself, you are about as likely to spill with this tray as with a plastic tray.The only problem, and the reason for four rather than five stars, is that there are no channels built at the top where excess water can flow from one cube spot to the next. Hence, you have to fill every cube individually, rather than tilt the tray down to let it fill quickly from the faucet. Though this is a bit annoying, we don't often totally empty an ice cube tray and so are usually only filling a few cubes at a time."
4,Easy to get out,"Silicon, which I didn't realize at first which made them really easy to get out, and they make nice big square ice cubes, but some family members were conserned they left a film on the cubes, I didn't notice. However if your use to the material you'll love these"
1,Avoid this product,I was unable to get ice cubes out even after pouring water over the bottom. I decided to go back to my old trays.
1,Toxic taste & Odor that cannot be washed away,"At first I thought these trays were a great idea. I thought I might even use them for baby food. I am so happy I didn't start doing that yet. It turns out after washing them a variety of ways, they smell and leave a terrible taste in the ice cubes. I can only imagine that it is a toxic chemical that is being emitted. I sincerely hope Amazon stops selling this terrible merchandise. I would hate to see a baby get poisoned from this!"
4,Perfect for freezing homemade baby food,"I bought these when I made the decision to make my son's baby food, because I figured it would be easier to remove the food after it was frozen with a flexible ice cube tray rather than a rigid one. So far, they've been great. The only complaint I have, which wouldn't be a problem for someone using them to make ice cubes, is that they are rather hard to clean. All in all, I would purchase these again."
1,Terrible rubbery taste,"I do not recommend these ice cube trays. No matter what means I have tried, i.e., dishwasher cleaning, vinegar, baking soda, vodka -- nothing works. A powdery white film develops as the cube melts in the glass as well as a disgusting bad taste -- sort of rubbery.I bought 7 of these and they are a disappointing product."
4,Excellent product,These ice trays are fantastic. The square nature of the cubes result in them lasting a long time in the glass. The only feature that keeps this from being a five star product is the initial problems in getting the cubes out of the trays. This problems are minimized as you use the trays and the bottoms become used to being manipulated.
1,horrid taste,I thought something was wrong with my teeth ie a crown had come loose or whatever. I cannot get this taste out of my mouth. I am so angry i ordered these without reading the reviews.In the trash. I have silicone trays from both Ikea and Crate & B and they are fine.Waste of time and money.
4,Good product,Works great- nice and sturdy unlike similar productsCubes are easy to remove and it is nice that its dishwasher safe
4,Takes longer to freeze than regular ice cube trays,"I read several reviews on this product and noticed that while most people mention the need to use 2 hands when handling the tray with water in it, they did not say that it takes a lot longer for the water to turn into ice cubes than ""normal"". I've had these for a couple of years and have had no problem with odor. I do like that fact that they take up a lot less room than other trays (I have four of them and stack them up) and all the cubes come out nicely (no shards), but you'll have to figure out your own technique. Love the colors. Be careful when ordering them online. One site was charging $24 dollars PLUS shipping. God bless Amazon!"
1,Ew. Don't buy. Gives off a Horrible taste,Boight these to make baby food. I tried a cube of food and it tastes bad!!! Washed several times. Smells weird too
5,"bought it for baby food, but love it for ice","I bought this for when I start making baby food (in about a month or so) but have been using it for ice for about a month. I absolutely love it. They stack really well, and the ice pops out so easily. Also, they make the perfect size ice cubes for drinks. I love, love this ice tray."
4,ICE CUBE TRAY,"NEVER SAW AN ICE CUBE TRAY LIKE THIS ONE. MAKE LARGE CUBES, AND IT'S RUBBER-EASY TO REMOVE CUBES. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT."
1,Don't waste your money.,"Tovolo Perfect Cube Ice Tray, Set of 2, Dark BlueI bought these trays because I was sick of the ones that came with my refrigerator breaking up all the ice cubes into pieces when you tried to take them out.I wish I would have read some of these comments.I agree....they are....1. too hard to get out...they come out in nice squares but your fingers are numb from trying to pop them out.2. no matter how many times you use them, or wash them...I seem to keep getting powdery white stuff on them where they come in contact with the plastic.3. Yes...mine to are giving the ice water a weird flavor...I think it is that powdery stuff...cuz when I put the ice in the glass and run water over the cubes a few times and pour it out...the powdery goes away and there is no bad taste.I just went to Walmart and bought some 1.97 each...Rubbermade ice trays...hope they are better."
4,Using for homemade baby food.,I like that the silicone makes it easier for popping out blocks of homemade baby food than I found with traditional ice trays. I had to be creative in ways to keep them flat in the freezer though since they're so pliable with liquids in them though.
1,Nothing but mechanical problems,"18 months ago I purchased this....4 months later I had to return it to HP because of a horrible clicking noise and the print carriage sticking for no reason. They sent me a replacement, and only exchanged problems. This one the scanner mechanism will stick when turning it on and makes a horrible noise and won't work. Sometimes it will unstick itself, but I am at it's mercy. Two printers in 18 months, now they have discontinued, so I can either purchase a refurbished model at a discount, or buy a brand new ""something"" I stuck with HP since my first printer which is 10 years old still works. This printer is amazing WHEN it works, but unreliable at best."
2,"Scanner ribbon streaks glass over time, ruining the scanner","In case anyone is considering buying this printer used and finds this review this while doing research, I would like to point out some major flaws: (1) Over time the white ribbon cable for the scanning element under the glass rubs against the glass, creating a series of streaks that will ruin all scans wider than a few inches. The ribbon is offset to the side, so you are left with a few inches of usable space on the flatbed that isn't streaked, except for the second complaint: (2) In addition to the giant streaks in the glass caused by the ribbon cable, this unit also seems to be poorly sealed. There is a great deal of dust and dirt on the back side that can not be cleaned without trying to take the scanner apart (which I have not yet tried to attempt).If you are looking at buying this used, I would look for those problems before making a purchase.-Lewis"
1,software problems,"I was really excited to get this machinge, however after an entire non productive working day of trying to install the software and waiting for and working with HP tech service, I gave up. Despite having the recent version of Windows installer, this software didn't install properly on Windows ME...nor will it uninstall the components that did make it to the hard drive. I read an earlier review about this problem before I bought it, but was swayed by the positive feedback of others. Beware of this product if you have Windows ME - this is beyond annoying. Tech did note that they have had problems with this - I'd say they still do!"
2,Mac Booke???,"I am a die hard Nora Roberts fan and she is an automatic buy for me, but I was not impressed with this trilogy, least of all the second installment: Heaven and Earth. Had I never seen Julia Roberts' movie ""Sleeping with the Enemy"" I would have LOVED ""Dance Upon the Air"" - but at this point one of those two is an absolute copy of the other. As to Heaven and Earth ... how could Nora not have noticed she named her romantic lead after a computer - Mac Booke???? Ripley too was almost cartoonish in how over the top she was and it was hard to root for her. I just started the last book Face the Fire and I'm much more excited about it."
5,Heaven and Earth,Great book. Nora Roberts never disappoints. I would definitely read this book and of course read the entire trilogy. I will be reading the trilogy all over again !
5,Wonderful as always,Great read from Nora once again. Bought it for my Kindleso I can move a lot lighter!
3,Three Sisters Island Trilogy,"I read the entire trilogy. I love Nora Roberts and her writing is exceptional. These books are no exception. Her gifted storytelling carries through each and every book. My only compaint - the concept is just a little too far-fetched. I mean, really, WITCHES! And, all the people around them who experience their ""power"" behave as though it is the most normal thing in the world. I can't imagine behaving normally if a black wolf charged out of a bog and then vanished into thin air. I also would have liked a little more sexual suspense and less thinking. All in all though, a good read. And, I will keep reading Ms. Roberts because of her extraordinary talent."
2,"a reader from wantagh,ny","I finally finished this book. i love NOra Roberts books and have read and enjoyed most of them,but this one really took a lot of time and effort to get through. I justcould not get to the point that I liked Ripley, and couldn't understand why anyone else would either, least of all Mac. She came off like a cartoon charactor that just was annoying. I think Nora could have found a better way to portray a main character without making her look like a clown. I would have liked to have seen the story of the three witches be a little more developed, and less time chatting about Ripleys preoccupation with sex. I'll read the next one to finish the series but I'm almost afraid of how that one will be."
2,Nothing like the first,I was so looking forward to reading this book once I read the first in the series.. but this is terrible.. it takes forever to get through.The first book was good because of the suspense.. but this one doesn't have any. The main character is a brat. The book lacks character development. You just don't get to care about these people.But if you are into the witch aspect.. and you like to read about witch rituals.. this is the book for you. It goes into a lot of detail on that part of it.
2,"For Nora Roberts, a let-down","After reading the first book in this series, I was really looking forward to reading this book. I was sorely disappointed. Normally, I breeze through Roberts books in one to two days - this one took me a week and a half. I just couldn't get into it and that made the pages crawl by. Plus, knowing that the sisters have to ultimately succeed in overcoming their hurtles, it left little to the imagination. You know that basically what the challenge they have to overcome is. Not sure that I'll finish the series as this one wasn't worth what it cost.If you choose to pick this book up, be prepared for a long read."
3,Disappointing,After reading the first in this Trilogy I was compelled to read the second book. I was disappointed to the point of boredom. The storyline was shallow and basically did not differ to the 1st book. I won't read any more of this author. Still in saying that if you want a simple read with not brain power required then this is the book for you.
3,Three Sisters Trilogy is just so-so,"These books have received outstanding reviews, but they just didn't do it for me. I've read plenty of supernaturally-themed novels, but the witchcraft in this one was just hokey. I also thought the three main female characters were stereotypes and became even more one-dimensional as the trilogy continued (Nell is kind and nurturing, Ripley has a chip on her shoulder, Mia is fierce and independent). I probably wouldn't judge this so harshly if the other reviews weren't glowing. I haven't read anything else by Nora Roberts, choosing instead to start here because they are so highly rated. Now I'm nervous to read her newer stuff."
2,Reply is an Annoying Heroine,"I enjoyed Dance upon the Air, Nell was a believable and easy to relaate to character, Mia is self-possessed and interesting with a little bit of mystique thrown in. Ripley on the otherhand, I found simply irritating, not so much bitchy as umbelievabley whinny. I understand that Nora Roberts was most likely trying to write her as the 'angry' the one who needed to learn control over her rage, but she came across as mostly whiney and childish. Not an enjoyable read."
4,Ripley's Story,"This book was good and a great addition to this trilogy. Ripley has turned her back on her heritage and is an angry person. Her brother Zach is the sheriff of the small island of the Sisters and she is his deputy. Ripley is paired with an unlikely hero who's name is Macallister Booke. Mac is a hunter of the supernatural and has more electronic equipment then most toy stores have toys. At times completly focused on his studies Mac still finds himself drawn to Ripley and her prickly personality, sexy good looks, and of course her tie to the craft. Ripley faces her part of the destiny of the curse in this story and some more answers are given to questions raised in the first book. Nell and Zach as well as other island inhabitants met in the first story will been seen here. You will not want to miss this story."
1,not her best,I am a huge Nora Roberts fan but this book did nothing for me. What was it really about? What was so interesting about Ripley or Mac? She is putting out so many books that they are all becoming the same. Well that's just my opinion. I look forward to her next book.
3,"Impact drivers are great, this one's ok....","The chuck leaves the bit too wobbly from the start. I'm not speaking of the front to back spacing to allow the impact action, but the overall grip on the bit. It's possible that if they provided a bit more control via the trigger, this would be remedied. However, I put down a floor of cement board, ran lag bolts into a few ledgers, and forced a few deck boards down, and this tool was indispensable while performing those jobs. It's an absolute necessity for the contractor's arsenal."
1,Dawn's Disappointment,"Nostalgia brought me to this DVD. Having lived through the entire Cold War era, I wondered how I could have missed this movie about the trying events of my youth. Had I realized that this was an HBO production I would have passed it by. This explains the poor acting, terrible graphics, laughable plot and the total misunderstanding of the military mind set and commitment to duty- not to mention the bad language. I wish I could still say that I had missed this one."
4,"Excellent Landau, James E.Jones, DeMornay, Booth!","This is a must see movie. For an HBO production, it could as well have competed with most of the fare in the theaters at the time. Magnificent performances by Martin Landau and James Earl Jones. The plot and setup are well done. Nicely done personal angles between De Mornay and Boothe.As a government employee with some knowledge of how things work in these doomsday scenarios, I suspect the movie is not even dated as regards what technology and ""what ifs"" matter as the plot moves along. The realism is fascinating and frightening at the same time.This goes in the gotta see category."
5,Didn't know about,I some how didn't know about this movie until now. Like to see views of this theme and enjoyed this one. Glad I have it for my collection.
4,Scary wake up call,"I remember watching this for the first time by accident while I was channel surfing and was drawn into it. It is a very powerful look at what could have happened during the cold war, and could happen today. A lot of people have said if there is another World War it would be caused by accidental circumstances or rouge elements. I really liked this movie, decent actors, good plot. It was a scary look a potential events."
5,Great Beginning Read,"The most important part of this book are the suggestions for further reading following each chapter. The chapters introduce and briefly debate an area of contention between Christians and non Christians, but the further reading will solidify his position.This is an outstanding introduction to the debates ongoing and can be used as ""cliff notes"" to each debate. For every chapter in this book there are several books written on that specific subject. Read this book and then if a specific chapter needs more clarification, look to the suggested reading for more information."
4,A good primer for Christian apologetics,"Mr. Strobel's book does a superb job of establishing the historical reliability of the gospel books. It is commendable that this was done without feeling a need for resorting to the issues of inspiration and infallability of the Bible.The only flaw I consider the book to have was the apparent need on Mr. Strobel's part to prove that Jesus is God. Most Christians believe this to be true, but I consider this to be a theological issue which falls outside the scope of the book. Jesus' resurrection supports his claim that he is the Messiah, the Son of Man, and the Son of God. Jesus never claimed to be God, and his followers never called him God (except for Thomas while in a highly emotional state). For a further analysis of the supposed diety of Jesus and other biblical fallacies I recommend Samuel Graham's book, ""The Origins of the Bible - The Facts and Fiction Behind the World's Greatest Book."""
4,Apologetics Lite,If you're looking for a book to prove to you that Christianity is correct this isn't it.But if you've already accepted the truth and are interested in finding out more about the evidence for Jesus being the Christ then this is something you should read. It is a very easy read with great sources from Bruce Metzger to Dr. J.P. Moreland. If you've never looked into why logical people are so convinced that Christianity is the true religion then this is the place to start. Strobel does a great job of tying anecdotes to his chapters and of providing a look at the evidence that leads so many people to Jesus.
1,Manipulation for the Gullible,"Here is the quick review you need to read: This book is like hearing only one side of a debate without the benefit of hearing the counterpoints. Strobel has manipulated the reader into believing he is objective and fair-minded. Yet he never interviews any experts who promote a viewpoint which contradict the gospels! He has a wolf's agenda masquerading in sheep's clothing. Beware! His search for truth takes him only to the experts who ""believe"", and ignores any experts who may suggest to the reader a different point of view. Very dangerous in the lap of the unwary."
1,Where in the World is my Book?,Ordered two of the same books to be delivered to two different addresses. Never recieved one of the books!
3,interesting SUMMARY,"This book is too short and somewhat superficial. That said, it is a good reference work. The scholars interviewed are all of a VERY conservative outlook, and because this book has a bunch of interviews in it, each is somewhat short. The effect, when the book is taken by itself, is a somewhat glib case. On the other side, the main lines of argument of evangelical scholars are layed out, and there are many references to other works. If you're looking for, as the title says, THE case for Christ, you'll likely be disappointed, but if you're looking for a reference work that summarizes one position in the historical debate and points the way to lots of further reading, you'll likely be satisfied."
5,Well written and easy to follow.,"I have a faith in Christ and did not feel the need to try to 'prove it' withfacts. However, this helped me strengthen my faith. I hope to passit on to a lawyer friend who is struggling with his faith."
1,All in the family.,"The evidence for Mr. Strobels arguments are based on his interviews with like minded, conservative, funde oriented believers.Coming to the truth on ANY subject matter following that method of investigation would be like interviewing Rush Limbagh, Michael Medved, and Lou Dobbs on the subject of Liberal politics."
1,An embarassment to Christians. There are better pro-theist books.,"I read this book twice. The first time I was a Christian seeking reinforcement for my faith, and I found it in this book. The second time was a few years later after I had left Christianity and began considering myself an atheist. I hoped to be convinced again of the truth of Christianity, but this book sorely disappointed me. The point is that certain mainstream apologists like Lee Strobel and Josh McDowell don't know what they are talking about and are only convincing to people who are already convinced. If you want a book that presents evidence for God's existence, C.S. Lewis and J.P. Moreland do a better job but are still severlely lacking. The most convincing pro-God books I have read areThe Last Superstition: A Refutation of the New Atheismby Edward Feser andThe Case for Godby Karen Armstrong."
3,"A good introduction, but not without limitations","As someone who has defended Christianity against the claims of its detractors, I can recommend Strobel's book as a good introduction to apologetics. However, please be aware that this book does not address many of the points raised by informed doubters. In addition, readers should realize that there is no evidence or argument which will convince both skeptics and believers. If there was, then the debates over Jesus would have been settled long ago and there would be no need for Strobel's book."
1,Heavily biased.,"I found this book to be heavily biased toward the orthodox or fundamentalist point of view. He only interviews conservative scholars. He doesn't speak to or interview scholars who offer an opposing point of view. Though this writer bills himself as an investigative journalist I don't believe he truly does a thorough investigation of all points of view. He seems to ignore or gloss over evidence that would give an opposing point of view. If you want to see both sides of the argument I would read this in conjunction with Earl Doherty's ""Challenging The Verdict"" which is a rebuttal to ""Case For Christ""."
2,Propaganda (poorly) disguised as journalism,"I consider myself to be a non-Christian. I was presented with this book by a family member, and was told that it was the story of a sceptical investigative reporter who set out to research Jesus, and ended up a believer himself. This is also the claim that Strobel seems to be making, but which his book does correlate.Throughout the book, Stobel merely presents the most eloquent and well-reasoned arguments for Jesus; he neglects to give ANY arguments against Christianity. This eliminates the pretence of impartiality, and shows the book to be what it is, Christian propaganda, meant to reinforce believers' faith, not convert anyone to Christianity.I gave it 2 stars because Bible study groups will likely enjoy discussing this book, since they will (wrongly) interpret it as proof for their religion.For us sceptics, it's a highly annoying and unpersuasive waste of time."
2,"The case is not made, the logic is circular.","Though well written. Mr Strobel's 'Case for Christ' cannot be logically concluded since all of his sources come either from the Bible itself, which indirectly Strobel is also making a case for, and people who are unabashedly Christian. It is like attempting to prove the existence of god by saying that the bible says he exists. Then when questioned on the validity of the bible we say it is valid because it is the word of god. Strobel tries to make a case by stating biblical sources when in essence that is the very thing he is trying to make a case for. Including other secular non-christian sources that provided validity for his claims would have helped his case tremendously. As it was it didn't prove anything to me other than Mr. Strobel is a believer. Good for him."
4,Preaching Past the Choir,The Case For Christ is not for believers--though they will find support for their beliefs. Strobel writes to convince non-believers by the weight of overwhelming evidence that the Bible can withstand the scrutiny of a skeptic. He had been among their number before his researches. Well written with an interviewing foremat.
1,Subjectivity disguised as objectivity,"Throughout the whole book, Stobel emphasises that he comes from a critical standpoint and is really trying to find correct and balanced evidence for or against Jesus.However, he only interviews scholars that have no doubts about the correctness of the gospels and Jesus' death on the cross and subsequent rising from the dead.He mentions critical ideas from other scholars, which are then refuted, but he doesn't give those scholars equal voice to present support for their theories. Of course, the logical conclustion from such one-sided research is what you set out to show: Jesus existed, thought of himself as the messiah, got crucified and rose."
2,A case for christ,"If he were involved in a debate, he missed the counterpoints and re-examination of his argument. If you think his argument stands based in the facts he portrays, then you would be convinced that there is even a stronger case for Muhammed and Islam. Just saying....."
2,Too one-sided,I watched the movie instead of the book so realize my comments are for that. I don't like how Strobel markets himself as an Atheist and his wife as an Agnostic when at best both were non-theist before conversion. An atheist or agnostic is usually educated enough to know the differences between these ideas and it isn't just a passive position. As a reporter it should be obligation to seek the strongest of both sides and give a fair debate...anything less is just stacking the deck in your favor.If you are Christian you will probably like this and think it is remarkable. That is how it was marketed to me. I found the material amateurish at best. No real meat to the debate. If you are seeking answers I doubt this will give them to you. The comments here are more relevant than the book!
4,"Concise, yet comprehensive and solid","This book contains a concise yet comprehensive report, full of solid arguments against some, if not most objections to the New Testament and Jesus Christ; his life, death and resurrection . There are indeed compelling reasons why the New Testament is trustworthy and Jesus Christ is God. I particularly enjoy Strobel's interviews with Profs. Blomberg, Habermas, Collins, and Craig, as well as with Dr. Metherel. This is what fat brains are for, to love God with all our mind. These scholars, coming from a garden variety of disciplines; Blomberg, Craig and Habermas in New Testament Study, Philosophy, and Divinity, respectively, Metherel in Medicine, Collins in Psychology, have done well in their endeavor to defend the Christian faith with the blessing of acute intellect God gave them. Let every Christian be trained to do the same and may many skeptics be drawn to a saving faith through the gospel of Jesus Christ as a result."
1,Embarassingly Structured,"I am sorry but this book was so transparantly crafted with an end agenda in mind that it bears absolutely no resemblance to the most elementary scholarship. This book reads like a session in a fundamentalist Sunday school meeting, so shallow is it. I was actually embarassed for the writer while reading it. Not one original thought, not one contradictory view point, and no knowledge of how the scriptures have been didacted over the years was displayed whatsoever. The writer obviously has no training whatsoever in the scientific method, nor is he a competent investigative journalist. Horrible, just horrible."
1,Complete Waste of Time,"If you are gullible and are looking for reinforcement in your belief of Christianity, you'll probably like this book. However, if you have any sense of logic or realism, you'll see right through this subjective drivel. Don't waste your time or money."
5,Great book,This book helped me get started with my faith. Lee does a great job keeping things interesting. Don't have a lot to compare it too since this would be the first book I've picked up in three years. I would recomend this book for anyone looking to get started on an exciting journey into a better life. It was a great first step in learning about Christ.
1,Not what I was hoping for...,"This book was recommended to me by a Christian friend, but sadly it was not what I was hoping for. I have a a strong faith in God, but no real feelings about Jesus, and the book was presented to me as an unbiased examination of the historical proof about Jesus' life and divinity from a questioner like myself. What I got was a book written by a convert looking to support his views about Jesus while pretending to be objective and investigative. Not only do I still have questions, but I am LESS likely to pursue answers from Christians than before I got the book..."
4,A great book that is fun to read,"The Case For Christ is full of information and historical evidences pertaining to the Christian faith. It is very useful for Christians who would like to know more about the truth of what they believe, and at the same time, it is also fun to read. The book is about how Strobel (as an Athiest) traveled around the country in order to question some of the most acclaimed theologians in the country. He condjured up some great arguments which were then firmly adressed by some very intelligent and noteworthy experts on the issues that were brought up. It is an enjoyable book, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in Christianity (Yes, even those who don't believe in it)."
5,So happy to find this CD,"I was so happy to find this CD. It was part of a birthday present for a close friend, who loves all of the early songs of the 50's and 60's. She was very happy with this CD. I would buy from this seller again."
2,Not completely worthless.,"If you want to take pictures, this definitely isn't what you want. Most of what has already been said is correct. What redeems this camera is that it makes a decent USB webcam. So if that's what you need, go for it."
3,why so pricy?,Any bible I'm OK with but for a simple audio file does it REALLY need to be $43.00 !?!?!?YIKES!!!That is just ridiculous!!!
2,Not the best choice,This DVD player did not live up to expectations. I would not play video Cd's but most other portable DVD units will. The picture is really poor. Its has some cool features but not enough to offset the negative issues. I am going to give it away at a fundraiser because I do not want it.
1,USELESS! Waste of Money,"How disappointing. The other reviewers say it all. Way way overpriced. I have always loved Emile Henry products and haven't minded paying the price for them, but these are way out of line. I can't believe Amazon is selling these. Not up to their standards in my opinion."
2,Not worth it,Very disappointed in these earings. Hoops are very flimsy and I don't think the beads are real turquois and amethyst. Some of the tiny silver seperators were missing and you have to be extremely careful because the beads can easily slide off. For $33 I would expect better quality jewlery.
4,Good Basic Fax Machine,"I have owned this machine for about 3 years and have used it as a home fax machine and have no complaints. Are there better machines available? Yes, but for the money this one is hard to beat. A great asset to my home office. It performs all of its functions very well."
4,Music: An Appreciation,"I ordered this book/ cd set because it was required text for a college class. It is well organized and clearly written. I especially like the way the listening guides in the book refer to specific portions of songs which are recorded so that the entire work can be played seemlessly in its entirity, or specific portions can be accessed individually.The only thing this work lacks is impossible for any work that attempts to offer a complete appreciation of music to achieve, complete scope.I recommend this set."
4,good stuff,5 editions behind but it got the job done. had everything i needed in it to pass my music appreciation class with an A+
2,no bad,The HQRP BATTERY Replacement for HP Compaq iPaq 3600 3700 3100 3630 3635 3640 3650 3660 3670 3730 3735 3760 3130 3150 POCKET PC PDA + TORX Screwdriver + MANUAL is very short life.
1,Not worth the effort,"This product is horrendous! The software constantly freezes up, forcing me to reboot and the scanning head gets stuck on the glass. I had to pry open the top half of the scanner and rest it on the bottom to get it to scan at all. Do not buy this product!"
5,When is DX2 !?!?,"I cannot wait for the second one. This game takes First person shooter's and the RPG's, nukes for 3 minutes, turns em a half turn, does it again and ends up with a hit. Graphics are ok, not great, but ok. It is the storyline and game play that make thius game so great. I want to know why more developers haven't followed suit to come up with more games like this?!"
5,Superb!,"This is absolutely the best FPS I have ever played! It's got excellent gameplay which almost makes it feel more like an RPG than a FPS. The graphics are not quite up to par considering it uses the Unreal engine from a couple of years ago, but the graphics are still great. The sound is fabulous. The storyline is about as well put together as a storyline gets.I recommend this game to any gamer of any genre. The level editor is also the most fun thing I've ever used. Once you get used to it you get really hooked. It's also the best game you can buy for that price. Deus Ex is definately the best game. If you don't have it yet then pick it up now."
2,About as good as a foil razor gets - But not good enough,"It's well built. Trimmer works great. Easy to clean, just pop off the head and rinse under a tap. The shave is very comfortable.It is loud but no louder than the average foil razor. For shaving the sides of your face it does a great job provided the hairs aren't too long however... as with all foil razors that I've used it does an unacceptable job on the neck area and below the jaw. The foil design is the limiting factor here and this is why rotary razors are vastly superior to foils overall. Rotaries can be irritating to SOME so they are not for everybody.Its time companies like Braun too overhaul the whole foil design concept and come up with a new design.My recommendation - Try a rotary razor first. If you can't take the irritation then this one is probably your best bet. Just be prepared for the horrible shave it gives anywhere below the jaw."
5,Braun 5614 XP Flex Cord/Cordless Shaver,"This was a gift for my husband and he loves it! It gives himthe closest shave he's ever had with an electric razor andvery similar to a regular shave. The price was the best, too."
2,Not the best shaver for your money,"I've owned this shaver for 15 months. It's not the worst I ever had, but other than great battery life there's not much to recommend it. As others have pointed out, it takes a lot longer to shave with, due I think to the relatively small size of the cutter. I have to go over the same area many times. It doesn't travel well, due to the large AC adapter, with no storage in the hard case. No problem if you're only going away for a week or two, but make sure you remember to charge it first. I had to replace the foil & cutter after about 12 months -- it was completely useless by then. This time I'm not washing it with water (even though they say you can), because I suspect it may ruin the foil faster."
3,"Not a bad razor, but certainly not great","This seems to be a high quality razor, with a nice feel and excellent battery life. You can get a nice close shave, but it takes a while. Expect to spend a few minutes extra with this one. Now I wish I had spent a little more money to get something better."
2,broke first day,the off switch came broken on one and the other just had static. we ended up getting our kids real walkie talkies that actually worked.
3,"A ""Jazzical"" CD","This CD is good for what it is-that being classical music played with a hybrid style of classical and jazz. For the serious student or fan of classical music, these performances will grate on your every nerve. For a jazz player who occasionally dips into the classical pool, this CD will be refreshing."
4,harmonica heat,"as andy himself says, this album is blues,so don't expect any howard levy jazz or carlos del junco tweaks. but andystill manages to break new ground for aggressive tone and flash technique that only a handful of harpists i've heard can match. that tone is like a harp played through a sand-blaster, gritty as anything and right in the face. and the chops and fluency fall just this side of sugar blue. i'd give it five stars except why cuts 5 and 6 with no harp?"
4,good research book,This book gives a lot of information about this tank. Great for all model builders. A good addition for any modelers library
1,Zambia and drugs,I thought this book was really boring the plot wasn't very exciting it was very hard to catch my attention with this book. The girl gets bored in her small little town living with her uncle she wants to live with her father so she starts acting out and taking drugs. He always visits in his rich little cars because he owns his own club so one day she got in a fight with her uncle about how she wants to live with her father. So her uncle says go and so she does she travels to her fathers club to try to get her Father. The whole book is about her traveling to her fathers club trying to find him and while she is fighting the problem with drugs.
1,Sony DHG-HDD250,Poorly designed product. Quality of picture is excellent is you can ever get it to record. The TV guide looses it's information every night. I have to recycle the power constantly just to get the picture back. I called Sony to see if there was some setup that would fix the problem. After waiting for about 45 mins I got a tech that could barely understand what the product was. It was the most clueless helpdesk person I have ever talked too. I have never purchased an electronic product that failed this miserably to function as advertized. After spending numerous hours on this I returned it before my wife took a hammer to it.
3,-facepalm-,"As soon as I read the backflap of this book I immediately questioned how much ""research"" the author actually did on 'skinhead' culture. First off, original skinhead has nothing to do with the Nazis. It originated from 1960s England, and no not from punk. Its roots are in reggae, ska, the rude boys from Jamaica. Look up Trojan Records. And yes, Jamaica. If it weren't for Jamaica 'skinhead' would not exist. I wish the author had used the term ""Bonehead"", its what REAL skinheads call Nazis who have hijacked the label of skinhead. Because to be a true skinhead you can not in fact be racist. Skinheads became associated with white supremacy in England when the National Front began recruiting them in the 80s. Anyways.. interesting read other than the glaring flaw of misrepresentation of a subculture that actually has nothing to do with hate crimes and lack of research the author did on the actual origins of skinhead."
1,Ugh,"The description said it's Splashproof, but when my Mp3 got splashed by water, it just turned off! When I tried to turn it back on, it doesn't let me!! >:("
1,Did not work once,"The first time, I charged it up overnight. When I tried to use it, the battery was dead. So I charged it overnight again. Twenty minutes into my run, it went on the fritz, and began flashing random displays, and never worked again."
1,RCA s2001 mp3 player,"I had previously used a small colby mp3 player which fits perfect in my shirt pocket. Then I crushed it when I was working. I bought the RCA to replace the colby. The RCA player constantly will turn itself off. When I try to fast forward it would often jump to the next song. The buttons are not very good. I did update the firmware, which did not improve the RCA. I bought another colby and I am please with it."
2,Short usage life...,"Got this mp3 player last year to ride my bike and listen to tunes.. At first it was great, worked great for two months. Then towards the end of the bike riding season, it snows here, the power on button became an issue, it became almost impossible to turn on and turn off.Then i shelved it for 6 months, and got it out again the other day and no power. Recharged it to full battery, Tried to turn it on no response. i the plugged it in and notice that it is not holding a charge now.. to the thrash with this junk... good luck if you get one."
5,Noways Tired,"It was a wonderful selection. I thought back to when I originally had this collection some 16 years ago, now I recently attained it again! What a blessing! The music is so beautiful. Songs like ""When Trouble Comes"" and ""No Charge"" make me want to reminisce about old times, when my mother and great-grandmother used to listen to this collection, and I would cry when I saw them cry. Those were the days."
1,confused,Okay I just tried playing the demo of this game because someone advised this. I couldn't play it. It took like 5 minutes for him to close the door. Why do they move so slowly? I couldn't stand it. It's like watching a movie in slow motion. If the game is slow like this demo I will not buy this.
5,as good as seeing them live,"supagroup puts on a kick-@## show, but prior recordings have not captured their true essence. This one does- nuff said"
2,the smell!!,"I should have listened to the other reviews about the smell, but I thought, ""Everybody loves it, and how bad can the smell be anyway?"" It was bad. It really made me sick. I couldn't finish my egg and toast. I had to send the toaster back. Maybe it would have gone away eventually, but even a tinge of that initial bad smell would have ruined the eggs for me. By the way, I don't consider myself extremely fussy or sensitive, but to me smell is a very important part of food. Two other notes: It takes up a lot of space and also, even though I sprayed Pam, the eggs stuck a little in their pans. The concept is great, and the Amazon return was very easy. Maybe I will try the other brand."
1,Liked it for a week,"I wanted to love this toaster as I make egg sandwiches most weekday mornings. For the first week it seemed pretty good. One side of the toaster didn't brown as dark as I wanted, but I could live with it. After about a week the difference in the two sides of the toaster grew greater and the egg cooker didn't cook my eggs. I unplugged and tried again and it worked. By the end of the second week the egg cooker stopped working all together and one side of the toaster barely toasted. Returned this product thanks to Amazon's fantastic return policy. I did not exchange as it just wasn't worth it to me."
1,Poor quality and performance,"The egg part works good. Only two of the four toaster slots work at all. When you have bread in, it waits until the eggs are done to pop them up and the toast is no longer hot. It is supposed to keep the toast warm, but does not."
4,All-in-One Breakfast,"This is the best toaster we've ever purchased! The toaster evenly browns sliced bread, muffins and bagels. We love the fact that it holds the toast until eggs are finished! It warms pre-cooked meats in the steamer section. The only downside is the fact that eggs are covered in water after being steam cooked. We have to dry eggs with a paper towel before eating. If you are fine with soggy looking eggs that dry easily with paper towel, this is a great toaster/egg cooker!"
5,This Egg and Muffin Toaster by Back to Basics is absolutely FANTASTIC.,I have always wanted one of these since they first came out. I just wish I would have bought one sooner. I am so glad I went with the 4 slice - 2 egg one as my husband loves it too! So easy & convenient! I had read reviews about them giving off a smell -- but the only foul smell from mine was the toast that I got a little too toasted! I love this little gadget and think it is the best thing since the Shark sweepers & the microwave! This is a must have item for me! 5-STARS here!!! In fact... I think our kids are getting one for Christmas this year from us! My Sis loves mine so much that she is getting a 2-slice - 1 egg one! So have fun and enjoy!
3,Just OK,Toaster made good egg and englich muffin breakfast sandwiched but as far as toasting....not so well. Toasted one side darker than the other. We tried several different settings but constantly toasted unevenly. Ended up returning the product.
1,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to this appliance and it arrived Christmas eve. Sad to say that the egg poacher did not work in spite of following all directions. My husband even tried it, to no avail. The toaster worked well, but the egg part did not.This item ships from Polsteins Home&Beyond; and here is what has transpired in trying to have a shipping label sent to me:1. Called Jan 3 and spoke to CS (which is a feat in itself) since when you call, there are usually people ahead of you and it is difficult to talk with a rep. After two times of hearing the voice mail message, the system hangs up on you. - Nice customer service!2. The rep told me that I would receive a label via e-mail within 24-48 hours - never happened.3. I called again today, Jan 7 and left another message to have them call me.Unimpressed with this company and their customer service."
5,Really a pleasent suprise,"This toaster is so cool. I am watching my weight and making fat free eggs in the machine is so easy, and they are ALWAYS perfect.Its the strangest thing and I LOVE IT!"
2,What you get is what you paied for!,"First I should say that the egg pouching thing is a cool addition and it works fine.But my main problem with this toaster is that it's power settings (the nobs that you set to color of your toast with) are not as reliable as you want. I mean you set it to something and the first four toasts are more or less what you want but the second series are much darker.Every 10 to 20 times that you run the thing you get completely burned toast.Over all if I was to buy again, and I wanted to spend the same price I WOULD BUT IT AGAIN FOR THE PRICE, it is worth the price."
4,Makes Breakfast much easier,"I have used this for a few week now and it makes breakfast so easy. Just put everything in then go back to getting ready for your day. It is so nice to not have to flip anything or worry about everything getting done at different times. The eggs don't stick, you don't have to use a spatula so no worries about egg sticking to your utentsils. You can even add seasonings and cheese to the eggs before you start and it all cooks up perfect. I am thinking about buying this as a gift for everyone in my family. Anything that can shave off time and effort in the morning you gotta Love."
1,Worst Ever,"I have had his for about 2 months now and it can not produce a single piece of toast light brown. The settings are always different and you can not count on them. The toast either comes out burnt or not cooked. It does not have any heating coils that are visible and it seems that it dries out the toast not just toasting the outside. I wish I could return it but I thought it would get better with use, but it does not. The one star is for the egg making which works great."
1,left side of the toaster non operational,"just got it, thinking no more McD for breakfast! Not so much... The left side of the toaster does not work - the handles will not engage, so i can only toast on the right side, which defeats the purposes of this product. Reading other one star reviews I noticed several people have had issues with the left side of the toaster, so I am returning this POS. Back to McD for me... Sigh..."
5,Awesome Breakfast Machine,"I've had this toaster for about a week, what a great product! No more going to Mickey D's in the morning for an Egg McMuffin, I can make one at home in about 5 minutes. Toasts muffins and bread evenly, poaches eggs perfectly.It is certainly larger than your conventional toaster, if kitchen realestate is a premium you may want to consider the size. Other than that, I give it 5 stars plus :o)"
3,Egg /muffin toaster,Nice concept - takes a little experimentation to get the eggs cooked but with the yolk runny and in tune with muffins. Only OK for two slices of toast as two slots only appear to cook one side as required for the muffins. Manual a little slim on directions.
5,A great introduction to Heart Sutra,"The commentaries by Thich Nhat Hanh use simple languages and fully understandable examples to explain the essence and principles of the Heart Sutra. It is a short essay and is not purposely designed to dissect and explain in depth the Sutra like the book commented by Red Pine. Nevertheless, it is a great book for the readers who begin to study the Heart Sutra. The book is a great introduction and most importantly, one can finish reading it in an hour or two among the hectic schedule."
2,Not good for Begginers,"This book is mostly for intermediate to advanced users. It barely delves into basic modeling or animation. It's good if you worked with previous versions, since they cover new features of Lightwave. So don't get this book if you are starting out. It would be really confusing even if you used other 3d apps before, since they focus more on tecniques and not on the app/interface itself. It feels like it is geared towards previous Lightwave users, instead of teaching you how to use the software from the ground up. Instead, they show you advanced examples so it would be hard for you to understand what is it that you are doing, even though you understand what they are telling you to do. It's useless doing something if you don't understand what you are doing."
2,Intermediate/Expert Only,"Absolutely not for beginners. I've mastered several lower-tech 3D software packages, but I'm truly stumped with this book and with Lightwave. Dan's really speaking to the community rather than to beginners. Workflow conventions as well as modeling concepts are briefly stated, and he relies on techniques to illustrate functionality. That's fine, if you already understand the architecture of the software. If you're already knee-deep into Lighwave, this will enable you to do some really great work. If you're just starting...well, the learning curve is like a brick wall."
5,Is it possible that someone does not know Monkey Island?,"It is strongly improbable that some adventure games fan would not like Monkey Island series. Even the very first game of this package - Secret of Monkey Island - still exceeds lots of contemporary games although it has been created in 80's of the last century.What makes Monkey Island so perfect and unforgetable? It definitely is a great balance of storyline, graphics, music, humor and playability. You will play these games again and again, just to recall an uncountable number of comic scenes, memorable quotes and original ideas, just to see the main hero Guybrush Threepwood, ghost/zobmie pirate LeChuck, beautiful governor Elaine Marley and other characters in action. It is simply a masterpiece of LucasArts and I am not afraid to say that Sercet of Monkey Island established a new standard in adventure games world.Moreover, you will get three excellent games at one excellent price. I strongly recommend Monkey Island series!"
5,These are the most entertaining games I have ever seen!,"These games take you into the world of Guybrush Threepwood, a young man who struggles in his quest to be a pirate, and meets friends and enemies along the way. I bought the games in seperate packs, before I knew about this. An incredible change, putting some of the best adventure games the world will ever see, together, in a pack. Guybrush is sure to make everyone laugh, on his never ending fight against the evil, disgusting, Ghost-Zombie Pirate LeChuck.When you play these great games by the great company, LucasArts, you will have the time of your life. I had a little trouble in these games, but when you're stuck, someone standing around will help you along the way. One thing's for sure, these are adventure games that you'll never forget, and hopefully, they'll inspire you to buy other games from the company, LucasArts Entertainment. This is a must-have for all adventure gamers."
5,"After all these years, it's STILL around!","Secret of Monkey Island came out near a decade ago, and it's STILL the same classic it ever was!!This package comes with all three of the first games to boot, and they truly are a joy to play! Forget smooning over the old graphics. GET OVER IT!!!!! Enjoy it for its humor and charm!! If you can't enjoy it for THAT without overlooking the graphics, then you are S.T.U.P.I.D. beyond comprehension and need to GROW UP.The Curse of Monkey Island, being the more recent of the three, is more modernized in terms of graphics, along with full voice and music. Remember Maniac Mansion and Day of the Tentacle? Well, maybe you don't. But if you do, you'll definitely see the similarities.The conversation between Guybrush and Murray the Skull still splits my side even though I've seen it countless times. Murray is by-far the most hilarious character in the game. He's this demonic skull you meet in the beginning of the game that tries *way* too hard to be evil and repulsive."
2,Not What I Expected,"I honestly looked forward to reading this book; but by the time I got into the middle of it, I was bored silly."
1,How to Utterly Fail Your Kids,"This book made me extremely angry. It should be titled ""How to Screw Up Your Kids."" Her children were hurt deeply by her bad decisions over and over again, and instead of focusing on them, she continually sent them away - to boarding school, to an unwed mother's home and then to another counselor's home, to their travelling father, to their cousin's. She took herself away for ""healing time"" to her parents', to Florida, to the ocean, to visit friends, and all through it her attitude was ""poor me, look at my suffering."" She took no responsibility for her kids' suffering, just said that they made their own bad decisions. She is completely self-centered and my heart was weeping for her children."
1,Disturbing,"A better title for this book would have been ""It's All About Me"". It bothered me very much how she was so cruel to her daughter, Windsor. Ruth Graham told her that at 17 she could not come home if she parented her baby. Before signing the adoption papers Windsor said,""Please, Mom let me keep her."" When Ruth Graham would not relent her daughter reluctantly signed the papers. Ruth Gramham wrote about how sad her Windsor's eyes were while holding her baby on the drive to give her to the adoptive parents. After the adoptive parents left with the baby Windsor sobbed and wailed. Then Ruth Graham related how difficult the next year was for Windsor, but Ruth Graham maintained that she still thought that she had done the right thing. Perhaps Ruth Graham needs to read I Timothy 5:8. She speaks of ""my broken heart"" but never considers how she has damaged other people. How could this be ""Hope for the Hurting""? I would not recommend this book to anyone as it is very disturbing and depressing."
2,Low Grade Exploitation,"Three goons break out of confinement and while on the run, happen upon a all girl school where they take the girls prisoner and basically have the run of the place. A very low budget exploitation flick that tries to shock with interracial sex. One of the cons is black and has his way with virtually every white girl he comes across. Another scene takes place in the gym where the girls have to remove their panties and throw them into a pile on the floor. The VHS copy I owned had a really lousy picture."
2,"A relevant topic, with mediocre support","This is the third book by John Ortberg that I have read. Without a doubt the topic for the book is timely and makes a good group read for small groups. However, the Biblical support of the topic is somewhat disappointing. Also, as the book is winding up the chapters seem to be less engaging. The book is not the caliber of book that I would have expected after You Can't Walk On Water Until You Get Out of the Boat."
2,"Decent Illustrations, but Somewhat Dull Story","Certainly suitable for young readers from ages 4-8, but the story lacks pizzazz. It's about twin sibblings Jimmy and Janet who--while visitng the lady next door--are given two dog biscuts, and they spend the rest of the story trying to figure out what to do with them, and then trying to find a suitable dog to give them to. How exciting is that?In fairness to the author, the story is easy for children to understand. There is nothing wrong or confusing about the story, but as a parent reading it to your children, after several pages of repetitive scenarios/dialogue, you may find yourself wanting to skip to the end saying, ""...blah, blah, blah, blah, and they lived happily ever after. Next book please!"""
3,...but -5 stars for the music,"Like a broken record...I can't believe they took away the original music.I loved this series (I was 11 in 1987) and have been awaiting its DVD release for a long time. I'll never forget CCR's ""Have you ever seen the rain"" in the Decker episode. This series made me an oldies fan, and now that is gone. At least I still have some episodes I taped off of TV.I think it should be re-released with a trade-in program. I was kind of expecting the shows to seem cheesy and outdated now 15yrs later, but its just as great now as it was then. Well, everything but the music. I can live with the video quality (this IS 80's TV after all; better than my vhs tapes of the show, though - its all relative) and the graininess of the low-light filming parts, but the music is unacceptable.Did I mention that I disapprove of the music replacement? Just checking."
2,Tour of Duty without original Sound Track Sucks,"I never thought I would ever write a review of anything, however I was so disappointed with the first season of Tour of Duty whch was one of my most favorite programs (I don't think I ever missed an episode) when it was first released. I guess I never realized how much the soundtrack added to the series. I served in Nam for 18 months 1966-1968 and found when viewing the season one release, that the music, like the theme song ""Paint it Black"" added a lot to the overall feeling of the period. The insipid sound track that has replaced the original driving 60's rock music has made this release more like a soap opera than a window on the Vietnam experience."
3,If They are gonna release also with original soundtrack:,"If they are going to do that, I'm going to buy it too! I already have this one, but I really miss the music. It's a shame they replaced it. The music is part of the tour and were carefully selected I guess. Now in some parts of the series it all seems a bit without the power it had when I saw the series on the network! Truly release it again and shove this one in the garbage bin!Greetings FlorisPS: The episodes are still great!"
5,A must watch series if you were a fan of the show....!!!!!,"In a word this box set is ""AWESOME"" !!!!!! The quality of the video is fantastic as well as the sound.Sure the origonal music isn't there,but if you were into the show just for that you were really missing the whole concept of the series to begin with.This series brought the real experience of the hard times the young soldiers endured in Vietnam.The good and the bad were portrayed in great fashion...The protesters,coming home to nothing,sacrafice,bravery,friendships made and lost.This has it all.My hat's off to SONY for releasing this tight and well done project.I only hope they release season 2 and 3......I'm looking forward to that happening some day.Do yourself a favor and buy this set if you were ever a fan."
5,The long wait is finnally over! Thank you Sony Pictures!,"The long wait is Finnally over! Thank you Sony Pictures!IT was well worth every cent! If Season 2 & 3 will be released I will buy them as they're released! No doubt!Hoping to see Season 2 & 3 soon!""Tour of Duty"" is without a doubt the very best TV-series I have ever seen! Since they aint available on VHS or DVD until now I sure hope to see season 2 & 3 VERY SOON!If I would rate thew DVD's personally I would give them 10 stars, if not more!"
5,Happy Camper,This product was delivered in the time span that was promised and in the comdition that it was advertised to be. I was VERY happy with my purchase!!
3,Paint it blah,"I have to agree with the other reviewers that the music is crucial to setting the mood. Without it, I resorted to humming the theme to myself every episode. Hopefully they don't do the same to China Beach. (Although I can do a mean Diana Ross impression.)"
4,Better TOD with generic music than no TOD at all.,"I thank Zev Braun and his top notch advisers for telling our story right, and Sony for offering it to a new generation at risk. Once again, our precious youth are being sent into harm's way by a weak president, based on lies and disinformation.All you teenagers: buy and watch this before you enlist! And if you still do, God bless you and keep you from harm. HUA?To Sony: I'll buy season 2, and season 3 no matter what. But yes, I'd also like to see the original music, and I'd buy season 1 again if a version with the original was released."
3,Tour of Duty,"Program would be great, but due to the fact it is the wrong code for my area, I could not watch it."
1,No Music--No Buy,"As a Vietnam vet, I loved the show. It's Hollywood, but still relevant. I could relate to a couple of the characters having known similar people in the real world. I, too, join those who refuse to buy until they restore the original soundtrack, music and all. If they do that, they can sell many more copies of this soon to be forgotten classic. I have heard several reasons as to why the original music was replaced and they all come down to the mighty buck. Sad! Oh well, I remember the original--guess that will have to do."
1,OUTRAGE!!!,"OMG I've waited YEARS AND YEARS for a (complete) video or dvd release, and now the show comes without the original period music. I can't believe it! Instead, it's generic sixtyish, umh, music---even when the characters are actually TALKING about what's playing on the radio in a scene! Utter outrage. Do they believe a score has nothing to do with atmosphere, emotions, historicity, zeitgeist, or, say, coolness?!?! Not to speak of goose bumps, reminiscences, memories? Why not change the lines while we're at it. Or the actors! How about that. Brave new licensed world. Know what? Don't buy."
1,One unhappy lady!!!,"As a die hard TOD fan i am desperate to buy this on DVD, but i just can't do it!!!!!!How could anything replace the original music, especially those first few beats of the title'paint it black' that sends shivers down my spine and takes me back to being a teenager when i was allowed to stay up late on a Friday nite to watch it with my dad.....As people have said before, think i'll stick to my VHS copies!!"
1,Overdubbing is unacceptable,"I had to spend some time in Europe for my job, had a layover in France and found a Seinfeld episode on TV. To my surprise, the familiar voices were replaced by French speaking actors! This totally ruined the show - in Sweden they keep the original dialogue and use Swedish subtitles. I can't believe that they would ruin such a great show as TOD by tearing the musical heart out of it. If you don't think that the music is an integral part of TOD, or you weren't around when 60's music was new and fresh, maybe it won't matter to you. I am so disappointed now that I will not buy the series until they use the ORIGINAL MUSIC."
3,Postcards!,More of a description should have been given as cards are not marked for mailing on reverse side. One must draw some lines by pen themselves.
2,Why would they design it this way?,"These headphones are completely useless for watching movies or listening to any kind of music with dynamics. I understand having the transmitter cut out when there is no signal at all, but to design it to cut out just because the audio is moderately quiet is the act of an imbecile.I will never buy any model of RCA wireless headphones again."
4,Damn Funny,"Some reviewers of this movie take it way too seriously.....cheesy but 'realistic' dialog and deadpan amateur acting, but at the same time cool and funny....likable, engaging characters.....this has cult written all over it.If you have a sense of humor, and are a real, down to earth person, you'll like this film."
1,Poor acting and directing,"This movie is so poly done that you may want t watch t just to see how stupid it is. For example guy was run off the road, shot, and thrown in a creek. He is rescued by man actor. Victim tells main actor that he needs a disk before they go to the hospital. Main actor goes to victim's car at least 100 ft away to get the disk. Main actor says where is it? Victim softly tells where it is. What is stupid is that the main actor can hear him. There are many such scenes. But I only watched half of it.I rented from Netflix. They should pay people to watch it.John Will Clay and other Clay should quit film making."
1,Simply bad,"Bad writing, bad acting, bad dialog. Even the blood looks cheap.If it didn't seem to be a serious attempt at a movie, it might be funny. At 30 minutes in, it is just painful."
5,video CD's,"When my husband died, so did the movie night tradition with the kids. The kids have children ot their own now. So, to get the tradition going for them, I got this for a Christmas present. It was just wonderful. On time delivery and all my gifts I purchased from Amazon were in perfect condition. I can depend on Amazon for accurate information before the purchase and service after the sale, unlike other online sales companies. Even when the delivery is from another vendor, I can rest assured the product is as advertised and will be on time and perfect. I appreciate that immensely as I don't have a car and can't get out to shop unless one of my kids comes to take me. Every family got a package for movie night and we had a wonderful Christmas."
2,I love the full album .. this single isn't worthy,Short of including the original mix this album is a waste to buy. There are two remixed versions on it as well and they are not any good expecially when compared to the original.
4,Very Informative..,"I don't typically read self help books, but this was recommended to me, & I've found it to be very informative. The authors speak in plain English, no hard to understand scientific theories or explanations. Christian-minded professionals, aimed at helping people realize their own physical/emotional shortcomings in marriages and relationships- and the little changes in ourselves that make them more successful, happy, and loving. Easy to understand, and Biblically based, we are reminded of what God intended for our relationships, and ourselves."
5,Great book,"I loved this book, it gave good advice and clear answers to questions about problems in marriage. Great advice on what to do when having problems in a marriage in a constructive way.I recommend it to everyone."
4,great resource,this is a great resource book. all marriages should have this tool. we have also purchased the dvd and participants guide for this resource. i believe this can help to save a marriage.
3,so-so read,the first story was more what i was looking for. i thought there would be more lesbian stories. it's an ok book if u like reading about men.
3,Pretty good,Pretty good book ....different scenarios for each story with great details ....but grew bored with it towards the last few stories
2,Erotica Needs to be Erotic,"When I read the title I thought ""Sign me up."" The first chapter was OK but not that hot. The thing that killed it for me was the warning at the end stating that this was a warning to people who think it is OK to act out a fantasy involving extra-marital sex. I'm sorry, if I want to read a story with a moral I will head for the children's section. This left a bad taste in my mouth for the rest of the stories when it became obvious that they were a couple pretending their fantasies.I like to write erotica myself and I have read some extremely hot amateur stories. They left these for dead. If I want to get worked up it needs to be hot, hot, hot and not have the image of a nanny in the background warning you to keep yourself under control and not let things get out of hand."
1,SOOOOO BORING!!,"It was so boring I didn't even finish it. I read 3 of the storeis ( I was trying to give it a chance) but it was basically the same thing over and over just a different setting, different people. Don't waste your $$"
2,"Nice bag, but no strap?","the leather is nice,and the design is just what I wanted, but the strap was not included - which makes me think this may have been a refurbishment. Tried to contact to no avail to remedy.Cannot recommend."
4,Absolutely Lovely Songs,"Although I am an admirer of the fact that Maria Mckee has the ability to consistently shift genres (seemingly) effortlessly from album to album, I was very pleased to discover that this album has more than a little common - in feeling - with my favorite of her recordings, Life is Sweet. Alas, the Bowie flavored guitar is gone but the tone set by the quieter tracks on that 96 album is very much accounted for. ""My One True Love"", ""People in the Way"", and ""Everyone's Got a Story"" are my favorites among the acoustic based gems on this strongly song oriented work. I love the fact that all of these songs have such memorable hooks, but some don't reveal themselves until a second or third listen. And don't let the title fool you, but ""Sullen Soul"" is the most soaringly majestic track on the record, one that just begs to be heard from a car radio on a cool summer night. So if you're on this page already take the plunge and buy the album. I know you're curious."
4,Great Psychological Western (and yes it is in widescreen),"Well I finally got to see this on DVD the other day, after waiting years to see it. The True Story of Jesse James is a great psychological western. You could tell that the budget wasn't very high, but this was compensated for by some wonderful character moments.Unlike what had been listed on this site for months before its release, this DVD is in widescreen. I'm glad that the earlier info on here was a misprint (listing it as full screen), because there is some really great widescreen composition in this film. Check this DVD out if you're a fan of psychological westerns or the work of director Nicholas Ray. Kudos to Fox for releasing this film, and I hope that eventually they release Nicholas Ray's best directed Fox film, Bigger Than Life."
3,A solid 'getting acquinted with' selection,"This compilation is an interesting blend of different songs from GM. I doubt there's anyone in the world who does not know Last Xmas; though it's a bit strange to couple it with I Want Your Sex or Jesus To A Child. As for the first three Medley versions, that gets real boring when listening through. The rest of the CD is not bad, especially if you do not know the artist very well."
2,"Okay litter, horrible scent","I just adopted a new cat, and this was the only litter available to buy in the shelter. Considering I live in a tiny apartment, I figured this would be a good buy. It's not as good as it seems:Pros:* My cat seems to enjoy the feel of it on her paws* It does what it claims - kitty waste is clumped up for easy removable with very little breakage.Cons:* It tracks all over the house. Everywhere.* It's scented, and it's not even scented WELL. It smells somewhat like a rotting orange, especially when cat urine hits it. No amount of kitty digging seems to get rid of the smell. When you clean out the litter box, it gets a bit better, but it never fully goes away.* Dusty.Because of the smell, I dumped this litter for the World's Best Cat Litter brand. I dunno if that brand is much better, but at the very least the smell is a lot better. Avoid this brand if you're sensitive to smell."
5,Great product,"Arrived very quickly. I was giving this as a gift and was afraid that I might have waited too long, I was pleasantly surprised!"
3,hate to write the first negative review but...,"I had high expectations for this saw... meaning I had expectations that if I paid the extra $$$ for the Milwaukee it would last a lifetime and I wouldn't regret it. I do.The first Sawzall I purchased worked for about 0.3 seconds. It whirred once and then died. It never came back to life so I returned it for a new one. The new one works great--but I have only used it about four times and the trigger is already cracked. I think it will still function--but I hate having to get out the super glue to work on a brand new tool. I have not dropped the saw, I always keep it in its case, and I haven't even used it enough to wear out a single blade--and somehow TWO saws have already broken on me.The Milwaukee felt better than any of the other saws I tried, (and it was more expensive than the others) but the long-term durability just doesn't seem to be there... But maybe I just have bad luck."
3,"Not wonderful, just a decent mattress.","I felt like this mattress lost some shape in the middle where my son lies. Like there is a dent there. My son's head also gets pretty sweaty at night, I don't know if that's because of the vinyl under the sheet? Barely fits in the crib I have, which makes it tough to change the fitted sheet."
5,Amps keep going up,"I got about 6 years of homeowner/hobbyist use out of my Makita 12 Volt Nimh battery pack. Original battery was rated at 2.2 Ah. This battery was rated at 3.0 AH so over time as battery technology has gotten better they have upped the capacity in their battery packs. Another nice thing about this pack is that it has a built in LED light that draws almost nothing for power and is angled in such a way as to let you see what you are working on, it also has an on/off switch for that. I did rebuild one of my battery packs but it would not work in the recharger (maybe battery impedence problem) when I was finished so I used my RC airplane Triton charger cost me about $40.00 in cells to build and some soldering skills see this web site www.kichline.com/chuck/fixit/makita/Default.htm overall though I would buy another one.When I took my original one apart Makita quality was excellent inside. Makita internal cells were HD commercial that I have never seen before-top notch stuff."
5,A favorite,My son is a big Max and Ruby fan and when he realized he didn't have this DVD he put it on his Christmas list! He enjoys watching it over and over again!
4,Interesante novela,Hace algún tiempo que leí la novela y recuerdo que fue un placer hacerlo. No es una obra excesivamente fácil y hay que acercarse a ella con atención y sin prisas. Pero es un esfuerzo que verdaderamente compensa.
2,Probably Not Worth It,"This is a difficult book to read, and I wonder if it's worth it. Written largely as stream of consciousness, with bits of narration thrown in to tie the story together, it is very hard to follow. Adding to the difficulty are freely impressionistic and allegorical elements that have highly ambiguous links to the story, and feel instead like the author's own stream of consciousness. The effect is an impressionistic portrait of Berlin in the late 20's. At it's best moments this portrait is vivid and compelling, but these only comprise about 50 of the book's 630 pages. The rest is torture."
5,My daughter is very happy to have it,"My daughter loves it. It is very bright and pretty. It took me 20 minutes to put together, very easy. The shipment is fast."
2,"Decent, inconsistent.","These were average headphones at best when they were working. I bought them a few weeks ago, and they provided me with an average sound quality. However, they inexplicably stopped working after a few listens. I do not recommend this pair, instead spend a little (or a lot) more money and go with Grados, top of the line headphones not listed on amazon.com."
1,Poor quality shoe,This is a very poorly constructed shoe. The bottom of the shoe is pealing off in three places within 2 weeks of owning the shoe.
5,Fabulous Find!,"This is music of the sublime! There is a gothic beauty to this group's singular sound that can only be topped by watching them perform live. I heard eighth blackbird last year in Harrisburg, PA and they were astounding! I eagerly bought a copy of their CD and have been thrilled with the purchase ever since. As an English teacher, I frequently use selections from the CD to use as freewriting prompts in my writers workshops. The students are intrigued and inspired by the unique sound of this contemporary classical group. I look forward to future recordings from the ensemble to use with my classes. Bravo!"
1,Terrible.,"I thought it was a great value for a Delta tool.While unpacking it I heard rattling inside, opened it up and found a bolt and washer for the motor mount had come off. That was easy enough to fix.I did not much like the way it looked on the inside -did not see effective rubber gaskets to keep water from getting to the motor housing, the two belts for the reduction gears appear to be nylon rather than reinforced rubber. But I figured ""it's a Delta, the design should be okay and it was only forty bucks"".Ten minutes into using it one of the belts slipped -had to open it again and noticed a lot of play in the pulleys sliding on their axels. I decided not to muck with it, just put the belt back on the gears and after another five minutes it slipped again.It's back in its box ready to be returned.Delta sure went cheap on this one."
4,Just like a Makita,"Makita has always produced the most torgue with less amps, and this sander is no execption. Plenty of power, smooth operation, and comfortable to work with. Worth every penny."
1,DOA right out of the box,"Can't say I'm too happy with this sander. It was dead right out of the box. Looks nice, but just not much need for a 115V paper weight."
5,Great local music,"A great selection of New England Style dance tunes. Great toe-tapping music - in fact, don't just tap your toes - get up, grab a partner and ""dance like no one's watching."" Also a great resource for instrumentalists looking to learn some new-old tunes."
2,"Nice start, but...","While this is just what I was hoping to see when CableCard availability was announced, it has it's limitations. The current version of CableCard is only one way and doesn't support ordering of pay per view or video on demand. The installation process is a little clunky and takes a visit from the cable company.The next version of CableCard that is being spec'ed out by the cable and consumer electronics folks will support two-way services including program guide, video on demand, and the other services you get with a cable subscription.The price is a little high but you can't typically buy a cable compatible DVR yet. Subscribing to DVR service from your cable company will cost you in the range of $10 -$15 per month. Given the liklihood of technical obsolescence on this product, I think I will wait a while longer."
3,"Good for the short term, a pain for the long haul","Great bag, wouldn't buy anything but a Lowepro... but this bag holding my Canon 5DmkII with three lenses; flash; filters; hoods; cards; it gets to be a heavy load. This is when this bag gets to be a hassle. Your upper back/shoulders and neck get fatigued; you bend down to get a low shot and the bag swirls like a marionette; the pad that is on the shoulder strap will always (ALWAYS) fall off your shoulder; when you walk it will sway.Did a great job holding my stuff for 3+ years, but it's now time for a Lowepro backpack. I know you're thinking ""but a backpack, you need to take it off to get the camera to grab the shot"", but if you're digging for your cam, you've already missed the shot. In my experience, a backpack is the best way to go.I'll buy some ice packs and this will be a 3-hour tour cooler!"
5,Great Book,"I think that this is a great book, it's true that it is very different fron Allende's other books, but is obvious, since this is her first book for young readers. I really like this book, and I personally recomend it to anyone that likes adventure."
3,Great Hair Dryer - Needs Better Attachments,"I needed a blow dryer with a comb attachment in order to blow out my hair and this dryer is great for the price. My only complaint is that the comb attachment got soft and part of it bent from the heat almost as if it melting. I kept having to stop to let it cool of for a bit out of fear that it would melt. Previous comb attachments that I've used were made from a harder plastic. Even with the 'stop and go' technique I used, I was still able to dry my hair fairly quickly. I can see not being able to use the comb attachment for much longer b/c a few of the teeth of the comb are permanently bent. Overall it's a good dryer, easy to use, great heat settings, but the comb attachment isn't great."
1,"No, sorry","Wenderoth's observations are smart, but his writing here is at its worst, and I mean that as a compliment entirely. Joe Wenderoth has written two previous brilliant collections of poetry; what he's doing here in this formless, dull, and not even all that sexy a collection of pseudo pornography I don't know. Check out his earlier volumes for an example of his real talent."
5,Just what I needed...,"Received it in two days, high quality, exactly what it says it is.. very satisfied. Nice paint."
1,BLAH!,"These have no taste whatsoever...no sweetness, no saltiness, nothing! And chewy?? I nearly break my teeth trying to bite into them! I guess I'm gonna have to develop a taste for them because I just bought six boxes of them :( My mistake."
3,Kashi TLC Chewy Granola Bars,"These bars are good, but a little hard. I have to warm them up in the microwave to soften them up."
3,Enjoyable but not Memorable,"Leader Steve Wilson plays saxophones (alto and soprano) and flute on this recording, accompanied by a band that includes Bruce Barth on keyboards, Ed Howard on bass, and Adam Cruz on drums and percussion; in addition, trumpeter Nicholas Payton joins in on three cuts, and these are the highlights of the recording. Most of the cuts on the album were composed by Wilson, with one cut composed by pianist Barth and one by Keith Jarrett. Overall, this is one of those CDs that is enjoyable, but not really memorable. Had Payton played throughout, this would have been a dynamite recording, but then it would not really have been a Steve Wilson recording.Still, despite my ultimate lack of enthusiasm, I must say that Passages is a very good recording that showcases a young talent with a promising future. Keep an eye out for Steve Wilson, who may well make some great recordings in the future. This one's pretty good, but not great."
5,Carols you will want to hear over and over,"Especially in December, it is hard to say that one loves listening to Christmas carols -- we are so saturated with them. But this is one album I will listen to at any time of year, just to hear her gorgeous voice. I also love the mix of traditional English and American versions. Truly a wonderful collection of carols."
3,Almost too revealing,"I enjoyed getting to know Wy, but way too much detail. She goes into lots of nuances regarding her relationship with her agents. Other than that, it was entertaining."
5,Wow!,"Kind of starts lighthearted, then really gets into the turmoil of life. A lot of raw emotion. Whether you live a very public lifestyle or average life you will empathize with the struggles. Some really good life lessons everyone can relate to."
5,Country home goodness,"I enjoyed this book immensely. Just when you're convinced that Wynonna has thrilled you for the last time, she outdoes herself again. At times thrilling, but utlimately a plunge into the depths of one woman's troubled soul, Wynonna is redeemed by her talent and her emotionally stability. The only drawback to the book is that most of the recipes main ingredient is mayonnaise -- which can be delicious, but a mayonnaise milk shake? Yuck."
3,Not Great,"I absolutely love The Judds and Naomi and Wynonna seperately. They have both had an incredible journey in life and are coming out on top. This book was ok. I don't think it was a waste of time to read, some of the stories were very interesting, but it wasn't great. It was written several years ago and a LOT in her life has changed. I think it was great that she shares with us how she used therapy and life coaches to make changes in her financial situation and also in her professional and personal relationships. What I got from the book is that she wants to help us by letting us share in her lessons learned. She's not perfect and sharing her story makes it easier for us not to be perfect too. Thanks Wy, it was a good book."
4,Really Interesting,"I thought this book was really great. It tells you alot about the people and the story, without getting bored down with useless information, but still giving awesome detail into the circumstances surrounding some of the oldest murders in Scottish history. Each story is about 6 pages long, so it makes for a quick read."
1,Makita Miter Saw,This was a nightmare experience. Product was suppose to be new in box. First shipment was damaged and missing parts.Ditto for the second attempt. Don't buy from this source!!!!!!!!Finally made purchase at Home Depot for a reasonable amount without a hitch.A disgruntled Joey C.
2,Blu-Ray locks up on my SONY player!,"All true! The reports that at precisely 14 minutes into Chapter 4 the movie suddenly locks up and freezes happened to my Sony. I pushed the fast-forward on the remote and it jumped to 18 minutes into the same chapter. Not an action scene or anything important to the plot per se, so you I didn't miss anything. Other than that glitch, the picture quality & sound is Blu-ray perfect!"
5,Riddick is back in a BIG WAY!,Transfer to Blu-ray is Stunning. Exemplified by the detail in the fight scene in the dark at the house (just before the Invasion). I see details that weren't apparent on the HD-DVD copy.
2,Disc Cannot be Played,"I have had two different copies of the Chronicles of Riddick and both will not play scene four. As mentioned by others, some discs will lock your player. This current (replacement) disc just pixelates and loses audio around that part of the movie. Has anyone contacted Universal?"
3,"Common Hacks, Convenient Package","I flipped through this in a local bookstore recently while trying to kill some time waiting for my girlfriend. Like most hack books this book contains a collection of some simple, obvious hacks and some that are slightly more complex. Most if not all of these can probably be found by doing a few targeted searches on the web or digging through news groups but the convenience of having it all in one bound book at your fingertips is probably worth the price. This book covers hacks for Mac, Win and Linux with the bulk of the ""good"" hacks for Mac only thanks to AppleScripts."
5,'the NoiSe' review,"Atmospheres and landscapes of ethereal bliss are what you would expect to find in your mind's eye as one listens to the extensive wanderings of the band Frolic. The singer of the group, Kelly O'Brien, has an outstanding vocal persona. Her voice can enchant, haunt and soothe all at once, seamlessly, like a veil of white that gently fades into gray then back again to white. The background scores are magically painted by programmer, Matthew Chinn and guitarist, Jon Beard (who also lends to the vocal aspect of the group). This newest album takes Frolic to a new unclaimed level of heavenly journeys into the unknown subconscious. A must for the ethereal listener."
3,"Sincere, but Confused; and Confusing","Ted Pike here makes a sincere attempt, we believe, to deal with a very important topic, the question of the role of modern Israel in our troubled world. However, his narrative is deeply marred with anti-Catholic propaganda and, at times, nearly takes on the fetters of the Christian ""identity"" movement. Certainly, he appears to be obsessed with things Jewish. In some cases, as in this work, such an obsession can cloud objective thinking.Perhaps the most valuable contribution in Mr. Pike's manuscript is his appendix on the Khazars. Until the very end of this appendix, he was making good sense. But, then, sadly, he fell off the wagon again, so to speak. In all, we would have to conlude that this important topic is to be reviewed with more talented, learned, and balanced expositors."
3,"Beautiful game, but very empty.","Of all the games to be released for the Dreamcast, I was most looking forward to Dead or Alive 2. When I popped the game into my machine, I wasn't disappointed. The graphics are awesome! However, after playing the game for a couple of hours, I was not disappointed, just a bit let down. All of the things that I found appealing about the first DOA were not included with the second one. No extra costume changes that I've been able to find. Nothing to unlock after beating the game, and the endings are pretty weak at best. I even bought the ""official book"" from Prima that stated ""All Secret Characters Revealed!""...well, I've read through the book and there aren't any. To sum up, the gameplay is great and the environments are beautiful, and Jann Lee still reverses everything you throw at him and beats you up quickly. This game is perfect if you only plan on playing with a friend, but it wasn't good enought for me to keep."
4,Dead or Alive 2,"Dead or Alive 2 is the best game this side of Soul Caliber. Itmight not be as good, but it is pretty close! Visuals: Arethese polygons? As a man: these women look hottt! they look like real women.. ""It's sooo reeaal!"" Bass looks like a really huge version of Hulk Hogan and Zack looks suspicious with his ""manssire"" as Seinfeld put it. Control: pretty nice! but could've used the controls a little better. Overall: It's a pretty good game furthering the fact that the Dreamcast is a fighting fanatics dream!"
1,could be useless...,"I will agree that the unit reaches saturation too quickly - the only reading this thing gives is .12 - and that is well after 30 minutes past my last drink. And it would appear to be mathematically impossible to have that high a BAC based on # of drinks vs weight. I also have a unit from Sharper Image, which gave readings in the .015 to .02 range while this one said .12 (Yes, the decimals are in the right place.)I will experiment with it some more and/or look into contacting the manufacturer; perhaps there is a problem with the unit. But for now I have concluded that I don't really trust any device of this type."
2,D+,I read 'White Bikini Panties' and really enjoyed it so I thought I'd give this book a try.I was very disappointed in it. I thought for sure I'd love it since her other book was so great. Unfortunetly for me I wasted my money. Maybe the reason why is because I couldn't idetify with the characters at all. I don't go sleeping around with random guys and I'm not a bulimic.I sure hope her third book will be more along the lines of her second 'White Bikini Panties'.
1,Buyer Beware!!!,"In less than 2 years, both batteries have died. Milwaukee Service just gives you the run around. A dealer told me the drills to buy are Bosch and Hitachi. I'm a custom woodworker who has owned many drills and has never had a battery die on me yet."
1,Worthless,"Received the product promptly, however this puller is worthless and I wasted my money.I tried pulling the pulley on my steering pump with it and the pulling assembly simply broke. The metal is of poor quality and bent under torque. The pulley didn't even move!I will try returning it and get my money back."
1,"Junk, Do not buy","Bluetooth stopped working shortly after purchasing. Holux's website is down and there is no way to contact them. You would be throwing your money away purchasing this device, find an alternative."
5,works perfectly,It works great and I found it having a better signal reception than the TOMTOM original antenna I have.The only shortcome is that the antenna doesn't turn itself off automotically when it doesn't receive any blutooth signal after a certain period of time. I mean if you forget to turn the antenna off when you get out your car you risk to down the battery.
1,look elsewhere,Like other reviewers I've had 2 units as a result of warranty returns. The units work for a while and then the Bluetooth begins to fail to connect on power up. If you have multiple bluetooth receivers it will fail with all of them. The built-in diagnostic light for Bluetooth is simply inaccurate.
5,I read it in one gulp,"""His high cheekbones freeze, and for the first time, I see it -- the wild animal in his eyes boring through, something wrecked, in pain all over. The animal is like a ghost caught in a well for centuries, its cry a soundless wail clenched so deep that it shakes you to the bone."" (p. 238)Just one example of the FBI girl's incredible gift of language. I read this book in a gulp, barely coming up for air from beginning to end. I lived with Maura and her family through seven years of their lives in the span of a few hours and I am grateful to have done so. Read this book. They are a family worth knowing."
3,still not sure,"I got this for Christmas, I really wanted it. Is it supposed to be so loud? And I have the same problem as I see many of you have, I end up with water all over the counter, so then I have to add more... and sometimes it stops, and i have to hit one of the brew buttons again. I don't have the problem with cold coffee though, it definately comes out hot. I'm hoping to figure out these issues, because its really nice not brewing a bunch of coffee when i really drink one cup at a time anyway."
4,LOVE IT!!,"I have used the B&D system for approximately 1 week. I haven't had any problems with the machine. I do admit that it is a little loud. But this draw back is outweighed by the positives. Fast, hot, good tasting coffee. I would like more flavours to be available. Overall I'm thrilled with my purchase"
1,Avoided a fire thanks to the customer reviews,"Shame on Black and Decker! I received this product as a Christmas gift and thank goodness I read the reviews on Amazon. I was undecided whether or not to return the unit without trying it. Today I was feeling like a cup of coffee and thought perhaps my unit was one of the few nondefective ones. This product is indeed a poorly crafted plastic piece of junk. Immediately upon starting the recommended preuse ""water run thorough"" the machine started spewing out white smoke and emitted a smell of melting plastic. Thank goodness I was prepared and watching over it like a hawk. I unplugged the machine, immediately called the 1-800 Black and Decker number, and will be returning the unit ASAP!"
1,Piece of Junk!,"In short, I took it out of the box, followed the directions and it doesn't work. You have to push the button about 5 times to get it to make one cup. It makes a tiny bit of coffee and shuts off. It does however fill up the resevoir underneath, eventually overflowing onto my counter. After many failed attempts I returned it and bought the Senseo brand."
1,Vile and undrinkable!,"Do NOT buy this item!! I cannot stress this enough. Had there been an opportunity to leave no stars in my rating, or negative stars I would have done so. This machine is cheaply made and it produces the absolute worst coffee I've ever tasted in my life. The flavor I experienced was one of resin, and not even coffee-flavored resin, just resin. I tried a variety of brands of pods and NOTHING altered this taste, so clearly it is the machine and not the pods themselves. Again, don't waste your money on this one. BLEEEEECH!"
1,Unit works fine - Terrible plastic smell,"We got our unit for Christmas. The plastic smell was noticable from the first flush. I thought the smell would go away, but it has not even lessened. While brewing, you can smell it anywhere within 5 feet of the unit.I have been on hold for customer service for more than 40 minutes twice. I have left voice mail, but have received no response. I have no confidence that they have a resolution for this problem anyway.If you like coffee, buy a different machine."
1,More trouble then its worth,"I bought one in December. Had no problems for months and then all of the sudden it started breaking apart.The coffee pod holder broke into about 10 peices.Then when I got a new one, it leaked into the brewing plate.I could not get a whole cup a coffee cause it leaked into the brewing plate while brewing.Will not get another one."
4,"Great, once you figure it out","At first, I thought the coffee was a bit lukewarm. I then decided to run the 7oz cycle without a pod to get the coffee maker ""pre-heated"". I then put in the coffee pod and ran another 7oz cycle and the coffee was piping hot. Though the Home Cafe seems a bit flimsy, putting your left hand firmly on top of the brewer while moving the handle open or shut with the right seems to work the best. The humming noise it made while brewing was a bit unusual at first, but now I know that when it stops, my coffee is ready. Its a minor issue, at best. Overall, the Home Cafe is a pretty good item."
2,Coffee Pot,Works good except for with the Cappicuion pods they dont brew throughly. But makes great coffee
2,Its just okay,"I have been following the development of this and other similar products for some time. I picked it up as soon as it was available, but was not impressed with its performance. It made ""okay"" coffee. Nothing to rave about. Using a regular coffee cup, the maker splatters and has significant post drip. Ended up returning it. For those coffee lovers that are looking for the the perfect sigle serve look at Keurig's home system. You can view at www.greenmountaincoffee.com It is more expensive than the Home Cafe, but I guarantee you will be happy! It has more than 80 varieties to chose from."
3,You get what you pay for.,"On average, we go through one of these units per year. But, you only pay in the $30-$40 range for this piece of equipment, so you can't really expect it to last forever. If you want durable construction (read: not plastic) then you must purchase a more expensive unit. If you want REAL cappuccino, you have to spring for the $2000 cappucino maker.That said, we keep buying this coffee maker because: it's affordable, you can find the pods in various supermarkets, and the coffee is pretty decent.We don't like steaming hot coffee that burns our tongues. The temperature of the coffee from this machine seems just about right to us. If you like super hot coffee, then this product is not for you."
1,Home Cafe HCC100,"I called the company because the coffee wasn't hot enough (only 140 degrees). They said it should be 160-170 degrees, and I must have gotten one with a bad thermostat. Stood in Christmas exchange lines and got a new one. What a coincidence...this one also brews at 140 degrees. I then e-mailed Black & Decker, and they said it was designed to brew at 175 degrees, and it appeared that I had received TWO defective units. After reading the other reviews on this website, it appears there are an awful lot of defective units that are being sold in the stores."
1,Poor Quality,"I purchased the Black and Decker Home Cafe and it worked well for 3 months. Then the pod holder disintegrated and I called Black and Decker for a replacement part. The part was no longer available so they sen me a new machine.The new machine leaked water on the counter and not into the cup. Another call and another new pot. This is the third pot and I will make another call. All I want now is a refund, but that is not in the cards.I would suggest no one buy this machine. It is the poorest design and quality on the market. I am not sure what their cost is, but I would think the replacements would be checked better and they would try to improve the quality."
1,DANGEROUS!!!,"I loved this machine when I first got it -- I couldn't say enough good things about it -- I read all the negative reviews and was so naively shocked that others could find a flaw with my beloved machine. THEN, I was innocently brewing a cup of coffee in the kitchen and holding my infant son about 6 feet away when the thing EXPLODED sending scalding hot coffee grinds all over me and my baby -- he started wailing and didn't calm down for almost an hour. This thing is so dangerous -- if anyone is initiating a class action suit against them, post it so I can join!!!"
2,Go for the newer model- GT300,"PROS: Makes a quick cup of coffee.CONS: I went through two of these. Very cheap and breaks easily.I'm finding the specialty pods- Skinny Latte & Cappuccino, hard to come buy. Usually the ones I find on the store shelves are expired.If you really want a Black & Decker Home Cafe, get the newer model- GT300 Home Café.*Note: I also owned one of those Senseo coffee makers. It would consistently dispense the wrong amount of water resulting in numerous overfills therefore wasting numerous coffee pods, so more expensive isn't always better."
1,Inconsistant working order,"I wouldn't recommend this coffee maker. My device would sometimes make a full cup of coffee, and sometimes only a half before it 'sputters out'. Couldn't figure out why. Placing the pods in the machine is touchy, the machine squeeks of cheap plastic as you secure the pod in. The coffee came out great, except when it decides to make half a cup, then it's espresso strong. Nasty. Luckily, I got it at a yard sale for $5, so I tolerated it until I saw a $30 single-cup coffee maker at WalMart that had programming (this device does not). Surprising, I thought Black and Decker made better products than this, so I expected a higher quality device. Guess they should stick with power tools."
1,do not buy!!!!!!!,Total waste of money. I have returned mine twice and got replacements that worked exactly the same way. Will not make a complete cup of coffee. Leaks all over if you leave water in the resevoir(and what good is a resevoir if you must fill it for every cup?) E-mailed customer service and got no help whatsoever. They tell me to return for replacement. I had 3 already! What are the chances the next one will be different? No I just tell everyone what junk this is and vow not to buy Black & Decker anything again.
2,"Good coffee, awful machine","I thought the coffee that the HomeCafe produced was delicious, warm, and fast. However, the construction is so flimsy and shoddy that I could almost never get the lid to close, and one time after muscling it shut, the whole handle broke off. The coffee isn't worth replacing this awful machine for!"
5,"undiscovered in the US, but the best I've ever heard.","A perferct mix of R&B , hip-hop, jazz, rap, and just a really good beat. He is Samoan but raised in New Zealand, formerly a member of the group Supergroove, he sent out on his own to make the album, 2B.S.Pacifc, and this is his second solo album, and hell, its aweseme! To accompany him are the Krates, an 8 piece band. He starts to assert more honest lyrics, and again, his sounds flow gently, powerfully. Che Fu's voice is smooth and never misses a beat. He is popular in new Zealand, but hasn't really made it to the US. My advice, seek Che Fu out, order him from your local record store, and let people know how great he is."
3,What you know is what you get,"I bought this on faith, not having seen much of the series on TV. I thought it would be a cute, funny, precursor to Friends or the like.If you know the series and liked it, then by all means get this; it's certainly affordable. If you didn't like the series or are not familiar with it, then save your dimes. Somehow, it just doesn't work on DVD if it ever clicked on the air.I remember that there was a weird tension, electricity, between the triangle of the 3 stars that seemed to be funny, poignant at times, even sexy. Somehow, that just didn't come thru on these disks..."
4,"At this rate, season 8 will be available sometime after the year 2060!","This is totally unacceptable. Seeing as how it's been over seven years since they released season 1 with no word on season 2, you can expect season 8 to be out no earlier than 2060. They've released far more forgotten TV shows on DVD than this one. Even assuming season 1 didn't sell as well as they'd hoped, why couldn't they release the rest of the series as a limited edition on Amazon only or something rather than force people to buy homemade DVDs off of websites made by amateurs? Since Full House has already managed to release its entire 9 year run in just a few years, you've got to wonder what is going on in these people's tiny little minds."
4,Only 5 grams of sugar. Top rated at AOL,"A great bar with coffee. Most breakfast bars, nutrition bars, power bars, cereal bars, and natural bars have way too much sugar. These Honey Almond Flax bars only have 5 grams. The order was on time and as promised, with free shipping for me."
5,A fascinating work on the central prayer in Christianity,"An in-depth, but not heavy, look at the prayer Christ Himself taught us. It's neat to re-examine the Lord's Prayer - something so familiar to us that we sometimes take it for granted and forget its profound implications.I especially liked the questions at the end of each chapter... they make for an excellent jumping off point for discussions in a Christian education group, or even as a starting place for private reflection.The style is both scholarly, yet involvingly personal. I definitely recommend this book."
4,Spitz and Fishers Medicolegal Investigation of Death.,"This text is a requirement in some forensic fellowships. While in some subjects, the text is out-of-date, in other subjects, the facts never change and provide for a overall great reference text. I would recommend this book to anyone who is considering forensics as a career."
3,Not for youth,"Our wrestling club uses orange colors and I thought this was for a youth, but it wasn't so I had to return."
3,Cliff Keen,"I got the white with navy headgear and it looks like its white with black. The picture on the web site makes it look more like white and royal, which is what I wanted, but they dont carry that color combo which is odd. The headgear looks good but it doesnt match the picture from the website......."
4,"Charming, funny, sensual - until the last 1/4","A Wish & Kiss is worth spending a few hours on. Itfeatures an archeologist heroine who uncovers a nifty little lamp thatturns out to contain a very sexy genie named Alex. He announces his presence to our stunned heroine with this line ""I have come to do your bidding mistress"". How can one not read on? What follows is a fun, sexy romance where the couple spend a lot of time together and get to know each other well before committing. The book begins to drag towards the end as the focus shifts from their relationship to a mad chase around the country as they try to salvage Chelsey's career. Despite that little slow down, the book is most definitely worth searching for if you like magical stories filled with laughter, sensuality and strong characterization."
5,Angela's Review,"So I just typed up this nice whole review thing, and my computer decided to shut off and it deleted everything I had wrote. Yet hear I am again writing another review because ""Everything in Transit"" is just that great of a CD. I bought it today after hearing almost all the songs on it before hand, and its already been on repeat 3 times. The songs are all beautifully written and unique with amazing vocals and of course wonderful piano parts. They all kind of have that early Something Corporate feel to them, all catchy and radio worthy. Listen to the lyrics while the piano makes you feel relaxed or excited and you'll never get tired of listening to it. If youve only heard song from this CD, and you liked it, I guarentee you will like all the other songs also.Best Tracks: The Mixed Tape, Bruised, Dark Blue"
5,McMahon has done it once again....<3,"for the SoCo fans out there who want to buy this album......go right ahead! its sorta like the old stuff, but this is andrews own side proj. the piano in this one is fantastic, it made me cry. it almost seems to tell a story, listening to the songs in order. so, in the end i personally loved EVERY song on the album. but yall should go and check it for yourselvs..."
5,You don't know Jack!!!,"Until you've heard Jack's Mannequin's ""Everything in Transit"" you have not lived. Andrew's great melodies and lyrics are incredible. You listen to the CD once and the 2nd time you're already singing along. I bought this CD the day it came out and in August and I have not stopped listening to it. It is IMPOSSIBLE to get sick of or bored of. Basically ""Everting In Transit"" is perfect."
2,Disappointed,I was pretty excited when I ordered this item but after using it for a few months I'm pretty disappointed. The problems I encountered are:- time consuming and difficult to adjust the board- difficult to line up cuts- final result is inaccurate cutsI can't believe I wasted forty bucks on this when that could have gone towards a basic compound miter saw. Save your money and skip this one
2,Disappointed,"I chose it thinking good movie for my grandchildren......little disappointed / too shallowand didn't hold their interest. No, would not recommend it."
4,Works great...wish the dispenser were a bit easier though.,The PH test tape works just fine and has a nice dispenser with an easy to read PH scale. The only request I would make is for the instructions to inform the purchaser whether the foil is necessary when storing the tape or it can be left off once the tape is opened. Also it would be nice if there were some type of dispenser so you don't have to handle the entire roll of tape in order to tear off a piece for use.
4,Helpful,"This product is essential for those who need to monitor body pH, or even test beverage levels. Well worth the price!"
1,Does not work,I thought this product was for use with your saliva. I clicked a link that promoted it this way. It does not work. I need to return it. If you are purchasing this product to check your body's Ph. It doesn't do that.
4,Definitely enjoyed this gem.,"I found this movie to be hilarious.Imagine if ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" and ""Shaun of the Dead"" had a relationship and decided to adopt ""Lesbian Vampire Killers"" and raise him/her as their own.Now, notice how I said ""adopted.""It doesn't have quite the impact as the parents, but you can still feel the basic elements and will definitely have some laughs if you enjoyed the parents' titles.Enjoy,Derek"
5,The urogynecology book to get!,"As urogynecology faculty at a major university medical center, I have used and recommended this book as a source for residents and fellows for many years. The new edition is even better. I still refer the my on copy of the book on a regualr basis. It is well written, very easy to read, and highly descriptive. This is the only urogynecology book to buy whether you are a resident, fellow, or practicing urogynecologist."
3,An Indiscretion Too Long,"It is always interesting to see the awesomely beautiful Jennifer Jones and I waited keenly to see the NTSC format video (as a PAL format was not available in the U.K.) which can be played on my VCR.Oh but what a hullabaloo about nothing!What was the indisretion?The Italians, of all people, dragging two innocent people out of a railway car up before the ""beak"", who as far as is shown on film, were not doing anything untoward! The whole film could have been cut in half for the paucity of action and dialogue.How could anyone cast Montgomery Clift as a native Italian.Were there not some American/Italian actors sufficiently known in 1952(a latter day Al Pacino) who could have been cast by Selznik and at least spoken some authentic Italian to his countrymen? The highlight was seeing ""Tony"", Richard Beymer from the 1960 film West Side Story, playing a little boy and cast as ""Dick Beymer""!"
5,Loved it,I have read the end of this series and wondered how they started. Anne McCaffrey has always been a favorite of mine and she did not dissapoint now either.
1,great book with too many TYPOS!,This great story has many many typos. Every 3 pages has a typo on it.Examples: 'comuit' instead of 'comunit' : 'zoom' instead of 'room' : 'Dai op Owen' instead of 'Daffyd op Owen' :'out' instead of 'cut'. There are many more errors that I corrected as I read or glossed over as nonsense.The errors interrupt the flow of the story and make for frustration rather than entertainment.This is one of my favorite authors. I may not buy any more of her books on Kindle because of the error rate. The price seems too high for careless work.
3,abstractions abound,"Somewhat of a period piece, using experimental techniques that seem both dated and creative. The narrative is loose, the imagery is dreamlike and some of the shots are amazingly beautiful. The story line is fragmented concerning a young woman's search for love and her destiny using aspects of her astological chart. A frustrating film that i mulled over like a puzzling dream, Tommy Lee Jones appears as a construction worker with a mind for revolution and a heart full of unrequited love.This movie made me realize how tame Hollywood pictures are circa 2005. A good movie to watch with some film geek friends late at night and mull over mythologies of the world and the elasticity of reality. Also check the late Richard Manuel of the Band in his role as a rich composer; he cuts a rakish form."
3,"As an actor, Richard Manuel made a wonderful singer!","This is a curio from the annals of Canadian film-making. Almost no plot, apart from Eliza's search for her true love according to her horoscope. Hmmmmm.Tommy Lee is as you might expect as something of a drifter, for whom Eliza (Elizabeth Moorman) falls. Fans of the Band (like myself) will search out this film for a sighting of Richard Manuel as Richard the 'Composer'. Well, we don't see him compose - unfortunately, he doesn't sing or play piano either. It's kindest to say that as an actor, he made a terrific singer. Probably fair to say that Manuel was playing himself, just dressed smarter. Handsome and smilingly, he offers Eliza wine in his Rolls Royce and takes her to his Astrology Club.Wierd people. Wierd film. Patience is required. Audio pretty poor."
4,outstanding-avoid those bad reviews,"To the ""reviewer"" who appears a few entries before me, and who refers to himself/herself as ""A Music Fan--Great Stuff If You Don't Have A Pulse"": Learn how to write subtly. You have no facility for explaining what your problem is with this recording, but you get right to the point with your hate for it. That's for kids. You can't offer concrete suggestions of what you think is better, so your ""review"" amounts to nothing. ""knob twiddling""? ""machine-driven""? That's like accusing Arnold Schwarzenegger of being governor of California. What do you think this music is supposed to be? Also, run a spell check next time.This is an excellent survey of current Italian and Brazilian club lounge."
5,Way to Go DB!,I just picked this one up and think DB has found a great niche. In fact I was pleased to notice that Malkmus wasn't around to muddle this one up with his annoying overdubs and lackluster vocals. Lyrics are the cornerstone to the Silver Jew construction co. and Berman pulls out some original beauties to expand on his already wonderful repetoire. All in all I think the Silver Jews are moving in a great direction.
3,......,"Corny....but cute for little kids who liked the movie. I was 10 when I got it and I liked it for the first week or so, but the funky beats of the music kinda screws you up and makes you want to bang your head into the wall after the 5th time of ""He Blinded Me With Science"
3,Good but not GREAT,"I purchased this seat for my daughter who is 16 months old. I liked it primarly because it had a tray and was subdued in the color. I haven't been able to get the lap strap to come off to clean it and manuvering it up and down is very hard, I fiddled with it for about 20 mins and my husband took over after that. There is no place to store the tray for travel. My daughter however loves it and thus the reason we haven't exchanged it. Good seat not GREAT!"
5,Super Simple and Wonderful,I have now bought 2 of these chairs. One for my granddaughter and one for a friend of mine. Everyone loves this chair. It is easily portable and the children can use it for a chair of thier own around the house.
4,Love it with reservations,"I had this cd for many years and then lost it. So when I ordered it again, I thought it would be the same as the original. I don't think it is; I had a favorite song on the original which name I can't remember. All I know is that I loved it, and it doesn't seem to be on this cd. I've noticed that they've reissued the original and that it costs a lot more. I'm thinking that that's the one I should have ordered, because it would have all the tracks with which I was familiar. Don't get me wrong; this is a wonderful cd and the music is just beautiful. It's just not the one I remembered."
3,Ceramic travel mug,"A nice looking mug, but too tall, and gets too hot from the outside, and the top does not fit very well on it."
3,Ummm....allright for most metals I suppose,"I bought this to cut stainless steal sheet. Probably not the best idea, but the product info. doesn't mention it as a problem. They probably figured it was obvious. Well, the cutter jammed and broke on the second cut of some stainless I'm using to make a coffee roaster. The first cut was great. Very smooth and easy to work. This would probably make a great tool if you don't try to push its limits like I did. It's cheap and very sturdy once attached to a work table. I'm sorry I broke mine."
5,An Amazing true story.,"Deborah Rose is an amazing person and friend. I met her online two years ago. I admire her because of her inner strength to endure, and to have the courage to write about the abuse of her childhood. From the moment I received the book, I found myself unable to put it down. Deborah is a gifted writer, and accomplished to bring awareness of how child abuse can affect the person involved. 'Ellie' is a book that will touch your heart, and I'm so glad I had the opportunity to read it."
1,I think I know whats going on,"Roadrunner records is thier current recording company and they used to be under Koch, I think Koch released all the stuff that they had rights too, that why anything after Lovecraft & Witchhearts isn't on here"
2,Why do they have the same songs on here twice?,"On this cd they included Lovecraft and witch hearts, which was a best of collection from before Damnation and a day. But why would they include that when the whole cd's they came from are in this?And where are the three cd's that came out after Lovecraft?And... even better, why would I buy this when I can download everything on here online for free? And in that same download I can get everything they have ever done, not just Dusk-Midian."
3,Untamed : Animals in the Wild,"This item was okay, but it had the same exact pictures that were in the big UNTAMED book. I did not realize that it was more of a childrens book than an adult book. I was not expecting this and I was a little disappointed."
3,Untamed,As a animal's portrait artist I'm always purchassing animal's pictures and comments of their behavior . The pictures in this book are good and in some of them very sensitive . The comments are inteligent and I learn a lot of thing.
4,This is Very Cool with Few Flaws.,"Balder's Gate 2 is definaly a really cool game. I am a D&D player, and though I play 3rd Edition, I still see that this is a really cool game. There are so many things to do, and I love the way everything affects some of the story. Also, I love the way they allow you to create your VERY OWN character. There are a few problems, like the game freezes up after playing for a long time (you will be playing a long time, and I have a new computer, only a year old). Occaisionally it seems to take too long to level up, and there is not as much to do when you level up, unlike I would have expected from my D&D experiance.Other than that, though, there is really no problems with BG2. It is a well rounded, fully engaging game. I probably should have given it 5 stars, but I kinda expect it to be PERFECT for me to do that. Anyway, if you're thinking about buying it, you probably should. I had the same thoughts myself, but I'm VERY glad I bought it.Yo."
5,the new order,Baldur's Gate 2 - One of the greatest game i had pleasure of having and playing. The ability to have a party that interacts with you and your decisions is unbelieavable. With a sharp turn around every corner of the story this game is undoubtedly deserves 5 starts. With the great history of Dungeons and Dragons this is a great accomplishment done by Black Isle Studios. If you are a fan of Dungeons and Dragons' games this is a must by for you. ---- Janos Horvath
4,This game is one of the best!,This game is fun and full of stuff to do that you will never be bored. I don't care if people say that its a copy of the first. A great thing about the game is that they bring back some of the npc from the last. My fav has to be Minsce and Boo they are the best! There is a review that I read that I thought was silly. a guy was complaining about in the begining of the game how your trapped and you have to kill the little guy in the jar. first off I think thats the best thing! because that drives me to want to defeat the bad guy even more and the fact that he takes your best friend to jail. Yet let me remind that guy....life back in that time was dark and evil....so pick up your sword or spell book and get ready for some butt kicking!!!
4,Time for the times,"i wholeheartedly agree with everyone who would have wanted 2 discs with all the full length versions. It's also too bad the eddie baez mix of ""I Don't Want To"" wasn't used for this continuous mix. For collectors of long versions, here's how the times pan out:1. intro (1:18)2. Un-break My Heart (5:51)3. Spanish Guitar (7:48)4. You're Makin Me High (8:17)5. I Don't Want To (7:32)6. Hit The Freeway (4:26)7. He Wasn't Man Enough (6:38)8. He Wasn't Man Enough (3:45)9. Maybe (4:20)10. Un-break My Heart (8:28)11. Spanish Guitar (6:22)"
3,"Close but, no cigar","I have to say that I enjoyed this book more than the previous 3 contemporary books from Garwood. But, her speciality is still historical. There is something very charming about the banter and wittiness of her historical books that she has not be able to produce in the contemporaries. I WISH she would delight us with something historical again. Garwood's historical books are the type of books that you what to read over and over again whereas her contemporaries are a one time event. As for this book, I felt she made a better stab at characterization and interaction between the characters but, are we reading about characters or about a substandard suspense/mystery plot? I can't figure out which should be the most important point of the contemporary books because she flip-flops between ideas. Some advice to Ms. Garwood, stick with what made you a best selling novelist."
4,wonderful,I loved this book. The chemisty between the two main characters was magnetic it drew me in. This was by far Julie Garwoods best contemporary romance. I hope there's more to come.I do miss her historical I hope to see more of those as well.
2,An interesting plot....,"... was completely lost in the never-ending ""sexual tension"" between the two main characters. Pages and pages were devoted to her long legs and his sexy eyes. This book really isn't a murder mystery, it's a romance, and not a well written one at that."
4,Good light reading,"I have never read Julie Garwood before but for a free book, this was pretty darn good. I would probably read her works again."
2,Nauseating Heroine,"I love Julie Garwood's historical novels. I also like her contemporary, Heartbreaker and Mercy, even Killjoy's not bad. However, I'm really disappointed with Murder List. The heroine, Regan, is simply too airhead, spoiled, and nave. It's not funny anymore. I don't find her likeable at all. She and her friends acted more like teenage girls in high school. The suspense isn't very interesting and unlike Garwood's other novels, there's lack of real humor in the novel. One of the reasons I like reading Garwood's novels is because it's so funny. The interaction between the hero and heroine's very interesting and the heroine is usually quite witty and intelligent."
3,Good Read - Horrible Audio,"I liked the story, but I unfortunately listened to this book instead of reading it. The reader was terrible. Please, never try to do a New England accent again!!! She thought that by leaving out every ""R"" she had it down pat. It was very annoying and took away from the story. I know we have an accent here in NE, but it is not like that!The heroine of the story was supposed to be strong, but I found her to be naive and not too swift on the uptake. OK for a summer read, but not one of Julie Garwood's best efforts."
2,Murder List,"Boring... I usually love anything Julie Garwood writes but this novel was just plain bad and uninteresting. It had no plot and a predictable, cheesy villain. Half way thru I skimmed the rest of the book just so I could be done with it."
3,Nothing new here,"Is anyone else beside me tired of reading about rich girls?...especially ones that look like supermodels, and spend all their time doing good with their family's money.What is this? Planet of the Barbies or something?I'm getting tired of serial killers and cookie-cutter characters too.Other than that, it wasn't a bad book."
2,A Very Dissappointed Fan,"Although the relationship between Alec and Regan is sweet and funny, it was a waste of time to read this book. This is not a good example of Julie Garwood's talents. I have read everything she has written and frequently read them again. No one can write a historical romance better that Julie Garwood. I even loved Heartbreaker. I am a huge fan of her books, but her latest book (as were the previous two before this one) was slow and dissappointing. I will be glad when she returns to writing what she does best. I do not recommend buying this book."
2,I was disappointed too,"I did manage to finish this book, but I agree with whoever said that it dragged on. It sort of gets boring towards the end. I just love it when they say 'NY Times Best Selling Author' on the book cover. Not this book, I bet. (I did get it from the library)"
2,"comme ci, comme ca.","I got this as a Kindle promo, not knowing anything about the author or her home genre.I have to say I enjoyed the first part of the book. I thought the device of going to Regan's first day of Kindergarten then flash forwarding was interesting and well done.On the other hand, minor nits started piling up for me until they started to take over what I was supposed to be reading. The drug bust left me wondering what happened. The way the resignation of one of the main characters didn't seem to be handled realistically to me and catapulted me out of the story. Then having the cop serve as bodyguard was similarly jolting...I don't think a real PD would have countenanced such a thing and yes, this is fiction...but to suspend disbelief the suspension requires a little plausibility.It's not Agatha Christie, but then it's not a horrible read either. It's good for a monentary pleasant diversion, but I don't think I'll be re-reading it again, unfortunately."
4,Good Read,I really enjoyed this book. It was better than it thought when I received it. This was a free book on the kindle download. So far the free book reads have not been so great. So when I saw a Julie Garwood I was very pleased!
4,Sinclair Lewis takes pokes at small town lives,"She's an outsider, fresh from the big city, newly married to a country doctor in a small Midwestern town, and doing her best to cope with the stultifying life and smugness of her new acquaintances and friends who populate Gopher Prairie, Minn. It's the early 20th Century, and Carol is settling miserably into life here, joining the women's clubs, accompanying her husband on his medical rounds to the farms and country folks. Perhaps she can reform these people, beautify the town, bring some culture to the poor bumpkins. Otherwise, what's the point in trying to live here? This is Sinclair Lewis at his best, providing a scathing look at small town life."
2,ITS NOT THEIR BEST BUT STILL GOOD,its not cockney rejects best its a little bit slower then normal i would say but it still rocks pretty hard id recommend getting other cockney rejects cds before this one but if you got all of them then be my guest get this one
1,Horrible Book,"This was one of the most horrible book that I have had the misfortune of trying to read. I was not able to get past page 22. Within the first few pages, the father called his daughter ""heifer"" too many times (once was too much) and slapped her. This is coming from a father who has had only minimal interaction and none in the last 5 years of the book's setting. The author uses the excuse that the heroine is spoiled as justification for this abuse. If the father did not like the way she had grown up, he should have spent some time with her doing her formative years and imparted his fatherly ""wisdom"".The only thing that could have helped this book is that the father died in the book and the heroine inherited his money. Save your money unless you are into dysfunctional and abusive familial relationships."
5,The Jade Kwan Yin - A Classic Hardy Boys Episode,"Frank and Joe are scuba diving when they are hit by a small crate that's been thrown off a boat. Attempts to return the contents - a statue of the goddess Kwan Yin - to its rightful owner turn out to be more complicated than they expect.This has several classic Hardy Boys elements: wrecked rooms, Frank and Joe getting chewed out by local law enforcement, and the ""after all - you're the oldest"" line that ran through much of the tv series. It also has one of the best portrayals of the relationship between the brothers: a mixture of teasing and absolute loyalty - and the onscreen chemistry between Shaun and Parker - which was one of several reasons the show was so popular."
5,Durable with a great price,This cover is great. It has a good weight and has held up so far. I have a small grill with two burners that is now well covered.
2,Not good with windy area,I got this as a gift for someone last xmas. We put it on the grill and it was in shreds within a month. I'll admit we live in a windy area. Found holes busting through the fabric within the first week. Disappointed as I was excited about the velcro.
3,Strat,"Overall this is a good book. However, I must say that I have never read a bad book about stratigraphy. Boggs does a good job with this one. I fail to understand where a student could be confussed by his writting style. I suggest that those of you who were confused should read Tucker before you attempt to read the more advanced books."
1,Rebound. Legend of Earl Manigote.,"PURCHASED THIS DVD ON SPECK, BECAUSE MY 9 yr old GRANDSON LOVES BASKETBALL. THIS IS A NASY DVD, CONTAINING DRUG USE, BAD LANGUAGE AND EXTREMELY BAD BEHAVIOUR. I WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED BUT AS I DID NOT KNOW THIS MANS STORY I DID NOT KNOW THAT THE DVD MIGHT CONTAIN SUCH MATERIAL. THANK GOODNESS THAT I REVIEWED IT WHEN I FIRST RECEIVED IT SO THAT I WAS AWARE HOW UNSUITABLE IT WAS FOR THIS AGEGROUP. A VERY SAD STORY REALLY, 'GOAT' HAD SUCH A TALENT FOR THE GAME BUT FOR LITTLE ELSE IT SEEMED. SUCH A WASTE. I WILL CONTINUE TO BE DILIGENT IN PREVIEWING MATERIAL I PURCHASE FOR MY GRANDCHILDREN, SO EVERYONE BE WARNED TO ALSO CHECK UNKNOWN STUFF OUT.OTHERWISE, STORY WAS INDEPTH, AND FOR ANYONE WANTING BASKETBALL HISTORY, YES IT WOULD BE A GOOD REFERENCE."
1,very poor quality = you get what you pay for ..... junk,"poor fit and finish, poor quality all around. chuck had difficulty holding too bits, they kept coming out. motor vibrated and sounded iffy. immediately returned it. my rotozip tool with a flex shaft was soooo much better than the grizzly tool."
2,Not as fun as you'd think...,"While this game is fun for a while, it gets old very fast. This game is awful when compared to GTA 3. Do yourself a favor and use the $ you were going to use here and save up to buy a PS2 and buy GTA 3."
4,Grand Theft Auto - Game? Or way of life?,"This game is a game you can't rate by it's graphics or sound tracks. It is only to be rated by the fun value and playablity. Even though the game is in a cartoonish overview the entire game, and the sound track is funny, but swiftly becomes tired and repetetive, this is one of those games that can keep you on the edge of your seat for hours. It's fun to drive the cars around town, then to use flamethrowers, and even snatch an American army tank and take out un-suspecting suvillians. Rating from 1-10 is a definite 9."
1,GTA2,"The controls of this game are confusing. The sounds is weak. and The speed is to fast for the weak top down view that is given. I plan on playing this game for a while longer, but I will sell it very soon. This game is not WORTH ful price."
2,waa waa waa,"it's all the same. their first album was better. the best songs are halo, she's up she's down, and champion. this band rocks in concert though. buy it anyway, good music for the car."
1,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this album, but, alas, Oleander has not produced a worthy follow-up to their smash album ""February Son."" While they have updated their sound a bit, making it more ""pop,"" they haven't broken through with anything that good. It's an average album at best, but fans should expect more from these talented guys. Maybe the third time will be a charm. Until then, save your cash."
1,their worst CD yet,"I have been a tilt fan since they started, but this CD is horrible![.] If you are going to buy tilt, please buy one of their earlier CD's. Half of the songs on this are revised from previous CD's, but they sound worse! It's like the band went to the recording studio wasted. UGH![.]I regret ever buying this, out of the whole CD, one or two songs are OK."
1,Are there no Outlines? Are there no editors?,"Maddeningly disjointed and disorienting. I turned to this book as to a celebrated tutor, wanting Glenny to make straight the crooked paths of Yugoslavian history. Instead, I jogged along mountain roads to which only Glenny had the map, hearing ""snatches of dispatches."" Clearly, Glenny possesses a wealth of knowledge about his subject -- but so does the graduate assistant in physics who offers to ""clear up a few things,"" then fills the chalkboard with gibberish, leaving you more confused than when the class began. Shame on the editors of this book for failing to package it in a readable form. What could have genuinely been the answer to thousands of readers' concern about this subject remains a hopeless muddle, a stream-of-consciousness hodgepodge. (For instant relief, turn to Christiane Amanpour's masterful video documentary, Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation.)"
5,Magical!,"My husband introduced me to this album in 1995. I absolutely LOVE it. We still own it on Cassette, and it is almost worn out from being played so often; thus, the reason I am buying it for him on CD as a stocking stuffer! It is the most magically soothing and calming recording that I have ever heard. He bought it thinking it was just tribal sounds, but it is actually spoken word, telling of the Native American explanations for many folklore and legends that we still encounter today; for example the Creation of the Universe and Man and why Coyotes howl at night. We listen to it almost every night as we go to bed, and it works wonders after a long stressful day! On a side note, I have been unable to find any albums that are similar to this one. If anybody knows of any, please contact me to let me know! Enjoy this album!"
3,great but bulky!,"I bought it to go on a hike, I had to carry it, so though it's a very comfortable one, it's still very bulky, and not easy to wash."
4,Worth the Time,This is the first book I have read by North Patterson. I usually read Grisham if I am looking for a lawyer/courtroom drama but felt lately like his books have been not keeping my interest. I thoroughly enjoyed The Final Judgment and will now buzz through his other books for a critical look. North Patterson managed to go back and forth in time with Caroline Masters in such a way that kept the interest of the reader for the past and present which is sometimes hard to achieve.
3,"Slow start, weak ending","The Final Judgement was a decent book, but like other readers have found, I'm sure, the killer is no real mystery and the story takes some time to get into. The flashbacks into the past around the middle of the book give the book its only real depth. There is a surprise at the end, but it comes off dead. Don't make the mistake of expecting a courtroom thriller; this story is more about the Master's family and their past. A non-distracting vacation book or something to read when you have the flu."
5,SCARY AS HELL!!!!!,"Loved it, so so scary, the plot, the acting, the camera running with the characters, it all comes together here. I would def watch the the first rec (not quarantine) before watching this. This is with out a doubt the best of the three. I love this movie!"
2,Part 2 Dud,"I did not like this movie. After watching the original ""Rec"", I thought that this part 2 was going to be a good follow up. Unfortunately, it wasnt what I expected. It started out well but the ending was far below expectations!"
3,Some movies are not so good.,"I really need to read the discription more before buying a movie. This is the original from where Quarintine came from. But the actors are not the best, the English dub was done only on the first movie and not the second movie of which I threw my money away on and only wound up destroying the second DVD. So not all movies are really worth buying."
4,Completing my library,"Bought these just because I don't have them any more.Have been reviewing various authors on my web log: www.fantasyandcrimebooks,com"
2,Bland.,Are this songs for kids at all? I am myself bored listening to this CD. I wish it was what it promises by the cover.
2,Not the best album...,"Well to begin with the sound on this album isnt too great at all. The music isnt at all as good as on ""Drep De Kristne"". All i can say about this album is; If you are a collector or like Troll then get it, if youve never heard Troll then get ""Drep De Kristne"" first."
5,Lots of fun,I purchased this toy for my 4 year old niece who enjoys hide and seek. She loves the little monkey and the magic wand. She can't help herself and practically shows you where she hid the monkey. She also enjoys finding the monkey using the wand with lights and beeping sounds. Great idea and easy to find places to hide the animal. Highly recommend.
2,"Great Concept, Poor Execution","I read so many good reviews that I thought maybe those who rated this product poorly had purchased duds or earlier models.Nope, the product really is pretty worthless. You do have to be within a foot of the hidden monkey already for the wands to respond, and of course putting the monkey behind anything- even a sheet- interferes and mostly blocks the sound waves being imitted."
2,Hide & Seek Safari,Toy has been out of the box for 1 hour.....Leg broke offTail has unscrewed from the monkeyGood idea poor execution!
4,Age...what age?,So much drama in one book. I was guessing one way but the book ran another way. My favorite kind of story keeps me guessing. Loved it.
4,Quite the debut,"The headstones are a good, but not great band. If it wasn't for the lead singer, Hugh Dillon, I don't think I'd own any own their CD's. As it is, I have all three. This is their best. While most have heard ""Something Stands for Nothing"", a solid song in its own right, the landmark cut from the album has to be their cover of the Travelling Wilbury's ""Tweeter and the Monkey Man"". If you are interested in this band, start with this album over the others."
3,"OLD MATERIAL, BUT STILL A GREAT VOICE!","I love Leann and her voice is exceptional.....probably one of the best female vocalist out there today among Martina Mcbride, Trisha Yearwood and my personal favorite Alison Krauss. However Leann needs to progress in her music and stop from reaching back. A cover of an old standard from time to time would be tasteful, but to release the same old rehashed material is beginning to bore me and many of her fans. Leann please take CONTROL of your career and look to Janet Jackson as an example! We still love you!"
1,Would have gave it 0 if I could,"Leann Rimes is a hack! I've farted better music! And plus there are way to many I love America songs out there today. We get the idea!! I enjoy living in this country as much as anyone else but come on, an entire album of crap is how you repay this country! I say we deport her."
3,Catholic Saint,This Catholic nun had a great memory of events that happened in her life. Great historic reading and quite refreshing to read.
5,A good and overlooked shooter,"Shogo was a shooter released around the time of Half-life. Itfeatured some original twists. For example, there is a cool animethemed story full of twists and turns. It let you run around in a huge robot (mecha) and on foot. There are completely different weapon sets for both level sets.... The levels are well integrated into the plot and well designed. The graphics are very nice and are built on the Lithtech engine by Monolith who also made Shogo. Watch for this engine its giving Quake 3 and Unreal a run for their money. Oh and did I mention that the main character kicks ...? After hearing some of his one-liners I almost fell off my chair. The bottem line here is that Shogo is a great game for its extremely low price. If you are one of the many that missed it rectify your mistake forthwith."
2,No Rod Soul,"The rock hits on this DVD are not sung with the usual Rod gusto, instead he is still recovering from the throat surgery from a couple years previous. And the audience is a hand picked bunch of stiffs who add nothing. Rod sings the standards with respect but they don't sound much different from the CD. All in all, not a good performance, and definitely NOT like a real Rod concert. Skip this and go for the Storytellers AND the ""Royal Albert Hall"" DVDs--both are superior."
3,Great Price for a DECENT Coffee Maker,"First off, I am not a coffee connoisseur BUT I do enjoy a decently strong and full flavored cup of coffee in the morning. After owning this for about 2 weeks, I have to say that I'm not entirely impressed. Immediately after brewing (less than 15 minutes) the coffee tastes great and lives up to my standards. If I leave the coffee on for longer than this, say 1.5 hrs, the quality drastically worsens, to the point where I will brew more coffee instead of drinking the 'warmed' coffee.I'm not positive why this happens but it does drop my rating of it drastically. If the coffee stayed fresh for a longer time, it would get 5 stars, since it does taste good immediately after brewing. With that in mind, it is relatively inexpensive so I would advise someone who doesn't care as much about the warmed coffee to buy this model since it will perform up to most peoples' standards."
4,Excellent coffee,Excellent coffee-nice and hot. Easy to use with no oddball features. I studied coffeemakers a long time before buying this one and thus far have no regrets.
1,"much too delicate, a fragile carafe, it cracked within 3 months",The carafe cracked and shattered within 3 months of use not worth expense of mailing it back. Design flaw with basket it sits inside an interior holder which is built in it can not be removed to be cleaned. Overall clunky shape; I was looking for a reasonable price maker that shuts off automatically -- am still looking.
3,coffe just O.K.,"I purchased this coffee machine last week at Target (cheapest there) after staying up forever trying to decide which coffee maker to get. There are lots of things I like about this one-- looks nice, auto shut off, coffee pot opening large so it's easy to clean, coffee is hot enough, and coffee pot did not drip when pouring. For all of these reasons, I was very excited, BUT... the coffee was weak!! The most important thing about a coffee maker should be the taste of the coffee, and in my experience, this coffee maker makes very weak coffee. Of course, I tried adding more grinds (MUCH more), but each time the coffee came out the same. So, despite it's good points, I've decided that I can't live with that. I'm returning it and searching for a different one."
2,"A cup of hot coffee and hold the grounds, please.","I must be doing something wrong judging by all the great reviews left for this coffeemaker. I thought buying a Hamilton Beach would insure a hassle free product. After all, what can they do to screw up a coffemaker?? I have been using this maker for about 9 months now and have two big issues from day one. Right after brewing, the coffee is not hot. So, I end up nuking the first few cups. Also, when making 10 or more cups and therefore using more coffee grounds, I always end up with grounds IN the pot. I attribute both of these problems to the hot water sitting in the grounds basket too long which overflows the coffee filter. Bottom line: warm coffee with a side order of grounds. I am hoping that the extremely hard water we have here kills this off sooner than later."
4,Good coffeemaker,My recent purchase of the Hamilton Beach Coffeemaker was due to my other one not getting the coffee brewed hot enough. I'm very pleased with this newer model.
4,No spilled water!,"This is the first coffee maker I've owned that doesn't spill water all over the counter when you're trying to pour from the carafe to the reservoir. Brilliant! Other reviewers say the access hole is small, and it may be, but I've seen bigger accesses and the carafe still spilled water everywhere. This design works! (The access is sloped like a funnel, making it even easier.) It also pours cleanly from the pot to the cup. And get this: it has not made a mess with the coffee grounds even once! As advertised, coffee comes out hot and stays hot on the plate. Super easy to set the clock and the timer, unlike my previous unit. Recommended."
4,Best coffee pot I ever bought,"Hamilton Beach 43254 Classic Stainless 12-Cup CoffeemakerI bought this coffee pot and I am very satisfied with it so far. Makes great coffee; it has a large enough opening for you to pour the water; easy to program timer; love the black color and stainless steel; looks way more expensive than it was. I read the reviews (as I usually do) on Amazon from people who purchased this coffee maker, and decided to go for it. This coffee maker replaced my under the cabinet Black & Decker coffee maker. I would buy another Hamilton Beach in the future."
1,Returned to vendor,Vendor sent Item 43254R. Returned item 2 weeks ago. Still waiting for credit to show on my account. Not at all pleased with the service.
5,Nice quality,This product helps stabilize the Shop Fox D2660 34-inch Deep Workbench Leg. It is easy to attach. It looks great. It ships very quickly.
5,More than marvelous!,"When I read the title and saw the music was written between 1474 and 1516 I must confess I thought it was going to be ""boring"". What was my surprise when I heard it!... The music is magnificent and the voices so beautifull, it has very joyfull pieces that will make your heart and soul rejoice, that it will be impossible not to replay it over and over"
5,Classic Barry White,Hard to believe He has been Gone for almost a year now.but the Brother's Music is timless.the slow Jams with the strong pulse of Rhythm&Smooth layered Strings that just draw you in.His voice just booms with Force&never lets up.this is a classic Set that showcases the Greatness that is Barry White.
5,A Mamoulian Western!! Leo Carillo and opera too!!,Lots of fun and fine singing. Great to hear those Mexican songs done so well by opera singer Nino Martini who made several movies. Nino gets kidnapped by Carillo into his gang of bandidos because he loves Nino's singing which broke up a riot at a movie theatre....plenty of funny character actors and even a ladies trio in the radio station studio which Carillo hijacks to display his new singer on the air. Lots of fun as crooks from both sides of the border match wits.
1,No song titles???,This is gotta be some of the most piss poor advertising for music I have ever seen. Once I see the song titles up or if someone is willing to post it I will gladly remove my rating but till then this will remain the same. Why would anyone want to buy something if their is no product reviews???
1,Old news,"There is nothing new here, and what is here is a mess when it comes to how the book is organized. The author (and I admit I don't know who she is) doesn't seem to know what she's talking about because her style categories are ill defined, so the book comes off as an anything-but-helpful mishmash of pretty rooms. If you want real decorating help, keep looking."
5,Chilling!!!!,"Groundbreaking in every sense of the word!! Before shark week, before Jaws and before we knew much of anything about sharks this crew took to the sea in search of the notorious Great White shark!! Superb entertainment for all ages!!"
4,The re-issue finaly relased,"It has been a long time coming but they have finally released 'Blue Water, White Death' again after years of it being a deleted title. Not only that but it also gets a DVD release.It is great to see this amazing Documentary when searching for the Great Whites was in its early stages. The team behind this did an excellent job with limited Technology of this time. Join the famous Taylors as well as Rodney Fox to see the Great White Shark. Picture quality is superb and some extras are included with an event to celebrate this achievement."
4,sharks,"Having waited a long time for this DVD to come out, I was knocked out by the quality of the transfer, fantastic, all the scenes came flooding back from the first time that I had seen it, it is very informative for its time, as only one person at the time had filmed great whites, Rodney Fox, the voyage to find them, from south Africa to South Australia, the Taylors really show there understanding for these creatures, even getting out of the cage to swim with them, the extras are great, showing the young Taylors and Fox, then more recent footage, how they have aged over the years, see the movie that inspired Jaws, get an understanding of these sea creatures, no change in 300 million years, still perfect."
4,The Caveman's Valentine,Bought this soundtrack because I really enjoyed the movie. The movie is super. The soundtrack is good.
5,Don't Miss This One!,"After my 3 months spent with Baldur's Gate I was desperate for another game that would consume me in the same way. I searched desperately and bought many that I loaded on my computer, played for a few minutes then un-installed... disappointed. Not so with Icewind Dale! The only complaint I have is that it is very time consuming to go back to areas you already left (there are only certain places you can move to different areas). Other than that... I have never been so mad, intrigued, happy, pi**ed off, TERRIFIED, or challenged the way I was with ID. It took me about 3 weeks of CONSTANT game playing to finish the game (although the ending is kind of cheesy) and I was left (once again) wanting more. Although it will probably be a long time before I go through the whole game again, it will be one I keep for years. If you want a game that challenges your mind AND keeps you entertained, Icewind Dale will fix you right up."
5,Easy Click Easy Go,"Icewind Dale is not like Baldurs Gate, this difference are that Baldurs Gate has more freedom in it, both stories are a straight line story, and pretty easy to understand. Although you really have to know a bit about roleplaying, and not the 3rd edition but the old AD&D; 2nd edition. If u were a fan of the old Roleplaying way you should diffinetly get this game, actually you should get this game if you are a Roleplaying fan.The Game set in the world of Icewind Dale also better known as the home of Drizzt Do' Urden the famous Drow. written by R.A Salvatore. Although Drizzt is not in the story the game is amazing great Grafic and nice sound.If you are a person of patience and person which love to explore this is something for you."
5,Works Perfectly !!!,Spark plug blew out of my wife's 2000 VW Jetta 2.0L engine (aeg engine). Purchased this kit which took about 30 minutes to tap hole and install metal sleeve. Waited overnight for the loctite sealant to cure on the metal sleeve and car is now back on the road!!If you have a similar problem then buy this product and your nightmare will be over.Worth every penny and more. You won't be disappointed.
4,Good Dental Help for Pets - All Natural,"I bought Pet Kiss for my aging cat (she's nearly 19), who has kidney disease and can't get her teeth cleaned by the vet any more. I wanted something that was completely natural - no chemicals, preservatives, dyes, flavorings, alcohol, etc. to stress her kidneys. Pet Kiss fits the bill! She's very picky, but didn't even notice when I added it to her water. The one problem I had was that, if the water in the dish sits for a couple of days, it will grow mold or bacteria (no preservatives). So I would make up a quart of water (or a gallon) in advance and store it in the fridge. Then I'd completely change her water and wash out the dish every couple of days. This solved the problem, but there are no directions to refrigerate the treated water after it's made up, or to change the water completely every day or so. My cat's teeth and gums seem to be healthy, and her breath has improved."
3,Tartar control product,East to use and as I had a smaller bottle I just refill it for use from the Gallon container. The dogs seem to prefer the water without it - maybe there is a taste tat they don't like - however I am not about to try it myself.
2,The Shins meet Abba,"First time to listen to this band and they just didn't impress. I find the drummer to be quite good but otherwise this came across as way too ""poppie"" for me and an amalgam of the worst of the Shins (whom I admire) and Abba (whom I don't). This'll be collecting dust on the shelf."
4,"Decent, but nothing fancy","This is a fine colander, but it's not really anything special. I do like that it has many small holes, rather than fewer larger holes that some colanders of this size have. So it drains fairly efficiently. It's a good size for most uses, from greens to pasta, etc. The handles are very nice, especially if you want to strain into another pot, so the colander will rest easily on it (as smaller, one handle strainers are inclined to fall into the pot).A couple caveats, though. Firstly, this is very thin stainless steel with punched holes. It feels cheap, but I've not had any problems yet with dents or any other damage. The outside is a bit rough feeling, but the inside is smooth. It's not the nicest colander out there, but for the money it's worth it and good to have on hand."
3,"Works well, but...","I bought it because of a segment on America's Test Kitchen where they say that this type of colander is their favorite: finely perforated metal, rather than plastic or mesh.The strainer works really well. It is great for rice, Israeli couscous and angel hair and aborio pasta.There are a couple issues I have:1) The inside is smooth and easy to clean. The outside feels like a microplane and it's just shredding my sponges.2) The base right should also have slots of holes, because otherwise the bottom fills in with water...or...if you put the colander over the drain, the ring blocks the water outside the ring from going down the drain and then the sink fills up. Probably not a big deal for people with nice new stainless steel sinks, but I've got an old stained ceramic sink. It's also the sink we use for rinsing the floor mop and paint brushes...I don't like food coming in contact with the sink, and that includes strained food soaking in sitting water in the sink."
2,Not Impressed,"When the colander was pulled from the box, my husband said, ""Is it used?"" The colander is quite small for a 'large' I was expecting it to be bigger. Made in China. I should have purchased the cuter, larger colander from Pier One for the same price."
3,Less robust than then I was hoping for.,"It has a nice tall footing to keep it off the botom of the sink better than my old plastic one, but the bowl is so thin it is closer to being mesh than a bowl. I doubt it will stand up to the years of use I'd normally expect from a kitchen implement."
4,"Good idea, imperfect design/construction","For some reason, I was expecting it to be ""finished"" better, but I still love it.What I mean is, the inside is super smooth, but the outside of the bowl feels like it's shredding my sponges when I wash it.I do wish the base had openings for the water to flow out, but my sink has a wire rack in the bottom almost all of the time, so it's not a huge deal for me...but I can see how it would be annoying.Most useful colander I've ever owned, but execution isn't 100%."
2,leaks after 1 year,It worked great for a year. It then began to leak through the back where pump electrical cord enters . Also leaked where storage container meets the bowl. Then check valve leaked. It then began to overfill and later under fill the bowl. Replacement parts were very expensive. The customer support is in India and they are less than responsive to e-mail and not knowledgeable. this is a good product only if you want to replace it every 1 1/2 years or so.
5,Mind hacks,"This is a really great book. More novelty than improvement, but still great. If you're looking for something that will be useful as well as attention grabbing then look for the second edition; ""Mind Performance Hacks"""
5,Neuroscience in a nutshell,"This book isn't about ""hacking your brain"" at all. What it really is is an overview of neuroscience, presented as 100 different topics which talk about how the brain works. Ever wonder how our brain figures out which direction sound comes from? Or how we pick out patterns in chaos? Or how we construct our vision of the world? Not only does it explain it in a very accessible fashion, but it gives hyperlinks to things online which have mp3s or jpegs which help demonstrate the point so that you can verify for yourself that it's how it works."
2,Label on product does not match the advertised label,"Boric acid is boric acid, for someone who has used it in the past. For someone like my partner who is hesitant to use any new products, it was important that the product was advertised as specifically ""for vaginal yeast infections"". But the label on the actual product shipped does not match what was advertised. Instead the fact that it is a poisonous substance was most prominently displayed and nowhere on the container does it say ""for vaginal yeast infections"". As a result, the product sits unused, and I am disappointed I did not get what was shown at least as far as the label is concerned."
4,New silk shell,"I received this item very quickly. I wanted it to match an overblouse that I had and it is amazing that the color of the picture so acurately captures the color of the shell. I haven't worn it yet, but it appears to be very well made."
1,Orange Silk shell,"Did not like it, Too high on my neck. Material shows every wet spot there is, too tight. Would not order again."
5,great game,"i probably own 2 or 3 computer games and couldn't care less about space wars or star trek or other stuff like that, but this is a really good game even if you're not into that stuff. Its simply fun to play"
5,The best book about growth,This journey is a exeptional story of courage and sincerity with oneself. It is rare to see this nowadays. The book is an excelent guide for any Adult Educator interested in Transformative Adult Education. Vikrant showed me what it is to be sincerely intrested in your own development.
3,"good for motorskills,but too tight","Nice illustration, good for training of motor skills, but the snap and button are a bit too tight for kids."
3,More scent than flavor,"This is not a bad coffee - it's smooth, has no aftertaste, not bitter, etc. However, it really doesn't taste too much like chocolate or raspberry to me. It can smell the chocolate and raspberry when I open the package and fill up the coffeepot, but it kind of ends there. Once it's in my mug, I really don't taste anything other than coffee. To me it has an ever-so-slight smoky (but not burnt!) flavor. It's not unpleasant...it's just not chocolate or raspberry."
2,"Darn, feeling let down.","I was eagerly awaiting Mia's story. I was completely caught up in this trilogy because the first two books were fantastic. But Face the Fire was over about 30 pages in, it was predictable and flat and I only kept turning the pages because I kept hoping it would get better. It didn't.It was rushed and the story just wasn't there. No amount of flashy magick can make up for a dull story. Maybe the next trilogy will be better. But I guess when you write trilogies it's the first two books that count anyway right? Why put forth the effort in the 3rd when you know everyone's going to buy it anyway..., that is, until it happens on the next trilogy."
2,"fizzle and drissle, mope and moan, this book will make you titch and groan","I too was hoping for a good story about Mia and Sam. It was puzzling to me how uninteresting and shallow the characters were, the pointless sub-currents and the negative energy after Mia with really no story, source or purpose."
5,Face the Fire,"I enjoyed it very much, it was the last book of:Nora Roberts (Three Sisters Island Trilogy)"
2,Witchcraft...not here,"This was no where near as good as the first two books. I was extremely disappointed with this last of the triology. There was no suspense with this one, lacked the mystery that the other two had. Too much sordid sex and not enough of the magic from Three Sisters Island. Very disappointing......."
5,Simply Spellbinding,"Nora Roberts is a witch of words. Her magickal fiction selections are simply the best. If you like a little magic, or paranormal mixed in with a lot of love and laughter, the three sister's trillogy is the set for you. All three books are a must read but there was something compelling about Mia that I couldn't wait for her story to be told. I was not disapointed. Sugcessful business woman, wiccan by birth, and by choice Mia can not find a man to replace the young man who moved away and broke her heart. It is years latter now and Sam is back, can Mia trust again ? Can they work together to save their home ? Can they find what they had before ? You will laugh and you will be delighted, you will curse and you will cry. This series is a well done as the ""Donavon Legacy"". Way to GO MRS Roberts !!"
2,[Bad] ending to a Promising Beginning,"First 2 books = fabulous.Face The Fire:* Too much stuff thrown into one book.* Sam Logan goes from being hardcore businessman to mega-Pagan Witch man. Too much bi-polarity there for me to get into him. Not as likable as other heroes because of this.* Pacing seemed off (probably because Nora was desperately trying to tie up loose ends).* Mia and Sam get back together WAY too quickly for someone nursing a heartache as long as she has.* Ending is not the tumultuous explosion I had wanted, expected, perhaps even needed.This book didn't deliver . . . great build up in the previous 2 books, but Mia's story (which was the one I had wanted to read the most) I found seriously disappointing. The plot was only so-so, and the writing seemed a bit choppy and jarring at times.Very sad for me!happy reading!"
3,Face the Fire is a big disappointment.,"Once again, Nora Roberts has let her readers down. The 3rd book in this trilogy seems to be an afterthought, as if she was in a hurry to wrap it up. Perhaps she is writing too much, and not taking the time to be creative. I looked forward to the story of Mia for months;what I read was a partial explanation of what happened between them. Sam is a very weak character. The story is weak, boring, and confusing, and I had the 'blahs' when I finished. Perhaps Nora should give up writing trilogies.This has happened before - Born in Shame was weak, but the first two in the trilogy were wonderful and funny. I would like to revisit the three sisters in Ireland.I hate to say it, but I used to buy everthing by Nora Roberts, but not anymore. I will be more cautious from now on."
2,skip this book,"I loved the first two books of the trilogy, in fact, I read them cover to cover in a weekend. The final volume really is lacking in development and flow. There is not much drama, not much suspence, and the characters fall flad. Roberts would have done well to take more time developing the plot and introducing the characters. This was a real disappointment.Do read the first two volumes - they are sexy and saavy and great to read"
2,Not Up To Par,"I was very disappointed with this 3-book series, particularly the last one. These were not the usual gripping, can't-put-it-down Nora Roberts books that we all love. I saved these books to read until all 3 were available, and read them right after reading Nora Roberts' new book ""Three Fates"" which was fantastic. Maybe that's another reason these were a real letdown. The story was too far-fetched to be believable and the 3rd book seemed to hurry through tying all 3 stories together."
5,This Song is HOT !,"The most important producer/remixer give tu us a beautiful music, with groove and style ! This song will be everything to dance e dream ...David Morales is the Best !"
2,Not enough animals.,"This video suffers from a lack of actual animal babies. The makers opted to use a lot of computer animation of a lizard character supposedly guiding the viewer through the world of animal babies, but the lizard and his bad childcare habits (he has a baby lizard of his own)is downright disturbing. I would only reccommend this video for older children who can deal with the content (baby spiders consuming their mother, a bird that lays its eggs in other birds nests, then upon hatching, destroys the other birds' eggs, and deserts the foster parents)."
5,Excellent Purchase,Esencia by Loewe's is one of the best Colognes on the market. My sweetheart loves it. What can I say...
1,Don't confuse this with the 1950's B/w classic,"It's diabolical allright, but not in the way its makers intended.The classic film called 'Night of the Demon' in europe was released as 'Curse of the Demon' in the US. It is also available on DVD and highly recomended."
3,"Cliche photos, some interesting details","The book contains some details about mcQueen's life that only the writer knew , that give a hint about how mcQueen viewed life, danger, and speed.but the photos are mainly advertising ones and not real life.i would expect more on the life of mcqueen as a person and not only as an actor"
4,A lot of room but it fills up quickly...,"This bag is a solid bag for someone who is on the go with their camera equipment and wants a bit of extra protection. I wouldn't recommend it for someone who is looking for a bag to carry a number of professional lenses and a few camera bodies- it is a bit too deep to have convienent access to all your equipment. While the bag comes with a number of dividers, I find that it just isn't the right bag if you are going to carry a lens like a fixed 35mm or 50mm. As many other reviews have said, the top isn't exactly user friendly if you have a full length lens attached but if you just need to grab something small it can come in handy."
3,Review 1 Yr Later,"The cover is sized nice for a larger grill. We have Blue Ember iQue and it is inexpensive, but 1 yr later there are rips. You get what you pay for, not we're in the market for a replacement. We'll buy another if I can find suitable. If not, I'll go for this one with expectations of replacing annually."
4,Nice grill cover to keep the grill out of the garage and leave room for shelves,"Well made it seems, I have only had it for 3-4 months, but it is great for the price. In East Texas, the weather allows year long grilling and I do not like to store the grill in the garage and take up my shelving space and mess up my garage organization. This lets me keep the grill out on the porch. [...]"
4,"Good fit for my Fiesta ""Blue Ember"" grill (FG50069)","It's pretty difficult to find an ""affordable"" cover for larger grills like my Fiesta ""Blue Ember"" (FG50069), so I decided to give this a shot. Not much to lose considering it was lower than $20.It fits the grill pretty nicely, and I appreciate how pliable the cover is. It's lined with some felt material, and the green is darker (and nicer) than shown on the picture.We'll see how it holds up, but again, at such a low price, I can conceivably replace it in a year or two without worries."
4,A great inexpensive car camping tent,"We used this tent during the Labor Day weekend camping. I have to mention that we did not face any inclement during our camping so not sure how it would hold up in rain or wind (hence the 4 start rating).It was very easy to setup the tent (15 minutes max for one person, much faster with another pair of hands) and was spacious enough for two adults and a 2 yr old kid with some room to spare. The tent is designed adequately for air circulation, especially without the rain fly. The temperatures during the day were in mid 90s still inside the tent it was not too bad.Couple of negatives though: 1) the poles does not feel very sturdy, 2) difficult to zip/unzip down the door (the problem could be the way I set the tent up).The bottom of the tent is very sturdy built of tarp like material, but for extra protection we used a tarp below and it worked fine.Overall for the price I paid for the tent it was a good purchase."
5,Must have tent,"I used this tent on my last backpacking trip. I new that it was going to rain while I was there but nothing like what I had experienced. I hiked 8 miles to get to my camping spot and I then set up my tent. It took about 20 minutes and I had never set up the tent before. The tent withstood 12 hours of HEAVY downpours and wind gusts up to 50mph. That is without the tent stakes even being put in. Since my camping spot was slightly smaller than 9-7 feet. Just to give you an idea of the severity of the storm, when I got home I had found out that a tornado had hit and destroyed homes just 20 Miles away. The downside to this tent is that in a strong storm the humidity will get so bad inside your tent that it will actually start to drip water even though there is no leak in the tent. This tent is an unbelievable buy considering its price."
4,Mesh square,"The mesh square is a gear loft, it gives you a place to put a flashlight, your glasses (if you wear such), your wallet, etc. Its a nice feature if floor space is tight."
3,"When it rains, it pours.","We bought this for our first camping trip to Sequoia.The tent was easy to setup. Took 30 mins the first time and 15 afterwards. It was cold and rainy the entire two days we were there. Two major problems. Even with the raincover on , you can still expect a lots of outside cold/hot air to get in. So good sleeping bags are a must. secondly, water seeps into the tent from the bottom. We had a tarp under, but still some water crept in.Since the tent is one of the most important thing that you can buy for a camping trip. I would suggest that you spend more and get as good a tent as you can. Also, this is supposed to be a 4 person tent, but you always wanna get bigger than you want. To sleep this is okay for maybe 3 people. Get a taller bigger tent and you wont regret it."
5,incredible vocals,"i speak italian, i understand every single word of what she's singing, and believe, Laura Pausini can't hold a candle to Giorgia's talent, both for lyrics and voice. Giorgia's sound is a mix of Whitney and Mariah, and the songs are a mix of powerful ballads, r&b-soul tunes and also a little of country feeling! Really worth the purcase! ;)"
3,Not bad,"I have to say, for italian pop music, I Love Laura Pausini as a vocalist, and her music and lyrics are beautiful. I have to say, both are good but Laura is in a league of her own, not because Giorgia is bad but because Laura has the ability to get her music and her choice of music and writers that are really good at what they do... and the songs go across the world, to 3 continents and hey, she must be doing something right!If you want great music, italian pop music or even in spanish, get Laura's Cds...."
1,?,"WHAT THE HELL IS THE BONUS TRACK? YESH, IF YOU EXPECT US TO BE INTERESTED, AT LEAST LIST THE TRACKS STUPID AMAZON.COM"
5,Faithfully!,"I remember this album when I was in the 9th grade. I love this album. It is soulful and has more vibe. The album is influenced from all genres of jazz,R&B,and hip-hop are evident. This album was her most introspective personal album dealing with life's experiences musically tailored to fit all the emotions and situations she incur. Devotion,love,and hope are key ingredients that make the present great and the future much brighter. This album has been certified Gold. Remember,this was 2001-2002."
2,ZOOM zom NO zoom,"It is a nice player but forget the zoom and the menu's are a pain (You are in deep do-do if you misplace the manual). I repeat for emphasis, there is no zoom control and you are not going to be able to expand a wide screen movie to fill your standard television screen.Go to the Sony website and -www.sony.com- the support area and get the manual and take a look. You will not be able to resize the picture to fit the TV. Sony may say you can in their advertisement, but it did not work for me. I am not technically challenged either. I built my own computer from parts and I installed the replacement electrostatic panels on my Martin Logan's.The picture outputted was very good, and the remote was not so good."
3,Sluggish Remote???,"Cannot fault this unit for picture quality or for that matter, quality of build, etc. Only faults I found are with the remote, and they are fairly minor, to wit, must be pointed directly at the unit (not as forgiving as most TV or VCR remotes), and access of desired functions seems ""sluggish"" (you press, then wait a short time, THEN it is accessed!). Very good quality, otherwise, for the price...."
2,Not Enough,"Wouldn't it be great if it contained all the versions, just like the original 12 inch. The extended remix, Single Version and the dub along with Time waits for no one. That would be a real 12"" classic on cd. Will they ever get it right?"
3,Average stuff,"Rather average release from Thrill Jockey here. Cut up band rehearsals with computer generated noise layers. Nothing very ground breaking and more importantly, nothing really absorbing in the listening experience. There is potential however, if the group mature in the developement of their music."
5,reverberate your vertebrae,"I can't stop listening to this album, in this cape, with the crotch cut out, and my grandmother yelling at to me take out the garbage and clean her bum.If you like Millie Vanillie and Leatherface, you're gonna love this album, and I don't know why. The beats are dark and dirty, and doom's lyrics are off the hook like that aborted fetus I just took down from that special mobile I had hanging from my garage ceiling.It feels like the American Psycho of hip-hop except this dude's is ripping lyrics like your bigger brother ripping farts into your mouth down your neck--gaseous! Pick up this lp and adopt an uffed walk to accompany it."
2,dissapointing !,"doom comes out fresh with lyrical skills but the production suck's i'm just being honest. but it's not doom's fault it's the people that produced it, anyways i reccomend thet u listen yo it first before buying it"
5,Best CD I own!,"I got the Tenacious D cd for Christmas, and I listen to it every day! It's by far my favorite CD, and I've seen the band 3 times. Buy this, and prepare to have your socks rocked off!"
2,Mediocre,"I ordered this album because it came highly recommended (and because I have enjoyed Jack Black in a number of movies) but I am unimpressed.Maybe it needs to grow on me, but I doubt it.It is amusing at times but overall I found it repetitive.In addition, although the profanity was not terribly offensive, it does become tiresome."
5,Jack Black has a Band?,"Wow. I didn't know that, but I like this album a lot. It is very funny, yet a little perverted. But that can be excused! I love this album!"
2,Let's be honest...,"Tenacious D is indeed the greatest band in the world but this album is not a good example of their work. What this is a good example of is the record industry taking an artist and watering them down so that their true essence is mild enough not to disturb or offend anyone. They have become homogonized and sprinkled with mass appeal. The unadulterated RAWK of Tenacious D lay primarily in their simplicity and passion; this album has been overproduced, as was my fear when I heard of this undertaking. I only hope the D doesn't bring the Dust Brothers and their unneccesary sound effects on tour with them. Long live the D."
4,The D Rocks!,"This album is a long time coming. The D has been around for years and I can't believe it took this long for a formal album to come out. The tracks are both hilarious and musically sound. If these guys wanted to, they could be legit rock-stars (if they aren't already). Jack Black has amazing vocals, and Kyle Gass adds flavor on guitar. Dave Grohl (Nirvana, Foo Fighters) provides amazing drums on several tracks. I would name some favorite tracks, but I like them all. Pick this up today. You will not regret it."
5,Tenacious D rock,"I advise everyone to buy this amazin CDTenacious D r the best thing since blink-182i rate it 5 stars , it rocks"
2,D gets a C,"2 1/2TD's debut might be the only bit of Yankovician music I can appreciate, but even with a few songs that completely outshine their comedic confines, the album becomes a chore to sit through by the time it has finished."
4,Jack and Kyle are funny.,"I had never heard of Tenacious D until reading an interview with them in The Onion A/V Club. Never one to buy that many comedy CD's, I did buy this one because the interview made me laugh. I wasn't disappointed.Their comedy stylings are somewhat reminiscent of Adam Sandler's They're All Gonna Laugh At You and What The Hell Happened To Me. Tencacious D is mostly funny songs and brief ""skits.""After listening to this CD exstensively for a week I feel that it was worth the price of purchase. Will I listen to it again? Probably only to show my friends how funny they are.If you're not a fan of Adam Sandler or other comedy in that category, don't buy this album. If you are, its right up your alley."
2,"Desert Roses and Arabian Rhythms, Vol. 1","I enjoy the more traditional arabic collections. I think this is more of a collection of western music with Arabic influence, than true Arabic music. I recommend Arabic Groove, and other Putumayo collections, instead."
2,So where's the suspense?,"...I suppose the characters are nice enough, if implausible, and I did want to see them end up together. But the suspense part of the plot was nonexistant, and the ending and villains telegraphed themselves from the begiining...."
1,Stereotypical rubbish,"This book does little more than propagate the myths and stereotypes of the alleged sorcery ""Gypsies"" or the Roma perform/ed. One would do much better to go to the Patrin website and see what the Roma are really about.Leland does himself, and the Gypsy Lore Society (of which he was president) a great disservice. However you must remember that this book was written in the 19th Century, and has to be viewed in the light of the thinking of the time.It cannot be seen as historically correct in any way."
4,gypsy sorcery and fortune telling,"this holds extensive knowledge and overviews of many romany cultures, from beginning to end, an excellent and compelling and informative read and referencebook."
1,Don't even try...,I bought this camera at compusa - the quality is so poor. I was fooled by the idea of having mobile cam - that's kind of neat. But of course I don't want to sacrifice the quality - so I am back using logitech.
2,"Alas, the heroine is a pill","I really wanted to like this book- the story had the potential to be fun and interesting. The supporting cast were quirky. The hero was boring, but hot (which is kinda par for the course with romance novels). The problem centered on the heroine. She was not even a little bit fun to read about. In a book with a light-hearted premise, and a fairly light tone for most of it, all of her scenes were just brutal. This book had too much melodrama- our heroine has been severely traumatised by things in her past- not frivolous things, but something truly heartbreaking. I spent the whole book thinking that the woman should be going into serious therapy, not a relationship. When I finished the book I was left thinking that if this was a relationship in real life, they would be divorced in a year and I would not be surprised.I suggest giving this one a pass."
4,Cool Jam,Dr.Dre&Dj Quik on the Boards with Rakim on the Hook to this Cut which was happening for a good minute.Addictive was a nice Beat&Groove cut.good use of the BT Express Beats.
4,Interesting Documentary,Great for anyone interested in how the Western Diet is affecting the overall health of our nation and how changing eating habits can literally save a person's life.
4,Pretty Good!,"This book was pretty good, informative and useful. It's good data to have. I also recommend ""How to Make Fast Cash in Real Estate with No Money Down Deals,"" by: Rod L. Griffin"
5,It will make you want to know more...,"With so many ways to buy real estate, these two authors found a method that works and are sharing it here. The book clearly and concisely describes the method(s) that they have successfully used for years. They even go as far as giving you the words to say when talking to potential sellers...a really great value for someone who is new to investing. Maybe if more investors took the time to get educated with materials such as this one, it would raise the level of professionalism in our industry."
