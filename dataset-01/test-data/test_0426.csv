5,De La Pra Ca = Love Brought Us Here,"""De La Pra Ca"" is the Title by Som Livre (Brazilian pressing),the one by Pacific Coast Highway (Japanese pressing) is ""Love Brought Us Here"". They're the same, and them both are an excellent example of the quality Brazilian Jazz, Rique Pantoja has us accostumed to. The phenomenal keyboards are there, his vocals in Portuguese and English are there; his guests are first class:- Rique Pantoja / Piano, Synthesizers, Vocals, Compositions, Production, Arrangements- Ernie Watts / Alto Sax, Tenor Sax- Lee Ritenour / Acoustic Guitars- Ricardo Silveira / Guitars- Alex Acuna /Drums- Phil Perry / Vocals- Don Grusin / Additional Synthesizers, Computer Programming- Arturo Maia / Bass- Paulinho DaCosta / PercussionsAnd on top of that: a true classic that's now Almost-impossible-to-find and a Collectible; so if you're already a fan of Rique's and/or love good Jazz/Brazilian Jazz, this gem has got to be in your collection.Extremely recommendable."
1,"Not So Good ""-""","I have been playing guitar for a couple of yers now, so I was looking to use this not for the the lessons (which seemed fine) but rather for the music writing party of it and the feature that helps learn a song looked pretty cool also. The price was cheap, and that should have set off the warning alarm. It came with no instructions, their webpage (which was almost all in German)had a very limited selection of songs to choose from and whats more, you had to pay in order to be able to download songs to learn. The jam room was practically impossible to use due to the fact that there were no instructions whatsoever, and within three days, this piece of junk was off my comp and sitting on a shelf, never to be released again.Folks, save your cash. Trust me, it's not worth it. As I have learned, if you want to write your music, paper and pencil work much better than this does."
2,Don't buy it!,"This album makes me upset. There was a beautiful wonderful album already released with the brilliant Donna Murphy and then the producers put this out to compete with it? Why would they do that? Get the one with Donna Murphy, you won't regret it."
2,Didn't resonate with me,"Alain de Botton attempts to describe the emotions and sensations of travel, but his impressions didn't ring true for me. An example: he is in Madrid, and he complains that he feels ""self-disgust at the contrast between my own indolence and what I imagined would have been the eagerness of more normal travelers."" Consequently, he stays in bed, finally leaving his room only because he doesn't want to encounter the maid again, who keeps trying to clean his room.I get the impression that de Botton has problems. An interesting book could have made about this topic - a neurotic traveler coping with the rigors of travel - but as ruminations on ""the art of travel,"" the book doesn't work for me, simply because I don't share his reactions to his environment or his seeming inability to enjoy himself.I recently read an interesting article by Alain de Botton on the art of conversation. I do find him a compelling writer, though this book was not for me."
5,The best smooth jazz from 1998,"Gregg Karukas is one the major keyboards in smooth jazz at this time and probably Blue touch may be one of his greatest achievements.. This album has no holes.Blue touch is a solid work, with many interesting tracks. My favorite one is Fly away. However you'll be widely reward with this buy. Every track is carefully played, with a sense of rhytm and harmony as a few.Karukas belongs to a selected dinasty of keyboard players that never let you down , because he renews in every work he throws.Undobtly a musician with a huge foture, because his skillness, wide sense of the form and over all he never lets you dissapointed.He and Brian Culbertson are from now the great white hope in smooth jazz keyboard."
5,Great ball for great price,"This is a great ball for a great price. I play outdoor but my daughter plays indoor, both of us agree that it has a great feel."
4,Great Ball,"Hands down the best indoor ball out there for touch, feel, and consistency. My only complaint is durability, the ball will get scratched and the seams will start to come apart after a while. It'll still play ok but after a while it's just time to get a new one."
2,Completely Pass'e,"This looks at men in the military who eventually get training as nurses. It was written long before the rise of Black Studies or Men's Studies. Thus, the insights from these fields are not present here. The work is dated and the writing is dull. This really just compiled information with no finesse. I'm a Black male and numerous articles say Black males suffer disproportionately in bad labor markets or when old skills become obsolete. That is the one way in which this book could have use four decades after its publication: speaking of finding jobs or skills for disempowered bruthas. Perhaps a student could compare the info here with current research or writing on Black male nurses and produce a comparative paper on the topic. There is a small chance that male who receive nursing training in the military might find this book useful."
5,Product does the job,"I use these cute tablecloth weights on my table at the beach club where it is constantly buffeted around by the offshore breeze and storms and rained on too. I leave these on 24/7. They are heavy enough to keep the tablecloth down and hold on tight. It's been one month and they still look good, not rusting. (Everything else I tried either flew away or rusted after a couple of weeks and fell off.) I'll let u know if they make it to the end of the summer."
4,Explore. Dream. Discover,What a good time I had with this one. One could not help but cheer for the good guys.If only I could give it 4 1/2 stars
4,Time travel to an interesting setting,"Not a fast paced book, but one that seemed realistic if you can get past time travel caused by a lightening strike.The central character is an ordinary Joe in TX unexpectedly sent a thousand years into the past. Texas consists of mostly uninhabited plains and wildlife. If he ignores present day development, the guy figures out where and about when he is at and eventually settles on a plan to save his life in a totally different kind of world compared to his prior couch potato life style. He adapts and survives.I think the author put some thought and research into this book and it shows.I have a variety of time travel books in my collection. This is one of the better ones. Read it twice now. With a little more time, I look forward to reading it again.If the author wrote more books with the same concept, but different locales, it might make an interesting series. I wonder how he would make the Pacific NW appear long ago?"
1,Cashing in on image makes bad music.,"Heard the CD and it's awful. Seen them live a few times and they're awful. What's worse is that they are fronting the entire ""jazz"" act because they seem to find it funny! Oh yeah, baby, jazz is a real hoot. Parker and Monk had'em rollin' in the aisles! Billie Holiday was the first female stand up comedian, did you know that? I betcha didn't!Anyway, it's no good. Halfa$$ed and silly, these kids wouldn't take their own deaths seriously, let alone the music they play, record, and subsequently mock. Sorry teenagers, try not to be so cute next time."
2,Not Exactly Molded nor Custom Fit,"The pictures and video looked very close to the factory mudguards. I was completely wrong! I had to drill some holes extra holes, and position it a certain way to even fit. In the end, I just removed them because the look wasn't right. Same some your money and just buy the factory OEM mudguards. It will save you some time during installation, and look better.Two stars just because the material of the mudguards it quite good. Otherwise I would rate zero stars for the fit and look."
2,Rear 'molded' Mud Flaps - not what it appears,I searched and reviewed several befor purchasing these on the web. I ordered specific for my model and wanted them to match the factory ones on the front. Based on the title and picture they appeared to be exactly what I wanted; but when I received them they were 'custom formed' on the fender side - yet OPEN on the tire side. They did not match so I had to purchase a good quality set of rubber mats and glue them to the tire side to make them look a bunch better. Not sure what the manufacturer was thinking since the tire side would collect mud and snow on the exposed lip.
3,"Good read, but for the characters","This was a better read than the 3 stars I gave it. The characters were very well developed and Wood did an excellent job of developing the different worlds within the book (the domed cities, destroyed cities, the desert)--you were there. Many of the passages within destroyed Philadelphia, the tunnel families, and the confrontation with the rangers were vividly painted and made for rapid page turning. What I couldn't quite get over was the real lack of redeeming qualities in the main characters. Berk was more of a self-centered, self destructive individualist rather than an idealistic pioneer. And Sadonya...you just had to try and understand how a violent and vicious environment and upbringing can create a person absent of any compassion or regard for humanity. If your stories don't need heroes, you may enjoy the book immensely. If you like to root for the protagonists, you may come away a little lacking."
5,The best cd in my collection,"I am a David Allan Coe fan. I definitely see the comparisons, not so much in sound, but Dallas Moore is to this generation what DAC was to his. I bought this and ""High on the Hog"" after seeing Dallas Moore open for DAC. I have had ""Untold Stories"" for about a month now and hadn't listened to it until today because ""High on the Hog"" was so good. Well, after listening to this, it is nothing like ""High on the Hog"". This is all acoustic, but may very well be the single best cd in my cd collection. If you like the candy ... ""barbecue stain on my white t-shirt"" country music, this cd is not for you. If you like great songwriting and great country music, this is for you. In fact, the reason you don't hear Dallas Moore on country radio is simply the reason you don't hear DAC on country radio- They are too ... good and would threaten the ""nashville puppets""."
4,Worth An Encore,"I bought this CD on the strength of the list of guest musicians. Unfortunately, the best known appear on only one track each. It did take me quite a while to get into the music but now that I've heard the disc a dozen times or so, I find it to be about as good as I originally expected.There is less of the blues and more of the jazz here but that does not detract. My favorite tracks are the hard-driving Watching Your Every Move which features some searing sax and guitar work and Hidden Agenda which is carried by Jack Bruce's otherworldly vocal style. Spooky But Nice offers some memorable guitar work by the legendary Mick Taylor. And throughout the CD, Heckstall-Smith's sax virtuosity is on display.My only criticisms of the album are that it lacks direction and cohesion and that Mayall, Green, Taylor and Bruce were not more widely featured. Overall, Blues and Beyond is a fine effort well worth an encore."
2,Time Travel on a Budget,"When the bottom-line industrialist bankrolling their time-travel project threatens to shut them down, a group of scientists push their equipment too far, with the result that their entire lab is thrown through time and space. They become embroiled in a future war, then wind up in the time of Giant Lizards (because that sure ain't no dinosaur). Pretty good zero-budget sci-fi, with a great B-movie cast: Anthony Eisley, Scott Brady and Lyle Waggoner. The sort of picture that used to crop up on TV late saturday afternoons or 3AM in the morning."
4,This is Old School! (That's a good thing!),"I used to love this game when I was a little kid! It's cool because it is actually 4 games on one cartridge! Super Mario Bros., Mario Bros. 2, Mario Bros. 3, and Lost Levels. The best mario is still Super Marioworld though(sold on a separate cartridge.) There isn't much else to say, except these were the good mario games before they came out with the less-than-exceptional N64 ones."
5,OH YEAH,"Finally, the game everybody's waiting for. Actually games, since this is a 4 in one game!!! When I first got my SNES, Super Mario World and Super Mario All Stars came with it. Mario World 3 is probably the best, because there are 8 worlds, many secret places, and a 2 player battle function, which rocks!In Mario land 2, well, it's the one where you are able to grasp items from the ground. There's not too much excitement in that game.But both Secret levels and original Mario are nearly alike, except that Mario Secret levels is soooo hard to aquire in other systems.I love this game, and suggest it to everyone, because everybody likes Mario games, don't they???"
5,Quite a Super collection! Third Generation Gaming brought to the Fourth Generation!,"Those who have grown up with these games (Super Mario Bros. 1,2, & 3) have developed a nostalgia and fondness of them, even younger gamers can respect the name of this beloved Nintendo franchise as Mario is the official Nintendo mascot. This game combines all of these games plus the lost levels in 16 bit goodness! The game is as fun as it was back in ""The Fourth Generation of Gaming.""BOTTOM LINE: What more can you want? You have: 1. Classic games 2.Improved graphics and sound 3. Bounuses BUY IT NOW FELLOW RETRO-GAMERS! 10/10"
2,0 for 2 on This Fan,"Wow, do I ever regret this purchase. The first fan we brought home had a defective motor, in that the fan would only work in reverse. We returned it and received a replacement, but the replacement is now making a weird clicking sound that kind of comes and goes. When it's clicking at night, when we're trying to sleep, it's loud enough to actually wake up and keep us up. We've tried putting foam in between the ceiling and the metal cover, and a strip of rubber around the ball joint, and we made sure it was weighted and balanced properly, and we just can't resolve the issue. I only hope I can return it, otherwise that's nearly $300 wasted. And yes, we installed ourselves, but this was the 4th ceiling fan we've installed, and none of the others have given us any trouble at all.On the plus side, it does move a lot of air, and when it's not clicking, it's pretty quiet. If you don't get a lemon, like we did twice, it might be a very nice fan. If you purchase, I wish you luck....."
3,"good product, bad manual","I have used this software now for a week and am still struggling with it. I think the product is powerful, maybe too many features for my needs, but figuring out how to use it is really tough. The users manual was clearly written by someone for whom English is a second (maybe third) language. If you are willing to make the effort to fight through this, you can do a lot. I have now used the note processor like a word processor to document music I have written and I have entered music from the virtual keyboard. It is so much nicer than my handwriting."
1,Hard to comprehend,"Maybe I haven't been persistent enough, but I found this program nearly unusable. On-screen symbols are not immediately obvious, and the manual often makes no sense at all."
4,Powerful for the price - Docs useless,"This program took me a long time to learn to use, but it is now my favorite. I can import midis and print music to play in my brass band with only a few clicks. It is a resource hog, so don't use the mimimum system requirements. It runs great in XP on a P4. Use the styles print music for diffent instruments without changing how the midi sounds. Use the qua to get rid of annoying sixteenth note rests. Rather than use the pen tool always use the select tool and right click to enter notes on the score. If you miss, drag the note into place. Warning - don't expect any help from the documentatation - even the font names are in German."
1,MAGIX notation - don't bother,"This software only allows one note duration to be displayed per line at any point in the music! If you enter an eighth note and a half note at the same spot, it shows both as an eighth note! The picture on the front is very misleading - the music sample they have shows a half note and quarter notes at the same point and you can't enter it that way. (It plays OK but doesn't look right at all!)Totally useless for entering music for printing. It only gets one star because there's no such thing as a zero star."
4,classic g funk,loved how goldie loc and tray dee put it down with kokane spitting that old planet rock hook old fashoined way indeed also koka does his sir dogg impersonation and snoop does snoopy collins keeping tha p in the funk.
4,The Wrangler's Woman,This was an interesting story line. I got started and didn't want to put it down. Enough suspence to keep you interested. Enough fact to seem real. I really enjoyed it.
1,"The Horror, the Horror!","One star is too generous. The fact that this collection was published is the most horrifying thing about this entire book. The great majority of the stories are incoherent and poorly edited (perhaps the editor cared for the material about as much as I did). A fellow reviewer described the tales as vague and that's the perfect adjective to use. The stories are not particularly frightening either, although some were certainly disturbing. Save yourself some ducats and test drive it for yourself at your local library. This book is, to quote from the immortal Opus Penguin, ""simply bad beyond all infinite dimensions of possible badness....well maybe not that bad, but Lord, it wasn't good."""
1,do not buy,"read the first review, I sign under every word. Unfortunately I saw the review too late. Now I need to find out how to return this piece of junk"
5,A great read,I received my book in excelent condition. it was a great read. Highly recommend it to those die-hard Cher fans like me
1,A Ridiculous Portrayal of War,This movie is overdramatized and ridiculous. How can a person who has been malnourished have the strength to scramble around evading an enemy force? Try not eating and drinking small amounts of dirty water for a week and see how strong you are at the end of it. If you really want to experience war then get off the couch and go see it for yourself then talk about the evils of war.
5,Barbra: Essentially the Best,"What's one of the many intriguing things about this collection of 40 classic songs? Listening to how her voice has changed over the past four decades. Her earlier recordings showcased a raw, comedic voice that grew to its richest sound by the time she recorded ""Yentl"" and ""The Broadway Album"". And now as she is turning 60, notice how her voice has gotten deeper, almost sounding hoarse at times, on the emotional track ""You'll Never Walk Alone"".The remastered songs from the sixties are real standouts. You can definitely hear the technical improvements made on ""Second hand Rose"".This is a must have for any Streisand fan, as well as anyone who appreciates this style of music.Another interesting note: Inside the cover, many of her albums are pictured along with some other great photographs. I don't know if this was done on purpose or simply a mistake, but ""My Name Is Barbra Two"" is included twice on the same page."
4,What's Missing Here?,"Lots of great songs are here, it's a great price for a two CD set, there are some really good pictures inside, what went wrong? It somehow seems to be lacking in passion. It's a ""let's throw them all in together and see if it floats....?"" kinda thing. I'm glad to have a lot of these songs all in one place, and I've always been a fan, but I can't help feeling a little let down. I should have loved this, I WANTED to love this, it has been a long time since I hooked up with Barbra music.Maybe she's bored with us, too.....?????"
2,RECYCLED DIVA,How much money is she getting a year and she has not recorded a real original cd in years? Christmas cd was less christmas than normal. Live cds were good but mostly recycled .I do love the voice and the lady but refuse to spend another penny on her till she releases something NEW.dvd of old tv shows would really be nice cause the songs are not being worn out!
2,not enough hits,"Even as a fan of Barbra, I think there are only on few songs on these two cd's that I look forward to hearing. Those are really good, but the others are just mediocre, songs I have never heard before. But the price is right."
1,Not the picture,"The picture does not reflect what was sent in the mail. We received a white sunhat, no cap or cover in the back. We used the hat because we had no time to purchase another one. Just beware that the pictures is not what you will get."
4,Nice,"My son is 9 months old and recently went to the beach in sunny Brazil. Between sand and waves, the hat stuck along with him during the whole day! I am glad I bought it."
3,good but floppy,I like the iplay sunhat. It is adjustable and I love that it ties under the chin. It provides good protection from the sun. My 9 month old doesn't like me to put it on her but once I get it on long enough to distract her she doesn't mind it. The only problem I found with the hat is that the front visor is not hard (like a baseball cap is) allowing it to flop down and obstruct her view which makes her realise she has it on and of course want to pull it off.
4,Love the hat,"Great hat. Offers great coverage for my 6 month old.Material is nice and soft and it washes well , did not shrink.It also stays on his head with the tie is and its adjustable. I think it will probably fit him until he is at least 3 cause it has room to grow into."
4,Baby Sunhat,"Although this is a little big on my 7 mo old, it does the job of keeping his very blonde head sunburn free and the sun out of his eyes."
4,Beginners are Welcomed,"This is a very lite version of Magix Music Maker. The loops are not compatible with other Magix Music Maker programs. When using the loops with other Magix Music Maker programs the programs seem to freeze or lag(I have a 2.8 P4 Sony Vaio Laptop with a ATI Radeon graphics with 512 memory on a 40 gig Hard Drive).This is a great beginners program it is simple and easy to understand. The loops are perfect for kids. This version of Magix contains alot of computer animated cartoons and simple music loops. The music loops are kinda cheesy ,but this is a kids program. Do not expect anything special for adults."
1,Broke within days...,"I put this in my car and it was not the easiest to put in anyhow, but it broke within just a few days..not happy about it."
3,Too many camera cuts,"Some of the music is pretty good and the video quality tops the previous DVD BUT... the insane amount of camera angle cuts drove me nuts! No kidding, the camera switches views every two seconds - one, two CUT, one two CUT, for perhaps 90% of the run time. Still, a couple of beers may enhance your viewing experience by calming your traumatized retinas. :-)"
4,CD of a great!,The CD came in with no blemishes but since my last experiecne did not go so well (cracked case) I'm giving it a 4 STAR ...
5,I love it.,It came pretty quickly. The case was a little rough looking but the CD and everything else was in perfect working order. I am satisfied.
5,The Very Best of the Very Best,"Ella Fitzgerald was quite simply the greatest vocalist to ever grace the earth with her presence. Her intonation and pitch were breathtakingly perfect, each note melting away into her delicate vibrato. Her range was wide and her vocal quality consistent throughout it. She had the most sublime sense of swing you will ever hear. She could move you to tears just by the sheer beauty of her voice. Her voice was joy.And that being said, this is the best sampler of the great Ella. It has a nice selection of both her swingers and ballads. It displays her warmth, her tenderness. One minute she is caressing you with ""Misty"" or ""Love is Here to Stay,"" or she is taking your breath away with the sheer beauty of ""Blue Skies,"" or blowing your mind with amazing scat on ""How High the Moon.""I can guarantee you, after you listen to this CD you will want to go out and buy every Ella album available. :)"
1,Boring,"The best parts of the movie are the previews; all 20 seconds of them. Flat acting, very boring, and one member of the team who has 0 lines..hmmm"
3,book,Bool cover looked like it was cut with a pair of scissors on the front. About a couple of inches. Paid for new book which did not come in new condition.
1,poor product,One month after i received this product it started coming loose off my gun. II looked online and realize when I received my item the proper hardware was not included which caused this poorly made shellholder to strip out. Now because of this I am left with a usless peice of plastic. Dissapointed. Waste of my money next time will take the extra effort and buy an item like this at my local store where I will receive real service and get what I paid for. Would not reccomend to a friend. Pay a few extra dollars and take a trip to your local gun shop to get yourself a quality product instead.
2,Won't stay on.,On my mossberg 500 you have to take this off to clean it. After two cleanings it will no longer stay on the shotgun. The screw that mounts it is stripped out. I only had it for about a month.
3,great gag gift for wife!,I bought this as a gag christmas gift and my wife thought it was humorous. But it would be easy for children to read and get into also
4,3 and a half stars for a helpful book!,"As a 12 year old just begging to think of boys in any romantic way, this book helped a lot with crushes, imtroducing yourself, dealing with friends who are jelous, ect, ect. Then, once you gte into a relashionship, there is a big question mark. I would still reccomend this book, but only for 11-13 year olds who havn't had a real relashionship yet."
4,It is really good,I have loads of american girl books at home this book was really really good i recomend this book for under 12s
5,A must have for girls just before middle school,"I have a 10yo daughter. I found this book to be empowering and straight forward. It dealt with issues I did not know how to articulate to her in an age appropriate manner. I found it to be just informative enough but not too much. It celebrated girl hood but acknowledged and assisted with the awkward period of learning how to relate to boys. I loved the advise like ""don't have a girlfriend talk to the boy for you"" and stuff like that. And, it did not promote inappropriate behavior but simply dealt with those emerging feelings and adjustments that occur."
1,Bloated,"Don't let me get on my high horse, but this lumbering beast really should have been strangled at birth. I'm partial to a good sestina, but there's nothing worse than a pointless one. Part 3 in particular (a kind of deformed 'verse' novel) had an awful long gestation period and it shows - laboured, pedestrian, incoherent. And I do feel her editor let her down by allowing the word 'explicitated' (in the end note). This is an ill-conceived vanity project that does the cause of poetry no good at all. Cute cover pic though!"
4,Very cute,I bought this for my son and he loves using these as pillows when he goes to bed. He loves it. Thank you
5,In a Class by Himself,"I was looking for Silvard's With Love, vol. 2 because I had heard Unchained Melody on the radio. I was so disappointed to find only vol. 1. But today I received the cd and it does indeed have 2 cds, vol. 1: Somewhere in Time, The rose, Love Story Theme, Love is Blue, Mona Lisa, Yesterday/ Let It Be, The Last, Farewell, Over the Rainbow, She's Always a Woman, Endless Love, Watermark. Vol 2. Phantom of the Opera, A Time for Us, Time in a Bottle, Unchained Melody, The Shadow of your smile, Desperado, Just the Way you Are, As Time Goes By, Are You Lonesome Tonight, Dr. Zhivago, Killing Me Softly, Misty.Silvard is indeed in a class by himself. Highly recommended."
1,Wish review was different,Length:: 0:40 MinsSeller said I received what I was supposed to so I will review what I received. The item is not Premium Grade Sand... Looks more like Arena Grade. It is to sharp and to large to be a premium grade sand. Item isn't sanitized as it claims to be with bleach or heat to kill off bacteria and living organisms in the sand it is at most maybe screened and washed with just water. All in all this sand was a major disappointment based off what I paid for shipping and the sand. I will buy a different brand from someone else next time to make sure the sand has what is advertised. Maybe I will see if Amazon is selling any sand themseves next time instead of tis brand/seller combo. I bet Amazon sand would be higher quality.
3,Re-Release of an earlier version,"Unless you have the original 1999 release, released on Deadline Records - then there is no point in picking this up. The original version/release was entitled: ""The Lost Years"" with the exact same track listing. More or less out of print now - but to re-release it now for fans who didn't pick up the Lost Years version is a nice collection.You can reference the original version here: [...]"
5,A definite buy. No one else makes broadway sound so good.,"Barbra's extraordinary talent and passion for broadway music is outstanding and she sings it beautifully. She has heightened the sounds of broadway and made the music such a pleasure to enjoy. Thank you Barbra, for being ""The Voice"" of our time and giving us so much of your talent. Your outstanding music, movies and passion for both are the greatest gift an entertainer can give its fans. You are incredibly talented!"
4,Classic Streisand,She began on Broadway and you can hear her styling and acting come through the songs even though they were recorded in a studio. She is Great!!!
4,Works well.,This grill works well as no water needs to be added and still keeps smoke down. You need to clean the grill after every use and follow the prep instructions to keep the grilling area clean.
1,Very Dissapointed,"I received nothing!I'm really dissapointed because this was a birthday present and I would receive the watch within 4 weeks. Now it's week 5 and I still haven't received the watch or other information about it. I tried to contact Chelsea watches for several times, but I don't get any respond. The birthday was yesterday and I had nothing to give and no money to buy anything else like this.I still try to get in touch with Chelsea watches..Still hoping to give a positive rating."
3,Beautiful but HUGE!!,"My first watch purchase online and last. I was very excited upon receiving the watch but when I opened the package to my surprise the watch was way to heavy and big to be a womens watch. It was almost the size of my husband's watch but heavier. It was very disappointing and it was returned. I ended up purchasing a similiar guess watch but smaller in a dept. store and now I happy with my purchase. Recommendation, if you purchase online check it out in the store first if possible then order, you will avoid pricey return shipping fees."
1,cheap,"Got this for my girlfriend's new phone. It's not as likeable up close. It is cheap plastic with no trim. Although it would protect you phone, it's just too bulky and ugly to use."
1,Makes my roots look greasy!,I had high hopes for this product as the reviews were stellar. Maybe it's my hair type? But the product made my hair look greasy...even with being very careful to avoid the roots. And the last of instruction on the label is disappointing. Waste of money and will pass it along to a friend to try. :(
1,Uninspired academic hackwork for Chinese kids,"Environmentalism and species protection are good things. There must be thousands of ways to write a children's book on the subject which result in an entertaining text and imaginative illustrations. This is not one of them. I had bought it as a gift for someone, but I could not give it because I disapproved of the pedestrian text and dull illustrations."
2,Not for me.,"I'm not a techno-person and I bought this CD based soley on the reviews I read... 'Experiance Expanded' is just about 2 hours in lenght and really upbeat. Sort of a hip-hoppy-transic type of feel goes through the entire cd, which gets a little exhausted after the first 3 or 4 tracks. Some songs are remixed and repeated as well. I imagine this would only be entertaining if you were high or at a rave. I'm more into alternative/punk music, so 'Experiance Expanded' just wasn't my thing... but if you dig this stuff, buy it."
2,Not the same Prodigy,"I became a Prodigy fan after hearing Fat of the Land, so I was looking forward to this album. However, this album lacks the same energy and uniqueness. If the songs from this new album get any play time on the radio, you would not recognize the music as Prodigy. Experience Expanded sounds lame."
4,Beginner's How-To Manual for any person new to network marketing,"Zig explains network marketing in simple, easy to understand terms. In chapter 5, ""Evaluating Network Marketing Companies"", Zig discusses several questions a person should ask to whether they are pursing the right network marketing company.Also, in chapter 10, ""Knowing What to Do After You Sign Up"" was very helpful for me in taking the next step."
3,School Book,This book is somewhat dated (2006) to be useful in the field. I bought it for a class otherwise it is boring and not up to date.
5,an amazing discovery,"Just curiosity put me to buy this book.I definitely love language topics and it was an amazing surprise for me.As a matter of fact I would never thought how many words coming from egyptian language survive in ours own through the intermediate of arabic.I suggest all the people interesting in improve their knowledges (and ,of course,spending some time ,learning and enjoing)to get this item.Keep up the good job!"
3,Good and Bad,"Having accepted that these small zoom binoculars can't do everything well, these are not too bad as compared to others in similar price range. One big problem for me (I am returning them) is that they are not for somebody with eyes close together. I need another 1/8"" of inward travel for them to match my eye distances, so they are therefore useless to me. Like all zooms I have looked at, they need a little center wheel focus adjust between max and min magnifications, but these were seemingly better than many I viewed, and the right eye adjustment seemed to stay put as it should. While the electronic zoom is nice and does not seem to add to weight or size much, I probably prefer a manual zoom just because it is faster, assuming that the manual control is located in a good spot, and many are not. The price dropped a day or so after I bought mine, so now they are even a better deal and worth the price for sure... just be sure that your eye distance is more normal than mine."
4,Metra 99-300G,The Metra 99 3000G fit like a factory part the only problem with it was the color was a little darker because mine had faded over the years.
2,Routines from the 1980's,"I didn't like most of the routines on this tape, but if you like Tonya Harding, Midori Ito, Tiffany Chin, Brian Boitano, Christopher Bowman and so on, you might enjoy it better than I did. There were a few good pairs routines by Dmitrev and his old partner, for example, but nothing here that brings down the house."
5,"Great, Awesome",A great group one that i hope stays together for a long time and continues to put out outstanding CD's like this one
3,Liked the book but...,"I did like this book - I read it in one sitting - however, I find it difficult to believe that in this day and time the police in 1 city (not to mention 2!) would be as condescending to a domestic crime victim as they are in this book and would not take wife/child abuse accusations seriously. Other than that this book is a suspenseful, fast read, with the reader wondering if Sharon is being stalked or is it the newly resurrected Janice Young?"
2,Implausible Story Line,"I actually requested this book from my local library based on the many good reviews posted here. I was very disappointed with the story line. In this age of high tech survellance, it seems to me extremely unlikely that a person could do what the main character in this story accomplishes. It takes a real suspension of one's common sense to enjoy this book, as it asks you to believe that a person could (totally at random) take on the identity of another person who looks uncannily like her and is in the same business. Puleeeze...this did it for me for the remainder of the book. Hard to finish it as I couldn't get beyond the purported 'coincidences'."
1,Bad Quality and too bulky,"At first look seemed to be good because offer the oportunity to have the earphones with you all the time. But, it is too bulky and the earphones do not fit very well in the case. Is a messy. Finally the case broke in 1.5 months of use (at up-front)"
3,"Gets the job done, with a few annoyances","Just got the jacket. The phone fits snugly into it, and it appears that it will protect the phone (except the screen of course) from cosmetic damage from dropping, putting in your pocket w/ keys, etc. I ordered screen protectors in addition to this jacket.A few gripes, as other reviewers have mentioned: phone won't fit in the cradle with the jacket on. Also, power/sleep button and volume appear as if they might be a tad harder to work with the sleeve on, but they do work.Overall I'd recommend getting it, as you need to protect your hardware and right now there are not a lot of options. Griffin has a sweet leather flip-up case for the iPod touch...I wish they would put one of those babies out for the iPhone."
5,Omnicide Cover Art,"Love, love, love that cover art!The artwork is done by Siobhan Scheier who can be viewed on her online portfolio at www.ArtWanted.com/shuvon."
4,"Twelve Extraordinary Women: How God Shaped Women of the Bible, and What He Wants to Do with You","I'm still getting through this book, but I find it very very useful for the middle school girls' Bible study that I lead with two other women. It gives me a lot more insight into the lives of biblical women than I would otherwise have, and that helps us to have good discussion in Bible studies. At times, however, the author is a bit wordy and seems to repeat his points in some of the chapters. Overall, it's a great resource and helps me learn more about being a woman and a Christian."
1,Awful is the best I can say,"I read and enjoyed MacArthur's Twelve Ordinary Men but found this book extremely distasteful on many levels. We used it in a women's bible study group and none of us have enjoyed it. It's extremely sexist in nature (and believe me, I'm not usually sensitive about that sort of thing). The About the Author section in the back pretty much sums up his attitude through the entire book when it writes John is the father of ""four children (all married)"" as if being married is the sum of their identity. And as other have said, not only does it not include the Catholic view, it goes so far as to say regarding some Catholic views that they are ""arrogant presumptions.""I'm a fan of MacArthur but cannot recommend this book to ANYONE!"
2,not a good book,"I did not care for this book. Some of the content in this book is not only wrong, but insulting! The chapter on Mary is particularly offensive. I could not even read it. I would not recommend this book to others."
5,I haven't actually got the product...BUT....,"I don't really own this particular product, but I would really LOVE to find this series on DVD!!! I read in one of these reviews that there are ones out there, but WHERE?!?!? Help me! I'd like them ALL!!!"
4,Bonnie Consolo,"While this was filmed in the '70's, it is still an amazing video. Great to show to high school students."
5,Advice for business and life,"The Wisdom of Ginsu is not only an entertaining trip back to those nostalgic days of late-night infomercials, it's also got great advice for people of all ages and all walks of life. Whether you're starting a business or just taking a vacation, the ""Ginsuisms"" that Barry and Ed write about are pertinent to all kinds of situations. A fun and instructive read!"
4,Great pictures but skimpy text,"This book features many great pictures of a wide variety of the Mack B apparatus. Unfortunately, the text is sparse and gives very little of the background information that one would expect and as is common in other Iconografix titles."
5,BONES!!,Bones is one of the greatest shows on tv today! All of the characters work great together and I love seeing Booth and Brennan together! This season is amazing!
2,Bones has contracted osteoporosis,"Instead of staying focused on a forensic anthropologist and her team using science and facts to bring criminals to justice the writers of this show have become more focused on promoting their scientific theories, political agenda, religious believes, cultural preferences and behavioral styles through this series. They diseased a solid ""Bones"" structure with the osteoporosis of their prejudices rendering it a thin, brittle, disfigured skeleton of ""Bones""."
5,Fantastic episode,This was an excellent episode. I love the use of Pelant and think he makes a great adversary for the Jeffersonian team. I can't wait to see him in future episodes and how they finally catch and get rid of him. This episode his close to home and you could really see how Hodgins was affected by it. The way that he had to make a choice between being bankrupt or saving those girls lives (of course he would choose life over money) shows what is really important in life.
5,I <3 this show!,It's just a great show. Missed this one on TV so I was totally excited to find it on Amazon. :)
5,Great quality,Quality was great. Delivery no different than watching from a DVD. Glad it was available because the cliffhanger ended on Netflix and I wanted to know what happened. Nice to have this option. Thanks Amazon.
5,Bones Season 8,"Great season! Missed some episodes on tv, but was able to watch them on amazon. Wish they were cheaper though"
4,Grand images,The images are brilliantly printed with stunning details. I even liked the format whereby the equipment used were listed together with the image.Excellent book for inspiration.
3,A Little Disappointing,"The Big House provides a graphically detailed and insightful look at ""life inside a supermax security prison"" just like the cover says.I was a little disappointed however, that Warden James Bruton seemed to spend more time patting himself on the back than actually writing about what we bought the book to read. He seemed to spend entirely too much time describing how problems of other prisons don't exist at HIS prison, and how well he cleaned up the place.That is great, and I am sure there are many lessons there for other wardens or correctional officials but that is not what I was interested in reading. I wish he had spent more detail (and pages) focusing on the life and experiences of the inmates and less on what a great job he did.I would still recommend this book to anyone interested in an ""inside look"" at a supermax prison, but there are others I would suggest reading first."
2,samoan language,i would like to order a book that is telling all old samoan stories and customs and the faasamoa in the samoan language..
2,Not worth the money paid.,"This is basically a very expensive simple first aid guide. If this book only cost $5.00 or less it would be worth the money. This book goes in depth about assessment, which is great, but it does not tell you what to do about items that are found abnormal in the assessment. The information in this book is very vague. I would recommend a better book. This book does fit nicely into a log book binder."
5,PTown Romance & Drama,"Back in P-Town for the sequel of ""Safe Harbor"", Reece Conlon has a new recruit under her wings. Bri Parker, the sheriff's daughter has returned home to join the law enforcement unit of P-Town.Her partner, Caroline has gone to France for a year of education for her degree. They are missing each other and stupid crap starts happening making them doubt each other because they don't get the big picture.Tory is pregnant and still hold down her practice. Reece is working hard on training with Bri; preparing herself for their new bundle of joy; and keeping watch over P-Town.There's lots of hot action in this sequel."
1,Overpriced for small book,I do not suggest anyone to buy this very small book. It's definitely overpriced for the amount of information provided. I couldn't believe how little info was in it for the price. Not a good deal if you ask me.
3,A great CD for Jason and the Scorchers collectors,"Jason and the Scorchers recorded two of the greatest Country-Punk-Rock albums : 'Lost and Found' and 'Fervor'. I was really excited when they released this collection of unreleased and rare material. However, it did not turn out to be the 'huge' album that I hoped it to be. All the previously released material is definitely better in its original then these alternative versions. The live material is a bit 'sloppy' at times and one of the tracks ('Tear it up') is even faded out - a definite 'no-no' for a live recording. The highlights to me are 'Fallen Angel', 'Buried me like a Bone' and the great cover version of 'Ruby, Don't take your love to town'. If you are a Jason and the Scorchers fan, this one should be part of your collection, otherwise try to get 'Both Sides of the Line' which combines the first two releases on one CD."
5,Love that Shrek!,"Who doesn't LOVE Shrek? The trilogy was hours of fun for me. It's a great series for kids, teaches loyalty, that obstacles can be overcome and to have faith in yourself. Yet, as an adult, I love the comedic banter between Shrek & Donkey and the suave & debonair cat is a hysterical! It's a winner for the entire family."
4,Shreck Trilogy,"The Shreck movies have great charm and endearing characters. Unfortunately there is a deterioration as the series proceeds. They try to add a sophistication to Shreck One which frequently misfires for me such as the 'Devil in Prada' Fairy Godmother in Shreck Two. But there is sufficient delight in Puss in Boots, and Donkey with his strange liason to the oversized but loving dragon to hold one's interest, as do Shreck and Fiona. Unfortunately there is a current tendency to insert concepts and images of cruelty and degredation into many stories aimed at the young. The real world is cruel enough without accurately recreating it in fantasy."
2,Not an easy read,"At first glance, this reads like a PH dissertation with footnotes and sources. It wanders from subject to subject without any real closure from the last subject, as if the reader should know how it ends. This doesn't make it completely unreadable, though. I found some interesting thought processes.Remote beliefs of an early people included horned stag gods due to a lifestyle of tending animals for food. All new religions degrade the old religions by demonizing them, and in this case, rams with horns indicate the devil these days. From this, the author jumps into fairies, elves, dwarfs as the original people of the old religion, and how these folk were really us, eventually absorbed into the local populace. From this, we go into witchcraft and covens, the Inquisition and persecution.It's hard to follow, and I'm not sure where it will lead. Because of this, it is easy to put down and walk away."
1,Shattered by Itself,"I bought this as a replacement top. When received it was assembled. After unpacking I did try to tighten the handle which seemed loose but then backed off before setting it down because of suspicion that maybe it was supposed to be that way. In the morning I found that it was totally shattered into a number of pieces. It was fine when set down and was not exposed to any temperature extremes or external stresses afterward. I consider the product design defective and possibly dangerous. Amazon was very quick to give us a refund. I cannot fault them. However, I do feel obligated to inform other potential purchasers since I see that another customer also had a shattering experience."
2,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"I bought ""Sufi Soul"" hoping to be able to show Sufi whirling dance to my students. There is just a few minutes of the ceremony with whirling dervishes presented on the cover. The voice and presence of Simon Broughton fills the whole DVD (even the sacred places which he does not seem able to respect much), except for the extras of little interest for me.For beautiful Sufi music, I recommend ""Ocean of Remembrance"" by Oru Güven and Tümata,now in CD, and I am still looking for a Sufi dance and music ceremony DVD."
3,better off with the other Maxi single,"Being a fan, I have a pre released (Nov. 2004) edition of the single ""Breathe"" and it is excellent, and very inexpensive for all the remixes you get, from ""Pete Heller"" and ""LMC"" a grand total of 9 (that includes the video) You can't go wrong with that maxi ASIN# B00070Q845. This has not been officially released so you boys? you will have to wait a short while, but well worth the wait. Jason Prof DJ"
2,Not for guinea pigs!,"It's ok but I would not recommend it for guinea pigs. Even if it is supposed to be super absorbent, they still poop and it doesn't go anywhere so you have to clean it just as often for a higher price than regular pine shavings."
4,good buy,good backup guns not accurate over 45 ft very good for close up good buy set includes 2 guns around 200 airsoft bbs and two pairs of goggles good beginers gun overall a very good buy
5,Clifford is One of my New Idols,"Clifford is such a well-spoken, sensible, open-minded scholar. Everybody should read his works and imitate his ethical belief policy. I am very pleased with this purchase, this seller, and the rapid time in which I received this book.IT IS WRONG ALWAYS, EVERYWHERE, AND FOR ANYONE, TO BELIEVE ANYTHING UPON INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE. ~Clifford"
2,What a piece of trash,"I honestly can't believe this movie was nominated for anything. It wasn't a bad movie, but it was so hammed up and goofy that I laughed at this movie more than anything. I live in Los Angeles and even though some of the characters hit close to home it's still too goofy and dumb to be taken seriously-you don't have to live here to see that. There were so many better movies that should have won best picture, but oh well."
2,Over rated,"The ONLY reason this movie was so big is because of all the controversy surrounding gay marriage. It's what's hip now. Which is also why Tom Hanks' character in the Da Vinci code was gay (which does not go in accordance with the book).Directing was great, and the scenery was beautiful. The acting was okay... Come on, a bunch of B team actors.A waste of money and time. Nothing wrong with the story, but... the movie just wasn't that great."
2,Predictable and Manipulative,"I found the characters to be one dimensional and predictable. I find it hard to take a movie down that really wants to say something and there are individual scenes (Matt Dillon survives this mess of a screenplay) with power. But, it was so manipulative and then at the end - with the pretty, annoying song, it manages to make sure all loose ends are tied up. It wanted to feel immediate and fresh, but it felt very dated. I blame the director (also the screenplay) for taking on more then he could change. He short changes a lot of these characters and takes the air out of his entire movie."
1,Should be a sonnet,"I suppose one can have a fetish for anything - shoes, wigs, glass eyes, even cars or car crashes. But tell me, how many times would one need to watch glass-eye fetishists engaging in smouldering sex before one appreciated the fetish itself? At best, one would be likely only to appreciate the sex. Sadly, this film didn't even do that - a single moment's worth of Sharon Stone crossing her legs was far more effective.It doesn't work either as a metaphor for our ""love affair"" with the automobile. One could perhaps build a sonnet around such an image, but ""Crash"" is a one-trick pony that gains nothing from endless swinging of the same sledgehammer to crack the same nut. Out of such material an epic cannot be made. I'd be genuinely interested to see what a more economical version (10 minutes maximum) could achieve. Possibly some genuine artistic merit."
1,Crash with Sandra Bullock,This DVD had the worst mix of voices from the actors and music background.If you lowered the music so as not to be offensive to your ears then you could not hear the actors speak.Very poorly done.Donot waste you money on this one.
1,Heavy handed,"From the first crash scene, you understand the message. It is delivered in a crude, unsubtle, and heavy-handed way.That message is then repeated--crudely, unsubtly--and heavy-handedly--over and over and again.The dialog is unbelievable, the story less so, the coincidences beyond the wildest imagination, and it just goes on and on, playing the one note, over and over. Heavy handedly.There are a few moments that ring true, rather like a broken clock is right twice a day. The acting (barring Matt Dillon) is excrable, and I thought if I heard Sandra Bullock and the woman who appears on early on (the one molested by Matt Dillon) get hysterical one more time, I was going to whack them both on the mouth.Did I say ""heavy handed""?To think this movie was even nominated for best picture is a travesty. Winning the BP Oscar is simply nuts--especially against such a good field.If I could give this zero stars, I would. Or less."
2,What?,"I rented this movie before it won best picture and turned it off after 30 minutes because I thought is was a ridiculously preachy public service announcement that was ripping off a few dozen movies already made. After it won best picture, I questioned my rush to judgement and rented it again. Much to my dismay, my initial reaction to the flick was not in error. I spent the majority of the time in this move shaking my head in disbelief at occurrences that would never happen. If you are a movie watcher who does not like to be insulted by ridiclous coincidences, this is not your movie. Trust me."
2,Unrealistic:,"I had to see the movie that beat Brokeback Mountain for best picture, I was a little worried that this would be a better film. Well, I was wrong, it isn't, I felt the movie lacked structure and consistency, while also painting a negative view of Los Angeles, and the human race. Yes, we do live in a world filled with hate and ignorance, but this movie does not teach us to be tolerant of others, it teaches us fear. While, I felt Brokeback,was about unconditonal love and people needing people."
2,B-grade film.,"CRASH - ""deep"" and ""thought-provoking"" for stupid people; melodramatic and two-dimensional for the rest of us who know better and who've seen better."
1,Trash!!!,"This movie, is simply trash and did not deserve the Oscar it got. Brokeback Mountain clearly DESERVED best picture, and every other nominee was an actual better picture than this. I saw this movie and it was a ""good"" movie, but was not the BEST PICTURE. Not Best Picture Material at all, it has a good message but the way its told, with the THOUSANDS of characters is confusing and makes no sense. Oh and why is it being released the same day as Brokeback Mountain DVD? Thats hilarious, no one will buy this DVD you realize, no one has even heard this movie existed until its nomination.. so good luck selling DVDs. Meanwhile the true Best Picture as its named by the hundreds of more credible awards like the Golden Globes, BAFTA's etc... will sell millions and Crash, will be forgotten. Three cheers for Trash! I mean Crash!"
2,Racism: A Crash Course,"After being nagged for months by friends who swore by this film, I gave in and borrowed ""Crash."" I still do not understand how people didn't find this movie extremely offensive, in that it decides to approach racism using pure stereotyped characters. (I don't care if the characters had two-dimensions, people are not one-dimensional or two-dimensional for that matter and this is something that American filmmakers especially tend to forget) To hear this film compared to American classics ranging from ""Nashville"" to ""Mystic River""...it just drives me nuts. Crash was a classic example of how a filmmaker can make a ""statement"" without ever really saying anything meaningful at all. Perhaps a better title would have been ""Tony Danza's Character Doesn't Like African Americans"" because that's about all I could take away from this film."
2,Contrived and heavy handed,"I can't believe this is up for best picture. The plot is so contrived and the dialogue so heavy handed--there are so many coincidences of characters running into each other at key moments in the story is just wasn't believable. And everyone always happens to be talking ideologically, mostly about race. People don't talk this way. From the first line I just felt like I was listening to a writer's thoughts...not experiencing a story. I know I am in the minority, but this one just didn't work for me. First rule in writing is to make the story ""do"" exactly what you, the writer, wants it to do, but make it look like you had nothing to do with it. I could see this story ""working"" from the first scene. Disappointed. Thought the Academy had more intelligence than this. Good performances wasted on shoddy writing."
3,Average Movie,"Until the moment which the movie start i thought i will see a good movie. but, i have been shocked with an average movie. i am sorry for those stars who casted in this movie. because some characters are not connected to the other. And from the beginning of the movie i thought it is an advertise for an insurance company."
2,Don't care too much for Crash,"A coworker brought this dvd to work and wanted all of us to take turns taking it home and watching it. When it was my turn, I watched it, but I was not impressed. Crash is made up of too many different stories and too many different characters. That makes it hard to follow and keep up with, even more so since so many of the characters look alike. I didn't even realize that it was some of the same people in more than one different story till I read some of the other reviews presented here. I also don't think it's very realistic. Fifty years ago, maybe, when racial prejudice was still a widespread problem, but racial issues are not that much of a problem today."
1,Were you tricked into liking this movie?,"Are you kidding me with this movie? I was getting extremely angry with every passing line of ridiculous dialogue. Was this movie trying to capture something real? Because it failed. Miserably. And if it wasn't, what was the point then? Someone please tell me. You have to be extremely cut off from all reality to watch this movie, and come away with some kind of truth. Leave this kind of film to Spike Lee. Because this movie is one long string of pedantic crap written by people who are completely ignorant of racism in America."
1,"They Give Academy Awards to Racist, Anti-White Propaganda Films Don't They?","Why did this film win an academy award for best picture? I guess it was because it was the only candidate more politically correct than Brokeback Mountain.If you hate White people, check it out."
1,At best a made for TV movie,Stereotypical 2-dimensional characters; unbelievable plot line; left me totally cold after I saw it. I forgot it 5 minutes after the movie was over and never even talked about it with friends. It did not touch me or move me at all like BrokeBack Mountain and Capote did. Can't believe it won best picture over the other 4 nominated movies. Walk the Line wasn't even nominated and Crash ended up on many critic's 10 worst movies list. What a joke. I think every unemployed actor and actress in Hollywood was in this movie and that's why it won. The American public and the Academy knows it made an embarrassing mistake naming this the best picture.
1,For rasist people,"This was basically a movie about a bunch of racist people being racist to each other and fulfilling sterotypes with their own behavior:The two black teenagers are - surprise! - juvenile delinquents up to no good. The succesful black married couple are portrayed as ""white"" blacks. The white police officer is racist and abusive. One black woman is a coke addict.The other races aren't given quite as much face-time, but their portrayal follows the same vein.If you want to wallow in and enjoy the racist attitudes of the 40's, see this movie. If you like to see different races fulfilling the stereotype of ""their kind"", see this movie. If you're KKK, you'll love it - your perceptions of people of other races will have been validated by this movie."
4,Crash !,"Movie was good.I thought it wasn't going to be.Crash reminds me of the movie Traffic.There's alot of things going on and they follow every characters life seperately.I thought for sure this movie was going to be terrible but it's worth watching and renting.I don't recommend buying it , it's not that great to own."
3,"Jeez, people, write a novel, why don't you?","THIS FIM IS NOT FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES.The content is too serious for casual viewing. Unless you want to ponder serious issues for fun. There's a lot of plot to keep track of in Crash, too. At times you think you know what will happen, that it might be a bit formulaic, but stick with it. In the end I thought it was well crafted and worthy of viewing."
3,Connectivity of people to each other,"Pretty good movie, helps you realize the connectivity of people to each other in real life situations, and how they can affect each other."
5,I HAD TO EXPLORE MY OWN PREJUDICES!!!,THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF OUR TIME! IT IS TRULY BREATH-TAKING. IT FORCED ME TO LOOK AT MYSELF AND MY OWN PREJUDICES. THE ALL-STAR CAST FEATURED HERE GIVE PERFORMANCES OF A LIFETIME. NO DVD LIBRARY IS COMPLETE WITHOUT THIS MOVIE!!!
2,Crash,"Just not the movie for me. Started watching this for about 10 minutes and could not get interested and shut it off.Thought it was very boring, and Corney. The actors were not the best.Not saying anything bad about the movie really, someone else might like it, but for my taste, it just wasn't for me."
1,"""Crash"" Lands With a Thud","White, liberal guilt at its worse. Wanna see a more realistic movie about Los Angeles and laugh while you're doing? Check out the comedy ""L.A. Proper"" on Amazon Video on Demand.L.A. Properis a comedy about a multi-ethnic group of friends looking for love, sex, work and happiness during the long days and short nights of Los Angeles."
4,Thought provoking and moving if a tad stiltied,"I found this movie to be intelligent, gripping and stirring. It is a real collaborative effort, with lots of big name actors taking smaller parts than they might normally and doing a hell of a job performing. The only thing that keeps this from getting five stars is the script: It's a little bit overwritten, as ""issues"" movies often are. The dialogue occasionally reflects more what the screenwriter is saying than what it seems plausible for the character to be saying. Still, it's a very honest, ambiguous, thought-provoking film, one worth seeing more than once and with different friends to hear their thoughts about it. Racial issues have seldom been examined so directly and from so many sides. This makes it an excellent family movie as well, although (another weakness in my mind) the ""f"" word is WAY overused!!"
2,overrated,"A highly touted, well-reviewed film that I was looking forward to seeing. Unfortunately, as is so often the case with this type of movie, the results were disappointing. Contrived, trite, and without any depth. Pretty forgettable."
3,Stereotypes Gone Wild,"About sums it up. Blacks are poor tippers and thieves. Whites are afraid blacks will rob them (fear fulfilled). White men take advantage of black women. Someone who saves your life in the morning may kill you in the evening (or vice versa). Persians (since Persia no longer exists, perhaps they were Iranians?) don't bother to listen or pay attention, just talk over you, become insanely angry, and try to murder you. Hispanics come out looking good. Asians are money-hungry and will sell out their own race. Also mothers and fathers never appreciate the ""good"" children. Someone else gets credit for the thoughtful deeds performed for the unappreciative parent.This is some very broad pigeon-holing but doesn't really go anywhere. Entertaining to watch, although a bit slow at times, well-acted, but not a masterpiece or anything."
2,Slow and wondering,"The movie is slow and wondering until the last 25 minutes where it is all brought together. Unfortunately, it is so fragmented that there is little character development."
4,Pretty good movie,"Not bad. don't think i would watch it again, but it did pass the time for a little while. have seen better Sandra Bullock movies."
3,"Trite, but entertaining","While I was watching, I couldn't get it out of my head that this appears to be a scene-by-scene remake of Robert Altman's ""Shortcuts."" Using shock-value racial situations comes across as a cheap gimmick, rather than good filmmaking. Good for a rainy day video rental. I would not recommend racing out to see it."
1,There was a good idea in there somewhere.,"However the script is such an amateurish mess that the film fails miserably. The performances are wonderful, especially for such a parade of B-listers but with that screenplay it is all for not.There is never a moment of truth in this entire film. It disappoints me so much I had to give it one star. It could have been so great and so important if a competent filmmaker had been involved."
1,No truth whatsoever,"This movie tries to come off as if it knows what racism in LA is like. In reality, this movie shows how little the filmmakers really know. I don't deny that racism in LA exists; it still exists every where in some degree. But racism in LA is a *lot* more subtle then this movie would make the average viewer think.Steve Lopez at the LA Times said it best in his recent column (http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-lopez8mar08,1,4678341.column)."
2,I tried to like this movie,"It was recommended to me and I don't like to question the taste or intelligence of friends, but I honestly could not finish it. I saw characters doing things that rang so false that I wondered what the heck Haggis was thinking. Then I remembered his Million Dollar Baby work and it made more sense. He doesn't go for reality - he goes for the message, and twists reality in service of that. It was especially ironic that the carjacker was played by a rapper named ""ludacris"". It's an apt description for much of the behavior in this contrived setup. As far as Best Picture Oscars go, Crash might even be a poorer choice than American Beauty."
2,A hackneyed ABC After School Special,"I wanted to like this movie. I really did. I had heard good things about it from friends, but in the end, I realized I'd seen every plot line and technique in the movie done before and done much better. ""Short Cuts"" meets ""Do the Right Thing"" meets ""House of Sand and Fog"" meets ""Magnolia"".Far from being touched, I was completely irritated that a couple of white guys (Haggis and Moresco) were preaching to me about racism with all the authenticity and subtlety of a hammer (apparently the one referred to in Haggis's acceptance speech).I for one don't appreciate a director insulting my intelligence with hackneyed cliches, laughable stereotypes and morality tales with all the moral complexity of an ABC After School Special."
1,Trivializes and Justifies Racism,"This self aggrandizing work may placate liberal white guilt that ""there just like us"" but its a poor piece of film making and purveys vicious stereotypes in its own insipid way."
2,TRASH,"What up B? U rook redicurous! My cheby is the chit, holmes! Too much stereotyping for me, got old quick! Very disappointing! The dramatic scenes were really corny too!"
2,THRILL! MELODRAMA! INTRIGUE! HOLLYWOOD!,"Don't get me wrong this isn't a necessarily a terrible movie, but I was rather disappointed how this film coped out from actually dealing with some of the prevalent racial issues within society. The characters were too flat an unbelievable, the situations too fantastic to seem plausible, and that god-awful music seemed to dictate when I should experience moments of intense emotion. The treatment of this complex societal problem was too general and contrived. What is left over in the viewer is merely scenes of suspense and wonder, a Hollywood film a little too pretentious to be a true commentary."
2,The original is better...,I liked the original better. David Cronenberg's Crash was far superior to this. Paul Haggis ended up ditching the original storyline and made this film about race relations! WTF??? I was so disappointed...
1,"Not that great .... Dark, Gloomy, Depressive and Joyless,","Be warned: this is a rather dark, gloomy, joyless and almost depressive look at race relations in America or to be accurate mainly LA. It takes a pretentious all knowing perspective but in actual fact has a rather limited view of human nature. The main point this film tries to make is an old one, namely that everybody, white, black or brown harbors and operates with their own set of racial or ethnic prejudices. The film however overstates its case to the limit so that almost no single character in the film except a 5 year old girl comes out unscathed. In its dark treatment of LA street crime and the police force it is mainly derivative, bringing to mind countless other better films: LA Confidential, Training Day, Collateral .. to name a few."
1,Absolutely TERRIBLE,"Beauty Shop is a deep exploration of race relations compared to this over-the-top garbage.If it were a made for TV movie, I could forgive the bad writing and direction. However, as a feature film it is a pretentious, simple-minded, fresh out of film school mess."
1,Insulting,"I saw this movie back in '91 when it was called Grand Canyon. It made me nauseous then, too.Before I knew it was Haggis I would have bet the writers were two recent Emerson grads. But Haggis is Canadian so I was not far off.Pretentious, predictable, unwatchable. The all-star cast could have been scrapped and replaced with racial stereotypes written in gigantic, flashing neon letters that drifted lazily across the screen.To boot, they ripped off the tricky editing technique from ""21 Grams"" of match action cuts from vignette to vignette.The most damning comment is that only a white person would find the movie powerful. Everyone else - insulting."
1,The Academy should be ashamed of itself !,"Crash is trash! The Academy should be ashamed of itself for awarding such garbage, I wish I could give it 0 star!!!"
2,Predictable and contrived.,"The movie is overrated and it tries to hard to be touching. It plays on the theme that there is good and bad in everyone, and everyone is tied to one another by subplots. The stupid part is in LA the characters have extreme personalities and stereotypes. Yes I know they are trying to talk about racism and be heart warming, but it comes across as very contrived.Example of a dumb scene and epitimizes this movie is the part where the grocery guy uses the gun."
1,Simple Minded Junk,"I just finished watching this film. I find that it takes a very simplistic and childlike view of race relations. It's extremely melodramatic in all of the wrong ways. It started out as intriguing with the development of plot, but the resolutions were weak and tepid. This has a very TV-movie quality to it, and I am SHOCKED that this movie won the best movie of the year. The only thing I can think of is that the liberal Hollywood elite wants Americans to think that there is still a tremendous amount of civil strive between races. This hostility is what fuels the Dem base. There is of course still racism in this country, but there is no way it is this ubiquitous, and this movie constantly veers towards parody unintentionally with its heavy handed ""everyone's a little bit racist"" cries."
1,Overrated,"Crash is an overrated and amateurish film about race relations in LA. It is contrived and obvious in its storytelling. If you want a great film about prejudice & race watch ""In the Heat of the Night"". Crash is no better than an average tv movie on Lifetime."
4,This is not a summary,"I'm not going to write a summary of this movie, but drop some comments about how I felt.Crash is a movie whose tagline describes the movie perfectly. ""You think you know who you are. You have no idea."" Unless you know where someone is coming from, you can never truly know them. If you don't know other people, you can't really know yourself. I think this movie is trying to teach us this lesson. What factos actually defines who a person is, anyway?I took off half star for overusing racial slurs. I beleive most racism these days is more covert and implicit. I thought it detracted from the realism a bit.Great soundtrack and cameras. I think this is a great movie if you want something that will force you to question yourself and the world you live in."
2,Is Freedomland going to win next year?,"I saw this film when it first came out and was not impressed. I was shocked when it was nominated for ""best picture,"" although perhaps it was a sad reflection on the competition.The film is an extremely unrealistic examination of race relations in LA. The dialogue is, at times, so far out that the film is unintentionally funny. Only the most brain-washed, gullible of viewers will be able to stomach this one.I suspect that the positive reviews you see here at Amazon come from those at the Academy who voted for ""Crash"" and are trying to justify their bizarre action, as well as from the film-makers friends and relatives."
3,"Racism, Bad (Gee)","Talk about heavy-handed!The writers throw in almost every racial stereotype (except the one about model minorities), but fail to really bring out the depth of any.Too simplistic -- Underestimates the intelligence of the audience.LA is a big place. Too big for so many coincidences.Could have done without the cheesy introduction.Makes me not want to drive.Sandra Bullock never looked better.Thandie Newton, you're gorgeous, but you really need to eat something!Don Cheadle only makes me think of Mad TV."
2,Crash? - More like Bump,"I don't think there is anything revolutionary about the social theme in Crash. RACISM IS BAD - how was that a news flash in 2005? Doesn't everybody but the KKK and neo-Nazis already get it? I'm not saying that racism is dead, it clearly is NOT, but I don't think it can stand as a jaw-dropping film theme anymore. We have all been taught the lessons.I want to make it clear that my comments are not intended to minimize the importance of the continuing battle agaist racism - it's VERY important. I just don't think that Crash presents us with anything new.I found the film to be very heavy handed, pedantic and predictable, and there was nothing bold about it. I wouldn't consider it a great artistic achievement - let alone deserving of a Best Picture Oscar."
1,Driver! Slow down! There's life out there!,This is what L.A. looks like through the tinted windows of a chauffer driven Lexus hybrid on its way in and out of a gated studio. Although I think Hollywood's new tradition of nominating and handing out Oscars to the campiest films of the year is a breakthrough....
3,THIS MOVIE IS GOOD AND IT HAS A GREAT CAST!!!!!!,"Crash is a great movie,but the only thing that i didn't enjoy about this movie was that it was too racial!!!!!! In the world that we live in we go through this everyday so we don't need a movie to tell us!!!!!! The movie was good it has a great cast which includes Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillion, and Thandie Newton!!!!!!! I like that it was filmed in LA and it has a beautiful haunting score to go with it!!!!!!"
1,IT MIGHT WORK AS A COMEDY,"The writing is BAD BAD BAD.I knew I should have turned this movie off when a woman called her son and he answered the phone and said, ""I can't talk now, Mom. I'm ******* a white woman."" Turns out the woman is hispanic and they fight for 10 minutes.If this sounds ridiculous to you, it only gets worse. Every storyline in this film is outrageously bad and conveys all of the racist stereotypes the film allegedly fights against.One heavy-handed, poorly written scenario after another.The cast screams and yells and hates for two unbearable hours and then it snows.So what?Watch 'Do The Right Thing' instead, a far less flawed exploration of race relations."
3,Good but not in any way OSCAR WORTHY!,"It was a very good film but how it beat Brokeback Mountain and even Good Night, and Good Luck is beyond me! Not Best Picture material but is over all entertaining and enjoyable."
3,Great product!,"This recoil pad is a great product, BUTsome improvements are NEEDED!Instructions are limited. If you are already anexperienced gunsmith, no problem, But if your not,,,,The sizeing is very poorly described, make sure you get the right size.The shaping was easy on a bench mounted disc sander, BUT, they didn't mention that the ends need to be angled to match the angle of the butt stock. Easily done by tilting the table of your sander.Also us a VERY SHARP razor knife to cut the slits for the mounting screws, or the holes will show.Over all, I am very pleased with the recoil pad, but will probably order another oneand redo the job so it looks better."
2,Wireless Remote Control Tanks,Wireless Remote Control Tanks. Not a very good product; can only manuever on hard surfaces. My child lost interest quickly because of this; it kept getting stuck once we took it on the grass.
3,"At the end, one question remains","(Paraphrased) Leed: ""Father, if I return to Rutin, it will break my heart. I don't know it, I don't love it like I love Senali. You sent me there, I found a family there, I love it. But that doesn't have to mean I'll stay away from my blood family or Rutan. Senali is close-..."" ""It's close, but who wants to go there?"" King Frane replied angrily. (end paraphrase)If first-borns had been exchanged for generations. And if King Frane, like he said, had been his mother's chosen one, like she was his Grandfather's chosen one, should he not know? Throughout the book, I never understood the lack of knowledge and understanding of Frane (or even Meenon's for that matter), that sparked the blind conflicts between the worlds or the prejudices between its people, if future kings lived among them during their growing years.As a story I found it quite entertaining, but as a departing point, I found it nowhere as intriguing as the first three books, or the seventh."
5,I love this KJ bible.,"This wonderful King James bible has the old biblical translation language I loved as a child, has all the Old and New Testaments, and has the ""Apocrypha"" which, of course, were never taught or even acknowledged when I grew up with it. I've spent hours with this bible ... when I read in ""Apocrypha"" the story of Daniel, the first recorded lawyer, I was delighted and hooked. Thank you with all my heart, Amazon, for making this so available and so affordable. You made my Christmas."
3,The Bible: Authorized King James Version with Apocrypha,"This is the version used by Catholics and is missing Psalm 151, 3 and 4 Maccabees. It does not contain the entire Apocrypha!"
2,Not a user friendly bible.,"I wish I never bought this edition. Why? It's much thicker than any standard bible (almost an inch more) and heavier too. You'll develop muscles reading it, or you just won't pick it up. Get a second hand KJV - probably same price, slimmer and lighter, nicer binding, and the text is exactly the same anyway."
1,Doesn't Work For A Sew-In,"I had a sew-in, which means my actual hair underneath was braided up. I bought this product to use on my scalp to relieve some of the itching for the braided hair. Not only did it NOT stop the itching, it made it worse. Now I don't know if I just have some bad reaction to something in the mix or not, but it didn't stop my itching.I know that I had an odd reaction to Tea Tree Oil, as I tried some hair grease with TTO in it while I had my tracks in, and I had the same reaction. The other factor that should be considered to is that my scalp wasn't exposed to open air; I used this products between loose areas in my sew in to try and get to my scalp. So maybe that has some play in the burning sensation on my head."
5,A must have!,"If you have braids, this product really helps with the itching. The smell is very pleasant also! This is a must have!"
2,Not what I hoped for!,"After using a Braun 255 for almost a decade without a problem, I made the assumption that Braun shavers were superior. I was wrong! The 5416 does not shave close. My old 255 still works fantastic and much better than this newer Braun. The Flex head is a gimmick to compete with the Norelco Floating head,,, but it's just a gimmick. I'm pretty sure that the 255 was made by German craftsmen,,, and that Gillete (the current owner), now makes them in Mexico. It may work for you if you have no qualms about taking 20 minutes to shave. My 255 did it in 3 minutes. It's just good enough not to be sent back. But I'm going to think long and hard before buying another Braun. I'm tempted to continue using the 255 on an electric cord."
1,Razor or toy?,"Slow and feeble, this razor requires multiple (in fact, many multiple) passes over my (average) beard to produce a passable shave. I thought I was moving up when my Remington of 15 years faded, but what I got was all form - a sleek. not very comfortable design - with minimal function. Bottom line, it really doesn't do the job even when fully charged or plugged in. I notice that Braun has items in a huge price range. What are these lower end shavers for? I'd return this one if I could find the box."
1,They Don't Make'em Like They Used to!,"If you want to spend 15-20 minutes shaving each morning, then this razor is for you. Especially if you're not looking for a nice smooth shave. The two-bladed design just does't move with the contours the way the bigger single blade does. This new razor was given to me for Christmas -- a replacement for my damaged Braun #5567, a cordless that I've used since 1995. My old razor, a single-bladed braun, cut much closer and smoother. And it took less time. Well, Ive taken out my old, taped-together Braun and will use it until Braun starts ""making'em like they used to!"""
1,Very disappointed,"I have received product different from my ordered it. I got it the day before yesterday, opened yesterday. Without doubtly I use 4-inch knife. But it's not good. so I compared My product with picture in homepage. Oh!my god! It's different. 7inch knife in homepage picture is written ~germany. But my knife is just Germany.There is a number beside square. but my knife isn't any number. Also,there is no MADE IN GERMANY in box. I think It's may be MADE IN CHINA. I want a refund!!!"
3,Could have been better,"After writing a masterpiece in Essential System Administration (a book for UNIX sysadmins), I felt that this NT version of her book fell short. The book provides plenty of useful screenshots, but overall the amount of information is minute. I expect the second edition to be much better."
5,"Awesome Workbook, USE FOR SCORE INCREASE","So, a friend of mine recommended this workbook to me. He said that it helped him increase by 70 pts from a 670 to a 740. I bought it, did most of the sentence completions, studied the vocab., and did the passages. I went from a 670 on the critical reading (March sat 09') to a 750! (Dec sat 09'). I have to say that I am thoroughly impresseed with this book. It arranges the sentence completions in three sets according to difficulty and the passage based reading questions are harder than the real sat which definitely prepared me. Highly recommended."
4,Barron's provides excellent preparation materials,"I teach SAT prep/review classes independently, and have been using the Barron's workbook for several years. The material is challenging, and provides students with a large number of high-frequency SAT words used in context. The vocabulary lists, root origins of words, and practice tests are all excellent.Kate Connors,Holliston MA"
1,This is the worst tripe I've heard in a long time,"I've never heard of any of the bands on this CD and I'm not upset about that either. These so called musicians have taken beautiful, thought provoking songs from a calibre of talent like Tori Amos and totally ruined them. This CD is a total waste of money unless you're the kind of person who likes to get wasted and listen to trash. In that case, turn the radio to in-between stations and listen to white noise, there's more musical talent there. My advice to anyone thinking of getting into Tori's music is this: listen to the originals only and bypass this mess altogether. You'll be better off for it because this CD is an insult."
2,not at all what i expected,"Okay...I was so disappointed. I was all excited to hear iiee by Meegs and Jessicka b/c Coal Chamber and Jack Off Jill are two of my favorite bands but I didn't like what they did with the song. I would have to say that there are a few songs that I can listen to (Cornflake Girl, Winter, Crucify, God; Caught a lite sneeze made me laugh). I love Tori, and I love the idea that people want to do covers of her songs and I understand that when you do a cover you should make it your own, and it shouldn't sound exactly like the original but come on. I'm sure that if I wasn't a fan of Tori,and maybe had never heard the originals that these songs could be great. Or if I bought the cd of any of the bands that are on the tribute maybe I'd like some of their own stuff. I would buy the CD with caution...it was quite something to listen to for the first time."
1,For the hard core collector ONLY,"...This tribute record is simply awful. When Tori does remakes she takes the song apart and then reassembles it in Tori fashion. That is her art, as well as her original songs. I bought this record thinking it would be fun. I had never heard of any of the other artists. I know lots of people love Tori, but the people involved with this compilation just did remakes of the songs without making the songs their own. Plus, the other problem is that Tori has such a unique sound that it doesn't really lend it's self to remakes. I think that if this record would have been put in more capable hands it could have been pulled off. But, instead, we get a bunch of Tori-wanna-be's doing Tori. And not really doing Tori very well at all..."
4,Good stuff,"So far ok have not washed them yet, time will tell. They are not microfiber but very soft for final touch, shine shows...."
5,Good product,"There isn't much to be said about a terminal block. This one is good quality, and I can't see any reason not to buy it if you're in the market for one."
2,"A few gems, but mostly uninspired techno remixes","This album serves as a reminder of the importance of arrangement, and specifically, of Susan Wallace.I might be coming from a slightly biased perspective. I really enjoy Switchblade Symphony, so I might be somewhat less receptive. Also, I am not generally fond of dance/electronica. I'm sorry, but the same 4/4 drum pattern and two-measure synth loop gets old after five minutes.There are a few songs which I can stand on this album (Rampid and Clown), but my affection ends there. The rest seem horribly disjointed; we're not talking about a little forgivable mixplay, but rather an attrocity. Most of these songs sound like some raverboy added Tina's vocals to whatever bouncy-... electronica happened to be in his Casio's memory at the time. Not everything needs or warrents a full-blast drum machine assault, and not everything can be a dance song (at least not without some serious work).Granted it's hard as ... to match Susan's style, but this is a shame."
3,"What, no HD?","There did not seem to be an HD version of this season available. The show is great, but the quality on Amazon left a lot to be desired. Kinda put me off of ever buying another series through them."
5,SIMPLY AMAZING....,"This stuff just simply doesnt let up - loud,never-ending-screaming vocals,loud drums,loud EVERYTHING yet their is a method to this madness,this unholy racket - real songs are here,great songs in fact! One could quite easily dismiss this as incoherent noise,yet dig just a tiny bit deeper and discover a TIMELESS MASTERPIECE years before its time."
4,Yummi Sandwiches,"This device makes delicious hot sandwiches (depending on what you put in it). It is inexpensive and does a terrific job. However, the cleaning could be made a little bit easier by closing the gaps between the plastic shell and the heating panels. Just be careful to not overfill it and make the cheese run all over. But for the rest, a great 4 star item, thanks!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I got my first Braun in 1989. It lasted until 2002 or 2003.Then I got this and I cussed at this shaver every dang day. It is sooo poor at cutting that I just gave up and bought blades for the past 2 years. If you want to take the weekend off, come Monday morning you'll be sorry. Put you money towards something better. I'm really disappointed in Braun on this one. I'm thinking Panasonic."
2,Not up to Brauns Standards,"After using this shaver a year it became time to replace the screen and blade. Since the replacement would have cost [$] and I only paid [more money] for the shaver, I decided to trash it. I was never really happy with it anyway. It seemed to be low on motor power and had a tough time on a thick beard. This was unlike most of the other Brauns that I had owned. I am afraid they had cheapened this low end model to the point it was made in China. I decided to replace it with aBraun 5414. A nice German made shaver with a pivoting head. This shaver was much better than the Inferface and had much better quality as well. Unlike the one I am reviewing now, it is able to get at those close growing neck hairs."
1,The Worst Shaver I've Ever Used!!!,"I think the fellow that said this shaver is ""a piece of junk"" was way too kind. The Braun 3612 requires you to go over and over and over the same area in order to get, at best, a still stubbly shave. I've owned at least 5 older Braun models (all excellent!) but this one is a joke! I even replaced the foil and cutter block after about 5 uses and it's no better. The 3612 razor is a waste of MONEY and your time... unless you have 20 minutes to kill irritating your face with this ""shaver"" each morning."
3,"Good Razor, Good Luck With Replacing Blades","Works reliably and well at first, but quickly needs replacement foil and blades. You can find them online but they cost almost as much as a complete new razor. What's the point of buying a $29 electric razor when the replacement blades cost $25, that is IF you can find them. I'm trying the cheap $10 razors from my local drugstore... even if they fail 2 and a half times as quickly, I'm still no worse off."
5,Braun 3612 Interface Rechargeable Shaver,"Excellent product. This is the second unit that I have purchased - the first one lasted about 8 years and I replaced the foil/cutter twice during that time. The rechargeable battery finally would not charge to full potential and a new foil/cutter was needed, so I purchased another unit thru Amazon for not much more than the cost of the foil/cutter at Walgreens! I would highly recommend this shaver for anyone who wants a rechargeable men's foil type shaver."
3,"Decent, but you should get better","This was the first electric razor I ever owned. I bought it in 2002 and used it till 2009. I guess it was pretty good for the price, but it never gave a really close shave. It was always kind of ""good enough"". My in-laws got me a Remmington R4130NB for Christmas so I'd have something better and my wife threw this one out without asking me. The Remmington was a complete piece of garbage making me miss this mediocre shaver. I just finished buying the Braun 340 and I'm thrilled with it. I'd definitely recommend that as an alternative as it's worth the few extra bucks it'll cost you."
1,Product is misrepresented,"This product label specifically states that the 1000 sample problems thet are both seismic and surveying. They are all surveying and no seismic. Also some of the surveying problems are poorly written and riddled with mistakes. Example: I select A as the answer and it states that my answer is wrong and C is the correct answer but their answer matches A not C. Don't believe the five star ratings. Click on see all my reviews for the five star ratings which are obviously a scam. Boy these folks take a lot of professional exams ranging from Civil Engineering to other exams that have nothing to do with engineering at all. Wait a minute, What is this? A different title and Author! These reviews were written for California Seismic and Surveying Principles Simulation Software 1000 questions! How did they get posted for Principles and Practice of Land Surveying Sample Examination which isn't available yet? This isn't fair to Mr. Cole!"
1,"A work of fiction, poorly written","I agree with the reviewer who said this book is a fiction. IT ABSOLUTELY IS. I personally know several Amish families. Hex signs are simply meant to be pretty and simple. They are no more magick or symbolic than if I drew a heart on a piece of paper. . .ooooh look, it's a love spell! Really, now! Don't waste your money. www.amishnews.com has a great little article on the real history of the hex sign."
2,You do not get what you do not pay for...,"The drive works fine and is inexpensive, but the cap is cheap plastic. This the cap has, or I should say had, flanges (also cheap plastic) that easily broke off and now the cap won't stay on. I have scotch taped it on until I decide on which one to buy next. No need to buy a vowel here, it won't be an A-Data."
5,A LEGEND!,"Having grown up in the 60's, and being a Fashion Major as well as a big fan of Jackie Kennedy I was excited to read this book, and pleasantly surprised with Mulvaney's perspective on Mrs. Kennedy's wardrobe. I own many books on Jackie Kennedy and was particularly impressed with the photos and information presented in this book on this fashion icon. I read this book from cover to cover in one day. The photos are stunning, and images of Mrs. Kennedy through her husband's White House years as well as post years are presented in black and white along with color. If you are a Jackie Kennedy admirer, or a Fashion History buff; this is a phenomenal book to add to your collection...well worth the hardback price anywhere!"
5,"Witty, Clever and Informative","That's what US magazine said about this book and I agree. I saw it on Entertainment Tonight last week and it looked like a lively, fun, INTERESTING book about Jackie and her clothes, and it is. Affectionate without being reverential, with scads of great photos...It's THE book to buy about Jackie O's clothes..."
2,Not worthy,"I reckon this book doesn't worthy the money if you already have ""A Thousand Days of Magic: Dressing Jackie Kennedy for the White House"" by Oleg Cassini, or if you don't have ""A Thousand Days of Magic"", I strongly recommend it instead of this one. 90% of the pictures and sketches of Jackie's clothes are also included in ""A thousand Days of Magic"", which provides a much larger collection of her wardrobes/pictures and more detailed illustration of the design and her style. The outline and paper quality of ""A Thousand Days of Magic"" are also much better than this one, which is poorly presented by surrounding the pictures with lots of words. I very much regret that I bought this book :("
3,Not bad,It's alright. Good advice but it's hard to do the quizzes on the kindle version. It was easy to read and informative. However I was reading it for class so it's alright
1,muddled and unsatisfactory,"Nick is clearly an extremely talented code writer, but this in itself does not equip him well to teach others. He seems impatient with his readers, and this one is left feeling very confused. Many of the examples lack cross browser compatability; one even includes a visual basic script which seems laughable, given the title of the book. The text accompanying the examples is irritating because it is often not clear which words are javascript syntax and which are not. Bizarre formatting of the code on the bundled CDrom does not make for an easy ride, either."
5,A really good JavaScript / DHTML book,"Nick shows you how to do this and that, step by step. See, he loves javascript, and it shows in his examples. Forget what the other people say, this book is worth the price :)"
1,wheres swollen?,"i bought this cd just cause i thought swollen members were on it, and was disappointed cause they weren't, and masta ace sucks, while swollen members kick ass!!"
4,Meet the Raisins,"This is another classic from Claymation. Appropriate for those who enjoy good Claymation animation. Very funny little skits of the California Raisins as they rise to fame and fortune, and even includes some funny ""commercials"". This tape has great old '60's music to accompany the animation. If you enjoy the Raisins doing Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer in the classic a Claymation Christmas, then you'll probably enjoy this tape."
3,Watch Out For Faulty Nozzle,I have worn this fragrance for many years. I love the product but it arrived with the nozzle off. The nozzle part of the bottle was in the bottom of the box. When I tried to re-install the nozzle it would not stay on the bottle. When I can get the nozzle to stay on the bottle It will spray in a straight stream instead of a spray. It took a very long time to receive my order so I did not wish to return it. I do however caution you about this dilemma.
2,These heads should last longer,I've had this Braun shaver for the past 4 years. The first set of heads that came with the shaver lasted 3 and this set has lasted just one and is now worn out again. These things bite you when they wear out.
5,Great substitute for Activator 8595 shavers!!!,"I was looking for cutter and foil replacement for my Activator 8595 and could not find the original one any more. Braun has replaced that with a foil & cutter from series 5 shavers and as you read the reviews the shape of the cutter is different from the original series 8 cutters. Somebody suggested to use series 7000 foil and cutter instead, which is this item. The cutter is exactly looking the same as the original 8595 cutter but the foil BODY is colored BLACK (for 7000 series) instead of SILVER (for 8000 series) which was not an issue for me.Now my 8595 shaver is back to its original performance and I'm really happy with my purchase.Thanks to all who put useful reviews on Amazon."
5,Shaver Tune-up,"Braun shavers never seem to wear out, but after a couple years they don't give that super-close comfortable shave they did when new. A set of these will restore them to factory-fresh condition."
4,Not quite a fit for older Braun,"After not being able to find the earlier version of the cutter and foil for my old Braun model I decided to go with the 7000If you hold the old vs new cutters together and compare them there is a slight difference in the size of the foil. I bought this several months ago so I am sorry I can't tell you exactly what the difference is.What I can tell you is is that the new foil cuts much closer. So much so that I swapped them a few times to be sure, maybe it was the older one was worn but still I noticed it right away and hadn't before when replacing older foils.The other difference was that I was unable to get the new foil to work with the cleaning system until I moved it around in the cleaner a bit. Also, when I removed the razor from the cleaner it had taken some of the finish off of the razor up by the foil. Not that I care about that or that the foil is a different color, its the results that count and I will continue to use the 7000's"
1,Somebody changed something -- this does not fit my 7505,"I don't know who to blame: Amazon or Braun. The foil piece does not fit my Braun 7505 electric shaver. Earlier models of the replacement package must have fit the 7505 based on the earlier happy customers, but not now.Addendum:I called Braun customer service (1-800-272-8611). They were very helpful and offered to send me a replacement combo. I was afraid I'd get the same exact combo, but today it arrived via FedEx and both parts snapped in perfectly. Hopefully Amazon will read these reviews and switch to the correct part number (which, by the way, is Braun P/N 5491356)."
1,Doesn't fit 7526 either,"Back of the packaging: ""Fits all 7000 series shavers""Frustratingly, not the case at all. Does not fit the 7526."
3,"ok, but","Arguably the best foil model(my preference) electric since Sunbeam. However, I use it before a cartidge type blade razor to cut against the grain, since my blade razor is too painful against the grain. The combination leaves my face smooth and refreshed. Synchro alone is moderately OK especially since I don't go dancing cheek to cheek anymore."
3,"seen it, done it","It is really good for the cheap price. But the door or panel is very flimzy, just push it back in. Very good to have while travelling."
2,"Problems, problems","This razor has been pretty crappy to me. I got it as a Christmas gift about 1 1/2 years ago. After about 1 year, the foil got a tear in it, so I paid $26 and got the replacement pack (turns out Braun doesn't sell just the foil anymore). About 6 months after I bought the replcement, the foil got another tear in it. Now it nicks me every time I use it. It does a nice job, but it is crap for $30, spend a little extra and get a better razor."
1,A Waste for a Beginner,"I am a beginning rider, learning dressage. I thought from the title that this book would be a good introduction. The other comments are on the mark -- this book does virtually nothing to help the reader understand dressage. I do not recommend it and plan to throw away my copy (and I am a book hoarder by nature!)"
4,Not scratch proof,"I enjoy using my skillet, but from the description (""virtually indestructible""), I was under the assumption that the diamond surface was scratch proof. Not so. I make every effort to protect the surface, using only wooden, plastic, or heat-resistant rubber utensils--plus I wash it by hand; but it still managed to get several scratches."
5,BRAUN DESIGN!,"Listen, if you need a new Foil/Cutterblock, you will know that already. If you don't want to throw away your razor, buy this set! If you don't want the fabulous Braun design, buy a new razor..."
2,Does not fit all Braun Flex Shavers,"The cutter head works in the 7000 series shavers but the foil head does not fit. Is it worth the 5.00 savings to re-use the foil head. My guess is no, the manufacurer probably provides both for a reason."
4,Serves the purpose,I was surprised how much of a difference it made to replace these parts as Braun recommended. My shave is better.
5,Just Like New,"Makes your old razor work like new. I've had this shaver for well over ten years, I just replace the parts, and keep using it."
3,"Second Graders at The Potomac School in McLean, VA","Our young reviewers liked this clever tale of a line that changes shape to save Mother Goose characters from ruin, but think it best for a younger audience. They advise parents to share nursery rhymes with their kindergarteners and first graders before reading this silly bedtime story. Second graders predict the younger listeners will find the hero line helpful and hardworking, and will enjoy the resourceful rescues made for Little Boy Blue, Jack and Jill and Mary, Mary. Our seven- and eight -year-olds thought the simply-drawn illustrations worked well with the simple rhymes and would appeal to sleepy youngsters, as would the page borders creating a book within a book. In order to draw an older audience, the author is encouraged to add more sticky situations featuring Humpty Dumpty, Mary and Her Little Lamb or the Cow Jumping Over the Moon in any planned sequels."
2,5 minutes of info. in a 90 minute tape,This tape contains only one trading idea that could be layed out in a 5 minute conversation. It is a valid stategy but it has been presented in dozens of other books and videos.Also the production quality is very poor. It was taped at a live presentation and when people ask questions you can barely hear what they ask unless you turn the volume to max. and then back down when he answers.
3,"Great results, poor reliability","I have had two of these machines. The first one broke (irrigator stopped working although motor was running fine) and was fixed under warranty. After about a year it broke again, and since the cost to fix was close to the purchase price I bought a new one. Second one lasted about 2 years, then irrigator broke again. While using this machine I always received good reviews from my periodontist evey 3-4 months when I had my teeth cleaned (I always irrigated with mixture of water and listerine). When my last one quit in February, I did not replace it. My last two visits to the periodontist show my gums are not doing as well. So despite the poor reliablity experience I have had, I am getting another one. To comment on the lack of pressure, I don't look at this as a replacement for flossing, only as a way to reduce gum problems. I have always used a Waterpik in conjuntion with the Oxy Jet, and the Waterpik of course is great for getting food out from between the teeth."
5,Excellent product + superb service,This product was a great value and the service was perfect. We received the item within a few days with no special shipping.
3,Good monitor on a terrible stand,"The monitor is very good and I have no problems with it but the stand is just BAD. This is a case of false advertising. Samsung specifications and Amazon's own description indicate that the stand tilts but it does not. The stand is very static you can only swivle rigth and left but cannot tilt or adjust the height. This could be very aggravating, so if you are used to tilting your screens DO NOT BUY THIS ONE."
2,"Fool me once, shame on you, Samsung. There won't be a second time.","I own the Samsung 226BW monitor and just after the 3 years point and the end of the warranty it began flickering when I turned it on in the morning. At first just a few flickers but now it goes on for at least 15 minutes before I can use it again. I understand this is a capacitor issue but I don't have the skill to fix it so I will be shopping for another monitor. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 is that I have liked the monitor otherwise (contrast, color, sharpness, etc.) but this is just not acceptable performance over the long term. This is not the type of product that you expect to be a disposible item after just 3 years. Samsung seems to disagree given that this appears to be a known issue."
4,SAMSUNG 226BW,"It's a really good monitor! ^^I was really scared it would bleed since I saw some complains about that, but it doesn't!The fact that it can rotate is really good! ^^ It makes viewing a lot easier!The only sucky part about it is it doesn't tilt. So if I happen to be standing, there's not way I can look at it correctly. Besides that, it's a great monitor ^^"
4,Beautiful but flawed,"The monitor looks great, and I'm very happy with it.The only downsides are that bright colors are REALLY bright, and change slightly with viewing angle, which causes problems if you're editing photographs. Also, there is a slightly dark patch at the top right of the screen, but only slight - I didn't notice it until I switched to a light wallpaper.Overall, very good for the price. If you have a choice, of course get a B or C (I got an A)"
5,Fantastic Monitor,"This monitor has to rate up there with the best. I love it! It has great color, contrast, and speed. It's also uses very little electricity."
1,No Samsung customer service,"My one star is not because this is a bad monitor, but because Samsung will not stand by their product and warranty claims. My monitor completely went out 2 months after the warranty period, however, since we had registered our product online, Samsung offered a extended 3 month warranty (the offer is on its website as of today!). Customer dis-service however would not honor that commitment, and basically rudely dismissed me."
5,Amazing,"This monitor is huge, very bright, and has an amazing picture. Great for gaming with 2ms. I heard that the C panel was alittle worse than an S but i can't tell i difference. Alittle blacklight bleed but nothing big. Overall for the price it is a great monitor!"
5,Great light!,"I purchased this light in brushed nickel for my vaulted-ceiling foyer. It arrived on time and is even prettier in person than in the picture. The packaging was really well done, so there was definitely no damage. The light is nice and bright without being too powerful. It looks beautiful from the street at night. I had an electrician do the installation so I can't really comment on that aspect of the product. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend this product."
4,My new favorite,"This is definitely my new favorite flavor of microwave popcorn, it tastes as good as it sounds, the only thing I could ask is for fewer unpopped kernels at the bottom of the bowl."
2,Nothing like corn on the cob...,This tastes nothing like buttered corn on the cob. In fact it tastes exactly like regular salted white popcorn with no butter. On the positive side it's not greasy... but don't expect anything exciting from the taste.
1,two thumbs down,"i wish i had back my old panasonic. the braun syncro cleaning system is nice, but not worth the poor shave the razor offers. i have owned my braun syncro for over a year now and am disappointed with the shave. the razor ignores hairs every once and a while (especially if they are longer from not shaving for a day or two) in random locations and is unable to give a decent shave under the chin and around my adam's apple. since i started using the braun system i have also had problems with in-grown hairs. this is a problem i never had with my old electric razor. even though i like the idea of a self-cleaning razor it is of little benefit when the razor doesn't give you a decent shave."
3,many disappointments,"I've owned the Braun Synchro for over a year. I was excited by the self cleaning feature .. until I realized I was cleaning my shaver with VERY dirty alcohol after the first few cleanings. Although the cleaning might seem convenient, I found it to be more annoying than useful and went back to the brush & wastebasket method. And, the shaver and cleaner were much noisier than I would like. I had previously owned Norelco shavers that never shaved close .. but were gentle on my very sensitive throat area. The Braun shavers DO shave closer but aren't quite as gentle as I require and I still come away with nicks on a fairly regular basis. I am about to try the latest Norelco Quadro and will report on that after I've tried it."
4,"It takes time, but you will love this shaver!","Ok, let me be honest here: I bought this thing 10 months ago just because it looked cool. I had never used an electric shaver before, but I was tired of the itch and pain of my normal razor. So I decided to spend the extra bucks and get this one.I hated it and wanted to return it after one month of use. It was awful and I always ended shaving with a razor. My neck was full of ugly hair after several minutes of work with the Syncro. I almost gave up several times, but something always made me go back to it.And now, 10 months later, I cannot live without this thing. It is so fast, smooth, and easy to operate. I totally love the way it works and just can't think of any other shaver or razor.It takes time and it is expensive, but it is worth it if you have some patience."
2,Pretty bad shave,"When I lost my Norelco 6885XL (which is Norelco's equivalent top-of-the-line razor), I bought this. I shouldn't have. The shave that I get from the Braun is much less smooth than from the Norelco (although a regular safety razor like a Mach 3 beats them both by a decent margin, regardless of what the ads say). This one has a fancy electronic cleaning system that requires buying a cleaning cartridge every month or so. It still doesn't seem to be any cleaner than the Norelco, which just needs to be washed. I find myself having to shave the same areas of my face over and over and over to get a semi-reasonable shave. Trust me, just buy the 6885XL instead, and you most likely won't be disappointed. It's a much better razor."
1,It looks like a child's colouring book.,This book was a complete letdown to me. It struck me as a child's colouring book instaid of a guide to Scandinavian artwork.
3,Better for fine lines,"Although it is not a miracle coverup for deeper lines (between eyes), it is a nice additional cream to easily wear under makeup."
1,Very Basic Text,"This textbook is very good for high school students with little or no knowledge of auto repair, tools or procedures. The book will not provide enough information to perform any procedures, but will be vey helpful in learing what are the different types of screwdrivers, hammers, etc. used in auto repair.This text needs to be followed by a much more in depth text."
5,2 1/2 men dvd's,All I can say is.....super fast delivery and I order a lot. I have never had a problem with Amazon or the products they send me. I know I can always feel good when I order from them.
4,season seven,"Well, works fine and all, wasn't packaged as well as I would like and the little plastic disc holders in the actuall case were broken, letting the discs slide around thus scratching them up a bit."
4,The Longest Road,"I read this book for a school report, and it kept me engaged throughout the book. Laurie is an amazing person who has learned so much at a young age by the tragedies that have come to her. She is a great charactor."
5,PaperBoy (SEGA GENESIS),My all time favorite game! I spent a whole lot of quarters back in the day playing the arcade game where ever they had it!
5,Best Non-stick i have used,These are a bit more pricey than normal teflon pan. But my use so far shows them to be superior. Lower heatsettings while cooking and very easy cleanup. Paper towel to wipe out and there is no visible residue remaining.Looking to buy the bigger 12.5 inch pan for bigger portions.
4,Jet a little weak,"--- November 27, 2002 ---The whole set is great. I don't think I've ever felt my teeth so clean, and the timer feature is very useful. Everybody can use it, and it doesn't take that much space.One little drawback: the Oxi Jet pressure is a little weak, even at its maximum, 5.---------- UPDATE ------------I, unfortunately, had to get rid of my set. The motor for the water jet pump would not stop, unless I unplugged the whole unit. I had to send it to a Braun/Oral B certified repair guy. The repair plus the shipping cost about as much as I had paid for the unit itself. When I finally received it back, the battery charger wasn't working anymore... :-/ I'd rather spend the money on a brand new one than having to pay to have it repaired every other month.I have not replaced it yet, but plan on doing so."
5,A marvelous comeback for four of country's best singers.,"The Old Dogs is without a doubt, the best cd to come out of country music in a long time. Every song is filled with the catchiest and funniest lyrics I've heard in a while. They explain perfectly the perils of aging in a way that almost makes you want to get there sooner."
2,kibble,"There is no bigger Jerry Reed fan than me. And I love the music of Bobby Bare and Waylon Jennings. I admit, Mel Tillis as a singer has never done much for me, although I admire his songwriting. Given that, except for Waylon, these Old Dogs can't get record labels to roll over for them, it's disappointing that this heavily marketed effort isn't better. The blame, in my opinion, rests soley on Shel Silverstein's silly shoulders. With only a couple of exceptions, this is a weak bunch of songs. Reed and Jennings have written far better material on their recent outtings, and this one could have benefited by some of their talents. ""Nashville is Rough on the Living"" and ""Me and Jimmie Rogers"" are fine songs. But, Bare's cut them before -- and with more elan, too. Here's hoping that next time out, someone lets the Old Dogs off Silverstein's leash..."
1,Pretentious art fluff,"Pretentious art fluff that attempts to masquerade as ""music"". In all, it just resembles electronic noise that is both disturbing and tedious to listen to. I could get the same effect if I watched a lunatic bang on garbage drums for one hour."
1,Non Stick Surface Fails Again,"We have tried just about every major brand of non stick surface, and after several months of use, the surface starts to peel. Swiss Diamond is no better. We were excited to use the fry pan, and it worked very well, until a short few months later when the surface began to get damaged by routine cooking. We are going to try scanpan next, but we are not holding our breath. The salesperson at Sur La Table swears by it. If that does not work, we will use stainless steal or cast iron (yes the heavy stuff!)."
5,great pan,I hadn't purchased cookware in almost a decade so I did some research into quality products.I purchases 2 Swiss diamond pans and they quicklybecame my favorites. I have no regrets. They cook evenly with very little oil or butter.I can wipe them clean with a paper towel. I will purchase again.
1,this is a spring gun,this is a spring gun just for kids all plastic the accessories no good no recomended for airsoft player ...
1,M16-A4 Airsoft Rifle w/Spring Action,"Quality - piece of crap. Wasn't even the item we ordered. But, the spring inside fell off inside the gun and wouldn't/couldn't even shoot out a airsoft BB. This occurred the first time the trigger was pulled to shoot the first airsoft BB. Returned the item for a refund and they only wanted to give me a store credit so I could order another piece of quality crap. The cost of shipping back and forth - has now exceeded the price of the item orignally ordered !!!M16-A4 Airsoft Rifle with LED illuminator, laser sight & adjustable gun stockI told them it was unacceptable....for them to please refund the amount of item back to the credit card on file."
2,what the...,dude i literally took this gun to my roof and dropped it off. and can u believe it broke?!!! omg... besides that this gun is o.k. i was aiming outside my window and shot an old dude. lol he dropped dead. haha get the gun dude. just dont drop it off a 4 story house cause it might brake. i know guns. i haved a 99.99 fps in school. me smart buy dis guan. but rememb er do not drop from 4 stories. this gun goes 83 gpa. i love it!!!
3,Is it safe for kids to shoot at each other?,My boys want air soft guns to shoot at each other. In the house at close range. Is this toy gun safe for that?
3,for those whosay that they are experts...,Ok. This is directed to the reviewers who say that they are experts and think that the gun does not hurt. Here are a few steps for you to take.1. Load the gun2. put the gun into full auto3. aim the gun at your face.4. hold down the trigger.5. tell me if it hurt..and can someone tell me how the LED illuminator is? IS it super ultra bright like an led flashlight or is it plastic junk?
3,"Very powerful, But No Laser","I got the gun yesterday and I think it's awesome. I shot it at a glass bottle and it exploded.It's very powerful, but there's one thing that disappointed me. that it's suppose to come with a laser but it didn't. Overall, the guns great."
3,For those who complain...,"This review is for all the people who are complaining cuz this guns crap. Just wait awhile and save. Then u can get a good airsoft gun. And for the kid who said this thing shoots good for an airsoft gun, my Echo 1 ak47 is full metal, shoots at 380 fps, and has an effective range of 200 ft. And it was $150. If u want a good airsoft gun just save like i did.P.S. The ak has never jammed in the several years ive had it."
1,Pure garbage!,"My 10 year old son has wanted an air soft gun for a long time to play with his friends who also have them. We told him he needed to save his allowance and pay for it himself if he wanted a gift so soon after Christmas. He searched the web for several weeks until he found this gun. He begged and I finally relented since he had waited a sufficient amount of time and had saved his own money. There were several issues immediately. This cheap piece of cr@p will load a pellet into the chamber on rare occasions, and you'll never know when it will fire. In addition, the laser light was broken and has never worked. Instructions are in Chinese so good luck figuring that out. Tell your children this is a single-shot rifle (if you get lucky and it happens to fire), it's deceptive and has a lever for single shot and multiple shot, but it does not work in that manner. This thing is built cheap, VERY flimsy. DO NOT BUY THIS! Buying this is equivalent to flushing your money down the toilet."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IS HORRIBLE!!,"I bought this product on a Friday and arrived on a Thursday...Good shipping time but a horrible gun. The pieces are hard to assemble and made of cheap plastic. The whole gun was made of a cheap plastic which is not worth buying. I payed $30 for this gun and wasted my gift card for my birthday...Complete waste. The laser's wires split, the gun does not shoot fully automatic and the FPS (feet per second) is slower than my Berretta Pistol. Also the binoculars are cheap as well...it is just a gimmick to make you buy the product. Use your best judgement when buying this gun but it was not worth the $$"
1,ITS A RIP OFF,DO NOT BUY THIS GUN.It didn't shoot like a auto gun and it didn't come with a laser.It wasn't what I expected.
2,Needs to be described different..,The gun showed up quick which was nice but... It did NOT come with the laser sight which disapointed me.. Gun shoots alright but it is not semi-auto like it says.. For what I payed its ok but description needs to change..
3,Wondering if I can get all that's advetised?,"I saw in the order details that I was getting the light, lase and grip. But I also saw that it comes complete with saftey goggles, a gun strap and also 100 bb's. I was wondering do they or do they not come with it? I actually have not recieved it yet just want to know."
1,do not buy anything from this place@!!!!,i was sent a gun that broke immediadtely but i like how it fired before i broke it i did the mistake of orderinf another one took it back to the shop and they told me all of theryre gun were defective they purposely unload crappy guns on you do not waste your money.
2,Not Worth Buying,"I'm 13 years old and I bought this gun. My friends and I are in to airsoft and I thought this was a good gun. I mean it has a laser and comes with goggles but the truth is:The laser isn't even acurate.The goggles are cheap and fall off.The BBs curve left.And this gun isn't fully automatic. You have to pump it after every shot. After my friend and I got this gun the only cool think was the light that goes on it. Not to bright, good for playing at night.I would look at the other available guns if I were you.(Especially begginers.)"
3,OK for the money,This is relatively inexpensive and is ok. I originally thought this had electric/battery auto feed but it does not. I guess I misread the advertisement.
2,A regrettable purchase.,"First off, this gun is NOT automatic. Even though there is a deceptive switch for, Semi and Automatic. If you're looking for an automatic one, look else where.Second, the instructions that come with it are laughable. A single piece of paper, one side has pictures of other types of guns (I'm assuming other products the company sells). The other, has the directions. But low and behold, the instructions aren't just for this gun. I could be mistaken though, since there is very little English and you must rely on the TINY pictures, and SMALL print to assemble.The accessories are nice, though seemingly pointless, and the gun seems to be made from a hard plastic. Once you do figure it out, it is relatively easy to assemble and disassemble."
1,your so right,the guy who said this gun sucks is right hay man right a review to tell these people how much this gun sucks
1,BEWARE,I will never deal with this company again! My product arrived late and was obviously very old due to the corroded batteries in the airsoft gun. It would not work after we cleaned it and I got no response from the company.I had to throw away the gun along with my money.I have enjoyed Amazon in the past but would appreciate them reviewing who they allow us to do business with.Thanks
1,Semi auto air soft A4,It is not what my son expected. It was advertised to be able to switch from semi to auto. He spent his Christmas money on it. Very disappointed.
3,Knitter,"Well...it is what it is. Definitley NOT a toy. Looks exactly like an M-16. So much so that my husband has been hoarding it. I (mom) am not happy, but that's not the fault of the manufacturer. This came up under a search for ""toy guns"" and never having heard of airsoft agreed to let them buy it not realizing it was a real BB gun."
3,More matters for Radio Dept,"I'm not sure where all the shoegaze comparisons are coming from, perhaps the closest would be the poppier side of the Boo Radleys, but 'Lesser Matters' is actually more along the lines of Broken Social Scene, trippy experimental rock. One one hand there's an ethereal/breezy quality typical of shoegaze bands, eg, Slowdive. But on the otherhand, there's an interesting combination of Pet Sounds-like experimentalism and psychadelic-laced electronica, eg, Prefuse 73, Manitoba. If anything, 'Lesser Matters' meets Badly Drawn Boy with electronica, still breezy, still unique, with a sonic soundscape vibe that the Swedes are good at."
4,Great Study Guide,"I did each of the Hands On assignments, then went back and studied what I struggled with. I aced the test today. The book was structured well and was easy to understand. I will be using other books by these authors."
3,"Strong in content, weak in organization","Just as the other reviewers stated, this book was ok in content and terrible in organization. It was a useful study guide by annoying at time to use."
2,Save your money,"Looks like a great product, right? Think again.The brush head does ""pulsate"" rapidly, but you can get the same sensation and cleaning by properly brushing. Not that most peopel spend 10 minutes on brushing, but to use this is a whole oredeal. It takes much longer to clean than your regular toothbrush. And G-d forbid you shoudl need a replacement head, what a hassle to attach.Reach for a regular toothbrush and save your cash."
4,Great every night.,"I have been using the Plaque remover for the past 2 years and have yet to hear something bad from my dentist. The plaque remover has a timer (2mn) that helps you time your brushing so that you do not keep going for more then needed.The battery life is good for a week-end, but after three nights of use without charging the plaque remover stops on you teeth. That is the only down side.Previous to this I used the Sonicare, I thought Sonicare was too gentle on my teeth. I tested this at my friends place (with my own brush) and thought the feeling was much better.Have fun brushing."
4,Fun and diverse,"This is a great compliation, headed by the New Morty Show's fantastic version of ""Enter Sandman"". Fun and diverse this collection is a great way to get into the neo-swing movement. It will give you an idea who is out there and what kind of music they play."
1,"If you love Aretha, buy her music. . .","but please don't buy this book. I have adored Aretha since I was a child, and as far as I am concerned, her voice and her interpretation of music are both unparalleled. Reading her book, however, is another matter. Here is a serious case of TMI--too much information--about someone you want to put up on a pedestal. I have read several other books on which Mr. Ritz collaborated, notably the recent B.B. King autobiography, and I have to assume that Ms. Franklin didn't choose to avail herself adequately of his services. The Aretha you will find here is no queen; she is all too human. Please, continue to love her and buy one of her CDs instead!"
1,Fallen Queen Delivers Less-than-truthful autobiography,"A major disappointment. PR-version of her life story that even she is starting to believe. Does not deliver the truth, the grit. This is the church version so the sisters in the Amen corner won't be too shocked -- though most of them know more of the real story than is spooned out here.Like her recent albums, this is a cop-out.Aretha, Aretha, this book is beneath ya."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I, too, have been an Aretha fan forever. But, boy was I disappointed, long before I finished reading her book. I feel Aretha left me hanging in a lot of areas that she touched on and indicated ""more on that later"" which never came. There was waaaaaay too much information on her father, more detailed than I needed. She could remember and describe the names, taste and places to buy good food, but she could not remember why she had words with or cannot remember why she and Gladys Knight no longer get along. Amazing! I went out and bought this book the day after her appearance on Oprah. I wish I had waited, because I'm sure this book will be given away on the Clearance tables by Christmas. The book had no direction and was very poorly written. Mr. Ritz must have had his eyes closed when he read/reviewed this book."
2,WHY ?,"After finishing up this book, the only words left in my mind were ""Ree, how could you! Though I do not think the book was as poor as other reviewers, I must admit I expected much more from her in terms of speaking on her experiences, highs AND lows, in the music business, as well as the significant lessons she has learned reaching this point in her life and career. But what did I learn most about her? She's a greedy pig! Every piece of food she has ever eaten she can recall, but recording dates and personal issues she's all a-blur.I did appreciate her vivid memory of her early gospel days and of her dad back in Detroit. That was clearly the best part of the book and seemed the most unbiased accounts recollected for this memoir. In light of David Ritz's prior works, I am quite puzzled as to what went wrong with this assignment? I think Aretha should stick to writing songs and leave the books for the experts. I love her and am forever a fan."
3,Not enough info,I read the book in two days. If she wasn't going to give names I think she shouldn't have written the book. Every chapter almost she was talking about food. I hope she gets over addiction.
2,Very Disappointed!,"This book was easy reading because there was not much there to read. Story lines left unfinished and the book jumps back and forth. There is no doubt that Areatha Franklin is the Queen of Soul, but this book did not and could not have done her justice. I've read magazine articles that portray her as a more warm and complete person.The Queen deserves a better written biography."
1,PR-fluff being passed off as autobigraphy,"Don't waste your time. I've loved Aretha since I was a child, but boy, it's getting harder and harder to justify the acclaim. I see why people are dissing her everywhere. Overrated, overinflated ego, coasting on a reputation. She may have been the Queen of Soul in the '60s -- whatever the heck that means -- but there are so many other fine vocalists who can out-sing her any day of the week -- Patti Labelle, Jennifer Holliday, Chaka Khan, just to name a few -- and this autobiography will do nothing to regain her crown. She comes off as a pompous, unlikable b-word. A very unhappy woman. And a very out-of-touch woman. Like someone said, the Norma Desmond of popular music.Don't waste your time with this tripe."
2,simply dreadful,"I preface this review the way I always do when I write about Aretha Franklin. I am a long time fan and admirer. Lord knows the Queen of Soul has a heck of a story to tell. What's disappointing is that she doesn't really tell it. This is lightweight, to say the very least. SO MUCH is left to speculate, Aretha is cagey about many events, many people. In other words, if you're not gonna write a warts and all autobiography, and leave yourself open to the world, to your FANS, who really want the details, then don't do one at all. The only impression this book left me with is the enormity of Aretha Franklin's self-importance, and utter self-righteousness. A much better book is ""Queen of Soul."""
2,No server software provided,"If you have WIN98SE this is not for you. Few media servers are out there that work with WIN98SE.This review is based on the M500, which I tried.This unit comes with NO server software.Uses a Compactflash plug in card for wireless operation. Hokey.Small display making navigation difficult.I passed on this one and got the Dlink DSM320, which does streaming internet audio, video, audio, and photos, and uses your TV for a display."
5,An Amazing Adventure in Historical Fiction!!!,"The instant I picked up this book, I couldn't put it down. The Patriote Propostion had amazing action and mystery that kept me reading throughout the night. I had to get to the bottom of this whirlwind of constant excitement and gripping cliff-hangers. I never imagined a book could be so EXCITING!!!"
4,Years of Use,This is great way to encourage a child and teach responsibility. You can change to your child's needs so this can grow with them. Love the magnets!
5,A great motivator for the kids,My kids love doing chores now. They get very excited to put a magnet showing what they have accomplished each day. One of the best motivator for the kids that aids in learning and helping.
3,Too bulky but well made,"I bought two of the boards to use with my toddler twins. It is well made - very sturdy. It's also flexible and offers a lot of different options for the areas you want to work on with your kids. However, I'm not using it. It's so large and bulky. I don't have a place to hang the boards. Because it uses magnets, it's not easy to fold up without accidentally moving all of the pieces. It would be better if the pieces locked in place. Plus, the kids would prefer to play with the magnets. I'd prefer something softer and something that maybe you have to turn instead of placing magnets. It's so easy to mess up the magnets and then you can't really keep track. It's a big problem if you use this with more than one kid."
2,I thought it would be better...................,"I bought this responsibility chart with the idea it would be helpful for my two kids. I loved the bright colors and all of the choices (I especially liked the no whining and no hitting)-- however, even when storing the extra magnets in a separate area, every time it gets bumped the magnets on there fall off. I have tried moving it to several different spots- but with two kids and a dog- it seems inevitable. Great idea- but too messy to pick up all the time."
5,Love this chart!,"I have been researching a responsibility chart for my little guy for the past year. I had originally seen this in another store for a much higher price. Since it is going to be a Christmas present we haven't opened it up to use it yet. But, from just seeing it in person, I am anxiously awaiting the holidays to get here so we can open it up and get it into action."
2,Warped,The board warped within 2 weeks of purchasing. I had it hanging from the wall by the cord it came with. Now not all the magnets will stay on the board.
3,"Like it, don't love it","This is a very cute and fun product.The bad news, it has some limitations worth noting. This board is for one child, and there is no great way to use it for multiple kids as far as I've figured out. And, I'm not willing to use up that much space in my house for 'chore charts' to purchase multiple products. Also, the magnets are not very strong and are easily knocked off which is sort of silly for a magnetic chore chart. Also, this item is large and decently heavy, so you will need a good spot to hang, not a major draw back but a consideration.The good news, my kids love marking off the items they have accomplished (5yr, 4yr) and the categories are pretty good. Many of the categories are behaviors not responsibilities.Again, cute product but has some limitation in my opinion."
5,Who knew chores could be so fun? Especially for Parents!,"I picked this up as a half-serious/half-joking Christmas gift for my wife and she LOVED the idea of it! The kids are really into it. I have two boys, 10 and 6. Both boys are excellent boys but getting them to help out at home was becoming more of a challenge. With the help of this chart, we implemented a small weekly allowance. It works like magic! If they fail to do what they are assigned to do, they get points taken away... which is less money for them! They have already earned two weeks worth of allowance and were able to save up for small toys that they wanted. So, they see that it works, and they see that we follow through with the reward (and punishment). It's just outstanding! Many of our friends have seen the chart and immediately and want one for their family. It was money WELL spent! Melissa & Doug toys are 5-Star for a reason. They are imaginative, simple, and effective!"
4,good -- but weird -- but good,"This is a weird little gadget. Technically, it's been flawless. We plugged it in, we charged it, it worked. Since then, it's continued to work.The weirdness is in the way it feels. Even at its stronger setting, it's very gentle. I'm used to mashing my brush against my teeth like some kind of barbarian dental hygenist. With this, if I press too hard, it complains.The real test, though, is its ability to clean my teeth. When I finish using this thing, my teeth feel at least as clean as if I used a manual brush. I feel like they shouldn't, but they do. I'm sure I'll get used to it.It works. What else is there to say?"
5,Just like the best reviews said!,"This is a very powerful toothbrush, yet does not damage the gums like so many I have tried in the past. I am particularly pleased with that fact. My teeth do feel like I have just visted the dentist for a cleaning and it is great getting between the teeth. I would recommend this to anyone who may be reluctant to purchase this.....it does the job with out hurting the gums."
5,works great!,My folks recommended getting one of these - nothing bad in my experience so far (about 4 months). Recharges overnight and lasts for about 2-3 weeks. Wish they had supplied a travel case or something ...it's gone off in my luggage before. Makes your teeth feel squeaky clean and the two-minute feature helps out.
2,Not even in the same league as the Philips Sonicare,I used my father's Sonicare toothbrush for a few days. I was utterly impressed with its cleaning ability. So when I went home I purchased this toothbrush thinking they were the same. It is nowhere near the Sonicare. Spend the extra money on the Sonicare...you will thank me later.
5,better than a dentist,"this is my second and I love this product , last one lasted sevral years until it stopped taking a charge ... had to get another ... cleans excellently and would not go back to regular brushing ever again ..."
5,May help prevent heart disease as well as cavities,"There has been a documented relationship between plaque on your teeth and heart attacks, which is why I decided to buy this toothbrush. This model was found to be more effective at reducing plaque than other electric or manual brushes by a study done in England. I use it twice a day for the full 2 minutes and follow it with floss - it feels like I just left the dentist's office after a thorough cleaning. It seems expensive until you compare it to the cost of one dental cleaning and realize you're getting the same feeling everyday. It's definitely worth it!"
4,clean teeth,"I love my new toothbrush. Teeth never felt so clean. My only disappointment was that there was no alarm to let you know when you have been brushing for two minutes. The description of the product suggested that there was one. Apparently the brush just pauses for a moment. Other than that, I am very pleased."
5,very satified,Works better than expected. For years I always used another well known brand. Now I am glad having made the change.
4,works Great,I have used a blade all my life and will never go back! I love this razor. I refil the cleaning cartrige with alcohol and spray lubricate the razor with Remington SP-4 Shaver Saver. Works Great.
1,Braun Synchro reliability,I bought this for my husband last Christmas. The razor works great but we have had to get the clean & charge base repaired 3 times in less than 1 year. The service time from Braun is awful. We have been waiting 3 weeks so far for our 3rd repair and my husband has been cleaning the razor manually which is a pain over long periods of time and the razor doesn't work as well when it is cleaned manually. I am disappointed in the reliablity and the length of time it takes Braun to get the problem resolved.
2,Nice all around,"The razor is very nice, but I got some razor burn after my first shave. Hopefully it will go away in a week or two and hopefully it will also shave closer.All I want to do now is find out how the hair clippings are cleaned from the unit, where do they go out of the razor?? They can't fit thru the little foil holes, can they?"
3,"Okay, but not worth the price","I bought this for my husband because he really liked the idea of a self-cleaning razor. It worked okay for a month or so and then broke. He sent it in for repair and it came back working properly. A few months later, it broke again. Again it was fixed. Props to customer service for this.Since we were already going broke paying for the cleaning solutions, when it broke a third time, we decided it wasn't worth the hassle and bought a different one."
4,Good shaver,"I bought the Braun 7526 shaver for my fiance for Christmas. He has sensitive skin so shaving wasn't something he did very frequently (much to my dismay). This shaver has worked out very well for him. I would rate it with 5 stars except he has had some trouble getting the hairs right under his chin on his neck trimmed. He loves the cleaning system. We forgot the cord at his parents' house for 2 weeks so it had gotten pretty grimy with hair in the meantime. Once we got cord he cleaned it and it came out looking brand new. He's shaving daily now so it seems to work well for him and he isn't experiencing any irritation at all. The thing people say about your face needing to ""adjust to the razor"" is true. I can't explain why, maybe it's just getting used to shaving with an electric razor, but he wasn't getting a close shave at all at first and now he is as smooth as if he had used a straight blade. Nice product and we're recommending it to our other male family members."
2,"Average shave, high consumables cost","I've had the 7526 for almost two years now. The shave is average, but the cost of consumables has been what I feel is high. Besides the cleaning cartridges (at approx $4.50/ea), I've had to replace cutterheads twice in the two years. The foil wears through exposing the cutters making replacement necessary. Given their replacment cost, I figure they should last longer than 8 months..... I'd been a Norelco user for a long time prior to the Braun, and I'll soon be switching back...."
1,cleaner stinks up bathroom & breaks,"The shaver is good, but I had to get rid of that awful automatic cleaner/lubricator; it was full of isopropyl alcohol and it made the bathroom smell like a hospital. Plus, it got stuck & wouldn't open to replace the little tanks of alcohol-cleaner. The whole cleaning apparatus broke apart & made a mess."
3,"Good Shave, but Poor Construction","This gives the best shave out of any electric that I've tried, and is rated highest in performance by consumer reports as of november '03.However, within 1 year of use something inside the cleaning apparatus malfunctioned, and within 2.5 years something inside the shaver itself malfunctioned.The malfunctions were not serious, and would be easy to fix, if not for the fact that both devices are apparently designed to be very difficult to take apart. Perhaps a schematic of the devices would make this easier, but none seems to be available.I assume that they were designed this way in order to generate revenue for the repair business, or because it is cheaper to produce the devices in this way."
2,Disappointing and inefective.,"I have hyper sensitive skin, and this shaver did not work for me. I tried using it a few times and did I not get a good shave out of it. It irritated my skin and I eventually just got rid of it and went back to razors. I"
5,Great set-up...a clean razor every day.,"I Read some of the reviews - good and bad- and decided to buy this for my husband for Christmas. He just loves it. He's had no problems at all so far, and he loves getting a clean razor every day. I would recommend this product very highly."
4,"Interesting and enjoyable, but ending left me hanging","I really enjoyed this book until the last few pages or so. It reads kind of like Harushi (The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle) Murakami throughout most of it - very interesting examination of Japanese society, believable characters with real, every day kinds of issues and problems, etc. But the end had one major disappointment, that being that the reader is left wondering what in the world becomes of one of the key characters in the book. It doesn't really impact the ""mystery"" aspect of the story, it's just that it left me with a lack of a sense of closure about this one central character. Other than that, I thought it was a great read."
2,Disjointed and confusing,"While the premise of this story is intriguing, the style with which it is written left me cold. It was too confusing trying to figure out the husbands, boyfriends and children. And it is too predictable in the chain of events.Linda C. WrightAuthor, One Clown ShortOne Clown Short"
2,an average novel,"I was sorely disappointed in Evening. The concept was interesting and parts of the novel contained beautiful descriptions and dialouge, but other sections just seemed incoherent. An even larger problem for me was that the ""love story"" centered around a very problematic situation. I'll avoid spoiling the book, but let's just say that unless you are a die-hard romantic you might want to try something else. By the way, this was my office's book club selection for August and no one enjoyed the book."
1,Evening,I saw the movie and thought I'd like to read the book but I just can't get into it. I never give up and I will finish it when I am desperate for something to read.
3,Disappointing story despite engaging dying state,"One questions the depth of Ann's sentiments knowing her age and her rather privileged life. Why would a woman who's had three marriages, five children, and a wealth of personally enriching joyous and tragic experiences, spend her dying days reminiscing a shallow, two-talking, poor-excuse-of-a man? Ann's infatuation of Harris when she was 25 is understandable, excusable. But, as most of us know, it's the memories of the good men in our past we choose to preserve-- even of those whose feelings we were unable to reciprocate. Holding torches to cads quickly dissipates as we grow up wanting to meet and love the honest, well-intentioned, trustworthy men we hope to share our lives with."
4,Insightful take on memory and thought processes,"I'd been reading reviews about this book for months but hesitated to pick it up because I wasn't interested in the genre. Eventually I caved in and had a great reading experience. Most compelling were Minot's depictions of thoughts and feelings of a dying woman. Anne's jumbled memories are actually lucid and coherent insights. I could relate to her alternating feelings of happiness and remorse about the past. There is a peaceful, fatalist undertone.Not sure if men would enjoy this book as much as women, but the style and story content were interesting and well thought-out to me.Minot builds excellent characters, writes beautifully and can tell a good story."
4,Sensitive presentation of difficult subject,Death is a difficult concept for any of us to consider and Susan Minot has been able to show the reader how death comes. Cancer is presented sensitively with a vividness that is real. Ann Lord is a protrayed as a complex and the reader is made to care about her from the first chapter.
1,don't waste your money,I bought this unit for my 14 year old son. The CD player skipped. We took it back and exchanged it. The second unit had the same problem. We took it back and got a refund.
1,Save Your Money for Something Better,"The RCA RS1289 was a gift that seemed to fit my needs: small size, CD changer, Bass enhanced speakers, cassette dubbing, tuner, clock. What a disappointment! I've had some RCA products in the past that were very good quality, but this item is nothing but frustration. To start with, to set the clock you must be very fast and dexterous or the setting times out and you have to start all over. It is not easy to set, and every time there is a power fluctuation the clock must be reset since there is now memory or battery backup. The two tape players were adequate and worked fine. The CD changer has a belt drive, the belt being a small rubber band-like part that broke during the first year of use. The CD player is useless. The AM/FM tuner works OK but isn't user friendly as far as having presets or scan features to find other stations. I've tried to nurse this system along, but frankly it is more trouble than it is worth."
3,Pass the mustard...Hamburger rocks!!!,Hamburger is a must see for all of us who survived this typical bad 80's genre....can't get enough of the cheesy theme song either!! America is gettin' burger hungry....now I know what I've been missing! Dick Butkus is classic!
3,crazing on Sorrento dishware,"Several years ago I purchased 12 dinner plates, 12 salad plates, 12 cereal bowls, 12 mugs, and a number of extra pieces in ivory, including the canister set, serving bowls, and casserole dish. I loved the pattern on the dishes and didn't mind the subtle variations in coloring. However, even though it says microwave safe on the dishware, after using small plates to warm up leftovers, the dishes started crazing. I immediately stopped using dishes in the microwave, but the crazing continued to get worse. I noticed over time, washing the dishes in the dishwasher caused crazing also because the large plates had never been put in the microwave. It appears that the dishware can't withstand a lot of heat & is not microwave or dishwasher safe. I am really disappointed in the appearance of my dishes now after a few years of use. The lines and marks that are on the dishes now are very ugly."
2,not quite great,"I ordered 12 plates. They were ivory with a sort of rubbed off finish around the edges. Some of the plates had it and some didn't so they were inconsistent. One plate arrived broken. I kept them just to not hassle with returning them, and just bought another plate at a store to complete the set."
5,I Love this Product!,"I have had this product for five years now and I still love it! My husband and I use it probably about 2 - 3x per month. The only problem we have had is when you lift up the mat, you have to be careful not to pull out the suction cups. After my husband ripping out so many, we got a replacement for only $20.00. Not bad. Other than that, I love it!"
3,Your experience might depend on the type of tub,"I've read complaints from other reviewers about the mat not sticking to the bottom of the tub. When I first got the bubble mat, I had a fiberglass tub and the mat never ever stuck to the bottom of the tub. It was frustrating and not very relaxing to try to lay in the tub and try to keep the bubble mat from floating to the surface. But when I moved to a new place with a ceramic glazed tub, the suction cups actually held very tightly. What a difference in experience! The air pressure is strong enough to generate lots of bubbles and I always feel massaged and more relaxed afterwards. However, I can only give this 3 stars because the thing is so damn noisy! In a small bathroom, the sound just echos. It's sometimes nice when you want to block out other outside sounds that you want to escape, but when I want a nice quiet bath, I leave out the bubble mat."
4,Double-faced doggie door plastic replacement,"The merchandise was sent in a box that has distorted the product. This particular door evidently is no longer made, and it is disappointing that the rubber has molded into the size of the box and leaves a gap. I have used this type of door for 30 years and I love it (but not the replacement sent by Amazon.)"
3,Pretty good album.,"This debut album from 'Til Tuesday is pretty good. None of the songs are bad--they are all listenable. I like some of them better than others, though. 'Til Tuesday plays some good pop music throughout. I like Aimee Mann's vocals (they're really good). She also does really well with the bass guitar duties--I dig the bass licks to the intro of ""Love in a Vacuum."" 'Til Tuesday's musicianship is tight. The production is also not bad. I like the album's keyboard and guitar playing, too. All of the songs are quite atmospheric. The choruses are cool, also. My favorite songs are ""Love in a Vacuum,"" ""No More Crying,"" and ""Winning the War."" ""Winning the War"" is put together nicely and is impressive. I like listening to this album sometimes. It's satisfying. Worth a listen."
2,SMALLL,"I guess it was my fault for not comparing measurments. There are verny beutiful ,but really really small and fragile."
4,pretty earrings,These earrings are big enough to see yet not too big for every day use. They have nice color and clarity.
4,14K Yellow Gold Tear-shaped Garnet Drop Earrings,These are beautiful earrings. They are a little smaller than what I imagined and visualised from the photos you provided. The stones are also slightly darker than I thought they would be. However I still love them and am happy with my purchase.
2,too small,These earrings are much smaller than the picture indicates. They are cute but the price is too high for the quality you receive.
2,Cute - but TINY,I was surprised to see these when they arrived. The picture is misleading - it would be helpful to put something else in the picture to give the buyers a better idea of just how small this item truly is.
5,lovely,"My boyfriend gave me these for Christmas and I really love them. They are rather small, but I think they are perfect. I have short hair these days so they are really great about not overwhelming my ears. The stones are just gorgeous, I could stare at them all day. I say they are a great buy. :)"
3,Not what it looks like.,Her face looks nothing like her picture. I was planning to give this to my niece who only gets to play with boys most of the time. I thought it would be nice for her to get to be a princess while playing with the boys. It looks like a man with a wig and breasts.
4,Leila...,this piece is a must have only problem is dont expect the face to be anything like in the movie.....
2,No more interest,"Roazen's book has been wonderful when it was freshly printed. He had wonderful foresights. Nowadays it is completely out of tune with all the correspondence which has been published. Most of his foresights were absolutely right, but what use today? Unless it is to learn history of critical thought..."
1,1 Formatted hard drive later...,"Okay, I tried this. And I'm no slouch at making my PC work through all sorts of convoluted Windows setups, but this was impossible. I thought IE4 was bad, when it sheered off about 100Mhz from my machine speed, but this so called Operating System crippled my P2. A triumph of style over substance. I performed the standard fall over test on it. (If you leave a PC with Win 95 on it, running for 24 hours *without doing anything* it will crash all on it's own.) At least Windows 98 doesn't do this. But that's about the only good thing I have to say about it. Only upgrade Windows 95 to 98 if you're interested in seeing your old Win 95 bugs, replaced with some exciting new Win 98 bugs."
3,win98,"i'm a beta tester for apple and microsoft,i recomend buying a mac if you domt want any headaches,win95 was full of bugs when it was released and win98 will be too,but you will be able to buy the upgrades to fix the bugs.the mac on the other hand,i beta tested os8 found very few bugs,the minor ones that were there,apple offered a free upgrade.i like macs,i use both a mac and a pc,and prefer the mac,and all you ""macs suck""pc people,have you ever used one?its really plug and play vs. plug and pray."
4,A GOOD SEASON,"Season six was a good mix of plots, some changes in actors, lots of suspense, mystery, action and it's usual humor added into the mix. Really enjoyed this season."
3,Season gets better at the end,This season is a mash up as two main characters depart and a new actors enter. Some are pretty flat. Did enjoy the webisodes featuring the young interns and happy to see nerdy Steve still around the hospital.You can already guess who sticks around from the first introduction of the Mercy Westers. The crazy shooter is well-played/believable. The guy snapped and you can see it all over his face - certifiable!Richard makes a great comeback at the end... the Chief is back!
3,It's ok...,"I would not recommend this video to beginners. I've been playing guitar for over 12 years and I was still pretty bored with this video - not because I knew everything being taught, but just because it was presented in such a boring way. But I guess if you can push through the monotony and learn what is being taught, you'll be a very skilled player."
1,Save your money,Use the internet instead of killing another tree - nothing much of interest here aside from what 2 minutes on teh web will provide.
1,"Not objective, based on opinion :-(","As a muslim I found the book to be very single sided and not objective at all. The information is based on opinion not fact, it's no wonder Christians are converting to Islam by the thousands world wide, if they are being fed the opinions of their fellow Christians instead of the logic and reasoning of their religous beliefs maybe they wouldn't be so quick to convert...then again maybe that's the reason in the first place! Still, I had hoped to gain factual information and there was none."
4,the new decorating with architectural trimwork,"very good readingand informative.,but not what i was looking for .my mistake but for people in that business the book has plenty of ideas especially if r in a rut to come up with an idea for a client"
5,Almost all the information you want to know about Trimwork.,"I'm a huge DIY. Therefore please take into account that I'm not a professional contractor that knows all of the ins and outs of trim work. However, I do have more than basic knowledge of interior design and this book definitely meets all expectations. If you are working on updating a home or adding a bit of flair....this is the book for you. Lots of pictures, examples, and easy to follow format."
3,one of the better Soft Porn Videos,"This is one of Soft Porn's that is shown on Cinemax and Showtime now and then. It's one of the better ones that are more than R but not really a X movie. If you like the corny sexy soft stuff you will like this one. It has some nice girl & guy stuff and some girl & girl too.But, as in a R movie you wont see any Pink, penetration, or full frontal male nude either. If your looking for explicit X rated or stronger you won't like this one."
3,Bodasious fun,"The Erotic Dreams of Jeannie is a fun and stimulating soft-core porn flick, great for couples (my wife actually likes it a bit harder)."
5,Rubbing the Jeannie Lamp,Nicole Sheridan makes Barbara Eden look like a virgin. Nicole is one hot Jeannie. The video's story line is actually very interesting.
3,Booklist gave the book away,"Booklist told the entire story -- so why bother buying the book. It was a nice romance story, but nothing unusual. It is far better than anything that Mary Monroe has written. I'm sure we'll be hearing from this author again next year with a sequel."
5,A MUST READ,"Very good book. This is our first time reading a book by the author, and we can't wait for more.Mz. DivaBlack Book Club"
3,SONY BRANDS # 1,Affordable 5 disk player with plenty of various programable features it is a good buy.
4,works for torch fired enameling,"I've used this torch dozens of times so far with no problems. I wanted to secure the MAPP gas tank to my work bench and have a torch head that I could position freely and it does all that. The swirling flame is noisy but hot. For me it takes a few tries to light with the trigger because I'm cautious about how much I open the valve. (It takes more than a full revolution of the dial, though it might be that I'm finally running low on fuel.) I use it to fire enamel on small copper pieces. I just ordered a second one for a class I'll be teaching in a few months."
4,great fun!,"Buster and the crew, are always a pleasure to work with, and this album is truly bad manners, great fun! Tony Beet, Ex-International Beat.."
5,Excellent product! I love it!,"I received this for a Christmas present and it is by far the best manicure set I've ever tried! Everyone keeps complaining on here about a short cord-- I don't know what they're talking about! It's certainly not a 25 footer or anything, but it's plenty long enough to use while sitting at any desk or table with an electric outlet under or near it. It's stretchable (the cord that is). The attachments are high quality, and work wonders. This set is so compact! I am absolutely in love with it. My one small complaint is that the nail-dryer doesn't speed drying time that much (although it does speed it up a bit, especially the top coat, which is most important anyway). Overall, I would highly recommend this product, and I think the other raters of this product are being too picky."
3,not the best quality,"You get what you pay for and this was very inexpensive and it shows. Finish is already wearing off. I kept it anyway as it is holding a fern in my bathroom and the length of the bracket and the fact that it swivels makes it perfect for that spot. I will look for a better quality one at another time, for now this works okay."
5,The Information you need,After reading this book a new world reviled itself to me. WAP is something that's new and someting that is here to stay. If you want to learn someting about WAP... than read this book!
1,Too expensive,Don't bother to buy this book unless you are willing to invest at least one thousand dollars in incredibly expensive software. You are warned in the beginning that you can't do the lab exercises without this software. If you just want to read a book about three-tier development with Visual Basic there are certainly much better books than this one (such as Distributed COM by Maloney).
4,Great Soundtrack,"Well, I've never been able to comment with any soundtrack before. And I think this one's great, very mellifluous voices that's suiting to the movie as well. Hope you will continue to produce great song such this..."
5,The best I have ever heard,"This soundtrack is the best I have ever heard. Everything about the movie was great: the romance, the stars, the characters they played, and especially the music. It was just right for this film. Go see it, and listen to the music for yourself!!!"
4,Nice,"I recall that one comment by another, negative reviewer was that this album's music doesn't evoke the spirit of the Renaissance -- though I think the person may have used the word Medieval. Anyway, no, you won't find much if any music of an Elizabethan spirit here. It's decidedly modern in that sense, mostly very moody, though the opening theme is bouncy and optimistic. Personally, I find this album emininently listenable, and the tracks pretty much move from one to the next in comfortable fashion, so there's no centrifugal, chaotic sense to the disc, which is sometimes the case with soundtracks. My only criticism is that some of the segments do tend toward the too quiet side, and sometimes become almost interchangable in mood. Still, there's enough variety and development and introspection to make the experience worthwhile. This isn't great, but it's no slouch, either. I'd probably give it 3.5 stars overall, but that opening theme, all too brief, bumps it to 4."
4,Academy Award Category,Watching the very good film I was thinking I've got to purchase the soundtrack. It's a large part of what makes the movie so good.
5,Better than the movie!,"The music is simply unforgettable. Admittingly, I fell asleep during the movie (which isn't a reflection on the movie, but rather on myself, I seem to have a tendency to get too comfortable on my couch at home), but the music just kept re-playing over and over in my head! I couldn't find the CD and my friend ended up purchasing it as a christmas gift. My favourite is the very first track. It's on the repeat function on my hi-fi at home. Absolutely beautiful."
2,Meatless Diet for health,"I have read this book in prior editions and found it interesting but not too creative. This seems like another effort to adopt a vegan diet to the standard western high fat diet. There are a lot of casseroles, ""loafs"", breads but nothing real profound like creative salads, different ethnic variations that are not ""meat substitute"", but rather stand-alone tasty food. There is a real absence of the use of herbs and seasoning.If you want a vegan old european world ""meat and potatoes"" style of food, this is for you."
5,"GREAT BOOK,COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN",Being from a small town in Wyoming. I can relate to all the feelings of Cassidy and Daniel. How Your thoughts always return to home. No matter how far away you go. I to have fished on the middle fork of the Powder River. And the only person I ever saw hit the baseball over the Johnson's house. Was Ron Franscell himself.I think this book is definatly a Home Run. Thanks Ron for a wonderful book.
2,Not worth the money they charged,"I ordered this item only because I was short a couple dollars to qualify for free shipping when I order six pounds of replacement paraffin wax for my wife's wax machine. The other less expensive brand was $23+ for six pounds. Here, this item only cosisted of two pounds of wax and 20 plastic bags. Although the package was very nice - colorful box, individually shrink wrapped wax bar, and 20 bage with ""HoMedics"" printed all over, I was paying through the nose for nothing practical. If I had choice of other qualified (Amazon) items that would push the order into the no shipping level, I would not have ordered this - period."
4,They changed it,"The original XL is my favorite all-around flashlight. This model has been ""improved"" but I like it less than before. The LED is now regulated. This means the brightness should remain constant over a longer period. Unfortunately, the original seems brighter when loaded with fresh batteries. The head has been changed so there is now a black band around the edge of the lense. The refector is smaller. The overall shape is still the very best for holding in your hand and the regulator should enable the use of rechargeable NiMH batteries so I'll give it four stars (but just barely)."
5,Works like a charm,I wanted this to match an earlier gift from my son-in-law. MY wife and I use it in any case of emergency or other need for light. It always turns on whn needed.
2,Princeton Tec Impact XL poor choice,"I took the Princeton Tec Impact XL on a recent trip to Cayman Brac and used it for my daytime light and was very disappointed with the brightness of the light. It did a poor job of illuminating under overhangs and into nooks and crannies while looking for lobsters and micro creatures.The LED's are insufficient for all but very close up looks. I guess if I want a good bright light I should expect to pay for it. I'll go back to my old favorite - Underwater Kinetics if I can find them. I did FIND a larger Princeton Tec Shockwave II last year on a dive in Little Cayman that I carry as a backup on night dives and while not as bright as my Underwater Kinetics, it isn't as large or heavy either."
3,well made but of little interest to two years olds,"I generally love Step2 products, but not this one for the age group suggested as appropriate. The teeter totter is well-made and very attractive, but I think it would be better for older children. It did not hold the interest of my two year old twins. The rocking motion on grass is not that great, so they need to be old enough to move it better or use it on a hard surface. I think that they would be better served to make a longer/larger product that rocks better and label it for older kids."
4,Great toy - Teeter Totter,My daughter got the teeter totter and loves it! It's not that great looking as on the pictures but it occupies her a long time and can be used alone or with a friend/sister/brother.Really a fantastic investment.
4,Baby-Boomers must see!,Wow! This is a must see for any baby boomer with living parents. Very insightful.
1,Read the How-To's instead!,"I've been working with Linux now for 2 years i started off with redhat and now prefer slackware. I would say that i am now pretty proficient with linux, and i achieved this proficiency through reading the how-tos that came with linux, and from sunsite.. You'll find, if you're new to linux, that no book will ever be _THE_ book for linux, ive read a few allegedly good ones, to which readers had given quite good rates to. However i found them all to be useless when it came to getting some real-world stuff done. All these books are the same, they're all for the beginner, and even if you think of yourself a beginner i guarantee that you'll outgrow these books within 2 weeks! So the best thing is to read the How-Tos, trust me theyre really useful, and help you in REAL-WORLD problems!"
4,Fantastic Reference,This is a truly fantastic arrangement of reference material. Too bad it is so out of date. I would eagerly purchase a newer updated version.
4,Great addition to the series,This was a great read. I enjoyed the evolution of the relationships. The core characters become more interesting without betraying their essential elements. This is a fantastic series to read and reread. I can't wait for the 4th to arrive.
4,Great Web Cam - Good Quality - Easy Instillation,"This is a great web cam, I highly recomend it.Why did I give it 4 stars? Because there is one thing I dont like about it. Adjusting it. It is very hard because the cam head is so light, that the USB cord pulls it in different directions so you can't get a fixed easily. Just takes a little more effort :)Software is great. I dont really need it though becuase I use MSN Messenger and use Net Meeting which works great.I like how this is compatible with both Windows 98 and 2000. XP also.One more thing....I was reading reviews about people saying in poor lighting its terrible. Actually, its not. It still works great, they are just sm0kin the ganja. :)"
3,when working it is great,picture quality is good.camera mounting is weak. You have to be very careful when moving as camera falls off easily. Needs to be improved.connectionwith others is sometimes awkward.
4,Very Quick results ~ once you get the hang of it!,"I purchased this thermometer based on recommendations from two friends. I had difficulty taking the temps of my six month old by myself as you have to pull their ear slighly up and back in order to take an accurate temp. I had to try it several times with the help of my husband to get the hang of it. I like how a beeping sound is made once the temp has been recorded. It also has a memory feature have not used yet. One more thing ~ I accidently dropped it in the kitchen sink (in a bowl of soapy water). I picked it up quickly and set it on the counter. After two days, it had dried out and is working normally again."
3,"Good product, but needs some improvements","Sturdy and easy to use. My 2-year-old kid loves having her temp taken with this thing. In fact she can do it herself.However, if you take two readings from the same ear in quick succession, the readings can vary as much as 1 degree. That makes me wonder how accurate and consistent this thing is.Separately, the display is not back-lit, and this is an inconvenience when taking temperatures in the dark."
4,Wonderful Old-School Photos,"A collection of photos from 30 years ago. A beautiful collection of photographs from all aspects of Jewish life. The main focus is on Crown Heights Brooklyn and the Lubavitchers, though there are other photos too. Interesting to see how some things have changed, yet how much of Judaism is timeless."
5,Dream Boots,"I have been looking at these boots since last winter and this winter I decided to purchase them. I am so glad I did because there comfortable with nice rich leather tones. I wear a size 71/2 ordered 7 and they are perfect. I would recommend any one wanting a real leather boot with perfect quality and made in the USA this is it. These boots are timeless and you will get years and years out of them. So if considering a pair just do it, and you will surely get you moneys worth.P.S. JUST DO IT"
5,frye good,i bought my first pair about three weeks ago and they are incredible. i am very particular about shoes in general. These Frye boots are well made and fit like a dream. get a pair.
1,Questionable authenticity,Though these boots had the logo - the workmanship was very poor. The fit was worse. I even asked friends what they thought but everyone kept saying something doesn't look right.I was very disappointed as i have wanted a pair for ages. Sadly had to return these.
5,My Flower Girl =),"This little outfit was bought for our furry daughter HOLLY, who is a Springer Spaniel that was our flower girl in our wedding. All I did was sew a ribbon and bow around the waist that were the colors of our wedding and it was the perfect dress for our PERFECT GIRL on our SPECIAL DAY."
3,Meh,"Just another fallen Quiet Riot album.Only Stand Out for me is Red Alert, everything else, is diamal at best."
1,UBEARABLE BARING,Yikes! I'll wear slacks forever before putting my skin through this painful and useless process.Rather than removing hair it merely irritated the skin around the hair. Needless to say wasting my time and money also irritated me.European women don't even think about body hair removal. Mama mias know best.
4,Good intro book,"I highly recommend the book, especially if you can get the 'boxset' that I got, which comes with a VALinux distribution CD, a small install guide and this book, plus a demo game CD for the price of the book. I installed on an old laptop w/o CD-ROM, which the book assumes the user has. The install section is well written and easy to follow, but assumes that the user is using the CD. The biggest problem that I have is using dselect, the ""add new programs"" of the Debian distribution, because the CD is assumed again. I haven't even read the XWindows sections yet, which are a full 1/3 of the book. It does have lots of information that I'm sure I will be refering back to for some time now. A newbie book is always a good start and usually a good reference. If you have an old system (even w/o a CD - you can download Debian and make 8 install floppies very easily) get this book and get started with Linux. It really isn't difficult."
4,"A helpful, understandable guide to Linux","For those accustomed to software manuals that consistently tell you everything that's already self-evident and nothing that you wanted to know, ""Learning Debian Linux"" is a breath of fresh air. McCarty strikes a rare balance in giving you enough information to get started using and understanding the Linux system, while not overwhelming you with arcane geekspeak. Using it as a reference, it's easy to find the facts you need quickly. Yet, it's sufficiently engaging that I found myself reading on, until by weeks end, I had read it nearly cover-to-cover. I do have a few complaints. I personally would have appreciated a little more technical detail on such things as routing tables and printer fonts. I was also disappointed to find no listing of common Linux error messages which, at least to the uninitiated, can seem as cryptic and unhelpful as those issued by Macintosh or Windows. Still, on balance, this is easily one of the best computed books I have encountered."
4,Really handy,"Most of my development time is spent on Windows. But deployment almost always has been on UNIX. That's when I need to use vi sometimes, make changes to some ""make"" files, do some basic navigation and file manipulation. The Nutshell book fulfills my needs in that aspect. For advanced shell scripting or awk programming, you need to look elsewhere. But then that is not the purpose of the book anyway."
1,Broken jewel case,A excellent CD music wise but I am very disappointed with the handling of the CD. All of the little fingers that hold the CD in the jewel case were broken off on this CD and also another CD from the same order and this CD was opened! I may have received a used one.I will not order any CDs from Amazon again.
2,Dangerous for reptiles,"This thing even at its lowest setting remains way too hot. Your reptile can suffer severe burns that result in illness, death and unneeded veterinary bills. I'd agree with the other reviewer. Avoid this product."
5,Excellent help in FM batttle,"This CD has been very helpful..easy to follow, gentle and relaxing. Recommend as a good resource for self help."
2,3-1Grill/Waffle/Sandwich Marker,This is a good idea but it broke the 1st time i used it. A part broke when i was cooking.It let the juice down on the cooking unit.
3,"Okay, but not the only solution..or cheapest","I purchased a set of these to use in the RV. After seeing them, they are just a thicker, more expensive version of curtain spring rods sold anywhere they sell curtain rods. I use these, but purchased curtain spring rods for the rest of the shelves in the RV that I wanted a cross bar to prevent shifting and falling."
2,Cheap-looking up close,These photograph well but are rather cheap-looking up close. For what I paid I expected better craftsmanship.
5,Excellent Translation,Oesterle's translation of this collection of disputed questions answered by Aquinas is highly readable and makes this text usefully accessible to scholars and students.
2,Not Bad for newbies,"If you're a newbies in hacking, this book cover almost everything but it's not in detail."
4,Amusing and informative.,"A great way of teaching some of the less enlightened about computer saftey some of the ins and outs. It has some wonderful information. One complaint: it doesn't really *tell* you how to certain things, just hints at how you could find out.Highly recommended."
1,A truly awful book!,"I'll say it again: This is truly an awful book. I'm returning it. The book was more of an advertisement for the metacrawler search engine than anything else. Otherwise, I would sum this book up by saying that it is nothing more than subversive tripe. Nothing like a good book to tell the target audience (teenagers) how to cheat in life."
1,BAD BAD BAD book,"BAAAD Book. This book is about how to hack computer. This guy, Wallace Wang, managed to write 340 pages and yet said nothing. This guy is either stingy, doesn't want to share his knowledge, or chicken, (I don't know why he so afraid of saying something useful.) This book is like a yellow page of website. Sometime he doesn't even tell you the exact website. He told you to go search the web. (Duh..) Example: how to prevent virus? He told you to buy antivirus software. How to buy software for cheap? He told you to copy software from friend. I learn nothing from this book. DONT buy this book. really BAD book. Don't buy this book. BAD. BAD. BAD. Book. Happy hacker is a little better."
1,a useless book,"Thier is no real useful information. The whole book is outdated now. Their was no real content, just a huge listing of websites that are not even their anymore."
3,Basic information,"It's not bad, it just too basic. For some reason I had the expectation that it would be a more deep book about hacking."
3,Ok Read,"A bit outdated already, but what book isn't trying to keep up with security systems etc. on todays computer systems. Stll, it has a lot of good reading about the hackers train of thought etc. Enough to still help to give you an edge against the ones using viruses etc. I'm waiting for the next edition!"
3,"Poor to the advanced, and scary to the new.","I believe that this book was poorly written, it has some good points and topics, but then he tottaly skips over the real important things."
4,"Informative, easy to follow, and well explained.","I enjoyed reading it, the advice was sound, and easy to follow. I expected it to be about what you eat for the best health, but it covers a lot more about the body and mental state."
2,Same info as before,There isn't anything new here unless you want to fall asleep reading about cheese and whisky. Dr. Weil gives examples of how some cheese's and whisky get better as they age as if this is supposed to correlate to people. I love Dr. Weil's other books and his website but I was disappointed by this book. If you want to read a good anti-aging book read Roy Walford's 120 year Diet. An excellent read.
3,same o same o,"This man is also a great writer and person to listen too and read, but after a while you are getting repeats in a different form. Good stuff, but after so many books, if you've read them, why buy more. If you never read his book, very good."
4,A nice read for the future,"I think I am not yet in this age range that the book wants to intend. But it is a fine read and I would definitely put this into consideration for the future. After all, you can even use this as early as you can so that when the time comes, your health will be better. Saw this nice book after readingHair Loss: Erase The Embrassmentin which is not yet applicable for me but still, a nice reference book for the future."
2,Healthy Aging,"Got this book ""Healthy Aging"" for my ex-husband, but don't know if he liked it or not or even read it, Sorry. I did not get to read it."
2,Too Technical,"Either Dr. Weil was trying to impress us with his vast knowledge of molecular biology or he honestly thought most readers would understand this stuff. If we armed ourselves with dictionaries, medical school textbooks and were willing to take volumnious amounts of notes, perhaps we would learn as much about the topic of aging as Dr. Weil labors to teach us. I'll never know because I not only became bored beyond belief after the first few chapters, but Dr. Weil's relentless message of, ""age is not fun but there is nothing you can do about it, so accept it...."" dragged me into despair at times. Depak Chopra, by contrast, is uplifting and hopeful in his message about the aging process. I am sorry I bought this book."
5,Live Shekinah Glory,"A true worship experience. Would recommend to anyone who wants a worship experience in their home, car and anywhere they desire."
3,Okay for the money...,"This is a somewhat better product than HoMedics Bath Spa Mat. Unfortunately, the water jet is not powerful enough. Even though it circulates enough water, but it's just no enough to be relaxing or have any kind of massage effect. One other thing, if you mount it on the side of your tub, you will get jet shoting at one side of your body, but have absolutely no affect on the other side. Perhaps, mounting at the end of the tub, where your feet are, might be a better idea. Also, for most of us that have a sliding door for the shower, this puppy is difficult to mount, it is not design with the consideration of sliding door guide rail."
2,it doesent do the job,"the print date is not legible, and it is realy small, better to buy a self ink one than this one"
3,Why?,"The Cure's new greatest hits CD covers their whole catalog, but I can't understand the reasoning behind this album. All this material is availiable on the other compilation cd's and in a more complete manor. The bonus disc of live acoustic stuff sounds awful, like a lounge act performing the music with no energy. Don't buy this CD to get the acoustic disc. I did and I wish I hadn't. Buy ""Staring at the Sea"" and ""Galore"" if you want all the greatest hits. I am really disapointed."
3,This Is Not The One To Get...,"Whether you're a new Cure fan or an old one looking for just the classic songs, then this CD might seem like a good idea. It's not. While it does have some classic songs on it, it doesn't flow very well and isn't a good introduction to The Cure. If you want a good strong collection of Cure titles then go with the singles collections ""Staring At The Sea"" and ""Galore"". Not only do they have most of the songs on this Greatest Hits CD, they have a better assortment of tunes that really captures the essence of The Cure's roller coaster ride through the gothic subculture and poppy dark mainstream. The Cure has such a varied sound from album to album, it's very hard to understand the transformation they (well, Robert Smith) went through. While this very well may be impossible, it's at least a better try with the two Singles CD's than with this ""Greatest Hits"" jibe.So, spend a little extra cash for the two CD's and it'll make your shiny little day."
3,eh...I'd pick up galore instead.,"greatest hits is a good collection but I think the cure's Galore had a better track listing. Why isn't fascination street on here? And nothing from Bloodflowers? yes you can say ""you fool! greatest hits has most the songs from galore anyway dork wadd!"" but galore gives you the pure cureness with out beating around the bush."
4,Highly Underated - Damn Good CD!,One of my favorite CD's. I just don't get the bad reviews. I suppose those people are the ones giving excellent reviews to the likes of Britney Spears and such.
5,The best album of 2004,"This album is the proof that Courtney Love is a real rock goddess. When Hole broke up I was sure I'd never have listened again to some good music. But I was wrong. She is growing up, and her music is growing up with her. America's Sweetheart is full of passion, rage, love, sadness like in the grunge years, but the feelings now are just more mature. You can sing and scream in your car while listening to All the Drugs, Hello, Mono or But Julian. But you can still cry when her voice touches your heart in songs like Uncool,Hold on to me,Sunset Strip or the beautiful Life Despite God. Thank you Courtney cause I swear to God I wasn't feeling so ALIVE since the Live Through This era."
4,"I find her repulsive, but like her music","I got to hand it for Love. Eventhough, she acts like a skank from hell, her music is pretty darn good.A few years back someone made me listen to Live Through This and I loved the damm thing. Then I bought Celebrity Skin and really liked that one too. When I heard she was coming out with another album I ran out and bought it (I hope I'm not supporting her drug habit.). AND I LIKE IT, especially the first four songs. I love Mono and Hold Onto Me especially.Why do I like her music? Well basically Female Rockers like Sheryl Crow, Chryssie Hyndes only have one speed - they're really not about rock music, but about hits and they rarely make me feel. Stevie Nicks can rock but rarely every does. She is too safe. Courtney ROCKS and I love the lyrics. She writes great songs about her lifestyle and she makes me feel. Frankly, the more I listen to her music, the more I like her. I THINK IT'S TIME FOR AN EXORCIST!!!!! UGGGGGG!!!!!!"
5,COURTNEY IS THE BEST!!!!,This new album is totally Courtney. It's one of the best I've heard in years. The songs are so pure and full of rock enery it's great. The album is just aweosome and so is the first single 'Mono.' Vote for Courtney being the best on everything because she is America's Sweetheart!
1,Warning: DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM,"I had signed up to receive courtneylove.com updates as to when the website was launching and the CD release, I even joined CL's Street Team to spread the word. Then one day I'd received an update telling me the album was available for listening and there was even a Sweetheart Player to listen to it on............Although I was a fan of Courtney Love in the past I have heard enough, America's Sweetheart was a big fat lie filled with empty lyrics ........Is she friends with Anna Nicole, maybe they should meet.......The plastic surgery looks really dumb and the drugs don't do any good for her character.Do Not waste your money, if you want to hear the freakshow do so for free on courtneylove.com otherwise there would be no other reason to listen to this pile of crap, unless of course you were a complete moron...."
1,Great Album!!!!,"I'm sure this album is about as worthless as Ms. Love herself. And, I don't know what the hell reviewer Je77 is talking about, but just because someone says ""Oi"" or ""Hey"" or ""Shut Up"" several times on an album, does NOT mean that it's automatically a ""punk"" album!!! But, I guess that reviewer was pretty busy listening to Good Charlotte or some horrible band like that, so who can blame her/him!!! Don't waste your money on garbage like this....."
3,MONO A GREAT SONG THE REST IS IFFY,"I was disappointed when I skipped school to rush out for Courtney's c.d and found it to be half hearted and without attitude. Punk rock/Grunge is virtually dead these days. I was hoping for the queen herself to keep her crown however, I believe that the title may be passed unto Ms. Dalle. The unfortunate thing is that I don't believe that the future generation will be able to appreciate or be inspired by Ms. Love or her music. R.I.P HOLE."
5,LOVE ROCKS,"Courtney Love is the most powerful female rocker. This album kicks so much ass, theres so much passion and aggression at the same time. The best track in my opinion is 'Almost Golden' and the end of 'Sunset Strip' where she screams passionatly for almost mintue. 'Life Despite God' is also one of the better songs, its a messed up love song of someone whos tired and sick of it. Courtney is a true goddess."
3,Not bad but not great either!,"I believe Courtney's best album to date is Live through this. Celebrity skin fell short in a way and pretty on the inside.....MEH.Ok so now America's sweetheart is what I'd call just an average album that truly rocks to some degree. Some great songs on the album are But Julian I'm A Little Bit Older Than You, Almost Golden, Life Despite God, and Zeplin Song.The album does fall short in a lot of ways but the songs I mentioned above keeps it consistently good.I would say this is more for the hardcore Hole fans who have waited years for new material."
1,"COURTNEY, YOU'RE 15 MINUTES ARE UP.....","I will admit that when Hole first burst on the musicallandscape, they caught my attention. ""Live Through This""had some great moments. But come on, this woman is pushing40, and has the point of view of a self-obsessed teenager.When you think about it, all Courtney really has now (besidesa freakish desire for the spotlight) is an ""image"" and avery little bit of real talent. Screaming and caterwaulingare fine if there's some substance to back it up, but thisis just empty posing. It's silly! Mrs. Cobain, it's timeto grow up!"
4,Courtney without a Hole in her heart...,"Courtney Love is either loved or hated. And I happen to be on the love side. I mean, sure she is wild and out of control, but what rock star isn't? Her passion is what draws her to most of her fans and pulls her away from her critics.Anyways, Courtney takes on the music world without Hole this time. And sadly, it is not up to par with anything that Hole has released, but it is still a good record. It is a total depature from 1998's Celebrity Skin, and goes back to some much punkier tunes.Courtney's voice is very strange on this album though. It's scratchy but doesn't really have that nice soft tone to it, so that's one of my complaints. Also the first half of the CD is very superior to the last half. On the first half there is the punky ""Mono"" and ""Sunset Strip"" which are the two best on the album.Just get this CD if you are a Hole/punk rock fan and you have a certain taste to riot grrl rock."
5,"Oh yeah, Mama is SO back...","Courtney Love has done what so many did not expect - She has made a brilliant, brilliant album. If you think you have heard a raspy, wailing Courtney before, think again...Her sound is all whiskey and unfiltered cigarettes...A modern day Janis.If you want a real punk-rock chick (as opposed to a branded one...uhm, Pink, anyone?)America's Sweethard is the real deal. Crafted, raw songs, plenty melody, plenty dysfunction...I love this album!"
4,"Welcome back, Courtney","Thank the stars above that Courtney is still gracing us with her talent! Next time, don't stay away so long."
5,Excellent book on two sizzling topics - BEST pick...,"This is an excellent source of information/tutorial/reference for two sizzling topics of ALE & EDI. Rajeev brings a wealth of knowledge to the reader by offering some superb practical advise and tips & tricks for efficient implementation of these interface technologies. Furthermore, the CDROM has some very valuable source code and reference material. And by the way, this book is real value for money.I completely disagree with the previous reader's comments, who is just being a jerk about this book and perhaps does not know to appreciate a great book when he sees one. This book is anyday better than the other book by Arvind Nagpal which is just THICK and nothing else."
1,Real disparity in ratings should tell you something!!,Another useless book that serves to waste only your time and money. We do not have time to waste in this business. Need more HONEST reviews.
1,Written with a very myopic vision....useless book,After reading all the comments I felt it will be a great book to have but I was very disappointed after reading the book. The material covered in the book is merely couple of tutorials and no real coverage of the concepts and business problems we face in the real world. The last one third portion of the book is a dump from SAP tables which is merely couple of keystrokes away in SAP. I must credit the author for the fine prints at the bottom saying that it is a dump of SAP tables directly. I would not recommend this book at all.....waste of time and money. Most of what is covered in the book is nicely documented in the QUICKSTART guide of SAP online help. Don't keep your hopes high of learning the concepts about ALE or EDI from this book written with a myopic vision.
1,not worth buying at all,This book is not worth buying at all. the author cleverly uses buzz words and selling tactics that try to make the book look good. I would shop for other SAP books. Dont waste your money on this one.
3,Fun for a Lord of the Rings Fan--Not So Fun If You Actually Want to Play Backgammon,"I receivedUSAopoly Lord of the Rings Backgammonas a gift. Because I like both backgammon and LOTR, this should have been a perfect present. However, the game concept wasn't implemented well in practice.The pieces are gold and silver, so they turn out to be a little difficult to distinguish from one another. Alas, it has ended up as a cool novelty item (hence the three stars), but not something I use anymore.If that wasn't bad enough, the wood case has developed a crack. Poor materials are to blame for that :("
3,Facinating but overpriced.,"The book is poorly titled, it should be ""Web Client Programming with Perl and LWP"".If you take out the endless and repeated perl listings, and quite childish introductions, that are also repeated, the book shrinks to half it's size.However taking these to facts into account, what's left is both facinating and enlightening, but not worth the $30 list price. I'm glad I got via Amazon at a discount!"
3,Too shallow.,"I personally found this book much less informative than I was hoping.Most of the book is dedicated to explaining the ins and outs of HTTP. There is not enough sample code, and the code that is given is pretty basic.As far as information about programming web clients with perl, I have found that it is more helpful to just do web seraches, and read the examples available on various web sites.The book does do a good job of explaining HTTP and the how web clients operate. I just wish there had been more information about Perl clients specifically.I wouldn't pay [as much] for this book. Look for it used, it's not hard to find."
3,Bubble Spa Bath Mat w/ Remote,"After reading all the reviews I was alittle wary on buying the product, but after months I bought it anyways. I had no problems with the suctions cups sticking (I got the tub wet first and step all over the mat to ensure suction before starting the bath). Although I agree they should have provided bigger suction cups. The motor is pretty loud, especially on high or during the program - my husband stated we should have just reversed our vaccum. However being such a large motor, it did produce alot of bubbles. Our heat option felt pretty cool, maybe I didn't leave it on long enough to warm up. The cleaning process was a piece of cake - I don't really understand all the complaints. All in all, I'm glad I got it -- it makes a decent jacuzzi bath for those who don't have one."
1,What a dissappointment....,"I was so happy to get our bubble spa! It was not out of the box 15 minutes, before we had to give it a try. As with the other reviews, it does not stick to your tub. Thought it was maybe my type of tub, but I see not. The clean up of the unit does take away from it's ability to relax, as stated by another reviewers. A great idea. But has a very long way to go. I will not return it...... but would not recommend it with it's present design."
1,Never received book. Almost flunked class.,Made two attempts to contact seller. Never answered me. Never received book. Now must wait the two weeks to get reimbursed by Amazon.
1,Don't be tempted,"It looks great in theory, but the reality is much different. Don't waste your money. This product does not do what the manufacturer claims that it does. It produces a very minimal illumination which does not last. Save your money. Don't buy it."
1,Booooo,"Cute but for $30.00 its a real disappointment, does not light up I have had it in full sun no glow..Boooo"
3,HAD FOR FIVE YEARS,"I have had one of these in my back yard for five years. It is lovely to look at; however, it has Never Ever illuminated. I kept it because it is pretty and looks nice.So, it is nice to look at, but does not, and has not, ever functioned as an illuninarie. I guess they have sold millions of these to people ""in the hopes"" that theirs' will be the one that functions. I would not hope, I would just buy it because it is pretty, then you shall not be disappointed.Mine has held up well and I expect it to stand there, looking pretty, for another, 5 or 10 years. Quite sturdy! And quite pretty! But it does not shine!"
2,Not what I expected,"I bought several Echo Valley products because I liked the look of them and thought they would be fun additions to my garden. I understood that they were not solar powered lights and that they just had luminarie paint on glass, but I thought the glow-in-the-dark look would be different from the solar powered lights I already have. I put them in one of my gardens that gets full sun for at least eight hours a day. And yet, even with full sun on the most glorious of days, at night there is nothing. You have to get right up on top of them to even notice that there is something there trying to glow. I will not be buying anymore Echo Valley products and I am sorry for the ones I did purchase. For the price, they are certainly a rip-off. Do not waste your money!"
3,Echo Valley Illuminarie Moon Stake,"It is pretty and where it is placed in my garden, you can't see the imperfections, but I don't think it was worth the money. It doesn't glow at all and it's put together poorly...you can see globs of glue on the seams."
4,The best book on ABS,"The book starts with the theoretical foudation, myths, facts, body basics, and nutrition. Brungardt provides the reader with interesting insights (e.g. mixture of protein / carbohydrats). The exercises are all very well illustrated and ranked according to its difficulty level from 1 to 3. The ambituous reader will find top excercises which he can use in a well written 6 week programme. Stated are excercises, day, reps, and rest. Easy to follow, hard to do..."
2,Aggressive shred techniques?,"I thought the title aggressive shred techniques was kind of misleading. I mean, he shows some nice warm up scales and speed licks. But the rest of the DVD is just about his equipment. Plus, the cover reads: ""Free ghs strings inside"", where were they? Not in my case.Don't get me wrong he is a good guitarist. He is fast and has his pedals and his tremolo skills down. But again, ""aggressive shred techniques""? I didn't see any of that.Maybe good for learning, but not inspirational for shredding. Sorry."
5,Simple and Straightforward Recipes for Success.,"This book is a must read for anyone who wants simple strategies for succeeding in business. The advice coupled with the anecdotes makes it fun, insightful and engaging. This is truly the stuff that has been key to the success of Microsoft and is just as applicable to other businesses"
1,Bought it for my wife and it has become a paper weight,I bought this for my aroma-therapy and natural sounds addicted wife. It is a now a paper-weight. the sounds are not very natural and the smells are well...smelly.
2,Too noisy and not enough scent,"I ordered this after reading the reviews here on Amazon. I was truly disappointed at the quality of this product. The ""sounds"" sound like they are coming over a cell phone - a lot of static noise rather than sounding like nature. The scents are very mild and you need to be on top of the machine to smell anything. This is not my idea of an aromatherapy experience. Would not recommend this to anyone."
3,Dorm fun.,"This is a nice way to keep a small room smelling pleasant, even if you don't subscribe to the whole aromatherapy thing. The sound generator is just marginal, with some sounds less than relaxing and the lack of a functional volume control a problem.I think scented candles and an environmental CD that you like would be better, though as a package deal and at this price, it's not too shabby."
1,not a good device,Bought one and returned it as there was an intermittent beeping noise. Received the second one only to discover the same problem.
2,nice while it lasted,"First, you can run it longer than 60 minutes - just dont choose one of those buttons. I really liked this machine - for my baby and my husband sleeping days. I just took it on vacation with me, used it one night, the next night it wouldnt work again. Apparently I am past the time limit to return it (we have only been using it for a few weeks). I would like to buy a new one..."
2,Worked well.. BUT short life,We bought this for our 2 baby boys. It worked well for about 6 months but the buttons are now jamming up and the sound is very faint. It was nice while it worked but not worth it for the long haul. I guess you get what you pay for.
4,Nice and Relaxing....,What a great buy! I absolutely love this product! I love how it has the soothing sounds AND the aromatherapy combined- I used it at work as soon as I got it and it really is relaxing. I plan to buy one for my apartment too! I totally recommend it!
2,close to a 2.5,Mint Condition in terms of Playing ability is very Versatile. they play a wide range of styles&cover many sounds&Hybrids. but the one thing that has always kinda dogged them is that there Songwriiting hasn't always matched there instrumentation chops&that is the case here.vocally it's hit&Miss. I've always dug there Music but I always was hoping for that next step album.just because oyu play Live Instrumentation doesn't mean you are gonna make classic material.I feel something is missing with this Project.still it's cool having these Brothers back.they still are tight Live.
5,GLAD THAT THEY ARE BACK!!!,"I have not finished listening to the entire cd yet (as a matter of fact, I'm listening to it now as I am writing this review) I AM LOVING IT!!!!!!!!! (only up to track 5 ""I'm Ready"")Real musicians, song writers, lyricists and performers are what Mint Condition is made of.....VERY NICE, GUYS!! KEEP IT UP!!!!"
2,Niko for deaf people,The sound went out after a few months. The remote is of poor quality and you have to press the power button repeatedly to turn or off. Picture notoo bad and sound wasn't too bad while it worked.But you don't expect the sound to go so soon.
5,Great Choice,"I have taken shots outdoor as well as indoor with this camera. The picture quality often compares that from my DSLR when I am shooting outdoors. The colors are saturated and edges are sharp.I also think that this camera gives the best quality for indoor shots from a P&S.; You can safely shoot at ISO 800 and with a little photoshop noise reduction, the pictures are perfectly usable."
3,Average but with a talent.,"Good, BUT not the overall quality and feeling of my Canon point-and-shoot cameras. The skin tone for indoor shots is not so 'natural' in automatic mode. No burst mode at all: even if there is a function for it, it takes seconds to get the second frame. But this Fuji has a special talent: ISO 400 shots ARE noise-free. This comes at the cost of a visible digital processing of the image, but with a downscaling to 2000 lines, the picture is still full of details and without any appreciable noise. ISO settings up to 1600 are usable indeed. Thanks to this, it outperforms other cameras in low light situations and can be well spent as 'specialist' camera."
1,still hungry,"This was a disappointing book to me. I was excited to think I had found a book that would help me build a diet of items that were 'safe' to eat. This book, however, gave the typical lists of what not to eat. It is also pretty confusing because one page will list good foods to eat, for example, that are high in magnesium but includes standard trigger foods such as chocolate and nuts that are noted on other pages as being possible problems. It is like the author just copied the list from somewhere and didn't even bother to note which items are thought to be triggers for migraines. The book also has, in my opinion, a too light-hearted feel to it. I was hoping for some solid advice on what to eat in a no-nonsense tone...but didn't find here unfortunately. Maybe I would like the book better if I tried a few of the 21 recipes. I was just hoping for more than a ""Peachy Cake"" (one of the 21 recipes) book."
1,great if you can use them,did not provide vacum hose or attachment to be used with hand held vacuum pump that's all I have to say.
1,VERY POOR PRODUCT,"I've tried several of these Foodsaver canisters, and most have cracked quite soon after being put into use. One crack, and they are no longer air-tight. The round ccanisters crack on the bottom. Rectangular canisters crack along all four corners. Don't waste your money. Also, they're real space-eaters in the cabinets. the lids don't nest at all, and neither do the canisters of the same size."
2,FoodSaver Canisters,"Great product, works like it says it does but they are too small. My wife wanted to use them as storage canisters for flour, sugar, brown sugar and so on but they were too small. Biggest one can't even hold a 5 pound bag of flour. It's cool to have the capability of vacuum storage containers but I wish they could be larger."
1,Crack Kills!,"If you only believe one review this year, make it this one! Should get 0 stars.Bought a set of these canisters 5 years ago when the color was a dark smokey brown, and they were fabulous. Since then foodsaver has either changed the type of plastic or the wall thickness as the new clearer color ones all develop pressure cracking on the bottom!!! Returned for another set that did the same thing. Lousy customer service charges shipping that is half the price of the product! Why won't they fix this issue? Look at ALL the bad reviews with cracking. Just reinforce the bottom with molded ribs or find a new plastic! Actually, for the price they should be Lexan. In the garbage now! Don't waste your money!!!"
1,Can't keep a seal,"We love our FoodSaver, and use it daily with the plastic bags and especially mason jars for long term storage. But I needed something larger for storing grain and other staples.So I had high hopes for these things (and paid a good deal more for them than the price given here). Even new, every one of them has failed to keep it's seal over the long term. I filled one with brown sugar -- I might as well have left it out in the open, it's now rock hard."
1,Great if you want to waste food & $,Definitely a waste of money because they are not reliable. A product that cannot be relied on to function and perform as advertised is not worth the Chinese junk it is made of. You cant tell by looking at them if they are holding their seal ( which half the time they do NOT)so you find that out when you go to open them and find your food is spoiled or stale. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE OR THIER SEALER EITHER.
1,Zero stars! But I love the idea...,"I purchased FoodSaver canisters in a store in various sizes. Every one of them ""spider web"" cracked on the bottom in one or two uses. I give credit to Tilia. They replaced every canister. And every one of the replacements cracked in one or two uses. Now I use them without vacuum for sugar, flour, etc. FYI... I hand washed them so it is not dishwasher caused as one service rep suggested.I love the idea of these canisters and I too wish Tilia would find materials that work."
1,Very Disappointed,"I have bought numerous FoodSaver Containers over the years, and they continue to fail. Put them away and when you pull them out, the lid pops off and you have food product all over the floor/cupboard/etc. After a long day of baking/cooking for the holidays, I spilled food all over the cupboard and floor as the lid popped off yet again. I was so angry I filled out a complaint form and sent it to FoodSaver.com. Today I received an email from their customer service dept. saying ""Sorry for the inconvenience. Let us know if you have any other feedback"". OK, then. I guess I will just use the bags, as I do have good luck with them."
2,Worked for a while and then cracked,Had these for a couple of years. Treated them with care. Large container Cracked. The only answer I got from Customer Service was the Auto Reply of --we received your email and will reply within 48 hours. Am still waiting. Really liked the canisters- until they cracked. Will not spend money to replace them.
1,"Wow, it really does crack immediately!","I thought that perhaps other reviewers were abusing their canisters, but I was moved to write this review after hearing ""crackcrackCRACK"" from the bottom of my brand new 1 1/2 quart FoodSaver canister during its second use. These are far too expensive to use one time and then throw away or recycle. I'll be strictly using the bags from now on."
4,Had mine for 5 years now...no cracks,"My canisters outlasted my sealer!!(have @ 10 and just order more) Just bought a new sealer (FoodSaver V2840) The only advice I can give is never put into dishwasher(that is the only one I had develop cracks) I use mine EVERY day, store coffee in it and reseal for storage with no issues...."
5,Outstanding. Highly Recommended,"I am not an avid reader of ""fiction"" and typically quit reading these books after a few chapters as they soon strike me as unbelievable. I especially avoid so called ""psychological thrillers"" and in particular those dealing with serial killers --and in part that has to do with a period of my career when, as an expert in the neurosciences, I had dealings with such individuals, including stalkers, serial rapists, murderers, the criminally insane etc. This book surprised me. I loved it. It was incredibly believable. The plot terrific. The characters deep and complex. This is an outstanding ""psychological thriller."" I highly recommend it."
3,unplanned unexplained mystery,"The plot of the book can be seen in previous reviews. I did enjoy the book, up until the end. The stalker is not identified, how did he get all the info on Kate, how did he get the private number backstage. This part of the book left holes in the entire story, unexplained, unbelievable. I expected more of Hunter. All his other books I've read have been mostly plausible, understandable. But this? Bad ending from this aspect."
3,The Wheels are still turnin,"Wheels are Turnin was Reo's most popular album to follow Hi Infidelity. Reo struck it big again with another huge power ballad Can't fight this feeling(still gets played at high school dances). Not some of Reo's best writing, but I dowanna know, and one lonely night are also highlights. If you're a big fan check out the Wheels are Turnin' concert video."
4,One of the best album's REO has done to date.,I donot understan how anybody can down rate an album so great. It's one of the best REO has done ans was surprised at the low star pointage rate on the album. Can't wait to hear more from the band. always a fan. Princess
1,"Verizon's ""broad""band extremly slow","I've own a Verizon data card for over a year now and the connection speed is becoming extremely slow. I tested everywhere including in house, on the road, airport etc. The avg download is about 400K and upload 140K. These are significantly slower than what I was promised at the store and the results of my tests when I first bought it (800K/400K).I called Verizon. The tech support guy was very rude and basically said this speed is normal and ""broadband"". He also tried to come up with excuses such as you are indoor although he had to agree that my signal strength was good. He also said as long as you could connect, you couldn't argue because there was no promise of the speed on the contract. (So basically even if your speed was 1K, they wouldn't see a problem with it.)My conclusion, I will never use Verizon again."
4,"Great music, but...","Its a great record of the concerts in Dublin, but to get five stars, the DVD should have included full setlist from the three conserts and better presentations of the musicians in stead of just their names. Nothing wrong with the music and the camera work, though - it sounds great and theres a very good band feeling over the consert. The old Springsteen classics Atlantic City and Highway Patrolman seems to be made for this setting!"
3,"Interesting, but...","The sessions band and Springsteen cover some of Bruce's older material recast into the old-timey style of his latest album, and surprisingly, siome of it works very well. The material that is actually folk stuff is of course done well, but a little goes a long way for fans of the Boss.The Blu-Ray is a disappointment however. It is hard to qualify the video as being good for even a standard DVD, much less a Hi-Def offreing, with muddy blacks and grainy soft images throughout. The sound is flat and compressed, and the oom sound a little too up in the mix."
1,Bruce.....Live,"This is one of the hopeless concert ever seen on the bluray.Pls dont buy it,waist of money....If ur Bruce fans better go for Live at Bercelona....Ryan Vaz."
3,Mesmirizing the little lady,"I found this at our public library and borrowed it because it looked cute. I didn't have exceedingly high expectations because many kids' videos have tendancies towards sub-par production quality. Kidsongs - I Can Sing Baby Animal Songs didn't disappoint my little lady.I'd recommend you borrow before you buy (if you can), but either way you're probably going to get exactly what you expect from a Kidsongs DVD. It's cute, it's silly, it's bright and colorful both visually and in song. It's not knock-your-socks-off great, but the little lady hardly blinks when it's on, and that's the tot's true enjoyment litmus test."
4,She loves this,"my daughter loves this dvd... she has another Kids songs and while the kids in it to my older children ""look so fake"" my 3 yr old loves it and sings and dances to it and after all she is who it was bought for so her reaction is what counts... I will probably order her at least one of the others... don't think I would get all available though I like to give her variety"
3,"The packaging sucks because it causes latex to sweat, which means....","....I have to do some alterations. The manufacturer should not have placed this head piece in a plastic bag, folded up. Some of the paint came off of the snakes when i took it out of the bag and one of the snakes at the base was pulling apart at the seam. So I need a little glue to fix that. Even the position of the tongues of the snakes were placed wrong, they were barely attached at the tip of lip. I have a small head so, the head piece fits perfectly, don't recommend for large heads. The idea of the head piece is great, so I'm keeping it. If you are not creative then you definitely don't want to get this. I like crafts so it works for me."
5,Blues At It's Best,"Why do we always lose the best in this world. Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Johnny Copeland, Luther Allison and Doug Maynard. While Doug was mainly a singer and his style was unlike the others his music was just as great. I saw him perform back in the '70s and will never forget the experience. I still own an album by Doug and also treasure this CD and another live CD of his material. Maynard had a mesmerizing voice that one could listen to forever. A song of his not on this CD that echoes his greatness as a vocalist is Lullaby not found here but the title song, Rave On and Blue Devon do his voice justice. Buy this CD before it is out of print."
1,"Terrible plot, script and acting",First movie I've ever turned off half way through. The writing was terrible and not once did it make me giggle. Go for something else.
4,"5 good shorts, 2 weak shorts","This one a good DVD. ""Grips, Grunts, And Groans"" is in my top 5 favorite stooge shorts because it is fast-paced, manic, and Curly going crazy is hilarious! ""All The World's A Stooge"", ""3 Dumb Clucks"", ""Three Little Pirates"", and ""Uncivil Warbirds"" are great shorts too. ""Back To The Woods"" and ""Violent Is The Word For Curly"" are on the weak side. This is still a good DVD for any stooge fan. The quality on ""Three Little Pirates"" is not so good."
3,Pretty good.,"This is a pretty good DVD. GRIPS, GRUNTS, AND GROANS and ALL THE WORLD'S A STOOGE are okay shorts, I guess. THREE DUMB CLUCKS is great. Curly does an interesting performance playing himself and the Stooges' father. Remade with Shemp as UP IN DAISY'S PENTHOUSE. THREE LITTLE PIRATES is a great short. Curly gives his last great performance with the Maha-Aha routine. UNCIVIL WARBIRDS is a pretty good short, with another one of Curly's last great performances. BACK TO THE WOODS was very weak and boring, however. Too slow and uninteresting. VIOLENT IS THE WORD FOR CURLY is a great short. The ""Swingin' the Alphabet"" song is classic. This DVD is good enough to purchase. I'd buy it if I were you."
5,Cool Tweety Hitch Cover,Item came in good time just as advertised. Looks very cool on the hitch of my S10 pick up.
5,This is the funniest DVD Ever!,"I must say that I was reserved when I bought this DVD, but the concept and ideas behind the DVD are truly awesome and very entertaining! I strongly suggest buying this DVD if you want a good laugh and some surprising information about the banking industry! Im glad this DVD is there to teach people how to make money on their home while screwing the bank at the same time! Keep up the good work!!!"
4,This is THE version to own,"This version comes with Fingers and Centerfold, two songs that i heard on other versions of this cd but never found on the same disc. i swore that i would only purchase it when those two tracks were on the same disc. and lo and behold!!!! This came a long. A great album from Pink. lots of sass and great catchy melodies. especially worth the purchase for the stellar bonus tracks."
1,It's Only More Crap,"You cant call this ""music"".For comfort the people call this ""music"", but in fact is only an aproximation, the composition and creativity of the songs are very poor.So what is the music? where i find it?. Well if you wanna learn about music listen Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Hendrix, Weather Report, Clapton, Tribal Tech, JEFF BECK, Paco De Lucia, Miles Davis. Remember, all the types of music or almost all are good rock, blues, funk, hard rock, pop, flamenco, tango, bossa nova, fusion.The problem not is the genre, the problem is the artist."
5,She's not dead!,"That's right, P!nk is not dead, she's even back for more ! I'm so glad she released that CD, it's her greatest so far. There's a bit of everything on that album: pop, rock, r&b;, a little bit of jazz and blues, slow songs. It's a must-have for everyone.My favorite songs are: Stupid Girls, Who Knew and Dr Mr President. But I enjoy listening to every song. Support our girl !"
4,Pink is Back,This I have to say is one of her best CD I have lister to for while. When she be out her first singal it was ok but when I say the video to U & UR hand I like it and side this might be a good CD after all. So if you like rock Pink get this CD it is really good.
4,I Like It!,Pretty Good Pink! My favorite's on the Album areLeave Me Alone (Im Lonely)Dear Mr PresidentRunawayWho KnewThere are all 5 star songs however some of the songs are not so great! But overall I like it pretty good!!
4,"Would have given 5 stars, but can't load it into iTunes","Love the music, but I can't load it into iTunes or play it on my computer."
4,Cuz She Can,"Pink takes no prisoners on this cd. Shes raw, edgy, emotional, and blunt, even more so than usual on certain songs. All the songs are good and some of them make you think and take you to a deep place. I love ""Dear Mr President"", she spoke the absolute truth about Bush, something alot of people are scared to do. She didn't bite her tongue, she just stuck it to him straight Pink style. My favorite song would have to be, ""Nobody Knows"". Her vocals are nice and you can really hear and feel her emotion throughout the song. This is definitely something that music lovers everywhere should own but only if you can handle the edge. This was a huge improvement from the ""Try This"" cd."
4,In the P!nk,"After ""Missundaztood"", ""Try This"" was a dissappointment. It's good to hear P!nk return to what made me interested in her music in the first place...irreverant, honest lyrics backed by pop/dance sound and a powerful unapologetic voice.""I'm Not Dead"" is perhaps P!nk's best album so far, and it's clear that her confidence has grown along with her song-writing and vocal ability.Hits: Clearly ""Stupid Girls"", and the radio friendly ""Who Knew"", possibly (with edits) ""Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely)"" and ""U + Ur Hand"".Misses: The self-indulgent ""Conversations With My 13-Year Old Self"", throwaway ""I Got Money Now"", and ""The One That Got Away"" (note to P!nk - leave Janis to Janis - you're good, but not that good).Overall a very enjoyable album."
2,too serious,I think its better when Pink isn't so serious like in stupid girls.but some of these songs don't seem like she is having much fun and the very last song which is an anti-war protest with her dad is a bit boring and trite for my tastes.
1,Pink eh...,I'm Not Dead? Darn that's too bad. This is the worst album from Pink in recent years. Her edgy ways aren't going to appeal to anyone besides those who like to hate pop music.
2,Her career is on the ropes,"I like the subject matter she goes after,but the problem is to me she just ain't convincing of a All-around artist to make it work. to me she is one more Brick from being almost forgotten. in truth for that she claims to not stand for She is more closer to it. I think Pink would be a good fit in the Black Eyed peas because Pink has a Commerical 6th sense,but doesn't always get the results fully out there. Pink is trying to be a Cross Between Pat Benetar with a Bette Midler sass,but Pink also has a Britney spears pop vibe that is obvious.this album is aight.I think Pink is a workable vocalist who has some interesting subject matter like the song with her dad,but when She is talking about other chicks&what they do within the context of there career&then seeing the way Pink's own musical stylings are I just don't bite it. dime a dozen."
3,A decent re-issue,"Pink's Re-issue of ""I'm not dead"" is a decent re-issue. It's great that she added some songs which were on the international editions of the album. I always thought ""fingers"" was on the best album tracks and it didn't make the US edition, until now with this re-issue. I was expecting Zomba Label Group to make this a clean album like they did with Justin Timberlake'sFuturesex/Lovesounds - Deluxe Edition. I'm glad they didn't. And The DVD is a lot better than the dvd side of theoriginal Dual Disc version. But still, I find that if you own the original, this is a total waste of money.My Top 5 songs off the album1. Fingers2.Stupid Girls3. Heartbreaker4.Dear Mr. President5.Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely)"
5,Mosquito Magnet Replacement parts,the Mosquito Magnet is the greatest outdoor invention ever. N ow we can sit by the pool without being eaten alive. The replacement parts were delivered on time and fit perfectly
4,A Daily Requirement,Laxatone is a daily must for my seventeen year old friend(my cat). This is a wonderful aid in assisting him with his bowel movements. Would not be without it in my home and always have a spare on hand.
2,Flavor ok lots of husks,The flavor is good and it is not so heavy with the fake and greasy butter sludge. It does have a huge amount of un-popped husks. We will order a different type next time.
5,The Best,"This is the first and only Merle Haggard album I have ever owned and I never get tired of listening to it! Every single song on it is great. Listen to it a couple of times and you are hooked! Truly worth buying. I too am of the younger generation that truly appreciates the old country singers such as George Jones, Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash, etc. This stuff is good!"
4,excellent,"I have heard Twink described as an egomaniac and though I never knew him, this album is assuredly by a guy with a healthy if not more sense of self.Which works just fine. This is big gothic music in the spirit of expansive psychedelia. Lots of huge drums, large arrangements and a gaggle of voices to match. I guess if you are going to journey to the center of the music unknown, self-doubt is not a favorable attribute.Big ego, big music, big album. Do a big mouse click."
5,I Still Miss Morse but Lewis Fills the Void Very Well,"In my opinion nobody does mystery and crime better than the British. Lewis is right up there with the best of them: Lynley, Havers, Wexler, Morse, Daziel & Pasco, etc, etc. etc. Lewis and Hathaway are a thoroughly enjoyable and a less acerbic team than were Inspector Morse and the then Sergeant Lewis but the stories are intelligent and almost as twisty as they were in Morse's day. I enjoy the compassion and humor between Lewis and Hathaway and the two make a good team. I look forward to every episode and hope the series continues for a long time to come."
5,Perfection!,"Excellent as always! Love Lewis! ""LIfe Born of Fire"" was heartbreaking and beautiful. Getting a glimpse into Hathaway's past and understanding part of why he left the priesthood made this episode one of my personal favorites of the entire series."
2,Formerly the best outfit on earth or how Carly wrecked HP,A puff piece book about Carly. Avoid. She has been a disaster at HP and left Lucent just before it all came crashing down. Try the other book about Carly. Learn how a former dial tone sales person wrecked one of the greatest companies in American history.I am not an HP employee just an ex-customer.
3,going home again,"this is a made for tv movie,but not that bad at all.angel returns to help others in town.sure it's been done before,but it sure beats many i've seen."
3,Earth Angel,This is an okay movie. Why okay? I watched it and I can't remember what it was all about. It looked good but it wasn't a classic movie to watch over and over again.
2,Goes for style over substance,"I have no doubt that Hoff makes wonderful presentations, but he's written the book as though he's making a presentation. The techniques of effective writing are very different from those of effective speaking. Hoff takes pages and pages to make even the simplest point, something that could have been communicated in three sentences perfectly well. He can't simply just come out and state a something and be content with the fact that he's just shared something extremely useful. He comes off as trying to entertain more than inform. If you're making a presentation to high school students, maybe that's a good idea. But after 50 pages in a book, it starts to feel incredibly condescending. If you want a book that assumes you're reasonably intelligent, don't buy this one."
4,GOOD BUT ..............,"I would like to recommend for all those interested to also read :"" TITANIC "" a survivor's story written by one of the survivors by the name of "" Colonel Archibald Gracie "" who, gave his story plus went to the trouble of interviewing others who had survived PLUS, he went to almost all the hearings and wrote the transcriptions of testimony as well. Sadly this man died 4th of Dec. 1912 after doing his full duty for history . Thank God for this book as I have read many accounts including this one on here ...also, I would recommend "" Sinking Of the Titanic Eyewitness Accounts "" by many who survived w/some photos and sketches ."
2,"Interesting, but long and drawn out","I'm very interested in the Titanic, and have read several books about the events surronding this disaster. This book was interesting, but very very long and drawn out. Sometimes I was so bored reading it that I fell asleep. Particulary, I didn't care to know what every single person inside of every single lifeboat did, said, didn't do or didn't say, etc. But, like I said before, there was some interesting info. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone nor will I ever read it again."
5,The best book ever written on the Titanic disaster,"Vivid, chilling, extremely well written accounts of the Titanic disaster from passengers who survived. As if Joseph Conrad had been on board and lived to tell the tale. No hype. No melodrama. Just several horrific, suspenseful accounts from a few of the officers who remained until the bitter end. I started reading this book one night and couldn't put it down until 6 in the morning."
3,Quite disappointing,"I agree with the reviewer under me - this was a disappointment. Like he said, ""Sygyzy"" is the strongest track (actually a very good track) with much of the rest being mostly quite anonymous filler stuff. I read several good reviews of this album, praising it highly, but it clearly didn't do it for me. I doubt if I will ever order another David Wright CD, because there are so many other talented artists in this genre."
1,too experimental,I ordered this CD because of the review saying that the music was comparable with Enigma. I was very disappointed to hear the first songs on the CD. Dreary and too experimental and not the same as Enigma at all ! Ecxept of some songs (like Sygyzy) the music is not easy to listen to. A pity for the money...
5,For Marvin,"A friend mentioned he couldn't find a PEACE sign belt buckle. So, I found this one on line and made my good friend happy."
4,"Great punch, but still a lot of low end","I love this head! I had a Remo EMAD on before, and even with the dampening ring on there, I had to use a towel inside. Not so any more. I've got it tuned just tight enough to give me some feedback, and it sounds incredible. Lots of loud, big, low end but not so much boom that it overwhelms the initial punch. I would recommend this to anyone playing live.My only complaint is that I got sent a slightly warped head; it probably sat in a UPS truck for a while before getting to me."
4,No hassle foot endulgence for under $20!!!,"I got this item because although I enjoy the water foot massage units, who wants to do all that work when you come home from a long day on your feet?! So I decided on this one. I love it!! The vibrations relax your feet, and it requires no work and no clean up like the water versions. Only negative is the infared lights could be hotter. They do not provide much heat. But all in all for something under $20, with no work, it keeps my feet happy!"
3,I'd rather stick my feet in a bucket of hot Jello,"For the price, this product isn't that bad, but don't expect too much from it. The ""massage"" basically amounts to it vibrating a lot, which can feel somewhat nice, but not as much as I had expected. As a runner, I've tried many different foot massagers and this one is on the slightly below average end. The unit also doesn't put off much heat at all. You can get more heat from sticking your feet near a light bulb.However, being able to control the product with my toes was fairly nice, and I do use it occasionally. I just don't think it should have been labeled as a""Pro Ultra."" There's nothing really ""ultra"" about it."
3,Don't expect something great!!,I find the HoMedics Ak-3 Foot Massager is worth the sale price. Not a big bang for the buck. I agree with other reviewers that the motor is undersized. If you put much weight on it it slows way down. If you want something to really massage your feet go with a product that had rollers or kneaders. Which by the way cost alot more money.
3,Great Messager but turns off too fast,"This is great when you come home for a long day of work to sit down and relax. But the major problem is that it automatically turns off after 45 minutes and you need to wait about 7-10 minutes before the messager returns to its normal operation. I was expecting more from a $30 messager. This is a great product if you don't mind a quick message, but unfortunately you can't have it up to a full hour."
1,just a foot vibrator!,"tell the king he has no clothes....what this machine does is vibrate your feet and nothing more! if that's what you want, fine...but ""ultra foot massager?""...gimme a break! there is NO MASSAGE here!"
2,Unhappy,"They didn't have a size chart to let you know what sm, med, lg, ex-lg, meant, so I ordered the medium and they were too small. I ordered a different color in the same size (med, which was an 8)and they were bigger for some reason, so I had to switch with my daughter.They were sooo soft and felt like walking on air at first, but about a week later the cushion is gone and it's like wearing covered flip flops now.I would not recommend."
4,This is OUT OF PRINT classic.,If you need cd-r's of almost ANY Harvey Mandel I do FREE CD-R copies for B(lanks)& P(ostage).Contact me at smoothbluz11 @ yahoo.com with Harvey Mandel in header.I do NOT SELL(bootleg)cd-r's.I do make FREE COPIES available on stuff hard to find or OUT OF PRINT.
2,Wonderful Adventure Flatly Told,"I'm a big fan of WWII prisoner of war tales, both real (The Long Walk, Ghost Soldiers, et al) and fictional (King Rat, Bridge on the River Kwai, et al), so I was intrigued by this account by an Italian of how he and two companions escaped their POW camp, climbed Mt. Kenya, and then snuck back into camp several weeks later. Unfortunately, while their adventure was undoubtedly remarkable, it never really comes alive in Benuzzi's book. I suspect much of the problem for me is that I know nothing about mountaineering and don't particularly find it interesting. The other difficulty I had was with the flatness of the prose, whether this is due to a weak translation or to Benuzzi's writing in a foreign language I don't know, but in any event, I found it rather tepid. So while I think the whole idea of his adventure is wonderful and in rather brilliant dark humor, I didn't find the telling equally so."
3,Interesting but not remarkable,"The best thing about the book is that it is believable. With that being said, it's just not real compelling."
4,Expected redline quality,"I've played with a number of redline products over the years. Coolants, motor oils, gear oils, atf's, etc. Some worked as advertised, some not so much. This review concerns their atf+4 equivalent fluid, labled c+. In normal ambient temps, it's performed as good as the factory fill. I was using it in a g56 trans mated to a cummins 5.9l, hoping it would solve some low temperature shiftability issues. It didn't. To be fair, it may be the nature of the trans design. I have not found anything to be concerned about on the magnetic drain plug or in the drain pan, but cold shifting didn't improve a bit. I'll be trying royal purple synchomesh next time around."
3,OK,"Not a high quality top of the line rug but it is OK for the price. Don't expect a lush thick carpet, but it works just fine for a inexpensive rug."
5,A pleasant surprise,"These ""bargain"" discs are usually bad audio and visual, but this package is something else. It is mostly clear (except for a couple of chapters) and the rare footage was very surprising; and, I do mean rare. The focus is on Germany, Japan, and Britain and the parts they played in the war. I found it extremely educational, but then again, I'm no expert in this matter. I'm learning more about the the wars and this was excellent for me. Pick this up before it's gone. The price is great too."
2,cracked,"My chillers arrived cracked from poor packaging. I was very disappointed, but they were beautiful. Amazon, however, gladly refunded my money. Plan to order again and have better packaging."
5,Good Laptop,"I love Macs! The only drawback on this computer is the mouse pad is not a smartpad. Also, the mouse button wasn't very sensetive."
4,Described perfectly.,This computer was described very accurately. I am happy with my purchase! Thank you for the fast shipping. I would recommend this seller!
3,...yeah...it's worth buying.,"My hope when buying this book was that I would find more indepth information about the creation of colors with insight coming from the people who assisted in its production. What I found was 1/3 of the book being redundant with Tibors book ""Perverse Optimist."" The last 1/3 of the book is a reproduction of issue 13 - an issue I already own - so that wasn't very helpful either.I was almost completely dissapointed with this book until I reached the middle section - an archive of Tibor's sketches, doodles and thoughts that help readers like myself see exactly how he initiated ideas for Colors Magazine. THIS IS WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. This fairly extensive section of the book offers heaps of photos that document Tibor's professional and activist life from High School onward. The supporting text by Maira is heart warming, funny and enlightmening. This section alone justifies buying the book."
2,"Sadly enough, I have to call this Disappointing as well","I was expecting more insight, more celebration, more highlights...and instead you have some very reduced page layouts (maybe 40% of the original) that can't be appreciated, Kalman's scribbles and comments, and the photography of Issue 13...What was the point???"
2,Not the complete issues,"Really Disappointing! If you're looking to have the first issues of COLORS don't buy this. This ""book"" synthesize at a very low level each issue and the text of some ""photos"" is impossible to read because of it's size."
4,Perfect for a klutzy guy with a Sony Ericsson T237,"I bought this case based on the description and pictures on sonyericsson.com. It's called the ""Active Case"" I guess because it's designed for people who want to carry a phone while exercising. I like it because I'm a klutz and know one of those flimsy leather cases wouldn't protect my phone from getting trashed when I bump it against something.I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because the silver fabric with black webbing exterior is a little funny-looking, though it's growing on me. It's cheap, and protects my phone, that's what's important to me.It comes with a stretchy armband to use to strap the case to your arm or leg. I don't think I'll use it, but it might be nice for runners or walkers on the road or on a treadmill.For the guy who wanted to know how big it is: my T237 phone is 3.9 x 1.7 x .7 inches (10.1 x 4.3 x 1.8 cm) and the case isn't more that .25 inches bigger on each side. And it fits perfectly."
1,Missing info,"It is the type of case I am looking for, but because they don't bother to state the size of it I must pass on it."
2,TV boring format.,"I only wish that these TV people would not be so damn cheap and pay someone that does research and then thuns that research into something exciting and interesting.I love Burns but think he is along for the ride getting all the money he can before he burns out, or he needs to start his own production company.Till then these mini documentaries are a nod out........I don't feel I got my money's worth from this 3 part series....."
4,Good History,"Overall very good detailed history of what was going on and ""why"" certain decisions were made. It is interesting how none of this stuff is taught in schools. This did a great job of ""filling in the gaps""."
5,Thrilling adventure - couldn't put it down!,"This was my second Kim Baldwin book and I am now hooked! Hunter's Pursuit is a well written, thrilling adventure that I didn't want to end. I loved the characters and I hope there is a sequel. This is the first book out of hundreds I have read that inspired me to write a review. Highly recommended!!"
1,"Handy to swap out, though only klutzes will need spares","I bought a spare 'cause it was on sale when I originally bought the mosquito magnet.The original is fairly sturdy and well made. After 3 seasons I have yet to need it. Unless you're a klutz and think you'll step on it or something you can simply rinse / wash out the original one and keep using it.That said, I use mine to swap out the full one for zero down time - especially when it's full of angry live biting mosquitoes...."
1,useless net for a useless device,"I still cannot believe that we purchased that piece of junk.I think I was fooled by the name of the company that produces the Mosquito Magnet, American Company of Biophysicists or similar, that sounded so scientific.Just think, Carbon Dioxide ( the attractant ) is produced by the decay of almost every organic material on the planet. It is the fizz in your soda bottle ....did you ever notice any mosquito diving into your soda can ? .. hahaSave your propane gas for your stove and do your wallet and the planet a favour, do not buy the mosquito magnet."
1,Doesn't seem contemporary,"Overly generous interline spacing has made a large book out of what is a effectively a small book. Much of the material in the book struck me as on the edge of redundant and out of touch with emerging developments. Many of the references are very dated (seventies and eighties material) and some are simply obscure. The book just isn't convincingly up to date.The emphasis on form filling will appeal to all those types who like to run software projects by form filling. There is no creative thrust to this book and the complimentary technology angles are weak. The CD contained nothing that I hadn't been aware of in other modes or hadn't created with MS Office components. It is largely an irrelevancy.For corporate types who want to roll out loads of flannel about elearning project management, this book may be a gem. For developers however, I would recommend Allessi and Trollip as a much superior text. Personally speaking, this book was not a good value purchase by me."
3,Flimsy binding for a lot of money,"The translation is great, much more annotation than the Geibel translation (tho I think an index would have been nice).Considering what this cost, I would have hoped the pages were held in with something better than rubber cement.My copy has pretty much exploded into about ten pieces... This is as flimsy as the cheapest pulp paperback!For a serious title at a serious price, a serious binding is really necessary."
3,Of all the ADD/ADHD books available...,"Dr. Gupta's book is a good resource. I highly recommend UNRAVELING THE ADD/ADHD FIASCO by Dr. David Stein. Stein's book takes a stand against amphetamines and offers a program to treat ADD/ADHD without drugs. It's a tougher book for parents as it does not offer the validation that it's okay to drug your kids. Everyone acknowledges how difficult this condition is to treat, but if you're serious about doing the right thing, books like Gupta's offer information, but not the tough stand."
3,"Very cute, not practical for learning.","This is a very cute book. It has multiplication fact rhymes.However, if your intent is for learning, this product is not for you. I thought it may help my third grader learn his times tables. It uses complicated wording and formulas.I'm not sure at what grade level this would be useful. I say if you have a child ages 10 (maybe) and up who just love math, go for it.Otherwise, leave it on the shelf."
3,Poor volume switch,The SS-400B is a great item that I purchased for me and my kids. I am afraid that the volume switch is too cheaply made to hold up to constant up and down volume use. Mine is left at a low volume for the Ocean sounds by which to fall asleep by. My girls were constantly using the radio (high volume) and various sounds for sleeping. The switch [broke] within a month and I had to send it back to Homedic. Mine still works but I worry about its longevity.
1,terrible quality,"- Sounds like statics, nothing like nature sounds- Time is off by a minute every day- un-readable from lying down position- timer totally unpredictableSummary: totally useless"
3,Not bad,"While it's not the best out there, you can't beat the price. My problems are that the screen that shows the time is small and not very bright so trying to read it at any type of angle or at night is difficult. The sounds are pleasant but tend to sound similar to each other. I like the buzzer alarm because it's more of a beeping and not one of those loud obnoxious grating sounds most alarms use. All in all, it's a good product for the low price."
1,Horrible machine that's useless,"Don't be fooled by Homedic's description. this is not a spa product. The clock is easy to set, but is a poor visual quality. The light on the clock is horrible. even worse, the nature sounds are horrible. they sound like static, and the sounds are way too repetitive. the radio tunes ok, but it is a poor sounding radio. the buttons are not good. they are terrible. And, the speakers are 9n the back. That makes it sound like it's coming from your other room. Sorry, but this product is a piece of junk. It broke after two weeks. It's a very poor quality. So avoid this and get a better system taht will work better for a long time. So avoid this horrible."
4,Does a pretty good job,"I just got this a few days ago and am thrilled to say that my neighbors are no longer keeping me awake. The ""white noise"" provided by this clock is enough to soften the impact of creaky floorboards and squeaky doors in our old building. The sounds are repetetive, but the wind and falls are just about right for background noise.The radio works very nicely, even in my basement apartment, and the controls are easy to understand. Unfortunately, the clock is difficult to read at night. The backlit digital display is rather dim, and the numbers are rather small for my myopic eyes.All in all, it does what the description says it will for a good price."
2,Blah,"My favorite part of the book was the photo on the front cover. It went downhill after that. I read this book almost a year ago and forgot I had it. That should tell you something.Forget that the book was choppy and simply dull, what bothered me so much was how dismissive Reed could be when she talked about her eating disorders. Right behind that, I had to wonder how she could be so disconnected from her family, particularly her children.It seems to me that Pam is running away from something. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone if what they're looking for is motivation or inspiration, or simply a role model.But it's a helluva read if you're looking for a strong example of a mental disorder that has manifested itself in such a way to look like an athlete.Good luck, Pam. When your body finally tires of this, I hope your kids are still around."
2,save your money,this is a 3 song EP that is badly produced. Do yourself a favor and buy Closing In instead. Early Man is a very good band but this EP is below standard
4,Well worth the 40 something price tag.,"It's not a pair of trained hands but it is well worth the amount of money that it is currently selling at. It does relax my tired back and as for the ""smell"" that others are speaking of my mat did not have any unpleasant oder so I'm not sure what they are talking about. I loved it so much I purchased one for my Mother in law."
1,"This is not a ""Masseur""","This device vibrates only. This is all it does, besides giving you a headache because of the noise produces by the upper motors."
3,More like my fishing than most videos,"Watching Ian and Charity fish the Great Smokey Mountains is more like fishing the streams here in Maine and New Hampshire. For that reason, I find their demonstrations more helpful than watching someone make beautiful backcasts on some Western river with big sky. The fishing in the Northeast is varied, but more often you are fishing over boulders and around brush.The production quality of the video could use some polishing but the content is worth it."
5,The Forbidden Circle,I read a few of the Darkover Series before and wanted to renew my memory. It was very relaxing and I'll be reading more soon.
5,GREAT TOY FOR TODDLERS :),I LOVE THIS ONE GREAT TOY...VERY DURABLE...OPEN SIDES WHERE WINDOWS ARE SO YOU CAN PUT LITTLE MEN IN THERE....ALSO HAS LADDERS THAT ARE VERY DURABLE AND HARD TO BREAK...ITS ALSO BIG....DOESN'T HAVE SOUNDS A PLUS FOR PARENTS...MY 3 YR OLD SON LOVES THIS TOY TO DEATH ITS ONE OF HIS FAVORITES
2,More disappointing every year...,"I have purchased the Monthly Scenic Desk Calendar now for a few years and each year the photos are of a poorer quality and almost dark looking instead of the vibrant, seasonal photos in my first Calendar. I'll probably not go with this choice again, maybe a Floral or the Harbor design but if the photos are of the same dingy quality I won't be buying At-a-Glance calendars any more!"
3,"Comfortable, but...","there are a lot of problems with it. First, the good points: Very comfortable, although if you have a lot of hair around your ears, they may be a bit snug. Very good sound, it's awesome.Bad points: The cord is WAY, WAY too long. I don't know how many times it's gotten stuck around my CD player and yanked it to the floor. I don't know how many times they've gotten stuck around door handles on cars, or armrests on cars. Also, the cord is VERY flimsy. They wear out way too quickly. I've had them for about four months, and already the padding around the ears is starting to rip, and the little tabs that go around your head are starting to pop off.Bottom line: I don't know. They're ..., and don't last long, the cord is long, I've cussed that thing so many times...However, it doesn't get stuck in your hair and it has great sound. Worth it, if you have money, but if not, get some standard headphones and wait till Sony makes them cheaper/better."
2,Pinches like hell,"The headphones are fine for sound - no complaints there, but they pinch my ears worse than any other headphone I've tried."
3,Good but not the best of the series,"As in the other books in the series, White uses twists and turns in the plot to keep the story moving and the readers guessing. His writing is often funny and never overly wordy. Managed care seems to be an underlying theme in the novel, and the author obviously has strong opinions about it, but it's pretty much incorporated into the natural story line; the readers are not slammed over the head with the message. This book won't keep you on the edge of your seat, but it will keep you interested."
5,wonderful book!,"This little book is full of gems. The essence of her book is based on science, whether she knows it or not. Her work comes from her heart, but it still holds validity in scientific circles. The whole concept of resonance and vibration is the secret. Vibrate with love and integrity, and vibrate with God and the Universe. This cannot be denied. Well, it can, but only by ignorants and those who would wallow in lies and misinformation.A wonderful book."
2,Not compelling for kids,"I just can't see a group of kids wanting to listen to this, nor can I see one picking it up to read. Nice idea, poor format. I'd rather see a story where the lead is a freethinking kid dealing with teachers and friends who are overtly religious. Johnny, you're not alone."
3,Ethan Hawks wrote this,"He's a good actor..This book isn't the best. But, Ethan does have a unique style.It's worth reading..I enjoyed the reading."
1,Thou Shall Not Read,"What an original plot Ethan Hawke has come up with: Two young people who were meant to be together and love one another for the rest of their lives just can't seem to get it together (what with all the obstacles thrown in their way), unless they make a serious effort. To make it really interesting(?), let's have the guy be AWOL from committments: his 'career'(The Army), his family, and even his religion. As for the girl - why she has 'committment issues' with men, due to her tattered relationship with her daddy, that she has yet to come to grips with. Throw in an unwanted preganancy and what do you have? A story that has been done many times before - only better from more capable writers (not to mention screen-writers, too). Sorry Mr. Hawke, don't give up your day job!"
4,Good stuff,"Let's get this straight: I don't listen to techno on a regular basis. I was traveling through the Frankfurt airport and I picked up this album because I wanted to own some good German techno. I made a good choice. It contains techno from several different countries (not just Germany).""Noise (Original)"" is the lowpoint of the CD. The beats are done at such a high pitch that it is painful to listen to, but on the other hand, it's an excellent song to annoy people with. ""Commandments (Die 10 Gebote)"" and ""Der Geigenzaler"" are my favorite two tracks. Both show that Germans are still the masters of techno with their strong beats. Both of those songs also have dark-voiced German mixed in, which makes for an excellent moody effect.As is typical of techno, there are songs that become positively obnoxious if played too much, but the CD has good variety, and if ya like techno or electronica, it's sure to please."
2,sensitive buttons,"Overall, I think the sound was good but I had trouble with the sensitive AM/FM band buttons. They are raised from the unit itself and if you hit them the channel changes and it is hard to find the station you were listening to, especially since I run while listening. I found this very frustrating. I tried to cover the buttons with something but it still jumped stations frequently. I gave up and bought another Sony walkman (cheaper model) and I am much happier with the dial I can turn myself and the sound is just as good."
1,Kaput in two months,"I bought it for the auto reverse feature and used it as a source in transferring my cassettes to mp3. About 20 tapes in it stopped working so I dug in and fixed the drive belt inside, and lost the auto reverse capability. That was olkay but then the tapes started speeding up during play and I could not control that. So I tossed the unit. A lesson learned. I think I need a tape deck instead."
5,So far I like it a lot,"I used to have a collapsible keyboard to go with my PDA, too, and though I never would type really fast on it, it certainly served its purpose well. With my laptop, a small lightweight one, typing on the keyboard is a real hassle and this is a very good solution. I expect my typing on it will improve as I go, but so far, I have no complaints at all. I studied all the various options I found for a portable keyboard and this one was the one I was most comfortable purchasing."
1,Waste of money!,"I purchased this item as recommended by my friend who gained 40+ lbs. during her pregnancy. She claimed to not have any stretch marks during her pregnancy due to this product. I figure, if this product worked for her, then maybe it can for me.This product was helpful in minimizing the itch that come along with stretching, but it did NOT prevent stretch marks. No product out there can prevent stretch marks....it's in the genes, and partially the diet. I was being hopeful with this product...expecting a miracle. LOL! Well, that hope lead to wasting all that $$$.I purchased 3 jars of this to last me the last 5.5 months of my pregnancy (when I noticed the first sign of a stretch mark). Product smells nice and helps keeping skin moisturized, but that's pretty much all it can do. Gaining just 26 lbs. throughout the pregnancy and delivering an 8 lb. 4 oz little girl, I didn't bother open the last jar and use post partum...I just re-sold it online."
5,So far so good,"I've used this twice a day since I found out I was pregnant. Smells great. I've not experienced any of the usual ""itchy belly syndrome"" that pregnant women experience. At 30 weeks still no stretch marks. I have repurchased and will keep repurchasing this product. HIghly recommend."
4,A tad pricey but great product!,I started with the Mama Mio oil and loved it so much I had to try the belly butter. It's wonderful. Smells great and absorbs really well. On days when I really want to make my belly soft I use the oil followed by the belly butter. I've tried several on the market and this is the best. Wish it wasn't so pricey...but that's my only beef with it.
2,will not work on my door,Mounting is for recessed windows that have sill across the bottom. Wanted to put on the door window but there is no sill. Have some ideas to make something that it can mount on and attach it to the door.
3,Good Book!,"This is a pretty interesting book for people in the graphic arts field. It details type styles, sizes, and the size of letters you should use for distances in sign making. I haven't had a chance to look it over real well but it's got a lot of practical information I will be able to use in the future."
5,Best book I have ever read!!!,"This book is absolutly a must have for every real Iron Maiden fan.Good stories from the early days and some great pictures.The only I can say is, if your a Maiden fan BUY IT"
4,Iron Maiden,"I bought this book for my husband as a Christmas present because he Loves Iron Maiden. The book was advertised expensively all over the internet. When we received it we found that the book is about Iron Maiden when Bruce Dickinson was not a part of the band. My husband and I feel that Bruce Dickinson is fifty-percent of the band on his own, so we were disappointed. But the book still has text from Dickinson and is a great resource for Iron Maiden fans. It also came in excellent condition, as promised by the vendor."
3,No the best,"This is a good toy but... it lacks educational value because you do not change the trailer by yourself. also why buy this toy, when you could buy the cheaper more durable and more realistic sper-con Optimus (unless you want to make super-optimus). Basically I would not reccomend this toy if the super-con optimus is available."
1,kinda boring but good toy,"Well for starters, a level 4 transformer is supposed to be the hardest of them all and good grief, i had him transformed in about 3 minutes with out the instructions in all the modes. i had more of a challenge with just ultra magnus from the rid line.the educational and fun part of this toy [is really bad], but its durable. its good for display and about it, otherwise dont buy it."
4,FYI,"MOST PEOPLE WRITING A REVIEW ON THIS ITEM SEEM NOT TO GET THE WHOLE IDEAL OF HOW FUN THIS TOY REALLY IS, THOUGH I DO AGREE WITH THE AUTO-TRANSFORMING CAB TO BE HORRIBBLE. THE TOY'S EDUCATIONAL VALUE AND HOW FUN IT IS COMES DOWN TO ONE THING, WHICH IS HOW OLD YOU ARE. THINK ABOUT THIS LOGICALLY FROM ALL THE REVIEWS THEY SAY THIS WAS PERCHASED FOR VERY YOUNG CHILDREN, THIS TOY IS VERY COMPLEX AND HARD TO TRANSFORM. I SUGEST THIS TOY FOR KIDS 10+."
1,Save your money,"My 4 1/2 year old son received this for Christmas; it is going back to the store as soon as possible. It is a horrible toy; I tried to decipher the instructions and cannot get the thing to work for him. There were alot of little pieces that kept falling off, etc. I would think this is for a much older child with alot of patience...even though the box is marked for 5 and up...."
2,Not too pleased,What I love: the top sheet tucks into the mattress - very convenient for a fidgety 2 yr old.What I hate: the fabric balls up & is not very comfortable after a couple of washings.
1,Disappointing,"Well researched but poorly presented. Disjointed. Awful flow. No new insights. The takeaways or ""aha's"" were hard to find. Living in Dallas, Dr. Coopers reputation is unsurpassed. His research center is deserving of this reputation. However, his most recent books and health club facility fall far short of his medical expertise."
4,pet door,this pet door is great. our dog is so cute sticking her head out the door first to have a look around. Has a good seal and we are happy with it.
2,Heavy and Slippery,"I have wanted a pair of Sorel boots for as long as I can remember, and was delighted when I received them for x-mas. After wearing them today, they are being returned. Going from the wet and snowy outdoors and into various businesses, I slipped and nearly fell every time. I think these boots just like to have snow under them.Oh, and they are very heavy. After just a short walk my legs felt like they do after running 5-miles."

3,"Inserts too small, boot too big.","I just received these boots after waiting 3 weeks from the day ordered them. I had originally bought a different pair of Sorels but they were too big. I decided to get the Caribou's instead. I love in Vermont and many of the student's on my campus wear these. I figured they would be worth the 100 dollars. I put them on as soon as they arrived. I couldn't get my foot in! I had ordered the 8 in the other pair and the 7 in this pair. Eventually I figured out I could get the insert out and literally squeeze my foot into it and then put it back in to the boot. Now that it's in the boot, and the boot feels big. It would be nice if these fit. 100 dollars is a lot of money for a college student. I would send them back, but my other old pair takes in water and I can't wait another 3 weeks for another pair. Sorels used to be the way to go for winter boots, but now I'm not so sure. I hope they keep my feet warm!"
1,No Deal!!,Don't be fooled!! I live in Alaska where everything's more expensive and I got the same exact boot for $65 REGULAR PRICE!!! what a joke!@!
2,Too Big and Too Small,"I know these are supposed to be a utility boot, but the rubber part is enormous and the liner was too small for my feet. If the fit had been better, I am sure that they would be a great work boot.I sent them back. Had to call the company for a return label because they they were purchased through Amazon. The seller (Moose Jaw) was wonderful!"
3,sorel womens caribou boots,"The look of the boot is as expected. I ordered a size bigger and it fits for the most part, but is very difficult to get on very very snug and takes a lot of muscle to pull on. Once it is on then it fits. I sprayed the boots with weather proofing. We will see how it holds up this winter in water and snow."
4,good choice,"I am very happy with my purchase. I live in wisconsin, and for the first time when out on the ice helping new snow-kiters, I had warm feet!Sizes run big. I am a 6.5 normally and got a 5 that with mid/heavy weight smartwool socks is snug, but works.Very warm boots, they don't feel clunky and actually don't look too big.Love them."
3,A little small,"While I absolutely love these boots, the sizing is way off. I usually wear size 6 to 6 1/2 and I bought a size 7 because of the reviews. Well after a few weeks of trying to break them in it is obvious that these are too small even though I ordered about two sizes up. I can wear them ( almost comfortably) without socks but then I am getting blisters. I recommend finding a pair in a store and trying them on and then ordering the size that fits rather than going by the reviews and published sizes. Other than the size issue, the boots are extremely well made"
5,Heavy Duty,"Not just for looks, these boots are very well made. They are thickly lined with remove-able fleece liner, the leather suede is thick to hold up for real hiking. The sole of the shoe has deep treads to help you get a good grip even in slippery muddy places.The size is true, so if you are an 8 1/2, I would recommend getting the 9 not the 8."
2,Not your traditional pinata,"I bought this pinata not realizing it was the ""string pull style"" and NOT the kind that you would hit with a stick and let the candy fall out. Each child chooses one of the attached colored ribbons and pulls them at the same time. The catch is only one of the ribbons is attached to a release switch that opens a hidden compartment thus allowing the candy to fall out. If you try to use this pinata the traditional way, depending on how heavy it is, the pinata may fall to the floor after a few good whacks and the hanging loop on top will break."
4,Birthday pinata,"My son loved this pinata!! He asked for a spongebob birthday and he was totally excited about his spongebob pinata. The only downside to the pinata is that all but one of the ribbons broke before they were able to open it, but, all in all, it worked out and they really enjoyed it!"
5,So nasty it's perfect!,We tried this product in our first attempt to get our 3 year old daughter to stop sucking her thumb. It worked like a charm! We used it for only about 4 days before she stopped attempting to put her thumb in her mouth. I even gave it a little taste and can confirm it's nasty stuff! Well worth the money.
3,"Should work, can't believe it doesn't for my son","There is nothing wrong with this product, if it were for me, it would definatley work, but for some reason it doesn't phase my son. I think he's just an oddball, bc the stuff tastes nasty. I would reccommend it for thumb sucking even though it doesn't work for my son, I don't know why."
5,SUPER Effective!,"This stuff tastes awful. But that means that it is really, really effective. After nearly 30 years of biting my nails, it had me trained to stop in just a week! It will get in your mouth if you're eating appetizers by hand though, so that's the downside."
5,wonderful,This is the best product for putting an end to thumb sucking. Daughter told me she was going to suck it off and just keep sucking her thumb like she has done with all other products we have used. But 1st application proved she couldn't stand the taste. I'd like to say it smells and tastes like polish remover but its a little thicker in order to sty on. Yes it really does stay on for days even with washing.
2,healthier hair but orange red hair,"I wanted to try this for a change because it's completely natural and actually very good for your hair. I gave this two stars instead of one because it definitely made my fine hair healthier, stronger, and it looks thicker too -- but only two stars because the ""light brown"" color turned my hair orange red! I mixed it with brewed coffee too, which is supposed to cut the red. The coffee didn't work, at least not on my hair. I'm just glad I own a very nice wig."
3,Hmm,"I love this product because it's very natural.I add quite some things to it, like a little bit of vinegar, olive oil, lemon juice, chamomile essential oil etc.. I have dark blond hair, quite strait, and the end of it touch my tits. I really take care of my hair and this product doesn't make them that much better that they already are ^^...But I love its natural ingredients, so I still buy it and use it sometimes."
3,nice for beginners,"I applied this to my daughter's hair. Her natural color is dark blonde to light brown. The Persian Light Brown gave her golden to strawberry blond highlights. It looked very nice, shiney and so soft. This is a nice product for those that don't want to chemically treat their hair.On the down side is application and mess. It is really messy and thick. You have to work to get it evenly throughout your hair. Tip: have a friend help you. It takes several minutes to get all of the organic matter out of your hair. I suggest using a nice conditioner to help move the product out of your hair."
3,Not a bad book but could have been better,"This is a good book but readers would be better off getting Permaculture a Designers Manual, by Bill Mollison first, and then use this book as an additional reference for more ideas. as the editorial reveiw says it is an A-Z reference. Permaculture a Designers Manual is a how-to reference which I beleive makes any book more valuable than an A-Z reference and this is the only reason why I am giving this book 3 stars."
4,help,eTex or eMap which one is better for detailing streets. And is there a handheld GPS with audio for turn by turn information.
1,Stopped working immediately,"Pricey junk. It worked once (the green light flared and dimmed), then it stopped working altogether. No lights, no matter which outlet I plug it into. The outlets I'm testing are hot -- vacuums, nightlights, computers all work when plugged into them. This tester is a useless paperweight."
4,I'm proud to own it,"This is a wonderful book that any Beatles fan, and especially George Harrison fan, will love to read and re-read-- and also just thumb through. The majority of the book contains photographs (many of which I'm sure are very rare-- a couple of shots of George as a boy, some great pictures of the Beatles' early days, and many more) and song lyrics with explanations. The song lyric section was the most enjoyable for me-- you get full lyrics, handwritten drafts, and (at times) very detailed stories of how a particular song came about. My favorite is the story behind Savoy Truffle (one of my favorite Beatles songs)! This book will have a treasured place on my shelf and in my heart, as will George."
3,Don't Bring Me Down...,"...should have been the title. The book is based on short recorded interviews with George Harrison recorded by Neil Aspinall, which barely fills a forth of the book contents! The remaining contents consist of George's songs and how they were written at conception. George didn't give us much insight into Beatlemania that we all didn't know already. However, I did learn that you can be very talented and successful beyond anyones wildest dreams, and still be a whiner! 3 stars, only because I'm still a super Beatle fan."
2,Not what I expected,"Disappointing, garbled, disjointed ""preview"" of what is a wonderful story. More of a book of lyrics than anything else. Too much of the lyrics not enough of the story. An example of the disorganisation is the photograph section which has the comment or explanation of each photograph as a list in the appendices at the back of the book rather than onthe same page as the relatve photograph where there is enough room to include it, weird!"
4,Solid Advice for Difficult Situations,"This book provides a solid foundation for customer interactions anywhere. It is straightforward, easy to read and a valuable tool to help staff deal, particularly, with difficult customers."
1,Three Miles Down: A Hunt for Sunken Treasure,"A waste of time, the author spends all his time chattering without saying anything. He's so full of himself he has no time for the story."
5,Practical and comfortable,"This is the ideal case for those of us who don't like to have our PDAs in our pockets: you can use the belt loop to carry it around. Its padding covers every side of the Visor and it will prevent any unfortunate accidents. It is big enough to let you carry the protective cover that comes with every Visor, so you'll have double protection... My only complain is that sometimes it is a little hard to get your Visor out quickly, but it is a minor inconvenience."
2,Missing the most important stories.,"I can't agree with the reviewers who praise this new set. It includes all the short stories, but leaves out ALL FOUR of the ""novellas,"" that is ""A study in scarlet,"" ""The sign of the four,"" ""The hound of the Baskervilles"" and ""The valley of fear."" By virtue of their length these are the richest of the Holmes stories and would be the most interesting to have annotations of. But more important, the first two were the first published of the Holmes stories and gave Doyle the success needed to continue. Their position in the development of Holmes's and Watson's relationship is crucial; their description of the two men's histories is essential; and their role in the phenomenon that is Holmes's part in our culture is basic. To leave them out (with the promise that a third volume, in 2005, will finally complete the series) is, I think, to serve purchasers of the first two volumes very badly."
4,Great for Spanning-Tree,I bought this book mostly for a review of Spanning-Tree and it is that. It is the best Spanning-Tree book available. It goes into more detail than I've ever seen before. It's not for beginners though.
5,great for Spanish lit class,"This book is perfect for my 18th century Spanish literature class. All of the readings are in Spanish, but there are helpful English glosses. The readings are samples from neoclassicist writers with a uniquely Spanish flair on enlightenment."
2,Very Simple and a bit unbelievable,"This book was an easy read as it was very ""simple"". The plot/substance just wasn't there. This may be partly due to the main characters unbelievable ability to be super intuitive with the ability to know just about everything.That said if you are just looking for some simple brain candy, as stated the book is an easy read."
3,Good but it felt rushed...,Over all this was a good book but I felt it was very rushed. The characters were very flat and could of been much better.
1,Awful,This book is simply awful. I second everything in Michael D. Garcia's review. Ugh. I can't believe I bought this as a hardback.
3,"a rather humdrum ""action"" story","Although I usually enjoy Mike Resnick's books, I just couldn't get into this latest. The ""hero"" is protrayed as an arragont officer who continually expresses contempt for most of his Republic's leadership and officers. He has trouble with any type of authority and ALWAYS has brains and means, somehow, to pull of a contretemps against the enemy. I saw his leadership as lacking, though the author took the tack of everyone lauding him, even his enemies, throughout the story, in the end. This was the first in a proposed trilogy, but I will save my money and not buy the next two."
2,"Might have been good, but for one thing...","I was thoroughly enjoying this book....until the abortion. I don't know why the author threw something so terribly taboo into a historical romance novel, especially when this is supposed to be romantic and happy. I was disgusted that the heroine injested the pills that would abort her baby when she could have kept it and faced the consequences of her actions. Other than that moment, I have already forgotten what I did read of it. It just totally turned me off. If you want great funny, tender, romanctic stories then read some of Gaelen Foley, Johanna Lindsey, Sabrina Jeffries, and Lisa Kleypas. Keep this one on the shelves."
3,good tent for CALM weather,This tent is just fine for fair weather camping trips. once the wind starts kicking up this tent turns into a sail and the poles get bent to razor sharp points.
4,No Need To Wax,"Until I tried DuraShine and DuraWash, I was a fanatic about trying to keep wax on my automobiles. With wax, the acid rain sits on the sutface of a car and etches into the paint. The Dura products sheet water from the painted surfaces and keep auto finishes sparkling. I've been using there products for a least 8 years and have not been disappointed. Dura directions say you can let the surface air dry after application but if you have hard water, it's best to towel dry to keep the sparkle."
4,Omigod omigod!,"This is not a book to be read immediately before or immediately after a meal.You will learn more about the logistics of removing human waste from wilderness areas than you probably cared to know.You may find yourself screaming in horror as you hurl this book as far as the walls of the bathroom will let you.You will laugh and in the process, you will learn something about whitewater rafting from the stories, the diagrams, and the glossary in the back.This is a bathroom classic. Choose your time for reading it carefully!"
3,Better decoration for a cabin latrine than reading,Takes about thirty minutes to read the stories involving the misadventures of the crap bag. Picked up a couple good stories to share and will have more fun telling than reading so it was an okay purchase from half.com at 75 cents plus three dollars shipping.
2,Avoid this one,This had to be one of the worst romance novels I've ever read. I expected better from Ms. Edwards. Sasha was a totally stupid heroine...I couldn't like her even a little. Ashton wasn't very believable either. Don't waste your money on this one. It's an even bigger waste of time!
3,"Mono Puff: Half of TMBG, half the talent.","Although Mono Puff's latest, ""It's Fun To Steal"" has its definite high points, it will probably be enjoyed only by die-hard They Might Be Giants fans. The songs that do best on this album are the ones that do not have only good music, but good lyrics--for more often than less, the music fails. Songs that will probably be enjoyed by just about any They Might Be Giants fan, die-hard or not, are those which sound most similar to songs made by They Might Be Giants, whom John Flansburgh is a member. The main failing is that the album does not have the cleverness nor structure that a They Might Be Giants album would have. John Flansburgh's talents are better showcased on those albums, not Mono Puff's."
1,Full of embarrassing inaccuracies...,"It should be noted 'pillow book' refers most specifically to a work by Sei Shonagon, a court lady of the Heian Era.The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon(Makura no soshi) was written sometime in the late 900s-early 1000s and is a collection of notes and personal thoughts about Heian court life, a diary. To my knowledge 'pillow book' is not commonly used as a general term and does not typically describe an erotic work.This glaring error as well as the others previous reviewers have mentioned should call into question the veracity of this book. If one simply wants to look at Japanese erotic (of questionable authenticity) then this book will suffice. If one is looking for accurate depictions of geisha or true antique Japanese erotica one would be advised to look elsewhere."
3,It's Good....,"It's a good CD when your working or doing your Homework. Track number 3 its not very good, the rest are very good."
4,Why not better audio quality?,"I have owned this on a Columbia album since it first came out and I read a great review of the performance in Stereo Review magazine. I purchased the download MP3 to replace my badly worn album to hear clicks on the track indicating it may have been dubbed from an album instead of the CD or even better a master tape.Great performance of the Rhapsody In Blue (with Gershwin at the piano) none the less, I just wish Amazon would ""clean up their download"" act. This is not the first download mastered from scratchy disks that I have purchased."
2,pretty poor,"I took a chance on this one and it didn't work out so well. Oh well, it happens every so often."
2,BORING,"This is one of the most boring books I have ever read. Although his thoughts of prose and propaganda are evident. This is the worst mystery book I've ever read. I bought it on-line and can't send it back. So, you got me. I can't see the involvement in the subtifuge of politics. And the whole thing with the dog is just lame. Thanks anyway."
5,Brilliant,"The four impromtus are Chopin in a lighter mode -- basically salon music. But the three pieces that end this CD are something else. The Barcarolle is one of Chopin's most beautiful creations. The Berceuse is hushed, rapt, almost religious. And the Fantasie in F minor is quite simply one of the master's most masterful inspirations. Beginning with a quasi funeral march, spiralling through deeply-emotional episodes, it is a rollercoaster of a piece that scales the heights and plumbs the depths of the soul.Perahia's playing is beautiful throughout -- light as gossamer when needed and muscular and virile when that is required. He really is one of our most versatile virtuosos, equally at home in Bach, Bartok and Chopin. Highly recommended."
1,Dissappointed,I purchased American Nudist with great expectations of finally seeing a good film that would portray nudism in a good way. While the film did basically that I found it was mostly a cut and paste of Clothes-Free.com news videos. The remainder of the film was very confusing and I sat there waiting for the plot to begin.
4,nice consistent material,"It seems that these days hip-hop soundtracks arent all that, but every once in a while one comes along that is actually worth the money. This is that one, it has lots of bangers on here!!!!! Solid material throughout, but the best song has got to be music by Erick Sermon.I know you've heard it on the radio by now. Its so funky with Marvin Gaye croonin' with the green eyed bandit, also another surprise what Ray Benzino's joint bang to this. The whole album isnice,solid,consistent and fresh. Get it, also check for the fast and furious soundtrack!!!! It's hot tooo!!!!"
4,Good Quality,"The CD was a very good price and shipping was resonible, package arrived a couple days before the estimated time and in great condition"
1,Major Disappointment,"First one I purchased began a continual pause after about the first three minutes of play. Returned it for exchange. Second one played fine for the first 20 minutes (105 minute DVD) and then it started pausing for increasingly longer periods until it was no longer playable. I probably should have given it 2 stars because it actually accomplishes, if it could play properly, what this bluegrass student/customer was looking for (and is still looking for). However, this made me even more frustrated with the DVD defects and resulted in my ""I Hate It"". Incidently, tried cleaning both DVDs - No help. Tried playing on different players and computers - all the same. Bottom Line - Both DVD's were defective - What a MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!!"
4,T-mobile MDA Vario,Interesting keyboard extremely useful for quick sms texts. Good connection manager. Could be a little bit faster at processing. External buttons tend to switch on by accident when youre on the phone. Overall its a good product.
4,Top Notch Family Discussion Starter,The Chimes continues the family oriented values that Dicken's A Christmas Carol begins. Your family will love the colorful clay animation and lovely voice track by the renown British actor Derek Jacobi. This video will help to start your family's discussion of universal hope and faithfulness amidst the darkness. A wonderful addition to the Adelante Films library.
3,spoils the memories,"I disagree with the other reviewers. All through this CD I found myself thinking how wonderful this would have been if recorded earlier in Cleo's career. Not even Cleo's great voice can last forever, the high ranges still sound fine but mid range has gone. A sterile performance from her backing musicians doesn't help either. Far better to enjoy her fabulous earlier recordings."
3,Great costume except for the mask,"The costume quality is great with its molded chest and belt. The only problem I have is with the mask. My son has so much difficulty in seeing out of the mask (even in daytime, and this is his halloween costume so will be trick'or'treating in the dark) that he's unable to wear it. Which is probably a good thing because the 2nd bad thing about the mask is that the bottom of it, as it's solid plastic, forms a fairly sharp edge which is pretty dangerous for a 5 year old.If I had to do it again, I'd go for the cheaper costume with a different mask."
3,very cheaply made,"what a cheaply made costume for $40, wish I hadn't wasted my money on it. the areas that have color in the picture are pieces of rubber that have been hastily painted. I'm very disappointed in it. My child is 5 and he will have a hard time wearing the mask, it is heavy and it's hard to keep it on with the velcro strings."
2,darth not right size,The size was deceiving. It stated for 5 to 7 years but was size 8 to 10. Would not buy it again.
3,Mask was missing from package,"I waited too long to order Halloween costumes and when this came in the day before Halloween I was very upset that the mask somehow was left out of the package. I called them and they offered to either ship me the mask or refund me $5 for the missing mask. I took the money because there was no way the mask would make it on time.The costume itself looked pretty good. I ordered a size up from what they recommended and it fit perfectly over my son's clothing. I wish he had the mask on Halloween night, but he probably would have ended up ditching it within the first 30 minutes."
4,Good Costume But The Mask Needs Work,"Attractive costume that my son really enjoys. The mask, though, is very painful to wear. There's a piece of foam inside that's supposed to protect your nose but it's not very effective and the glue comes off easily, meaning you have to reattach the foam. It has a band that goes around your head to hold it on and that, too, easily comes loose. Our mask was also scratched in the package -- when we opened the package, there was a very visible scratch on the chin area. Aside from that, the suit looks great and it's very fun for a little Star Wars fan."
4,soy tu duena,me gusto mucho.lucero y colunga una de las mejores parejas de telenovelas me encantan. aunque pude notar que le cortaron bastante al final.es una pena porque la novela es buenisima con tremendo elenco.no me arrepiento de haberla comprado.no entiendo porque no las venden completas en vez de danarlas haciendo un mal resumen.
1,where are my stuff again?,"It's the second time that the pkg not arrive in the specified address.Please, give me the name and/or phone number of the company who deliver the good (in Argentina), and I personally call they to ask about the situation of the order.I wait to hear from you"
5,Love My Hair!,My hair was a mess before I tried this conditioner and the shampoo. The ends were like straw from color damage and the roots were oily because that's the way my hair is. It's also very fine. I did a lot of research before coming upon this product and I can say I'm extremely pleased! My hair feels soft and strong. It's shiny and looks very healthy. Well worth the money. I'll never use another shampoo and conditioner.
2,"keratase, ciment anti-unsure conditioner",The delivery time was not up to Amazon standards. This conditioner leaves my hair too weighted down and lifeless.
1,Horrible fake product I received!!,Received a fake product. Very strong odor and EXTREMELY RUNNY. Never had and issue when purchasing from the Salon etc. Great results with the real product. So buyer beware!!!!
2,Not so hot,"This is the only Kerastase product that I purchased that I wished I had saved my money. This got some great reviews. Hair textures are different from person to person and this one for my hair really did nothing. The label says it's a ""heat reconstructor milk for weakened hair"". You put it on your hair and leave it on. Wasn't good, wasn't bad. Did nothing."
4,nice book,I liked it. Good pictures and information. Orchids are wonderful to grow and I am into the smelly and pretty ones.
3,Ok but misleading.,"This book has some value. But somethings are wrong. The use of the wand and the dagger are BACKWARDS! Air is dagger, fire is wand. Not the reverse. Too simplified. Read Kraig's Modern Magick"
4,Best of recent Wetton live albums,"This is the best of John Wetton's recent group of live albums, and it clearly makes up for the tragedy that was ""XM Live."" Wetton sings wonderfully on this release, and he includes an excellent setlist that draws equally from King Crimson, Asia, and the best of his solo work. He is ably supported by John Mitchell (Kino) and Martin Orford (IQ) on these songs. Very welcome are the inclusion of two tracks from his underrated ""Rock of Faith"" album."
5,"Fits right in with 3 other of his CDs, soothing, fun bossa nova","And it's not just plain bossa nova. There's a bit 'o scamp to his music that shows up here and there in some songs. When I want to hear something that's both soothing and yet not sappy or mass market poppy, this is what I go to along with his other three great CDs: Subtle Body, Prize and Invoke, in that order. Unfortunately, I have not heard Mundo Civilizado which, based on reviews, fits right in with this category nor have I heard Salt which may not belong in this group.If you know Arto Lindsay from being in DNA this is the opposite end of the musical spectrum from that grating guitar, I'd say exciting music of the last 70's, early 80's. This is for high quality relaxing of the mind. His voice is so perfect for this style of music, it's half of what's best about these records. The other half is the classic bossa nova style that's never stuffy or sounding like it's from a 50's record (not that that's a bad thing). chrisbct@hotmail.com"
2,Badly needs to be re-written,"The storyline is ok, but the obvious spelling and grammatical errors show that the manuscript was run through a spell-checker, and not proof-read before publication. The serious mistakes made in this book greatly detract from the story line as you have to continually mentally correct the numerous grammatical problems, creating a gross dis-service to the readerThis book needs to be recalled, re-written and re-published. I'm surprised that any bookstore would carry it, considering the serious problems it has."
3,nothing special,"Tried this soap becase of the great lavender mint shampoo they make. The soap is a strong aroma similar to the tea tree shampoo. The soap bar gets soft easilier than other soaps if left in the shower. Does lather up well and smells good. Don't us it near the eyes it burns, almost as if I had rubbed some mentholatum cream on. Shipping cost me $9.50 for one bar of soap, I'd be better of with a quart of the Lavender mint shampoo and bathe with that. heh.. Next time I will get it if it costs me no more that $3 a bar and free shipping. Otherwise the scented liquid soaps at walgreens are just as good."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,EVERYONE RATES AT HOW GREAT THIS SOAP IS... WELL ITS NOT!!! I WOULD'NT RECOMMEND IT. SPECIALLY SINCE IT SAYS IN THE BOX THAT IF ITS NOT SOLD BY A PROFESSIONAL STYLIST ITS PROLLY A FAKE OR SOME BLACKMARKET SCAM. IT DEFINITELY DID NOT DO WHAT THE OTHER SOAP I BOUGHT FROM THE NUBIAN BRAND.ITS GOOD FOR YOUR FEET THATS ABOUT IT NOT FOR WHOLE CORPORAL USE.
3,Interesting background on your favorite children's books,"This book makes a fun gift for new parents, who sometimes need to be reminded about the classics from their childhood, as well to learn about the books published since they were kids. Like anyone who is passionate about children's literature, I have my own opinions about the books that should be listed in the top 100 and I disagree with some of the author's selections. But, I think the real value of this book is the short essays about the background behind the classic children's books we know and love. I didn't know, for example, that Ezra Jack Keats's ""The Snowy Day"" was controversial when it was published for his use of an African-American protagonist. So, my recommendation of this book is based less on its function as a list and more as interesting background for people interested in children's lit."
2,Needs a copyeditor,"This is an ambitious book, as well as an expensive one. However, the text is appallingly full of editorial errors: There's a misspelling, dropped word, or sentence garbled to the point of incomprehensibility on nearly every page. For example, the name of the great Civil War photographer Mathew Brady is misspelled Matthew in both the text and the index. This reader nervously wondered whether the author is as careless with his facts as he is with his written English."
4,Intimate intergenerational story w/ historical scope,"I really loved the three main characters-- daughter, mother & grandmother-- and how Southgate gave each one her own secrets, desires, and space within the narrative to bloom, with some delicious surprises. It's a real talent to be able to take the reader into these unique private worlds of three different characters with each one feeling fully formed and alive. I'm also a sucker for those kinds of intergenerational stories. In this case we were treated to an intimate view of the experience of being an African-American woman within three specific and very different time periods. And, hey, it's sexy too!I hope this will find the wide and enthusiastic audience it deserves..."
2,disappointing read,"I purchase this book after viewing the documentary which provided more insight into the kind of man he became and what made him turn into a murder. The structure of the book was disappointing as well. It did not hold my interest, so I did complete the book."
2,Does not work on a Nissan 300ZX,"According to the manufacturer's web site, this is the correct harness for a 1996 Nissan 300ZX with a Bose radio. This harness appears to be well constructed and has the correct mating connectors, but all four speaker connectors are on RCA male plugs. They should be straight wires. The leads on the plugs are spliced onto short color coded wires coming from the harness and the spliced wires are all the same color, so if you cut the connectors off, there is no way to determine which wire is positive and which is negative. Most radio wiring harnesses require bare wire for the speaker connections, not RCA plugs. I would have given this one star if not for the good construction. Since this harness is used for a number of Nissan cars, check on your model before you buy. Buy the Scosche wiring harness instead if you need bare wires instead of RCA plugs."
3,Just OK,"I had been taking the New Chapter Prenatal and then Women's One a Day vitamins for the last couple of years. I loved them but they're so expensive so I decided to give these a try. The pills do smell a little gross but not too bad. For me, these vitamins don't seem to be as effective as the New Chapter vitamins. In fact I really can't tell any difference when I take these vitamins versus when I don't. The positive is that they don't make me feel sick at all even on an empty stomach. This is a big bottle and I plan on finishing them but I will be ordering New Chapter next time."
5,Great for me.,"I think the biggest complement that this vitamin receives is that I have actually finished the bottle and want to order more (currently ordering the 3rd!). This brand was recommended to me by my sister who was excited to find a prenatal that did not upset her stomach. I always eat prior (breakfast) and seem to be just fine. After my success with this vitamin, I have also begun taking Omega 3--any stomach urp-y that I get I'm sure is from the fish oil rather than the vitamin.While no product is right for all of us, I'm very pleased with these vitamins for me. When comparing to drug store brands be sure to read how many pills you need to take to reach the printed daily values- I was shocked to see one brand recommending 4 pills a day.Good luck! :)"
1,UGH! Can barely swallow it!,"I agree with the other 1 star reviews. Big pills, bad taste (tasted like grass mixed with mud), made me gag. The kicker was the nausea I got from them. Not sure if I am just super sensitive but I tried with food, in the evening before bed, before I ate, right after I ate, with hot tea, with cold milk. Didn't matter, made me sick. However the ingredients are just what I want in a vitamin and I really tried to take them because I know they are good for you. I was able to choke down a half bottle but I can't do it anymore. Unfortunately I bought 2 bottles and now I have an unopened bottle and a half left. Too late to return them so I am going to write the company."
2,On-Off Design Challenges,"I received my MFUEL Universal Power Bank 9200 mAh Li-Ion Battery Pack with great anticipation for use on around the world airplane flights -and although the product does provide the additional juice as advertised, it has some real design challenges - the unit I received will turn on with any pressure to the top of the battery pack (without even hitting the on-off button), which means it will turn on while in a briefcase and begin to drain precious battery life. The design is flawed -- one must hold down the on-off switch for a few seconds to turn off the unit, but it takes no effort at all to turn on the switch - it definately needs a better on-off switch.Also, after just one use, the small rubber pads on the bottom of the battery came off.Also, the unit I received has a label that indicates that it was made in CHENA --- I am not sure where CHENA is located, but the label may be indicative of the quality of this product."
4,:),I personally have not used Duo but im going to to compare the two. this kind takes awhile to dry but once it does they stay on quite well but they also come off easily and i havent lost all my lashes so im happy with the product
4,NEXT STEP AFTER PIMSLEUR CDS!--LEARN ALBANIAN!!,"I am about half-way through this book and it is thorough, consistent and builds on previous lessons. I'd recommend not proceeding to the next chapter until some mastery (maybe 75%) of the current lesson is achieved.There are a few typos and some other nit-noid things, but there's not much else out there that is this comprehensive.My only complaint is that the book is not bound well. It is starting to come apart at the binding."
4,Solid piece of steel,I have several 1x8 tpi chucks and faceplates from my old lathe. This adapter has allowed me to continue to use them all. My alternative would have been to buy new faceplaces and adapters for each of my chucks.This is an excellent solution. The only downside is you loose about 2in between centers.
3,"""Come on, you little sucker! Stick!!!""","Ok. I know my way around a needle. So good, that on occasion, the callous on my finger will actually split, and allow a the tip of some of the smaller needles to actually penetrate my skin, causing pain and untold cursing. Some years ago, I discovered these and found that just a single dot could cover my bruised and bleeding finger, to allow me to continue to work. I have tried their ""adhesive thimble"" but the shape and thickness caused the adhesive to give out and it would lift and peel off of my finger. These worked better by far.But, I think they have changed the materials. Now, these will also quickly peel away from curvature of my finger. I went through one. Two. Three. Four. ***Five adhesive dots*** in one afternoon of sewing. I finally got so desperate that I covered the dot with a bandaid to keep it on my finger.Do they work? Well, kind of. Just buy some bandaids along with them."
2,You get what you pay for,"This vacuum is cheap in cost and cheap in quality. It has pretty low suction, but it would be adequate if I didn't have two dogs who shed so much. The filter gets very dirty even though it's in a separate compartment and it takes forever to clean decently. The power attachment is useless, even though I haven't had any problems with it not spinning. What works better is just to forgo using the power brush attachment and not use anything at all. I would not buy this vacuum again, and only give it two stars because of it's cheap price and that it picks up decently, even though it takes two or three passes to get really clean. Just FYI: Do Not use a powdered carpet freshener with this model. If you need to freshen after vacuuming, use some febreze.Edit: I wanted to add that I am writing this review 6 months after purchasing the vacuum and so have used it much longer than people who have reviewed this product after one use."
4,Great Sweeper,Does a great job of picking up regular dirt and hair from my German Shepard. The dirt canister needs emptied about every other sweeping to insure it picks up properly. Both the pre-filter and Hepa filter get pretty dirty and must be cleaned properly each time.But..... if you're willing to do this you will have a great sweeper at a real value price!
2,Hoover,Not the best for a so called lightweight vacuum. I think I would buy another vacuum before I spend $40.00 on a new filter. Not as easy to whip out the hose and get into crevices. I was in love with my Shark that now is historyand discontinued that model
2,This vacuum (doesn't) suck!,I'm not impressed with the sucking ability of this vac...it won't even clean my oriental rugs. I'm even more disappointed that I relied on all my fellow reviewers here. Is Hoover doing these ratings?!?!
3,Great for a few months then parts start breaking,"I loved this vac when I first got it, light weight, powerful, easy to clean, nice machine. However it started breaking parts one at a time. Belt broke at 1 month, I replaced it, at 2 months the plastic ring that holds the extension pipe broke in half, now I store it separately. Now at 4 months one of the screws that holds the hood on over top of the brush snapped off the plastic piece that holds it in place. Not very mechanical but with this no longer screwed down tight, for some reason brush won't turn on carpets. I now have to replace the entire vac.I'm not a heavy user, I live in a house trailer and normally only vacuum the living room every day. Rest of house once a week. I'm sad to see it go but I won't be buying another one."
1,NOT for hardwood and low carpets,We bought this after readong the rave reviews and are very disappointed. It throws more dirt around then it cleans up..I have to dust mop after I vacuum. And yes - I read the directions to see if I was doing something wrong or not doing something and after checking everything out I am still going to get a new vacuum and hopefully find someone with no wood floors to clean to give this too. I would not buy this one again.
4,This vacuum works great!!!,"It works really good!!! I couldn't believe how much My old vacuum missed and this one picked up!! My two complaints about it is, its ""quite mode"" is no where near quite! AND I have animals so I am constantly having to clean the filter way too often because it loses suction alot, but other then that its a GREAT vacuum!! I do recommend it!"
5,"One of the best,works great, light weight.","I highly recommend this vacuum cleaner, it does a great job cleaning,and it's easy to use, and the price it's not bad either."
3,"Strong, but Big","We mainly have wood floors and jute-type area rugs, but we also have a very hairy dog. This Hoover does the job, has a fantastically long power cord, and is easy to clean out. My only complaint is that it's very, very heavy and difficult to maneuver."
5,:),Worked exactly as planned.PS--i loved the smiley face on my receipt[:will probably order more personals from this provider
1,Worst book ever....,"Clumbsy writting coupled with blantant racism doesn't make for an enjoyable read. If you are a black or white in an interacial relationship you will most likly be offended by this book. Apperently in the world of Eric van lustbader, Having [adult relations] with a black men means that you are some kind of rebel, also they should be used for [adult relations] as they are nothing more than caricatures with no real compacity for emotion or deep thought. I don't think this author has ever been around most black or hispanic people. I finished this book only becuase i started it. I would say burn this book ... but then you'd have to buy it. So save your money and run very far from this book. I wish i could give in negative stars."
5,Bible Study,"To follow the Torah portion each Saturday is a favored practice of mine. This volume is easy to use and read, besides giving words to reflect on, as I reflect on our Judeo-Christian Heritage."
4,Entertaining,"I bought this book because I'm a big fan of Jimmy Houston and of bass fishing. I thought the book was really entertaining, but the quality of the writing wasn't so good. If you like Houston's TV shows and magazine articles, you'll really enjoy this book. I think it would have been better if it was a little more organized, but it's still worth the money!"
2,Wrong book sent,"On Amazon.com shows new print of ""The Healing mind"" book, but I got old print and many topics missing."
1,Crochet Collection,"I also found this book a little out of date. I thought there was just too much ""stuff"" in it. I prefer doing doilys, afgans and some home decor things but this but was limited to that due to putting the silly stuff in like the rabbit (pg 111). It was not what I had expected. There was so much in the book there was no room for a variety of diffrent doilys.. you just have the 2 doily or so to choose from and then they move on. Just not my type of book."
4,Don't get the orange Rear.,"These meprolight sights are great. The one thing that I like about them over trijicons (which i also have) is that the tritium vials/white paint have a resin fill over them. This keeps your vials protected, and the white paint stays white and sharp.Green front sight was bright and crisp easily visible in the dark and low/moderate light conditions, the orange rear however, was pretty dim by comparison and only really visible in the dark. I was a little disappointed. If I could order again I'd go with the green/green which would be an easy 5 stars.Thanks for reading, I hope this helps with your decision."
3,OK,"I thought it was a ok movie but was my least favorite of them all. My 4 yr old absolutely LOVES it though and may be one of her favs other than Diamond Castle. I hate how alot of movies and toys now a days are all about looks, the style, high end accessories cell phones ipods ect. I refuse to buy Bratz or Liv dolls ect but my daughter loved this movie and thats all that matters."
1,Barbie A Fashion Fairytale,"This movie is not for four year olds. The contents of this movie is for teenagers dealing with breakups, losing jobs; etc."
1,So Sad and Disappointed,"My daughters and I have watched and purchased every Barbie movie they have made, and vowed that we would always watch them together even as they get older. Not sure we'll be doing that now after watching this movie. Why did they change the Barbie movies, when they were so good before? In this one, Barbie looks really weird, her voice is different (no more Kelly Sheridan), and the magic is gone. The previews for the next Barbie movie do not look good either (for Spring 2011). My girls and I are so sad at the end of the special Barbie movies that we have enjoyed all of these years. :("
1,Misleading,"This book is terrible. I have two cheif beefs with it. First, I can only vouch for my schoos but the book misleads leads you about it. First at Davidson (where I attend) there is no sensitivity training as the book claims, the faculty is not 95 percent liberal democrat, the core curriculium is not 10 courses but 12 and the humanities department is not under fire in fact it is one of the most uniformaly praised departments on campus. My second problem is with the tone of the author. The author finds fault with my school for offering classes on Africa, South America and gender related issues and for the presence of a sexual harresment code. This kind of anglo-male centric attitude and the devaliution of women and minorities that comes with it is not only offensive to those who think but dangerious"
4,Optimal Muscle Recovory,This is a good book. It puts more emphasize on cyclists.I would definitely recommend this for athletes.
5,Awesome!,"Not only is the band name catchy and edgy, but the songs are great. After getting hooked on Trend from watching it on MTV, I took a listen to the song samples on their record label site and was knocked out. This is definitely one that I will tell all my friends about."
4,Long overdue album from IMD's best kept secret,"Big Noyd drops his first album in years and it is right up there with Prodigy's H.N.I.C..The production is mainly handled by Alchemist & Havoc, but up & coming beatsmiths Emile and Sebb produce some of the best songs(Higher, The kid is nice, & Going right at em' w/ PMD). Noyd easily hold his own on every track and the guests make solid contributions, too. His whole fam gets down- Hav, P , & the Infamous Mobb.All of which, have been hitting the mixtape scene hard this year also check Alchemists' Insomnia mix + Cutting Room Floor c.d."
4,"she loved it, and thats what matters","i gave this necklace to my wife(new mother) for christmas and she loved it, it came in a small box with a built in frame that i put a small photo of her and my daughter in. thanks you, would buy from again!"
4,Casio Privia 575,"Very good keyboard for 600 dollars. But i must warn you, do not buy if you are not familiar with keyboards. This is not a toy."
1,This is my dumbest buy ever,"Item does not look at all as it is shown. It is just a cable with NO plubs! You can use it to tie something, cannot connect it to computer."
5,Remembered Indeed,"This DVD was a good idea. A collection of actors, actresses, and various crewmembers sharing their memories of working with Lucio Fulci.For fans this is great. Maybe boring to some, but over all, it was a wonderful idea for a unique artist. Rumored to be a Volume 2 in the works!"
4,4 stars for charmed:the book of shadows,it look very good and there are a lot of good artists in the cd and i like it.........and the one thing that i liked the most was that some of these songs was in charmed and i liked the songs from charmed
2,Cover looks to much like Iron Maiden....,i dont much like iced earth but the cover look oddly familiar. hmm maybe we have seen it before. im not sure. i know iron maiden has one that looks very close but i duno.
3,"Good, but not great","Being an avid listener of this style of music, I was slightly dissappointed with this CD. There are some really good tracks, but too much of non-memorable material. Also, I get a bit tired of the Paul Stanley (of Kiss) style vocals, but that's just me.If you collect Ice Earth, get this now! If you are just getting into this style, maybe start with something from Rhapsody, Blind Guardian or Stratovarius instead."
4,bob dylan's 30th,"the video is just as good as I remember it. However, the tape is so old it gets caught in the recorder each time I run it. I am afraid it will break. If I remember the ad it atated the tape was in good (maybe even excellent)condition. I paid a lot for something I have to worry about if I use it. Not such ""good condition""."
5,Very happy with them so far,I've only had these a week so I can't comment on how they hold up to frequent use/washing - but they look good! And they appear to be very solid and well made. I was worried they were going to be flimsy.
4,A good collection,"A good collection of essays writen after 9/11, worth reading. What prompts this review is the one and two star reviews running here. The usual hysteria from the usual gang of academics and naifs. Such reviewers love the insult even more than I. Bigoted, they write. Rightwing. Racist. Even Neo Con is strutted out, used as a pejorative, as if the reviewer knows what a Neo Con is, or was, which the reviewer clearly does not. Ignore the one or two star reviewers who are each and every one 'blame America' types, malcontents and Democrats all. Buy this book for your 'by the pool' or 'in the park' reading on current affairs."
2,Disappointing,"The chapter on General Sherman was great - but then he was one of my ancestors and I could be biased. The chapters are acollection of essays and do vary considerably.The other chapters were almost all were flawed because Hanson's polemic is based on much better understanding of the Classics and, to some degree, the West than the contemporary world or Islam. Sometimes this is clear because either the reasoning or overly broad conclusions are visible to a careful reader. Other times the neo Con bias informs the selection and presentation more subtly.Overall more pompous than profound."
5,Our Churchill,"""The Lord GOD has given me a well-trained tongue,That I might know how to speak to the weary a word that will rouse them.""-Isiah 50:4John Kennedy once said that Winston Churhill was able to ""mobilize the English language and send it into battle.""For the 9/11 generation, Victor Davis Hanson was able to fill that same role in the fall of 2001. The book is a collection of his essays that appeared in such publications as the National Review and the Wall Street Journal. It should be required reading for anyone still confused about what caused the attacks and unsure of what our response should be."
1,Where is the part about Midlife Crisis?,"Maybe my crisis is so intense I missed this topic on the book. I purchased this book in the attempt of finding some more information about men midlife crisis. But if you intend on buying this book for the same reason, don't.There's absolutely nothing valuable about the subject, and frankly, the fly-fishing part (almost everything else) is not even interesting. I'm not a fisher, but a well-written book will get your attention about any subject. This one is just a compilation of small autobiographical chronicles with doubtful choice of sequence.Perhaps good if you are a fly-fisher or want to know some meaningless political stories. If not, waste of time and money."
4,Thought Provoking!,Keen excels at extending the definition of processes and providing a structured Salience/Worth matrix approach of thinking about them. An important read for developing an understanding of processes and their role.
5,Boundaries with Kids,Book is in excellent condition and was on time. Thank you for a great product and great service.
3,it's ok...,"This is written from a VERY behaviorist point of view. While I appreciate the Christian based logic behind their strategies, I struggled to reconcile this with so much of my research in early childhood development development. I do like that the ""consequences"" suggested were not so much ""punishments"" but natural consequences of the child's choices. Overall, I am glad that I read it. Parenting books are meant to give us perspective and help us make our own decisions, not be brainless guides. For that, I am grateful."
3,Could've Been Butter,"This book was well written, and inspiring. However, after awhile it felt like I kept reading the same thing over and over again. The book could've been 100 pages shorter and i would've gotten the same thing out of it. Even though it was redundant, parts of it were fun to read and overall it was well written. I could see why it would want to make people start their own business. The main thing I got from this book was a craving for bread and butter."
4,The Key to Happiness in your Business,"This book, Bread and Butter, was a very uplifting story of how to gain happiness in your life while working. It shows you that you don't have to work at a business and be unhappy. It lets you know that you can be happy and enjoy what you are doing for your job. However, the book seems redundant, and seems repetitive with all of the information. Even with this quality of the book, it was still an unlifting story. Yummy... Bread and Butter!!!"
4,Show me the Bread!,"After reading this book, I really want to open my own bread company. (actually, I just want some bread). This book was inspiring and insightful into the different aspects involved in a business and in personal struggles. A little slow at parts but in general McMakin kept the juices flowing by introducing new characters who help paint the picture of this great bread company. Advice : keep bread handy while reading!"
5,Amazing Display,"Came in Perfect Conditions, no Dead Pixels, Very Bright Display, excellent Quality image while watching movies or TV with my tuner, good viewing angle, the best dislay i've had, i'm switching from a CRT ViewSonic Professional Series 17"", and i don't think i'll go back to my old Display"
5,Amazing Monitor!,"I am using this monitor as a T.V. for gaming and watching digital cable. In using a DVI-to-HDMI cable to watch T.V. and the Monster Cable Xbox 360 VGA cable, I have not experienced anything less then amazing. This is an outstanding gaming monitor; why pay +$400 for a 20in HDTV when you can buy this widescreen monitor for cheaper but still get better quality? Using a VGA cable for my Xbox 360, I play my games in 1080p on this monitor and the picture is perfect. Great product!"
3,High Rise - '2' (Squealer),"I've heard about this Japanese hard rock trio several times before,but this was my first time hearing their music.Despite the title of this disc,'2' appears to be their first effort.It's been noted that this band's main influences are two other power trios,that came before them,Cream and Blue Cheer.Line-up:Ahahito Nanjo-bass&vocals,Munehiro Nirita-guitar and Yuri Ujiie-drums.This CD didn't exactly blow my mind,but I thought it was okay.Fans of Vajra,Comets On Fire and Altered States might get more out of this CD than I did."
3,"average, what i expected for the price","8 shows, last about 3+ hours...black and white...throw back to old times...inane humor....the carnation milk ads and jingles playing over and over get on the nerves---solved by fast forward. nothing much to be excited over, mildly entertaining-old old jokes, dated humor, no real laughs"
4,It's the Little Things,"This book is set in the South - not only the Confederacy but South America. What makes this book special is the attention to detail the author brings to the topic. Many books have been written about this traumatic time in US history but this one examines the political involvement of other countries. Using a brother vs brother tale as his vehicle, Hart records the impact one foreign concern had on even the smallest confrontations. Be prepared to be amazed at all you will learn while enjoying the exploits of the Norton brothers."
3,Everything but a worthy heroine.......,"The history is excellent, the reality of the battles and the strategy planning, etc. is incredible. The hero's Ian Nortin, the union commodore and his half brother Robert, confederate cavalry are so different and yet each is the star of this book!They are the stuff hero's are made of and that makes this book a page turner. Our heroine is Countess Sophia who is a spy, murderess, adulterer and brazen . Why 2 men of such integrity and honor would fall hopelessly in love with her still leaves me confused. And for that reason I would rate this a 4-.....such a shame really because it is excellent in all other respects. The 'romance' part is also unreal because sophia and robert meet once and are hopelessly in love for the rest of the book...Kind of like the author thought there should be a love interest and threw it in. He even has her young daughter condoning her adulterous affair......The more I think of this, I'm only rating it a 3......sorry."
5,good stuff,"roger from across the pond saying hello. i must say i do like this album. it reminds me of a poet trying to do mathematical calculations with music. does that make any sense? it's very thoughtful. i would never have come upon this if not for the web -- what a wonderful world. enjoy the peace, friends."
4,Excellent acoustic.,"Restless is an excellent blend of acoustic guitar, cello and bass. The rhythms are somewhat Latin, but mellower. Very good music to sit and listen to on a quiet day while watching the clouds go by."
4,Collection of Artiles,".This book is more of a collection of articles written by practicing VCs/PE professionals.Many of the articles discuss either geographical, structural or practical issues in either LBO or Venture capital.A good collection.Borrow it from the local library rather than buying it."
3,"A vague, inarticulate tale",Sometimes McKillip writes the way I would talk if I had marbles in my mouth. This is one of those times.
4,"Wonderful, dream-like fairy tale","This one was pure poetry. Reminded me very much of Bradbury's Dandelion Wine, although a completely different story about a completely different season, almost like the other side of the coin. But the dream-like language casts the same evocative spell over the reader. This sort of story is hard to describe without giving too much away, but I will tell you it's about harshness of Winter, the pain of love, and way all things - good and bad - will eventually pass. There's a simple plot here, a love triangle, a tale of two sisters, one wild and one domestic, and a boy who comes between them, but for myself, I also found a deeper metaphor - the only way to know your true self, is to dream it."
1,tons of typo.....,"How can such a roughly edited book had ever been borned!!You can find errors almost on each page.The author provide the errata on the website of this book, but he left the rest for you to find."
2,Not as advertised,"I ordered this product because I have enjoyed wearing it over the years and it is difficult to find locally. However, when I received the product, it was not the 2.5 oz Cologne Spray. Instead, it was the 2.5 oz. Eau de Toilette spray which is much less concentrated and does not last as long. I should have known this from the price of the product, I suppose, but I thought perhaps it had come down in price. I won't make that mistake again. I'm an Amazon Prime member, so I do a lot of business with Amazon. This is the first time I've ever been disappointed in a transaction with Amazon."
5,Great durable product,"Worth every pennie, great price, one side fits my AR maxed out, other side fits 2 other guns maxed out 4 locks so little people can't open (children), a bit heavy when filled, but beats carring 3 seperates cases. Would definatly recommend this product!!!!"
5,required reading for musicians/teachers,"This book should be required reading for all musicians who teach, conduct, or otherwise guide the progress of other musicians. Dr. Jordan speaks about the unspoken: how we feel about the teaching we do and how our self-image impacts the quality of our teaching. We cannot do our best work (and neither can our students, musicians, etc.) if we do not accept ourselves because we cannot create a healthy environment. Dr. Jordan's work resonates deeply within all musicians who have been hard on themselves and their colleagues (which means all musicians!). His ideas have changed the way I teach, sing, and feel about all of it. I hope this book leads to further discussion on how musicians affect each other and themselves."
5,A Scholarly Study of the Passion Narrative,"The depth of Brown's scholarship is marvelous. Brown parses and analyzes each verse of every gospel story with insight and precision. It is a testament to his even-handedness that he draws criticism from the religious right as well as the avant garde iconoclasts who inhabit the left wing of modern Biblical scholarship. If you're looking for an easy read, look elsewhere. The student must invest a good deal of effort in reading and understanding this book, but the diligent student will find the reward well worth the extra effort."
2,Death of the Messiah,"This is a very scholarly, theologically oriented text. It is very dense and focuses on comparison of different biblical texts, language interpretations and corroboration through ancient literary works or histories. It is not the inspirational or devotional text I was seeking, but may be a delight to serious student of theology and biblical studies."
5,Outstanding Product!,"I don't normally write reviews, but absolutely blown away with how easy and fast this was to use. I am the drummer in a blues band and used this tuner right before taking my kit to a gig. Tuning with the drum dial made my drums sound so much better, I immediately got comments from the rest of the band asking what on earth I did to make my drums sound so much better. It was as is if I had brought a new drum kit! I could not be happier with this purchase. Excellent product!"
1,Poor reproduction quality,"The quality on this DVD is poor. It looks like it was transferred from VHS. The sound is OK, but video is poor. Video quality is consistent, color is fair."
5,WESTERN EXCELLENT,"CANT UNDERSTAND WHY MURPHEY WESTERNS HAVE BEEN LOST TO TV HE WAS VERY GOOD THE ONES I SEE ALL HOLD UP, AS DOES THIS ONE ALSO SOME EXCELLENT EXTRA ON THIS"
5,ring with harmony,the greatest selection ever. the brothers did a wonderful job with this one. just do more like it.
4,CLARINS MEN SMOOTH SHAVE,CLARINS MEN SMOOTH SHAVE IT'S IDEAL FOR THOSE WHO HAVE A SENSITIVE SKIN.PREVENT'S IRRITATION OF YOUR FACE SKIN AND PRESENTS A SMOOTH FRAGANCE.ONE OF MY FAVORITES AT SHAVING.
1,Stupid from beginning to end. Shirley obviously NOT a nun.,How stupid do they think we are? Terrible movie that is simply stupid from beginning to end. Only good part is the theme music by Lalo Schifrin (Mission Impossible).
3,what happened to Shirley's grunts and moans?,"I watched this recently on the Westerns channel, and at 3 points in the film--twice when he's hoisting her up and once at the end when the tub water splashes over his hat--Shirley MacLaine gives out with these very un-nun-like exclamatory vocalizations. Right after this viewing--to replay one of the more violent scenes--I played the DVD and...NOT ONE OF THE 3 IS ON THE SOUNDTRACK! What happened, Universal?"
3,Excellent product but missing few features,"Excellent product but missing few features, the product is excellent, but i live in Chicago area where we have very high wind speeds, the grill cover is missing some velcro straps or additional strings/straps to avoid the cover from flying out when we have high winds :("
4,grill cover,This is a great grill cover for the money. It works just fine for my Char-Broil grill. It also looks good
1,Fading away...,My cover has been installed since mid May and the color has already faded to a dirty gray. None of the blue remains. The cover is also very short leaving a bit over a foot of grill exposed. And it leaks. I doubt that it will survive the summer. Be warned....
4,Good Grill Cover,This is a good grill cover. It's a little short for my Charbroil Commercial Series grill. Other than that it fits fine. The color fades really quickly when exposed to the weather.
5,Great CD,I think this is a great CD by Eddie Money. My favorite song is Calm before the Storm. He has a great voice.
5,Outstanding,I have received the Plumbing 1-2-3 and found it to be outstanding. I have used the book to complete the plumbing within my new 80X50 steel building. This book saved me time and money! Great!
2,lack details,i was hoping to get little more information on some of the specific topics that I didnot find in this book.
5,I checked it out of the library 3x - & bought my own copy,"Previous reviewers have already summarized the more obvious qualities of this book; I agree with their comments. I found that for the student of Chinese culture, Chinese education, or Chinese thought, the book is a stunning introduction to a way of expressing observations and meaning in compact forms. In particular, the poetry seems both denser and more graceful than similar forms in English poetry, and more complex than the haiku forms descended from it. Chinese speakers I know vouched for the sensitive transliteration.Basho advised a haiku student to ""read Chinese poetry"" to write better haiku. I came to this work after struggling with haiku for a long time. I found Basho's advice to be good and this book to be a remarkable way to begin. The historical text snippets offered with the poems make further reflection easy without attempting to ""define"" all that the poem means."
1,How much for shampoo?,Bleeding heck - why pay more than a buck for shampoo .... unless you're really trying to bankrupt yourself? (my wife apparently is).
4,Historical masterpiece,"This book is a fluid-dynamics masterpiece. Maybe it's a little bit outdated now, but it's the book two or three generations of fuid scientists (30s-50s) used during their studies. Definitely a must-have for the serious theoretical fluid dynamicist, not the right book if you're looking for computational methods."
2,A university-level text with little on aviation.,"The title is misleading, as there is very little useful info on aeromechanics. If you are into balloons using coal gas or hydrogen, buy this book. As a university-level reference work, the section on vortices is useful. For homebuilding aerodynamics, the book is of little use."
3,"Good, but not long lasting","I bought this for last christmas (so just under a year ago). It fits well, looks great, but after about 4-5 wearings, the boning has lost a lot of its support and shape. Also some of the boning is starting to poke through at the top. Decent corset for the price, but not one for longevity"
2,So much potential,it was really pretty and looked great opening it up. I'm a 32 and when I put it on it was too big. Reversing it did not look right either. It looked like it wasn't made for reversing. I ended up returning it.
1,Wrong size.,"I wear a size 32 and they sent Me a size 38.I cannot wear this and I really wanted the correct size.Now, when ups came to retrieve it I was not home and they have not came back since so, I still have a corset sitting here that I cannot wear. They were supposed to retrieve it so I can be refunded sine they can't replace it that way. In order for Me to get the right size, I would have to reorder a new one through amazon. This is a huge inconvenience."
3,Too large in bust =/,"The corset is beautiful, really sturdy and well made. Although, the photo does show a straight cut across the top, while the actual product has more of a sweetheart neckline instead--still, very pretty, and this is not my main complaint. The issue is that it's very loose in the bust. I am a 32 C, and since a 32 is the smallest size available (and another review stated that ordering a size smaller hadn't worked for them), that is what I ordered. I have the back synched as tightly as possible without the edges overlapping and wore a strapless pushup bra underneath, and there is still quite a bit of space in the bust. It fits the rest of me well enough (still a bit big), and a size down probably would have been best if it were available."
3,Great but poor fit,"The shipping was early and service was great. I am a 34 and the waist fit perfectly, but the bust is quite big and I was unable to fit into it. Great looking, but I had to return it because of size. I would say the 34 would fit a C or D cup size."
2,Beautiful corset... but NOT fully reversible,"This is a beautiful corset. My fiance loved it, but sadly, it didn't fit. She wears a 32 already and since a 32 is the smallest it comes it wasn't a good fit. Also, it is NOT fully reversible. It's very well lined, but you can't just flip it inside out and wear it that way. Not unless you want the tag to show and the hooks and eyes to show."
4,Beautiful with learning curve,"This is a beautiful corset, well made and true to size IF you understand how corsets are sized. Measure your waist and subtract four inches for good fit.The corset has moderate boning and has sturdy construction for cinching. My only issue with it is that the cinching ribbons are too short, but if you spend a few dollars to replace them, it is a lovely, quality corset. Here's a video showing how to properly put on and cinch a corset: [..]BTW, it is fully reversible, and the garters are removable. It's worth twice the asking price, and beautiful."
5,Work great,These were a little to narrow for our window but still work great. I like that they have the draw string cord instead of clips to hold it up. Just tuck the cord up high if you have little ones.
1,Temporary and standard light,I prepped the surface with rubbing alcohol only to find them laying on the floor within the first five days of installation. The darkening effect is no better than the vertical blinds currently installed on the other windows.I won't be purchasing these again.
3,Every effort can't change the world.,"No one is a bigger Dylan fan than I (40 years and counting). However, those reviewers who claim that this cd would have been well received if produced by anyone but BD miss the point.It grieves me to say that this presently is not; nor ever was, a particularly good cd.And I would say that even if the writer, singer and producer were Joe Blow and not BD.So pass on. Nothing to be gained here."
2,Not Dylan,"I don't know if Dylan sobered up or what for this but I am thoroughly disappointed. I own almost every other Dylan album and consider Bob to be the best with 15 of his albums in my top 100. I have put off buying this one because I knew it was going to be bad or at least bad for Dylan. Even the cover picture is a little weak. My preconceptions were all correct and I wish that I hadn't spent the three dollars from the vinyl bin at a local bookstore.If you really want all the Dylan albums much like me, don't expect much. It isn't as bad as any Winger album but it is probably, in my humble opinion, the worst Dylan album and should be the last one that any fan should buy."
1,review,"I knew I was getting a used book, but when I actually got it, it was about ready to fall apart it was so used. I am disappointed that I paid $7 for such a tattered book"
2,Unmotivating,"I was trying to make the most of my time by listening to these CDs while commuting to and from work. I found the first CD uplifting, but when I went on to listen to the second one, I quickly became lost in a never-ending series of lists of 7 reasons for this, 6 ways to look at that, 3 factors of something else, etc. It became so confusing and demotivating that I just quit right there and haven't gone back."
3,fly shocks disappointing,"I purchased a Timberline-4 15 years ago and it is still working fine. However, I bought a second one 2 years ago and what a difference in quality. the shock cords on fly are fine on the old tent but already frayed and ruined on the new tent. The quality of this tent has definitely fallen."
2,Half way,"I think I began reading this book because someone recommended it to me and I left it half way. I don't even remember what it is about. Something about a girl running away from her home in Mexico with a lot of cash. Anyway, I think it was well written, it is not my cup of tea."
2,Mediocre,"Patterson doesn't offer much more than thesis and spends most of the time celebrating himself or theorizing about some ancient Egyptian tribe and their beliefs.For Gurdjieff experts this is not worth a look, beginners will be much better off with his own books or Ouspensky's ""Search for the Miraculous"". I was deeply disappointed."
5,wonderful fragance,I bought this product last year from amazon. This perfume has very sweet and long lasting. I recommend it. Wonderful perfume.
4,Cute and soft.,Very cute and soft plushy otter. Cuddly and stands up well to taking baths in my HE washing machine. Great quality for the price.
3,Ghost in a Teeny Bikini - The movies,It's stupid and corny and great all in one. It's a typical B rated soft porn movie but the best part is Beverly Lynne. Her acting is classic in this movie.
4,quilting tools,"Fast ship, nice price, love the razor sharp scissors. Rotary cutter gets dull fast, mat is not a self healing mat. Good beginning set, but if you plan on using this every day go for a better brand."
5,"Informative, entertaining and gift-worthy.","""Lust, Love and Longing"" by Eileen Morgan satisfied me on many levels, the scholarly, the aesthetic, and the sybaritic. It covers all bases from the history of lust and the great lovers and objects of desire to the more mundane subject of ""how the birds and bees do it."" Included are well-chosen illustrations and pictures, all evocative of the theme. ""Lust"" could be used as a reference book or as an inspiration."
3,Good but a bit repetitive,"As a new convert to vinyl, it was interesting to see how really addicting collectingVinyl can be for some folks, A little more info about the process would have beenHelpful. More imfo about collecting, famous venues etc would have been great."
4,Ride the grooves.,"This book made me break into a grin-and-nod combo more than once in recognition (frequently scaring other subway passengers). No matter. Reading about others chasing the elusive high of the vinyl dragon was comforting - and totally entertaining.I also liked the fact that this book that this book bemoaned the rarity of female collectors (Crumb's quote, ""it never gets them hot,"" is hilarious). I'm one of those rarities myself (26 and trolling flea markets for records since I was 9 or 10), so it was interesting -if not really particularly surprising - to find out there's not a lot of us out there. ""There's not many women who want to sit around and debate the best Elvis Costello album"" line made me laugh, too - `cause I do!I'd recommend this for anyone who's ever collected anything - you're likely to find kindred spirits within these covers."
4,Interesting music,"This is an interesting collection of Dowland's Lute songs in a format that presents the song in standard notation (classical guitar format) and also in tablature. As with most Dover Publications, it is well-bound with a sturdy cover, but the paper the music is printed on is of low quality."
4,Giant rc = top fun (OUTDOORS ONLY),"THis is one giant RC truck. It runs over most things no worries about that!! can do mud, snow (packed) or less than 3 inches deep. grass, logs, gardens and jumps. All top fun!!Pretty robust unit for the money too, recommended for all, get 2, they have a switch on the transmitter so you can race multiple. The body shell comes off like a hobby grade car too."
1,Secret Message? Maybe. Jesus? No.,"Seems I already heard a lot of these theories and 'novel' ideas in my college 'new testament as literature' and 'religious philosophy'courses. The instructor at this Maryland university was a modernist progressivist mainline revisionary who made us all question our beliefs about what 'Jesus really meant' for the modern mind. If this book and all who it speaks for is emergent christian theology for popular consumption or appealing to the disaffected children of evangelicals, Biblical literacy and Kingdom Truth in the Person of Jesus-as-Deity-on-a-Roman-Cross are more seriously compromised than imagined."
1,gneo-gnostic gnonsense,"The title says it all, although the book itself is cause for alarm.Yes, the Lord did teach in parables, but he explained everything to his disciples. These disciples in turn gave us the rest of the New Testament to elaborate what Jesus meant by ""Kingdom of God"".This is where Mcclaren is way off base. He limits his ideas to the Sermon on the Mount, parables of yeast and seed, etc. When an author is spot off, it shows everywhere in all he says and believes and passes off on others.Secret Message? We need Mcclaren to decode it for us.Uncovering the real Truth? We need also Dan Brown's Davinci Code to get at the hidden facts behind conservative evangelical creeds & confessions.That could Change Everything? This neo-gnostic gnonsense will only change those who have largely abandoned the Gospel of the Crucified Messiah who shed his blood to pay for our sins and earn the right to be the planet's Chief Justice on Judgment Day."
2,My first time,"It was my first book to read of brian...and I was hoping for something more...The reason i gave it two stars is because he came on strong with this secret and approached as a person seeking answers, but always seemed to have the answers...Plus it was nothing new...I have been in the church for 13 years and it is all the same messages I have heard...good stuff...but no secret...not that i expecated one...I will propably give his books one more shot"
5,One of the best books I have ever read,Brian McLaren's book the Secret Message of Jesus is one of the best books I have ever read. Brian gets it and he helps others get it as well. This book is for those who are truly on a spiritual quest and can't be satisfied by religiosity and legalism. If you have ever thought that there has to be more to life? Then this book is for you.
5,Baby Loves it!,Bought this for our little boy. He absolutely loved it to where he had to hold onto this thing where ever he went LOL. Like it was a safety net for him or something. Couldn't be more pleased with the product and holds up really well to a baby and teething :)
5,Love the set and this plate,"I've bought several items from this line as gifts and they all are lovely. Great look, clean up great, and durable. Used for serving snacks or family style appetizers. Would buy again!Would highly recommend the matching set!Villeroy & Boch New Wave Cottage 6-Piece Serving Set"
2,not for teens,"i bought this because i wanted a new cologne for myself it finally got in the mail today( before i ordered it i did read it was for mature men, im 16, and i didnt listen to the reviews) i used one spray on my wrist and instantly i got a sent of flowers/ or old church. this definantly reminds me of old men, so i deffinantly dont recomend this cologne to anyone under atleast 35."
5,Great set for home,This is a great tool set for a woman for the home. It is neat and compact yet has most tools that someone may need.
2,Weak Screwdriver & missing regular screw drivers,"This set is quite cute and good for light home repair, such as hanging pictures. The electric screwdriver is far to weak to be used for much else than screwing in pre-threaded holes (such as computer repair). I tried this weekend to use it to repair a closet door system and the screwdriver wasn't strong enough to screw into the wall (even though there was a smaller hole pre-drilled.)The hammer is little, but sometimes that's all you need. I would also have liked to see a regular sized phillips and flat-head screwdriver in the set. Otherwise, the case fits together nicely, everything stays in place even after owning it for over a year."
3,It's Ok but dont expect great quality.,"I use this for very basic stuff around the house and for little craft projects, but keep in mind that the quality is pretty low.Don't expect it to stand up to any actually household maintenance.Even though its not the best out there, you get what you pay for. At Least it deals with all the small things I use it for."
1,Not good news. Its not compatible with Australian Power sockets,Can't use the screw driver. I never knew it wont plug in to australian sockets and an adapter wont work either. Returning it cost $80 Aus and its illegal to post batteries. There goes that!
3,Nice Handy Set,"This is a nice 135 piece set for everyday use, the power driver is not that powerful but enough though for quick easy things.Grip for the tools is nice too."
3,No drillin',The only problem I had was that the drill never worked; and due to a family issue I didn't find out till way later. So I'm stuck with a non working drill. Everything else is fine...
2,"Pretty, but Useful?","I wasn't knocked out by this deck. It's a brilliant idea, and the artwork is pretty. However, the significance of the images is less than clear. OK, so you turn one upside down and maybe it's green instead of purple and the person pictured looks less excited. Not quite the significance on which one can hook meanings that I would prefer.You might want to discount what I say, as I admit that I tend to resist learning yet-another set of attributions. Lazy perhaps. You may delight in learning yet-another set of attributions. And probably many folks don't use them as divining tools.Collectors will probably love it. Some readers may like it a lot. Alas, I was not one of them."
2,Paper not HARDCOVER - problem order,"I recevied the boxed set but the book is not ""hardcover"" as advertised. I'm also having to contact the manufacturer because the deck was not complete. It was sealed, but missing most of the wands and contained duplicates of several minor cards. I was diappointed to find Amazon does not handle the problem themselves by just sending a new boxed set. The set looks good, but I will reconsider purchases from Amazon in the future because of their reurn policy. I don't want to return, I want by order corrected."
3,What your boss doesn't tell you book review,"Not a lot new in this book. It focuses most on correcting really dysfunctional behavior, not on subtle defects."
3,Survey of destruction...,"Healtwole presents a county-by-county account of Sheridan's movements in the Valley. The ""witness"" to the destruction is the use of ""facts"", legends, interviews, family letters, etc. A flaw is the generalized sameness of each chapter - ""these"" troops, led by ""this"" guy did ""that"" to ""those"" peoples barn, house, etc. While there is certainly many interesting anecdotes and sidebars without, the format becomes repetitive. Indeed, if you read three or four chapters, you get the full gist. The abundance of maps helps."
2,Just OK,"I actually have one of these in my ATV hauler camp trailer and it works great, but we bought this one for our enclosed trailer that is smaller but all open and it doesn't heat it very good."
1,Over priced and poorly packaged,"This sounded like a good deal, but after I ordered these, I found a 72 peat pellet refill kit at Home Depot which was much cheaper per pellet, and that kit was neatly packaged with four individual trays."
2,Surrealistic and dark. That's all..,"Yes. i admit that this one is a surrealistic, experimental, dark film far from the other Alice-related movies. But all those things does not prove that it deserves to be praised. What i could find in this movie is that a vague plot, bizarre characters and a weird sound. That's all. Even puppet-animation failed to catch my mind (I am a big fan of that method). Instead of it, i'd like to recommend BBC's TV version directed by Jonathan Miller and/or 'Dreamchild' to people who are interested in more creative, dark version than normal Alice movies."
2,A decent experimental film,"Being a sucker for stop-motion animation, I purchased this DVD on a whim. While it does have it's moments of greatness, a majority of the movie just left a bad taste in my mouth.The animation is brillliant, but the constant cut to the girls mouth is really jarring, and quite a bit annoying when you see it for the 10th time.The short film that is included on this DVD is the better part of this DVD, IMHO."
1,Bad...film...taking up...valuable...brain space...must purge,"The treatment of Alice in Wonderland is overshadowed by the grotesque nightmare of the White Rabbit. A stuffed rabbit gets bug eyes, and rips itself free of its display case, and takes off. It is one of the most ghastly things I have ever seen.The dialog and narration is minimal, almost making this a silent film, which adds nothing to the story, indeed making it very hard to follow. Especially since this film is full of symbolism. In fact, if you take out the ""said the White Rabbit,"" et. al, there would hardly be any dialog throughout the first 3/4 of the film.The sound is harsh and low quality, with sound effects overly dominating each scene.The best part of the film is when Alice is turned into a doll, and the doll is animated. The treatment and cinematography is very consistent, making our ability to relate to the doll as the character very easy.Overall, a waste of time, but is probably a lot of fun on an altered brain chemistry."
4,Revelation: the ew American Commentary,This is an easy book both to read and to understand. Thanks to Dr. Patterson for taking the time to research and write it.
5,Unfaultering Passion for Young People,"For anyone that works with or cares about young people, this is a must read, like Manchild in the Promised Land and There are No Children Here. In a simple to read form, this book tells a towering story of one man's inspiring drive to make the world a better place, starting with our young people. From his work in South Central LA, Lou Dantzler's story reaches out and looks to touch all of our communities."
3,Not the Best in the Series!,"My kids love E.B. books and were quite happy reading/solving the first few. Then our school required this one for a book club. Turns out these are really pretty obscure and harder to solve. Also, Idaville and E.B. have moved to a weird parallel universe. My 8 year old & I both want to know what a ""computer museum"" is, as apparently Idaville now has one. While I applaud an attempt to update the books, the mysteries aren't as fun or as solvable. Really, it was easier to explain some of the antique stuff (what's a gasoline can?) than to understand the updates."
5,Great first reader,"My 5-year old granddaughter started kindergarten this year. ""Biscuit Goes to School"" is the first book she has ever read by herself. Just the right mix of sight words and phonetics, and a nice story. She loves dogs and this held her interest, so I intend to get more Biscuit books. Oh yes .... and she is autistic so this is a very significant achievement for her."
1,Not worth it,"This book looks like it was published in the guy's basement. Pretty worthless info...just tossed together. No pictures. No graphs. Just information you could have guessed and figured out for yourself. Yes, it IS cheaper to live in Thailand. Duh."
2,PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE SHOTTING,"Just a heads-up to those thinging about these cameras. DON'T USE THEM FOR ANY IMPORTANT PHOTOS! These cameras are used cases with new film added. I don't not recommed them, they are cheap, but be aware. I've had problems with 2 different cameras(I probably wouldn't buy again, but maybe), and wish I'd read a review like this before taking them to Mardi Gras...oh well, who wants to remember a swamp tour in an fan boat anyway."
2,Investigation?,"I picked up this book thinking that I would be reading about recent sightings of UFOs and the ongoing investigations. Unfortunately, that is most certainly not the case. The only recent events talked about are the movie Independence Day and the joint promotion they did with Nevada.Susan Wright has merely collected many well-known people, investigations, theories, and events from the past and mentioned them all here. There are many other books that give this to you, so this one does not help. Also, the narrative seems to skip from point to point without a logical order.If you know absolutely nothing about UFOs, their investigations, and conspiracy theories to cover them up, then you might read this to become familiar with the people and places. Otherwise, I would recommend investing your time elsewhere."
3,Not his father,"Duwayne Burnside is a first rate guitarist and a mediocre singer. I have seen him in person and loved his show. However, he does not translate well when recorded. By all means, go see him live but otherwise, Under Pressure is for fans only."
5,Outdoor grill cover,I couldn't be happier with my new outdoor grill cover. Recently we had several days of rain - the cover was unaffected - it performed better than expected and I would buy it again and again.
3,Nice grill cover...,"This is a very nice looking and sturdy grill cover... however, if you live in a windy area it will need to be modified. We live in NW Arkansas it is not windy all the time but the cover has blown off twice in the last month... it is more of an inconvenience than anything. Now we use bungee cords to hold it on now... I am considering running a cord through the bottom that we can tie off."
4,Great Cover,"Though the color is off from the picture, I like it better. It is more of a toupe/olive color. It is made for a 63"" wide BBQ so it won't hang right if yours is not as wide. It is heavy material and seems to be well sewn. Only had it a month but am pleased with it."
4,Best cover I could find,"As mentioned, the color is slightly off from the picture, but not a big deal to me. I've had mine for a year now, and the ""green"" part has faded to the same color as the tan, so it's not like the color even matters anymore.My deck is completely exposed, so I needed something to cover almost the whole grill to keep the destructive sun and rain off my grill. This does the trick. It's water-tight. No matter how hard the rain, the grill stays dry below.I will say that despite the heavy weight of the cover, it does blow off the grill sometimes during stronger winds--maybe once a month. Not too big a deal, it never goes far. Sometimes if the weather is especially windy I'll secure it with bungees. I guess some built-in securing device like a cord or strap would have helped, but then the cover wouldn't be as easy to take off when I need to.I'll buy another cover like this one when my current cover wears out."
4,Good Cover,this is a well made product. The material is instantly recognizable as durable and mine ( I bought 2) are well stitched together. Color variations were not noticable nor particularly important to me as I simply wanted something to effectively protect the grill from the elements as it lives outside year round.I do wish it was a bit longer though from the top to the bottom as rain is able to splash on to the base and wheels of the grill. Still it is great cover
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I was not expecting a whole lot for $20 but needed 2 for 2 grills. Out of the box it felt sturdy. I'm not sure why others had color issues, though perhaps there was another run that had poor color. I could care less what color it was, but it is a Kelly green. I feel better that the PA snow won't eat away at my stainless steel grills. And I expect this to last several seasons. Not thin like some of the cheaper black vinyl covers I've had in the past. Exterior feels almost canvas-like, with a smooth vinyl interior."
3,Should be longer,"Love the color-but my grill apparently is taller than a charbroil, so it is too short. Other than than it is great."
4,Good Cover,I bought this cover to cover a new grill I recently bought. The cover seems very well made repels water very well and is easyto clean. I have owned this cover for a few months now and I can recommend it to anyone looking for a well made cover at a fair price.
5,BBQ Grill Cover,I was looking for a high quality cover for my Weber Grill. This product is very well made and is highly durable! I am very satisfied with this purchase and the price was a bargin. I would highly recommmend this product if you are looking for adurable grill cover.
2,did not taste like the one we bought in Costco,"this candy was ok, but it had a different taste than the one we had previously bought at Costco, even though it was supposed to be the same flavor. But, the one in Costco said ""new improved recipe"" perhaps this one was the old recipe. I was disapointed. But the quality of the candy was fine. Just not the same as the one I already had. So, this candy is not being eaten any nearly as fast.This candy was a brighter red color, and not as soft. However, this candy did have a stronger strawberry flavor."
1,dont buy it!,"I'm a seroius eishin ryu iaijutsu practioner and i say that this bokken is a piece of junk! if you really want to practice use a white oak bokuto! plus the tsuba slides off and does'nt fit even if you do put on the rubber stopper!!!!!!!Buddy Smith(first dan black belt in taekwondo and practioner of eishin ryu iaijutsu, and judo)"
3,necklace is beautiful,i had this item under my wishlist&my friend got it 4me however necklace is very pretty the nice looking gift box it comes in was ruined due to the way it was packed which sucks when im wanting to give this to my mother im not wanting to give her what use to be a pretty box to a destroyed broken giftbox=[
2,Pretty necklace: SHORT chain....,This necklace is darling but the chain is extremely short. I placed it on my 6 year old's neck to get an exact idea about the length because it was choking me. It looked like it was made for a child lengthwise after seeing it on my own child. I had to take the necklace apart and add another extender to the other side of it so I could wear it comfortably.
4,Grease is the Word! But it has never been updated!,"This is the original score and has never been updated. While the piano score is identical to the current score from Samuel French, the vocals are different. I have now directed the show twice, and this score is perfect for preparing choreography and accompanying rehearsals, but it CAN NOT be used to teach the score -- the Samuel French rental music now comes with the correct vocal accompaniment (example, Alone at the Drive-In Movie now has extensive backup parts for the Burger Palace Boys -- those are not included in the original score)."
3,Demark needs to make his books for the average trader,I am a fan of Demark's indicators if you or I can ever get them. His indicators are only given to high dollar companies like reuters. My reading of this book was a painful process of trying to understand a indicator I cannot even use in trial applications. IT is clear that Demark has left his loyal following to make up bargin basement Metatrader indicator rejects. Like most in this business.....business comes first. I rank this has a 3 and the only reason it got a three was because of the quality of the work. Demark is really only valued by the traders who honestly don't need him to trade like myself. If I was a rookie and pick up one of his books I would not trade the markets because of the over don't explanation and indicators I could not follow. Do not read the reviews folks. They seem real suspect. Make a simple explanation book Demark and make your real indicators available.
3,Difficult reading sometimes confusing but may have value,"I am just finishing reading this book which was difficult reading mostly because there is a lot of detail and also because the authors insist on repeating themselves to state the vice versa case. What was particularly bothersome was there was no information on the back-testing of the indicators so the reader is left guessing to the value of any particular indicator. I also sometimes found it difficult to find in the charts given the example the chart was suppose to show in terms of qualified and disqualified indicators etc. Still there is still value in this book especially in the indicators given towards the end of the book, if you can hang in there that long. I will try and apply these to my trading and then I will know if there is any value to this book."
4,The end of the line,"This would be the last album by the original ELO. It hit #49 in 1986, the year of the hair bands. Jeff Lynne must of known that this would be the last record after dropping several hints in music rags prior to it's release. Only 1 hit of this disc ""Calling America"" #18, this is a very good song with a nice guitar part in the middle. ""Heaven Only Knows"" is one of my favorites on this CD. ""Endless Lies"" has a 50's sound to it, ""Is it Alright"" is a good little tune also. The ballad ""Getting to the Point"" seems to be Jeff's way of saying goodbye to ELO with these lyrics ""It's getting to the point where nobody can stop it now it's getting to the point of no return and all that i can do is stand and watch it know watch it burn,burn,burn"" This disc should be in every ELO collection, it may not be their best, but it is still a great cd."
5,The Light Runs Out For ELO,ELO's Balance Of Power Was the band's final album and the rock is gone and replaced by drum machines and synthesizers and was music was in 1986 after this album bombed ELO broke up and hung up thier insturments and moved on the legacy was gone and by winter 1986 ELO offically Disbanded.
5,Great Kit,Love this Maintenance Cleaning Kit. Great Job on this one. Will order again when this runs out. I highly reconmend this!
4,TONY - ONE GREAT SINGER,This is a great album - the essential Tony Bennett. It does miss a few good tunes such as IF I RULED THE WORLD and one of his favorites - When Joanna loved me.
5,Great characters,After you are introduced to all the characters then the story takes off. It is easy to follow each person & how they fit in the story. I have enjoyed all of Cramer's books.
1,Too Promiscuous,"My husband started me reading Lawhead and up until Patrick, I enjoyed his writing. We are very careful on the content of what we read and Lawhead had, thus far, been very morally clean. However, within the first 50 pages he includes lewd details of sexual relationships. I do not know anything about the historical Patrick, but this information was not necessary at all. If it had stopped I might not be writing this review, but the sexual promiscuity continues throughout the book in detail. While I very much enjoyed Hood and Scarlet as well as the Pendragon Cycle, I have nothing good to say about Patrick. Even the theology is loose and liberal. It made me wonder if Lawhead has changed what he believes. In the end, Patrick was a disappointment."
2,Patrick got short changed here....,"Just to add my two cent worth, if this book was part of a trilogy, I can rate this book higher but as it is, the story feel totally incomplete. As a reader, I felt slightly cheated when the book closed out. If this book was suppose to be a historical novel about St. Patrick of Ireland, the author totally missed his mark. What so funny is that until the end of the book, this character had several names but never Patrick!! I enjoyed Stephen Lawhead books, his Byzantium is quite excellent but this book needs more pages or more books tell the story correctly even in a fictional form. Main character in this book, is no more son of Ireland then panda bear! Lawhead has written far superior books then this."
4,PATRICK,This is a very good example of Stephen Lawhead's work. I have read many of his books and was well satisfied with this book.
4,overlooked FPS of the 90's,"I remember this game. Infact I still have it stored away somewhere. It was a futuristic FPS where you could play as 3 different players (a man, a woman and some sort of alien). It stole ideas from the other FPS it was competing with sure, but this one stood out from all the other clones. A decent storyline. If you're a fan of 90's FPS then you gotta find this title. A big bonus is the game had a REALLY creepy soundtrack then is available to be listened to when you pop the CD in your stereo."
1,Hard and Scratchy Sheets,"I don't recommend buying the fitted sheet that goes with the Peek a Pooh crib set. It's hard and scratchy, even after washing. And, it's not a very attractive pattern. Instead, I went out and bought plain, knit sheets that are much softer and look better."
1,leaked from first fillup,leaked not from the actual spout but from the seam where the wall meets the top. total POS.
5,wish I had sent this book to my mom,This Mother's Day 1999 I received this book and it is filled with wonderful thoughts about mom. The art work is great. So many things I wish I had thought to tell mom all in one tiny book.
2,Not Well Made,"This is an inexpensive toaster. And as it has been said ""You get what you pay for"". It is not made well at all, and does not toast the bread well either. The toast is not evenly toasted and in general does not perform well. I would not recommend it."
4,Nice to see Michael happy,"Growing up in the 80's there were two groups I semi-worshipped (and still do); R.E.M. and Haircut 100.Oops, the latter was supposed to read U2. (insert rim shot here)Anyways, I was lucky enough to see U2 a few times and they always put on a good, lively, interested show. I was only able to see R.E.M. once (Monster Tour), and I was sadly disappointed. They sounded pretty great, but Mr. Stipe was disinterested. He sang half the songs with his back to the audience and seemed as though he wanted the show over with asap.Maybe I caught him on a bad night, but at least I have this dvd to fall back on when I want to see an R.E.M. that I always wished I'd seen live. He is upbeat, smiling, mingling with the audience AND they (and the dvd) look and sound great. My only complaint is the total lack of any HC100 covers.I recommend this dvd to any old or new R.E.M. fan. It's $11.99 at Best Buy this week so pick it up."
1,White Horse Inn,"This is not a good compilation selection CD, although the one Alfred Drake piece is very good. There used to be a very fine Angel recording of this show; too bad that it is no longer available. Come on Amazon, search it out and re-issue it. You've got at least one buyer here."
5,Works great !,"Yes this starter works great on our 1985 Dodge Ram 50, 2.0 liter. I saved $30.00 to $40.00 bucks from the auto parts stores. Amazon delivered the starter in good time even with super shipper. And no shipping costs."
4,Got rid of my spider mite problem,"Started up nearly a hundred seedlings and I could see red spider mites popping up everywhere. I sprayed this 3-in-1 all over and have not seen any bugs near my plants for nearly two weeks now after the one application. Seemed to be okay for using on tomatoes, eggplant, peppers, green onions. No noticeable bad side effect. Wouldn't hesitate to use again if needed."
4,Works,Used this on some roses that we have that get ants every year. Once the ants arrived I gave them a good spray with this stuff and no more ants. It's been 2 weeks now and still no problem.
3,Didn't help mildew,"I LOVE that this is a safer, not-crazily-toxic product. I try to use green whenever I can on my garden, especially for edibles. My cucumber was having problems with both mildew and bugs this year, so I thought this might be a way to take care of both at once. While it did seem to take care of the bugs, the mildew continues. The plant is still alive and making cucumbers, but not as healthy as it could be because of the issue. So I'd recommend this for bugs and possibly other problems, but not for a mildew issue."
3,Soap and sulfur spray,"Amazon page does not list the active ingredients. They are potassium salts of fatty acids 0.75%, and sulfur 0.40%. So far, I tried on on small insects such as thrips. I haven't tried on heavy-infested plants because it is too early for the season. I think the spray works on contacts with the insect, and not for preventive measure. By the way, don't forget to shake well before spraying."
4,I like Safer Products,I am excited to be able to try this Safer product. I have used alot of their stuff in the past and have been very pleased with the results. The fact that this is a 3 in 1 spray saves room on my gardening shelf. I haven't had any gardening problems yet this season due to late season cold and rain but will update my review when I have actually gotten some field use from this product.
2,Seems to have adverse effect on roses,"UPDATE:Several weeks after spraying my rose leaves with this product, I noticed that they are in much worse shape than they'd normally be now, in this first blooming cycle after winter dormancy. I can't say for sure it is this spray, but I can't think of any other factors. The leaves have been eaten by something, in a ""lacy"" pattern. Don't think I'll be using this product on my roses again; maybe on other hardier plants.--------------I've used Safer brand products for at least 20 years. Sometimes I'll just mix up some homemade soap solution, and that will work just fine.But some garden phenomenon require a few relatively benign chemicals. Trouble is, most products have way too many, and this spells trouble for beneficial insects and up the food chain.This product contains everything I'd normally use in the garden but no more, and I don't have to mix myself!"
4,Useful and Easy,"Safer is a brand I trust. I used this spray to battle aphids on pepper plants and a few other pests on other vegetables.It's more expensive than mixing your own solutions, but very convenient.Most of us who garden lack the luxury of time and it's often wiser to have a quick solution than waiting until you have time for a cheaper one. Worked for me."
4,Short but Good,"An interesting tale of Man against the elements in the pre-internet world. A time when attempting to stay alive included walking, boating, and doing what ever it took rather than waiting for the Coast Guard to respond to your EPIRB.A good read."
4,"Don't Cry for Me, Saint Anna","In 1912, the Russian ship Saint Anna, undersupplied and with an incompetent captain, set out to sail the Northeast Passage across the top of Asia. Frozen into the icepack in the notoriously treacherous Kara Sea, the ship drifted north for a year and a half.At this point Valerian Albanov, chief navigation officer and former second-in-command (he had been relieved of duty by his commander; we don't know why), received the captain's permission to leave the ship with thirteen companions. In improvised sledges, skis, and kayaks, they set out for Franz Joseph Land to the south.Only Albanov and one companion survived to be rescued from the same cape on the same island from which Fridtjof Nansen and his companion had been rescued twenty years before. (See Nansen's ""Farthest North"" to see how an Arctic drift SHOULD be handled.) This is the journal that Albanov kept, beginning from the day he left the Saint Anna hopelessly frozen in the ice. Saint Anna was never found."
4,Land of White Death,Excellent book. I have read all of Shackelton's books and actually visited the Shackelton exhibit in Ireland and New York. This previously unknown and unpublished adventure is a must for all people who love artic adventures to read. I enjoyed it immensly.Dr Brad Katzman
4,Polar survival memoir,"This book makes a worthwhile addition to any polar exploration or survival library if only for the fact that it was written by a Russian. Valerian Albanov survived an incredible journey that began as an arctic hunting expedition. The book is relatively short and was written by Albanov himself mostly from his journal entries. If nothing else, after reading this tale you will appreciate dry clothes and a warm bed."
3,disturbing,"I read a lot of true crime and normally things do not stay with me, this one had some very disturbing parts that I wish I would not have read. Not the author's fault, I just would not recommend it."
1,Do Not Buy From This Seller,I bought a macbook from this seller for Christmas and we received the product in time for christmas. At first she liked the computer but after a few month she noticed the computer having problem with freezing when running different programs. We took it into a shop and found out that one of the RAM ports was not functioning and the tech told us that it appeared to not have been working for a while. When I contacted the company they told me that their stuff is only covered for 60 days but they'd love for us to send them the computer so we could pay them even more to fix the problem it came with! What a rip off. The computer isn't a year old and it's already dead and the company's response is pay us more to fix it! Save you money and buy one new or at least from someone else because these guys are complete crooks.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"PURCHASED THIS 5.5 DENSITY FOAM MATTRESS TOPPER FOR PAINFUL BACK, THE TOPPER ARRIVED AND WEIGHED 15 LBS. COULDN'T BE 5.5 DENSITY FOR A KING SIZE MATTRESS TOPPER, THE CHEAPER ONES AT WAL MART WEIGH MORE THEN THIS, AND IT IS 3"" TOO SHORT FOR THE KING SIZE BED, PREVIOUSLY HAD ONE BOUGHT FROM JCPENNEY, THOUGHT I WAS GETTING A MORE QUALITY FOAM MATTRESS TOPPER BY THE AD WRITTEN ON AMAZON BY SELLER, THE COMFORT LEVEL IS NOT ANY BETTER THEN THE CHEAPER ONE PURCHASED FROM JCPENNEY.THE COVER IS A JOKE, NO SUCH THING."
4,It's very cute but doesnt have the fur or beading around the waist,"IT's just like the title says, I bought this jacket and I'm pretty happy with it for the price, however, if you really want it for the fur or the beading around the waist like the picture shows, don't buy it bc it doesnt have it. Normally, I would raise a big stink if someone sold me something that wasnt what it appeared, but now I realize why the jacket didnt cost more than it did. It just isnt that fancy. It doeslook authentic although I cant be sure. It had the Ed Hardy tags on it when I received it, etc. I was a little disappointed that it had no frills though. Fair warning!"
2,"This set WAS the best available, but no more","I have this set, and I was never satisfied with the muffled sound and separated tracks. I knew about the two left-out songs, the shortened solos, the spliced-in applause. I always hoped that somehow the original recording could be issued, complete and unedited. Then, I heard the rumors of such a set in the works. And now it's available, also from Columbia. So, unless you want it as a collector's item, forget this set. I'm sure Columbia will quickly take it out of print, if they haven't already, as their new set is 1000% superior. See my comments under 'Live 1938 at Carnegie Hall-Com '."
5,Much needed update,"Birds of the West Indies is a much needed and well researched update of the classic book ""Birds of the West Indies"" by James Bond. This update provides layman and serious birders and researchers with critically important updates on species distribution and habitat areas. A must read for the serious birders and curious readers interested in understanding the birds of the West Inidan Archipelago."
4,Great reference very Helpful,"Every graphic design student must have this book in their library it is a big help for any step in the design process that you may be in, from correct color to different folds it has it all."
1,More trouble than it's worth,"This mixer is very frustrating to use and took the fun out of baking the first two things I tried. There is no paddle attachment, so the butter gets stuck inside the beaters. The bowl rattles around and almost comes off the stand when mixing anything lumpy. It misses the batter around the edges. At this point it is more satisfying to mix by hand!"
1,Poor Quality Sunbeam Mixmaster - don't buy it,"Don't buy it -- very poor quality. After one use, the blades on the beaters rusted in several places! The speed control only gave you about 6 out of the supposed 12 speeds; the other settings resulted in no speed change. I have had 2 other Sunbeam mixers and was very pleased with them -- never again based on this experience."
4,stand mixer,"I ordered this item as a gift for my daughter. It was shipped in a timely manner, and was received in good condition. I don't know how she likes it yet. She was somewhat disappointed that the base and other parts of the mixer were made of plastic. I don't know how this will affect the durability of the product."
1,Not what I expected - Not good for making flour dough,I am from India and I needed a good mixer/flour dough maker as we make lot of bread as a part of our Indian cuisine.After having read the reviews I bought this product and was disappointed to learn that it didnt work the way I expected it to - Infact it was more time consuming :-(( and left me with more cleaning to do versus my traditional method of hand kneading....So yeah it wasnt good for my sepcefic use. :-((
4,Sunbeam Mixmaster Five Stars,We recived our Sunbream Mixmaster in excelleny condition and it was shipped sooner then expected. The Mixmaster is an excellent product and we are extremely pleased with the product and the way Amazon took care of our order in the most prompt manner without any problems.Steve & Diane
1,UNSCRUPULOUS SELLER,Sunbeam 2379 Mixmaster 300-Watt 12-Speed Stand Mixer with Stainless-Steel Bowl- I received a very used (appeared to be 20 year old) mixer that did not work and was not what i ordered. Was told to send it back and that I would receive full refund of product and shipping charges. Once vendor received item she sent me an email saying it was broken in half. I was then given 1/2 of the cost of product and no refund of shipping costs.
4,Knock Off of the Best Hacksaw,"Lennox dead nailed it with their hacksaw design 20 years ago. This Fuller is a very close copy of that saw, and costs half as much. The only differences are the tensioning wing nut and cheap blade the saw comes with."
3,Competent Thriller,"This is an effort at a high quality thriller set during the Second World War. This is a common setting and Watkins particular slant is to center the plot around French efforts to prevent the Germans from looting French artistic treasures. The hero is a young American painter who becomes involved in forging Old Master artworks that are traded to the Germans for modernist works. The plot and period detail are very good. The book, while written well, lacks something that would transform it from a good thriller to a really good novel. The characters are not cliched but not really interesting either. The evocation of Paris during the Occupation is competent but not gripping. This book is not as good as some of Watkins other work, such as the Story of My Disappearance or In The Blue Light of African Dreams."
2,Not for those with short attention spans,"For those of us with ADHD, this book is easy to set down and just stare at a wall for an hour. This is not by any means a truly enticing book. However if you have alot of time and can trick yourself into thinking a really slow book is ""fascinating"" then go right ahead and read it."
1,No one cares,This is not a movie. It is a number of seemingly random images and dialog pulled together in the order of what is suggested but denied as the story of a very famous artist. Imagery is very striking and poses are pulled from deep shadows reminiscent of works by Caravaggio. That's it.
3,swinger grills,"I have had Meco Swinger II grills for over 30 years. Some of these grills have lasted for 8-10years. I was very dissapointed with the Quality of the new grills. I have never had to assemble the bowl using nuts and bolts, as all previous grills came with a bowl assembled with rivets. Also, the grill seems to be made with lighter,thinner steel than before. If these new grills last as long and give as good of service as all of my older grills, I will be glad to change my comments. I love Swinger grills!"
1,comes in about 150 pieces,"It took a VERY talented man over 6 hours to put this grill together. The parts included were insufficient and when we called the customer svc. number we were told that the parts missing were discontinued. Duh! There are rough edges all over the cover and bottom grill. There were NO DIRECTIONS to install the bottom shelf.Horrible, horrible, horrible! BUY A WEBER - IT COMES IN 2 PIECES!!!"
2,AL MARTINO SPANISH EYES CD,I selected this CD not knowing that the song Spanish Eyes on the CD was not at all like the original version that I had heard him sing. I am disappointed with not getting the original song.
2,Copper Flakes,"The model I received (CQ-1000NH) is copper based, which is fine, but after cleaning and first use the filter housing is littered with flakes of copper. I'm not sure which is worse, flakes of copper in my water or chlorine."
2,Could do better,"Given the good work I have seen Richard Curtis do I expected better from the book. Although there is some good information re performance, I would have liked to have seen more information on how to achieve the moves. There are better books out there to help with this form of doggy dancing"
4,New Tool,It's amazing how this tool replaced a screew driver. What will the EPA think of next. Homelite probably got some kind of reward for this.
4,Mood music,Has such a soft tone in his voice. Very relaxing to listen to and also nice background music if you are doing quiet work. Nice way to end a stressful day.
5,Mathis CD,I really enjoy the music on this CD. It also arrived in good shape and in a timely manner.
4,Fun reading,"I enjoyed this book. The main character tries his best to do what is necessary to keep within his moral beliefs. Adventure and romance, with intrigue mixed in. We need more people like Kevin in this world. Fun read."
2,Where's The Beef?,"I was disappointed with this DVD. The impression one receives from reading the product summary is that you'll come away with a comfortable working knowledge on how to find real estate deals that make money. Particularly as it supposedly comes with a 'workbook', which is nothing more than a booklet with no workbook exercises to complete.Ms. Kiyosaki did speak to some of the properties which she purchased, but did not share the 'why's or how's'. This is the second product I purchased from her and it will be my last. No substance to either....."
3,Marvin Stills deserves 5 stars!!,"It was hard to give three stars on this one because Marvin Gaye is flawless, but I would suggest you buy ""Vunerable"" instead, Marvin Jr. found his soul on the ""Vunerable"" cuts."
2,AVERAGE,AS MUCH AS I Dig Marvin Gaye&He is One Of My All-Time Favorite Artists Ever the Material Here Doesn't Work with His Voice.that has to do with the fact He Hadn't felt the emotion of the material.But He Found His Voice On Vulnerable.that Better Highlights Him than this Set.
3,Pay the extra money and buy the Britax,"I purchased the Britax Marathon for my car, and the Evenflow Triumph for my husbands car. I really didn't want to spend a lot of money for the second car seat since we take my car most of the time. The straps on the Evenflow are very hard to use, and adjust, compared to the Britax. You have to turn a knob on both sides to adjust them, where the britax, you just pull one strap. I had to wash the covers on both, and the Britax came out looking new, the Evenflow was all balled up, and I can't get it to lay flat now. I just broke down and purchased another Britax for our 2nd car. I wish I would have done it to begin with. It is a lot of money, but until they make another brand that is of the same quality, I recommend the Britax."
5,AZ Mom-great purchase,I read all the reviews when I was pregnant and decided on this car seat for when my son got old enough. It was the best purchase I ever made. Both my husband and I have one for each of the vehicles. It has a great safety rating and if you read the directions this car seat is a snap!!
2,Didn't work well for me,"While this seat seems well made and safe there were more negatives than I could handle. First, as mentioned in lots of reviews, the latch mechanism is large and fussy. Standing in the rain fiddling with the mechanism, not fun. Our large 6 mo. old had his entire chest and midsection covered with plastic buckle mechanisms. He still seemed comfortable though. Second, the back seats of our Town & Country minivan have side bolsters that block access to the side mounted buckle release mechanism when rear facing. I'm sure it would work better forward facing, but I want one that works both ways.We were trying to save a little money by not getting another Britax, but we've returned it and will be getting another Britax."
1,Straps to difficult,"I bought this seat because it was rated high and seemed well liked by on-line reviews. After my husband tried for about 5 minutes to get the straps properly adjusted and tight, we both agreed to take it back. I would not want a caregiver to have to try to figure these straps out. Keep it simple for safety."
2,"yes, cleaning","My son just threw up in the this carseat. I removed the cover and washed it as instructed. All the cushioning waded up into balls. Then when I went to put the cover back on..after hosing down the seat itself, the styrofoam pieces broke off. Both sides broke off and the car seat was a mess. This doesn't seem very safe! I took it back to babysrus- which they were amazingly great with their help and return policy (no receipt or box). I had to show them the model on the floor because the car seat was so unrecognizable. When I showed them.. I lifted the cover to show the areas that fell apart and the floor model was also broken in the same place.Don't buy it!"
4,Like the knob feature,"I bought this seat b/c it got good reviews and was recommended to me. It did take some getting use to b/c the straps tighten at the waist instead of at the shoulders like most seats. The double straps were a bit to get used to as well. But now it's so easy to use. I love the knob tightening feature, it makes it so easy. Compared with other seats, this one looked nice and cozy and had plenty of padding. I bought 2 Cosco Eddie Bauers seats and they were such a nightmare. I returned them both for this one and am so happy I did."
5,Great seat for tall children,We purchased this seat almost two years ago when our son was 6 months old and had outgrown his infant car seat. He was so tall that I was concerned that he would outgrow his next seat to quickly. Because the seat is deep it has worked for us for two years. He is now over 36 inches and is ready to move up to a booster soon. We travel in the car a lot and he has always slept great rear facing and forward facing. The straps are easy to adjust from both sides and our straps haven't tangled up. We will use this car seat for our second one. Excellent for the price and very comfortable.
3,Not quite pleased,"We recently bought this car seat for out 10 month old daughter, but will be returning it tomorrow. My sister, who is working on her PhD in Mechanical Engineering raves about it. She spent about 45 minutes explaining to me why it's such a safe & comfortable car seat. But we found that it's 2-3 inches wider than most other car seats & it's heavy. We installed the two carseats together & they took up the entire backseat of a Ford Explorer. My babysitter likes to move the carseat from her car once in a while & it seems to bulky & heavy to move around. My husband didn't like the shoulder straps. When it's adjusted small there are double layer straps that go over the shoulders. He kept threading her arms through the wrong way. My parents absolutely hate the knobs to adjust the harness. They're a little tricky, but not too bad once you get used to them. My little girl seemed comfortable in the car seat. My summary, if you have room, it's a great & safe car seat."
2,No padding and hated the straps!!!!,"This was the first convertible carseat that I have bought being a first time mom. I really liked the fact that the carseat was wide (I have a big boy!). Also, I liked the turn knobs to tighten the straps or so I thought. The turn knobs only tighten the lap part of the belt not the shoulder straps. Once I got the seat home I discovered the double loop shoulder straps were really a pain in the butt. I did not even bother to put it in my car. The other thing I hated was that there was no padding in the seat area. This is not a good thing especially since we will be taking long trips out of state to visit relatives. Cheaper carseats had more padding than this one."
3,not too pleased,"I bought this one because the car seat looked secure/safe and easy to use. The seat is secure/safe, but I am finding it hard to turn the knob to loosen the straps. Also, when I get the straps loosened it doesn't change where the metal hooks are located. They seem to pullwithin his crotch area."
2,Moving on to a better seat...,"My son is now two and I purchased this seat when he outgrew his infant seat at five months.Things I like:- Easy to install- Straps are easy to adjust- Son seems comfortableThings I dislike:- The styrofoam. My son dug at it and was able to chip off little pieces, which poses a choking hazard.- It doesn't travel well. Even though we bought our son a seat on our last flight, the Triumph was too wide to fit in the seat on one of our flights. The airline had to stow it for us at the gate. When it was returned at the gate, one of the styrofoam inserts was missing. Also, it's very, very heavy compared to other carseats. The last time we traveled, we had two different security people comment on what a monster it was as they inspected it.If I had to do it all over again, I'd go with the Britax Roundabout. This Evenflo has too many drawbacks to make it a worthwhile purchase."
5,Ease your mind with this great seat...,"I purchased this seat for my then 6.5 month old son. Although it is slightly heavy, it is a great seat. It installs easily into any size car, either with seatbelts or anchor straps. This has a great padded seat, fabulously easily adjustable straps, and a strong sturdy frame overall. I have no problems strapping ""my little piece of heaven"" in this seat and going for a safe and comfy ride. An added bonus, it is very affordable. I went back a few weeks later and bought a second one for our other car."
5,Great Car Seat,"This car seat is by far the easist to deal with. The straps will never twist on you, and you don't have to yank on your child to get the straps on and off. My daughter feels and looks will a queen in this big chair!"
1,Difficult to Adjust,We got this car seat as a second seat for my husbands car. This is a great seat when not installed - once installed in the car it is horrible. You can not get to the tighten/loosen adjuster knob once the seat is installed.We had the seat installed by the local fireman- and he put the seat in very tight(the correct way) and every time we put our 6 month old in the seat it is a struggle to tighten him in or get him out.I plan on bringing this seat back to Babies R Us for an exchage-
2,My daughter WOULD NOT sit in this seat!,"I know people that are very happy with this seat, but try your own kid in it before purchasing. The seat is very rounded. My daughter hated sitting in and looked so uncomfortable. Her whole body was hunched in it, and her head was pushed forward so she was looking a little down. Since we tried it in BRU first, we knew not to buy it.I have two friends who received it without trying it first. Both registered for it. One's child hated it, the other's loved it. I would rather wait than worry about trying to return it 6+ months after receiving it from a registry.I gave it 2 stars because I do know that it gets good reviews from consumers and the government. Even my local police dept recommends checking it out. But they also warned to try it out first because it is such an odd shape."
5,Excellent Choice!,"I have just recently purchased the TRIUMPH 5 COMFORT TOUCH CAR SEAT WITH LATCH for my vehicle for my 7 month old granddaughter. I did much research on-line, with Britax being out of the question, price wise. There are so many features that thrill me with this seat! The adjustable knobs make tightening or loosening the straps a breeze! It is nicely padded, and VERY stable when using the latch. The reclining feature is phenominal!!! Our granddaughter really seems to enjoy it, so much so that my son and his wife purchased the same one for their vehicle! I STRONGLY suggest also purchasing the foam wedge. The seat, when initally put in was not at the proper 45 degree angle. Her poor little head bobbed to and fro while she slept. The $9.99 wedge took care of that and the seat is just as stable with it as without! EXCELLENT CHOICE!!!!"
2,Returning the Triumph,"After reading so many wonderful reviews and having people come up to us in the store to tell us how wonderful this car seat is, I'm returning it to try the Britax Roundabout. Is it really that difficult to design straps that are easier to use? My husband and I both have problems trying to buckle our 7 month daughter in and lets not even try to loosen the straps. It's impossible when in a rear facing direction. So back to the store I go."
2,"Decent seat, but with some flaws","My son is 3 months old and almost 20 pounds. I have been searching for a new carseat for several weeks now. I bought and returned 4 in all, including the Evenflo Triumph V. Overall, I liked the looks of this seat. It is very well cushioned and has EPS foam. However, it is very heavy and the harness adjustor can be quite frustrating. I took this seat to the local fire department to have assistance with installation. After working with it for an hour we decided that we just didn't like the way it fit in my van. Also, the buckle is very large and the strap is really long. When my son was fastened in securely, the buckle and lower straps came up very far on his abdomen. The carseat technician and I did not think that looked very safe if we were in an accident. I took this seat back and ended up getting the new Britax Marathon (the only one left in the store!). Britax seats are very expensive, but in my opinion are worth the money."
5,Best I've found,"I searched high and low for the perfect carseat, and I found it. I love the recline feature...my son's head doesn't fall at all! This was easy to install; I have it facing backwards. I love all the padding. It took some getting used to, to change the height of the shoulder straps though. I feel my son is safe, so it was worth the extra money. I don't see how any seat could beat this one!"
3,Styrofoam breaks easy,"I bought this carseat 8 months ago not only because it is very safe, but also because it looked better then all the other car seats in the store. I do love my seat, but the styrofoam has already broken on the right side of the seat from me pushing on it to tighten the seatbelt. You have to really make sure the seat is tight and to do that I pushed on the seat while pulling belt tight and the styrofoam cracked. I am not very strong so if I could do it, anyone could. Also when your baby gets a little bigger and you put him in the seat you always have to make sure the buckle part is in fornt of him. I didn't and kept pulling it out from under him and now the fabric is all worn out. No big deal, I still like my seat, it is just too bad since this is my first baby and I will need the seat for many many years..."
5,Great for tall babies,"My 6 month old quickly grew out of his infant carrier, so I decided to do some research on a car seat. He is in the 95th percentile for height so getting something that would be suitable for his height was very important. I found that not only was the triumph the safest car seat in crash test studies, but it also is very good for tall babies. I bought it and adjusted it to him, it is wonderful. It is so comfortable to him. It fits GREAT in my Camry. I am very pleased with this buy. I may find some downfalls to this purchase later, but for now I think this is the best decision I coulda made."
4,Worth the money,This is a pretty plus car seat & my daughter seemed to really enjoy the extra space (coming from the Graco infant seat). It secures in the car fairly easily & most of the adjustments can be made without taking it out of the car. Currently we are using the seat rear-facing since my daughter is only 9 months old & she's been using the seat for about 2 months now. We used another inexpensive Evenflo model while we were out of town once & that seat pales in comparison the Triumph. I'm hoping we'll have the seat for a couple more years without any problems. The only problem I've had is adjusting the straps/harness once she's snapped in. The straps can become a bit tangled and uneven & it's like solving a riddle to get it straightened so that my child is securely in place.
2,"They say ""you get what you pay for"" but it's not always true","I had purchased this car seat after extensive review.So, I was confident with my purchase, but quicklydisillusioned. The straps are like an intricate spider web.Which is particularly frustrating, because one has tofigure out which one goes where.Our second complaint about this car seat is thatthe straps twist much too easily.A couple of months after we purchased this car seat,we decided that we needed to purchase a car seat forour second car. We then purchased the Graco ComfortTouch for that vehicle-and we love it!!In fact, we now avoid the other car (with the Evenflo)as much as possible!We find the Graco model mucheasier to strap the child in and as an added touchthere's even a cup holder!Here's the real kicker...I paid almost half the price!"
4,Great car seat for the price,"I've been using this car seat for 1 month after my now 7.5 mo. old daughter outgrew her infant seat. I was impressed that the ratings in Consumer Reports were comparable to the expensive Britax seats. The seat seems to be well padded and comfortable for my ~19 lb. 26"" daughter to sit in (rear facing). It was very easy to install and to adjust the strap tension. I also like how easy it is to move the shoulder straps to each of the three settings- you don't even have to take the seat out of the car!The only reason I give this seat 4 stars (not 5) is because of the difficulty we had removing the seat cover for washing. My daughter leaked through her diaper on to the seat cover at the end of a very long trip. I had to uninstall the car seat and bring it in the house in the pouring rain, only to find out that I needed a screwdriver in order to take off the cover!!! Seems odd, considering how easily everything else is about this seat.Overall, a great seat."
4,"No Spanish rhyme, but still worthwhile","Even though the Spanish portions don't rhyme, I still found the book a worthwhile tool for working with those gaining proficiency in reading the Spanish language. Because it doesn't go to lengths to make it rhyme, the English concepts are easier for beginners to find in the Spanish wording, and the words are easier to grasp the meaning of without a dictionary."
1,Teacher Review: Not true to Dr. Seuss's literary style,"Dr. Seuss's books are known for their rhyme and and whimsical characters. This translation DOES NOT succeed in achieving the lyrical style in Spanish. Any Dr. Seuss books translated by Aida Marcuse or Yanitzia Cannetti are fabulous because they ARE able to maintain the lyrical rhyme in Spanish. I hope one day that one of those two translators does their magic with The Cat in the Hat. In the mean time, I just read this one to my son in English. The sequel, El Gato con Sombrero Viene de Nuevo, (I believe is the title), is translated by one of these ladies and is fabulous."
2,Uninspired translation,"This is a literal translation of The Cat in the Hat, and it loses all of what makes Dr. Seuss special. The cadence, rhythm and rhyme are all missing in this very uninspired translation. If you want to read Dr. Seuss in Spanish, try Juevos Verdes con Hamon. That translation was done right!"
3,FOR THOSE WITH SOME WORK EXPERIENCE IN ASSET MANAGEMENT,The book is a compilation of submissions by well trained and qualified practitioners but it does presume a good degree of understanding of portfolio theory as in many cases it is a matter of tweaking around the edges for enhanced performance.
1,A good science presented wrong,"Spectrochrome did help my son in 2009 to start talking, however this book is full of insults to Drs and counter insults. And mainly a historical presentation and lawsuits and magazine pieces.... Let there be light was right to the point not this. The burn case was interesting to see and poor Dr Baldwin and what they did to her instead of a thank you."
3,"The Cooler is good, but doesn't reach far enough...","A man, down on all his luck, Macy does a superb job along with notable performances by Bella and Alec Baldwin(who steals the movie in some sense). But is he really a man that never catches a break? As you'll see, things change, but his lows weren't low enough in my opinion to really mark the reversal of his luck, however long it will last. Had he gone through something more dramatic, the impact may have been greater, but then again, this film may only have been trying to tell the story of a basically lonely guy with not much luck, and a sense of magic ""bad luck"" when it comes to casinos.A string of good performances, and worth taking a look at if you like a good story of a man down on his luck."
5,Stars shine in gritty Vegas movie,"'The Cooler' is the best Vegas movie since 'Casino' and is in many ways a better film. An engrossing story, top-notch performances by William H. Macy and Maria Bello in a story about a professional loser in an old-style casino far from the Bellagio. But the revelation (again) is Alex Baldwin, playing a connected casino boss with a combination of charm and thuggery that just must be seen - and earned him an Oscar nomination. He should have won. Don't miss this entirely original thrilling movie."
2,Had Potential..... But Overall Dissappointing.,"I bought this DVD based on reccomendations from friends and some of the strong reviews I read here at Amazon. I thought the premise of the movie was quite clever, and I thought it was well cast. However, I feel the movie was hurt by poor developement of the characters and the story. It seemed like the movie had a hard time getting going. I found myself waiting for something to happen and before I knew it the film was over. There were a number of questionable plot points that I won't get into here. If you're one of those people that always pick up on things in movies, like ""how did that guy get there?"", then you will find that there a number of those type of moments in The Cooler.Overall, the movie was based on an interesting idea but that's where it ends. I would reccomend reading the back cover and leaving it at that. If you must see it, rent, don't buy."
3,just okay,"This was a decent movie. It was about a man, played by William H. Macy, who works as a cooler at a casino. He breaks the flow of the high rollers when they are winning too much, simply by being near them. He brings bad luck. He meets a woman and falls in love, and his luck starts to change. It was a good movie to watch, but it is very slow in parts."
4,"A good Las Vegas fable: what happens in Vegas, stay's ......","It's a movie. That means by definition it is not reality. I can't believe the negative reviews that I am reading here. Like all movies, this is a not reality which is why it has a sap finding a hooker with a heart of gold and ending up the way he does.There are obviously better ways to spend 100 minutes of your life but if you intend to inertly stare at moving pictures, this is pretty good.It's an interesting 'story' with twists and good actors. On top of that the film has great soundtrack and good cinematography.Does it make you want to go to Vegas? Well, no but then again your mileage may vary compared to mine :-)"
4,Wonderful soundtrack,"The music throughout the entire film was great. The slow & varied jazz tracks gave the Vegas setting in the background a nice warm feel, especially Krall's I'll String Along with You. I'll be looking out the the soundtrack for sure..."
2,disapointing movie,"OK, I get it. When William H. Macy's character falls in love, he is no longer cursed with bad luck and he loses his ability to ""cool"" down hot gamblers. He can even get cream in his coffee.This move is way too obivous and mechanical, and because of it, it's hard to see the characters as real people. I actually had some sympathy for old-school Alec Baldwin until he turned violent. It might have been interesting if he were portrayed sympathetically, trying to stay alive in a bland, profit-oriented world. Alas, no use for nuance in ths flick.And the ending - where he reaches in the car and grabs the beer can - was the most remarkably stupid thing I have seen since Joaquin Phoenix swung his baseball bat in Signs."
1,Only lasted 6 months,Can't believe this didn't last even a year! The last KRUPS I had lasted 5 years and this couldn't even last a year. The water stopped registering and won't drip even when filled. What a waste of money!
3,Good coffee but......,"This nice appearing unit makes good coffee but it is almost impossible to pour without getting drippage from condensate or some coffee spilled on the counter from the carafe cover. Also, unless you place the carafe in the unit in an exact and special manner (not explained in directions) coffee runs all over counter."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this 3 years ago and last week it ""gave out"". Something went wrong and it no longer could recognize when there was water in the water reservoir. The same day, just before it stopped reading water levels- I had brewed a pot. When I lifted the carafe to pour a cup, the paint on the heat plate peeled off with the carafe and revealed a disgustingly rusted area. I'm very disappointed. I had a Mr. Coffee before this, and it worked for 10 years! And, it cost a lot less! I switched because I wanted a larger coffee maker, and in my research I found that Krups was supposed to be one of the best brands you could buy. It actually still works... I gave it to a friend once I bought my Krups. I loved this coffee maker though! It brewed such a nice cup. Unfortunately, I don't think I will buy another Krups again."
2,If only it had lasted ...,"I bought this unit less than a year ago. An important feature for me is an auto shutoff that allows more than two hours. This model was adjustable up to 5 hours, so that was a personal plus. When I first got it, there was a strong plastictaste in the coffee. I ran clear water through it five or six times, but the bad taste remained. Thankfully, it went away after a few weeks of use. Beyond that point, the coffee maker worked fine and the coffee tasted good. Today it suddenly stopped working. I went to get a cup of coffee and it was cold. The unit said it was on, but the burner was cold. I emptied it and tried to run wather through it - lights go on, but it doesn't do anything. The good news - it's still under warranty. The bad news - I have to send it to a service center for repair or replacement. The closest service center to me is about 300 miles away. So obviously, the easy answer is ... I'll have to buy a new coffee maker. But it won't be a Krups!"
1,please don't support this model by buying it,"well, less than 6 months later it is finally falling apart as other reviewers have stated. ok, i'll make this one in list form:*the heating plate starting losing paint almost immediately and now looks like burnt coffee even after i scrub it.* the door falls off a <em>lot</em>. seriously.*the door doesn't close correctly because of the last problem*it never made coffee hot enough. it cools half way through a mug of coffee"
2,Hot Plate and Air Bubble issues,We have had the coffee maker about 2 months. It makes good coffee but if you pour water too quickly into the left side of the reservoir you get air bubbles in the water level indicator. Told to pour on the right side...The heating plate covering has come off on about 1/2 of the surface. What gives with that???Time to take it back and get another machine.
2,Good Coffee From A Poorly Made Machine,"The FME4-14 brews a nice cup of coffee, as should be the case from any coffee machine backed by Krups' reputation. That's about all the compliment this machine can be given.Problems:The ""attached"" lid makes cleaning the carafe an awkward affair. It is ostensibly detachable, but the hinge feels far too flimsy to survive multiple removals.The ""auto stop"" plunger on the filter holder barely works. I've spilled many cups of coffee when removing the carafe before brewing is complete.By default, the device beeps whenever brewing is complete. Make it stop.The whole apparatus for inserting/removing the charcoal filter is flimsy. I broke it during initial setup of the machine -- and I was being as gentle as humanly possible.Save your money. Krups has made exceptional machines in the past, and I trust they will again one day. In the meantime, look to the competition if you need a new coffee maker anytime soon."
4,good value and dependability for the price,this item holds up well. is tough and constructed well. it's lightweight and folds compactly for storage.
5,"Seductive, exotic, intriguing...","I had almost given up on short stories as a genre, but Adam Lewis Schroeder gives new hope in this collection of stories that are wildly different in location, theme and approach to most other collections I've read, and yet jive with my own experiences as a traveller and as a human being. He avoids the trappings of post-colonial guilt and instead focusses on relationships, memories, experiences and events in ways that made me feel I was there. The novella at the end is wonderful. More, please!"
1,"Long on generalities, short on detail.","Surprisingly, this book already feels dated as it seems to have emerged from the e-boom. It aims very much at the broad picture as it appeared at that time. It has relatively little to say about the nitty-gritty of what aspects of Web engineering need special consideration in the context of CM.Disappointing from someone who has written well about CM in the past."
5,Excellent Book on Deforestation in the Amazon,"This is an excellent book on the deforestation occuring in the Brazilian Amazon region. It makes an excellent argument that deforestation is connected to both economic and political interests, at a regional, national and global level."
3,Important sizing information,"They need to note on this listing that in Capezio world woman's size 3 is a child's size 1. So if you buy your kid with size 3 feet a size 3, you are going to get a shoe that is way too small! It's very irritating, cause at this age/size, you can't buy from the listing that have child sizes anymore. Otherwise the shoes look very nice. You do have to start sewing on the elastic now - not like the Daisy's that come with it presewed. Just do the math and make sure you get the right size."
2,Same old physics.,"More arcade than simulation. AI oppenents make the races more of a demolition derby than a race. Graphics are great, but they are spoiled by a disappointing gaming experience."
3,Major Glitches In this Game,"This game has at least 2 glitches I've heard. The glitch I've run into is where you can't get out of a building called Dark Forge. I've read that I have to restart. I did waste about 2 hours though trying to figure out what happened. Only to confirm the glitch or ""bug"" on the internet. I hope I'm entitled to a free upgrade to the bug free copy when or If it ships. Otherwise, this game would get 5 stars from what I've seen so far."
5,The Demo is excellent,"In the latest edition of JAMPACT (Playstation Underground) there is a Demo for this game. I was very impressed with the first for PS1, and the sequel is looking to be 300 times better graphics wise and sound wise. I would recommend this game to anyone who is an RPG/Action fan."
5,Best in Series!!,I really love this game.It continues right from where 1 left off which most games don't do.After you travel through the time portal you meet Moebius.The story kicks off from there.PROS:-The phenomenal voice-actors appear again.-The gripping story continues-Fighting is better than in 1-GraphicsCONS:-Save points are far apart from eachother-Too short-Ends in another to be continuedAll in all this is a fantastic game
3,Kitchen Witchery,This was bought on the recommendation of my niece. Not exactly what I thought it was. Was expecting a self help/recipe book and this was not it.
4,Great for Genesis Fans,"Loved The Movie Box Set, even though disapointed with one dvd left out and thought older dvd's would be abit more comprehensive. Great all together.deepseakelly of CA."
3,Why no Blu-Ray?,"I find it strange that they are not issuing a Blu-Ray set, with DVD slowly but surely fading away. I suppose they intend to milk customers a second time around. I will pass up and wait for the inevitable Blu-ray that will eventually be released. The 3 stars are the format, not the content."
4,"NG Birds, 4th edition","Several new birds appear in this edition; strays and vagrants I may never come across, but appreciate none the less. The volume was a little premature, as it still lists the Ivory Billed Woodpecker as probably extinct, so the 5th edition will probably soon follow. I would recommend waiting for the next edition."
1,The digital age,"I appreciate the warning about the photographs in this book. Why else would someone buy a book such as this other than to look at the beautiful homes in all of their splendor? I blame the digital age and bad scanning/reproducing/printing and I agree, some things are better off left alone and out of print."
5,Great buy timely delivery,I got this very quickly.I will really enjoy this CD. I used to listen to this group years ago.I would recommend this to anyone who likes that old rockabilly type style. Ricky S
3,An Excellent Bar Band - A Mediocre Recording,"With the release of the single `Tuff Enuff' in 1986, the Fabulous Thunderbirds earned the public's attention. The song is a high energy bass-thumping R&B number with an unforgettable shimmering rhythm guitar - great Texas roadhouse blues. The album `Tuff Enuff' is a collection of blues, rock & roll, and R&B - excellent bar music. Unfortunately, in this case, the fervor of a live act (especially after two of three beers) doesn't translate well during the recording session. The Fabulous Thunderbirds are a legitimate blues band, but nothing here matches the vigor of the title song. Producer Dave Edmunds attempts to cover the band's shortcomings with ""speed playing."" `Amnesia,' `True Love,' `I Don't Care' and `Down At Antones' are played at what seems like 100 MPH. What's the purpose in playing 8 and 12-bar blues at breakneck speed? Fast may get the crowd on the dance floor in front of the band ""live,"" but the muscle and exhilaration just isn't here."
5,Fab T-Birds are Tuff Enuff,I originally bought the cd when it came out back in the eighties but lost it when my mustang got stolen. I have been looking for the cd ever since. If you like blues rock & roll you will love the thunderbirds tuff enuff. Excellent buy any time. Long live blues and rock & roll.
4,Nice Gift,The price of this cd means that it would make the perfect gift for a friend who loves the Backstreet Boys. Featuring live tracks lile I Want It That Way. Dont Want You Back and other tracks like Dont Want To Lose You Now and Its True this cd is a must have for any fan of the Backstreet Boys
3,Jeez,"Well I love BSB, but I gotta say this cd kinda bites. I got it at burger king, for goodness sake. The songs are good, but lets face it, they're not the absolute best at performing live. Of course I bought it to show my bsb pride, but other then that its kinda pointless. Sorry!"
2,sans sucre chocolate sugar-free mousse,"This was not what I expected. It did not whip up to a mousse but was like a chocolate pudding. I tried it twice to see if I made a mistake,but it came out the same each time. The taste was also not what I expected. I had other sugar-free mousse's in the past and they were good. I called to send the rest of the carton back, but the girl said she can't take it back, so I will donate the boxes to a charity."
2,Very Bad Shipping,"Product was shipped lose in a large box, 3 times to large, resulting in the container breaking. Most of the product was crushed, melted, and unusable. I will not be shopping with this supplier again."
2,Eh.,"Not a great product from IBM. The feel and look is mediocre and the function isn't great either. I switched to logitech, and like them pretty well."
1,Bag product.,One bag is leaking the other is about ready to go. I called the customer service and they said I have to buy new bags?!!?? What happenned to the so called warranty on this product. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!
2,"Errors here, errors there, error EVERYWHERE!","After reading positive reviews of this book from Amazon.com, I bought it with high hopes... This book could be worth reading if there would not be so many errors everywhere! I can't believe how many typos & missing steps & steps told in wrong order there is in this book! Buy some other more professional book."
1,*yawn*,"I wonder if the Iraqi people are sorry they aren't threatened with being forced into a woodchipper feet first, so they can see what what was happening to them.Where were the liberals when all of that was going on?"
3,first time framers and apprentices line up,"I would recommend this book to beginning framers, apprentices, and homeowners who want to learn to do there own work. Professional carpenters and journeyman should pass it by. The book itself is very well layed out and complete. It is rather low tech and somewhat dated in the new world of 'hurricane and earthquake' code requirements. But, I like it. it does not promise more than it delivers and what it delivers in content is well presented."
2,Boring.,"I love books about nutrition, but this one could not hold my interest. There is alot of good information in this book, I just did not find it to be an easy read."
3,I really wanted to like it....,"The book has excellent reviews and I am a fan of the author. How could I go wrong? Unfortunately, it is boring and repetitive. The content could be summed up in a pamphlet and the material just puts me to sleep. I am trying so hard to finish it, but just cannot. I have read over 20 nutrition books this year, and this one takes the cake for losing my interest. Skinny Bitch promotes the same general principles, and is hilarious and main stream."
1,bitter,The guy used to sell his magazine at the games (blue line) but was prevented from doing so when he started ripping the team in it. So he wrote a 176 page book from the perspective of a bad attitude.Not worth the money at any price.
4,Vicks Steam Inhaler,"This would have 5 stars except for getting very hot. Reservoir that holds about a cup of water heats up to a boil and thus the steam. By the time it gets to full boil it is very hot and you need to move your face away from the heat. Just like putting your face near a pot of boiling water. You still get the steam, your just farther away. You can put a towel over your head and let the steam fill the towel as you breathe in. Had a cold and it helped clear my head."
2,A pot of boiling water and a towel: cheaper and more effective,"I get frequent sinus infections and steam treatments are the only thing that truly keep them at bay. I was hoping for a cleaner/tidier alternative to the pot and towel over the head method, but the steam this machine produces is not nearly hot enough to be effective. Furthermore the face shield didn't really fit my face at all. If you're just looking for a nice steam facial I'm certain this would be fine, but for a true sinus cleanse this just won't work for me. Will be returning."
1,Don't buy this for kids to use,"This thing is pretty poor. The heating mechanism basically boils the water you put in the recipient. There are two gaping holes whose size you can adjust, but even at the smallest setting the mask is close enough that very hot water will splash on your face. I returned this immediately."
1,Didn't turn on at all,"Right out of the box it didn't work. I should have known better than to buy Vicks because I'd purchased a similar humidifier in the store years ago and it broke down (electrical failure) after just a few uses. However Amazon was AMAZING on the return of this product. Super easy to print the return label and got my refund within a week. I used the refund money to purchase the ""Revlon Spa"" steam spa which is working like a champ! Don't buy the Vicks... save your time and get Revlon!"
3,"its ok, nothing that great","Just bought this for the cold i get every year in the winter. after trying many from retail stores, wanted to give this a try.. i was bit disappointed that only like 2oz of water can be filled. also note that you can not add any liquid vicks to hot water. you have to use some sort of pads. i am sure it is expensive."
2,So-so steam production,"Doesn't do much of what you want it for. Puts out a lot of very hot air (even capable of burning the face.) However, I would like more actual steam to come out."
3,Not quite what I expected,"Unit is smaller than I thought it would be. Alittle expensive for what it is. The hood could be alittle larger. Had I seen this item in person, I think I would have passed. Not exactly what I wanted."
2,Not enough steam. Just hot air.,My title says it all. It is a very convenient concept and a good way to conserve water/electricity but the steam is what clears my air passages.
2,Dangerously uncomforatable to use,Purchased this at the suggestion of my doctor. Both my son and I burned ourselves using it. You are better off with a pot of steaming water and a towel.
1,Light will not go on after first use. )-:,Bought this item from Amazon.com last winter. We used it for the first time in March 2010. Cleaned it and put it back in the box. I took it out of the box today as I have Bronchitis and Sinus probelms. The dang light will not go on. The directions does not address this problem. Hubby said toss it out and buy something decent. You would think that the Vicks name was a decent product. Not happy here.
5,Obsessed,I'm an actor and a singer and this steamer saved my life this summer. I'm doing 8 shows a week of summer stock theatre this summer in California where the air is VERY dry. Steaming twice a day with this little inhaler moistened my voice and allowed me to rock out every show. I recommend this to anyone who uses their voice for an extended period of time. It's a wonderful product and SUPER easy to maintain.
3,better choices for me ...,"i bought this because i have chronic dry nose / sinuses.first, you can easily burn yourself with this thing. when it is warmed up, putting your face all the way onto it *will* burn you. scalding your nostrils is no joke. it needs to have a longer stem portion or something. i'm surprised they aren't getting sued.other than that, it works, but there are better options, for me at least. a small ultrasonic humidifier is about the same price and produces more, denser vapor that is easier to inhale as it is cool. it also holds more water and can be used generally as a humidifier for a room, where this one cannot as it holds only enough water for 10 minutes or so and it must be watched closely to ensure it hasn't run dry. it won't automatically shut off it just sits there cooking itself."
4,Bobby Booth speaks again,"This book recounts the ins and outs of what has happened in Latin American and Miami aviation over the past few decades, and it's written in a readable style. Bobby describes a world full of weird characters, all of whom he knew, and marginal airlines, many of which he advised. In many Latin American countries, airlines are a primary representative of the country, which brings Bobby into the world of politics - which he loved. As a reporter who once covered Miami aviation, I really enjoyed this book."
5,"Excellent ""I was there"" dialogue on the business of aviation","I have been in the aviation business for forty four years. Seldom do you find a book that provides a credible, ""I was there"", ""behind closed doors"", look at the pesonalities and the not always legal or fair web of events that fostered the aviation industry. Bob Booth's casual presentation style makes you feel like you are part of his story , living and experiencing the trivial to the consequential, living and experiencing a life deeply envolved in shaping the aviation industry to be."
1,Language barrior,"I'm sure this is a great band IN THEIR NATIVE LANGUAGE. But it's hard to have an emotional impact when you're singing lyrics phonetically. Unintended humor such as, ""Hey fellas have you heard the juice!"" hurt this CD tremendously."
5,"I Took 6,000 pictures with this camera!","I've had this DX3500 for a little over a year and have worked with it several times a week, under many different conditions. I absolutely love it and have had no trouble whatsoever. I print up to 8x10 on a Lexmark printer and it is still going strong after 6,000 shots. I did not purchase dock, and use Kodak rechargeable battery pack that came with accessory kit. The Energizer blue and silver AA batteries also give dependable use. I also used Kodak's customer service for advice and they were very helpful."
4,First-time Digital Camera User,My husband received this camera free at a conference. It sat in a cabinet for about six months. Finally I opened the box and figured out how to use it. It produces great photos to e-mail. I have printed 5 by 7's that are quite clear.
1,Kodak 3500,This camera has been a source of much frustration for me.I have continuous problems downloading. The camera works about one forth of the time. It will be the last Kodad camera I buy.Caroline Murray Marks
4,Great Camera/Poor software,"This camera is the greatest!! Very fast transfer of photos from camera to computer. Longer battery life than other digital cameras. Very simple to operate. Very good quality of photos. User friendly. The software to download from camera to computer is fast and simple. The Kodak Photo software that comes with it is terrible. No option to delete photos you don't want without going to hard drive, finding file and deleting. Don't understand why there is not a delete option in the software. I use a different program for editing photos. Also, no option to easily reduce pixels or size in their software."
3,It's Aiight...,Im a real Hip Hop head. But I love all Hip Hop. From Mannie Fresh to Masta Ace. From Talib Kweli to T.I. Jay-Z to Nas....This record is pretty tight for the ride but nothing worth listening to for thought provoktion. Mannie Fresh cant rap if his life depended on it. But his beats are mostly decent to very good.1
5,"it's an album, read haha","The Cash Money beats are going a little bit old school wit what they use to do, with the new. Overrall result, best beats i've heard. Mannie's flow has gotten better over the years, a while back lots of people from the N.O. area thought neither he or Baby could rap. Thing's change and i'd say this is the best album from the south in a good while beside Lil Wayne's, Tha Carter. Just get the cd, go buy it. Maybe only two songs I didn't like and that differs between people. All the skits are funny and he even got Lil Wayne to spit twice on two tracks for some diversity."
1,"BAH, HUMBUG","I KNOW CRAP WHEN I SEE IT OR IN THIS CASE READ IT! THE BOOK I READ HAD JAMES BOOK PROPOSAL INCLUDED, TOO BAD HE DIDN'T LEAVE IT LIKE THAT-IT WOULD HAVE SAVED PAGES OF DRIVEL. THE BOOK MAY HAVE HAD SOME MERIT WHEN IT WAS READ ALOUD FROM THE ORIGINAL SERIALS, BUT THEY ARE LOST IN THE LAST 100 YEARS.OH, DID YOU KNOW THAT IT APPEARED IN AMERICAN MAGAZINE IN TWELVE PARTS.I READ PORTRAIT FORTY YEARS AGO FOR AN SLU ENGLISH CLASS AND PICKED THE HARDEST BOOK ON THE LIST. I PANNED IT AND GOT IT SOCKED TO ME AS IT WAS THE PROF'S FAVORITE BOOK. HE WASN'T MUCH OF A TEACHER EITHER. I JUST READ WASHINGTON SQUARE, WHICH ISN'T BAD FOR A SHORT ROMANCE NOVEL. I SUSPECT JAMES WAS PAID BY THE WORD AND HE DID NOT HESITATE TO PILE IT UP.DAVID N BLODGETT daveb@gloryroad.net"
3,Digimon World 2: Not worth your time,"This game, although fun at first, gets very repetitive after a while. The cutscene at the beginning of the game is awesome, but It has almost nothing to do with the game. (Can't digivolve during battle.) This game would have rocked if you could digivolve during battle, like in the TV show."
4,"Good, not great","Digimon world 2 is a fun game. However, it isn't flawless. If you lose only once, it is game over. Also, EP prevents you from getting far. And level limit makes you lose 2 digimon just to go above level 13. It is a good idea, but I think someone should check it over, or redo it all, because otherwise it will take forever just to get to mega."
3,Lacking in the excitment department,"I have found the DW2 to be on the boring side. There isn't much interaction with the digimon partners as I would like. The battles are not what I thought they would be; I find them to be extremely boring. I think this game is okay for the younger digimon fans but it is definately not for me. The graphics are impressive but the game as a whole ""is not"" but this is only my opinion. If there will ever be a DW3, if hope it will be more like DW1. I suggest renting the game before purchasing just to see for yourself if you really like it. Thank you for reading this and good luck with your digimon adventures."
3,okay why does this sound like rick james-prince wannabe season,you like teena marie dig this but if you'ere a p funk nut like me and wanna know everytghing about the mob you have to check out bootsy collins doing backup duties on the title track the track sounds like a bootsy hand me down seriously.
2,What Happend,"Ever since Lady T left Motown in 1982, her populartiy began to show some strain witht he release of Robbery in 1983. Next you have Starchild, a Freestyle crossover from then till 1987's Naked To the World. However, there were some mixed reviews of Emerald City but most of it were negative. Standout tracks of this album were the title track, Once Is Not Enough which segues into Lips To Find You, You So Heavy and her freestyle ballad Shragi La. This album proves to be puzzling and Dissapointing."
2,cheap belt clip,"I specifically ordered this case because of the belt clip shown in the photo. From experience it's a tight holding clip. However, what came with the case was a cheap plastic clip that I had to install on the back of the case & that barely held on to a thin belt. The case would have been great had it had the clip shown. I returned this item."
1,Terrible!,The quality is terrible; it does not even fit the pouch that comes with the trimmer.Customer service is excellent: I returned the trimmer and got my money back.Purchased Panasonic and very happy with it.
3,Upgrade one level,"The MB-40 is a good product but it takes too long to charge and the charge does not last long enough. I dont like to travel with a heavy charger and prefer to charge at home no more than weekly. I understand the next level up has a better battery in this regard. Also, I liked the old model built-in small shaver for detailed trimming. It slid up and had a firm support to and fro the face. The present one pops up and is firm only to the face. You have to really shove it in to cut close. Still there does not seem to be anything better now on the market."
3,decent sound - no voice,These earbuds work fine for listening to music. The sound is a little crisp and not a whole lot of bass but overall not bad. The microphone doe snot work at all on the pair I got but I mainly used them foe listening to music anyways.
2,Chews through filters quickly,"I quickly discovered that this thing chews through its filters. We keep this running 24 hours a day in my son's nursery, so that it's ready to go when he goes down for naps and for bedtime. It has a large tank, so I only refill it once a day, but keeping it running that long means the filters only last about 2-3 weeks. We used the Kaz WF2 Extended Life Replacement Humidifier Filter, which are a little on the expensive side, so we decided to find a different humidifer that didn't have such high maintenance costs.Other than the speed at which it went through filters, it was a good humidifier. Maybe if you only run it at night the filters would last longer."
4,cool mist,"It's a decent humidifier - a little loud at low speed, and quite loud at high speed. The filters are about about $7 each, so be prepared to spend some $$ to keep it running"
4,vicks humidifier,I bought this one for my daughter. She is all praise for it. Says it is working well and has helped a lot by mitigating the dryness in the air.
3,"Humidifier works great, if you can unscrew the cap to fill it.","I purchased 2 of these humidifiers, one for my bedroom and one for my son's room. The humidifier works great and will usually run 2 to 3 nights on the low setting without having to be refilled. However, it takes the muscle power of both my son and I to get the cap open to refill the tanks on both units. I have had several other people try it as well, and they push on the cap to the point that they are shaking, and it still won't turn. I have even put vaseline on the seal, and it still hasn't helped. I guess the good thing is, you sure don't have to worry about it leaking. Am I the only one that has had trouble with this?"
2,"Works, but our floor is ruined",This works well if you keep it in one place and don't move it. Our hardwood floors were recently refinished and we now have buckling due to this leaking and we weren't aware so it sat there a while. I am about to look for a new one and donate this one. But I wanted to make certain I forewarned others before purchasing.
3,"Simple design, but leaks and not that strong","I purchased this humidifier a while back for our new baby, and it has been helpful in keeping the air from becoming too dry. I also like the simple design, that makes it easy to refill and replace filters, but there are some drawbacks. If you tilt the humidifier the wrong way, it does leak out the bottom as others have pointed out. You have to keep the humidifier on a level surface, and move the water tank around only. Also, the tank is a little awkward to put in, so that can be a small nuisance. The other point that concerns me is that this model is not very strong. On the low setting, the humidifier is very quiet (which is good), but doesn't output very much. The high setting is loud and a bit too strong, cold.Vicks has a good start here, and for a basic humidifier for a small room, this will work fine, but the design flaws need to be addressed, and a ""medium"" setting put in as someone suggested in an earlier review."
2,Noisy and Defective Fan,"At first I thought I kind of liked it, but now I don't after 2 days. I thought the High setting was rather loud like listening to an air conditioner in the summer and that the Low setting was a bit quiter, but then I realized after 1 night that the fan was defective. Periodically the fan would scrape the plastic casing on the inside and I would hear this loud noise even on the low setting which was supposed to be quieter. Now I have to return it which is the biggest pain of it all."
4,"Nice, Small, User friendly","I've only had this about 2 weeks now and it seems to be just great. It's small, not sure how much water the tank holds. My sons room is pretty small and the humidifier works fine in it. The high setting is pretty noisy so it usually stays on Low. It's easy to fill and keep clean. If your looking to use this for a big room/area look at something larger. I don't think it would keep up. I'm happy with it!"
3,"Good, not great","We have had this humidifier for almost a year now. The mist is not as powerful as I first thought it would be. For some reason our humidifier sometimes does not ""utilize"" the water in the tank. We fill up only 1/5 of the capacity and it's on for about 8 hours during the night, and sometimes there is still water left in the tank. It's a pain since you should not let water sit there, otherwise it gets stinky and dirty.This is the other downside. The filter does get very dirty pretty easily, and stinky. We use only at night, every day, and the filter gets ""nasty"" with 1 month of use. We do use tap water.We can notice difference in the room when it's on. We turn it on for about 30 min before going to bed, leave the bedroom door closed and you can definitely tell the room is not as dry."
1,no replacement parts availaBLE,I RECEIVED ONE OF THESE FOR CHRISTMAS. I CANNOT RETURN IT BECAUSE I HAVE NO RECEIPT. IT WAS MISSING THE TRAY AND FILTER. THE COMPANY SAYS THERE ARE NO REPLACEMENT PARTS AVAILABLE. WHAT COMPANY MAKES SOMETHING WITH REMOVABLE PARTS AND DOESNT HAVE REPLACEMENT PARTS?
4,"Good, reliable product.","Easy to refill. Produces a moderate amount of moisture (not nearly as much as the ultrasonic ones can, but that's better if you are worried about mold). The higher setting is a bit loud and the filters are expensive, but it does it's job and seems very sturdy and well-made."
2,Hmm.. who said that this one is quiet ?,"hm.. this was turned on while I was talking to my mom.All of sudden, she asked to me ""Is your place under construction?, what's the noise? """
4,does what I needed,"I ordered this for my room in Afganistan. I am currently deployed there and this helps me sleep well. Due to the dry, arid climate here when I wake up in the morning I do much better."
3,Meh. I guess.,"This is the first humidifier I've bought. I got it at RiteAid and bought it because it was cheap(er). I got it because my poor cat gets so static-y in the winter time and every time she goes to sniff something, ZAP! Her poor little nose. And I can't really pet her because of it.It does help a little. I've noticed a significant drop in the static but it doesn't fix it all. Well, that's what I get for living in the north east.It doesn't have a heater so the air is cold, not something that I would prefer in the winter time. The plug you have to turn to fill it is HARD to open if it's wet (and it's always wet) and I'm not a little weakling.But otherwise, it sort of does what it's supposed to. My cat likes it more than I do. She loves to sit in front of it for hours and watch the bubbles."
1,Water in Bowl Works Better,This is the worst humidifier I've ever owned. We own many.This thing just sits there. You can have it on for a week and most ofthe water is left. Perfect waste.
1,what mist? invisible,"It states cool mist, there is no mist to speak or feel of, coming out of this unit. It's just like a tiny exspensive fan, that will evaporate the water from the tank. Yes, it does the job of humidifying but, there is no mist at all. I wish I could keep this product but, I wil buy another of my old humidifiers. Hope this helps, there is no moisture coming out of the air vent. I'm a big amazon customer but, not happy with this product and this will be my first return to amazon."
1,Great Humidifier,"I know that a humidifier is for winter when the heat is on. However, I have had a congested head for 2 months. This humidifier is great. It really helps me sleep at night."
2,Vick Cool Mist (Leaking) Humidifier,"Very nice design however you can not ""easily"" move it from one place to another because the water into the humidifier leaks (overflows)""easily""."
2,"Okay for me, not for baby.","Pros-Noise is fine, similar to the whir of a fanProbably works in smaller spaces.Light weight.Cons-Doesn't seem to do it's job. Pregnancy stuffiness doesn't benefit much from this unit even when placed directly in front of my face. We have a large bedroom, so that may be the problem.Leaks slightlyWe'll get a better one for the baby!"
3,Refilling Machine,The older model of this humidifier refilled so easy but this one is very hard. My husband even has a hard time opening it and now he just pushes the spring down where the water comes out because it is easier. If you have a hard time open things do not get this model. The machine itself does work fine.
