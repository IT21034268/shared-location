4,Winning Combonation,"From Ricky's smooth voice to Christina's blaring high notes, ""Nobody Wants to Be Lonely"" is a hit. In this song, you can really hear Christina's maturity as a vocalist. Some of her idols came out in her voice in this song like Whitney and Mariah. Ricky doesn't quite get the umph behing him to compare to Christina but at least he doesn't overpower her. One person who thinks they are the best singer in the universe is enough!"
4,a little pricey,the only bad thing about it that the frames actually come out a little bit and it's horrible to change a radio station
5,adorable anime,Good art style. Super cute. Fun to watch over and over again. Made by the creators of love hina though not a harem anime.
5,As advertised,Ordered this to go along with my Weller soldering iron. Arrived on time and in good shape. Would order from again.
3,Samples,The samples are too short and the quality leaves a lot to be desired. Having said that the choices are wonderful and the price is great. If you're looking for a overview of the best of classical music then this is for you. However if it's quality you're looking for then spent the extra money and look at other choices.
3,The fit is not for me,"Sound is good, but these fit on my ears, not over them. Unless you are a gnome or something, they'll sit on top of your ears too.I prefer headphones that envelop my ears, both for sound and style. If you're OK with this kind of fit, these are a good deal."
3,Spend a little more to get a better product.,"I'll start by saying that these headphones do work. I thought I would be getting a great product because it had an original retail price of over $90, but when I received the headphones, I was underwhelmed. The actual quality does not appear to be that of a $90 product, but much more like the sale price of around $10. For what I paid, I'm certainly not complaining about what I got, but I wish that I had spent more and purchased a better product."
5,Very well built,"I've had this item for over a year. The headphone jack is starting to get damaged, but this is after a year of unbelievable abuse. I have dropped, stood on, yanked, beaten, and snapped apart this headset and it still works. Ordering another one as a replacement."
5,Great product for the price,"I needed a low-priced pair of headphones a few days ago, so I ran out and bought these. I wasn't expecting much for the price ($15), but I was pleasantly suprised. The sound quality is fine, and the bass is very good. These headphones are also quite light and extremely comfortable. The ear cups swivel up and down and side to side, so you can align them perfectly without any discomfort. The cups are nicely padded, and I have been able to wear these for upwards of 3 hours without any discomfort. Also, the headphones come with a 3 meter cable (about 10 ft.) I think this is a nice feature, and if there is too much slack you can just tie it up. All in all, these headphones are very good for what they are. They aren't close to professional quality, but they should be fine for almost all casual listeners"
4,beautifully written,"This Poetic novel is much like an extended _The Wasteland_ by T.S. Eliot. _Ka_ wraps the epics of the Indian subcontinent into a single unified whole. But by no means is this text meant to be read in a sitting--such beauty and wisdom is intense; reading it in long sittings actually gave me a headache! Nevertheless, this ""flaw"" of forcing the reader to put the text down is an integral part of the reading experience, as Calasso forces the reader to take in the stories piece by piece, like one would in listening to the performance of an epic by a singer-storyteller. One must remember that epics were performed in small pieces, each episode at an appropriate occasion (i.e., a story about a wedding at a wedding). Calasso's _Ka_ is not merely a book, but a simulation of the very experience of listening to and seeing an epic performed!"
3,Its OK,"The author writes beautifully and he can keep your attention for awhile, especially in the first few chapters. He weaves the stories of the Indian culture together beautifully but being Indian, I have heard these stories told to me by my family. The author has changed certain stories so he can better make the story flow but the changes frustrated me and I would stop reading for a few days only to pick it up back again. I haven't finished it and I doubt I will. If you have some knowledge of these stories you will appreciate this book by being able to recognize the changes."
5,Strategy and substance.....second to none!,"Joseph's draft strategy is second to none and his player evaluations gives you all the player information you could possibly need to prepare for the draft. I have been in my fantasy football league for a number of years now and have been using Joseph's book as a guide for the past 3 years. His insight and analysis have been a tremendous help to me and have helped guide me to the best record in my league and championships.For a first time fantasy owner, this book is a must and for the more seasoned owner, it is the only draft guide you need.In addition, whoever said there is no such thing as a ""free lunch"" should get this book. The last minute update that Jospeh sends out is for FREE and is spectacular, worth the price of the book in and of itself."
1,"Not labeled ""Made in China""","Not glazed on the inside, rough, retains smells and food product.Made in China...This is for food product for animals and human consumption. Had I known it was made in China, I would not have purchased it. China's record of lead and other toxic content in items meant for foodstuffs is pitiful. I do not choose to expose myself or my animals to lead poisoning. Ceramics is one of the biggest conductors of lead based glaze/paint.Very poor decision not including that important tidbit of information."
2,Not great,"Although the song selection is good, there is too much instrumental music for children and the quality of the music is good, but isn't targeted to kids. The versions are different than the typical nursery rhymes that kids hear."
4,Can't go wrong with Clapton,"No matter what Eric Clapton cd you buy, you know you will never go wrong. In a industry loaded with one time hits artist, the true artist always reign on top. Eric Clapton is one of them. With soul hits, blues playing guitars or a pop tune, Eric Clapton knows how to make a hit. Not only do you hear his music, but you feel it. You can never go wrong with Eric Clapton"
2,"Beautiful to look at, but messy","This set is very modern looking and fits right in with the stainless steel look of my kitchen. I loved it on the website, and when I received it, I was not disappointed. But, when you pour oil, you can't help but to have oil dripping down the bottle and into the well where the bottle sits. I haven't been able to stop this from happening, I try to have a paper towel ready to wipe the spout as soon as I pour, I also have tightened the top of the bottle as much as I can, but to no avail, because the oil drips from the bottom of the cover (even though it has a seemingly good rubber seal), the bottle ends up all gooey and a puddle of oil will form at the bottom. I am resigned to wash the outside of the bottle with soap and water and the caddy too after every use. Bottom line: top ratings for look, not so good for functionality."
5,Negrita amazing,"This is one of the best rock group in Italy, I was lucky enough to see them live at Hit Week in LA. Just Amazing!"
5,"Great ""Cheer a Friend Up"" Gift Book!","This book is just darling, and you'll feel good yourself after reading it. It's filled with practical hints and suggestions; the drawings are so cute. This is a great gift book for someone who's sick or recovering from an injury. You'll want one for yourself, too!"
1,"Mi opinion, escucha este CD antes de comprarlo!","Empiezo en comentar que cuando salio este CD a la venta pense que con el apoyo de Marc Anthony este proyecto iba a ser un exito. Desgraciadamente me equivoque. Bueno, la colaboracion de Marc Anthony es evidente en las canciones seleccionadas para este CD. Desafortunadamente la voz de JLO no tiene ese sentimiento para cantar estas canciones de amor. Yo no se si se precipitaron al terminar este CD porque yo tengo el DVD del primer concierto de JLO que fue grabado en la Isla del encanto y la interpretacion de varias baladas por la sexy JLO fue encantadora y ahi si escuche sentimiento cuando cantaba. Tal vez la Diva se sintio sentimental estando en Puerto Rico. En este CD no hay una cancion que me haya hecho sentir WOW. Pudo haber sido porque el Espanol no es la lengua principal de la JLO. Asi que te recomiendo que escuches este CD antes de comprarlo para que no te quejes despues de haber pagado precio completo."
1,....Oh please....,"I like her english albums...but this is terrible....sorry J Lo, I think you waisted your time and energy doing this album...."
4,JLO: The Spanish Album,"""Como Ama Una Mujer"" is the first album recorded entirely in Spanish by Jennifer Lopez. It has very good tracks, like ""Que Hiciste"" ""Me Haces Falta "" and ""Tu"", plus the title track. This special limited edition, released in the USA, comes with a bonus DVD that features the making of the music video ""Que Hiciste"" and the actual video clip. Item very scarce and hard to find. To the fans and collectors: Do not forget to purchase!"
1,Terribly Disappointed,Though her voice is good; she should stick to Pop music. Too many ballads and the soul searching lyrics. Lyrics not appropriate for her. She sings about sadness and disappointment when we all know her life is so different. The songs did not match her or what she represents to Latinos and women. Jennifer should continue to do Pop music and upbeat tempos and forget about the torch songs of pain and abandonment. Not a good match. What were her producers thinking. Hello!!!! Wasted my money. I never listen to it again.
2,Find a Way to Rent it First,"There's been a lot of good reviews bandied about for this title and admittedly, it looks good. The fine animation from Madhouse (Hellsing, serial experiments lain) again proves that they have a lot of style. The problem, however, is that the casual viewer (as well as the die-hard anime fan) will have some trouble getting through this first disc. Perhaps in the next DVD releases, one will learn what's going on but the first four episodes feel like two episodes worth of material stretched out to improbable lengths. The show drags and wanders and never quite gets to the point.Did I enjoy the show? Not really. I bought the disc based on rave reviews and probably should have found a way to rent it first. The concepts are dull and the pace is spotty and it never quite lives up to its potential. Perhaps it gets better in subsequent episodes but I don't care, I'm not picking them up."
3,Missing Second Biggest Song,"Where is ""Take A Chance On Me?"". This is one of Abba's biggest songs. I want to sing their biggest hits to musical accompaniment. Won't buy this album."
3,Good Basic Info,"Good information about PCOS, gives a general overview but doesn't give enough specific diet information for managing PCOS. Definitely recommend ""New Glucose Revolution"" for this."
1,"Really important topic, disappointing treatment of it","There seems to be a common misconception that Refactoring and Patterns are disconnected things. I had high hopes that this would be the book that cleared this misconception and tied them together.But I found the examples to be contrived, and often not deserving of the patterns that were applied. The step-by-step examples were hard to follow as they constantly gave tiny snippets of code that were missing proper context.As important as I think this topic and message is, I can't imagine this book convincing anyone who wasn't already convinced. At best, this might make a passable supplement to someone learning patterns for the first time from another source.On the bright side, some of the stories in the early chapters were entertaining, but not enough to recommend this derivative work."
4,"The other reviews say it all, really.","To sum it up nicely, this is a good book, very good. I could have lived without all the XML/DOM, though, but still the kind of quality you can usually expect from Addison Wesley publishing."
1,An abuse of psychoanalysis for political purposes,"I bought this book as the title interested me and because I find the work of many contempoary Arab writers fascinating. However, this book is very distressisng as it is merely an attack on the goals and values of a leading woman reformer,"
1,"nothing fit, I will return the item",the westin 63000 fey diamondstep black rear utility bumper did not fit. the holes would not lined up and brackets were incorrect.
2,Beginner stuff,"This book is strictly for beginners, and it should say so in the title.Buy it if you need information about uses for a cable release, how bad you'll need a tripod, the differences between compact and SLR cameras, what a polarizing filter is for, how to change the white balance settings, and much more basic stuff, like always carry spare batteries and buy many memory cards now that they are cheap.Oh, the featured photos are quite good, but in that case treat yourself straight up with a big coffee table book."
2,Too stuffy,"I didn't like this book because it was unrealistic in it's portrayal of New Yorkers--they sounded more like Englishmen. Also, the supernatural angle didn't appeal to me.It's very hard to have an unlikeable protagonist, and I don't think it worked in this case.Lastly, even though I didn't like the book as a whole, it did have a lasting impact--as opposed to your typical fluff mystery."
1,This is a DVD-R!,The DVD of Alakazam the Great sold by Sterling is only a poor DVD-R copy! And be warned...if you leave a negative feedback for these clowns they will send you emails trying to get you to remove the rating. I received no less than three such emails before I blocked them.
1,not worth it...,"i echo the complaints about the assembly instructions being the worst i have run into ever. but that is the least of this unit's problems:1. base of the unit itself is bent/bowed and as result the ledge the grills sit on is also bowed and the grills fall into the bottom of the base rendering the unit unusable.2. got the smoker also and it didnt fit correctly-turns out they shipped spacers that are too long. they sent me replacement spacers...and they are even LONGER than the originals so i had to modify them myself.3. paint blistered off the smoker on the first use and the fire wasnt even hot enough to get the cooking space to their recommended cooking temperature. i know they point out that this might happen but how come every other grill manufacturer uses paint that can handle high temperatures?4. because of the bow in the unit, the top and bottom dont close tight enough to retain the heat generated by the attached smoker.i gave it a one because you can't give zero's."
2,Arrived severely damaged,"I ordered this grill with high hopes and was incredibly disappointed. The first thing I noticed was the charcoal grates having broken welds and bent bars. Before putting it together, I contacted Char-Griller and was told to send them the serial number stamped somewhere on the grill and they would send me a replacement part. I can't find a stamped serial number anywhere on the thing. I then went and put everything together and when I pulled out the cooking grates, they were ALL broken. Some in pieces and some just broken at joints, barely holding together. I don't know what they did to this thing, but it looks like Amazon opened the box and smashed up individual pieces. How the hell do you break METAL grates like that?!"
4,"Cool, affordable charcoal grill","Just what I was looking for, a quality, affordable, large chacoal grill. Nice cast iron grates, huge grilling area, rugged construction, easy assembly, nice charcoal tray/holder, all for around $200 bucks. Ain't nothing wrong with that."
2,Doesn't work...,"I was pretty excited about this, but it doesn't work very well at all. the narrow mouth on the food processor means that you have to cut the potato into halves/quarters to fit. then the disk just ends up making little potato chunks, in addition to just shredding/wasting a bunch of potato."
3,Not my favorite Carly book,Enjoyable quick read. Light on emotional connection and not enough humor. Even the it is my least favorite Carly book I would still recommend because the series gets better.
1,This phone sucks,"No need to write a long, drawn out review. In short, I have had this phone for exactly one year so far and it has been babied. It can no longer hold a charge, the ability to store multiple numebrs a a single name doesn't exist, and the useability is fairly lame."
1,Reliability problems- do not buy!,"had the identical problem as previous writer. The phone's exterior display does not recognize when the phone is closed, so it always shows ""verizon"" instead of the time/caller ID. This is a problem because when I open the phone, it does flicker on, then off, thus hanging up on the person! When I went to return it, the guy in the store confessed that another customer had a similar problem.should be replaced soon. hopefully will get a good one."
1,Known defect!,"I have a v260 which is basically the same as this phone. I decided to write in the V265 review area becuase v260 can no longer be found on amazon. Anyways, I'm on my third phone and when I went to go get it the people at verizon said that there is a KNOWN defect with this phone and that it usually breaks after about 2 months on average. Why should I have to keep getting this same phone if there is a KNOWN defect? Unbelievable!!!"
4,"Great carrier, Great phone!","First off, Verizon Wireless has superior coverage and a great network. I love the phone, battery life better then all the phones ive had in the past and ive had maybe 5 or 6 phones already.Has all the features like txt messaging,voice dialing,mobile web and can download ringtones,games, wallpapers etc. everything works really well. The only thing wrong with this phone is the camera isnt as great as other Motorola phones. i know a couple people with Motorola V400's and their camera is noticably better then the V265's camera, But other then that everything is great on this phone."
1,Isn't working!,"I am sad to report that I have not noticed even the tiniest decrease in my appetite or cravings. I looked at Hoodithin's website and they say you can take up to four doses of this a day (one dose = 30 drops, which they say is one droppful, but I counted the drops and to get 30 you need almost two droppers). I hoped taking the maximum allowed would make a difference, but it hasn't. I'll give it a few more days before I give up entirely. Luckily, they have a money-back guarantee."
4,"Hey, It Works!","If there is a reward for truth in advertising, this book would win. The bi-monthly magazine Cooks Illustrated has a column it calls ""Quick Tips""; it is a collection of handy tips and tricks in the kitchen, many of which will make your life easier. This book is a well chosen collection of 365 of these tips.Every tip has an illustration, even those that do not really need one. For those (like me) who do not subscribe to this magazine regularly, a collection of these valuable tips is nice to have. Even those who do subscribe will find it useful, as all the tips are alphabetized. The kitchen jobs that are the most troublesome, such as pies and cakes, each yield several tips.On the other hand, this is a rather randow collection of tips. There is no effort to cover the most troublesome kitchen problems, or to be comprenhensive."
1,$7.99 for an electronic version of a book you can get used for $0.01?,"I've read this in paperback and the story is quite good. This review, however, is in regards to an e-book price that is out-of-step with modernity. Seems to me Pocket Books is missing an opportunity here. The Star Trek back catalog prices ought to be $2.99 for out-of-print titles IMHO. That's what would get me to buy. $7.99 is a ridiculous price, considering that the paper book is no longer in print, I can buy a used copy for $0.01, and the ebook doesn't have X-Ray enabled."
3,Politics Politics...,"Not a bad book, but too much politics make for boring Star Trek to me. I did enjoy certain elements of this book but I don't think I enjoyed it as a whole all that much. Worth reading though if you are a completist and not to mention it's the Titans maiden voyage. So you pretty much have to read it :)"
2,Just not fun to read - confusing characters,"I really wanted to like this series. I bought the first three. the characterization is what kills it. I know the author is trying to take advantage of the diversity of species in populating the starship with an amalgam of species that we've never heard of. However, there comes a point where the reader needs to relate to the characters. I cant relate to a sentient arachnid, or a doctor who looks like a walking dinosaur, or an intelligent bovine creature. If this was it, i could deal with it - but there are at least ten non-humanoid characters one must keep track of at a time. Visualizing each as the plot grinds along gives me a headache! It just isn't fun."
5,One of my two favorite Star Trek books,"This story was refreshing and engaging. It was reminiscient of other Star Trek books, but also had a new and unique style that made it exceptionally interesting. One of the central themes is that Titan has the most diverse crew in the Federation. I appreciated the attempt at dealing with a difficult, real world issue in a meaningful way, while in no way breaking up adventure and excitement of the story.The ship culture of Titan is also my favorite of all the Star Trek books I've read. The feeling is informal and friendly, but also thoughtful and professional. The depiction of the crew emphasizes informality and camaradie, while also focusing on the crew's thoughtful reflection and professional bearing."
3,Good Book,"A good overview of the subject.Some of the minor critisisms are warranted,such as win chung using a three knuckle landing also,and the fact that he contradicts himself on the value of eastern martial arts.Although boxings value is as much in what it leaves out as what it includes.The author recomends reading 'Championship Fighting,explosive punching and aggresive defense'by Jack Dempsey, and I couldn't agree more.If you do you will see where many of the authors ideas originated and appreciate why Dempsey was if nothing else a phenomenal puncher.The explanation of punching technique is more detailed and clearer,but doesn't cover the 'dirty' aspects of boxing for the street like Mr Beaumonts book."
1,Author is disingenuous....,"This author, in this book, extolls the wonders of boxing, claiming it is the ultimate martial art. But why then did he subsequently (1 year later) write a street-wrestling book extolling the virtues and effectiveness of wrestling techniques and takedowns as the ultimate martial art????"
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Behave around the relatives.When Wolverine takes one of the above, of the young teenage girl variety on a day outing, he scares the hell out of her when he gets more than grumpy with some of the people running sidehows at the local fair. The grumpiness comes from anti-mutant prejudice when he displays a good arm.So, he decides to give himself some psychological therapy, which is what most of the rest is about.It is pretty, in that early 21st century style, but pretty average with that, I think."
5,Transformers Voyager Megatron,"I bought this for my grandson on (his) very specific instructions. It is durable, transforms, and has been one that he played with for longer than a week. It's well worth the money, and will be, I believe, a collector's item someday to boot."
4,Outdoor shower,"Tent is quite easy to assemble. It is roomy, so even a large person wouldbe comfortable showering. We set the tent up in our living room at home as apractice. Haven't used it yet this summer, but am looking forward to showerswhile camping."
5,Good book,"I felt as I was going thru the long yet well worthed journey myself. True, unbiased, informative yet touching.I had the privilege of working with Tom for many years in which I experienced his honesty, courage and strong will firsthand."
3,Beware! This is a collection of two books already printed!,"If you have ""Origami Today, Mythical Beings"" and ""Origami Today, Lifestyle Origami"", both by the same author, Jay Ansill, do not buy this book, because it is just these two book in one. Nothing new. If you do not have these books, then this is a good book, although the models are not very good, but the decorations are very pretty."
4,the traditions of irish music,"we have all grown up listening to new releases with an ear for hit tunes, or at least catchy tunes.Van comes from a tradition of the same tunes being played over and over in pubs, and town meeting halls. This same history exists with delta music and the blues of the deep south, all Van resources. Hymns to the Silence was brilliant to us, but not that different to Van, I would guess. He is more a minstrel than a superstar.This is great liustening music, and would be great to hear in a pub....so its great morrison."
4,"Roomy, well padded, and comfortable, but not enough small compartments","I purchased this backpack as a replacement for my Kensington 62238 Contour backpack. I travel regularly, and need a single carry-on bag that can fit the essentials, since you are only allowed one carry-on bag on airplanes now. The Kensington is excellent for my 15.4 inch screen laptop and has plenty of small and snug compartments for other small electronic accessories (PDA, iPOD, earbuds, GPS, etc). However, it does not have enough additional room for books/magazines, and emergency change of clothes (in case the luggage is lost).This Targus TXL617 can accomodate my laptop well, and can handle larger laptops. It is roomy enough to suit my needs with small electronics, change of clothes, and hygiene kit. However, unlike the Kensington, it does not have small compartments to fit small electronics snugly."
4,very good bag for the price,"I bought my first laptop, a 17"" one, without realizing how heavy it would be, or that almost no bags will hold a laptop of that size. I found this bag and bought it. It is a very nice backpack and will work for lots of things besides laptop storage. You could use it for camping or traveling or any number of uses. There are a million little compartments, which satisfies the overly-organized of us! It seems very sturdy. I do find that it tips over when loaded up, like some others have found, but all in all I am very happy with my purchase."
3,Fits large laptops,"This backpack is the only pack that fits a Lenovo W700ds, that I have found.The quality is not nearly as good as ""Mobile Edge"" brand backpacks, but it should last 6 months to a year for travelers."
3,"Targus TXL617 17"" XL Notebook Backpack","This bag is very big and spacious. Lots of storage space for everything you need. Since I bought it on-line, I didn't realize just how big it was until I received it and tried it on. Then I noticed it was too big. But I used it anyway.Unfortunately, after only six months of use, this bag tore on the inside by the carrying handle on top. The seem gave way due to a manufacturer defect in sewing. I sent the bag back to Targus and was given my choice of an equal or lesser value bag because this one is no longer produced. That's great, but it's been three weeks since I shipped the bag back to Targus and I still don't have a replacement bag. Luckily, I have my old Targus satchel bag that pulls on my shoulder and rubs against my pants as a temporary substitute. Can't wait to get my new bag from Targus."
5,It Takes A Whackin' and Keeps On Packin',"This backpack is virtually indestructible. I have purchased 2 others for my high school boys, who carry all of their textbooks & laptop throughout the school day. I bought my high school junior the first one and he just completed his freshman year in college. That backpack is still in great shape, and I expect my other 2 sons' to get through college with theirs! There is plenty of room for books, notebooks, the laptop, and even a waterbottle without having an overwhelming number of compartments. The laptop is well protected in its padded compartment. The only change I'd recommend to Targus is to add some color choices for those of us who purchase more than one."
4,Great bag for all your stuff,"I needed a backpack to carry multiple, irregular-sized items, not to mention a laptop and some computer peripherals. I chose this bag because of its large size, storage capacity, and price. I've used it now for over a month, and I am very pleased with it. I use it for the following items:1) 13-inch laptop and power adapter;2) MICR reader with its power adapter and USB cable;3) Expandable binder for documents;4) Two collapsible baskets (with wooden handles); and5) Several pens, pencils, etc.The straps are very comfortable, and the sturdy top handle is well positioned, providing stability when in use. The numerous zippered pockets are a great feature, too.The only negative comment is that the prongs of the adapters can get caught in the netting/mesh of the interior compartments. I have to be careful to position the adapters, which isn't a deal-breaker.All in all, this is a great back for anyone who has lots of stuff to lug around."
5,The best case I've ever seen or used,"It is the best designed case I have ever seen! I have looked at probably 100 cases in the last two months and they were all sorely lacking. This is perfect from the size, to the weight (almost nothing!), to the pockets and how they are configured to the strap that wraps around your shoulder.It really is a perfect case. While others may be uber cool because they are leather or patterned or designer branded, this is the ticket for the serious user who wants to carry everything and have their system protected. Good job,Targus!"
5,Well built and roomy,"I bought this backpack for walking to work each day with my laptop and various other items I need to carry back and forth (umbrella, lunch, spare battery, paper, etc). It's well designed and constructed and has fulfilled all my expectations. Its size allows me to carry a hefty foldup umbrella which can lie horizontally. I was concerned it size might make it intrusive or awkward, but it's not.My only minor complaint is that the buckles on the shoulder straps slip gradually and need to be tightened every couple of days."
3,worth the money if you have no ther options,"I needed a 17"" laptop backpack for a trip and this is what I found on short notice. I have already broke one of the front clips while trying to pull it out from under a seat on a plane. I did do quite a bit of riding with this pack on through the hills of Santa Barbara and will give it credit for being resonably comfortable for long periods of wearing it. I own a 15.4"" Eastsport backpack also and that one is set up a lot better with more convienient side pockets and secondary pockets inside the larger storage areas. The Eastsport also has an air pack at the small of your back that can be adjusted which really does help to keep the laptop from feeling like a board against your back (The Targus pack did not and you could really feel the shape of the laptop).I will look at other brands than targus next time for a decent 17"" pack."
5,Awesome... really big enough,"I was looking for a BIG travel bag which is quite handy and easy to use! and this is exactly what I was looking for. Good size, nice set of compartments, lots of pockets etc etc... I really loved the backpack!"
2,way too big,"I go this for a 16in laptop but the bag was huge, much to big for a student to carry around school. I felt as though I could stash a small child in there. I opted for the Targus Gravity, still fits my laptop and still the same good bag construction."
4,Big and Functional. Great value!,"There are more backpack becoming available for 17 inch widescreen laptops, but there are not THAT many. The Targus XL is plenty big enough, and it seems well built. It's almost too big. I gave it four stars on compartments because the quick-release flap could be enclosed. Then there would be no danger of dropping whatever you put in the webbing. But maybe that has a use I am just not familiar with. The same issue is the four stars for comfort. The backpack seems to hang a little because of the width of the compartments and the ""looseness"" of the quick release flap.There are similar sized bags, but in my searching they all cost more. If you need the space for a large laptop, give this one consideration. I am happy with mine."
5,Wonderful with lots of space to carry your stuff.,Love it so much. great since I carry my books and laptop with me to work.Compared to other bags...this really rocks.
4,A big bag enough to hold everything,"Since I carry a few books, files and a lunch box in a bag, I need a big one. (Most of the university text books are so large)This bag can hold what I need."
5,Targus TXL617 17 XL Notebook Backpack,I love this backpack and it holds so much stuff that I was able to carry my large laptop and all the accessories plus a bunch of books. I love all the little pockets for organizing things too.
1,Zippers fail,"This bag has a lot of room for just about anything you would want to carry in a backpack. The padded compartment is perfect for a 17"" laptop. I have been using minefor two years now and the zippers on three of the most useful and obviously most used compartments have already failed. Considering the price of this bag, I amextremely disappointed in it.I would not recommend this bag unless you can get it for a price at which you don'tmind replacing it again in two years."
2,poor choice,"This product has great space and size, but these are far out weighed by its middle of road construction and lack of ergonomic features.Using it properly for any length of time(over 15 min) is uncomfortable. It needs a breathable back and better shoulder straps as well as more durable construction."
4,Bigger is better !,"I was actually amazed the laptop (Toshiba P500, 18.4"" screen) actually fit, and there is a bit of room to spare. There are so many pockets I think I am carrying around stuff just to use the space. The straps are the best, the feel of it being stable when it's on my back is great, doesn't flop around even if I don't have it pulled that tight to my body.Awesome product if you have the need for something bigger. I'm almost tempted to get another one for those long weekends away from home."
2,Unsatisfactory,Padding in the laptop sleeve is completely insufficient.Plastic adjustment components on straps have all been broken.No cross chest straps.
4,"Really, really big","This bag is possibly too big for the average person's needs and not aesthetically pleasing. There are quite a few sub-compartments (anyone carrying multiple laptops and not minding if the smaller laptop doesn't have a padded sleeve?), which can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your needs. The shoulder straps look like they aren't padded well enough, though in actual use they seem ok to me."
3,Ok Gun,"I got this gun I was so excited look cool online, got the gun went to an airsoft place, suppose to be 350 FPS but its over 400 which was great. Went airsofting with my friends in the woods and I was owning but then my switch for the semi and auto broke so I'm always on semi. Also the handle broke off on the front. Plus now my guns broken and its passed 30 days so I can't return it, it feels jammed and I don't have any clue why its jammed. Don't buy the gun, read reviews before you buy a gun."
5,Very intimidating gun,"When i first got the gun it fired ok, but kept jamming. I eventually lubed it up with some silicon spray and it fired beutifully. It is somewhat accurate with a great rate of fire, and it just looks intimidating.Mag holds up to 600 bb's which is insane. Great gun for the money. The only problem is the selector switch which comes loose alot. Overall a great buy."
5,Amazing!!!!!,"I have had this gun for a couple weeks now and it is amazing, I got it chrono'd the other day and it shoots around the 425 fps mark, And is incredibley accurate. The quad rails are amazing they'll fit practically and optic or accesory your trying to put on.Pros:Metal GearboxHigh FPSComes with high cap magVery DurableHigh Capacity BatteryIncredibley accurateSolid BuildAwesome pistol gripForegripQuad RailsCons:I have had some electrical problems with itThe rails are plasticOverall Great Gun."
1,Bad gun - don't buy,Save up your money and buy a better ak. It says it is all metal but some parts are plastic. The mag is horrible and flimsy and causes the gun to fire multiple rounds at once. You'll thank me when you don't buy this gun. Run away. Run far away. Don't order guns off of amazon. Period. I wish I could put 0 stars. Order off of AirsoftGI.com
5,buy this gun KNOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I got this gun a few weeks Ago. just when I opened the box I had a felling it was going to rock.The batteries take 3 hours and 20 minutesto charge. it was finally time to shoot it was awsome the the automatic didn't shoot very straight but it still was very good .the single shot is very good. This is the best gun i have. but this gun is not for people that have just started shoot airsoft guns. IT is heavey to it is around 10 pounds. this is the best gun you will buy.
1,TERRIBLE,the gun worked well for the first 30 shots but jammed right away and i am unable to return it when the gun worked it was great and extremely powerful but still jammed right away if didnt jam and worked %100 of the time i would have given it 5 stars
3,ok gun,the gun itself is good is shoots fairly well with a great fps and rate of fire but one problem is the guns fire select broke within a month of having it other than that it is a nice gun
5,worth every penny.,"Well... if you love Korean dramas like Boys Over Flowers, Coffee Prince then you will lOVE this. I got this for my sister for her birthday and ended up shipping it to her address because she is away for college - it got to her in 2 days!She opened it and it was nicely packaged and everything.Honestly there isn't anything I would say bad about this!"
5,Wonderful Drama,Keeps you spell bound and cheering for all of them. love Cn Blue and Ft Island then you wll like the ost also.
5,Old Fashioned Recipes,"I found these recipes to be similar to ones my Southern grandmother made. They were easy to make and full of flavor. The taste is far superior to that of the typical store-bought fare. Jelly and jam making is not hard, but finding a good recipe seems to be an ordeal. (I did write off my first jelly making session as a lesson learned, but that was before this book came to my attention.)"
5,Wonderful canning book for beginners to experts!,"Linda Amendt shares her fabulous recipes and secrets to championship canning success in this attractive and well-laid-out book of recipes. Although most buyers will probably be seasoned canners, she covers the basic procedures and equipment for newbies, then goes right into food selection and prep.The recipes include everything from delicious jams and jellies to homecanned soups and stews and sauces. This book is a must-have for any avid canner, and would make a nice gift if combined with a waterbath canner and some jars for someone who's always wanted to try canning but never had the nerve. Highly recommend"
5,Awesome!,"I'm honestly not 100% sure how this works, but it does! I give it to my daughter, who loves it, though it seems tasteless to me, and it calms her down! It also helps when I'm not sure if it's her teeth that are bothering her, I try this, and if she doesn't calm down, it's probably something else. When teething started the advice I was given was just give her Tylenol. And nothing against the stuff, but I didn't want to give it to her all the time. This really calms her down when she has the teething fussies."
4,Excellent ending,"Fans of The Last Rune won't be dissapointed by the series' conclusion. Mark Anthony wraps everything up well, three years from the ending of The Gates of Winter. Well-written; presents some excellent ideas.Admittedly, there are one or two awkward moments; but even so, this book is worth reading."
1,noise pollution,"Listening to this CD isn't enjoyable. Roberto Cantoral wrote many fine boleros, but the way they are rendered here is disappointing. It's not the arrangements, which are OK, but the singer, whose voice is mediocre and fails to do justice to her father's compositions. When it comes to singing, she's just another pretty face who can't carry a tune. Music lovers are advised to look elsewhere for these songs. Indeed, it's hard to find a bolero collection without at least one selection by Roberto Cantoral, usually ""El reloj"" or ""La barca."" Good renditions of his songs are readily available on CDs by Luis Miguel, Victor Yturbe and Alberto Vazquez, among many others."
4,It's ok,"Works well at reducing red bumps and inflammation after shaving, etc...The only ""Kalo"" product that actually works. It's a bit expensive though."
1,Tend skin knock off,Horrible just like Tend Skin. Try Princereigns or Min they actually work and dont burn your face off like Tend Skin or Magic Shave
5,Just A Great Book,"This is one of my favorites of the cold war fictions. I loved the location descriptions and choices; you start in North American and just keep going east. This is a smart, fun book that gives the reader a great story and a lot of interesting historical facts about Russia. This really is a book that has two - three very well developed and written plot twists that makes you stay on your toes. I have reread the book and it is something how well he places the road signs. This is a great book; unfortunately he was not able to keep up this form into his next."
1,Who Wrote This Parker Novel???,"Well...after reading ALL the reviews...I ordered it. I read it. And I ask ""who wrote this Parker book?? I see NONE of him in it and have read the man for years and years. It was an okay read but no snap...no smart mouths..blah endings to what could have been so much more BobbyBoy!! I DID like the ending but even that was sort of oatmeal. Sorry, Robert, whereever you are!!"
3,Nice poster but arrived wrinkled,"This poster had to make a very long trip in the mail to my location and it arrived with the cardboard tube partially crushed. The shipper packages the poster in a cardboard tube with the ends crimped instead of capped which allowed debris to pass into the packaging container. Consequently the poster was a little soiled in addition to being wrinkled when it arrived. I ordered similar posters from other vendors and these products arrived in perfect condition, due to plastic end caps in the cardboard tubes. Other than the packaging issues, the poster was great."
4,Great for the Price,"Just had my local mechanic put it on my 1999 Dodge Ram 1500 today with the additional installation pack. Looks great, but the holes still have to be drilled (ovaled) in order to lower/tilt the bumper enough so the tail gate can open fully."
2,These suck,"These suck. They are huge and barely fit in my ears - they really don't fit in my ears - and I don't have particularly small ears. They don't do anything to screen outside noise, they are extremely trebly, so much so that I have to turn them down to a very low level with many bands."
2,Huge ear buds.,These have to be the most uncomfortable earbuds I have ever worn. The size makes me feel like I have tiny ears. I don't. The sound is decent for the price.
4,Very nice for the price,"If you're looking for inexpensive earbuds, these are just fine. The sound quality isn't A+, (I'd give 'em a solid B) they are as good as you can expect from cheap earbuds. Even though they are big, they fit in my ear snugly, and with no discomfort even when using them for extended periods (they're made out of a soft plastic). I had Panasonic earbuds before these that were A+ in my opinion, however they have been discontinued. These are just fine though. If you are looking for A+ earbuds, try Klipsch Image S4's. They have amazing sound quality, though I'm not crazy about how they fit in my ear. They have audiophile level sound, though they're a little pricy."
4,"Large Earbud, Okay for Budget Model","My kids seem to go through earbuds so there is no reason to buy anything that I don't care about if they lose them.And they don't like the in ear buds with the silicone tips. But the style, like this one, is getting harder to find. So these were the right price.They sound okay and suit the purpose for them. But the earbud ends are pretty big, much bigger than iPod buds that are the same style. My kids don't seem to mind though.The green is really an aqua like green."
5,Great value,"These are not the most comfortable or best sounding earbuds I've owned, but for the price, they're a terrific deal. Will probably purchase these again whenever I inevitably lose/break the pair I have."
2,Too bulky,"These headphones have OKAY sound quality. The biggest problem with them is that they are waaaaayyyyy too bulky. They don't fit in my ears, and I don't have tiny ears by any means. Definitely do not recommend."
1,SUCKS!,"These headphones are terrible! Way different than what other people say on the page....If I didnt know any better, I would say the positive reviews are scams....DONT BUY THEM!!!"
1,Bad,Terrible hurt in your ears and cheaply made product. The wires split and cant be used. This was a waste of my time and money. Wont order again!
2,VERY uncomfortable,"These headphones have great sound, but the discomfort is too much to handle. After wearing these for about 30 minutes, my ears were hurting, and the pain was even worse after I took them out, which lasted for another 20 minutes or so. Maybe they would fit better on other people, but for me they were miserable."
3,Not Bad,"These headphones have great sound and some interesting features, but they lack comfort. After about thirty minutes they start to get pretty rough on the ears."
4,Good quality for a great price!,"I paid about $6.00 for these Panasonic ear buds and I am very impressed with the overall quality for the price. The buds are on the larger side but they fit perfect for me and have a nice, crisp sound. I hate to pay a lot of money for ear buds that I lose all the time so these worked out great. I ordered a red pair but I've already ordered another pair in white since I liked these so much."
1,"If used for exercising, get something else","3 months and these are already failing at the jack. That small hole in the picture (below the sideways ""L"") allows sweat inside the earphone and kills all bass until shaken/blown out. Get something else."
3,Mediocre,"I'm a little disappointed in these earbuds -- the sound is a bit tinny and they don't fit in my ears very securely. With all the glowing reviews I was excited that they were so inexpensive, but I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Do not buy,First of all the buds are too big to fit comfortably in anyone's ear and after about a week the sound stopped working. Most purchase I have ever made on Amazon.
3,Too Big,Good quality and nice color but theyre too large for my ears and keep falling out! Id recommend this product to someone with larger ears.
1,Not that great,"These earbuds were crap. The sound quality is just horrible, and it sounds all wrong. It's almost like white noise in the background or something, I don't even know how to describe it. I've used Panasonic Jellies before, and these looked similar, but I cannot stand the sound. I think I'm done with Panasonic."
4,Good inexpensive backup,"I'm now on my 4th pair, but for the $$, no biggie. Great sound; always a great backup when the BT phones die. Need some inexpensive earbuds that sound great and are fairly durable? Get these ..."
4,Cheap but decent with some minor flaws,"For a cheap price, these earphones are great. The only problem is that I have problem keeping them on my ears."
3,Panasonic earbuds.,"The fit on these earphones eis a little peculiar. They don't really go into the ear, they kind of hang on the external ear above the lobe. The sound is good and works well for various MP3 players. The cord is long enough."
3,Just okay...,"First off, the picture makes it look like the ear covers are bigger then they really are. I don't have big ears by any means, but these things still don't cover them well. It also feels pretty flimsy, and the wire is really thin. In terms of sound quality, it's nothing to get excited about but it works decently."
4,Good product,"The headphones work fine. They are pretty much what I expected and the adapter that comes with it can be used on other headphones as well. I didn't like that I could only purchase 1 item because I needed 4 so there was a little confusion when I tried to purchase all 4 and the processing was cut off. Anyway, I'd probably purchase again because the product and timing were fine."
4,headphones,ok headphones not the best works fine does not handle a lot of power or bass but stills sound good well worth the money.
5,"Tiny, adorable","This little pitcher is very very cute. It is quite small, which I expected, but please make sure you understand the size if you are thinking about ordering. This is cute for creamer, or a little bit of syrup on the table, or for decorative purposes."
1,Don't Fall For This Trap!,"Most Tax protesters have ended up paying high penalties or worse, in jail.Left-wingers are buying this book like crazy to show their support for ""peace"". But I thought they were in favor of taxes. I guess when someone takes their money and spends it on a program they don't like, its wrong. But when someone with a different political view wants taxes to stop funding left-wing causes they call it selfishness. Real hypocrites. Pay your taxes, stay out of jail. If you're really upset, try voting sometime..."
1,"Badly organized, verbose, frustrating.","This is about the hardest-to-use computer language book I've ever encountered. Its ""conversational"" tone reads like a ceaseless wandering monologue. Frequently Libes introduces a new concept, and proceeds to meander into philosophy, opinion, history, advanced uses, and problems encountered therein. It is *much* too long; it's badly organized; it's useless as a reference manual. I would pay big bucks for ANY other book on Expect, but unfortunately there doesn't appear to be one. Libes created a very powerful and useful tool, but he doesn't write well, IMHO."
2,I 'Expect'ed more from this book,"This book ranks right down there with so many of O'Reilly's Books. It has a terrible index, examples that bear no resemblance to anything at all real-worldish, and simple problems/solutions are ignored entirely. Too bad there are so few alternatives.Enter ""Expect TCL"" into a Google search and you'll come up with somevaluable info that you'll need to compliment this lousy book fromO'Reilly.Then get yourself a good book on TCL also."
4,A very good book dealing with interaction automation,A definite buy to aid in automation of interactiive processess. A stepwise introduction. Most of the actual and useful examples are at the later stage of the book.
2,Not worth it.,"These lamps are very cute, but they don't stay lit for very long.Maybe a couple of hours at the most. Would not purchase again."
5,Great but where's the rest,Really enjoyable and great graphics and prompt delivery but I was expecting to receive the whole lot i.e. the other volumes
5,Fantastic!,My son and I love this DVD! Great for kids and dads alike. Has a real good Star Wars feel to it.Lucas should have watched this before writing Episodes I & II.
1,Bad cartoon but great Jedi Cameos!,"This was an abomination and an absolute insult to my intelligence. I wasn't sure what to expect from this, but I at least expected a plot. It's just a bunch of ludicrous battle sequences. Basically the battles are ten times as big as any battle in the movies (in terms of combatants), but the Jedi are about 1,000 times as powerful. An entire hour of watching each Jedi take out droids by the dozen was a little much. Ignoring all of that . . . battles aren't nearly as cool when it's a cartoon.Overall, this isn't worth wasting your time on. However, my wife and I did get a good couple of laughs when we noticed that one of the Jedi the shown at the end of the battle with the banker's guild looked like Michael J. Fox from Teenwolf, and that the cameo by Jedi Master Shaggy as part of the group battling General Grievous. It's just too bad he didn't have Scooby and the Mystery Machine to aid his cause..."
4,A very cool compliment to the star wars movies,"The animation is great, its extremely fast paced and it seems to avoid the parts that have made the prequels so bad, the dialouge. Because the cartoon is purely action with very little dialouge the story flows smoothly and never gets boring. The voice acting that is used is top notch and sounds great, I did not look at the credits to see if any of the actual actors voices were used, but they sound close. I am waiting for volume 2 to come out because I am sure it will be even better than this one is. All of the episodes are strung together in one long movie making for a very seamless experience. If you had not seen the episodes individually you would never known it was split up in the first place. A great purchase for any star wars fan."
4,well made and action packed,I heard from a friend that this was good and it is. This is very action packed and does a good job of illustrating the clone wars. Very little is known about the clone wars except for the books so this helps visually show the clone wars.
3,Meh,"This series was okay, but, as other people have stated, it's just a giant action sequence.I'm the kind of nerd who makes himself a fan of 1 specific character and I chose General Grievous as soon as I learned about him on some rumor forums.This cartoon is the only place where you can enjoy General Grievous. He's totally gimped in the movie, but watching him mow down Jedi in the cartoon makes me giggle.Other than the parts with Grievous in them, the series is nigh-unwatchable. If you like the creator's artwork, go buy Samurai Jack."
4,"Good, thought the second series is better","The first volume of the animated Clone Wars is quite good. The characters are well done and the stories are interesting, though so fast paced and compressed that we don't get enough of the characters themselves.Hopefully, the second set of longer adventures, which can now been seen on StarWars.com, will soon be available on DVD. These feature better character developement and lead directly into the movie."
3,Confused,"I found this book to be all over the place and difficult to follow. I liked the female characters but just couldn't understand this type of writing. Descriptive yet frustrating. Too much work for me to enjoy, however, a talented writer."
5,Everbody Wins Here,"The core of this film involves a teenager and how he copes with the world around him. There are no simple answers here but a refreshing look at a young man with an abusive and manipulative parent who runs away to a grandfather he's never met. A lawyer takes over his guardianship in an informally way and things evolve in strange and wonderful ways. It turns out that the lawyer coaches wrestling on the side and that his young ward is a champion wrestler! No, this isn't a sports film - not at all - nor is it an ""angry young man"" sterotype. The young man is in the simple sentence time of life and we don't hear as much as we feel about him. What is amazing in this mixture is the humor when we least expect it. There are scenes or just snips of dialog that are screamingly funny. The literalists might question if these things would actually happen in real life.Probably not, but who's counting?Curtis Stotlar"
4,Wonderful Whimsical Poems,"Sheila's poems make me say...hey...hold me a room at the Aqua Clara. There is such life and urgency in her poems that they tell stories that you want to witness for yourself. Some of her poems read like lymerics. Loved her ""sea"" poems. Poems like ""the man who pissed in the dresser,"" ""the born again newlyweds,"" ""the hickey kids,"" and ""the old vet and his wife,"" pull you into everyday life at the Aqua Clara's Front Desk and makes you say...wish I was there..."
2,Cheap,I should have listened to the other reviewers. This thing is entirely plastic. And the alarm is lame; so quick and quiet I completely miss it when it goes off.
1,stale,candy was very stale. i didnt send it back because i had to pay for it. i usually get great service from amazon but not this time. i just chalk it up as a loss.thanks bob delp
5,Amazing Service and Product,"I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER!!After having several negative experiences with another seller of this same product, I wrote to this supplier asking for prompt service and many questions - and i got the answers to each and every one of them, sometimes within a matter of minutes of my email being sent! (No mean feat considering I am in Australia and the supplier is U.S!!)My products were sent super quick (and received within 5 days even though on the amazon site it says 10 days plus) and the costumes were exactly as I had hoped for. Measurements were true to size, and looked great on.Definately a pleasurable Amazon experience. I would absolutely use this supplier again!! THANKYOU!!"
5,Kids loved it,"The series was what my kids were watching on Teennick. Now they can view the show anytime they wish, thanks."
4,Olympus D7AC 110V AC Adapter,Good quality AC adapter that is almost a must have if you use your digital camera often. Good thing to have.
2,Based on Entity-Relationship modelling,"Be aware entity-relationship modelling is considered harmful, being incapable of representing a full, detailed relational model and even being misleading quite often.Since this book is based on ERM, it won't be ever a definitive reference. It may have other qualities."
5,A highly evocative collection of historical country photos.,"These black and white photos, along with the recollections of the author, conjure up an intriguing look back at country fairs - something that goes well beyond the simple nostalgia that one might expect from such a collection. The photos are touching and powerful, and reveal elements of both the human and animal condition in regards to such fairs. Things like the burlesque shows may be a thing of the past, and these photos perhaps show why as Fish looks at both the girls on show and those who watched them with a detached and objective eye. A fine book altogether - especially for those interested in photo-realism or historical archives. The images speak on a number of levels...which is, in the end, the measure of a good photograph."
2,Beware - devious female,"No Spoilers...This is the first Sherryl Wood's book I have read. I hope this is not the best example of her writing as I thought there was far too much repetitive dialogue for the first 3/4 of the book. When I purchased, I did not realize this was the third in a series and for those of you who have not read the second book, ""A Slice of Heaven"", this book does a quick review in the book and may spoil it for you.There were lots of characters and little sub-stories in this book, but none of the storylines were well developed. I particularly had an issue with the main story that featured Helen, a lawyer who is touted as being ethical and highly respected. She does something devious that as a woman I found hard to stomach. Her decision showed her to be a self-centered narcissus. Wood's writing glossed over the controversy between her and the people whose lives she affected as if what Helen did was some minor offense."
3,So close and yet so far...,"This little book is an original story which unfortunately misses the boat on some important areas. The heroine, Elfwyn, has a nice Anglo-Saxon name, which would be fine if she were not an Icelander. The overall thrust of the tale is an explanation of the aurora borealis, which actually may not have been visible during the viking Age in Iceland. It's a great little story, and I whole-heartedly endorse it as such, just not as a good reflection of early Viking iceland and its beliefs."
4,The Anxiety & Phobia Workbook,"Great book to help someone work out his/her less severe ""issues""... a nice supplement to a few sessions with a qualified therapist."
2,Dismayed,"The book is probably great to those that know nothing about any psychological concepts. But most of the information is already out there on the internet or in other psychological books. This is definately not for people who already have done prior research. Many of the ideas like finding your ""inner child"" seem somewhat implausible to me."
4,Must have book to begin work on anxiety,"Good explanation of the forms of anxiety, useful techniques to work on and links to other books to go deep on the diferents topics.It is my central workbook to overcome my social anxiety.I don't know why this book is not traduced in my language iet (french).Some concepts are missing, but can be retreved in books referenced in it. A very good starting point to work on your anxiety owhever."
5,Norman Mailer on Luke Breit's poetry,"""Luke is a rainmaker. Put him in a desert, get him to recite, and clouds will gather...If I could be a poet, I wouldn't mind at all being as good as Luke Breit."""
5,Like Being There,If you ever wondered what it would be like to trace the steps of Mark Twain or Huckleberry Finn this is your chance. This author uses words to paint a picture that is as clear as a if you were there in person. I enjoyed every page.
4,Nice way to start,"I learned a little from the video, It's OK for the price. There are some other vidos I connected better with but the main factor is to practice. For my particular style some people teach a bit better than on this video, but for a beginner you will learn some basics."
5,Great idea!,"This power strip is a great idea! I purchased it as a gift for my father. It's a nice energy saver, and it's great to be able to push one button (in his case, the computer) and have everything turn on. It works just like I would have expected, and he uses all the time. I may purchase another for me!"
4,Smart Strip Power Strip,"Works great. I had been crawling under my computer table to turn off the power strip at night. Now it does it by itself. I only wish that ALL of the ""power saving"" outlets were spaced further apart. I have one transformer that won't fit. But the power strip is doing it's job. I like it."
3,"A GOOD STORY, BUT VERY LITTLE DR. WHO","The Storyline of this novel is very compelling. Dr. Who lands in Arkhaven, a city which must evacuate its inhabitants because the moon orbiting around them is breaking up and will crash into their planet. Although, I really like the storyline, very little of the action involves Dr. Who. He is a minor character with very few scenes particularly in the first half of the book. This is my first Dr. Who book and I hope other novels feature Dr. Who, not others whom I don't particularly care about."
3,"basic, basic, book","Decision in Philadelphia is a basic account of the Constitutional Convention, nothing more. I didn't enjoy this as much as Catherine Bowen's, ""Miracle at Philadelphia"" as it seemed so ""amateurish"". It was a decent account of the events and the arguments but at times it seemed to bounce all over the place. It didn't have any of the well written style found in real historians' writings such as David McCullough, in fact it was mediocre at best. Their analysis to today's events is well balanced but they seem hung up on race relations with half assed conclusions. These guys should stick to writing children's books. I enjoyed their ""My Brother Sam is Dead"" series when I read it in fifth grade. Read Bowen's ""Miracle..."" or James D. Best's ""Tempest at Dawn"" for a good read about this momentus time in history."
4,A Good Buy~This Girl Can Play,"I have most of Joyce Cooling's CD's And they are all pleasing to listen to. I do agree with many reviewer's that some of her CD's tracks could use abit more creativity,but by the same token other tracks on her CD's are outstanding. And this CD also fits into that catagory. If your a fan of hers, this is a good CD for your collection. Before Dawn & China Basin are my favorites with Callie pulling in at third.I recently saw her perform at Sioux Falls, S.D. Jazz & Blues Festival! What a great show, her performance is full of energy and be prepared to be entertained. She is also most gracious with the audience and at the autograph table, shaking hands and talking with people. She gets 5***** for being a total professional & lady!!! Hope to see her in S.D. again!"
4,Very good file,"I am rather impressed with the sharpness of this file. It cuts very well on hard stainless steel, and leaves no heavy scratches. The narrow side is not quite as narrow as I needed, however. Don't count on being able to sharpen to the very bottom of triangular teeth on a fine-tooth hand saw; it is still about 1/16th inch thick at the narrowest side.Really, I should have purchased a feather file for what I was attempting. Nonetheless, this is a well made file, albeit somewhat pricey."
2,The overblown history of the Celts.,"This book was a disappointment. As an Irish American, I wanted to learn a little of my ancestors. What I got was a book that made some wild assumptions. When the author stated that the Taureg nomadic people of North Africa may be related to the Celts, I nearly fell off my rocker. The Taureg are the deepest black and to try to relate them to the Celts, well that was quite interesting. In this book, the author aims some sharp jabs at the Romans, British, and the English royal family including Prince Charles. I think those comments also may have been uncalled for.I learned a little about the Celts, but I think I may have to read The Celts by Nora Chadwick to get an objective view of the Celts. For those who want a more objective view of the Celts, read elsewhere."
2,Surprisingly Disappointed...,"The screen is very nice and affordable; however, either exact dimensions weren't given, or I missed them. Because, if I had known how short it is, I would have never ordered (probably why it's so cheap)."
3,Okay,"It was working fine when one fine day it suddenly stopped working.. may be my mistake that I did not do ""remove safely""... that I used to do earlier too..It is not working now..Recommendation to others who buy this.. do ""remove safely"" before disconnecting..Otherwise this product is good.."
1,Great BUT ..,"2.5 enclosures are great at general , they often need only USB , are smaller & quiter the 3.5 and way cooler .So there is no reason why this drive should be any other and I'm sure its a great product .However this enclosure while pretty seems to have no activity leds nor a 3-5 years warrenty !You can buy a 100GB HD and a stylish enclosure ( with leds ) yourself and get the same product for about the same $$$ . ALL 2.5 HDs provide 3 years warrenty and Seagate gives 5 years on the latest momentus line , so why only 1 year warrenty here ?"
2,"Probably Right for Someone, Just Not for Me","I haven't worn the darn thing yet. I was looking for a really simple, single layer bralette that's loose enough to not pull down on my shoulders, but this has a puckery shape that I don't care for. The cotton is soft. Will probably work under a heavy sweater."
5,No Sanity in Sanctity,"Stereo Sanctity kept me glued page after page; a whirlwind of suspense, perversion and horror plagued my mind. Not only does Mike E. Purfield have the gift of a great storyteller, he describes his characters in a way where I felt myself growing close to them, as if I had just met them at the B.G.C.B to catch a show. And his knowledge of music gives the book a fresh feel. Recognizing many of the bands he mentions, I could easily relate to the lifestyle of the characters in this tale.I'm definitely proud to add Stereo Sanctity to my collection.Just when you think the genre is slipping, along comes Mike E. Purfield, spooks blazing and ready to open a new porthole to the world or Horror."
1,Does not look like new,"It came covered in dust and dirt. Moreover, it looked like it was laying on a shelf for ages. The item does not look new. Do not recommend!"
1,one of the worst books ever written,"I had to read this book for my honors Theatre class, and let me tell you it is the most boring book ever! Sure, the author had some good points, but he didn't need to drone on and on about them forever! Nearly no one in my class liked the book. We especially didn't enjoy his comment ""Go beat your wife and kids"". there are far better books out there. Do Not read this book! The only other books as bad as this one are ""The Scarlet Letter"" and ""Walden"""
5,A MUST HAVE BOOK!!,Awesome book!! Book is filled with helpful information to help you nail an audition! Captures ur attention from the beginning. Would recommend this book to all who need some audition help!!
1,Money Back Guarantee? Only if you call your CC Company,"Being a storm spotter, I purchased this subscription software to warn me of approaching storms or potential threats. The software boasts of viewing 6 weather sites at once. It also says in the description ""Severe weather alerts"". Well, you will get Severe Weather Alerts for ONLY ONE site... not all six.Only 90 minutes after installing and paying for the subscription, I uninstalled the software and then contactedWeatherbug support (via email only) telling them I wish to receive a refund. My email was answered by an automated email, with a 'Case Number'. I waited 29 days for a response. On the 29th day, I contacted my Credit Card company and disputed the charge. That was how I received my refund. If the company had honored thier 30 Day Money Back Guarantee Policy, AND the software description was not misleading, I probably would have had a 5-star experience."
5,Weatherbug Plus,"I love all the features of Weatherbug Plus, especially the my locations and skins. However I do think it's a tad bulky.Otherwise I have been totally satisfied for three years!"
5,Reform School GTA,This is an exceptionally fun and well made game that contains a great deal of style and humor. I think most GTAers will have a good time with this.
5,Bully PS2,This was bought as a gift for my brother. He is very happy with the game. He highly recommends it. The price was fair (but it was on sale at the time) and it arrived quickly.
4,"Just like, but not realy","I never went to private school, thank god, so I dont know what its like. If Bully is anything like it im kinda sad I didnt go. It has every aspect of being a kid (slingshots, wedges, kiss and dont tell). The graphics are good for a Rockstar Grand Theft Auto-like game.Could have made the mini games a little more in depth. Also could have made the area a little bigger, but then you would have to come up with a better means of travel.Overall Bully is a very note worthy production by Rockstar. I cant wait to beat it."
2,Poor graphics,"I bought this book in Kindle version and I read it on iPad mini. I must say the ""pictures"" are very poorly rendered, even for a ""low-resolution"" screen of iPad mini."
3,"Relevant Reference, dictionary material!","The index was what I found most useful about this book. What it entails are good information; however, it is time comsuming to read eveyrthing through.If someone is looking for some advice on a particular topic (eg. Workplace communications, professional attitude, etc) then he/she will find this book useful and worthwhile. It is a great resource, if you know what you are looking for."
1,This product did not help my period pain at all,I tried it for my last two periods and it had no effect on me. I still had all the discomfort and pain.
3,Long wait,"I received the pills a month and a half after purchase. I wasn't pleased because.. well.. If I buy something now.. It's not because I want it a month and a half later. I made my feedback neutral because the product did in fact arrive, and when I contacted customer support, even as unhappy as I was, they DID e-mail me back, and did eventually send the pills. If it were said on the purchase page that pills were not in stock and on back order, I would give them a 5 star review. Better luck next time, I would still buy from here."
5,Great Soundtrack CD!,"I bought this CD, after seeing the movie, mainly for the Jordan Cahill songs. The rest of the CD is good too - a great mix of songs!"
5,stocking up lll,"Great book for canning for the beginner, and good recipies for what to do with the food once you get it canned."
4,--------------------------------,"most of the songs are very good, couple are fillers, but would recommend this to anyone loving the 80's/90's rock."
3,I must be too far away,"This is a nice looking antenna and it should be for the price, but I'd take ugly rabbit ears for great reception. I read reviews that this got great reception for people who were within 15 miles of the towers. I live in a suburban/city area with towers 18-20 miles away and figured I'd get alright reception. Unfortunately, no matter what I did, even putting this thing outside, I didn't get much reception at all. The best channel I got was less than 15 miles away, so it should have looked great, but it was very grainy. I couldn't give this a good rating of course, but I do think this will work for certain people in the right environment."
3,Thorough but Dryyyyyyy......,"This reads like the driest of text books but what it lacks in compelling storytelling, it makes up for with extensive research and thorough accounting. Only recommended for those with a penchant for adding to their Pearl Harbor libraries."
2,Not What I Wanted,"I am rating this low because it's not what I wanted at all. I have to say that someone else may just love it though. The contents are taken directly from Chase's Calendar of Events, & is like a condensed version. Since I had also purchased Chase's Calendar of Events, I have no need whatsoever for this book."
1,What was this?,"What was this movie? Meyer Lansky did a lot of good for this country. He was a wonderful, Jewish gangster. There should be more people like this mensch. This director and Richard Dreyfuss, dare to tell the story of a great man such as Meyer Lansky? Oh Please!!!!!!!"
5,I thought the movie and book were close.,"I read the book and could see a lot of the book in the movie. I am a history buff and thought the movie some historical fasts, like the building of Vagas."
3,corelle coordinates callaway 4 piece bake and serve casserole set,Aren't you tired of me whining about this stuff being made in China? Yeah? You could shut me up if you moved operations back to New York. The item works fine. I would enjoy it more if it were made by my brother Americans.
1,Most boring video ever.,Bethany Lyons' incessant talking was too much for me. This DVD is going straight in to the garbage. It is nothing at all like the Yoga Sculpt actually taught at Crunch gym. It is slow and boring.
1,Unsatisfied customer,This product broke after only 2 times after me using it. It seemed very cheap and generic. I was extremely unsatisfied with this product
5,Great Product,"For the price it works great. It is a little cheaply constructed, but it does what I need it to do.. charge! If you are looking for something to work that is cheap, pick this product."
3,Occuring error occasionally,"Worked great when I first got it. Now, 6 months later I occasionally get charger not supported by this device error. First time happened, to me on a cross country trip, of course when I needed my charger the most! After retrying about 40 times it worked and I only get the error occasionally now."
1,"Good price, but waste of money","I'm happy to say that I was exited when I got this kitsince my other charger broke. Unfortunetly they broke the second time I tried to use it. I am lucky that I was able to get a refund since I did spend my money on it. But I was looking forward to having it. Also, the actual time it took to get here was longer than the time they told me. That also irritated me."
1,Piece of Junk,This item looks like it does it the ad but that is about it. The car charger & the house charger as well as the cable don't work. A relative of mine also purchased 1 and had the same results. So my opinion is this was a ripoff.
2,USB Travel Kit for Apple iPod,"So far this kit brings 3 different chargers. The one for car (one of the most important for me) is not working, when I use it for the first time; in the iPod appear a message that said that the charger is not compatible with the equipment. Of course for the price I paid I cannot complain much, but I would of course not go to recommend it."
4,Not apple but good,"This is not an Apple product, but serves the purpose. Very convenient for charging my ipod and dont have to hook it to the computer/laptop to charge it. Haven't yet used the car charger. Price is good plus it was delivered before the scheduled delivery date."
3,Not Working Right Out Of The Box...,"The car charger worked great. I could charge my iPod while listening to it. I'm currently trying to use the Travel Adaptor, but so far it's not working. I'm trying to discover the problem. It's not the cord, because the cord is working when connecting the iPod to computer. So, I can't really say anything about how the travel adapter works. But I give the car charger 5 stars. It gets the job done.edit :: i actually got it to work. it works great. you just have to wait a second for your iPod to display the charging symbol."
3,Only so so in charging...,"Got this as a package deal with some screen and case covers. The plug in wall socket charger seems to do a decent job charging up the phone. The cigarette plug seems to only send enough juice to maintain my iPhone4S' ability to stay on. Tried using it when I had my mapping program (Waze) on for a long trip once and thought I could use the cigarette plug to recharge it, but didn't seem to work as well.Also, the included USB cable precludes me from using my iFrogz Treadz case as the 30pin plug on the bottom of the phone case opening will take an Apple OEM cable, but since the included USB jack is a bit wider, I need to slip my phone out it's case in order to use it. I've since relegated the USB cable that came with this kit for use with my kids iTouches which have a larger opening."
1,USB Travel Kit for Apple iPod,"Ordered 3 of these for Christmas gifts for my grandsons on December 7th and as of today, March 18th, still have not received"
4,iPod USB Travel KIt,"The kit is great, except that the house plug shorted out after a couple of uses, but that appears to be from a faulty outlet and not from plug design. I use the car charger and cable continually."
2,Still Waiting,"Who would know how I like it, still have not recieved items! Still hoping to get it before the end of the year, ordered on black friday"
2,not the best quality,"the connector leads on the adaptors fail to make proper contact after some use and the product essentially becomes unreliable or useless. you get what you pay for. in this case, that was the case for me."
1,Misrepresented,"This product does not live up to it's advertisment. One it's made of cheap plastic and the cord is not 6 feet. It comes with a very short cable that retracts on a spindle. This product took a month to get to me and then when it did, it was not even of good quality. The thing came from Hong Kong so it was on a really slow boat to the US. I would not recommend anyone buying this product unless they just don't have a choice."
1,Wall adapter doesn't work,"I kept an open mind and gave them the benefit of the doubt. When I received the items, I plugged in the wall adapter with my iPad USB cable, and all I got was a ""not connected"" status where the charging message should appear. I tried their USB cable with their wall adapter, and that didn't work, either. I tried their USB cable with an OEM wall adapter and it worked. Basically, their wall adapter is garbage. I should have trusted the reviews."
2,inexpensive but cheap too,"I bought these because they were inexpensive. Unfortunately, they're also very cheap. The car adapters burnt out in the first use. The wall adapters do just fine, but they have a very loose USB connection, which is really annoying, especially if they get bumped while charging the phone. The USB cord loses connection easily."
1,M.I.A.,"Funny thing is...It, 3 to b exact, were paid for. Now I'm being asked for a review... I NEVER RECIEVED THE G.D.THING!!! very UNSATISFIED!! WTF?!?! SO.. THANX... 5 kids, 3 ipods, 18 hour trip n the car, and 1, yes ONE usb charger to share, that kept effin up my g.d. radio! Ugh!!"
3,so far so good,"i wait for 2 weeks to get it, i try the wall plug, it works and there is a small red light when plug in. But it makes my ipod touch heat when plug in with electricity. Ipod touch apprears ""ipod touch is over hest now, please use later"". Actually i didn't use it when it plug in.I didn't use the car plug until now. I hope it can work."
4,Such a Deal !,"May not be OEM But,Great deal for the money$ & Very fast shipment.Do business again anytime."
5,Buy It!!!,"I was kind of wary of this product because it is so inexpensive, but I like it way better than Apple's iPhone charger. Especially the way it rolls itself up (so you don't have a long cord all over the floor). I haven't had any problems with this product and recommend others to purchase it as well."
1,Cheap quality,"This thing looked and felt so cheap, I didn't even want to try it for fear of ruining something. So I bought a real one from apple."
1,charger kit,This charger is junk. We blew two I pods do to a bad charger. I would not recommend this product do to problems.
1,USB Charger review,"Useless, did not work even once. Do not buy. Not worth buying this product, waste of time and money. Cheap, knot worth the trouble, I paid shipping fee as well."
3,For the money I guess,The car charger never worked. Plugged it in for the first time and it did nothing. Smelled a little and that was it. The other regular plug charger was cool. The only thing about that was that the cord wasn't as long as I thought. But for the money......now I have to buy another car charger tho. More shipping.
3,Good items but not well built,"These are good items to have, however the items are not well built. One of the pins in the wall charger was loose when the items reached me..."
2,"worked great for eight months, than stopped working","All the pieces worked great for eight months, then the DC adapter stopped working. It took me a few days to realize what the problem was because my phone just wouldn't turn on. Glad I didn't go to a store and complain about the phone when it was the charging mechanism that was broken."
1,Not what it seems,"Does not charge the iPhone 4 as it says it does. Once connected, the screen says that the accessory won't work."
2,mediocre at best,"We ordered this charger for our Ipod Touch/Iphone because we wanted an easy way to charge without plugging into the computer. My wife and I are disappointed with this devices inability to charge our products with consistency and speed. Sometimes is works, but not as well as plugging into a USB port, and sometimes it doesn't charge at all. (says charging on the unit, but doesn't ever raise battery power) We are sorry we wasted the money."
2,Charges SLOOOOWLY !! Will not help if you need phone charged.,"Car charger does not charge much at all ! Light comes on indicating on phone that it's charging but its a trickle charge at best. I had it plugged in on vacation and had to use the phone for maps quit frequently and charger didn't even keep phone at a steady percentage. I tried one day plugging in on my way to work and phone charge went up a whole 1% in about 35 minutes. Even though it is a good price, it's not worth it because I still need a CHARGER !"
1,Terrible- ripoff,"Product doesn't work. Will not charge my iPod. Plugs into iPod fine, but just doesn't work. This is a scam and ripoff in my opinion. Don't buy!!"
2,The product was ok,"The car charger is great I would recommend this product. The I pod cord worked great.The travel adapter was good,but the packaging was really bad and it was cracked when I got it."
3,USB kit,For the price it was worth buying it. I bought it to work with my iPhone but it didn't work. It works on my iPod though.
2,"This is for the iPod, Not the iPhone. I Don't Know How to Read","This will not work for the iPhone. For the iPod, I am not sure. Don't be like me, hoping it will work for an iPhone. If you do, you'll run out of battery, get a flat tire and be pulled off in some ditch on a dark rainy night. Murphy's Law people."
3,Eh...,"Only buy this for the car and wall charger. The connector sucks, as it is very thin so it will come apart after a months use. But, you get what you pay for."
3,Won't Work with Otter Box,"Seems to work fine. However, it will not work with an Otter Box phone case. I have to remove the case from the phone for it to fit. I would not have purchased had I known this ahead of time. However, it was inexpensive and I can still use it as a less convenient back up charger."
3,Get What You Pay For,"Pro: You can't beat the price.Con: Unreliable performance. The USB cable itself seems to work fine, I've never had a problem connecting directly to a computer. The AC adapter and car charger both suffer from fits of non-performance. Generally, the phone acknowledges being charged, but the charging rate is greatly reduced, sometimes to the point where it merely balances the power consumed by the phone being on.Better than nothing, but know what you're getting."
1,"Yes, it's only $.01, but it's not worth it.","I can't believe that I am complaining about an item that only costs $.01. I bought the item to have the necessary items to charge my ipod touch from my nightstand instead of my computer. The retractable cord that came with the order didn't fit with the case I have, but that wasn't the worst of it. The outlet would not stay properly plugged in to charge the ipod touch. I even tried putting a rubber band around the plug and my power strip and that wouldn't hold it on because of the design. So basically, the item isn't worth the $2.97 is paid to ship it to me. If you are just looking for a retractable cord, and you have a small thin case, it might be okay for you, but skip it if you are going for the outlet usb charger."
1,Car Charger Did Not Work,The car charger did not work. Useless. Not worth returning it all the way to Hong Kong. Ended up in the trash.
1,"USB Travel Kit with Car Charger, Travel Adapter & Cable for Apple iPod From Lucky Electronics (Ships From Hong Kong)","DO NOT USE THIS OR BUY THIS PRODUCT , IT SHORTED OUT , STARTED SMOKING AND BURNED OUT MY IPOD .IS CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP , ONLY USE THE RIGHT APPLE PRODUCTS.DO NOT BUY CHEAP COPIES LIKE THIS.THEY WILL NOT GIVE YOU YOUR MONEY BACK AND YOU WILL BE LEFT WITH A USELESS BURNED UP IPOD OR IPAD !!! .. I THREW IT STRAIGHT INTO THE GARBAGE CAN ALONG WITH MY NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY IPOD !! BE CAREFUL IF ITS CHEAP , THEN ITS CHEAP !!!! BETTER OFF BUYING THE RIGHT ONES FROM APPLE !!!"
2,Wall charger did not work,"I can't recommend this travel kit with wall charger. The charger did not work at all when I plugged my iPod into it. I liked the retractable cord, but fat lot of good it does, it the thing doesn't work."
1,Cheap chinese junk.,"Broke right out of the box, and the male connect that goes into the ipod moves around and destroyes the ipod jack."
1,Do not buy this one,"It can never be used for my ipad 2. When I used it, my pad can't be charged so it is useless. If you want to loss money, please buy it!"
3,Meh..its ok,Cheap quality but expected since I only paid 3.99 for it. The charger did not fit my phone unless I took it out of the case (I have a Speck case)
5,works,works great. Is exactly what I wanted. Good for the price too. I used to have one of these cords though and it eventually kinda tore. So Im hoping the same thing doesn't happen to this one. Just gotta be careful with it.
4,Cable,This item seems to work very well for what it was bought for. It charges well. It shipped very quickly and was packaged very well.
1,I don't like this item from BlueProton.,"I don't like BlueProton because they sent me a defective item and I have to pay the return shipping fee.I like Amazon because they refund me whole the payment, otherwise BlueProton would not refund me the shipping fee which is more expensive than the price of item."
1,MISSING TRAVEL KIT,"I cannot review this item since I have not received it so far at the shipping address I gave Amazon when I did the purchase.I bought four items, and I only got two of them by mail.What happened to the other two items?-Apple iPod USB Travel Kit with Car Charger, Travel Adapter & Cable (Purchased on 09/15/2006)-KOSS Stereo In Ear Ear Plugs - The Spark Plug (Purchased on 09/15/2006)WHO KNOWS..."
1,No good either,I am sure it would of been great But I never got this item. I bought this item some screen protectors & 14 differennt color cases for my daughters ipod touch. All at the same time. The only thing I got was the cases. I was very disapointed that this item never came. I had to buy it from a local store and pay top dollar so I could get it in time for my daughter's birthday.
1,it took to long,The charger took a whole month to get here. I thought it got lost in the mail so i bought a new one that cost 35.00.What a waste. Never buying from company again.
3,doesn't fit in Iphone with lifeproof case,doesn't fit in Iphone with lifeproof case. The head needs to be the same size as the one thst comes from Apple
1,Still haven't received our order!!,"Ordered car accessories for our Iphones back in the begining of January, we still haven't received them. Good thing they come with chargers!"
3,IPod Travel Adapter,"This is a good price for a AC and Car adapter for an IPod, the only problem is that the cable supplied does not work with my IPod, I own the 80 GB Classic and the cable supplied does not work my IPod. It does work with IPod Nano, so I was able to swap cables with a friend who had a similar AC adapter and owned the Nano. So be forewarned if you own the 80 GB classic and you purchase this adapter you will need to either get a new connecting cable or use the one that came with your IPod."
3,It's okay,"The stretchy cord for the ipod, broke quickly but the adapters, have lasted me two years so far and they continue to work everyday."
3,You get what you pay for,"After a few months if use the cord tore up at both ends, a piece fell off if the car charger and it slides out of the power source slowly. The indoor charger works well though"
2,usb,"The second time I use the charger it wouldnt work , I had to keep playing with the cord to make it work"
5,plug it in,I bought this for the iPod we take it everywhere with us so we can just plug it in to charge
2,does not charge ipad 2,this charger was a great price and although it states it charges ipad 2 it does not i plugged it in and the ipad says not charging and it did not charged i left it in and it charged only 80% when i woke up the next morning
1,You get what you paid for.,"I'm not quite sure how this is getting such good reviews, but I bought this and within a couple months the wall charger started to work off and on. Then it just died. The car charger never worked, from the beginning, no matter what I did. The cable is a joke in its quality and never even fit with my iPod, even though it should have. In the end, this set is made of cheap plastic, cheap components and not even worth the couple dollars you're going to waste on it. Just don't do it."
3,ipod charger,"When the original product broke on the first use, the seller was very prompt in sending another."
1,Warning: prong may pull off in wall AC outlet,"We have an AC USB charger with the same case for the transformer as this model, except in black. After a little more than a year of use one of the metal prongs pulled off in a wall AC outlet. This is a major safety issue. If you get one of these, be very careful with it."
4,Good for price.,"This item is pretty solid for such a low price. Shipping took about 4 weeks, but the item itself seems to work good. I haven't used it more than 3 weeks yet, but it's held up this far. If you're looking for an extra charger and can wait for the shipping, this kit is pretty great."
2,Charger,I was not satisfied with the charger at all. It tore up after about 2 days of use. Poor quality all the way around. I don't recommend this product.
1,Piece o' Pooh,"Plugged in after a couple of uses and ""kaboom!"" sparks flying! Just happy I did not lose my I-Pod over this""piece o' pooh!"""
2,Finally,I ordered this item (two travel chargers) the week after Christmas for my son who received an iPod for. Christmas. I received the package on April 2. The price was right and the product okay as long as you are in no hurry to receive.
1,Massage Chair with bad track record,I have had my Comfort trends massage chair for just over a year it has been back to the factory once because it stopped working(that was after one month) .Now it is broken again and the customer service number has been dissconnected. Do not buy from this company!!!!!!!
5,Good Blades!,These blades fit my Craftsman scroll saw well and work better than the blades that came with the saw. Will order these again!
1,"Predictable, disappointing","From other glowing reviews, was hoping for a novel with the wit, wisdom, and style of an Austen novel. Very disappointed. Predictable ending after the first several pages. No suspense, painfully obvious plot, much of the wording and actions seem out of place for the period. Lacks the clever and astute observations and dry humor I was expecting from a novel compared favorably to Austen. Only the setting and subject (marriage/young aristocratic English ladies) were similar. Superficial character development. At least it was short. Otherwise I would have given up after the the sentence describing a pleasant afternoon pleasantly engaged in ... blah blah blah. I spent a tedious evening tediously skimming this tedious tome."
4,"A bit sillly, but fun nevertheless.","This is a short, fun read, nothing deep and nothing particularly complex but it was sure fun to read. Parts are absolutely hilarious, and the author's prose is lovely and crisp. The only real problem I had was that the feelings (even the funny parts) are very modern, and certainly do not bring to mind Jane Austen as some reviewers have mentioned. But like I said, this is short and sweet and you can very certainly do much worse. I will be interested to see how this author develops because I think she has potential."
4,Lighthearted read,"If you're looking for serious, super-high-quality fiction, keep looking, but if you want a reasonably well-written, lighthearted story that will have you laughing out loud and often, this is it. There is suspense and romance along the way, too. I enjoyed it all the way through. I could definitely see this book made into a movie."
3,Disappointing,I should have read the reviews of the indiviual cd's before purchasing this. It is basically some very good Broadway musicals badly presented by 1950ish Hollywood. Read the individual movie reviews and see if this is a set you want to own. Oh well the price is good but I expected better movies.
4,Old Gold...,While all the musicals in this collection are well worth the price my favorites are The Band Wagon and the incomparable Bells Are Ringing. Have Fun!
2,About his singing,"He really needs to pay attention to nailing his vocals. Honestly, its hard to listen to a vocal that missing most of the passing notes. Sorry but the vocals are more important than that."
2,The music is dreadfull,"I am a fan of Jennifer and I like very much all her videos, the ten minute solution with the band and the one without, and the dance off the inches hip hop party. Unfortunately I didn't like the crunch videos and I really prefer the others. I see my level as an intermediate and a bit of a dancer and this wasn't fun to me because I hated the music it seamed that I was in an arena bullfighting instead of being dancing and this videos have also to many people in the background you get distracted when the camera changes from one person to another. I did it all once and by the end of the video I was lost because I was tired to think about the moves and in this one you really need to pay attention. I tried to do it two other times but the music really didn't got me going."
1,Received Damaged With No Response to Replace.,"Compact disk (CD) was delivered damaged ""center ring cracked"" not playable. CD was old and possibly sun damaged. Made contact with seller and replied once with no additional emails or no resolve to damaged CD."
5,This isn't normal...,"For all of you Harry Connick Jr. Fans, and I imagine some of you are very intimate with sinatra and the like, This Isn't Normal.For all of you B. Marsalis Fans out there, and I imagine your very intimate with the weird modern jazz bebop, This Isn't Normal Either.Marsalis and Connick have collaborated for this Dvd, an awesome duo occasion...and strange, that's also what they named it.This is a spur of the moment performance to occompany a spur of the moment cd release. bravo..."
3,gibson,"installed on 04 ram hemi 1y ago. fit installation was good, but one hanger was broken. louder than thought, bad drone noise 1500-2000rpm."
2,Chock full of inaccurate information.,This was a frustrating book to read. Poorly researched and poorly written. See if your library has it before you spend the $20.
1,OLD EXAM DOSS/CORE !!!!!,another attempt to sell junk to customers wishing to become A+ certified PERHAPS AMAZON SHOULD EXAMINE THESE BOOKS BEFORE THEY ADVERTIZE THEM??????????
4,Excellent TV series finally being released individually...,"This is an excellent sci-fi tv series from 1995 which gets even better with season two. The series is reminiscent of ""The Twilight Zone"". A variety of guest actors appear in the various episodes from Leonard Nimoy to Alyssa Milano. Originally only the first season was released in 2005 on DVD, with theme sets completing the collection, so it's great that it appears that each of the seven seasons will now be released individually and at a nice price. At the time of this writing a new season was to come out about every month starting in May, 2010, with season five scheduled to come out in August, 2010. So far Alliance Atlantis is only releasing the new season sets in Canada. Season 3 was released on June 1, 2010."
4,Almost complete,Having Crimean Tatar ancestry I was very excited by reading this book. It focuses on the history after the illegal annexation of Crimea by Russia. I wish they paid more attention on the Crimean Khanate history but this could be the topic of another book.
5,Works Amazing,I tried the tunecast mobile transmitter and i always got static. This works perfect and it sounds like the iPod is pkugged straight into the stereo. Highly recomended
4,Fine for the price,I have had this item for an year+ now. It has worked well untill a last few months. Now it gives a static on any freq. I might buy a new one again. Seems a fine buy for the price....but does not last long .. life span seems to be about an year before you start hearing the snake sizzing.
4,Good product,"This product works well. I live in the Chicago area where radio stations abound and I was able to make it work immediately. The sound is not going to be perfect has if your ipod was hardwired into your car's sound system, but it's sufficient. I'm pleased."
1,no connections,Had horrible luck with this product. Was not stable and connected poorly! Thought it was my car and gave it to another person to try and it did not work for theirs either!
4,ROAD Trip,Couldn't be happier with this product. My only complaint is the unit is a little heavy which attributes to a loose connection after time. Although that's a minor issue to me.
1,Not worth it!,"FM transmitters are expensive and the only plus to this that it is cheap! Their is just too much stuff that you have to use!! it shouldn't be this difficult to play music! It is not car friendly! For my Chevy, I had to use the extension that it came with but this was too much weight with my ipod stressing out my cigarette lighter in my car. No matter if i put the extension on it or not, it causing troubles with my driving. It got in the way of my steering wheel. When I had it actually playing, sound was actually sounded pretty clear but then it started to freeze my ipod. NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!"
4,Good Buy,"I read the reviews before I bought this product. Even though they were mostly negative, complaining about how flimsy it is or that it doesn't charge the ipod while in use, and I have experienced none of these problems. It works great and I use it on a daily basis."
3,It's so-so,"This thing must depend highly on your vehicle and the existing stations in your locale. I had to flip through several bandwidths on several occasions to get any sound on the radio. It seems like stations that work one day do not work on another day. I do have this the Roadtrip positioned right in front of my radio BTW('02 Pathfinder) I tried it in a different car and could't get it to work at all in that one as well. So, basically, it works but with frequent fiddling. Also, when you dock and undock your iPod, it's almost like resetting the Roadtrip so you have to start over in some cases. We also have a $19 iPod adapter (forget the brand)and it performs better than this one, we got this one because of the extender kit which does work well and seems relatively solid."
5,Easy to use and sturdy,"I bought the RoadTrip along with my Video iPod and I couldn't be happier. The arm can be adapted to fit around almost anything that could get in the way (cup holders, gear shift, etc), and it looks great too. The arm is extremely sturdy and it doesn't wobble when driving.Tuning is easy, and even driving cross-country I've never had a problem finding an empty channel to use (although it may require resetting near urban areas). Excellent product."
3,This is an ok product,For the price it is an acceptable product. Curiously it works best when its raining -- I get clearer reception.
3,COOL....EASY INSTALL.. OKAY SOUND,"This item is great, comes with many different pieces to help with any trouble you may have with the device in terms of holding the ipod in place. not sure y but maybe my cars to blame but theres times where the item will pop out of place and i will have to reinsert it...also, it really varies at how well the item will play all depending upon the area you are in...The sounds are a bit annoying but tolerable. overall, im happy with it, i needed something at a good price!"
2,not what it's cracked up to be,"It plays my music. That's about the best thing i can say for it. It doesn't charge the newer Nano. It has limited volume. And when turning the car off it will start the Ipod if it was already off, so you have to turn the Ipod off again. For $5 or $10 that i paid you could say, what did you expect. But i would rather have paid $20 and got something that works the way it should."
3,Very Basic,"It meets the basic need of being able to play my iPod in the car.Overall sound quaility is very good.My car's design (Saturn) requires me use most of the extensios that come with the product.Unfortunately, it does not support the newer iPods, or the iTouch.Though it plays my Nano, it does not have a fitted holder for it."
1,A Huge Disappointment,"Seriously, even at $15, it's not worth it. This is just junk.I tested it in three different cars and with my home stereo, and across the spectrum of the FM band. Signal strength is not a problem, but the quality of the sound is pitiful. FM radios used to have a mono selection for when the stereo signal was weak, and that got rid of a lot of the noise at the cost of losing the stereo. This sound quality is like bad FM stereo."
3,"Good product, but...","I really like this product. It is thoughtfully designed and easy to use? Why the three stars? There aren't enough clear radio stations in my area to use regularly. Even a little sound from a station kills it.So, I love the product, it's application that is a question. Check your radio dial in the areas you normally drive before forking over another $50 bucks for iPod stuff. If you don't have lots of static, rethink it."
2,Works but difficult to use,I love that this product works great through the radio and charges the ipod at the same time. The thing that's most difficult is that my outlet is in an place that makes the itrip really inconvienent to use. It's extremely bulky and doesn't fit right. I actually had to give mine away.
5,Fantastic at this price,I bought this to use while on a long trip. It was a bit difficult to get it set up (mainly due to where the cigarette lighter resides in a rented chevy impala) but it worked perfectly. Of course it doesn't sound as good as an expensive speaker system but at this price it does the job perfectly well. Even if you only use it once it's worth buying.
4,Young At Heart,"I'm not a teenager, but I enjoyed Belle and the Beau. Ms Jenkins is one of my favorite authors and she never disappoints you whether she's writing for the young or the mature. The AA historical information she includes in her writing is enlightening and a history lesson as well. She can not write fast enough for me, but a good author takes their time and does not try to make quotas, yet I can not wait for her next book."
2,Case of Poor Quality,"I had this timer just two days and the magnet/stand broke off. While the timer features are good, the quality of the plastic case is poor. The numbers and letters on the keys could be larger, too."
3,"Does the trick, but","I like that you can time 3 different things at once. But - the sound! I hate the beep. It's a bit harsh, tin-y. When it beeps I can't turn it off fast enough. Other than that....."
4,Great Timer,The timer is an advancement on their previous models which we have three ~ was absolutely incredible. This one is easier and takes AAA versus AA. It also allows you to have the time running which is very helpful.
1,Avoid TurboTax,"TurboTax, one of the best products that made doing your taxes at least managable, has shot itself in the foot this time. They require you to ""activate"" their program, which doesn't always activate it. You can't change any computer components or it will stop working (I upgraded a HD). It will only work from 1 computer (make sure you choose the one you want to use the first time!) It installs software that always runs in the background, even when you are not using Turbotax (is is sending my personal data out somewhere, is this a huge security hole?).The only thing going for them is the 60 day refund. Of course even then you have to pay shipping."
1,Distrusted,"TurboTax showed a lack of trust in its users, many of whom abused the agreement, by not informing buyers about the changes to the software for purposes of enforcing their one copy rule. I don't mind that they are trying to protect their investment. That is good business. Their lack of trust in me by not informing us before we purchased the software is not good business policy. Changes to established products should be disclosed. I will not be buying TurboTax next year."
5,Great cookbook,After buying Kitchaid attachments and starting to make fresh homemade pasta we needed to come up with some new pasta ideas. This book is full of good ideas. We have used multiple recipes from this book.
1,junk product,"I got the product and it installed easy enough, but it lasted thru april 18 then it quit working. it had the inputs needed but no output. don't buy it"
1,White Board Peels Off Easily,"After students used white boards for two days, the white boards started separating on the edges and corners. I recomend not to buy this kind of white boards since quality does not match price."
3,can't translate xena into books,"now for as good as the show is, i have not read one book that even comes close to getting the feel of the tv show. i reccomendthat all true fans get out your vcr tapes and watch it. the booksare boring."
4,Shah Rukh Kahn is such a comedian,"I rented this and the quality was poor, but I liked the story and dancing and of course Shah Rukh Kahn."
1,Faulty product,This converter was a disaster. We carefully checked all the settings for the various electrical devices we were using and the converter still melted and caused our appliances to spark. We purchased a much more inexpensive little converter in the UK to replace this one and it worked perfectly!
1,Dies after warranty period,"As an early adopter I appreciate the Muvo's wonderful features as all other high reviewers had mentioned. The noise during playback was annoying, but I mainly use the unit to record cassette into MP3s. After 4 months of usage, it suddenly died, as all other low reviewers experienced. But at least their warranty is still in effect. Since the warranty runs out in 3 months, I would have to pay $25 to have the priviledge to learn how much more I will be charged in order to get the unit fixed. At this time, I wouldn't want to pay $25 for even a new unit!"
1,IT BROKE.,"My Muvo Micro player worked fine for like, a month. Then the problems started. I'd turn it on, and the screen would flash, and then die. I used several batteries to try to fix the problem. Now it doesn't turn on altogether. This is more of a plea for help rather than a bashing. Does anyone know how to fix this?! And suggestions?!"
1,What a Boring Story...,"Each time I opend this book, I had the earge to close my eyes and fall a sleep. I can't stand when men are portraid as door mats and that's what I thought about Adair MacTaran. He has NO head on his shoulders.Whatever. Never again am I reading anything by Margaret Moore!"
1,"A terrible, aggravating toy","If this toy worked as shown, it would be great. However, if you don't have the figure on the wheel just so, it doesn't fall right and doesn't get picked up. Also, after the figure gets picked up, it doesn't always fall right into the next area. In addition, it requires a second figure for the full effect, but only comes with one. I should have returned it to the store!"
3,A Little Disappointed.,"The book arrived on time and well packaged. My only criticism is that the first 31 pages had excessive handwritten notes including some text completely crossed out. I know I purchased a used book but based on the description I was expecting a cleaner copy. The remaining 285 pages, however, were like new."
1,Disappointed with the results,"Unlike most of the people reviewing this camera, I was very disappointed with the results. After reading the Amazon reviews, I rushed to buy the Canon EOS Rebel 2000. I thought that even though I am not a professional photographer the camera would be simple and produce the professional results I wanted. To my surprise, after developing at least 6 rolls, ALL of the photos have been of poor quality. They are grainy looking. I am going to buy a regular old point and shoot because I do not want to continue to miss precious moments of my three children."
4,Satisfied with purchase.,"I've had this camera for a little over a month, needed it for my photography class. It works, get the job done, and pretty easy to use. Price was a little high for my budget but it's fine now."
4,Photo student,I needed the camera for a photography one class and it got the job done. mine didnt come with a manual so it wasnt as easy for me to figure out how to use it but it was worth the $100 i bought it for.
2,"poor writing, people not acting like people, misleading plot trick","Recently I read a bookFather: Unknown (Harlequin Super Romance)with a ``surprise'' ending: a big point of the plotwas that the woman was two months pregnant, but the hero had lastbeen with her three months ago. The surprise at the end was that the doctorswere wrong and she was in fact three months pregnant. Surprises like this area poor trick used to enhance the main characters' problems and instead ofresolving the problem by coming to grips with a very difficult situation,instead dissolve them so everything is solved without any real personal growth.This book uses the same sort of trick with the claim of hero's death.I could forgive this, except the people in this book don't act like real people: it ishard to sympathize with people who don't move on. Five years is a long time.The plot is chaotic with jumping between people and time periods."
5,Excellent resource for parents!,"""Getting the Lead Out"" is an invaluable resource for parents with children who suffer from lead poisoning. It discusses sources of lead exposure, methods for preventing lead poisoning, and evaluation and treatment of lead poisoning. Critically, the book also provides parents with advice on how to cope with lead poisoning and how to protect their families. The text is clear, thorough, and not overly technical.I work in the area of lead toxicity and found this book to be highly accurate and informative. I would recommend this book wholeheartedly to any friend or colleague who has a loved one with lead poisoning or who wants to learn more about the subject."
5,steps,the steps are of fine quality they even hold me but can't get dogs to step up on them. go figure dogs.
4,Old Cat Lifesaver,"At first my 16 year old cat was reluctant to use this over her last pet stairs, which was becoming too short for her to reach my bed safely. The top step is perhaps two inches narrower than the first step, and my cat balked at going up these steps for about a week. But after using it a few times she is happy with it and seems to use these steps more now than with her old steps. I might have given 5 stars if the steps were an inch or two wider. I am very pleased with this purchase."
5,Great !,"I don't know how I got by without these ! No more picking up my dog every 5 minutes. These are very sturdy, and durable. My dog took to them immediately. Great purchase."
4,Great if your pet will actually use it!,"My chihuahua and pomeranian have both had trouble getting up onto my bed, so I ordered this to help them. The height was perfect and the structure was pretty stable. It even makes a dandy footrest. The only problem was... my dogs refused to use the steps! I showed them how several times, lured them up with food, and while my pom used them a few times, my chihuahua refused. I decided to return them, and Amazon made it pretty easy. On the day UPS picked the steps up, both dogs jumped on the bed... just to spite me.So these steps are great as long as your pet will use them."
2,Not suitable for middle-size or large breeds,I bought these from my local Pet store. The steps were way too small and narrow for my 50lb boxer. I can see these being great for small breeds though.
2,Disappointment,"This CD i bought is a used CD. It is labelled 'like new'. However, when I received it, the box is broken. it is a big disppointment to me."
3,Not good as desired,"It seems there is only one theme in all the songs. If these songs are seperated in the period of a film, I can take it. But play in a roll as a CD? Disappointing! Just like there is only one song in the CD."
2,Probably a good read for young adults,"The storyline was pretty grim and told from the perspective of a 19 year-old girl. It was not bad, but not particularly engaging for an adult reader. Younger readers might like it. Plus, the passages written in French were full of grammar mistakes. It made the book seem a little amateurish."
2,I am not a fan,"No Spoiler here.The good thing first. The author has a wonderful way with the written word and I was hopeful and eager in the beginning and because of this I gave it 2 stars.The bad, it is very depressing. The character was a tortured soul and there was nothing the reader could identify with. The main character needed intense therapy and doesn't get it in this story. I read to the end hoping there was something to love about this woman and at the end there was one small glimmer of hope that she would find some happiness but the reader knows in the end it will never be enough to save her soul.Everything in this novel is graphic and ugly and I am sorry I purchased it. I don't think I will ever read one of her novels again."
2,Not what I expected,"This was easy to read and short. It wasn't really what I expected, with not much of a story/plot. There was a lot of French words/phrases, but the author usually included the English translation."
2,Boring book,I felt that this book was rather boring. It had potential but it dragged too much and the author did not sell the story line.
4,nice mix of sophisticated club jazz ...,"I bought this on a whim in a local music store and have now come back and purchased the first Cafe Roma from Amazon ...Vol 2 is very cool ... my wife instantly liked it ... she's an excellent dancer and is into latin jazz music , samba , etc ..The Cafe Roma series provides excellent sexy-cool, upbeat background music for parties ... the ladies dig it ;-)Better than the Hotel Costes series ...cheers .."
2,pretty lame,just two good matches that made this a ppv. rock/shamrock/mankind cage match and austin/taker/kane match.
1,BORING AND STUPID,EVERYTHING SUCKED.THE TRIPLE THREAT MATCH WAS OKAY BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT SUCKED.I ABSOLUTLY HATED THE LAST MATCH.I DON'T RECOMMEND IT AT ALL.
4,yeah,Ok.Dont get me wrong it was okay.The tripple threat cage match was great.I could go on and onn.All I have to say is see it at least 2 times.
4,Good for a couple matches,"The main event was not very good, the best match was the triple threat cage match. Buy this if u are a huge wrestling fan because of the one great match."
3,Here's the breakdown on Breakdown...,"Every since Steve Austin won the WWF title at Wrestlemania 14 Vince McMahon has tried to 'mold' his new champion, trying to re-shape him into a more flexiable corporate Rattlesnake. But each attempt failed. So Vince McMahon has revealed his Masterplan to rid the WWF of the Texas Rattlesnake. Kane and Undertaker - the single most destructive force in the history of the WWF - have formed a deadly alliance. Led by McMahon the two have set their sights on Austin and more importantly the WWF title. All they have to do is co-exist for twenty minutes and destroy Stone Cold. But when a beaten and semi-conscious Austin lays flat on his back in the middle on the ring, the demonic brothers begin arguing over who should get the pin... the main event is the only appealing match on the card, as is often the case, this video serves merely as a stepping stone between two storylines. Not very good viewed on it's own but a great build up to the next pay-per-view: Judgment Day."
1,Dog Food,This book is not worth buying. You could do as well by just cooking anything yourself and giving it to your dog. This has no special recipes that are dog specific and evaluated for their nutritional content. (which is what I expected)
5,Love the recipes. The dogs love them more.,"I think cooking for your dogs is a great way to make sure they are getting quality food. It is still important for them to eat dry dog food, but if you want to add something extra to their diet, don't buy the canned stuff or even the the stuff that looks like real food in the commercials. When you read the ingredients for those things, you'll see they are terrible! Not only does this book have recipes for natural, wholesome softfood, but it also has recipes for snacks/treats."
1,Not very useful,I don't really find this book to be very useful. The recipes don't seem to have balanced healthy ingredients that my dogs would like and I would like to give them. And all of the pictures show the food on top of a bowl of kibble. Why is that? Is that supposed to show how to feed it to your dogs?
3,Not Practical,"This is a cute book with a cute dog on the cover. Thats about it really. I like to cook and do so every night for me and my husband. It would take more work to cook a meal out of this book for my dogs than it would to make dinner for us. Most of the recipes are a little expansive, and not too mention some use raisins and onions. Both of which are poisenous to dogs. I don't understand that one."
3,Cooking for my Dogs.,"I really thought it would have less pasta,and more natural ingredients. I read sometheres that dogs can't digest pasta as well."
4,A good sealant,Moisturized your hair first and seal it with the spray it makes a great combined pack with leave in conditions provided they are moisture base.
5,Rice cooker,"It is a great unit, expensive but you get what you pay for. It takes a while to cook the brown rice, but it is the tastiest rice ever!"
1,Looks good but fills up with water,"This is the 3rd. one I had to replace do to water leaking into the the unit. The cord grip seals at the cord but around the outside where the cord enters the transformer it allows water to get in. The transformer is potted with a black tar mixture, but it is poorly done and water gets into the electronics and shorts it out. At about $100.00 each this becomes expensive. Buying just the raw transformer means you have to make some kind of container to put it in. Since this option still costs about $65 you don't save very much. If I could buy the raw transformer for around $20 (which is all it should cost), then it would pay to make a container to put it in. For five years I've been using an old Gamma transformer by Current USA but it seems that it is no longer made."
4,More than a dummies book,"This book provides the fastest way to start using Rebol effectively. Covers alot of ground with many examples and effective explanations. I think the author decided to do a 'dummies' book so that he could occasionally insert some humor, and do examples that build off earlier examples. It definitely covers more material than the typical dummies book, and will be useful for the software professional. One of Rebols main bragging rights is its effectiveness at forming dialects. This book only used 30 pages to cover the parsing/dialect topic, --I would have liked more on this topic. The book included a very good treatment of how to get a server up and running using Rebol. Highly recommended, good introduction to a language which may well replace perl."
1,It Might Have Been Good,"I've been looking for orchestral music (Preludes, Overtures, etc.), from Zarzuelas, and read about this. I got it and when it started it sounded nice but not full selections, just short excerpts banded together. What really spoiled it was that after a few bars they added the dumbest electronic rhythm thump...thump...thump dubbed in! It just ruined the music! This music didn't need a soulless electronic beat added to it. The album is now on my get-rid-of-it shelf."
2,Incomplete,"The problem with GURPS Autoduel is that it doesn't give you what you need to run an Autoduel campaign. Almost all of the rules for designing cars and for car to car combat are in GURPS Vehicles. Given that Vehicles is a terrifying mass of badly organized systems, this is a pretty serious problem. They really should have gone ahead and reprinted the relevant rules here, hopefully in a more organized form.Autoduel spends most of its space giving write-ups of every major city in a degenerate USA. It is essentially a pre-made campaign setting, but without a lot of details."
3,Looks nice,They look very nice and formal2X they came with cracked piecesI called macys they fixed it right awayThe cups were the wrong sizeQuality is not that greatOk for the priceI would not buy them againThey break easily and dont lastFinish ware's off
5,THE FIRST CD IN A WHILE TO TOUCH ME WHERE NO ONE HAS,"THIS IS A CLASSIC, ONE OF A KIND PERFORMER. JOHN BLUE'S MUSIC IS UNIVERSAL AND TO LISTEN TO THE WORDS, MAKE ME WONDER WHAT THIS MAN HAS BEEN THROUGH IN COMBAT, TO BE ABLE TO EXPRESS IT IN SONG-NOT BITTERNESS BUT THOUGHT PROVOCAING SONGS, FROM ""TOO LONG IN THE RAIN"" (MY FAVORITE) TO ""THROUGH THE THICK AND THE THIN"" REMARKABLE TALENT."
3,Designated Reader,"On occasion, I've been known to equate reading Slavoj Zizek to being stone cold sober and following around a drunk. The experience opens the potential for humor, confusion, deep, heart-felt, uninhibited discussion, time wasting, inappropriateness and even some danger. While that might not sound so pleasant, The Parallax View is worth the outing.In the six chapters and two interludes, Zizek's approach and style is more soberly than usual. Although it is still sometimes difficult to discern what specific point he is attempting to reveal from his profound understanding of philosophy, psychoanalysis, politics and culture.Zizek's `rock star' status as a contemporary philosopher will only be enhanced by this work. And I love the ending--spoiler alert--not here, you'll have to read it for yourself."
1,Go with Chicken-of-the-Sea,"When I was a kid my mother swore by Chicken-of-the-Sea's tuna products. When I got out on my own I decided to give Starkist a try because it was generally a little bit cheaper. Terrible mistake. I purchased 3 cans of the solid white in water and each can had unwanted surprises. In two of the cans I found multiple pieces of bones, just straight little pieces that really hurt if they jabbed your mouth. In the third can I had what appeared to be an entire round fish scale. It was disgusting! Pay the few extra cents for the better tuna...the fish may be the same but the cleaning and inspection processes with the more expensive brands are worth it."
5,"More, please!","This was one of the most enjoyable memoirs I've ever read. Ms. Halpern is a fantastic writer and memoirist, humorous, self-depracating, knowing, insightful, and brave.I reveled in all the '80s-decade fashion and pop culture references, and could really relate to her mishaps in school, as most will. Her family descriptions were utterly delightful, heartwarming and memorable. The chapters that she shared her experience with her powerful producer boyfriend/fiance were super-brave. He definitely did not appreciate fully what he let go.The chapter/essay about fragrances and how certain scents remind her of certain people were really relevant to me. I will forever think of my Grandma when I catch a whiff of Downy and White Shoulders.I can't wait to see what Ms. Halpern does for an encore. I look forward to it expectantly."
3,A cute little book,"""Target underwear and a Vera Wang Gown"" by Adeana Halpern is cute liitle book that the writer tells her life story so far, though the clothes that she has worn. It is not anything deep, but a nice book that can be enjoyed on either a plane or car ride."
1,Boring,I was so happy to see this in the Amazon box. But I have to say I really had to push myself to read it. It just didn't catch my attention.
3,disappointed,"I bought this item based on reading the reviews. I'm pretty dissapointed. It's Ok for watching movies, but, unless it's for a bedroom, or you have never had a real sound system, it's not sufficient for music. There is very little base. You can barely tell the sub is on. If you crank up the volume on the subwoofer enough so you can hear it, it just rumbles, which is not pleasing to the ear. They are cheap, so maybe my expectations were too high, or maybe these just weren't meant for music. I may try using my big JBL speakers for the front pair and not use the subwoofer. I've read the the next model up has a better subwoofer."
4,Great for the Price,"I have had these for a couple on months and have them hooked up to my Onkyo 509. When I first got them, they were hooked up to a cheap RCA receiver and I was not impressed. Now that I upgraded my receiver, I definitely notice a significant improvement in sound quality and range. The subwoofer is huge so finding a place for it remains an issue. I'm not an audio expert, but I know good sound when I hear it; I would recommend these speakers. However, if you have a cheap receiver, these won't improve your hearing experience much."
4,Excellent Starter System,"I'm no expert audiophile of course but the RM6750 will not disappoint anyone whose into movies, music and games on a starter budget. My home entertainment set-up includes a Panasonic plasma tv, Onkyo receiver, Sony PS3 for Blu-ray movies, Xbox 360 for games and these speakers are perfect for my present audio requirements. Fully aware that there are better speakers out there and will most likely upgrade to the next level (Monitors), income permitting but for now these are keepers. Don't forget to pair 'em with the Atlantic 77305018 Satellite Speaker Stands(Black)."
2,Waste Of Money dude....,window washer is for lazy people that can't open =internet options= and click the delete keysDon't be lazy & save $30.00
1,yadda yadda yadda,"This book is good to that people that has nothing to think about, nothing to worry about and know nothing about philosophy"
3,book,"I got my book today, it's in decent condition, I'm satisfied. It arrived in only days, I like that. Overall I'd say I would order from this seller again."
4,Required reading for all new network and system admins,"This should be required reading for all new network and system administrators, and for those people thinking about becoming a net/sysadmin."
2,Does it really do what it says?,"I got Net Nanny to test and see whether it really blocks ""surprises"" from teen and children. So, I set up the account with restricted access to the internet. The level was about 75% restricted. When I opened some sites, it was a surprise indeed. I was able to open Playboy.com with ease and navigate. On the other hand, my research group website was blocked and so was The Economist website!!I am sure there are pop-ups and links on websites which can lead a child to sites like Playboy. They DO have the option of adding websites to their ""restricted websites"" page but Net Nanny has not done her homework if a well-known site like playboy is not blocked!! I wonder what other websites remain to be blocked.(...)"
2,"Good features, terrible side effects","After downloading this software, there was a noticeable negative impact to our computer. Lock ups almost constantly, slow internet speed, and even slower response on other PC applications that should not have been impacted by this program. We were running this on a Windows 98 OS with a PIII 600mhz computer and 128m RAM. Rather disappointing.I like this program's features but not at the expense of having to re-boot my computer constantly. I'd look elsewhere for a good Internet Protection software program."
2,Poorly Written,"This book does have some hot scenes, but it is just poorly written. It can be fun, but this is not a book I would recommend for a good read. There are many other books that are just as action packed where the authors actually have some skill."
4,More Laughes then your Bacholor Party,"This is a very funny semi-adult game. I would recomend it for 16 up, not because it is unsafe for kids, but I just dont think they would get the humor in it. The point is to remain the least-marragable person. The ""mother"" will try to find reasons you should do something that makes you marketable as ""marrage material"" and it is your job to use excuse cards to get out of it. But your friends can always add other cards to make it harder for you to resist. Its a great small party game, and I would definately recomend it for Bacholer/Bachelorette parties. Good for Singles and Couples who like to have fun."
5,Dirty Harry Strikes Again,What can you say about Clint Eastwood except Awesome. These movies are some of Eastwood's best. When I saw the collection I simply had to have it and I have not been disappointed with it.
1,Can't hear it,"As opposed to the earlier review, volume is my problem. I've used it for 6 months, and nothing has broken, except my patience and ear trying to hear anything less than concert-level speech from the callers. If they talk DIRECTLY into there mouthpiece, slowly, I am able to hear, forget about the crap that passes for cel-phone, I have to switch to another. Since a hands-free is somewhat loose by definition, having less than Loud volume to overcome this is inexcusable. Pressing my 'hands-free into my ear in order to make out what is being said is self-defeating.Can anyone tell me why a phone with a volume control doesn't have a *too loud* ability, how hard can that be? Sorry plantronics, your fully functional 'hands-free' just fell in the garbage. Please grow a clue."
1,How about no stars?,"This was one of the worst books I've ever read, and I LOVE to read. I had to get on here to see if it was just me. Glad to see it's not! Don't waste any of your life reading this."
2,Too much like a previous title,"While I have been a fan of Fern Micheals for many years, I found this book to be predictable and improbable. The story line did not seem well researched and the main characters fell in love way too fast. Also, the plot had too much in common with her previous novel Annie's Rainbow. While Annie's Rainbow was unique and interesting, this book seemed to be rushed and poorly written. It smacked of being written to make a deadline. Fern Michaels is a much better writer than this and I was quite disappointed."
1,Not good,I didn't the like book at all. The story was lame and the romance was luke warm that was more boring than anything I have ever read. Just couldn't finish it. This was my first and last book from this author. Good thing that I only paid a quarter for it at a used bookstore otherwise I would not be very happy.
4,"""Twitch"" is the word!","If there truly IS a ""Rock and Roll Heaven,"" Fred Flintstone and that particular episode's ""Rock Roll"" characters' places are assured therein, just simply because of that immortal lyric: ""...Well, we'll twitch around the clock tonight in Bedrock - TWITCH...TWITCH..."""
3,Good quality with a few flaws,"It seems to be well made and sturdy. I bought it for my 96 year old father. He had trouble with being able to squeeze the handle hard enought to apply pressure on the grabbers. I thought it was easy but he could not do it. I thought the grabber tips should have been made of platic that was a bit more ""sticky"". The tips are made of a somewhat hard plastic/rubber."
5,Great product,I have been looking for one of these for my mother and was sooooo glad I purchased this style. The triggers on the other products were hard to squeeze and offered no real stability on the grasping handle. This handle fits in her hand with a natural squeezing motion using all four fingers. The square handle rests on the hand offering more stability. Don't waste your money on triggers if someone you love has arthritis in their hands.
5,Impressed!,The book was at the best price and in excellent condition!! I appreciate this business' integrity. Keep up the good work!
3,Not as good as the first one.,"I had to buy this because I wanted to have all the Ray Gillen tracks asociated w/ Sun Red Sun. Unfortunatly, the only tracks to feat. Ray on vocals were on the first release. Still, in spite of the fact that John West is singing on this, the cd is quite good... or at least what I was expecting... seeing as how ""lost tracks"" ususally imply demos or things that were never meant to be released. Romano's playing is again, very good. He can really riff and solo. And as for singer John West, well, I've never been a fan of his voice, but I can tolerate it just because I like the music."
1,A Major Disappointment,"When I heard that the first RPG for gamecube was coming out, I immediately pre-ordered it. When I finally got it, I was shocked!IT [was weak]. The movement was awkward, and the camera angles were just... wierd! When I finally started to understand the battle system, I was even more [upset], because that [was weak] too! You collect these cards, use them in battle, and with one use, it disappears! You can easily get [confused] if you aren't extremely careful with your cards. All in all, I put this game down a few hours in and sold it to my friend. And it is a decision that I don't regret...."
2,Too Short!,"Dont get me wrong. Lost Kingdoms is a very nice card rpg. But while it's supposed to take 20 hours to finish, it took me 5 hours. i recommend renting this game, not buying it."
2,A Let Down,"I would like to start by saying that this game is by no means the hardest game you'll ever come across. The battle system can be a bit confusing and they lack clarity when explaining it to some extent. It is a difficult game but nothing overly hard.The game's real downfalls are its graphics and music. The background music will get old fast. After an hour you'll want to hurl your gamecube into a wall. The graphics, while some think otherwise, aren't that great. The game does not use the gamecube's power.All in all the game is a let down. If you really wish to give it a go I suggest renting it before you buy. It is by no means a game that is a must have. After a little while everything in it will drive you crazy but I suppose if you are willing to look past all its flaws it is an okay, short play."
1,"""Lost Kingdoms"" is ""Lost Bust""","I rented this game and I was very disapointed.When you think RPGyou thinkwalk around talk ,walk around fight,collect.This you walk around fight,lose,die.The girl a big wuss.You are better off buying an action adventure game or even Pokemon."
2,short boring card game,"its a bad game with an original concept. use cards and points to battle foes. the cards come to life similar to baten kaitos, and phantasy star online 3"
1,Classic Romertopf arrived broken,"It arrived and when I opened it, it had a crack in the bottom part. I have been looking for a way to contact you, but there is not a link for that! So I carefully re-wrapped the clay cooker, and returned it to sender - it cost me $27 to return it. I know you received it - I want an exchange if possible.Did you reimburse me for the cooker??? How about the postage?I shall never buy from your 'holier than thou' attituded site again. Take my credit card off your system - and refund my postage for the exchange!"
4,Love my Romertopf until it cracked,"I bought this claypot April 2012. I love cooking in it. So easy and tasty. I made whole chickens, chicken parts, pork loin and roasts, baked beans, lamb shanks etc, also added veggies, whatever I had in my fridge, for a complete and easy meal. Until it crack on the bottom. I was always careful about temperature extremes, placing the pot on silicon trivets, soaking it before placing it in a cold oven etc. However, last night after a wonderful lamb shank dinner, after the pot cooled, I added water to the bottom to soak overnight (like I usually do) and the next morning it leaked all over my counter top. Bummer. This pot deserves five stars because of its performance. Its like having a super fast crock pot in your oven but the food comes out tasting great! Leaves your oven clean, no splattering of grease on your oven walls. I love it so much that I'm ordering a replacement. Hopefully this one lasts longer than 6 months."
4,Best Combat Flight Game of the mid 90's,This was my favorite combat flight game ever. The controls are easy to use and the missions are clear and concise.You participate in an Island hopping campaign in the pacific theater during WWII. The majority of the beggining missions originating from Henderson Field.By todays standards this game is no where near a flight simulator. It is a quick learn and you will be flying and fighting in no time.If your into flight simulator games you would probably want to stay clear of this game. However if you like a good dogfight and an old fashioned shoot-em up game I would rate this a 5 by mid 90's standards.
4,Good!,The Great Muppet Caper is the second movie in the Muppet movie series and I liked it and thought it was cute and I enjoyed the guest appearances by famous celebrities. I had this movie on a pan and scan video tape but I gave it to my little cousins because I'm going to get the widescreen DVD!
5,A Message From Mr. Movie Buff,"The second besst Muppet Movie ever! This movie stars Kermit and Fozzie as twin newspaper reporters, and Gonzo as thier photographer. After losing their jobs, the trio travels to England to solve the case of Lady Holiday's jewel thefts. While there, Kermit meets Miss Piggy and has a great adventure after Miss Piggy is framed, and Kermit, Fozzie, and Gonzo along with the rest of the gang have to work to bring the real thieves to justice! This was definitely one of the best mysteries I've ever seen, and would have been my favorite Muppet Movie, but The Muppets Take Manhattan edged it out. I loved the story, the Muppets couldn't have been funnier, and you just had to love Animal! A movie for all types."
5,great pan!,"love this pan! heavy!!!!!! but that's what i wanted a great quality roaster this made the best, moist turkey on thanksgiving i can remember!also great pot roast thanks so much!,patty"
2,We find this to be very LOUD,"We received this as a gift for our son when he turned one. However, it is so loud. Very loud! It is currently hidden away in a closet to give us(the grown ups) a little break from it. It is a fun, durable and exciting toy for our kids to play with. But.....it is soooo loud. When it is pushed around the house at a higher speed it is extremely loud. If it goes more slowly, it isn't so bad, but this doesn't seem to be as exciting for the kids! I appreciate the design otherwise and the male and female recycling workers that it comes with."
5,Bring On Volume Two,"Each sports team has its stars, and and each one has its cult heroes. And all teams have those players that are forgotten nationally, but the utterance of whose name can bring a smile to the face of a fan long after that player has retired.Steve Buckley, or ""Buck,"" as he's known to his Boston sports writing readers, has selectively pulled names from Red Sox history and, in some cases, revived them from the land of the forgotten. The only problem with a book like this - when written properly - is that it leaves the fan hungry for more. Bring on Reid Nichols! Where is Bob Zupcic? Show me Jack Brohamer! I'd love to see Buck follow up this book with another volume."
4,Great Pan,Have yet to see any break down of covering...wonderful non-stick pan. Would buy more and will when I next order.
1,Definitely Used.,"When I finally opened this book to read and take the self-evaluation tests within, I was truly disappointed to find that the previous owner of the book had underlined and taken the tests - often in ink! When I choose a ""nearly new,"" I don't expect this much marking of a book. Too bad."
1,skip it,"a weak contribution to the career change / self discovery topic.i've read a few books in the category in the last year, and found this one bland and poorly organized.if you haven't read anything on career change, it's worth the $1 or so you can pay for a used copy for on amazon; but don't buy new.still -- skip this and look at ""what should i do with my life"", ""the pathfinder"" and ""in transition"" and then take a strong or briggs myers survey online; doing so will be more productive.i read this book after i'd already decided to leave my unfulfilling job, but from other reviews it appears that the book is a catalyst to get people off their butts and go for a change, which is of course a good thing, so i don't want to be too critical, but it did nothing for me."
3,Mainly Written For Those In Their Mid-careers,"I've had this book for a while, and recently went over it again. The exercises and self-assessment questions where somewhat helpful, and the others require brainstorming. There's a section where it asks to select/identify skills based on experience, and when I did this, I figured, my current skills seemed too limited, since I haven't acquired most of the skills listed. I just think that this is mainly written for experienced professionals in their mid-careers; anyone may benefit from some exercises and topics, but I'm still not quite satisfied for some reason, so I decided to buy another one, ""The Pathfinder,"" by Nicholas Lore."
2,O.K,"This a good read for someone of desperate nature of a change. I did not find it helpful, but I do think it could be useful to someone who is completely lost."
4,Excellent for Live Play through house PA,"Got this unit and compared side-by-side with Line 6's Floor POD Plus for use through the PA system at my church. I was woried that the Amp Modeling function would not be very good, but I was pleasantly wrong. The line-out function into the house PA provides excellent sound. The amp-modeling is transparent to the user, and you can focus on your effects while the ME-50 manages the amp modeling to automatically give a good sound.The metal housing and heavy duty knobs were also far superior to the Line 6 Unit. In fairness, this unit costs more than the Line 6.Only downside is that you cannot switch thru the 10 saved sound banks with your foot, so you can only have 3 pedal settings plus whatever has been manually set for 4 settings during a song. Conversely the Line 6 provides extra pedals to allow switching sound banks on the fly. This is a minor issue for me, however, since I only use a few saved settings."
4,A Very Useful Reference,"Although there are much newer versions of Photoshop released at this time, I wanted to express that this book has been a great help to me over the years with graphic design. It has a very comprehensive format that covers many features of this software, and it also gives you great examples throughout demonstrating unique ideas. I keep it on hand for quick reference. The only draw back to this book, is that it is quite large compared to other quick reference software books."
1,A Disappointing sequel,"the sequel to one of the best rpg games with the best story line is a total and complete flop. breath of fire 2 does not follow anything even remotly like a story and is not in any way realated to the first game.the game should have had some thing to do with defeating Tyr after she comes back at the end of Breath of Fire 1. the fighting is different and when i tried to select a enemy to fight out of 3 enemies, i ended up shooting myself. what is probably the worst part about fighting is when you meet a new enemy. you can't see how much health they have so it is frustarating not knowing how long until you kill them. the graphics are horrible and are worse than any game i have ever played. the hunting in this game is extremly disipointing and you spend the time waiting for a deer or boar to come out of the grass. if you are looking for a good RPG, play Breath of Fire 1 or Golden Sun"
2,Game of bygone days,"this is truely a game of a lesser era. the game starts out in your home town, and you are a little kid, and theres this eye that that seems to be watching you and you go around looking for your little sister and thats all cool but after that its all kind of boring, you go around and kill a buch of corney looking mosters and try to get your dog friend out of jail, a series of sub missions ensue and other people join up with you etc. its all written like a B movie. the monster graphic are ok, but the land background and main characters animations and graphics are lame. I would have to say that this might have cut it if this was 1987 but tody its not worth the [money]."
4,Mahogany Timbre,"I love the rich mahogany timbre of her voice. Refreshing and heartfelt choice of material, perfect economy of production and sidemen that are the cream of the Brazil/NY crop.Worth the import price as there is only a smattering of her vocals on others cd's, i.e. Charlie Byrd, Kenny Barron, Duduka da Fonseca."
3,"XP, Vista, and soon to be Windows 7","When I first purchased these remotes (at one time, I had three of them) they worked great... Well almost. Windows XP and up users beware. There have not been any upgrades to this product for quite some time. Unless you are really good at editing or creating XML files, I would discourage the purchase of this product. Another drawback is that SnapStream has abandonded the Beyond Media part of the package. I've had to really fight with this product to produce minimal results and I've constantly had to uninstall and reinstall the drivers on Windows Vista.I'm told it works with a Girder plug-in but I have never used it. It is an additional purchase so I feel this product is misleading in it's advertisements."
2,"A trashy romp, but not Sharon Green's Best","Written, I suspect, during a very dry spell during the author's romantic life! Haughty Spirit is certainly a fun book in the terms of Anne Rice's ""Sleeping Beauty"" trilogy, but the story is simplistic. Sharon Green's fantasy novels usually have much more character development and intrigue - making them impossible to put down, and worthy of a dozen re-reads. This book was a one-time read and then I actually gave it away - something I NEVER do with her other fantasy books (in fact, I usually require a Deposit of valuable property just to BORROW them!).Haughty Spirit is good for a rainy Saturday night with no date, but it certainly qualifies as the least impressive of her works to date."
4,Excellent research- but requires dedication,"The book is nicely written and expertly researched, but without reading as a companion to the Mabinogion it gets a little hard to read. The author warns you of this in the beginning, so the responsibility is with the reader. It is wonderfully done, with excellent insights."
2,Errors overshadow lovely content,"EeeeK!At $21 for such a little book you thing someone would have taken the time to proofread this material! Spelling mistakes galore! I LOVED the subject matter but literally could not finish it because it was painfully obvious that someone took a bunch of working notes and tossed them together in a hurried manner. This project would have been wonderful had it been taken seriously. In the past I have found Janet Farrar to be a good writer, too bad her publisher let her down on this one. Only two stars.... yes Matilda I do feel ripped off."
5,One of my favorites by Ramsey Campbell,"I think this is one of Campbell's best books. If you liked ""In the Darkest Part of the Woods"", you'll like this book more. It's a page turner, and it'll stick with you long after you've finished it."
3,"Good, but flawed, effort","This is a good, post-apocalyptic premise, and I won't write much about the plot; others have done that and I can't add much. I'm only giving it 3 stars because the writing is so stiff. The author never uses one word when two (or even three) will do. Also, the dialogue between characters is so stilted that it tended to jolt me out of the action. I noticed that there were other installments to come. The author's style loosened up enough by the end of the book that I'll probably read them, though."
2,Undecided,"This book left me with many mixed emotions. The episodic nature of the chapters made the narative seem fragmented and would completely take me out of the story. I love the concept but the execution was too off-kilter for me to say that I actually enjoyed the book. I am seriously debating whether to try another in the series to see if the clumsiness of ""Way of the Wolf"" is due to it being a debut novel or if the style is just that way. Definitely borrow this book before you buy it. (or get a cheap used copy)"
3,arrived as promised,"It wasn't as flavorful as other yellow curry pastes - It was just OK, not the bright yellow color I was hoping for in my finished dish."
3,Useless Without Access to CD Edition Files,"Like all Kindle editions of guitar instruction books, this one is pretty much a Fail since you cannot access the sample music files that came on the original paperbound CD edition book. Amazon is very understanding and fair regarding this issue and quickly refunded my money and disabled the book on my Kindle for Mac. Fair Dinckum!"
4,Solid Expansion,"Tribunal is a very good expansion with many hours of gameplay in it. I played for about a month just in Mournhold, completing every last quest I could get my greedy hands on. Then I went back to a save game and killed Almalexia! My favorite quest is when the little wood elf asks you to help him beat up a Nord. I did beat up the Nord, but then I killed him, so everyone else attacked me. Thankfully, I saved previously, so I killed both the wood elf and the innkeeper and took their money. Then I went back to a save game."
4,Don't judge a game by it's box,"OK ""Jimmy"" let's see... 1 good point about this game= RPG is a role playing game every one has a role. The battle system is not what makes a RPG. 2. This game is for MegaMan fans that have been with the series all the way from NES to GBA. So you most likly wouldn't know. 3. An 11-year old is a pre-teen don't call 'em a kid this game was fun for my brother who is 24. 4. MegaMan fans will love it 'cause most people don't care whether its an rpg or not. P.S. I can't write reveiws very well."
2,Great expectations...,"I loved Pierre Moelen's work up until my collection ended with Pierre Moelen's Gong Live (Arista 1980)His work took you to the uppermost reaches of the musical stratosphere and often beyond.Inspirational drumming throughout his journey with Daevid Allen's Gong and its other mutations, and then his forray into differing fusions with various almost mythical (Now) musicians, ala Holdworth etc, was just that, inspiring.I was fortunate enough to see him in concert with Mike Oldfield, which was an absolute musical feast, and never to be forgotten.This last effort however, left me cold.The instrumentation was lacklustre and very predictable.Whilst I am sure they,(the ensemble) are accomplished musicians, it all sounded very tired.Pierre's drumming was not enhanced by very average recording dynamics.Do we expect too much of our idols?A legacy has been given though, for all to enjoy."
4,its a nightmare come true!,"This game scared the pants of me! I loved it! This game has everything from hot ladies to the blood and gore everyone loves! This game has a ton of things that made jump out of my seat in the first ten minunites!!!This game is for someone who likes having nightmares for weeks or someone who likes being scared to death. If I chose to rent it or buy it, I would say rent it because you going to get your life sucked out of you if you play too much."
5,Great Game From A RE Fan,I was amazed when I saw that Resident Evil was getting remaked for GC. It's great! I love the remake and feel that the story makes justice of what the game was in 1996. The graphics were out of this world and it was great. I give this game 5 stars for everything. I think Capcom was great at remaking it and I think they did a great job in it. NuyoRicanLuvsU@aol.com
5,this game rock's,"the main theing that gets me that the graphics are incredible. with shadow effects and real lighting this game will easily become one of the bigest hits for the game cube consol.with details like this your world will be shaken.although it is on two disks it is on of the greatist games you will ever play on the game cube consol, and the newly made attack style this game in my mind get a 5 out of 5, all around amazing"
4,Great game,"Excellent remake, I prefer it more than the original PS1 game. This game also shows how amazing the graphics on the Gamecube can be."
5,So beautiful!!,"I'll just comment on the case itself, not the game (because we all know what a classic game this is). When it says ""Like New"", it is DEFINITELY like new! It still felt like a game when you first take the plastic wrapping off. Wonderful, Grade A quality!"
4,Resident evil,this is one of the most terrifying games you will ever play. the graphics are just that intense. but i love it. the zombies are so real that you feel as they'll pop out of the screen and eat you.
3,I guess it's ok,"RE1 is same on wii so mostly, i have played it before. The game starts you of with Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine. The game is cool, but the start is annoying. The reason is if you pick Chris, the only weapon he carries is a wimpy knife. The other thing annoying is when Barry tells you to split up and look, you can't go through the doors until you ""look around"" and go back to Barry. The other thing that bothers me is you can't leave things behind like RE0 lets you do. Still, the graphics are good and the game is fun, but it's not the best game."
5,"I can't believe it, They made the Original even more scarier","They've taken a classic and totally revamped it. And I must say it's hard to sleep at night. This is the scariest game of all time. Anyone that says different is probably too worried that there man-hood is at stake saying any different. Get it, especially cause its so cheap now.And when your finished, get the Resident Evil 4 which to me is just as good. A gaming classic at it's best!"
3,"The good, the bad and the downright ugly",This compilation was released termed as the definitive Devo collection and in some ways it has to be viewed as somewhat of a success. Unfortunately though the second CD is horrible - it shows the band degenerating into an awful novelties band. But viewed on the bands de-evolution process it's hard to fault really because it seems like it was going to happen anyway and it seems to click with the band's philosophy. Disc 1 however is fantastic and it shows everything that was great about Devo in the first place but when you place it next to Disc 2 you can see where everything went.If you're new to Devo I recommend Hot Potatoes or any of the single CD best-of's. They capture the band at it's peak. Otherwise this is more of a die-hard venture although it's still worth it for those tracks you'd have thought you could only get on their videos
2,"Big disappointment from the ""ridiculously simple"" series...","I generally like material put out by the ""ridiculously simple"" series. This text is a dud. The material covered is very shallow. I found the writing tedious and overly simplistic. If you want a good foundation in biochem go with Lehninger's Biochemistry along with Basic Medical Biochemistry by Marks, Marks, and Smith.I understand that this was not intended to be a detailed biochem text. However, the material here is beyond ""simplistic"". It is quite insufficient to appraise one with facts and or knowledge."
1,A waste of time,"A too simply and vague way to describe ""biochemistryland"". May be good for someone but certainly not for medical students preparing for the Boards."
4,waiting a doe,I have used this in the past and it works great. I have timed the unit and it works like clockwork lol.
3,Good for Beginners,"I was somewhat disappointed with this book. I am an Executive Assistant, and did not find too much information that I didn't already know. I was hoping for some insight from a wide selection of Executive Assistants, and there were different comments from the same 5 or 6 people. I do think it is a good book for someone who is just starting out, and I did appreciate a few of the sample worksheets."
1,Didn't work well at all,"We purchased this to stop one particular stray cat from using our flower bed as a litter box. Seems Shake Away didn't bother him at all. The area we wanted to keep him away from was only about 6' x 10' and with half of the 3 pound Shake Away sprinkled throughout it didn't make any difference at ALL...!!! We'll go to plan 'B' and save our money. Shake Away is too expensive for the coverage you get, and waaaaay too expensive for the lack of results. Maybe it works for keeping the meek bunnies away as others have said, but for stray cat's, forget it!"
1,Dreadful,"A two-hour concoction of public-domain material transferred from what appears to be 4 VHS tapes from 1988. Poor quality all around, ranging from blurry to blurrier to blurriest, with only one or two exceptions.All of the ads are public domain. You can download clearer copies from the Web."
4,grows on you,"Wow- some surprisingly negative reviews here.I've listened six or seven times and, other than the ""Robert Johnson"" song which is so-so but goes on way too long,or the boring Dylan cover which I skip, it's great. Yes, quite a somber mood overall, but lots of great stuff here and beautifully done. I do miss the harmonies and more pop oriented stuff because these guys can do anything, but I guess they just weren't feeling it. A shiny pop song or two would feel out of place here anyway, the mood is quite consistent. To put it in 60's terms, more like the Animals than the Hollies.Anyway, I love it and recommend it."
2,great for kids,"The Amazon Features: recommended this dictionary for age 9 to adult and this should have been a big clue. Generally 9 year olds and adults aren't looking for the same things in a product of this type. This is a cute program but all of it is freely available on the Web.My two biggest disappointments were the brief simplistic definitions and that it lacks cross-referencing or hyper-linking within a definition, -- yes, you can easily jump to new definitions from words within a given definition, but, for me, this lacks the learning that comes with hyper-linking.My last comment is that as of January 04, the reviews listed under this Medical Dictionary are reviews for other Merriam-Webster products, but not for the Medical Dictionary. Read closely and notice the reference to a thesaurus that the Medical Dictionary does not have."
5,Hand Reflexology by Mildred Carter and Tammy Weber,I bought this book for myself and was so impressed with it that I'm sending a copy to my friend in California. We are both little old ladies and need all the help we can get. Reflexology works!
3,Decent,This book was required for a mechanical engineering class I took and has good problems to work through. I am not impressed with the examples and graphics/figures within the book but it explains derivations decently.
3,"Good, But Bad","To start out let me tell you there are a lot of levels and they are all fun. That is probably why it is not rated 2 or 1 stars, but it has bad stuff like terrible graphics and poor camera angles. Do yourself a favor and rent it first, before deciding. I think you will be happy that you did."
2,OK,"This game is only fun if you have a friend playing with you. The graphics [are not great] in this game. They aren't in 3D and the idea of them having infinet axes, swords, arrows, knifes, magic, and bombs is stupid. It should be more up close fighting unless you are an archer and even then you shouldn't have unlimited arrows. The game should be more like Enclave or Zelda and you have to find or buy the stuff. You also shouldn't be able to buy stats, they should just increase as you get a higher level. You should also be able to have more than one type of weaponPros: multi player, a lot of guysCons: graphics, concept, weapons, plot"
1,"boring, [junk], speechless","I have no idea why i spent money on this piece of junk, it is the dumbest game ever. you just walk around, you hardly die, it's not even remotely challenging! How could this company even survive? Pacman was much more amusing than this. I mean seriously, the levels near the end of the game are like 30min long. it gets so annoying at the end, i duno why you'd even bother wasting your time getting out of the CD case. Spend your money somewhere else!! This is no where near an investment!!"
4,Let's go back!!!!,"This CD is great!!! I had it a while back and listening to it again brings me right back to the same places and times I was the 1st time around. My favorites are 3, 4, 5, and 7. Listen yourself and see what you think...."
3,THE theory?,Its treatment of the dynamics of entangled polymer is oversimplified in the nonlinear response regime. It offers a picture further away from the reality that chain entanglement produces rubbery network like responses during large deformations.
2,Sub-standard vesus standard,"This book tries to convince the reader that some sub-standard practices in spoken portuguese are after all standard. It goes to the extreme of distorting grammatical categories to make the argument look right. The sections on imperative and the pronouns are rather mixed up.The author should stick to the portuguese spoken on good brazilian TV programmes and that you read in interviews etc in reputable brazilian magazines. The worst is that this book is presented as suitable for foreigners. You want to learn standard, not sub-standard language!"
2,It is a matter of standards!,"This book is an attempt to explain the Portuguese language on both sides of the Atlantic and understand some of its colloquialisms specifically in Brazil. It contains useful information. What is wrong is trying to elevate some sub-standard practices to the status of standard language. It will be better to promote the colloquial, but correct, Portuguese used in Brazilian newspapers and good quality Brazilian magazines like for example Veja. Acknowledgment of colloquialisms is OK, promoting sub-standard language is not!"
1,Airport tycoon 2,"It has been very frustrating for my son as he can't get very far in setting up his ""airport"". The program keeps saying that he needs more ""control towers"" and when he adds more it makes no difference. Therefor he has not played with it after a few tries."
1,"I agree, this game is probably worse than the first one","this game is absolutely awful, I would have thought after all the complaints about the last game, and after working on the game for more than 2 years, the game would be a lot better,but the game is actually worse, there is less gameplay, there are still many glitches and the graphics were barely improved,I am very disapointed in this game, especially because of the nice poster they released last year (which showed some promise)"
1,Yawn...,"This game should be in the Platinum Hits sections. No, make that the Old Copper Penny section. Paying anything over 10 bucks for this game would be a mistake. Only hardened RPGers will like this game (you know the type--the guys who sit over by themselves and even the computer nerds won't talk to them). After Sudeki, Fable & Jade Empire comes out, Gladius will be relegated to the Bargin Bin right next to Pong. Anywho...this game is about as much fun as visiting a friend's dying grandmother in an old folks home (unless of course, you enjoy that sort of thing)."
2,GOOD BUT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,"THIS BOOK IS FASCINATING, HOWEVER IF YOU DON'T LIKE SCIENTIFIC READING IT MAY BE HARD TO FOLLOW. OTHERWISE ITS A GREAT READ IF ARE INTERESTED IN ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS AND EARTH'S MYSTERIES."
5,"Informative, mind-opening, exciting, and very fascinating.","It took awhile to read this book due to the math involved and the astronomy that I am not real knowledgeable about but their explanation of the Mayan calendar, theories, and the history they spelled out in this book were quite the eye-opener for me. It opened my mind and thoughts to a whole new world that is so much more realistic than I could have believed a few years ago. Excellent book! I learned alot from it and it sent my interests whirling!! What a truly awesome concept. Can't wait for their next book."
4,"Good book on writing, not much specific on SF","The general writing tips in this book are good, but I was a bit disappointed in the amount of tips specific for SF. There are few tips for fantasy, and almost no tips for horror writing. The book does handle basically all aspects of writing thoughs, from the first ideas and how to get them to how to find a publisher, so unless you already own books on writing this book is not a waste of money. I must say that in its further reading and publishing your book sections it is British-centered, but the general ideas there also hold true for America.If you're a beginning SF writer, this might be the book for you, but if you already own books on creative writing I'd save your money and try to find something else."
4,"Wonderful book about why GenX is still single, and how to change your attitudes","Wow, this book really nailed it as to the cultural influences that cause us to remain single. As a man that has been single and dated and struggled with whether to commit, I could relate to the - the feeling is gone, there might better, or especially, that I wanted a girl I could be close to but also be the rambuxcious player. The author said she found both traits in many men. Her chapter on Marriage Lite, about the ways that GenX tries to have companionship but avoid committment, was quite enlightening as I've done those strategies.The last chapter, and you cannot read it until the end, is about people who successfully found love. The stories were great. One of the stories (Michael and Olivia) reminded me of the girl I'm dating. I think that has convinced me to stop this rat race of always trying find better, and staying with her."
1,Superficial almost to the point of uselessness,"I bought this book specifically to gain insight into the output I've gotten from using a couple of the data mining algorithms; unfortunately, there's even less on output interpretation than there is in the SQL server help files. Flipping through the book leaves the impression that the authors are trying to be everything to everyone, and end up only scratching the surface except in describing the algorithms.I would have given it a 3 star rating anyway because it is useful to understand how the algorithms work, but went with 1 star to balance out one of the authors giving himself a 5."
2,Different voice?,"Dorothy Gilman is one of my favorite mystery writers. I've read all of her first nine books many, many times, and highly recommend them. In this book and the ones that follow the author's voice shifts so completely, I wonder if she is actually the one continuing to write them. Mrs. Pollifax's character changes, she is ""cross"" several times in the first few chapters and the old Mrs. Pollifax was curious and philosophical and observant. This philosophical bent disappears entirely from these later books.The adventures no longer sizzle along. An early chase in this book is poorly crafted; as it happens it is described without enough detail to make it interesting or suspensful and we are told Mrs. Pollifax looks back on it as a ""nightmare,"" when there is no basis for this in the story. The earlier Mrs. Pollifax would roll with the punches and reserve ""nightmare"" for full fledged torture. These later books are so disappointing because the first nine are so wonderful...."
1,A weak attempt,"The problem is, the best episodes from this series are not included in this set! For whatever reason, several episodes are missing! THEY NEED TO RELEASE THE OTHER EPISODES!"
2,I'm not happy with this purchase,"Yesterday this product arrived to my house and looking the box and discs, it seems that this product is used and I paid for something new. The box of this product is a little bit damage and some discs are a little bit dirty like they have been used before.Please I would like an explanation.Thank you!"
4,A missed opportunity,"I am reliving my childhood and my 5 yo is too. I loved Scooby but hated Scrappy, so I've stopped at this the season 1 & 2 DVD set.This selection really isn't a best of. With Phyllis Diller missing, among others, and some average Harlem Globe Trotter ones, it is a missed opportunity. Why not simply include all of them? Problems with rights? Why aren't we told?! Still worth buying for the fan though."
1,What about the other 9 episodes?,"So far I've been very pleased with the Hanna-Barbera collections, but this is really a poor choice. There were 24 one-hour episodes of ""The New Scooby-Doo Movies"" produced, there are 15 on this set, what about the other 9 episodes? Will there be a second volume? Why didn't they just add a fifth two-sided disc and give us the complete series? BOOOOO!"
4,Best of...?,"Bought this collection for my little boy now that he is becoming interested in cartoons. I grew up on Scooby doo reruns in the 80s and have fond memories of the show, and many episodes are good, but placing several Don Knots episodes on a best of collection seems... stupid. Many good episodes just wish they picked more carefully on several others."
1,Edited and almost complete,"The set has an edited intro, and most of the best episodes are not included because they did not want to buy the rights. This should have been a perfect complete set! Plus, way too much money for what you get."
1,This thing is a ripoff and simplehuman won't back their warranties!,"People! Please think about how much you are spending before you throw your money away on another simplehuman product! How many cheaper items are out there that can do the same thing as this? I bought a number of simplehuman products recently and had trouble with one overpriced piece of junk that I bought, and despite their 5-year warranty, they REFUSED to replace the item even though it was 4 weeks old and barely used. They claimed it was damage caused by the user, but I'm definitely not hard on my belongings and am utterly disgusted with their lack of respect for me as a formerly loyal customer. What a joke this company is..."
5,An excellent tutorial,"Chemistry was never my best subject, especially after high school. I couldn't grasp the concepts. This book defines things well, and the format is straightforward. After finishing this book I was not so confused anymore. There are other books in this same series (like biology, physics, trigonometry, calculus, etc.) all written in this same format. I have checked them out of the local library and recommend any or all of them, especially for home schooling, which I, the quintessential desert rat, am doing with all my kids. This book should be good for anybody who has had trouble with chemistry. It can help you get over the fear."
1,Too many errors,"I made it to page 64 before I returned the book. There are just too many errors. Example 1: p23 477/5 = 70 NOT! Example 2: p43 claims that a periodic table chart is on the inside cover of the book. NOT! Example 3: p48, question 8 the right answer does not appear in any of the choices! Example 4: p64 A Molecule is composed of the same kinds of atoms, chemically bonded. NOT! (what about H20, get rid of the phrase ""the same kinds of atoms"") Example 5: p39, para 3 claims that the number 16, 32, 79!, and 128 are all multiples of the number 16 NOT! Don't buy this one. The writing style is accessible but there are too many errors."
2,Can't believe this book made it to print,"I too was disappointed with this book!I'm currently prepping for a chemistry placement exam and was shocked to find this book so poorly written. I haven't touched chemistry in over eight years but even I knew Gadolinium is Gd, not Ga (which is actually Gallium); that basic math dictates when P1*V1/T1 = P2*V2/T2, solving for V2 yields V2=(P1*V1)T2/(T1*P2) and NOT V1*T1*P1 = V2*T2*P2; and that when an atom is stripped of an electron, a CATION is formed (losing an e- means a POSITIVE charge).Right around Chapter 8's section on Ions and their naming system is when I gave up on this book. Confusing and just as thin as the earlier segments -- which would be fine, except these concepts require WAY more meat to understand than the earlier chapters -- and way more RELIABLE meat. I know this book is just a brush-up, but if they can't explain these ideas simply then they shouldn't have written the book at all!Bad bad bad. Buy something else."
3,Positive Thinking,I saw this book at Glen Ivy and I was hooked. They didn't have any available for purchase but I knew I could count on Amazon to have it. This little book has lots of positive sayings to share with loved ones or at work...which is where I will share it the most.
2,A bunch of positive quotes!,"Not what I expected.On the positive side - it is a small, almost pocket book, nice images and colors!"
5,Small but POWERFUL :),"This book could make a great gift for yourself or people in your life. It is small. It fits in the palm of your hand. However, it is thick and has many positive thoughts, quotes, and affirmations that will surely make your life better. If you are a regular of Self-Help books or are in need of one for the first time, this book makes a great read. It will not disappoint you. It will inspire you, make you smile a little harder, and hopefully make your days a little brighter. :)"
3,Classical music sampler,"Not a bad CD for the price. The disk consists of short, mostly Baroque, selections. I played it as background music when doing my taxes. I don't really get the ""coffee lovers"" in the title--the selections aren't notably peppy or caffeinated!"
2,A young Sheryl Crow?,I bought this album because I liked her version of Underdog Victorious on Mountain Stage in Winter 2005. I was disappointed with the version of Underdog Victorious on this album. Her singing on the Mountain Stage show seemed more energetic and heartfelt whereas this album version seemed flat in comparison. The album in general just sounds like a really young Sheryl Crow.
2,where god was born,"Very much second best to his earlier book, walking the bible. seems like the author thought he had to write another book on the same topic, which is too bad."
5,Praise this welcome perspective on religion,"Feiler is passionate about his own beliefs in his own religion, but never used that as an excuse to beat other readers into following his perspective in this latest work.I admire his articulate and sophisticated critique of religion and the state. Because it is so easy for anybody to become wrapped up in religious extremism while practicing their own perspective, Feiler's work needs to be studied by people of all perspectives seeking a balanced--and thus peaceful alternative to both history and current events."
1,AWFUL,IT WONT LET YOU DO ANYTHING BUT SIT AROUND AND WATCH! IF YOURE LOOKING FOR THE BEST THEN GET NCAA 2K3 OR NFL FEVER! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON ANY MOGUL GAME AT ALL!
1,Tedious,"I will say off the bat that I only read 1/3 of this book. I thought the story sounded great--middle aged widow tries to find a new life for herself, but the author introduced so many characters and all their junk that it took away from the story. I finally just skipped to the end to see if she ever found Cory and how it all turned out. I kept hoping it would get better, but the whole think just gave me a headache with all the side stories on everyone else."
3,A Good Resource,"The most valuable part of this book for me was the information on where to obtain products [on line] to re-create these vintage cocktails. The book could have more recipes and less pictures of ""old cocktail"" shakers and bottles.Still it is worth obtaining."
2,"Some good points, poor writing, suspicious theology","Willard covers many of the essential points in spiritual formation. Unforunately it took a lot of effort to mine the useful ideas in this book. The authors writing style is overly complicated. There is an abundance of irrelevant information. It is a difficult read, and I don't believe it was worth the effort.Williard's theology is suspicious on some points. Williard defines 6 different aspects of the human being. His definitions for 'Spirit' and 'Soul' lack biblical basis. His understanding of Paul's concept of the 'flesh' is weak.The college I work at is using this book as a textbook for a spiritual formation class. This book has received nothing but negative feedback from the students. I don't recommend this book."
3,"dull, Duller, DULLEST...",It is bad enough that Dallas Willard has writen the same book four times. The shame of it all is that they get progressively duller. I believe deeply in a spiritually disciplined life (That is why I've slogged through his books). It is a shame that Willard makes it seem so DULL. He does make good points. Transformation is God's work. The disciplines just help set the table so God can come over and eat with us. Maybe Willard should get one of the Ghost writers the folks at Willow Creek and Jim Cymbala use. It'd make for a much more readable book.
5,"Excellent, Thoughtful Advice","This book is not for people seeking an easy path to enlightenment. Those would be better off reading Deepak Chopra or Caroline Myss. But Mr. Willard's excellent discussion is for those who are sincere about spiritual growth and willing to make the effort to become more Christlike. Mr. Willard has carefully explained all the parts that make up the human being, has explained where the person must concentrate his energies in order to enact spiritual change, and, in the end, he has left it up to the reader to implement a plan for growth. Don't expect the ""Seven Steps to Spiritual Growth."" Do expect to be challenged. And to the extent you can meet the challenges, expect to be rewarded."
1,"Fantastic Movie, BUT Unplayable DVD!","This is one the greatest movies I have ever seen, but my review is about the actual DVD release.I bought this back several years ago and this item did not play on either of my players. I was sent another copy which sadly also did not play. I've tried it on three separate players and each player will not recognise the DVD at all. I contacted the sellers but hear nothing back. I just think others should be aware before buying this product."
3,Mother of 5,My wife loved the locket. The only problem is that we are the parent of 5 wonderful children and the locket was a little hard to close with 5 stones inside.
2,Too small for my needs,"Perhaps I missed read the info on this locket but I will be returning it as it is too small for my needs, it only holds four gem stones. If you have a large family this is not the locket for you but if there are four or fewer children then it will work fine. Inside the package I found the maker of the locket's website to visit. There I found that they do make a larger version of the locket, which holds up to 15 gems, and even suggest that if this one is too small to order the larger one (for $20 more $$) from them. I wish Amazon had also offered the larger one but they don't, not sure why."
2,"Works sometimes, but not worth it","I bought this and installed it on my 2001 BM& 740il...but it didn't work. Dice service was very good, they sent me a replacement even though I did not buy from them, Got it working finally.... but every couple weeks it stops working and I have to work to get the unit to see my ipod. This, combined with ""ok"" but not great sound quality (this may be because I had a digital equalizer that we had to change to analog (another Dice product) made this a lot of work... would have been easier to have burned cd's and changed them occasionally...... just my two cents."
1,Is NOT compatible with new iPhone 4S,"Worked fine with my iPhone 4, but is not compatible with my new iPhone 4S. It will charge it but shows ""DETACHED"".The DICE support department is aware of the problem but no firmware update is available as it is not a ""current"" product like the DUO or MediaBridge."
2,Dream Healer,"A fascinating glimpse of supernormal healing by a remarkable young man who expresses wisdom beyond his years and offers, as a bonus, self-healing advice."
2,Poor quality,"I have the 10th edition of this book. I'm studying it now for the Series 65 and find myself cursing every 3rd page or so. There are multiple typos, grammatical errors, and mis-spelled words. Even worse, a lot of the text doesn't make any sense. A subsequent paragraph often contradicts its predecessor, for example. I'm waiting until I finish it to call Dearborn's ""help line"" with all of my questions. It will probably take an hour to get through all of them. I do not recommend Dearborn's publications."
2,Deceiving Product Title,"I just received this item and realized that only ONE cane came in the box. I went back to check my order and realized that on the product page it says: ""2-count"" but the quantity does not appear anywhere else. I really thought I was getting two canes instead of one.I will keep the product since my grandpa really needs it, but beware of this. I was not."
3,Gary Moore - Story Of The Blues CD single,"1992 Four track CD single from Virgin records with rare tracks, catalog #VSCDT1412.Comes in slimline design jewelcase for CD singles. Different from the DIGIPACK single.Tracklist is:1. Story Of The Blues2. Movin' Down The Road3. King Of The Blues (LIVE)4. Story Of the Blues (LONG VERSION)"
3,Gary Moore - Story Of The Blues - CD single in DIGIPACK,"This is a ""SPECIAL COLLECTOR'S EDITION"" digipack single with 8 page booklet - nice package.Released in 1992 on Virgin records in conjunction with Gary's AFTER HOURS album. Catalog #VSCDG1412.For fans of Gary's blues direction, this stuff is a treat. For old school fans of his rock years, this marks a continuing disappointing trend as Gary seems to have reinvented himself as a blues artist.Tracklist is:1. Story Of The Blues2. Movin' Down The Road3. Midnight Blues (LIVE)4. Story Of The Blues (THE DRY MIX)"
3,Dangerous past.,"Five years earlier, Jane Dolan and her baby daughter, Missy, survived a horrendous accident that wiped her memory clean. Now memories are flooding back after seeing photographs of her murdered mother and sister in the local paper. Reporter Chad Ryker was jilted by Jane's sister, then was contacted by her right before the murder. Chad befriends Jane, eager to find evidence that her brother-in-law is behind the murders.Well constructed mystery, interesting characters and a nice twist at the end enhance the story. However, the romance and chemistry between Jane and Chad is slight. Read this book for the mystery, not the romance."
5,Kurth & Taylor,"I am looking for the first CD, by Kurth & Taylor, released in 1994. It has the song ""Only one I Love,"" on it, and I love that song. I can't find this CD, any where. Does any one have any idea where I could purchase this CD?If so,email me at legaleagle500@yahoo.com"
4,Classic,"This album is certainly worth owning and loving. The only drawback really is that 31 tracks can be a bit much (especially with music this intense). The second half is amazing (and better than the first in terms of song-writing, as well as sound and production) but I think it is worth it to have it all here to see the progression of this band and the obvious influence they have had on hardcore."
5,intense sound,Rorschach is one of the most masterful albums i own. They do an incredible cover of 21st. century schizoid man. These guys are a lot like a metal version of king crimson with screaming vocals and lots of deminished sounding guitars. Their song writing ability is ingenious. If you enjoy metal and something new buy this.
4,Ireland's troubled past,"This is a wonderful book for the novice in Irish history. It's brevity invites the reader to research further on specific items of interest, and includes a list for further reading at the book's conclusion. The information presented is well written and thoroughly presented by six different scholars. Although biases of each scholar are obvious, they do not detract from the historical content."
4,"Great for a beginner (but not ""Complete"")","This book covers all the relevant topics for a beginning Solaris SA, clearly and well organized (vs. other P.Waters books).For the more advanced topics, his Sol 9 Complete book looks good.Unfortunately, in this job market, I don't see much need for a ""beginner Unix SA"", because Sr. SA's (with lots of other exp.) are already a ""dime a dozen""."
4,Great scanner and reasonable price,I have this scanner in my office for a month. It works great and scans both side in second. But sometimes two pages may pass thr the same time so I have to scan it again.Highly recommend for accountant.
4,Great performer,I'm glad that I spent the extra cash for this scanner. It is accurate and fast. I'm shredding lots of old paper files. Any new paper bills or correspondence gets scanned then shredded. No more piles of paper.
1,Buyer Beware,It's great cooking information. But I don't appreciate the business practices of this company and how you end up subscribing to things you don't want. They hijack your credit card. I wish I never bought anything from them; I don't care if their book/website got me cooking like an Iron Chef!
5,Best Cookbook Ever,"My mother and I are fanatic cooks. If it involves anything in the kitchen, we love it!! Between the two of us we also have one of the greatest collections of cookbooks on the planet!! There does seem to be a certain level of one-ups-manship between us. But if it leads to wonderful eating, it's ok!! America's Test Kitchen Cookbook is one of the most fasinating reads we've had in a long time. The Science Desk and Taste Tests have led to many a wonderful debates over the kitchen table. Every recipe we have tried is terrific. We are still debating our favorite."
4,Clinical Application of Mechanical Ventilation,"As a respiratory student, I highly recommend this book for student's and staff alike. The book supplies useful information, and challenging questions in all areas that applies toward patient assessment and care."
3,Loud!!!,Installation for this AC unit is easy. It's a beautiful unit that works great. Very strong cool breeze even at the lowest setting. However!!! This unit is extremely loud. I have been turning the volume on my TV up because I just couldn't hear at the regular volume.
1,Shiver - Sweat Cycles,"I bought this AC because of its power and energy efficiency, but those two qualities are exactly what make me hate it now. When it's on a cooling cycle, it noisily blasts arctic air until it hits the targeted temperature, then it completely shuts off! No fan, no blower, just off. Silence. Until the room warms up and the unit roars back to life. And it is LOUD!I'm not sure what the actual temperature spread is between cycles, but, as this unit is in my bedroom, I spend the night alternately sweating when it's off, and shivering when it's on. Add in the huge noise differential between when it's running and when it's not, and it adds up to a very unpleasant night. I despise this AC."
1,Failed the first time it was used,Maybe you should not use these on a grill but I did and it failed the first time I used it. I even went as far as to insulate the probe cord with aluminum foil and it still died. I would not recommend buying this product. Amazon was very good about a refund.
1,Something wrong,"I have had good luck with Polders in the past, except for the fragility of the probe wires, but the most recent one I purchased is absolutely worthless out of the box. I turned it on, it read 70F, so far so good. I put it in a roast that was just out of the refrigerator, and the temperature climbed above 90F. Huh? So I checked the calibration. Ice water 46F and boiling water 211F. I unplugged and replugged the wire, and tried the roast again. This time, it read 95F. I checked with a Thermapen, and it was 57F.So, if you want an upredictable, unreliable thermometer, you might consider this one. There are no instructions for the user to adjust calibration. Also, they don't accept returns unless purchased from the Polder website."
1,Utter Trash,"This book is akin to WWII Nazi Youth propaganda.""Hey kids, tell your parents how great clearcutting is! Pay no attention to the science, just believe us and our pro-logging-screw-everything-else ""experts"", we know what's best"". For this thing top be put out in this day and age when we know so much about the impact of clearcutting is outrageous!"
4,Very useful S/W for small business use,This S/W is a very useful tool for a small business and home.
2,Not like the other guerrilla books.,"Too much fluff, not enought stuff. The Guerrilla Marketing Series of books is renown for their delivering tactic after tactic, idea after idea, story after story. This book falls short on that order.The book is subtitled ""Mastering the Art of Effective and Winning Business Presentation"" yet primarly discusses presentations from a scholerly debate point of view. It's like a professor, who's never had to do a guerrilla thing in their life decided to add the word, guerrilla to their thesis.Your better off getting Don Aslet's ""Is there a speech in you?"""
2,Off the wall comedy,There are some good parts to the movie. Roy Dupuis is the good parts. Strange story set in 1920's Arizona with all characters speak French??????
1,False advertiser. You will receive the older version.,"I ordered the ""Third edition (March 26, 2012)"". I was given the 2003 edition which is totally useless to me since the information is almost 10 (ten) years old."
4,Pixinguinha/Paulo Moura,"Pixinguinha was the stage name of Alfredo Da Rocha Viana Filho (1879-1973), a composer, arranger and performer who was considered Brazil's greatest composer of ""choros"" the popular Brazilian street music. He composed most of his best-known tunes in the 1920s and '30s.This recording is a live concert devoted to the music of Pixinguinha performed by clarinetist Paulo Moura and an octet called Os Batutas, which is pretty hot--Moura is a terrific technician and they play some of these pieces faster than you'll ever hear anywhere. One could sometimes wish that Moura paid maybe a little more attention to intonation, or at least played on a reed that was less than 20 years old, but it's clear that everybody's having a good time."
4,Stay Cool this summer.,This is a great unit for the price. Great features include sleep and timer modes and an air filter. The one down side is that the unit is a tad on the noisy side.
4,Reef One biOrb Aquarium Service Kit (6 Pack),"The kit is easy to use, although I completely emptied the tank because there had been no fish in it for about a year. The only draw back is that you can only buy it in 6 packs. I would like to be able to purchase them as I need them in single units."
5,A holiday charmer for all ages!,"Moe Price's simple but effective humor is the perfect tone for this tongue-in-cheek telling of Santa's first sleigh and the search for the proper ""livestock"" to pull it. Morozumi's illustrations lend a lovely holiday atmosphere without gooey sugar coating to glop up this funny Christmas ""tail."""
5,"Warm, funny at times, superb reading.","This is a fabulous story of a family growing old together. It includes all of the family secrets, all of the rough times, all of the good times, and a growing hatred between two sisters that will touch your heart. There is treachery of the worst kind, and love of the best kind. There is a kind father, a bitter mother, confused children, and an ending that will leave you very glad you invested your time in reading this book. Martha Claire is a character you will love and adore, and then resent, and finally despise, a trick I have yet to see any other author pull off so beautifully. The children will touch your heart, and a man named Grayson is one you will not soon forget. READ THIS BOOK!"
1,Don't buy this saw,"I bought this saw on the Milwaukee name. I have owned 5 wormdrive saws by Skillsaw brand name. If I didn't pay so much for this saw I would throw it out. Both handles, guard, and height adjustment do not even come close to the Skill saw. The table is thiner than Skills,it bends very easy. The top handle is I beam shape not round, Hold on to that handle for a day. The guard lever is very thin, if you lay it on the guard lever it will bend. The height adjustment is also about 1/2 the thickness of Skills and it sticks and can be very hard to adjust. Don't buy it! Buy a Skillsaw brand worm drive saw."
1,Cheap product,This is a very cheap product and the manufacturer is even worse. I went though two of these in four months. PCUsa manufacturer's support is not good. I do not recommend. Luckily it did not damage my iPod Touch.
3,House of Rain,"This narrative would be much clearer if there were a map(s) of the author's journey; and perhaps a few clear, not fuzzy, photos of the pottery types that illustrate many aspects of his thesis."
1,If it would run I might use it.,"I bought the previous version of this software sometime in 2002 only to find that it didn't run on Windows 2000. I ran it on Windows 98 only to find that if you entered any dates above the year 2000 that it would crash.So onto the current version, well it still doesn't run under windows 2000. I reported the problem to Kiplinger and they said ask for a refund.I'll be looking for my refund, I would suggest that you don't buy it in the first place.As a side note the included manual/leaflet tells you to visit www.....com to register your product and for support, unfortunately that isn't their website.If you are curious as to what it does on windows 2000 here are the details. The program starts but never shows a window. If you look on the processes in task manager you will find willpower.exe running, in fact if you start the program many times you will find many of them there. So without a window showing you can't use it."
2,Slow on the Computer & Even Slower Support,"It does slow up the computer even in the low priority mode. Their support people I do not think exist as I have written twice with no response. I know it is a ""cheap"" program but when they offer support I expect them to give it."
2,"good scan, bad running program","In my experience, SpySweeper is very high in the ranks of locating spyware. PestPatrol, SpyBot, and AdAware are always going to each find spyware that the others won't, due to different definition lists, probably, and what each company thinks is a threat (i.e. PP wants you to have no filesharing software nor any wild tangent software). SpySweeper is a good choice if you were to purchase just one, in my opinion. The shields are really great, especially the ones added in version 3.0, HOWEVER!!! in my experience, having SpySweeper running on my computer is proving to be very harmful. In an idle state (no internet browsers open either) it uses 100MB OR MORE of my ram, which is strange, so it could be a problem just with my setup or installation or something. I recommend the software, but think twice before you use the shields, possibly look into some other realtime autoprotect."
5,Serious look at diet,My wife is serious follower of eating for your blood type. It does work for serious dieters. I think we have purchased copies for all our friends and family.
4,very handy!,"I keep this slim little book in my purse; There's enough space in the pages' layout to write little notes- which I plan to do as I find changes in the lists online. After I while, I think you wind up memorizing the un/acceptable items.The only reason I gave this four stars is, I wish there was a section listing the many ""hidden ingredients"" out there. There are so many additives made from corn, wheat, potatoes, etc. It's challenging avoiding and finding substitutes for the less-obvious no-nos out there.Don't let this caveat keep you from buying the book, I just wish they would add that one more section, perhaps in an updated edition.cheers,Kathleen"
1,Don't Buy It,"If you have already purchased the book ""Eat Right 4 Your Type"" you won't need this supplement as all the info is right there."
1,Very disappointed,"I heard about this book from a collegue of mine and couldn't wait to absorb what ""eating right for my blood type"" was all about. Unfortunately, I was just sick when I saw the condition the book was delivered in! If this source reports their products are in 'good' condition, I'd hate to see 'fair' or 'poor'!! I will never purchase from this site again! Barnes & Noble, you have a returning customer! For the price I paid, along with shipping and handeling, I could have gotten 2 books! Very disappointed!"
2,Not Too Profound,"I did not have a profound experience utilizing this booklet and gave the booklet away after reading it. It's a skinny little booklet with a little information. In hindsight, I do not recommend this booklet. My recommendation is for the Atkin's book, New Diet Revolution, a great resource for eating healthy and is loaded with good practical information."
3,it's ok,"I am not happy buying online anymore. The reason I buy on line is to avoid the hassle of having to get into my car, drive to the store, look around for parking, risk getting a ticket, wasting time in a long line and having to deal with peoples attitudes. No thanks, no more shopping online for me. UPS doesn't want to do their job, they never ring the bell. Then you go downsatirs to find out they left you a paper with instruction to go pick it up at the post office, becuase supposely there was no-one to answer the door, when in reality they never rang the bell. Plus the book is not as good as I thought."
4,_A great read!,Jayne Ann Krentz is an awesome writer. Everything she does is a pleasure to read. This was a totally enjoyable book. I highly recommend it.
1,Pick another Krentz book - it's bound to be better,"I love Jayne Ann Krentz, and I have read the majority of her books, and this was one of her few disappointments. The characters are annoying, irritating, one-dimensional and there is NO chemistry between the two to speak of. In addition, the male character's constant threats of violence are NOT sexy nor do they add much to the plot. In addition, every other sentence ends with an exclamation point, which I think is supposed to signal emotion, but that's about the only way one would sense emotion in this lackluster story. My advice, don't buy this novel - move on to one of her Amanda Quick or Arcane Society books. Her newer novels have much deeper characters in general."
2,Outdated and not her best work,"I had thought I had read just about everything Jayne Ann Krenz in print so when this one popped up on the Kindle list I picked it up. Big mistake. The language was choppy. I believe she wrote originally for the Harlequin romances and I suspect that this was one of them that was re-released due to her current popularity. The copyright date on it was much earlier than the 2004 that the release date is showing. The ""strong and masterful man"" in this work to me is essentially a control freak is not my cup of tea and I don't think any sane woman would tolerate it. If you are a fan of her current work as I am, I seriously doubt you'll enjoy this one."
2,so LOUD!,"It gets really cold yes. Its really loud though! I bought it for the bedroom, but couldn't take the noise. I put it out in the living room but have to turn the Tv up really loud to hear it. Its annoying. Just bought a sharp Model: AFQ80RX Purrs quiet like a kitten![...]"
4,Frigidaire FAC124P1A,"We are cooling about 600 sq.ft with this unit, and it does it very well. The packaging of this unit is downright ingenious! Very easy to open, not a ton of card board to recycle ands easy to remove. The unit is light enough for a 60 year old guy with a sore back to lift. Other reviewers have written about how noisy this is, and I found they had not exaggerated! To my ears it is not a very disturbing noise, but we do have to turn up the TV a notch!"
4,Very satisfying listening experience,"This album was reportedly released without the knowledge of Charlie Thomas - and that may explain the unusual sound balance - rhythm guitar up front, drums muted. But that brings out the voices and what great voices - the pre-Charlie Thomas Drifter's era ""The Bells Of St. Marys"" Marys"" is beyond an album highlught, but a true time-capsule entry. Thomas' warbling on thuis lesser-known nugget is...some kinda wonderful.Some oldies done at a fast pace, sounding very programmed for the Cabaret circuit; one song, ""When My Little Girl Is Smiling"", a beat ballad better left on the shelf, is okay, but what about ""Adorable""? jk.Also is alot of stage banter, which may seem a bit out of place at Harvard University...but with all due respect, that's a plus!"
3,whatever!!!,"if you're thinking about buying this for a Dimage X20, which I didn't think was too different from the other Dimage Xseries cameras, DON'T!!! it's a tight fit and the you can only fit one other AA battery in with the case. there is no way you can have 2 extra batteries and a spare card along with the camera and still get the case to close! other than that, it's great just for batteries and spare cards."
3,Get noticed with this alert,"I bought this deer alert for my motorcycle, we ride alot of forested asphalt and dirt roads in the western us. 2 yrs ago I hit a deer with my bike , so i was looking for a deterent of hitting deer again. I settled on this alert because it makes noise at any speed and you can tell if it is working. just got back from riding one week in N Calif and noticed deer along the road and back in the fields perk up and watch me as i went by,the other bikes in the group recieved no such special attention, other animals also seem to notice and flee. the sound the device makes resembles a wounded creature of somekind. I basically think the device gets the animal to notice you and watch opposed to not noticing you and just running where ever they may please and in your path. Glad I now own one."
5,Great for class assignments,"These items were purchased for a biology class in a junior high school. Our employer had a ""Back to School"" Donation Drive and they were requested by the classroom teacher. We received them in plenty of time. The teachers are very happy with them!"
5,So nice to make love to....,"I first heard a ""Somethin' Bout Love"" on the radio and had to have it. Then I heard the entire CD and it blew me away with its smooth, sexy feel. This CD is THE one to play next time you are spending an intimate evening with the one you love....thank you Brian for giving us this sensual set."
4,"CD IS GOOD. ONE OF THE BETTER ONE'S ON THE MARKET, BUT.....","BRIAN CULBERSON IS STILL ONE OF THE BEST BUYS OF THE YEAR BUT LACKS THAT PUNCH THAT MADE HIM WORLD RENOWN, THAT HE SO POSSESSED ON 'SECRETS'. THIS CD IS NOT A STEP ABOVE. IT IS ,IN MY OPINION, A STEP TO THE SIDE AND BACK A BIT. STILL A GOOD BUY THOUGH!!!!"
3,It works...,"After using it a few times, the design could use some improvement. Overall, it works but not in as many applications as I had hoped for."
2,Make sure your expectations are right,"Yes, this is a super low budget comic horror flick. Normally, I love low budget horror, especially horror with a comic component to it. But I'm not a fan of slapstick, and frankly, I hate it. This movie is slapstick, so draw your own conclusions on my view. The sad thing is if it werent for the slapstick, it could have been appealing to me. However, there were far too many characters trying to duplicate Rodney Dangerfield with ridiculous dialog and annoyingly affected voices. Some people enjoy very over the top type humor, and they might really enjoy this movie. So my suggestion is to understand that generally binary consideration - if you like slapstick and low budget, this is your movie. If not, there are far better options for spending your time."
4,"Milwaukee, there is no substitute.","Milwaukee invented the sawzall, and in my opinion, they still produce a superior product. The blade changes quickly, and the tool itself seems much more durable than other brands. The drill is excellent. The battery can be inserted so as to allow the tool to stand up on its own, or the otherway to allow for tighter spaces.Battery life is better than average, and this screw gun/hammer drill complements the Magnum Drill nicely.A great set."
4,Trinity Blood Delivers,Saw this series late night on Comedy Central a few years back. Was overjoyed to be able to purchase it on Amazon for such a reasonable price at the time of my own choosing. Extremely pleased with my purchase.
3,So-so...,"Well, I've finally seen Trinity Blood and I have to agree with most of the professional critics...it's no masterpiece. It's fun though, even with its flaws: The story is full of emotional twists and turns, some of which make sense and some of which will leave you scratching your head. In either case, the depiction of these suffers from a complete lack of subtlety. This anime is just too wildly overdramatic for its own good--many of its intended touching moments just inspire eye-rolling or even laughter. Don't even get me started on the series' ending...just pure craziness. These things said, the production is pristine, with lush backgrounds and lovely character designs and if you take this anime with a pinch (or perhaps a big, heaping bowl) of salt, you'll have a good time."
4,Great but could be excellent!,"Ok well it seems that everyone loved this book. This is an excellent basics approach to the kidney topic. It has excellent clinical applications for hyper/hypo kal and natrimia. It also has a great section on approaching acid-base problems in a 3 step system. This was a wonderful inclusion. The one problem for those wanting to know about physiology, this book doesn't contain it! NOTHING on clearance, GFR, or Renal blood flow! If it had this it would be a 5 star. It is a complete power house if you buy it and Lippencott's physiology board review."
5,"Very Good, whether your a beginner or not...","Although I prefer Dr. Cooper's first book, ""Aerobics"" this book is also well written, easy to understand, and conveys the importance of aerobic (principly in the form of jogging/running) as presented by the author.Written 14 years after the original ""Aerobics"", Dr. Cooper has continued to evolve his principles about aerobic conditioning in this bookIn this book Cooper also presents his thoughts on what constitutes productive and effective exercise as opposed to ineffective exercise and exercising to the point of over training.I recommend this book to people who are new to exercise or people who are just starting out."
2,Out Dated,"Overall, Cooper's book on Aerobic Fitness has some excellent info on beginning a fitness program if you are a beginner to exercising. However, a lot of the information that has been compiled is out of date from the late 1970's and early 1980's. Do not use this book if you are designing your own Exercise Program. Do more research on the internet by simply using the search word ""exercise""; you will have a wealth of current knowledge and numerous references to review. Do not start an exercise program without first consulting with your doctor."
2,A saddlemaker's comments,"From the saddlemaker's perspective, this book omits more than it includes. Saddlemaking is a very visual art form, and this book barely includes enough B & W photos to give the reader more than a skimpy overview of how a traditional saddle is made. It is DEFINATELY not a how-to book on making a saddle despite its title. Considering there are literally hunderds of saddle tree styles, the small scale ""patterns"" in the book are of no use. The style saddle shown in the book is not a style saddle that one would find in today's American riding arena, thus dating the book's photos three or four decades previous to its publication date. If the casual observer wants to look at a few pictures of some of the insides of an older style English saddle, then this booklet may serve as a five minute browse."
4,Mystery,"this is an excellent and riveting tale of the depressing lives of the author's mother and grandparents. But, at the end it is akin to turning the last page of an Agatha Christie and reading ""and thus the identity of the murderer remains a mystery"". The fundamental questions raised in the first pages are never resolved."
1,Sent it back right away!,"I ordered this item, I made a mistake! It didn't have a built in screen protector. It was hard to fit the Motorola Q in, which does not mean that it is good because it is a tight fit. It meant that the built in openings for the camera, charger etc... easily became partially covered b/c it didn't fit in well. Also, there is no covering for the top of your phone. IT was a completly worthless case for me."
3,Take a romp through New Mexico with quirky characters.,"Merilee Levitay heads to New Mexico to reunite withher lover, Larry Johnston who has enlisted in theArmy. Along the way (Merilee we roll along?) shepicks up a hitchhiking dwarf named Enoch Swann.Introducing more zaniness to the plot is ahypochonrical insurance claims adjuster namedFigman. Convinced he is dying, Figman sets out torealize his potential as an artist. Enter two morecharacters named Oma and Verdie and the fun begins asAlpert sets a series of comical scenes. It's interestingto note that writer Alpert is a former theater teacherand stage director. It would be fun to see how thewriter would stage and direct her company of quirkycharacers for comic delight. Merilee's trip to Larryactually drives her away from him. She and Figman bothdiscover that true love can be found in very peculiar places."
4,A charming and very amusing nostalgia-trip,"I bought this book on a whim, without knowing much about Watkins or his novels. I ended enjoying the book a great deal. It is difficult to write memoirs that steer away from off-putting pretension while being interesting and humorous, but Watkins has done just that. He succeeds largely by making the book more about his perception of his surroundings than about himself. But I am afraid the book is bound to have a somewhat limited appeal. At the very end Watkins tries to give the nostalgia for his schooldays existential meaning, but he is forced to admit he does not quite know how to go about that. Yet the story as a whole is very enjoyable, and we shouldn't demand that every book be an epiphany."
3,What's all the fuss about?,"I think one of the reasons the graphcs are so blasé in this game is the fact that it is so old and just now getting ported to OS X, you know, the *other* operating system that so many of us enjoy working with daily. It's like giving breadcrumbs to a starving man. The man is eternally grateful just to get something of immeasurable worth that he is willing to overlook the obvious shortcomings.It's still just a breadcrumb. Not a meal, or even a snack. NOLF is like that. An FPS that wants to convince Mac users they're really getting a fabulous dinner with all the fixings.With that said, the scene cutaways are campy, cute, and LONG. And no way to bypass them to get into playing the game. It's not groundbreaking entertainment; for that, I'd recommend Red Faction. Now there's a fun FPS. Enjoy. But don't take it too seriously. This is just the breadcrumbs of what a really great game could be. And without any of the fixings, either!"
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Silence Leigh is a female starship pilot. There are not too many of these around. The different thing about these books is that pilots fly ships not via any particular sort of technology, but more an ability to interact with reality, a little like the Amberites, to change the dimensions around them so that they get to where they want to go.Silence here is basically taken prisoner by two men, and forced to use her abilities to serve them, as a way out of her economic problems.The Hegemony treats women poorly, and she is cheated out of a rightful inheritance, but a marriage of convenience with these men enables them to continue on their way. She finds out they are in an underground movement devoted to working about the Hegemony.Thus begins a larger conflict."
3,"Interesting subject, but annoying writing style","I found myself cringing everytime Charles Cullen's name was mentioned in this book because just about every mention of his name is prefaced by a superfluous adjective... (i.e. the killer nurse with the sickly pallor...the homicidal RN, the ghostly death shadow....and the list goes on). At times, I felt like I was reading a badly written hospital thriller. I did, however, appreciate that the victims were personalized and not referred to as a victime number. The book is a bit drawn out and tedious, but overall it's an average to decent true crime read."
3,From a fellow nurse,"Yep...I am a nurse. And at one time I reported a nurse I thought was doing very similar misdeeds (but they never proved it.) So heck yeah I wanted to read this book. While the subject interests me, I have a hard time getting around the writting. The authors paraphrase previous paragraphs frequently..unbelievably redundant. The time lines are all screwy - jumping around is so confusing and they often leave off years in their dates. They had one man dieing in 1996 but said he was widowed in 1997. How did THAT work? And if I heard about Charles size, pallor or stone facial expressions one more time I was going to flip. This book felt like a much shorter book that was stretched to fill pages. That makes no sense since so much happened - so many murders. There was plenty of filling available -the authors just didn't bother. I would skip this one unless you have some personal interest."
2,it is only so so :(-,I've found the thongs too be quite narrow though it was medium but the size is right. I am not a thong person but based on the reviews I decided to give it a try. It was not as comfortable as I would like. I am not impressed with the style either. I did not know what exactly the color teal is. It turned out to be more turquoise than blue. The quality is not as good as other pairs of Clarks shoes that I've owned.
5,"Practical, Informative Resource for Parents and Educators","This book helps shed light on an area where there is not a lot of information available.Parents of children with selective mutism, along with educators, will find Helping Your Child with Selective Mutism: Steps to Overcome a Fear of Speaking, a useful resource, providing both information and a practical approach to assisting the child.The recommended actions are clearly spelled out. While focusing primarily on working with children who experience selective mutism in the school setting, the strategies suggested in the book are applicable across a variety of settings.As a special educator, I would recommend this book to parents and teachers who would like to learn more about selective mutism and actions to be taken to assist the child."
5,A sad and shocking tale,"I read this book for the first time about 5 years ago and it still haunts me. I have also read Aprodite Jones' version and it was very disappoiting. Where Jones ' main focus was sensationalism and lesbian teens with knives, ""...Angel"" told this heartwrenching true tale with feeling and dignity, and with Shanda's familys' input. This sad, shocking tale proves that truth really is stranger than fiction. And much, much sadder."
5,The most intense and frightening book I have ever read,"I too am a lesbian, and jealousy sometimes is very overwhelming. For someone to kill over something so minor is insane. I will remember this book forever and it will make me wonder how people can be so cruel. These women deserve the death penalty. I can't believe they would ever consider letting these women out EVER!!!!"
1,Umm.. Problem with the review below....,"The reviewer below was talking about the PC version of the AVP2. The other reviewers who gave one star for the game are talking about the Mac version. The minimum video card requirement is 32MB for mac. You really need 512MB video card to make this game run smoothly. This is the worst ported game I've ever played. I'm running a dual G5 and it glitches, chops and crashes all the time. Its been over 8 months since Macplay and The Omni Group have known about the multiplayer problem with Mac OS 10.3 and they have done nothing about it. The people at The Omni Group and Macplay should be arrested for taking people's money for an incomplete, unplayable game. Seriously..."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!,"I don't profess to be anything close to a 'Video Game Guru"", but I have never, ever played a more aggrevating, inept, poorly made video game in my life!! I have heard that the first AVP game was very good. This version is very bad. From what I have heard so far, unless you have a computer system that rivals the United States Department of Defense, forget about playing this game on anything else.This lousy game is FULL of mistakes, and don't even bother to contact the so called ""support group"" at MacPlay. They are in complete denial over this crappy thing.Mac Play should be ASHAMED of this piss poor effort!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!"
1,Windows Version is Great! Mac Version is terrible.,"Ok... Both the Windows and the Mac version are the same game, one catch though. The Mac version was ported (converted) from the Windows version. The conversion is terrible. The Mac game is CHOPPY, SLOW, UNPLAYABLE on even the fastest computers. The Omni Group did slip-shoddy, piss poor job at porting this game to the Mac platform. Go get the Windows version of this game on Amazon or www.aliensvspredator2.com and play it on your friends PC."
3,Doesn't work on Leopard!,"This is a cool game, but if you've got Leopard, it won't work. Furthermore, MacPlay, if you contact them for support, will send you a lame auto-reply ""Out of office"" e-mail saying, ""We are aware that there are issues regarding many titles not functioning correctly in the Leopard operating system. Unfortunately at this time, we are unable to provide support on any of our MacPlay titles."" If that's not the lamest excuse I've ever heard...On the bright side, Aliens vs. Predator 1 does work! Go figure..."
2,Divorce for man,There is not much in this book for a man to do in the divorce case.Men are always loser in a divorce. I found no help in this book.
2,Marginaly useful,"Not horrid but without theAll in One Clamp #WJ Wide Jaws Fixture for All in One Clamp (2-Pack)for another $17 per clamp, the clamp faces are too narrow to make contact with anything but flat boards. The T track is of no use as its a peculiar size so they get to sell more accessories. They do work OK as a straight edge but not nearly as good as the Bora 540950 50 Inch Aluminum Guide Clamp Edge, they make a bunch of sizes. I thought I was getting a good deal from Rockler on a blow out of 24"", 36"" and 50"". Turns out to not be a good deal after all. I see now why they are getting rid of them cheap.BTW I thought that the marking tape was a good idea--NOT! It is hard to align accurately and even that is dubious. Maybe OK for rough framing but not otherwise."
1,Bad Quality,"I own the 50"" version of this clamp. I returned this clamp because I received a used one. At that the clamp did not tighten up. The guide edge had imperfections and was not TRUE."
4,Fantastic addition!,"I just got this book and read through it, and I have to say I am very pleased! I haven't made anything from it yet, but the instructions are very clear. The only things I disliked were the clothes they made for the model in the pictures are hideous, also I didn't see any drawings or instructions for working on the BACK of a bodice. The drawings are very good. I love that it comes with quarter-sized pattern peices in the back which you can size up and adjust to fit you if you decide not to make your own from the step by step guide to a basic bodice she gives you."
3,Helpful but lacking,"Was happy with the book was detailed how to make a dress pattern, which I want to learn how to make patterns by constructing not by my mannequin which Ive been doing.The thing that bothered me a lot that when it came to other patterns, it says COPY THEM, by the rubbing off technique, already know how to do that, thats not making your own constructed designs, so that really annoyed me............."
4,great,The book was in great shape and arrived as expected. I am looking forward to reading it!From my hasty scan it appears to be full of good info.
2,Not worth the money,Poor make and description does not state that the bowls are not microwave safe. Don't waste your time or your money.
1,Look for something else...,"OK, the guy can write clear English sentences, but:The characters are insipid and unsympathetic. The plot is underwhelming, trite, often predictable. The dialogue made me wince. The story is quite dated given the current state of US-Vietnam relations (though the novelist can hardly be blamed for that). Nonethelss, I did finish it... I say, look for something else."
4,Stroller shade is excellent!,"This is great, it made a huge difference when we were on vacation. No more readjusting an unwieldy umbrella or covering the baby with a sheet. It covers all the way to his toes. I wish strollers came with better shades themselves. Not 5 stars only because the velcro straps are not the best attachments but they do work pretty well."
3,Does the job.,"There isn't much selection when it comes to choosing an extended shade for your stroller.This shade is made of what I would describe as women's swimsuit material. There is the potential for it to be too flimsy in the wind as other comments have noted, but so far I have not been in that situation. The velcro tends to snag the shade material, damaging it.Easy to put on and off, although you can't fold your stroller with it on. Can somewhat be extended to varying degrees but not as nicely as the photo shows.Overall, does the job. Nothing fancy."
3,Ok to use some conditions,"This is generally a OK product. So far I used it for a couple of month, the stripe to tie the shade to the stroller is tearing off already. Also when you stretch it down all the way, it will get stuffy inside the stroller. I thought you could attatch this to any stroller, turned out you can only attatch it to a stroller with it's own shade already. otherwise there is no supporting point for this shade."
4,Excellent book for those who are larger,"and for those who love larger people. This book is cutting edge and I'm certain will cause a stir from people who preach that ""thin is the only sexy"" but guess what, most people don't look like models or movie stars so this is really a book for the majority of Americans. There are six chapter which cover everything from personal identity issues, dating, community groups, health, and sexual suggestions for a more fulfilling intimate life. I have two complaints about this book (thus the 4 stars instead of 5): facts without citation (yup, I know she did a survey but still there are facts tossed about that need evidence) and a jumping around between ""fat people"" and ""fat admirers"" that can make things a bit confusing. It could also really use some diagrams for some of the positions she discusses in chapter six -- if we can't assume that the existing sexuality books address ""fat"" needs, how can we assume that larger people know what a certain position looks like?"
1,Roxanne,"Well what can I say. First it was in spanish. I speak english only so I had to read the film. I was very disappointed with this film. The movie was slow moving to where after so much of it I ended up fast forwarding small pieces at a time. Plus the movie was extremely boring. I had a hard time trying to finish this movie. If this movie would have sold for a penny I would NOT have purchased it had I of known what I now know about this movie. The only thing I can say is it was slow, boring, not scary at all, and in spanish. I do not recommend this movie. But going by all the viewers who actually somehow enjoyed this movie and rated it a 4 and 5 star movie is another one of history's mysteries. I guess im left to say, ""each to their own""."
1,CAUTION: SPANISH WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES!,Oops! It in SPANISH with english subtitles. Something I missed in all the hype.
4,Blu ray specs and features below,"This is just a heads up on the release of the film rather than a review, which I'll do later. I wanted to know when this was coming out seeing I missed it in theaters thought I'd pass along what info I found via blu ray's website and movieweb.Blu raySound and picture specsVideo will be presented in 2.35:1 1080p accompanied by a 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio Spanish soundtrackDvd Special featuresSpecial Features- When Laura Grew Up: Constucting The Orphanage featurette- Horror In The Unknown: Makeup Effects featurette- Tomas' Secret Room featurette- Still gallerypresented in Spanish with English subtitles (similar to how 'Pan's Labyrinth', a film directed by Del Toro, was released).One reviewer compared this to The Changeling which is one of the greatest ghost stories in my opinion as well.Guillermo Del Toro who produced this film mentions his top 5 ghost story films on ew's website and listed The Changeling, perhaps it did have an influence."
3,Every Cliche in the Book!,"The cinematography and acting were first rate, but the director used every ""scary movie"" cliche in the book to turn ""The Orphanage"" into a standard frightfest. While it's difficult to fault a genre movie for adhering to its genre boundaries, there just isn't anything here that you haven't seen before. If you're looking for a haunted house tale that strays a little bit from the tried and true, I would recommend rentingThe Others (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)instead."
4,Great film,"I use this for my Spanish students. It's scary enough to hold the attention of teenagers but not so scary that I can't handle it. It's not disgusting horror, just suspenseful."
3,Promising at first - but didn't quite deliver,"I really enjoy suspenseful, scary movies. This one seemed pretty promising, but it just didn't make it for me. I didn't so much mind the subtitles, but I couldn't really figure out why it was rated R. It deserved a PG-13 rating. There were parts that were a little creepy, but it ended in a very flat, bland way. Overall, I don't think i would recommend this movie."
1,The Orphange,"There should be a warning on the front of the DVD case that this movie is only available in Spanish... how can anyone enjoy a horror movie that they have to read through everything, I shut the movie off half way through and returned it to the store for a refund."
2,Picture quality marred by white specks/spots,"Interesting film but not as good as FRAGILE or THE OTHERS. It feels a bit derivative of the previous spanish horror films.The picture quality could have been superb, but because of the laziness of today's video divisions of the studios, they neglected to remove or mask the running white spots that ruin the picture.What is the purpose of blu ray with its amazing depth and color and resolution when all these white spots ruin the image. It is more than just an irritation or annoyance. Can Blu ray deliver on a pristine image, especially for modern films? Afraid not."
5,Unpredictable and full of suspense!,"First of all, the blu-ray sound and picture quality is top notch - everything from the doors creaking to the rain hitting the ground. The visuals are spectacular too. Guillermo Del Toro did a fantastic job producing this movie. I'm sure he had a big influence in the visual effects as well.The Orphanage takes place in the present time and deals with current issues but because the setting is an old house it has a classic feel to it. Its really suspenseful and involves paranormal activity.If you enjoyed Pan's Labyrinth and The Others, you'll definitely enjoy this movie. I regret not seeing this in theaters, its actually become one of my new favorite movies! Check it out!!"
5,SPANISH DIALOG - but still a masterpiece!!! NO SPOILERS,"I didn't see it mentioned right away, but this is a Spanish Dialog movie. Still, it's one of the best Ghost Stories I have seen in years. Very well written, acted, and filmed - 100% satisfaction. It's a very carefully woven story with a lot of details, so if you are looking for a slasher/Freddy/Bloody/Jason movie, this is not it. It did have one of THE most disturbing things I have ever seen in a horror movie, but I'll let you see for yourself!"
3,Moody but light on scares,"I've heard quite a few raves for ""The Orphanage"". I really liked the great set and wonderful less-is-more atmosphere presented in this film. I always appreciate the ability to tell a scary story without excessive gore. But after watching this twice, it doesn't stand up to other recent spooky treats like ""The Others"" or ""The Sixth Sense"" or even other Guillermo Del Toro related projects like ""The Devil's Backbone"". Perhaps I needed more involvement from Carlos (the father) or maybe a better child actor than the boy who played Simon.The movie was certainly slow-moving but that is normally something that I have plenty of patience for. I can recommend ""The Orphanage"" for it's cinematography but not really on its characters or storytelling."
5,ORFANATO,"I was surprised when I watched this movie at the theater,cause I was expecting another spanish trash. No offense ,but I don't like most of the spanish movies cause they are kinda lame. But the Orphanage just break the mold. I loved the movie it was different than what I was expecting.I usually say after watching a spanish movie, ""an american version would've been much better"", but this one & no exception all it's excellent the way it is & the way it was directed."
2,Broke,"I wish I could have recieved one of these clamps that would work, the clamping end shown in the picture was broke and won't work so all it is good for is a straight edge and nothing else. they where all out of stock at the time and was never contacted for another purchase when stock was replenished. I offered to return it but they told me to keep it. Like I said it can be used as a straight edge for marking but will not clamp!"
1,hard to use; does it work??? not by my experience,"at first i was disappointed in the flimsy nature of the product. i figured it should be intuitive and easy to use. not so. it seemed the product was broken as it would not work. so i had to make a long distance call at my expense. there after three attempts, someone told me they had a problem with the product they had not anticipated. they were correcting it by including instructions. so the person told me the 'secret' of how to make this foolish thing work. i followed the cumbersome instructions and got it to -just sort of work. but it is a very awkard procedure and even then sometimes it does work and then again it will just not. this item sure is not worth the money, not worth the hassle, and not worth having to make a toll call. all it is good for i think is as a straight edge...foregoing any plans to have it clamp easily to wood and guide a saw. never would i have bought this ahd i seen it beforehand."
3,An ok clamp.,This is an ok clamp but its tough for me to get used to working the under lever for adjusting the width of material that you work on. I don't use it much anymore for that reason but when I take my time it is nice for ripping plywood sheets down with a straight line.Pat
5,Great Historical read.,If you wanted to learn more about Japanese country food this is the book for you. The first part of the book talks about the history and the second half has some excellent receipts.
4,"Good Shirt, For Work OR Play","I bought one of these shirts from a local retailer awhile ago, and found it great for those cool days with an unlined denim jacket over it. It fits me well and has a stylish appearance. All that, plus the durability of a work shirt. I went back to buy one or two more, but found that that same retailer didn't have them anymore. Many local work clothes stores either didn't have them anymore or never carried them. An Internet search came up with some on-line retailers, but with limited colors and sizes. Amazon had access to what I wanted. I recommend this shirt certainly for work, but keep one or two available in your closet for those weekend days with the kids or doing those weekend errands."
3,An Intelligent Look At Something Undeserving Of An Intelligent Look,This book you hold in your handIs the work of a not too sane manWhose writing of oldBecame covered with moldThat no one could love or understand
3,my mango pits must be big,The opening for the splitter is just a little too small for most of my mangoes. It works but the mango is just a little more fiberous than I like to eat. And for smoothies I'm fishing bits out that wouldn't puree....
5,A great gadget!,"This is a terrific tool for anyone who enjoys mangos. It definitely works as well as claimed, which, unlike too many other tools, makes it well worth buying."
3,great when everything is right,"This is a real timesaver for folks who do a lot of mangos. My only complaint is the mango must fit the slicers deminsions. The seed can't be too big (no way to know in advance) and the mango can't be overly ripe or the presure will smash the bottom and put juice everywhere.Very minor nitpiks, but buyers should consider them."
1,"No Bingo Bango, No Mango Bango, Will Not Work for Me","Okay, okay. I know there have been many Amazon reviews for this product, but, here goes. I bought this kitchen gadget a while back and have used it on enough occasions to satisfy my conclusion. It flat will not work for me. I read most of the reviews for this item on Amazon and have to agree with the negative ones for this product. I have many OXO kitchen tools that work just fine ( i.e. see my review for the apple corer and divider). Whenever I used this one on a ripe Mango (whether the Mango was peeled or not) I got smush. I even tried cutting the bottom off of the fruit to stabilize it prior to my splitting attempts as recommended by one of the Amazon reviewers. Smush again. When I used it on a Mango that was not ripe, it worked. However, unripened, green Mangoes are not my preference for eating or preparing sauces. They taste terrible. Accordingly, I cannot recommend this OXO product."
5,Great Tool,This is a great tool for cutting up mangos. One push and it's cut from the seed. Makes fast work of any mango. I wish I would have found this a long time ago.
4,I love mangos,"The mango splitter worked very well, but it also required some strength on my part, altho not as much as the pineapple slicer."
5,finally something that makes my life easier,This makes cutting a mango so much easier since it is very difficult to do. Washes up easily and for the money is a real bargain.
5,A Must-Have for Mango Lovers,"It's the most amazing kitchen gadget out there! I was skeptical, even after reading all the 5-star reviews here. When mine arrived I made sure I had a mango ready to be split. I couldn't believe how great this thing works! The end result is just like the picture...a clean cut, plenty of mango meat and no stringy pit to fight with. Easy to use too!"
5,A must!,I never imagined that cutting a mango could be this easy. I stabilized the fruit first by taking a slice off of the stem end and had great results on the first try.
4,Mango Splitter OK,This mango splitter does make coring a mango easier. But it is just a little akward to use. You have to apply a lot of pressure when using the slicer and the mango tends to slide around.
1,It doesn't work for me,"I have tried serveral times to get a clean cut into the mango, but all it does is get stuck on the pit and it smashes the mango."
3,Oxo Mango Splitter,This is something that you need but wow it is hard to line-up the location of the pit. Useful.
2,A knife works better...,"Maybe I just don't get it, but lining this up/holding the mango still/pressing down on the mango hard enough to cut it, is very difficult. I just went back to slicing it with a knife. It is bulky and takes up too much space in my drawer. I gave it a 2/5 due to the fact that I'm sure someone else uses it effectively and I really like the OXO brand and have many, many other tools from them that I love. I however, wish I would have saved the $10 bucks on this one."
4,The Kaizen Revolution,"Mr. Regan presents an easy read in novel form (ala ""The Goal"" by Elyahu Goldratt) giving the reader a sound introduction to the Toyota Production System (aka Lean Manufacturing). Anyone reading this book can gain a sound understanding of what steps to take, and why to take them, as you begin on the Lean journey. You'll close the back cover with an understanding of many ""Lean Concepts"" as well as a very sound introduction to the how and why's of preparing for and conducting a Kaizen event. The chapter summaries are very beneficial in helping you capture the nuggets of knowledge that you can easily overlook as you become engrossed in the story. Don't let this book be your only source of knowledge on TPS, but be sure to include it in your reading."
3,Fair,DreamHealer two is a very simple book that reminds me of someone that has limited writing abilities.
3,Garden railroading,"It is a good basic book for someone new to the hobby. And I'm about as new as you can get.I also found Getting Started in garden Railroading by Allan Miller, very helpful."
5,Just Right,This book threads the fine line between the Laymen and the professional. Just the right amount of info without getting stuck in specialization on any one beast.
3,Not an excellent book,This books seems to negelect most informations about the molecular data. Also the the discussion about the natural history of extant and extinct species are a bit brief.
2,Brodie's review,Ben and his family move away. Ben and his dad never get along. And his sister is considered the best thing that ever happened in the whole world to his parents. In his old town it took him about his whole life to make his best firend Herbie. When Ben first gets to his new town he gets in truoble all the time. Then one day when he walking on the beach he sees a girl that can skip stones like no boy he ever seen.This girls name is Regina. But very strange very good but very strange things start happening. Life starts getting better in little ways. Ben has heard about maybe her and her grandma being a witch. Could this be ture or is she just a normal person. Ben doesnt know that to beleive. This is an okay book. Its slow on some parts but then on other parts you just can't put it down.
3,Clamp?,The holding power of the clamp is somewhat lacking and it is virtually useless with out the optional wide jaws(they should be included with the clamp from the get go). The pictures of the clamp are very deceiving it looks nice and wide but in reality the clamp is only 1 3/4 inches wide and the lock handle seems a bit flimsy and will probably need replacing with repetitive use. However overall the clamp is nice for ripping plywood down to size and it can also be used as a fence on various stationary saws.
1,Bad clamp,"I got this clamp to use as a straight edge with a saw but it does not clamp into place worth a darn. It's not worth much more than a paper weight. As soon as you push up ageist it, it will move."
2,marginally useful,"Not horrid but without theAll in One Clamp #WJ Wide Jaws Fixture for All in One Clamp (2-Pack)for another $17 per clamp, the clamp faces are too narrow to make contact with anything but flat boards. The T track is of no use as its a peculiar size so they get to sell more accessories. They do work OK as a straight edge but not nearly as good as the Bora 540950 50 Inch Aluminum Guide Clamp Edge, they make a bunch of sizes. I thought I was getting a good deal from Rockler on a blow out set of 24"", 36"" and 50"". Turns out to not be a good deal after all. I see now why they are getting rid of them cheap.BTW I thought that the marking tape was a good idea--NOT! It is hard to align accurately and even that is dubious. Maybe OK for rough framing but not otherwise."
4,A book about losing ones muse.,"I enjoyed this amusing story of a town that has lost their muse. Not only has Maude lost her muse to paint but other members of the town have lost their muse to do creative endeavors like building birdhouses, writing poetry, knitting,playing the sax,loving and dancing. I loved the characters and the wonderful resolution."
5,Delightful book. Will free your spirit.,"From an early age, Maud's father let his free-spirited daughter cover their house with her folksy artwork. Eventually it becomes a famous tourist attraction in their small Vermont town.When Maud's father dies, she falls into a dreary marriage with George, a man who takes care of her, but ends up whitewashing her house and her creative spirit. When George dies, Maud has a humorous and insightful one-sided conversation with her dead husband in a struggle to regain her artistic soul.I loved this book. I loved Maud's voice and the quirky townsfolk who all seemed to have lost something special to them after Maud's downfall.Ms. Roberts has an unique lyrical style which, the best way I can describe it, feels like floating on gentle waves. You just have to read it to see what I mean.I also enjoyed her 'Book of Mercy' and look forward to reading more of her work."
4,A Fine Contextual Study of the Declaration of Independence,"Garry Wills' Inventing America is clearly a labor of love. Its learned, precise, and passionate scholarship effectively skewers much of the scholarship that preceded it. Wills forcefully repudiates the common assertion (derived largely from Carl Becker's important work) that the Declaration of Independence is an utterly Lockean document. Instead, Wills shows that Thomas Jefferson was only slightly influenced by Locke, and was instead completely a product of the Scottish Enlightenment. By placing key terms and phrases in the context of 18th century America, Wills brings the meaning of the Declaration to life, and alters its existence from a vague philosophical statement that we merely ""see"" rather than ""read"" into a specific political document with very particular meanings and functions.It is a shame that this book is out of print; it should be required reading to students of the history of American Independence."
5,shipping wars season 1,"I love this show, shipping wars season 1. The people are funny and interesting. The show has kept me entertained for many hours. It downloaded easily. The quality is great, crisp and clear."
1,worst book ever about San Miguel,"This book is so filled with errors, both typo and factual, that when I read it I got out a red pen and marked all the mistakes. The book apparently had no editor, since most apostrophes and commas are missing entirely - yes! Plus, there are many, many blank spaces in the book, prompting one to wonder what got left out (and who cares, anyway?).In addition, the pages begin to fade out towards the end of the book, as if she printed it on a home printer and it ran out of ink. This book deserves maybe a half a star, but that's not an option on Amazon.The factual errors are simply amazing. Since the copyright page only says it was published in San Miguel de Allende under the name of Jane McCarthy, one has to assume it's a really bad self-published book.There are plenty of other books about this wonderful Mexican town. This author should be ashamed of herself for cranking out this POS."
4,Finally won me over!,"Note:-I'm male-This is a UNISEX fragrance.-light fragrance-does not leave a bad smell after it wears offI was looking for a new ""scent"" when my cologne ran out and this seemed like a good replacement. The first couple of times I used it I swore that I had just bought perfume (for women). I was going to give it to my wife but decided to keep it since she actually liked it on me.It was only after a few times that I used it that it finally grew on me. No no no, it did not actually GROW on me, but I started liking it ^_^It has, as another user puts it, ""wet leafy"" scent that leaves the ""violet leaf and delicate citrus notes to hang cooly over a perfectly orchestrated fresh and watery woody base."" [I could not find a better way to describe the scent this fragrance leaves!!]I'll think about getting a bigger bottle in the future!"
1,Dead on arrival,"Arrived packed well, but was DOA. Could not be made to work. Vendor offered to make good, but it was not practical for me to return it due to an impending extended out state emergency which distracted me and I forgot all abut it till I saw that I had not reviewed it. Purchased abut 2 years ago. Probably not worth the time & effort and cost to mail it back. Bought another similar shaped thermometer from a different spplier which worked well. Probably a god product if you received one which worked."
1,Poor Quality Thermometer.,You pay for what you get when it comes to this item. I ordered for of them. They all have stop working in less then a month of use. My advice to you all is not to bother with this item and pay a little more money and get another type.
2,Jenn-Air cook Book,You get what you pay for and this little book is all of that and less. It is a VERY basic introduction into convection cooking which I wanted to know with a new Jenn-air stove/oven.
1,Breaks easily,Bought 2 of these and the head comes off the rubber extention quite eaily and makes it useless. Would suggest Zopid lights
2,Not that great,"Doesn't always stay in place over your ear. Also, the joint between the tip and the body is not flexible. So you cannot change the angle of the light. So sometimes the light doesn't point to your book. You have to keep your head at an angle and not move it so that the light points in the right direction. This is very uncomfortable."
5,DEVESTATING STORY OF STOLEN INNOCENCE AND CHILDHOOD TORTURE,"A book difficult to put down until totally finished and once completed leaves the reader yearning for more information. What other plights are around the corner for young Michaela after she reunites with a mother who had abandoned her in childhood, leaving her defenseless against her tormentors? This is a devestating true story of a young child who endured countless acts of physical and emotional abuse. Skillfully written and detailed. Hopefully the next chapter of Michaela's life will soon unfold for us on the pages of a second novel."
2,Why only one CD?,"One of the best stories I have played in years, great movies and good characters. The concept is great, but, this are the things that destroy it in the end:1. Very few kinds of enemies2. Very few kinds of friends3. You have to search in the same maze a lot of times, and every time you leave an area all the enemies you just destroy appear again, making this game boring after a while4. The concepts of the magic and abilities are great, but the animations of the spells are childish5. The world is very smallFor the next game, at least, put three CDs in the package, and you will have a winner"
2,I' Rather be Sleeping,"Now don't get me wrong, Septerra Core is a good game. Well, at least for the first hour. After that the gameplay gets so repitive and slow I almost fell asleep. The maker of the game also put in faces while people are talking, much like Grandia. But they try to make it look state of the art by having their lips move, but it looks more like cheap clay animation. They also repeat the faces and NPC models, just cutting off the beard someone has and calling that person a whole new person. And the voice acting, don't even get me started on that. If you must get this lackluster game, you should problaly spring for the Jewel Case that includes the awesome Shogo."
5,Rrrrrrrrruuuuuullllllleeeeeeeeessssssss!,Rules! Rules! Rules! This game really rocks! How can some people not like it?
5,Great value and quiet to boot,"This is the 2nd Frigidaire 451P I've purchased for our home--it's easy to set up and is very quiet compared to many on the market. Nice styling, too, as far as these things go."
3,works ok,It works ok. Not exactly at a 90 degree angle. It may be ok for somethings but not for making picture frames. I got beter results by just glueing the ends to gether and letting them sit un clamped.
1,Even Too Loud For Drunk Sleep!,"I couldn't even pass out this air conditioner is so loud! I got it last summer for my unbearably hot college apartment and everything went swimmingly. It was a little loud, like the air flow was loud, but it was kind of a soothing noise. Now, luckily a little less than a year later, it is SUPER loud, it revs up, rattles, and rolls. It kind of sounds like a dishwasher disposal. I called up Frigidaire and they said that my model is unrepairable and must be replaced. Luckily I didn't procrastinate on this because my one-year warranty is almost up!I barely recommend this air conditioner. If you are desperate get a warranty and plan on having it replaced. It's even too loud for drunk sleep!"
4,"Good overall, though a bit noisy","I really like the appearance of this air conditioner and the ability to set the desired temperature. The electronic controls have been great so far, as well as on the remote control. I haven't had it for very long yet, so I can't speak to its durability.The one thing that stands out is that it is loud. Granted, I have a small bedroom and the air conditioner is set in a window right at the end of my bed, but it still seems loud to me.Again, overall, I am very happy with this purchase and I especially like that it is an energy saver."
4,Great Deal,"I live in a very small studio apartment on the third floor of an apartment building in Dupont Circle, Washington, DC. The building is ancient and has no central air, but this little guy does the trick. It's relatively quiet and powerful enough to keep my @500 sq. ft. studio comfortably cool. It comes with a handy little remote and has an Energy Saver setting (not sure what that does, but I use it as it doesn't seem to change the performance). Install is easy, just follow the directions - shortcuts are NOT a very good idea, particularly if your window is high up (image of grand piano falling on cartoon character's head pops into mine). My only complaint is the unit beeps when you change the settings which is loud and somewhat annoying. Luckily, with the DC humidity and summer swelter, I rarely have to change it from ""60"" (lowest degree setting) and ""High""."
4,Good AC,"This is a pretty good AC for the price. I'm not sure why some people are saying it's a loud unit. It will depend greatly on how the AC is installed and the current condition of the window frame. Mine runs fairly quiet. I installed mine using M-D Building Products 6619 Sponge Rubber Tape, 3/8-by-1/2-Inch-by-10 feet, Closed Cell tape to help prevent window vibration. My windows are also fairly new and well constructed. An older house/window frames may experience more rattling.I'm interested in seeing how well this AC handles extreme heat. It seems to be doing OK when temps reach the 80's but I'm wondering if it can handle 90+. I'm also only trying to cool down just the bedroom. It would not be adequate for an entire apartment."
2,WHat a piece of Cra..p,"I have tried two Frigidaire units. Both are extremely loud with the compressor going nuts when it kicks in. The fans used inside the unit are very low quality and you get the feeling that when the AC is not, the fan hits the water creating a water splashing sound inside the AC... returned both...just horrible"

4,Through Generations,"I first heard this book as a grade school student, then I read it to my childern, now I'm buying it for my grandchildren. This wonderful adventure spans the generations.Thank you,Madeleine L'Engle"
5,Fun read,"Spider-man Marvel Encyclopedia: Is a great find for any Spider-Man or fan of comics. I was alittle afraid that it would be likke the last oneThe Hulk Encyclopedia"" so at frist I was scared to waste my money on it. But I was surpised and shocked how great the book is. It's far better than the last three. A must have for any fan!!!"
2,dissapointing ending,"i was really intrigued with the the story, but the ending, that it was just a demon's doing disappointed me so much..to learn that it was other people's souls,so like the listeners...and the crystals, so last vampirish....i really did not like the ending, i mean, im a huge christopher pike fan,still will be though, always will be,....well its a good book to keep you guessing,...."
2,A sad dissapointment,"After waiting forever, I was so excited to get this book, then halfway through it I decided it wasn't worth that long of a wait. Having read all, and I do mean all of Pike's books, this is by far the worst. It doesn't even rank near The Season of Passage or even his young adult books. I too had to stop and ponder just how absurd the end of the book was. He tries to give a medical justification to a way out there scenario. Then the end just - ends. It does close the story, but leaves you wondering a lot of things. It does contain a story within a story, but in reality, the plot of the inner story has nothing to do with the plot. It was just a way to introduce a sexual relationship (which there are waaay to many of). So my advice is to either wait for the paperback or borrow it from a friend. It isn't worth the price. Although I will be a fan till the end, I have to hope that his next novel is a WHOLE lot better."
4,A disappointing ending,"Christopher Pike was my favourite author when I was a teenager, so when I picked this up I EXPECTED to love it. And I did... until I got to the last fifty pages, where I was left going ""Oh PUH-LEASE!!!"" Pike seems to have put all his effort into setting the story up and then just slapped some random far-fetched explanation for everything on the end. I was left with an overall sense of disappointment. This novel could have been so much better..."
2,What a Disappointment,"This is not a commentary on the Book of Acts. It is instead a discourse by Professor Pelikan, telling us how much he knows about the ways the Church Fathers and the Greek Orthodox Church interpreted the Book of Acts.It includes far, far too many sentences like this one: ""The resurrection of Christ was the supreme manifestation of the divine dialectic that had been typologically foreshadowed in the recognition scene between the patriarch Joseh and his brothers: . . . ""The Brazos commentary on Matthew, by Stanley Hauerwas, is one of the most helpful and enlightening commentaries I have ever read. But this one on Acts is deadly dull. Be warned."
5,Leading with a Limp,"As a leadership development consultant in both churches and public organizations, this is the finest book on leadership I have ever read...including all of the reading for my Masters in Coaching in Organizations.Allender is to be commended for the book and the intensely personal and developmentally probing questions in the workbook. I will be using this for the next leadership class I facilitate!!!"
5,Best leadership study I've read yet! Outstanding!!,"For leaders who have been in that vocation for some time, this book serves as a refresher, and perhaps the acknowledgment of the methods leaders choose. Focused on long-term organizational growth and health, it reminds one that short term gains are the province of managers, while leaders continually challenge and motivate people to achieve the extraordinary. For the new leader, this is an in-depth primer, broken down into chunks small enough to digest, but full of insight and inspiration. It is not a how-to book per se, but does outline a path towards better leadership, and challenges one to develop themselves with a purpose. I loved it! My copy is note-ridden, earmarked, annotated, and continually referred to for anecdotes and ideas. Buy a copy for every developing leader beneath you, and start a development plan for them all."
2,Even the Acknowledgements are too long. Cliff Notes anywhere,"I only wish Kouzes and Posner were constrained to 1000 words. That would have been totally sufficent to make the points they present. In an increasingly time limited business world, few have got the time to read 300+ pages of common sense and obvious facts. Read it if you have to (It was assigned by my MBA Prof.), but try and find someone else who has, they could sum up the substance in a few minutes."
2,This book would have you believe in the tooth fairy,"""The Prince"" describes real leadership. The book talks about honesty as the number one trait we would like to see in leaders. But in reality, it is the person who can lie well that succedes. While the authors make you feel like you have the power to take on the universe, really the tools and traits they describe leads mainly to mediocrity."
4,Best of Silk Road is Also Best of Kitaro,"A good album. If you like the theme from The Silk Road, you could also purchase the original video of The Silk Road produced by NHK TV Japan. Kitaro's music is soothing and an excellent accessory to meditation."
4,smaller than anticipated,When this book came i was surprised to see how small it was!!! It's about the size of the palm of my hand so i guess it's good for little hands. It's about as well written as any baby book so nothing to complain about there.
4,Does what it's supposed to do..,"I have my Dish Receiver and Blu-ray player plugged into this switch. They both only take a couple of seconds for a successful HDCP handshake with this switch. I can't attest to the long term reliability of this product having it only for a few days. However, it seems to work well in terms of functionality and picture quality. The provided remote also works quite well. It also seems to remain very cool considering it is a HDMI amplifier and not a passive unit.The reality is that this is a no name electronic product from China. I don't really see a brand name anywhere. Therefore, my main concern is longevity. Only time will tell."
5,Great for additional ports,"This product does exactly what I purchased it for and has worked flawlessly since I hooked it up. The remote has a kind of cheap feeling and only has 3 buttons for each of the 3 HDMI ports, but it does exactly what it's suppose to. I have had this product for over a year now and it's still functioning with no problem."
1,Don't Buy.... Does not work!!!!!!,Produces shotty picture quality with blue lines flashing across the picture.Buyer Beware!!!! Retuned item and replaced with item tagged.The new item works great!!!!!
4,Great short-fiction from Herbert,"Herbert was as good at producing tight short stories as epic, far-reaching novels. The story ""Murder Will In"" is the best ""body-stealer"" tale I've come across. His terrific ""Devil in the Sea"" (aka Under Pressure) is, for some reason, only half published in this book! What a dumb mistake!"
4,eye,"If you like Frank Herbert's writing and the dune series, you'll like the short story road to dune, and Herbert's favorite short story Seed Stock"
2,"limited apllication, disappointing","After year's of frustration with MS-Access, culminating with OfficeXP, I switched to FileMaker Pro. The software user manual and tutorial are first class (MicroSoft ought to try it) but, seeing prior experience with Access, I hoped to get additional insights from this book. Frankly, I didn't. It seems cookbook, poorly organized, dully written and of little use without a practice CD-rom. Worse, the latest FileMaker Pro 5.5 updates were tacked onto the end -- making this a poorly organized reference text. Disappointing!"
3,Vague and Ordinary,"I have a high level interest in holistic medicine and have read much on the subject. I had hopes that this book, written by a medical doctor, would be eye-opening. It wasn't. Her advice can be summed up thus: eat lots of veggies (preferably organic), eat (organic, free-range) chicken, but not beef, avoid all processed foods, avoid dairy, and take her ""liver tonic"". Good advice, but not ""WOW""! By the time I finished the book, I realized that I'd been ""had"". It was a well-couched plug for her supplement. Follow the diet, but get the same herbs from the health food store and cleanse your liver for a lot less money. Liver Blend SP-13 100 caps"
3,Book was good info -- but didn't go with the diet.,"I was having some medical difficulties and I purchased this book as part of some research I was doing for my own knowledge at the time after having some tests done. After consulting with my doctors my final decision was not to use the diet that is outlined in the book. I do feel the book contains good information and can be a great solution for some people - just make sure that it (or any diet) is right for you and your body before you dive in head first, consulting with a doctor and/or nutritionist is always a good idea."
2,"Good basis, too much hocum","If you want a book which will give you good eating guidelines then this will be a good buy. However, I do object to the unproven hokum attached to this book. Sandra Cabot complains in the beginning of the book that people have denigrated her methods without trying it themselves. However, there is no reference to proper testing within her book to prove her claims. One other reviewer states you have to have a positive attitude to make this work - great, but don't use that mantra to accept any old hokum that comes your way. Healthy eating and drinking is a great thing and this tells you how to do it properly. Believe the other stuff if it helps."
1,"No science here, dissapointing to see this from Aust. MD.",Much anecdotal evidence and story telling and little fact.If you are looking for quality medical advice on diet you will not find that in this book.
3,like a compendium of tabloid articles,"As an earlier reviewer cited, this is great primary material. Tons of facts. But no writing style. Nothing to thread it together, no themes. It's an easy read, but it gets tedious because the book does not have an overall angle/perspective/voice. So it's just bunches of stories and facts."
5,This book has it all...,"This book is incredibly inclusive, covering bacteria, antibiotics, viruses and parasites. I was impressed with the explantions given and was humored by the anecdotes and pictures. I would reccomend this book to both those studying for exams and working in the feild."
5,Basic Pen Knife Carving With Tom Wolfe,I have been a sculptor in clay for many years and do casting of my work in pewter. Recently I decided to take up wood carving as well. The first Tom Wolfe book I read I borrowed from a friend. It was this book. It is easy to understand and Mr. Wolfe takes you thru each step. It was so helpful in learning to carve with pen knives I had to buy my own copy to keep as reference and will use it for many years to come. This is a wonderful book for beginners and great for long time carvers as a reference. He uses simple terms and easy to understand directions. The first carving I did following his direction is beautiful and sold for $90.00!
2,Azzarello has done much better,"100 Bullets writer Brian Azzarello was handed the task of revamping Marvel's Luke Cage AKA Power Man, Hero for Hire; a 70's super hero into the modern day and slapping the book with Marvel's MAX title (basically the equivalent to an R-rated movie). While the art by Richard Corben is superb, Azzarello's writing is a surprising disappointment. Cage has been turned from a just trying to do the right thing reluctant hero into a gangsta thug just trying to get paid. He's not much caring about the job he has accepted (avenging the death of a slain girl) and comes off more like a gangster rapper than a super hero. Brian Michael Bendis, who has given Luke Cage a great characterization in Alias and Daredevil, should have been the scribe here, and even though Azzarello is a superb writer in his own right, Cage just comes off as pointless. All in all, Cage is a very disappointing read."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Luke in more of a low-life phase. It is almost, at times like this guy is a completely different character than your Hero for Hire shown in your standard Marvel comics. Perhaps that is part of the point, as just being a Hero For Hire means you have murkier motivations. Here though, it is a lot more to the Hoodlum For Hire side of things."
5,Almost As Wonderful As Howl's Moving Castle,"I ordered this book after having read Howl's Moving Castle multiple times. Needless to say, I had pretty high expectations for it. I first read A House of Many Way, and then this one because that was the recommended order (you'll find out why once you read them). This book was almost as good as Howl's Moving Castle! I found myself somewhat skeptical at the beginning, but was hooked by the second chapter. I finished it in two days. It was a quick read, but it also had an unsatisfactory ending for me. I won't say why, but the rest of the book was simply dazzling. If you're a fan of Diana Wynne's Jones' other titles, this is a must have. Actually, anyone interested in a fantastical, quirky story will enjoy this addition to Jones's already impressive collection."
1,Trash,"This album is complete trash. These artists cant even cover someone else and do them justice, much less put out their own material. If your considering buying this, hit the back button on your browser and by a REAL FUEL CD instead!"
2,Not what it promises.,"We have had simular products but this one does not work. The mat is soft but the suction cups do not work. Not matter what you do, they will not work so the mat slips and slides. I bought two when I ordered but I will return one of them. Don't waste your money."
3,Maybe there's a limit....,"I've always enjoyed Cecil and have, over the years, purchased his first four books. And it's true--each volume is a bit less fascinating than the previous. It really seems that the most familiar, universal, and entertaining imponderables were addressed in the earlier volumes. Odd, but seemingly true. Still, keep going Cecil!"
4,A gem of a book that everyone should read,"Absolutely wonderful book that gives do-ale suggestions for unsticking all the places your life is in a rut. Kasl is a psychotherapist in addition to practicing buddhism. Her advice is well thought out and clearly presented. I found myself digging deep within myself and my motivations. It may be a little ""fluffy"", but I strongly feel most people who benefit from this book. I know I was able to make some positive changes. Highly recommend."
4,"A VERY FUNNY SHOW! BUT, NOT FOR EVERYONE!","Liking this show depends on how much you like Sarah. I think she is a funny gal, so I like the show. The show is full of potty humor and she does have a very good ""off the wall"" supporting cast. Since there are only 6 episodes included in season 1, I won't be buying this set unless it drops down in price a little. I can't wait to see season two!"
2,"Two stars for Sarah's two beautiful, bouncing talents","She's cute, she talks naughty and she's j**ish... ergo, she's funny? Wrong.Sarah is painful to watch as she strains so hard to be 'cute' and 'funny,' much like she's straining to have a bowel movement. Please give the nice girl a laxative. The dog is way better and he steals every scene.The other actors are talented but watching Sarah 'act' self-absorbed is ironic---the irony? It's not an act.Were she to do her show in the nude I might watch... for at least a few minutes anyway, but as it is....mmmmmm... no."
4,Quirky and smart,"Sarah is quite the funny girl. The show (disc), meaning Sarah and the rest of the shows cast, are quirky yet smart in the delivery and messages. A hoot and a real breath of fresh air."
3,Not as much fun as the backhoe,"My son got this crane and the Mighty Backhoe for birthday and Christmas last year. He really wanted the crane and had asked Santa for it, so even though he already had the backhoe, we (Santa) got him the crane. He played with it at first, but lately it sits idle while he plays with the backhoe. I think the crane mechanism is just too much work to operate, and you can't really do anything with it unless you let go of the handles and manually open the crane jaws to pick something up. Plus the string comes untied from the crane bucket at least once a week. All in all, I would say the crane is cool to look at, but the backhoe is a much more usable and fun toy to play with."
3,A little disappointed,"I am a big fan of the metal Tonka trucks. My son has the dump truck (which he loves) and the backhoe (which he also loves). I bought the crane thinking it would be a great addition to his backyard fleet. For the most part it is, however if your child is rough and tough like my 3 year old, you might encounter some problems. For one thing it kept tipping over when he would try to operate it and then the bucket came off and had to be retied on. He still plays with it but I was a little disappointed in Tonka on this one."
5,Grandson was thrilled,My grandson loves his Tonka toys. I love the durability and quality of the toys.
2,Only three stories included -- missing two!,"We were totally disappointed by this purchase -- George and Martha Rise and Shine is one of James Marshall's best. However, what a disappointment to discover that (inexplicably) two of the stories that we've come to love after checking this book out of the library numerous times are not included in this new edition. How about a complete version, please???"
5,Livin in Sweden,I just want to say how sad I am that you don`t ship M&M to sweden. I LOOOVVEEE does games and would really want to have the Compilation at home. If someone knows how I can buy the Compilation to Sweden mail to e-mail adress nenadmitrovic@hotmail.com
1,Save your money and buy the more expensive version,"We bought this product for $7.97 and the 30"", 32"" Or 36""W Instant Screen-36-Inch Wide for $39.95 to compare. This screen door fell down after 2 weeks because the velcro fell off the adhesive that was stuck to the door frame. While the more expensive version stayed on the door all summer long. The main problem is that they didn't include adhesive velcro they include fabric velcro that's stuck to a piece of double-sided adhesive foam that isn't strong enough to hold up the screen. So you need to buy your own adhesive velcro and don't use the velcro that comes with the product."
1,Completely Disappointed,"I was so excited to see this arrive today in the mail that I immediately opened it and watched it. I kept waiting for the primary content to start. I am completely disappointed in this DVD. The format that this was filmed and edited in is beyond amateur. The opinion based ""journey"" equated to that of a story as told by a 10 year old.To clarify, I am not one to discount any belief nor do I in this film. The topic here ""could"" have been shared in a MUCH better way. I wanted to be educated not mystified with swirls of color. I wanted to be spoke to not watch as those being interviewed searched the air for their next answer.Do yourself a favor, look elsewhere for documentaries on this subject.For those that rated this with 5 stars, I don't know what to say to you.My overall Rating is LESS THAN 1 STAR!Rating on a 1-10 ScaleTopic = 10Editing = 1Audio Quality = 7Video Quality = 4Content Quality = 3Content Delivery = 1Believable Cast =2"
1,EXASPERATING!,"I know most of the speakers in this film. Their collective attempt to convey information about a complex topic dealing with the afterlife, though appreciated, fails miserably. What bothers me about this video, almost to a degree of torture, are the excessive and highly distractive fractals appearing in the visual montages when one member of the cast, Neal Donald Walsh, monotonously and unconvincingly expresses (in a whispy voice) his own belief in life after death of the physical body. The fractals are not only very annoying, but have nothing to do with the subject matter of the film. The movie is about a fascinating topic, but its message is poorly delivered and its credibility is significantly diminished. In short, based on my own personal experience, I would not recommend this DVD to anyone, but would ask them to look elsewhere for information about possible immortality achieved through changes of states of existence."
4,pleased by the way death is protrade,"as a believer in after life and the death process I have read many books on death and the afterlife and i thought this DVD was a nice way to sum it all up in a visual, commentary type way as some people find it more effect to have some thing in visual as appose to reading about it.I think the DVD was very well made, exspecially in accordance with my own beliefs.A spiritual path is an individual one and each one must decide what is true for them, perhaps this DVD may help some one who is either dying, finding peace in death itself or knows someone who is dying and this may help you to help them threw the process."
4,Septic Helper - No Harm,"Being on a Septic system, a disposal is dicouraged... so we use it as little as possible. We use this to help offset it when we do use it.Lowe's recently stopped carrying it locally, so we had to go to the Web to get it... That we went to the trouble of finding and ordering it should speak for its self..."
2,Poor Quality,This ring is very poor quality. The diamonds are gray. Find something else to purchase.
4,Very nice lamp,"Received delivery of this lamp today, through the Wayfair seller, only two days after I placed my order. Has a well made pleated shade, and ivory color. The lamp's purpose was to brighten a dark corner, and that it does. Surprised and pleased at the low price."
2,Synthetic smell,Largely a synthetic smell. I ordered based off a sample and it didn't live up to my expectations. I would recommend getting the smaller amount even though it is relatively speaking a bit more expensive.
3,"It is good, but is nothing great!","I bought this after reading all the reviews here in Amazon and ratings in some other websites. This is a good perfume, but is a bit overrated. If I apply it in the morning, I get the smell for a couple of hours. I think, you get what you pay for. It is definitely worth the price."
5,LOVE THIS SCENT!!!,"I bought this for my husband at the local mall and let me tell you, when he wears it I am ready to take him down!!! I am very attracted to good smelling colognes for men and this is top notch!!! I have even worn it myself to work and received lots of complements......it's great. It is different from what he had been wearing and it is a great change....."
4,Good price...,"This is a very good men's cologn. And a very good price. Couldn't wait to get it and it smells good. Went to couple of stores to find, and it was expensive. Came in a box and brand new. The cologn lasts a long time, so that is good. Overall a good value."
2,overrated author,"I found alot of the authors references extremely dubious. For example, if Murray Humphries was such a smart mobster I find it hard to believe that he would allow his wife to keep a written journal detailing how the Kennedy election was fixed. The author also left out details of references to bolster his case that with the death of Tony Accordo the Outfit died also. When he cites an article called ""Mob Lite"" stating that there are only 50 outfit members remaining, he left out the part stating that there are at 700-1200 associates remaining and how they are more sophisticated than ever. I only wonder what else he left out."
5,Garden Creations JB5285 Electronic Bug Zapper Racket,"Keeping the sport in bug zapping, this handy dandy handheld model takes it to competitive levels. The more passive models may be as effective, but are they as FUN? Can you feel SATISFIED? Can you COMPETE?Please note that this is not a safe toy with a child around (and they are going to be soooo tempted, particularly if a younger sibling is close). Definitely a must have for the barbeque boy, porch princess, and all those Happy Campers. Hint: You probably will need more than one."
5,"Works better than expected against ""fruit flies""","I wasn't sure what to expect with this product. We've developed a inundation of ""fruit flies"" in our house over the last 3 months and I purchased several variants of fly swatters. These little ""flies"" are a nuisance. They are no bigger than a mosquito and seem equally attracted to people. They don't bite but they are a nuisance and will fly around your ear or even up your nose as you are about to fall asleep.This product works amazingly well. I popped in 2 D batteries and was ready. When you pick it up, you hold the button down and it's active; when you set it down, you release button and it goes off. It's simple to use and you hardly need to look at the directions. Within my first hour while working at my desk, I killed over a half dozen of these pesky irritants. And ooooh the ""zap"" is so satisfying... instant unambiguous death to these critters. After two days, death toll almost 20 and noticeably fewer of these pests bothering me."
3,Fun and handy...but kind of cheap in quality,"I had a fun time zapping bugs with these. Most of the time the zap only stunned the fly. But that still gave me plenty of time to pick it up and flush it (better than smashing them with a regular swatter and having to clean up the mess).My only complaint is that they are cheap in quality. The button on one of my swatters was jammed when I received it. I was still able to use it for a few days, but it eventually jammed completely.The other one still works, but that darn button is starting to jam. I rarely use it anymore, but if I did, I'm pretty sure the button would have messed up like the other. I'm pretty sure I can figure out a way to fix them, but why should I have to?"
4,Effective use of Electric Fly Swatter,"This thing is fun to use but for a single fly it is not as effective as a skillfully used standard fly swatter.However if you have a bunch of flies and they buzz up from a surface this can be swept rapidly back and forth through the buzzing swarm quite effectively and it will get a number of them at a time. However if you only stun the fly - somtimes they recover so you should be prepared to step on stunned ones that are still moving if they are on the floor.If a fly is on a flat surface and you can slowly sneak up on it, then you can often get it because the fly will leap up into the grid.I would like to see one that had a longer handle for more rapid movement.I have my best success if the swarm of flies is in a corner."
1,Seems like a good idea but...........,".....maybe I am slower than I used to be but the flies, wasps, etc. move a little faster than I can whip this device. Best use is to swat'em with an old fashion fly swatter pick'em up and drop them on the Bug Zapper and listen to them crackle. More entertaining than effective."
4,The Fly Was VAPORIZED!,"YIKES! We whacked a fly with this thing and it disappeared. We think it was vaporized. After looking at each other in shock, my son said, ""What else can we kill?""This thing is powerful...but unfortunately, you still have to have aim and reflexes in order to swat a fly."
4,"Cheap but gets the job done, for a while.","Expect 3-4 weeks of bug war before either the electronics short out or something plastic breaks inside because of the force required to swing it and get your kills. If you know where to look, you can get them really cheap, so they are worth the price. I suggest buying more than one at a time so you have a backup or ambidextrous wield."
1,This product is JUNK,This is the second product of this type I have ordered. The first one did not work - it was returned and replaced with a second one that work for about 3 weeks and stopped functioning. BUYER BEWARE!
2,43-188 sled,"The sled is great but the holdowns are the problem, as they dont release fully and if you adjust they dont hold enough!!!! I went to tigthen one down ad the aluminumm frame broke!!! too bAD fro a poorly designed clamps. I think China has influxed into Delta and ruined what was our best line of tools. (sigh)"
4,Another sloppy physics history,"Reviewer Ted Sung pointed out a sloppy remark of physics history made by the book. There is another serious mistake appeared on Page 91: The Yang-Mills gauge theory has never been awarded a Nobel Prize. C. N. Yang did get the Prize in 1957, but it was conferred to him and his another collaborator T. D. Lee for a different contribution to physics (postulating that parity is not conserved under weak interactions). Unfortunately the author did not perform a simple research on history but rather believed in his speculation. My four-star rating does not count in this unforgivable carelessness. Devlin has done a good job in popularizing these great mathematical problems. Perhaps someone could deliver even a finer exposition. However, it would definitely demand the readers another level of mathematical sophistication."
1,Lousy toy,"I agree with the other reviewer. My 20 month old twins love drawing on it but they have to come to me to erase it. There is simply no way they could master it themselves. Not only is it hard to grasp and pull down but you have to use your other hand to brace it and yourself to be able to do it. I'm actually trying to reach the manufacturer to complain/return. Oh yeah, the little stamps keep getting lost because if when I push them in tight enough to not fall out, my kids can't get them out themselves."
2,Fun while it lasted,"My grandson loves this toy, however, the entire middle section of the screen won't erase completely. He has only had this for 8 months and this happened within the first three months. He still uses it and loves to play with it, but I will be looking at buying another one somewhere else so it will erase. Great concept, just didn't last. He is two years old."
3,"Overall Good, but Too expensive","Without a metal strap, I am more satisfied. It is too expensive in comparison with other alternative products. You can buy each product with low budget if you can ignore brand name value.However, the leather case is a must. I recommend you to buy it separately in Amazon.com. Canon Battery I just purchased is good. I bought it because of name value. You can not lose anything with other compatible products."
2,I can't believe I wasted my money,"This expansion pack (EP) was a complete wast of my time, and money. It adds a couple new magical weapons and armor, some new spells and a couple new areas to explore. There is no plot to the the EP, just some NPC saying ""Oh I lost my son in Durlags Tower. . . ."" and stuff like that. The only thing that made this EP worth two stars is that they cleaned up a lot of the rough edges from Baldurs Gate, and increased Experience points to a point where your fighter and like one other class can go up a level. By the way, it is just one more disk that you have to flip through if you decide to replay Baldurs Gate. In conclusion don't buy this EP, it isn't worth it, unless any new EP's come out that require it."
3,They could have done better,"I love this game; it's the best I've played since Ultima IV. But the expansion to Baulder's Gate is rather undeveloped. I think they should've put more plot to it. But the good thing is, I can get my characters to higher level. But there's nothing more to EP other than Durlag's Tower. I'ts not bad overall, but they could've done more with it."
1,Did not like this one,"Did not like this one, it is a cheap copy of Duke Nukem 3d. I think it is a bad copy of it. If you want real fun buy by Duke Nukem instead of this one. I think that the comedy is in the game is crude and stupid."
5,Dark Water makes for a great read,"Linda Hall is one of the best contemporary mystery writers and each year she gets better and better. Dark Water offers far more than a genre novel, though it certainly has mystery galore, danger and some fascinatingly creepy characters. Hall captures voice and paints complex characters with literary precision and great insight. I sure hope to read more about Dark Water's odd couple PI team, who run a whale watching business on the side out of a purple-painted building in fictional Fog Point. Hall's left room for the villain Moon to re-emerge in a subsequent book because he was never caught. AT least I hope that's what she's planning. What an amazing character."
1,It must be me,"Well, since so many others seem to love this game, the reason I don't like it must have something to do with me! I just could not get the hang of it, especially the combat. Maybe if I had devoted a little more time to it, I would have gotten it finally, but I just didn't want to spend all of my time learning how to play - I just wanted to play!Also, I didn't really like the non-linear storyline - I like to have a sense that I am going the right way at the right time. But that's just my personal preference."
2,Why does everyone like this game?,"I used to be a D&D geek. I would rather play any plain old dungeon crawl than this game. Sure it may use the official rules, but this game seems to run as slowly on my PIV 1.3g as it does on my PII 300m. What's up with that? I'm sure Interplay would blame it on both my hardware configurations.Further, I love role playing games as much as the next guy, but why do these people say they're going to use the official rules, and then try to make this game seem like a real-time game. The game is turn-based. Why not leave it at that? You can hit the attack button all you want in Baldur's Gate, but you never know when you're character will actually attack. Am I missing something or does everyone else writing reviews for this game work for Interplay?"
3,Great game but buy the DVD release,"I had this CD version of the game back in 98 when it came out , you had to constantly change CDs when you went between areas which was very frustrating.This is one of the greatest games of all time but 5 CDs that you have to change constantly or 1 DVD you just leave in there all the time is a no brainer."
2,"A great game, but....","If you have an older computer, or lack the appropriate computer skills, this is a beast. Even with the patch, it crashes constantly. Everytime I am just starting to get the hang of the controls, it locks up and shuts down, (usually right before I am about to save my progress). The game play itself is amusing, but there is a lot of walking involved, which if your computer is older or slower, can become pretty tedious."
2,Its starts off great then hits a glass ceiling.,"Maybe it is because I have a Mac version but I was really really enjoying this game when my band of characters stopped going up in experience levels. I contacted the company but was told that that is just the way the game is. Yes, I do like a challenge but I play computer games to relax too and without an advancement in level I don't see how to win this game. I was very very disappointed."
4,To Battle!...,"This game is worth it! Graphics are great story is great, but it needs more characters! And definitely more classes (Ex: Fighter or a Mage) But otherwise this game is great for all RPG (Fantasy) Fans. The only thing to that sets this back from a perfect score...is it's installation. It is way to much for my computer, and it went way to slow that I had a hard time getting through battles with out dying! I dont recommend this game if you have little RAM and Computer Space. Otherwise, this game is for all!"
1,"Push on, push off-doesn't work for me","When I recieved the switch I was excited because I'd used a similar product and loved it. What the sales literature doesn't tell you is that this is a push on/push off switch, not a momentary switch. I was planning on using it to run my drill press and was most interested in it because I thought that it could switch off more quickly than the two push buttons on the drill press itself. No matter how careful you are drill presses occasionly grab the work piece and fling it and I wanted a way to get away from the press and switch it off as quickly as possible. I was expecting the foot switch to work like a deadman switch where the instant I took pressure off the foot controlling it the circuit would be broken and the drill press would stop. Instead, this switch, once acitivated by momentary foot pressure, stays on by itself until you hit the foot pedal again. This requires a much more concious and deliberate action to turn it off rather than a reflexive one."
3,There should have been more pack options,"I have a Fenix, and A Sure Fire flash light. They performed as advertized. However, I needed some extra batteries to have on hand. All that I could see offered was a 2 pack. There should have been 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or even a 12 Pack offered for customers that would have liked to purchase more in a Pack than 2 batteries. Otherwise I am a somewhat satisfied Repeat customer. I recently noticed a Pack of 12 was being offered so I purchased the 12 pack also."
3,Much better... ehh maybe not,"Still wish they were a bit less expensive but they work for much longer then the ""camera"" batteries of the same size that can be found at the big box stores. I do not use my flash light much, I just expect it to work when i need it, and so far for several months that has been the case with my surefire flashlight and these batteries.EDIT: they do not last very long. At least not compared to AA or DD in a MagLite."
5,a hilarious behind-the-scenes account of the '78 Yankees,I bought this book in 1980 and have read it 6 or 7 times since then. A must-read for baseball(especially Yankees) fans.
1,this is a joke right?,"This almbum isn't a tribute, if anything it is a mockery. Absolutely horrible.-a devoted fan"
4,"its not about why, its about why not","one would assume that covering an offspring song can best be compared to spray painting graffiti on disregarded (...), but somehow these bands made it a worthwhile experience. Atlantis Black, whose simmeringly gutteral voice could bring water to a boil in an igloo, makes me actually wonder ""If I've ever..."" and Curtis Suburban's high pitch scream put me into a frenzy that could only be quelled by dumping an entire iced mocha on my crotch...embarassing...yes....necessary....always. this brings me to the Teenage Prayers, whose terrifyingly realistic cover of beheaded put me into a hypnotic trance during which i blacked out and woke up this morning with a running chainsaw in one hand and a picture of my parents in the other. I praise all the bands on this tribute for signing over their material, because god knows the money made from this will have blood on it."
3,Lions and Tigers and...okay...just Tigers,"Rovin, with ""Fatalis"" has created a book that brings back the spirit of the old monster movies. You know the ones...where a creature is frozen and is somehow miraculously revived in modern times and begins to wreak havoc among human beings. In this book, sabre-toothed tigers are the monsters (or is the humans who want to kill them) and they, predictably, start eating their way through California. Fun book but predictable. Nothing new here. Grab some popcorn and relive those monster movie memories."
2,"weak science,hokey ending","the premise-a whole ""herd"" of saber tooth tigers get flash frozen in a cave 10,000 yrs. ago and then the whole ""herd"" gets the thaw treatment from volcanic activity. right. the main hero, a modern day scientist/spelunker/rock climber/indian mystic/ecologist wants to ""save"" the saber tooth cats in the wild by letting loose 2 kittens that aren't weaned yet into a mountain wilderness.Since they are obviously to young to fend for themselves he guranteed their death. some scientist. at least it reads well and is a pleasant diversion if one doesn""t need plausability."
2,It doesn't look like the picture,"The candleholder is ok, has a good size and weight, just not what I expected based off the picture. It does not have as much colored detail as the picture shows, nor does it have a shiny finish. It's actually a dull brassy green color throughout. When I took it out of the package, the circular piece that goes beneath the candle fell off. You could tell that it was because of a bad glue job, so I just glued it back myself. I recieved it VERY timely in good packaging."
4,A sweet little video.,"Debra Bradnum was my ballet teacher when I lived in London. The video is a bit naff but all the girls are sweet and it doesn't attempt anything too hard for small ones to do. It also has footage of the Royal Ballet's Sleeping Beauty. Two of the girls in the video went on to the Royal Ballet School, which is where Debra trained. I would have loved this video had I had it when I was younger."
1,How to be a Ballerina,"I was very dissapointed with the quality of the VHS that I ordered from Amazon.ca. Children cannot learn anything from this tape. The presentation is very poor. As soon as I watched it I was ready to send it back. Unfortunately, Amazon.ca does not accept opened VHS tapes. They accept damaged and unopened items. But what about the products that do not satisfy customers. Because you don't know what you bought, until you open and actually see it. I would not recommend this tape.I ordered two tapes. The other one, ""Discover Bellydance"" (Basic Dance) by Veena and Neena, is an excellent and colourful performace, easy to follow for both children and grown-ups. I would give 5+ stars to this tape."
4,Frigidare FAA084P7A MS II 8000-BTU Room Air Conditioner,"Ease of setup is 5 star. Cooling capacity is better than several 10,000BTU units I have had in the past. The unit is a little noisy at the high setting, but, cools my 196 sq ft room down in less than twenty minutes at which point I switch the fan to low. At low the unit easily maintains it's set temperature and you can turn the tv volume back down to normal. If the unit was a touch quieter at the high fan speed setting, I would have given it a 5 star overall without hesitation. The carrier contacted me immediately, the delivery date was expected to be 7-10 business days, got it on the 3rd day in perfect condition. BRAVO!"
3,Talented Writer Produces Lethargic Novel,"Richard Ford's novel Independence Day seems to careen at a frantic pace when compared to Ms. Phillips tale of several girls at a summer camp. JAP has tremendous talent, but I tired of her Faulknerian sentences combined with strange grammar. Sample: ""Alma playing paper dolls, not sleeping at all, yelling for Kool-Aid, how things seal off for a while behind the pair of them, the two girls."" Ms. Phillips also has to describe everything in complete detail. Entering a men's rest room we find that ""the urinals were a long-necked row of cracked porcelain forms, laced with shadow, supplicant, open-mouthed.""I did find the story interesting; I admired a lot of the writing. Yet I continually worried that the novel would come to a complete halt, and that no existing literary connector cables would be able to jump start it again."
3,Usefull,"This text (translated from the Russian) packs a lot between it's 230 page covers. Ch1: Mechanics of Piezoelectric Materials ; covers constitutive equations, the variational formulation and various solution methods. The authors do not provide detailed proofs ... rather they simply present the results in most cases. Ch2 ; covers a large number of closed form piezoelectric solutions mostly by brief sketch of each solution taken from the literature. The chapter has a large bibliography (about half are Russian publications). Ch3 ; covers magnetic; magnetostrictive transducer and induction heating theory (i have not read this chapter).Although the text seems devoid of new work, it does bring a lot of the literature together and should be usefull for those interested in piezoelectric transducer theory."
2,Does not match medium brown hair,"I ordered this product before and loved it. This time, however, the color doesn't match my hair - it seems to have an obvious red tint and really doesn't look brown. It also made my hair look greasy where I applied it. I wonder if they changed something about this product because it matched well the first time I bought it."
3,Pretty Good Book,"This is a good parakeet ownership book for beginner parakeet owners, but some information seems to be outdated. I had questions after reading the book that were not answered in the text."
2,Got caught by a bargain,"This was a lot of saw for the money so I dove in. Had it a month, used it twice, the fence broke where it clamps to the rail. Bought a 50 inch fence that doesn't shift an eighth to the right when set. Running with dado blades, saw stopped. Wasn't motor. The arbor seized up. Could spin it backwards but not forwards. It tightened like a screw. Maybe there's something I don't know but it seems that that is one thing a table saw should never ever ever do. Unimpressed and worried what's next. Should have spent the extra for the 2hp General."
3,Eh.....it had its moments,"It took me a very long time to get through this book. I purchased it because I thought it would be fascinating to read about other cultures and how they were prepared for the Gospel, but I got really bored about a quarter way through it. I kept having to put the book down and then come back to it later. I even read another book in between reading this book. I agree with another reviewer who stated that the formatting and editing was a little off. Eternity in their Hearts could have been an excellent but I'm afraid it missed the mark. I did however enjoy reading about the alter to an ""unknown God"" the most and how Mr. Richardson told the story about the Apostle Paul and provided the scripture that related to it. I just hated the fact that it took me so long to get through it. There were a few bright moments like the one I mentioned above but overall, it was just OK....more like ""eh."" Read it and then form your own opinion. You may like it much better."
4,Eternity in their hearts,"My son read this book for a book club. He is 14 and really enjoyed it. The first night he started reading it, he came downstairs and proceeded to explain why his dad and I ""must red this book."" A few weeks later he was still drawing connections to the book and sermons at church. After a while he felt that the book did go on a little too long. That perhaps the point could have been made with a chapter or two less. Overall, he is very glad he read the book and would strongly recommend that everyone else read it."
1,They actually published this garbage,"This man is such an idiot!!! I am a college student taking a Vietnam Era class and I have read many books and documents on the different aspects of the Vietnam War most of which are excellent but this by far is absolute junk. The only reason I finished the book was because I had a research paper to do. This book make conjectures that are so far fetched that you can not even argue them because you are too busy scratching you head. A big one that stands out is when he says that the domino theory is not real but then gives you his own version of the domino theory and calls it the ""Bandwagon Theory."" It is astonishing that this book is still printed. I would not even waste your money buying it because you will be scratching you head saying, ""They actually published this garbage."""
3,Through Your Own Lens,"Interesting book. If you think that there was a Soviet-run hegemonic communist world wide movement, you will like the book. If you think this is a huge over simplification, you will find the book absurd. He does seem to gloss over any contradictory information that may weaken his thesis, but it will definitely make you think."
1,Glad I didn't pay for it!,"My son received this as a gift for his 5th birthday. I noticed right away that the toy had a ""warning"" on it not to wind it up more than 1 1/2 times, but kids will be kids (and there's not really a definitive stopping point to the winding), and to make a long story short, the toy never even made it to the pool. He likes to play with the fish, though, but the main piece was in the trash the very first day."
1,VERY old software,"Could not get it to work on a Windows XP box. Although they advertise that it works on XP, the packaging talks about Windows 3.1, 95, etc. - and nothing about XP. I am sure that is because it was created way before XP. Waste of money."
4,Parent4956,Runs on older Windows versions. My son loves it. Beware: WILL NOT RUN ON WIN VISTA 64 Bit -- Believe this is a 16 bit program which VISTA does not support at all (only 32 and 64 bit).
4,Does what it's suppose to,My daughter uses this program at her school and asked that I buy it for home. For the price you get what you pay for. It allows her to make little stories about various subjects (her favorite is Racoons playing football).
5,100% worth the money,"This cd/dvd edition of ""A Beautiful Lie"" is over all my all time favorite album. The dvd has all the extras that fulfill your needs in appreciating their award winning video ""The Kill"". The video, making of the video, live footage, trailers, and and the mind blowing cd is a great buy."
1,Don't bother,One of the worst books I have ever read. Read a glowing review. BAH.Main character not likeable. Nothing good about this book. Did not finish.
1,This is a boring book,"Don't waste your time or money on this book - unless you like to read incredibly dull history. It would turn anyone off history. I would give it zero stars if I could. If you are looking for something along the lines of ""What-If"" or Harry Turtledove - forget it. The authors spend so much time delivering the most trivial facts that they never get down to what might have happened. B-O-R-I-N-G!"
2,Disappointing,"What is the point of writing ""alternative"" history if you spend 90% of the time going over the ""actual"" history? I was pretty disappointed with most of the contributions to this collection. Just accept that ""counter-factual history"" is another version of ""historical fiction"" and run with it. This could have been a lot more interesting...Not recommended."
2,This is about alternate history --- at the meta level --- too rarefied for me,"I knew that Niall would talk about alt history, but I was sore disappointed that he didn't describe or excerpt or analyze any specific examples. I knew he would mention alt history --- but I was dismayed to discover he failed to USE it."
2,Busted.,"The packaging was inadequate for protecting the product during shipping:1) the front cover was broken in three places,2) the condenser cooling coil was mashed in several large areas,3) the air-direction louvers were a joke...Other than these items, it did perform fairly well, after some repair and modifications."
2,"I wanted this to work, but...","I was really hoping this was the answering to the hard water stains in the tub, but no. It is a pretty good cleaning product for light cleaning, as far as I can see. But for those nasty water stains, it just didn't work. I have yet to find a product that can cut through the hard water stains like Zep does and still allow me to breath (I like breathing)."
2,No way to clean it!,"My son is 6 months old now and we have used this product since he was born. It is beautiful and has wonderful features, but there's no way to clean the changing table or the mat that's used for the bassinet/play pen pad. It has been great for diaper changes and naps downstairs. We noticed when it got dirty the first time that the pad on the bottom was not able to be washed because it has what feels like cardboard inside and there is no way to remove the cover. The changing table attachment wipes down easily, but the fabric around and the straps are not removable. I was hoping to use this again when we plan to have more children, but I think I will have to buy another one. I just don't feel comfortable with being able to only spot clean everything! It really is beautiful, but why would anyone make anything for a baby that you cannot wash!? If anyone has found a way to clean this, please let me know!"
1,Looks aren't everything!!!,"While assembling, I had a problem with a defective piece. I called customer service which told me that it would take them 2 to 3 weeks to send me a replacement part. Since they are a small company they don't overnight items even though all customers with problems want the replacement parts sent overnight - there words, not mine. They instructed me to pack up the playpen and return it to the store for a new one.Not wanting to risk getting another lemon I purchesed the Laura Ashley Pack and Play - it was more money but it was well worth not having to deal with the hassel this item gave me."
4,Great So far,"We just purchased this play yard for our first child who has yet to arrive. Besides a little confusion when setting it up (Read the instructions if you've never used one before it will save you loads of time) It looks and works great! I only gave it 4 stars because when you turn on the music/vibration/nightlight, it also turns on 2 VERY bright blue lights on the top of the console which I assume would be to help you see it at night, but if this item were in my bedroom at night there is no way I would be able to sleep. Other then that I think its beautiful and I'm sure out little one will love it to!"
2,So far I'm frustrated!,"I just spent the longest time trying to put this thing together. The instructions were put together terribly and I spent about half an hour trying to find Figure 4 until I realized they made a typo and wrote it as Figure 5. My hands and whole body are sore from putting it together and I had to redo the instructions a few times before I could get it right. Only now am I reading the reviews and see that many people have the same complaint. Wish at this point, even though it is so cute, that I would have gotten something different. I even have to go back to the store to look and make sure I assembled it correctly. BAD INSTRUCTIONS!!"
1,Worst Album of all time,"This Cd gave me Crohns disease after i listened to it, I still have it to this day, the Crohns disease that is. It also caused unemployment to go up because of long haired hippies listening to it over and over again and thinking it was good music so they quit their jobs and decided to start their own awful band---""STEEL"" is just one example. Also, that clown josh smith below is lying through his ass. He was given that cd, he didn't find it in a shop. He also knows 2 memebers of the band and knows what happened to them. What a biased review he gave. Shame. I wouldn't even use the cd booklet as toilet paper if i had none left."
1,HORROR SHOW!!,"My 8 year old son is a pokemon fanatic. So, Santa Claus gave him this. What a horror show. It does not stay together, keeps falling apart, so flimsy a pokemon figure causes it to topple over, pieces of it all over the toy room. It is expensive and really, just an utter piece of junk. What were they thinking when they made this? Did they not test it out? Anyone can plainly see how useless it is. My son now has the new version of the battle dome (although we threw out the lava- waste) which is so much better and stays together. Don't waste your money on this. You would be better off using the box it came in for the battle dome!"
4,A kid's review (and Mom too),"Note from the 8-year-old: The elevator is horrible (Raichu always gets stuck) but the marble shooter is great. The pieces stay together pretty well, but we didn't bother putting on the cardboard pieces since they looked really flimsy. Note from Mom: we knew that this had a 1-star review at the time it went on the Christmas list, my Pokemon fanatic did not care. The original price was ridiculous, but for the $[...] we paid, definitely worth the price for the time my boys have spent playing with it. While the toy itself isn't so hot, it does provide a setting for imaginative play."
1,pokemon battle dome,"I was not impressed with this toy...especially for the price. It requires a lot of assembly and comes apart easily. The playing stage for the battles is not big enough. The elevator does not go up and down easily and the other features, such as the trap door, etc., are too simple."
2,Heart Breaker For Sure! Don't Be Fooled by Pokemon logo!,"There can be no honest good reviews for this item. It is the cheapest, poorest constructed playset we have ever purchased! Common sense must prevail over the useless instructions. There are no parts that easily connect. Actually they don't seem to connect at all. As you put one together 4 more fall off. Unless you plan on using superglue or duct-tape, and then mounting on a shelf for display, then don't waste your money. My son still cries because he got frustrated so many times. He spent more time trying to re-assemble than he did in any enjoyable play."
1,Poorly Made,Our daughter got this for Christmas last year. She played with it until she (and we) got tired of replacing pieces that kept falling off or coming apart every few minutes. Great idea in theory; poorly made.
1,Pokemon Disaster Dome,"This product would be great for my Pokemon loving son! I bought this for him to get away fom video games and use his imagination some.He won't play with it because the stupid thing keeps falling apart!! The product comes with pictures on the side you attach with double sided tape. Ever seen tape stick to textured plastic? The ""feet"" come off the bottom, you can't move it without it coming apart. the dome is 2 halves and you put the stickers on...Mine are wrinkled because it is like putting a long sticker inside a bowl.....The red dome (2 pieces) comes apart too when you move the product around in the room, the ""WINNER!"" flag won't stay on.If you want to tape the whole thing together to stay it might work, but come on....Wish I had bought an imaginext product instead of spending the $50 on the darn dome!!!!!"
5,GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS WAS SUCH A GOOD BOOK I READ IT IN LESS THAN THREE HOURS.THIS STORY IS ABOUT A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD CATHERINE AND TWENTYTWO YEAR OLD DERRIC. IT IS FULL OF LONGING AND COMPASSION. THEN LOVE. WITH ENTHRALLING MOMENTS OF BATTLE AND DESEPTION THIS IS ANOTHER GREAT AVON BOOK IN THE SERIES.
4,Adventure and Romance,"This book was as good as i hoped it would be, though i didn't like how Catherine cried so much! It took me by surprise when i started liking the shipmates better than i did her. They were funny and likable. The adventure in the book was exciting, and the romance was well written. Overall i thought it was a good book."
4,Charming Little Romance,"While the title promises a pirate, that's really a misnomer for Derrick St. John, hero of the novel. Catherine, a young woman of prominent family is thrown together with the hero ... pirate when her brother is kidnapped and she needs a ship to Charleston to save him. The expected romantic misunderstandings take place with neither party revealing their feelings until the end after they have saved Catherine's brother with a little high seas action in the process.Not bad as young adult romances go, the continued enforced guilt of Derrick got a little old after a while. Yes, he'd been a pirate once, but get over it. Catherine was your typical perfect heroine, pretty and brave and stubborn, with little personality.While the book was the usual fair from this genre, it was a good effort and more enjoyable than most which is why it got a higher rating than I would normally give. Maybe that and that I'm [crazy] for pirates."
2,So so,"Although the product is great and I love the size, the shipping is waaaaaay too expensive.I can buy two of these from Whole Foods with the amount of money spent on shipping, tax and handling. Go figure!"
3,Not Bad,"This book is not exactly what I expected and the old school PHP in conjunction with PEAR is a major pain. I have spent the better half of 6 months reworking the entire script to work with PHP5 and no PEAR extensions. I did find the book somewhat helpful, just not exactly what I was looking for. I wish someone would right a really good mmorp game book that would be beneficial to todays standards. All in all though not a bad book. I did learn a few things that has helped me to move forward in PHP game programing. Which is good because I was getting tired of just using Flash."
5,Great product- hard to find,"This is a great product, hard to find because their nemesis, Just For Men, has come out with a new line that has wound up elbowing Grecian out of the store shelves. Just For Men long ago watered down and effectively ruined what had been a good product, but they are muscling Grecian out of the store aisles. Amazon was the only place I could find it."
3,"Made the Grade: Imperia series, Book 1","3 out of 5 stars. I had such hopes for this book. *sigh* I mean it was good .... but around chapter 19 or so I was getting sick of Katie, who kept running away from her feelings just because she never believed what he said. I just wanted to smack her. But this book did make me laugh ... cry ... smile .... and it had a great ending!Review By: From Me to You ... Book Reviews(read more of this review and a teaser on my blog)"
2,Couldn't finish-She's written much better books,"I got bored very quickly with this book. The premise was interesting and intrigued me, but the story just didn't hold me. The hero was too arogant and up himself, and the heroine all over him like a rash. Gena has written much better books, ie Lords of the Underowrld."
3,WOMEN KISSING STATUES........HUM???,"Hi everyone I'm 15 and my Dad said that since I read the book I could rate it. The book was OK up until the end. Without givingthings away. The lead female had alot of sex with the lead male once she got going. She knew something bad would happen to him if she didnt do something. Yet she kept having sexbut didnt do this something. I guess she had to be somewhat stupid in order to forgive others. When things were resolved, the lead female said to the lead male you must ravish me once aday. I think it was more LUST than love."
4,Excellent High Seas Adventure,"""All the Brothers Were Valiant"" is a straight forward adventure film, highly entertaining with a lean narrative that expedites the story.The acting, by everyone, is good for its time and the overall look of the film is richly textured and romantic. The presentation of life on a whaling ship is far removed from the realities of whaling ships, according to history, but that's what literary or cinematic romance is all about.I agree with the U.K. reviewer regarding Betta St. John as the native girl.I find many MGM films from the early 50s to be notoriously dull, but ""All the Brothers Were Valiant"" is escapist entertainment at its finest."
3,It's a little noisy...,"It's a lot of fun except for the noise problem. We aren't able to play this game for more than 20 minutes without the sound going birzerkers! A horrible sound starts that covers all the dialogue. I have tried multiple times to get support from the vendor, but can't get through. If I could find the fix for this problem, I'd rate the game at 5 stars. Maybe it's because it's an old game and we have a new PC."
4,Always replace these when replacing brake shoes!,"One of the cables on my 1994 Explorer had snapped from age, so my front discs were not getting an assist from my rear drums. Make sure to replace these, as well as the spring/hardware kit!"
4,Looking for a guilt-free reason to read a romance novel?,"This is one romance novel you won't have to disguise or hide from your friends while you read it. ""Truly Inseparable"" is a wonderful departure from the ""bodice ripper"" / melodramatic, overblown romance stories you know from days of old. Up-to-date, realistic story and characters with heart, ""Truly Inseparable"" by Wanda Thomas lures you in with an attractive cover, mini-hardback format and a dynamite opening. A little warning though, be prepared to care about Shelby and Nelson as people, (I caught my husband reading it to find out why I had a bit of a cry). We both highly recommend this book, and look forward to Ms. Thomas's next."
2,"Amped: How Big Air, Big Dollars and a New Generation Took Sp","Basically Mr. David Brown decided to try and get a slice of the pie of extreme sports by writing a [...] version of how cool being 'X'-treme is.This guy has no idea what he is talking about and his views on inline skating show that. Maybe he should do some research into a broad range of sports instead of focussing on skateboarding and beating it like a dead horse. I would rather watch TV than buy this book. I especially like how Mr. David Brown hopes to make a quick buck off of kids who skateboard, watch the X-games, and envy Tony Hawk. The publisher of this book should be ashamed for allowing such (...)to filter into the marketplace."
3,"Funny, sad, a great read for a true dog lover.","Loved this book, the language techniques and visual imagery were fabulous and gave me more insite to the areas in which is was written about. To think Red Dog belonged to everybody and was quite nomadic is wonderful, we should love and accept people like we do our four legged animals. So sad he died but what a wonderful life he had. Fabulous book, not deep, an easy read - great in between book."
2,See the movie,After seeing (and thoroughly enjoying) the movie I was excited to read the book to get a more in debth look at the characters. However at just 115 pages I don't feel like I got nearly as much from the book as I did from just seeing the movie. This is odd because it's usually the other way around. Anyway the book seemed to do a disservice to a delightful story by compressing it into such a short novel. I'd advise on just getting the DVD.
5,Great Video,"This is a great video, because each session goes by so quickly, and each 15 minute mile targets different parts of your body and/or different speeds."
3,good but could be improved,"As a overall workout I like this DVD however I would like to customize it before starting instead of stopping to move around the menu.I like how Biggest Loser lets you selected which parts of the workout you want and set it up before you start, hopeful Leslie will consider this in the future, As I am sure I will keep building my library of her workouts."
2,"Poor Quality-Amazon replaced, but 2nd one is bad too","The workout video is a great video, but the quality is poor. I sent back the first video which Amazon replaced, but the second one is bad, too. I tried it on the DVD player where I exercise to my other DVDs and it froze. It continued to get worse, so I tried it on another DVD player and it works for now. I really like Leslie Sansome and her workouts. It's too bad that the quality isn't better."
5,A Rave,Just love it! It is convenient to use especially when the weather is inclement and outside walking not possible.
5,getting out of the slump,"have been struggling with my weight and mobility. Used to love dancing and had a baby later in life (am 41) really had a hard time with the pregnancy and getting back in shape. Leslie is very encouraging and I find her sincere and sweet rather than 'over the top' like other videos. simple, easy to follow and gets your heart rate up. great to get you started. I'm enjoying the dvd. great for rainy days that you can't get outside."
3,5 day slim down,"This one is just okay for me. It's a little disjointed, and the warm up is too slow for my liking. Otherwise it's another of Leslie Sansone's miracle walks! I'd suggest this one for the out of shape beginner -- it's gentle and simple."
4,Good basic workout,I bought this because my VCR finally died and I could no longer do the 4 Leslie Sansone workouts I had and loved. This one wasn't bad although I do prefer when she has other people working out with her. This one was just a solo Leslie for all the miles. I didn't feel like the arms and stomach ones did much work on my arms or stomach. I did like the legs section. Overall though it's a good basic walking workout. I would suggest pairing this with a toning workout.
1,Beg to differ,"I bought this for my kids because of the sterling reviews (at the time 5*, 3 people). I'm not that picky or sophisticated but neither I nor my kids (age 4) like it.Problems:- voices were amatuerish compared with other kid CDs(some high notes very sour)- accordian accompaniment(enough said)- childrens' voices singing holiday love songs. To me itjust doesn't make a good mix to hear smallchildren singing about grownup topics.- majority of the songs were non religious(obviously a matter of personal preference)A lot of people cited liking this out of nostalgia. I too remember fondly ""All I want for Christmas was my 2 front teeth"", however this rendition just didn't live up to my memories.If you want a lovely Christmas CD sung by children, look up""Frosty"" on Amazon. It's sung by the International Childrens'Choir and it's good!"
1,Poor,"There are many introductory texts on philosophy available and I urge the prospective reader to stay away from this one. The section on Nietzsche is appallingly bad and does no justice to his thought whatsoever. If you are an intelligent person and want a good introduction to philosophy then look no further than Bryan Magee's books, also available on Amazon."
1,Good overview but it fell short of strategic implications,"I liked the intention of the writer, which was to give an overview of the industry. However, the book lacked the following: information on real statistics, a global view, graphics and diagrams, and profile on suppliers, vendors, carriers, regulators and users(very little). Mr. Schneiderman found space to talk about the Oklahoma and NY's WTC bombing and not about more substantial information."
5,rachmaninov at best!,this is the best recording of rachmaninov piano concertos ever! who can play or interpret rachmaninov better than the composer himself?
1,not worth buying !,"Streeter wrote this book to impress other professors only. The target of this book is for lecturer, not for college students."
5,Delightful!,"This has always been my favorite of Grace Livingston Hill's many titles, and I'm so glad Barbour Publishing is re-releasing her work. The Christmas Bride is heartwarming, encouraging, full of hope, and perseverance."
5,Best headcover ever,"Absolutely beatiful headcover. Exactly as pictured, seems very durable and well constructed. So much better looking than any other NCAA mascot headcovers on the market. Only fault is it doesn't fit my 460cc driver but would def work well on drivers with smaller club heads. Currently protecting my 3 wood.."
1,Little value for the money,"The software is priced too high for the little value it provides. Unless you subscribe directly to the research sites that are available within the application, you will have to manually enter your research information into the product. Ironically, I couldn't manage to import research from InfoTrac (made by the same company) into EndNote. Furthermore, the software DOES NOT RUN ON XP SP2! After installing the service pack, I found that EndNote would crash whenever editing a research library. There isn't much help on Gale's site except for a small blurb about how the software doesn't run on XP SP2 and to not install SP2. Lazy programming all around."
4,Shows moths in a new light! :),"Yes, finally! A quality book on the true beauty of moths! I always liked moths (particularly the beautiful silkmoths), so I really wanted to have this book. It provides good information on moths as well as how to photograph them (which was one of my primary reasons for getting this book). The only issue I have, though, is that I wish it had more pictures of some underappreciated beauties."
3,"70's Style Garage Band ""Rock en Espanol""","The raw energy that this band puts into their proformances is likened to Foghat, Bad Company, and early Led Zepplin. The genre of Rock en Espanol has come into it's own with the help of these early 70's bands. La Secta has a hold of the strings, they have tapped into the engery that hits you in the heart and pumps your blood. Let's just hope that with the success that this and other albums will surly give them, that they don't ""SELLOUT"". Good Luck GuysPEACE"
2,Not pleased,I purchased this for use while recovering from a hysterectomy. It does provide a higher easier to use seat. I was disgusted to discover that urine had run down the inside of the seat and down the front of the toilet and onto the rug. Not a good thing to have to deal with while recovering from surgery.
4,Excellent Raised Seat; Cleaning-careful,"I had hip replacement surgery and it was necessary to have a raised toilet seat installed at home. After raising toilet lid/seat, it was very easy to install this item. HINT: Take a toilet lid cover and put over the raised lid/seat--makes it very comfy. This seat is excellent and very sturdy. I would recommend it to anyone needing for that purpose!When cleaning, make sure you are able to rinse it thoroughly. I kept detecting a 'smell' - when I removed it and shook it, water somehow was inside of it!"
4,very prompt service,I ordered 2 weeks before Christmas and expected a delay. To my delight it arrived in 6 days including a weekend.The product was also first class.
4,"Quality product, very stout, cook time changes","This is a very good pan, very well made of fairly high gauge stainless steel. I switched from an aluminum roaster to this pan. The first roast chicken took about 30 minutes longer than expected (compared to aluminum pan). I think the stainless tends to reflect, rather than pass the heat somewhat. The sides of this unit are also fairly tall. Both seemed to contribute to the longer cooking time. Not a problem - you just need to be aware that the cooking time may change. I have also made pan gravy using the pan on the stove-top. Very happy with the product."
5,Great Product; Great Shipping,"I'm a novice, so take my review with a ""pinch of salt."" However, I am pleased with my recent purchase. The product was delivered quickly and turned out to be exactly what I expected. I have only used the pan once, but it worked great! My first roast came out wonderfully, and the juices were very easy to clean off the bottom and the rack."
3,"Good, but I was expecting better","This is a good, well-made, inexpensive roasting pan. I would highly recommend it, except that it's too thin for my tastes.When making gravy, if you don't watch the pan very carefully, it will burn. This is primarily because the bottom is so thin that it doesn't distribute heat very well, so you get hotspots.I'm also not fond of the rack handles... too close to the pan handles and liable to fall inwards when moving the pan. I've burned myself once when pulling the pan out of the oven: now I'm much more careful.On the other hand, those two caveats aside, this is an excellent pan."
5,A fun story.,"Jamie's wife leaves him for a week and all he has to do is keep the house clean: not a small challenge for the messiest man in Ireland - and the laziest. A magical pooka may be able to help - or perhaps not, in this fun story."
3,Informative,"I have been on a college search with my daughters for a little over a year. I have come to the conclusion that this book is overrated and I just take the information for what it is, just information. I have purchased all of the major books and this one is middle of the road."
3,Errors - ??,"An earlier edition of Linda Page's ""Healthy Healing"" has been one of my go-to books for years; I bought this edition because the earlier one has literally fallen apart from use. The 12th edition is truly a wealth of information, but after reading (pg 155)that ""3. Sea salt is a rich source of iodine...."", then a little further down on the same page ""...Sea salt contains no iodine...."", I wondered how well this edition had been checked for accuracy and what other information might be contradictory."
5,Used remedies in this book and most really work,"I have been using Linda Pages book for many years. It has been very helpful and I find that most of her advice really works. I have given many books as gifts. It's nice to have a book like this around for emergencies. Has a whole section on kid's health and animals health as well. For those people who think that her book is just an advertisement for her products...maybe, but I have never bought any of her products and I've used the information in the book many, many times. She actually gives many different product lines in her book and I think she gives things that have proven to work. I think her motivation for the book is to give accurate information. If she has made remedies for some of the illnesses she details in her book, good for her. I think she's great."
4,Healthy Healing: A guide to Self-Healing for everyone,The information given in this book is very informative and easy to follow. Sources for products are also very accessible. guidelines for using this book are simple and very easy to understand.
2,My husband said...,He is an avid reader of lLouis L'Amour for years now. He wanted to try Lauren Paine's books. He said this one has too many characters and i confusing.
2,This game made me so mad!,"When you play this game, be aware, you may end up slaming your controller on the ground. In one level, you work very hard to go up a tree and it is so easy to fall. The things you have to do in the levels have NOTHING, AND I MEAN NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MOVIE! When you get a token or fifty coines,you cet a chance to go the next level(they ask you yes, or no.) If you accidently pick no, they don't ask ""are you sure,"" so you don't get another chance to exit the level, unless you beat another of their ""missions,"" whice seriously TEST YOUR PATIENCE!Activision, remember Toy Story on Sega Genesis? That was fun. This isn't."
2,HAIER 6K AIR CONDITIONER,"Price and efficiency are average-or better. My negative opinion is because(1) I find the unit noisey compared to several other units I have, but(2) my biggest complaint is that it regulates very badly: it's solid state/remote control with a readout(nice features), but if I set it at 72 or 74F, it will cool down to at least 64 - 66 before shutting down the compressor- way too much swing under my desired setting. By comparison, two other window units from other manufacturers usually won't vary by more than 3 degrees. I intend to replace this unit very quickly, and hopefully, recover a fraction of the cost on craigslist....."
3,Thai pocket dictionary,"Maybe its small size is a plus, but when in Thailand, but I frequently found it lacking when I tried to use it."
2,Very disappointed,"I purchased the Pocket Thai Dictionary and the Phrase Book by Periplus and was very disappointed in both of them. They are both very basic and are for very beginning students only. I wish I'd spent a little more money and purchased better, more comprehensive books."
5,Even better than the EMI version!,"This recording shows Maria Callas at her very best; dramatic, emotive and often beautiful singing throughout. The supporting cast is fine. Unlike the EMI issue of this live recording, this Opera D'oro set does not have a libretto, which is unfortunate as it is unlikely that an opera fan will have very many recordings of this rare opera, however, this edition has better sound than the EMI set, clearer and better focused.This would make an excellent companion set to the Suliotis, Sutherland or Sills studio recordings as this is the most dramatic and moving of any versions available on CD in my opinion, although it cannot compete with the excellent sound on those recordingsVery Highly Recommended"
1,"Blues it isnt,noise and not much moore!","Very dissapointed.programmed, no feeling,not blues at all, in my opinion. Save your money,there are plenty of great other new releases out. The worst release that I ever bought,and with over 700 in my collection that should give it some weight(dead). Jason Mcdale"
4,Works for a season,"This is an exact replacement used in my humidifier used only during the winter months (3 months or so). I have gone through one of these each year in my Hunter humidifier. By the end of winter, there is usually some buildup from minerals in water, and it smells a bit funky. Tried cleaning with bleach, but it doesn't help much."
3,its ok,it works ok. it is somewhat uncomfortable. the size i ordered seems too small. it does not seem to fit correctly.
4,Easy to follow and a good workout!,"I recently tried Pilates for the first time using this DVD. I found it to be a good workout and easy to follow. I am in my early 50's and in relatively good shape - not overweight, but not getting enough exercise! This DVD has helped with that. The only comment I would make is that you may have to slightly modify some of the moves at first because it is not possible to do them precisely as shown, but just do the best you can! I omitted the exercises that require rocking on your back, because it hurt my tailbone. I just don't do those at all. But, it is a good way to get in shape from the comfort and convenience of your own home."
5,Pilates Instructor Who Loves this DVD,I love this DVD! The exercises are perfect for the beginner to intermediate student. The verbal instructions are very well done letting you know what you should be feeling and where. The exercises are clearly shown and easy to follow. I attended a Pilates Body workshop with Brooke Siler in March 2008 and she is just as wonderful to workout with on this DVD as she was in person. And the background scenary is beautiful. Buy it! You'll love it.
3,Disappointed,A bit disappointed with DVD. Thought it would be more slow pace since it stated that it was for beginners. I haven't exercise for while and this video seemed to be designed more for people who exercise often.
4,challenging,I like this video because the moves are different from all my other Pilate's Dvds so it challenges me and makes me feel like I'm working muscles that haven't been worked in a while.
4,Piliates for Beginners,I have done pilates for the last several years via dvds.I was very bored in the one that I have been using due to the repetition. Ordered Pilates Weight Loss Pilates by Element. This DVD is one I can not recommend for beginers only for fact it should be classified more for the Intermediate. Have tryed this dvd twice and I had to grid my teeth every time I sat and my legs burned for weeks. I am going to do it agian today hoping It will not make as sore as before...I sure hope not. I can see how a person could get really be fit if they master the exercises on this dvd.
2,Not great for true beginners,I thought these were very challenging exercises and not well suited for beginners. She moves quickly with lots of instruction and very little modification.
2,I returned it and went digital,"We are headed on vacation in a couple of weeks and I thought it would be a good time to get a lightweight compact camera. I had heard good things about the elf, and although I hadn't ever tried APS film I thought this would be a good time. I shot 3 rolls of film, in all kinds of lighting conditions. I tried indoors, outdoors, sunny days, after dark and cloudy days. I have to tell you that repeatedly it felt like the pictures were over-exposed. The elf's ability to balance exposure to suit a setting really goes haywire when it has to balance higher contrast. The red-eye feature didn't work so swell, and my pictures just weren't up to par. We are returning it and going digital. I bought the digital elf and shot several shots, printed them and they give me the pictures, color and resolution I am looking for. I think this little camera was a bit overhyped."
5,Great purchase,"If you are considering a regular Canon Elph, go with the 370Z instead: its powerful zooming capability is well worth the extra. For such a small, lightweight camera, its picture clarity is remarkable (even when you enlarge the prints). I took it as my only camera on a trip to Europe, and ended up with photos that compared favorably to professional postcards. I've had this camera for a year and haven't regretted it for a moment. I keep it in my purse for all those moments when people say, ""I wish we had a camera with us!"" If you are new to APS cameras, you will love the easy system of index prints and not having to handle negatives. The handiest camera I've ever owned."
4,Canon Elph 370Z,"Small camera, very slimlined and easy to carry. I purchased refurbished and everything is working perfectly. I only wish the zoom was a little stronger, but overall an excellent camera."
5,My Two year old Daughter loves it!,"The box was a bit crushed, but the puzzle was not damages. My daughter and I had fun putting it together several times one evening. What can you say about a puzzle, the large floor size with big pieces are easy for little fingers to manipulate. I'm sure this puzzle will see years of use."
3,Very Cute and Frustrating-,"This game has tons of nice graphics and the overall idea of it is good. On the other hand I don't know how a child would ever be able to beat this game. I am 26 and I had trouble with it. My son and I had to go online to get hints on how to advance in this game after the 5th level. Some parts of this game were so frustrating and monotonous that I had a strong desire to throw the t.v. out of the window at times. Finally I beat it, but long after being driven crazy for hours. The guide book (or insert) that comes with the game doesn't provide much help either. I would say that it's 40% great and 60% frustration. Poor kids....."
5,One of the Two Best GTA Games out there,"This game has always been a favorite of mine, from the Tommy Vercitte Mansion modeled after Tony Montana'a Mansion to the great story line all in all this is not a game for kids no but it still a phone for anyone vivid GTA fan to play."
3,worth the few bucks,"I still ended up buying the Chilton. But this was toatlly worth the few bucks, as I do my most of my own repairs and upkeep. It is the basics, which everyone should know- thus far more simple then the chilton. It covered most all years YJ,TJ."
4,Adequate and Functional,"The nickel finish on this mirror is not highly attractive, but looks okay in my bathroom. I recently had back surgery and my physical therapist recommended I purchase a mirror like this to save myself from having to lean over the counter when I apply my makeup. I priced mirrors like this in the stores and they were outrageous. For the price, this mirror seems sturdy enough, is fully functional, and will alleviate strain on my back. I would purchase it again. It was also delivered in a lot less time than expected."
1,Mirror arrived minus a Bushing,"This Jerdon First Class 7X to 1X Mirror arrived minus a needed bushing in order for it to swivel sideways and hold its position properly. We called the company immediately and they said they would send us the missing part. This was about 4 weeks ago. We have recieved nothing. We have mounted the mirror, but it doesn't hold any sideways positions. Otherwise we are satisfied with the mirror. If it had the missing bushing it would be worth the price."
1,Scissor way too tight,Scissor mechanism is very tight and requires too much force to adjust mirror. I tried some light oil but no luck. I had to return it.
5,Great Anti-Virus Software,"I am running Windows XP Home Edition on 2GHz machine, and I have been debating for months whether to switch from McAffee 7.0 to PC-Cillin. Well, I finally did and I wish I had done it sooner. The list of positives goes on and on. Competitively low price, extremely easy install, light on system resources, and no annoying pop-ups. I also have a laptop that came pre-intalled with McAffee 8.0 and I hated the annoying pop-ups. There was no way to turn off the ""Your virus definitions have not been updated recently"" pop-up even though I had specified that I would manually update the virus definitions when I felt they were need (It's a laptop without a wireless connection and when I am not connected to the internet I do not plan on updating my definitions, a concept that McAffee doesn't seem to understand). But enough ranting about McAffee, if you are looking for a straight forward anti-vius program than this is the product for you."
1,Stick with McAfee or Norton,"At first, I thought it was great too. My computer seemed to be virus-free, and even thought the updates took forever because I am on dial up, I wasn't too worried.Then it went downhill, a virus got through. Ok, I thought, these things happen. I was not too happy about the 8 hours it took to fix my machine and get everything cleaned & reset up.Then another virus got past the firewall, not so much as a bleep. The computer was scanned by Micro Trend and it showed no virus. There was NO doubt that there was a virus on the machine and after doing a little research on-line I found it was an older virus (from 2002 I think), so my Micro Trend should have had the virus definition for it & should have found it.I uninstalled Micro Trend and installed McAfee. McAfee found 7 viruses/infected files (including the referenced virus above)!!! SEVEN!!!Needless to say, my computer runs much faster & better now.I will not be installing or purchasing anything else by Micro Trend."
3,Adequate overview of early windpower industry.,"The author did a good job of explaining how the wind energy industry in America got it's start in California, the start-up troubles, and the key issues important to making wind energy a viable alternative energy source. On the downside, I thought the book included too much information, and sometimes left the reader wondering how certain sideline stories fit in with the rest of the book. There were so many people mentioned & referenced, that I couldn't keep up with who did what when."
3,best boxing since activision,"This game has the intensity and action of the first boxing game for activison. The graphics are good, the motions are good, but the game itself can not catch the players interest. It is a average game and I would rent it before buying."
2,"Stargate Atlantis, seasons 1 & 2","The items arrived on time. Unfortunately Season 1 DVD was not very good; could not access one of the episodes after many tries. Season 2 also was difficult to access. Not too pleased with items, but not Amazon's fault.Linda Sheean"
3,whats the catch?,"I've owned 3 pairs of these.The soles are marking. If you stomp on something or drag your feet, you will leave dark thick black marks.The toe likes to come unglued from the sole. I reccomend shoe goo.The leather, if it can be called such, is coated with plastic of some sort. It's not spit shineable.The boots are decently light and somewhat wearable."
2,No sole or arch support,"The price cannot be beat, but expect to get what you pay for. The soles of my feet were hurting after climbing over lots of rocks with these boots. Also, did not appreciate getting unsolicited junk mail afterwards!"
3,Decent. Book,"Book had good information, didn't actually little content. Worth the money I spent, not that much info & should e more."
4,Very informative book,"I think Meet the Stars of Sweet Valely High was very informational and tells fans all they wanted to know about their favorite actor/actress.It gives you information from what the stars fave foods are to who is their fave football team. It also includes great pics of the cast.I would suggest buying the book, only if you're an avid fan, because any other person wouldn't appreciate it the way die-hard fans would.And keep watching SVH!"
3,"3 Stars for this Edition, 5 Stars for the Color version","As usual, Gaiman knows how to deliver the goods, and his stories haven't ever looked better than when Michael Zulli is drawing them.If this was a first chance to see this story, I'd have been pretty well pleased. But this is a reprint from an earlier publication and it is in Black and White (or more peculiarly, brown and white).If you can get the original printing, the colors were lovely. They are less so with this edition.Negatives asides, this is an excellent story. The tie-in with Alice Cooper only made me want to buy AC music (which I did and remembered that I'm not a fan of AC at all) and go find that theater. Very cool stuff"
1,too disconnected,"tried to read this but could not stay interested in it, tried several times. I've been to China and wanted to enjoy it, but the story ping pongs around, maybe something was lost in the translation. Or, maybe you have to be Chinese to grasp it. The sexual references were very crude, I tried but gave up after 50 pages."
4,My go to practice.,"I enjoy Elena's approach to yoga. Very peaceful, thorough and spiritual. She just says the right thing at the right time to make you go that little bit further that makes a difference."
4,Calm and relaxing,"This is a calm, basic yoga video with a morning section and an evening section. It's a great way to start out the day or wind up an evening. It's good for stress relief and gently stretching out. The setting is nice and the instructor is pleasant. Not my favorite yoga video, but it's nice, and appropriate for a beginner."
4,Good for beginners or re-starters,"I haven't done yoga in a few years, not that I was ever advanced, so it was nice to get back into it. This was a good introduction, it had alot of basic poses, a nice background and a knowledgeable instructor. I do wish there were shorter versions of the work outs available on the DVD. I'm not a morning person, so I don't think I'll be getting up early on work days to do 30-40 minutes of yoga, maybe I'll fit it in on weekends. Also, the instruction is done in a voice over, I prefer when the instructors actually talk to you while doing it, but that's just me. Overall, I think it's a solid place to start or re-start if you're thinking about it."
5,Good for beginners,"This DVD has good routines, and is definitely geared towards beginners or those who prefer a more slow-moving yoga practice. I personally prefer to continue moving rather than holding poses while listening to the instructor talk. But it was very relaxing, and overall provided nice routines."
4,Gentile Inspiring way to greet and finish out your day,"I purchased this DVD with a little trepidation, as I've never been very good at Yoga. As soon as I put the DVD in I began to feel a little better, as the instructor, Elena Brower, introduced the program and explained the purpose of the different segments.The AM section does exactly what it claims, incorporating movement between various poses to add a small bit of aerobic exercise in. By the end of the AM section I felt charged and fully awake.I would recommend this DVD to anyone looking to add Yoga into their fitness routine."
2,a very limited view,"this book was very disappointing, it is a very limited point of view written for a committed male/female couple and no one else, also only talks about ""domestic discpline"" not really about the BDSM mindset. I really didn't learn a thing from this about truely creating a scene and understanding your sub."
5,Great service,I want to tell you first of all that when I ordered this program I made the mistake of not specifying what platform. I didn't realize that I was suppose to order for the pc and that it was advertising for the playstation. When I received it I got a playstation version. The people at this company are so caring that I sent it back after calling them and even though they didn't advertise for the pc version they located one in their back stock and sent it to me immediately. What service!!!!!
4,Simple Music Creation,"I fell in love with this game because of its simple interface. Memorize a few button presses and you can be putting songs together in no time. Pick from hundreds of melodies, bass lines, drum parts, sound effects, and percussion samples and paste them together to make a song. It's that easy. You can even create your own riff if you've got the patience for it. Then you can even create your own music video to along with your song.This game did not recieve as much attention as it should have, but I strongly reccomend it. The only two flaws are the slowdown that occurs from time to time, especially during the video editing, and the songs take up an enormous amount of space on your memory cards."
1,Listen FIRST,"I stumbled onto Tom Arico through Mp3.com's bulletin boards where he was extolling the virtues of the Iraq war effort and condemning the dangers of liberal thought. I listened to a few of the songs from his ""Live from Jerusalem"" album there on Mp3.com and, when I was amazed by what I heard, googled him, discovering that he's been discovered by enthusiasts of 'outsider music' and, following their suggestions, I eventually found this page.There are many glowingly exultant 5 star reviews of Tom Arico here -- and you may ultimately agree with them. Or, perhaps you'll agree with the buyer from London who lamented her foolishness in believing those glowing reviews at face value.At any rate, I STRONGLY SUGGEST that, before you spend your money, you listen to some of his music...I found it, well, let's say, highly entertaining (but couldn't in all conscience give it anything but the star rating above.)"
4,Good CD for childrens choir at church!,We are singing from this CD at my church for Christmas this year. I am the Director for the childrens choir and will use amazon again to purchase music.
5,Truly Amazing,"Just when you thought there was nothing new to say about Japanese popular culture, this incredible book rolls off the presses. Riding the ""dorama"" wave within anime and manga fandom, the authors have opened up an entirely new area in Japanese media studies. Very few cultures have such guides to their TV available -- only the USA, the UK and Brazil have any comparable volumes in existence. The introduction is particularly interesting, demonstrating the earth-shattering effects of the English-language broadcasting industry -- simply by being five years ahead after the war, the USA came to dominate the style and practise of Japanese TV. Superman becomes Ultraman, the Westerns become samurai dramas, and, amazingly, one of the most influential TV shows in Japan *today* is still the all-but-forgotten American ""Thirtysomething"". An incredible window into the way that English-language culture is transformed when viewed through the eyes of another nation."
3,So Delicious...,This product arrived at a moderate pace... Warning... Do not order this in the summer... It melts rapidly!!!!
1,DO NOY BUY THIS CAMERA,"This camera looses when you put in a new roll of film. And, it happened to me with two seperate Cannon Elph's. The display shows a flashing ""H"" and you can't take any pictures. In the manual it says you just have to take the battery out to fix this problem. Most of the time the film gets ruined and when you take the battery out the date get reset. I would not buy another Elph camera. It irks me that Canon obviously knew about this problem when they put the camera on the market (since they describe it in their manual) but chose to sell a defective product.Thanks Megan"
5,Language,"Just wanted to clarify one thing as so many of you seem to be getting it wrong. Albert Sànchez Piñol wrote Cold Skin (""La pell freda"" in Catalan, not Spanish. His new novel ""Pandora al Congo"", which I think is also being translated into English, was written in Catalan as well."
4,"amphibious monsters, survival, and sex",This story is unique and unusual and I wasn't entirely sure what to make of it but I liked it. A man is trapped on an island with amphibious creatures that attack nightly and he ends up kidnapping and falling in love with one of them. This builds to a dramatic and satisfying conclusion.
1,Spit is cheaper and just as effective,"I tried this after using Cerama Bryte, but this stuff doesn't do anything that water won't do. It's runny and has no ability to clean any problem areas whatsoever."
1,No Good,"Don't let the brand ""Easy-Off"" fool you. This is nowhere near as effective as the oven spray. It's more like Soft Scrub...just more expensive."
1,"""Easy Off""? - NOT !!!",Picked this up at my local store because they didn't stock our usual brand.Had no idea that stove top cleaners required a consumer review comparison but boy was I wrong. This product deserves ZERO stars. Took twice as much time and elbow grease and the end result was inferior. Lots of smears and complete areas that weren't clean in addition to dry flakes from the product itself.I'll be getting a refund ASAP!!!
5,Outstanding release!,"Wonderful news from the DGG vaults. Many of us Wagner lovers are familiar with this cherished production from previous incarnations. But this reincarnation on DVD brings out everything to new life and new focus. Outstanding interpretations from Cheryl Studer as Elsa and Gabriele Schnaut as Ortrud. A little less so the Lohengrin of Paul Frey but we have heard much much worse in recent times. Gorgeous, naturalistic production and staging. No Regietheater or Eurotrash here. It is like balm for the eyes, ears and soul. Again. All in all, this is THE Lohengrin to own. Thank you, DGG. Question for DGG: how much longer before you release on DVD the treasured Bayreuth TANNHAEUSER with Maestro Sinopoli, Studer and others?"
2,You get what you pay for,"After buying a dozen or so contemporary Kindle books that were under $3, I'm going to stop buying these cheap books. Dirty Pool was like the others I bought, not worth reading. In fact, I'm going to stop buying Kindle books until the price of popular books is reduced significantly. There's no reason why a Kindle book, or any ebook, should cost almost as much as a hard copy. The true savings in the printing and distribution of ebooks will need to be reflected before I buy any more Kindle books."
5,Praise our Father in Heaven with these dynamite songs,"Every song on Steve's cd, I have no doubt, has touched the heart of God. The melodies and lyrics are so beautiful. They work together to bring the listener into a closeness with God. And, if that weren't enough, Steve's acoustic talents are amazing. If you want an excellent cd to praise God by, then I strongly recommend you check out Wisdom-Discovery of the Word."
2,Way to short,"There is nothing wrong with this valance, it is just to short for my taste so I ended up returning it."
5,This is an absolutely amazing book,"But this book. The author does a tremendous job of exposing Lou Reed's life, his triumphs and his failings. You will not find a better Lou Reed biography anywhere"
3,Formulas and lyrics almost retarded,Kool Keith evokes a weirdness on the mic like Fred Rogers. Fresh beats and samples pick at your mind. Keith's lyrics are controlled by gamolite? The tracks' lyrics cross the line between cold illin' and straight actin' retarded. This album is a strange one for sure. Dr. Octagon is one of those albums you just can't seem to get rid of.
4,"Thick, weighted, quality glasses","I purchased a set for my new apartment after seeing an identical set used at my friend's place.My friend has had his set for 2 years and has only broken a couple glasses due to nesting the glasses.The shape is pleasing, and the weighted base is helpful in maintaining stability as well as adding some aesthetic appeal. The overall feel is sturdy as the glass is thick along with the extra thick glass base.Just remember, don't stack/nest the glasses in each other as they can easily crack and break!"
1,Break very easily!!!!,"I really like the look and feel of these glasses. The base is very stable and they have a more expensive look. However, the upper part of the glass is EXTREMELY thin and breaks very easily. I broke one glass when I tried to dry the inside with a dishtowel! The short glasses are much more durable. All but two of the tumblers are broken, thought most of the short glasses are still usable. Above all, don't put the tumblers in the dishwasher. It's very hard to get all the glass out when they break. I'm shopping for some different ones right now!"
1,Not dishwasher proof,We have owned and used these glasses for about a month. Already three have broken while in the dishwasher. We have never had this problem with any other glasses including our jelly glass collection. I believe the vibration/thermal stress causes the breakage- no evidence of banging against other dishes. Don't waste your money if you intend to put them in the dishwasher.
1,Thin. Cracked after 2nd wash.,"I loved the look of these glasses, and at first really enjoyed them. After two washes, the top of one of the drinking glasses cracked. I thought it was a fluke, or perhaps I banged it when I was putting them away. Since I've had them the rims have cracked on 3 of the glasses, and I've since had to discard them all.Waste of money."
1,The glasses are great--the packaging was not.,"My advice--do not order this item. It came in an oversized box with little padding between the Libbey box and the big box. The big box was very cheap and thin. No surprise then that one glass was completely shattered. The box came dented in in many places; there was not one mark labeling it as fragile or glass. Poorly done Amazon; a first for me from them. Now I am trying to find a way to get some kind of small credit for the one broken glass, and there is no such link."
3,Nice glasses but they break too easily,"Nice looking and inexpensive but they break very easily and when they do, they shatter into thousands of thin, sharp pieces. One even broke when putting it into the dishwasher. Although the taller ones feel much more fragile than the shorter ones, they have broken at the same rate - 3 of each have broken over a year's time, leaving me with 5 of each remaining. (Note: no kids - they've just broken when they tip over in the sink, or are placed in the dishwasher forcefully, or some similar trauma to the thin upper glass.Note that they are rounded toward the bottom, so the flat base area is smaller than it would be on perfectly cylindrical glasses. This is fine for hard surfaces, but makes them much more unstable when set on carpet or sofa or anywhere else you probably shouldn't be setting your glasses anyway.I like them, but I may buy some more durable glasses in a few months when a few more of these have shattered."
5,Incredible!,"This was a fantastic computer game! I'd been bored for quite a while, and this was exactly what I needed to pick me up. ""Black Dahlia"" was an amazing mystery thriller with fantastic graphics. The actors were actually quite good, a rarity in most computer games. I was so addicted to this game that I spent my whole day on it instead of an essay I should have been working on! Some of the puzzles are difficult (I'll confess to using the cheat sheet on most of it), but it was all so beautifully done that I really didn't mind. You must try this game, it's incredible!"
5,Great Film Noir atmosphere,"Black Dahlia is a lot of fun to play.You can really immerse yourself in the mysterious-40's atmosphere. I have always been partial to film noir, and BD captures the feeling nicely. The puzzles are medium to difficult, but not so frustrating that you tear your hair out before you solve them.And they are not pointless puzzles, either, which is appreciated. The entire ambience is dark, brooding, and at times, frightening.This kind of game is my favorite...good story,good puzzles,logical progression. The graphics are properly moody,as well.I think you will have a lot of fun playing BD."
3,Verbose,"This book could easily be reduced in size by 30%. It's verbose, and the details of many concepts (e.g., DMAIC, leadership structures) are repeated many times. Irritatingly, each time a concept is repeated, new or better explanations were used. Why can't the author define each concept accurately at the beginning? I'm sure anyone interested in learning the Six Sigma approach can absorb information well.I learned more about Six Sigma by reading several pages of John Oakland's book on Statistical Process Control. In order to get succinct info from Pyzdek's book, it feels as if I have to wade through thick mud to get the prized information.No doubt you'll get a lot of info from Pyzdek's book, but if, like me, you want ''to get down to business'' without wasting precious time, find a better book."
1,weak tool ever used,"Our company have bought a few grinders and we have a lot of problems with them. In two months e=we have exchange four machines, so what you think haw you could rated? For us -5 is the best rate. The number 1-star I did put just becouse you did refusd my inquires."
2,Cobra HH90,I was dissapointed with this product! The batteries does not last enough for a day at Sea.! and does not have enough power to reach distancesJose Quintero
4,A fabulous historical fiction novel!,"This is a great historical piece of literature. You feel like you're in the medieval time period as you read it. The descriptions are wonderful! This is the story of a young girl who helps a midwife deliver babies. She's called the midwife's apprentice, however, that's not the only thing she is called. Her names consist of girl, Beetle, and Brat. She sleeps with animals in barns and wears old rags. People torment her with names and threats, but she holds her head high and believes inherself. Eventually, she wants to deliver a baby all by herself, but the midwifee tells her she's stupid. However one day she can't find the midwife so she tries to deliver the baby herself but she just can't do it. She has failed and she runs away believing she can rid herself of her problems. This book teaches you not to run away from your problems. It's great historical fiction and is easy to follow. It's a great book to read over and over again."
2,Midwife,"Who lives outside in barns, begging for food? Well, in a book called The Midwife's Apprentice, Alyce, aslo known as Dung or Brat does. Since she is starving, she asks people for jobs she can do. Aluce finally convines a midwife, called Jane, to give her a job. Alyce also tells Jane if she works, she wants food in return. Jane agrees to the deal, and that's when Alyce journey begins.I didn't really like this book since it was boring. Even though the book was dull, I think Karen Cushman did a good job of expressing emotions of the characters, like when boys called Alyce names. I also feel a connection to the book. When Aluce didn't do an important assignment, she felt ashamed. I feel ashamed when I don't do something important properly. Karen Cushman has also written other books like Catherine Called Birdy.Really, I wouldn't reccomend this book to to anybody since it was boring. But I think people could learn from the moral of the story: which is hard work pays of."
3,"Okay book, a little boring","This book is okay, but I do have my complaints. The book lost my interest at a lot of parts, and it didn't have any action or humor in it. Those are two things that make a good story. This wasn't a good story. But it does tell a lot about how the medieval times really were, and I give it three stars for that."
4,This is a great book!,"The Midwife apprendice is about a young homeless girl that one day after sleeping in the dung heap is taken in by a midwife name Jane. Alyce helps the midwife deliver babies and also helped with the house chores. One day she is told to deliver a baby, but she tries an fails. She decide to run away, thinking that she is no help to anyone. She finds a job working in a Inn. One day a woman was in labor and Alyce deliver the baby, Alyce went back to the village to be the midwife apprendice.- This text refers to the paperback edition of this title."
4,Charming tale,"This short novel tells the story of an unloved, unwanted, and alone young girl. At first, Alyce, as she named herself, is found sleeping on a dung heap. This gave her heat she desperately needed. She is taken in by a sour, spiteful woman, the midwife. As time moves along Alyce learns to trust herself and grows into a capable young woman. This novel of self-discovery is suitable for younger middle schoolers. It is a charming tale well told."
1,The medieval Story,"I though this book was okay because,Alyce was so poor then she became a midwife apprentice The part I dislike was when Alyce was always picked on."
2,The Medival story,I thouht the book was not bad because when Alyce put the devil's footprints on the street.
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on!,"I thought this book was vulgar and very inappropriate to its intended age group. I would label this book ""cruelty as entertainment"". To name just one (of many) of the troubling scenes in this book is the childbirth scene in which the mid-wife wants to collect two fees from birthing mothers, but intends to leave one baby to die unborn.The language and subject matter is too mature for this age. Some themes in the book are cruelty to animals, disrespect for life, lack of good moral characters.I think, in a time when our youth are struggling to find a healthy self-image and healthy relationships with others, this is a book that should be avoided."
3,A Quick Read,"A quick read. I've been periodically reading the Newbery winners this year, and this was one I saw on the library shelves. I liked the old herbal references, and the personal journey of the young apprentice. Of course, I wanted a little bit more of everything: Character development, storyline, plot. But for juvenile fiction, it was well-done."
5,"Passionate, meaningful lyrics meet melodic interludes","Color Theory's second release is for anyone who enjoys great, passionate lyrics backed by intimately related, melodic music. ""Forget His Voice,"" my favorite track, tells the story of a couple trying to get through the woes of infidelity with poignant verses and an awesome chorus. ""The Perfect Song"" ironically discusses the difficulty of finding ideal lyrics to describe one's deepest emotions. Whereas these lyrics, and the rest on Tuesday Song, are drenched in emotion, it is really the music that keeps this CD in my car's changer at all times. Color Theory combines a rich synth sound with fanciful percussion and virtuostic piano playing. The music has something for everyone: simple moving dance rhythms, articulate and dynamic piano playing, and cohesion the makes it all come together. Any serious music collection must have Tuesday Song to be complete!"
5,It'll blow you away!,"The lyrics, music and voice behind 'Tuesday Song' will definitely blow you away. You can sense the deep passion within each song, especially the ones about love. This CD is a must-have!"
1,Trite,"Trite, self absorbed author looking at himself without having anything interesting to say. The book has nothing much going for it. Why does this writer think anyone is interested in hearing about his feet or his hair. The quality of the writing is mediocre. The mid life crises of a balding professor of a back woods college with no humor."
3,Better on the couch than for sleeping,"I use this wedge on the couch to stay comfortably on my side--it really helps prop up the belly so it doesn't pull. The small wedge even helps when I sit up providing more back support. I like that the pieces come apart and can be rearranged however feels best. I found it too bulky to use for sleeping. I also like to change sides a lot, and just using a few pillows works better than the wedge at night. It is great for a nap on top of the covers, but is too bulky to use underneath covers."
2,Construction dvd for 2 year old,"Our two year old grandson is nuts about construction....big trucks, bull dozers, etc. We ordered this dvd for him. This dvd is better suited for older boys, probably 4-6 years old. He will watch it for a couple of minutes, but there is too much talking and too little action for him."
3,ok but not what my son wanted,"I got this because it was cheaper than Mighty Machines and I though I'd expand my son's collection to boot. Unfortunately, it doesn't keep his attention the same as Mighty Machines and it misses the all important Mighty Machine theme song. As for me, I though that it was very educational but unfortunately, a waste of money it seems."
1,seriously stupid,I bought this because of the past rave reviews at how funny it was. Seriously people? The video is just plain dumb.
3,Better than nothing (semi-useful),"I was just looking for something different than what this offers. The print is miniscule so you either have to have superman vision or be under 21 to easily read it. (Unless you carry a magnifying glass around NY with you...along with your umbrella, metro card, one dollar bills, cap, water bottle, room key, ID, garmin, cell phone, etc.) It has thousands of listings; mostly of places I wasn't looking for. It IS small and manageable. Something to read on the subway."
1,As Bad As It Gets,"1) This is the thinnest plot I have ever seen. It's like they called Kevin J, said ""Hey, we want a comic related to the Jedi Academy, but we need the whole script in five minutes"" and this is what they got. Nothing is ever explained, nothing makes sense, the characters repeat themselves constantly, and the whole point seems to be to make Dorsk 82, who never really shows up again anywhere else as far as I know, feel good about himself. And I'm not even sure he does that!2) Luke looks like He-Man on a bad day, and I originally thought Leia was some totally new character. Does Dorsk 82 have to be drawn *shaking* in every frame? Why must everyone have spit lines between his teeth? The art in this comic is rock-bottom awful."
4,Jedi monster story,"Sometimes, you simply need a good monster story. The kind of terror, quick thinking and Jedi brilliance we glimpsed in Return of the Jedi when Luke dealt with the Rancor is revisited here."
2,Not Up to my expectations,"First off, I like to say Louie Devito is one of my best dj's around. But this cd was not like I expected. Underground volume 4 was faboulous. I couldnt stop listening to it till now. The songs from this track sounds like other remixes. You might as well download the remix from the internet and make your own mix. To me it sounds like remixes from radios. It was too ordinary"
4,"Whoa, this is pretty trippy, dude....","The first thing that pops in my head is what the ---- kind of name is that? Well, who cares? Its the content that counts. This album is not something you pop in the CD player in your car and cruise around on a Saturday night listening to. This is more like something you listen to when under the influence of several drugs. The music is so complex and beautiful that you need to be in some kind of meditation to listen to it. The first song ""Dreams"" perfectly fits this idea. But while most people will stop listening and put in something else, they really should be paying attention. This album can take you on a journey should you let it take you there. The journey ends with the best track on the 12-song set, ""Thoughts In My Mind."" The lyrics are really simple (Thoughts in my mind, just sail away/the images of you, just fade away). But the whole song just proves what the album is in one word: beautiful."
2,Rather Uninvolving,"""Dream"" remains a great (if lyrically obtuse) number, but nothing else here quite matches up. The few times the music seems to take hold, the lyrics seem to intrude - on ""You Create the Reason"", they seem downright clumsy. This might appeal to some, but I guess I'm not in that some."
3,"OK, but not what I expected","I listened to this CD in a music store and I barely ever listen to it. Dream & Thoughts In My Head are ok but the rest is....... The alarm clock part really bugs me. Also the ""medition"" Part. Whats up with that? If you are into this kind of music, maybe you could try & improve?"
3,Nothin new here,"As the mother of a teenager with ADD, this book was not the right read for me. This book deals mostly with younger children's issues and behaviors. It seems to be very similar to many other books I've read on the topic. But, may serve as a good base line of knowledge for parents who are just beginning to understand the disorder, characteristics and helpful strategies for dealing with it."
4,Works Fine,"I'm not floored with any change in performance, but there is a slight increase in the cars acceleration. Looking forward to never needing to buy another air filter again!"
1,:P,"This must have been a very VERY old book of hers. Really very short, inadequate description, sorry storyline. Confusing and sleep-inducing. Not a good buy, expecially seeing the actual length of the story."
1,A waste of paper,"Of all the McCaffrey novels I have read, this one is a total waste of time to read. This book is only worth anything to a compleatist fan who has to have every thing she's written.I have 1000+ SF/Fantasy books in my personal library and only a rare few are of such dubious quality that I have re-sold them to a used book store or amazon.com's Marketplace.....this book is one of those rare few.The plot is not well-developed, and quite contrived. It reads like something a grade school wannabee would turn into their teacher.....To me it seems that Kilgore Trout spent more time writing 'Venus On The Half Shell' (7 days BTW, and it's funny and good) than McCaffrey did on this piece of dreck."
2,Homophobic and convoluted,"I give this book two stars for it's guidance in leading a life of accountability. I give this author no stars for being a homophobic who believes homosexuals are pawns and spawns of Satan as he so brutally quotes in his book! To say that homosexuals are possessed by Satan is about as good as the author saying he is the ""source"" of a great walk of faith. Mr. Mcdonald, care to share any of your skeletons with the buying public?"
4,GREAT GAME BUT THE PS/DC VERSION IS BETTER!! NUFF SAID?,"Awesome game, My congrats to nintendo for finally putting out a good game and stop riding the success of Goldeneye! If you just have a Nintendo you should get this game, however if you have a Nintendo AND a Dreamcast, or Playstation you should get it for one of those systems and thats the only reason i gave it 4 stars! P.S. by the way my maximum score for the game is 329,000 on the warehouse. Feel free to email me your highest score at universal_maniac_182@yahoo.com Please PLEASE no junk mail or i will block your address permenantly!"
2,Taste Dusty...,"Upon peeling off the foil protective seal, I already knew this could not be an ""instant delicious pho broth"" miracle powder. I followed the instructions accordingly and the broth came out HORRIBLE. You could taste the ""complexity"" of the spices and a hint of fake beef, but the combination together gave the broth a ""dusty"" taste (for the lack of a better word) then leaves a slightly bitter after taste. I thought it was worse than the beef-flavored instant ramen broth.I tried again with some store-bought, low-sodium beef broth. Hopefully it would bring more ""beef"" taste to it. The broth came out overly salty and even more ""fake-beef."" Terrible.I tasted the powder by itself and it does taste a little ""dusty."" I think perhaps if you make REAL beef broth and use the powder instead of buying 5 different spices, it would be quite handy, but I'm not sure how to get rid of that ""dusty"" taste."
3,good cover when your're on a budget.,"I bought mine 3 years ago. I chose this one because I remember how hard it was to snap the others when it was cold. The J hooks are faster but don't believe it when they say it is easy in all weather. In the cold the vinyl does shrink and it is impossible with out a pair of vice grips. In the winter I never take it off. it is easier to crawl under the cover to retrive what your are looking for. In the summer it is great!!! easy to roll up and load oversized things in and out not like the hard shell covers. Beware when it rains, have all of the support bows in place because it will fill with water. The tarp is so strong that the weight of the water broke, yes broke the alluminum claps. I will be buying another one. If i could afford it i would get the one with the bows in the tarp."
5,SI 2005,"With the 04 Swimsuit Marisa Miller was the star & Again on this 05 edition she is blazing hot as always. I strongly recommend buying the 05 and 04 together, thats a great deal since I payed 20.00 for the 04 alone."
4,Hedy Lamarr shines through an ageold plot,"Were it not for the presence of Hedy Lamarr, this film would have been lost in the passing of time. Other players merely were there to support the latest ""sex symbol"""
4,umm......,"wow were to start on this nasty Lil flick, this film is surely not for everyone, Like seriously not for everyone. Anyways the film is filled with bizzare and nasty themes and has plenty of offensive material to some. If you are a fan of other controversial films Like salo, pink flamingos, kent park or caligula then this film is perfect to add to your collection ^.^ If on the other hand you hate those films, then stay as far away as you can possibly get from this movie. Oh and criterion is awesome, I Love how they put out these cult movies on DVD with bonus features."
5,"EROTICALLY SWEET...HOWEVER, BE PURE AND FRANK, PLEASE.","EROTICALLY SWEET...HOWEVER, IF YOU WANNA BE POLITICAL, BE FRANKLY POLITICAL, AND WITHOUT OVER-EROTICISM. MANY FILMMAKERS SIMPLY THINK THEY CAN BE FAMOUS WHEN THEY PUT POLITICS AND SEX TOGETHER, AND MAKE THEIR FILMS CONTROVERSIAL, THAT MEANS SUCCESS. HOWEVER, THE PRICE FOR THIS CAN BE SERIOUS, AND BESIDES, IT WON'T WORK SOMETIMES. SWEET MOVIE(1974) AND SUMMER PALACE(2007) ARE THESE ESSENTIAL EXAMPLES.IF YOU WANT SEX, DON'T BE TOO POLITICAL, AND THAT'S WHY I THINK SHROEDER'S MATRISSE(1976) IS A MASTERPIECE, IT'S PURE, SO IT GOES DEEPER IN BOTH EROTICISM AND HUMAN EMOTIONS.ALTHOUGH I RATE SWEET MOVIE LOWER THAN W.R., I STILL RATED BOTH OF CRITERION'S EDITIONS FIVE STARS, BECAUSE OF CRITERION'S SPECIAL VALUE FOR KEEPING DIFFERENT VOICES ALL OVER THE WORLD, AND ITS SUPERB QUALITY."
4,"Pleasant, Small Town Romance","After catching her husband screwing the temp, corporate lawyer, Jill Strathern, finds herself without a husband, a job, or a home. Desperate for revenge and a chance to regroup, she lands back in her hometown filling in at the local law office. She quickly finds that the small town has more to offer than she expects. This is my first by Susan Mallery and the beginning was a bit slow. But once you adjust to the pacing, there's plenty to like about the cast of characters. There's a great feel for the small town. Each character is well developed and interesting and by the end I felt rather attached to them. I would have preferred a bit more conflict, but for the genre, this is a well told story that's quite enjoyable. In fact, I'm looking forward to reading the sequel, Falling for Gracie, which covers Jill's best friend and her old crush, who had an even more interesting history together."
3,Easy reading contemporary romance,"Jill Strathern and her husband Lyle are working for the same prestigious law firm in San Francisco when Jill unexpectedly walks in on him - while he is banging his secretary in his office. She is heartbroken, frustrated, and angry, as she storms out of his office. Within hours Jill is fired, and she know that Lyle is responsible.Jll fills in at an old law practice in her hometown while she sends out resumes for a new law job in the big city. There she finds a secretary/receptionist with no interest in working with her and a new Sheriff that she had a childhood crush on in her early teens. She still finds him attractive, but he doesn't even remember her. Add mafia dons, a social worker who doesn't trust cups, and an aunt who reads Tarot cards and has a ""gift"" and the small town comes to life.This is a well-written, light contemporary romance; good company for a few hours of relaxation."
2,Not worth the agravation to me,"Jill Strathern is an attorney who catches her husband doing the nasty in his office. She is fired from the firm and heads home to lick her wounds and take over a small town practice.Mac Kendrick has taken over as sheriff in the small town of Los Lobos. He and Jill went to high school together, where he rejected her. She still is attracted to him, but he has a child and other baggage to deal with.Along with the usual love story there is also a mafia-type ""uncle"" dating Jill's aunt and driving Mac crazy as he attempts to take over the small town.I didn't really like this as much as I have her other works. I somehow missed this and that was probably a good thing."
1,Better books on the market than this one.,"This book looks good at first glance, but then it falls apart. The nice colored pictures cannot compensate for the poor hints and guidelines in creating the same effects. Also, many of the finished projects were downright ugly.I expected this book to offer something really fresh but it didn't. I feel majorly ripped off."
3,Different,"Well, unlike another reviewer, I don't have an anti-Tilson-Thomas bias, but this is not my favorite rendition. Its OK and different, but just a little too dramatic. It does not seem to me to be what the composer intended. Try instead ""Bernstein Century - Copland: Appalachian Spring, Rodeo, etc / Bernstein, New York PO""Or you could try ""Copland conducts Copland - Appalachian Spring, etc by Aaron Copland, Aaron Copland, Helmuth Kolbe, Columbia Symphony Orchestra, and London Symphony Orchestra."""
3,The grinch who stole christmas,"The book is a ugly photo album of the Grinch, as presented by the two copy cats who raised him until he ran off to live in his cave (this part having seen it, I think, came from the movie). Luckily for me, my time was up and time for me to go to bed,and was bored with the first ten pages; if nothing else, they no longer ask for Grinch things, making this book not really worthless. so my three stars for an otherwise one-star accomplishment. And the buzzing you hear in the background is the sound of Dr. Seuss turning in his grave."
1,No answer if you have problems with delivery,"This seller may be good, if they have what you order. If, however, they happen to be out of stock after you place your order, you will encounter massive difficulties in determining your order status. Not only are they extremely diffcult to contact, they do not respond to email. I wouldn't recommend this seller for items that are hard to find."
1,Horrible!,It's terrible. I stopped playing my game after 3 days. The levels get immpossible because you have to take on 3 people at once. The cars are neat and much better than before and the two player quest is fun. Period.
3,Nice but so fragile.,"I almost never give a review on things I buy. I know, it's very selfish of me; especially when I base my decisions on what to buy based off of them.I've owned these glasses for a bit over 3 months now or so. They're wonderful glasses, have great weight to them and look nice.Unfortunatly they also break really really easily. If you have kids, are clumsy, or even wash a little to vigorusly you might break them. Maybe it's simply a bad set, but I'm down to 9 glasses. Well, 10 if you don't count the one I used as an candle in a pinch and cracked from the thermal stress.TL;DR version:Nice glasses, real glass so they're fragile. If you think this might be a problem look elsewhere."
2,Need to be thicker glass,I have had them about 4 months now. They tend to break in half when I put them under the ice dispenser of my fridge. So you stand there looking at half a glass wondering where the hell the rest went. Sad yet kind of entertaining in a weird way as you never know when it will happen only that it will. 4 down so far.
2,not really as fun and the older versions,Not a great game. Does not make since in how you stroke the ball. Swing the club by moving the mouse back and forth is not for me.
4,WHAT'S UP WITH THOSE GRAPHICS?,"I already have a version this game from 2002 that I keep at my office. The 2002 version is a great game except for some bugs that cause it to freeze and block the result of the shot with graphics. When I got the 2006 version I found it to be fairly glitch free and equally fun to play. My only complaint is that the golfers graphic are far inferior to the 2002 version. The golfers don't look as realistic and when they walk they look like they have to go to the bathroom. What's up with that? I would expect with all the technical advances that take place in 4 years nowadays that this figure would be fair better, not far worse!"
4,Great Golfing Fun,Major complaint is that competition while you are working your way up through the ranks is not very good. I've only been playing a couple of weeks and am able to win amatuer tournaments by 22-23 strokes for an 18 hole match.
3,A bogey -- just so-so...,"I'm not sure what EA Sports was shooting for with this game, but it falls a litte short. Swing feel is inconsistent, particularly off the tees, on approach shots and putting.The backswing in 3-click mode sometimes speeds up much faster for similar shots/clubs/distances, making it difficult to gauge when to click. And some approach shots/putts I'll give it a fair amount of swing and the ball will go 3 feet. Then on the follow up shot, I'll give it a little more juice to compensate, and the ball flies off the green.And most annoying of all, sometimes when your turn comes to putt, one of the computer-generated players will be standing between you and the cup blocking your view and making it impossible to read the green.I bought PGA Tour 2006 to learn Pebble Beach prior to playing there later this year, and it's worth it to see the course. However, I can't recommend it for gamers who are looking for consistent play. It's just not ready for prime time."
4,Much more challenging than the '04 version,"Having played the '04 version of this game for a couple years, I was ready for new challenges. In some ways this version is more realistic in that rather than starting in tournaments which can be played over and over until a decent score is attained, this year we start as a real rookie and play one game a month with friends at one course in the hopes of getting the average down low enough to qualify for a tournament. The first year I didn't qualify and will have to start over with a new player. There is more time wasted as the charecters always display emotion (usualy temper) after a shot. The player builder is changed. I was able to get a charecter to look something like me in the old game but I can't quite do it in this one, As with real golf, I will keep trying until I get into the tournament and hopefully qualify to play in the PGA. I suspect that I will not do well enough on the first attempt and will have to try again ""next year."""
3,"Good for some, but not for all","This distribution of Linux is good to get you started. It installs easily and can set up most of your hardware automatically.Linux people who want customise, modify and otherwise manually enhance their system will not like this. The compiler shipped is a customised ""red hat version"" of the popular gcc, which means a lot of things will not compile and install correctly.The distro also installs a lot of software you might not want - even if you ask it not to!Add to this that you must now subscribe and pay for fixes to the operating system, I would not reccomend this to the serious user.Go for slackware instead."
1,Popular in Turkey,"Maybe this video is popular in Turkey, but let's be honest. This is not what I call tango. It's some Hollywood or ballroom charicature of it. Por favor, come to Argentina to see the real thing."
2,Book review,I didn't enjoy this book. I just had to read it for a class. It is a cheap story of a woman who can't find love because she sleeps around.
5,interesting preview,AN INTERESTING PREVIEW OF HIS LATER CLASSICS ON THE LIFE OF HITLER HUBRIS AND NEMESIS
2,Not so hot,"I got this because I read a review that the hungry hippos game was cheaply made these days, but this game was more durable. Well, after one use one of the working mechanisms keeps sticking. The marbles ARE heavier than the hippos game, but I wouldn't pay more than $6.00 for it, which is what I paid around Christmas. Its unfortunate that they don't make toys like the used to."
4,it's good if you just want to keep your self moving,it's good but don't expect to get a perfect bodyit's a bit slow so a gave it to my mom and she love itso I guess is just a matter of what are you looking for
3,OK,"Construction is less than first rate, and the sound level is too low to be heard on the main floor if there is water in the basement where the alarm is. In my tests, it does seem reliable in that it does detect water & alarm goes off. Best use would be on the same floor where you can hear it. Also this is more $$ than the Swann one also on Amazon, which is quite a bit louder."
3,"Good read, but not as good as ""Big mouth and Ugly Girl""","I got this book after reading ""Big mouth and Ugly Girl"", written by the same author, Joyce Carol Oates. I must say, ""Big mouth and Ugly Girl"" was better but i still liked this book a lot because i found it very well-written, although slightly slow-paced. I'm not much of a non-fiction reader, but I enjoyed this book and recommend it strongly to young teen or older pre-teen readers that like books that talk about difficult times that some young teenagers have to face."
4,As described though smaller than pictured,"I picked this up in order to convert a small EDC bag (a Maxpedition Jumbo Versipack) into a camera bag for my DSLR camera. The product is 8.2"" long by 5.7"" wide by 3.6"" deep, as described in the product info, but it's worth noting that the provided image is roughly 4x larger than the product itself. Even image for the compatible 1150 case looks significantly larger than the actual insert so be sure to base your purchase on the measurements and not the product image.Upon receipt I removed enough of the padding to secure a lens and I just insert my camera, lens down, into the bag and everything is secure. It's basically a perfect fit in the Versipack as well.If you're interested in a similar setup there's enough space to secure the camera body itself or up to two separate lenses standing vertically. I'm already planning on picking up a couple extra inserts to accommodate different carrying options."
4,"Sturdy and reliable, but not attractive","I bought this device for my visiting elderly father. It is very sturdy and works very well, but the appearance of our bathroom changed to the worse. It would be great if a good technical design also included esthetical side."
5,Really sturdy,"This has a been a great bathtub bar, elderly mother uses it, holds great, and have had to move it a few times, it is great."
5,So Good!,This product is AMAZING! My daughter and I split this package as a fun make it yourself lunch! I didn't even get to the chicken I had planned to put in this! I used cucumbers and a broccoli slaw mixture. They were messy but SO good. Highly recomend. The removal of the MSG is an awesome thing! Thanks Annie Chun's.
3,Identifies the foundations for great relationships,"This is a great book for anyone who wants to take his or her client relationships to the highest possible level. I am intimately familiar with a vast amount of literature on selling, but nothing I've read does as good a job at getting to the heart of what really creates lasting relationships. Clients for Life is interesting, entertaining, and successfully blends practical examples and cases with higher-level concepts. As head of global sales & marketing for a technology company, I manage large, sophisticated Fortune-500 accounts, and I found a great deal of original, immediately-usable insight in this book."
2,Only good if you have other dream books,"The book is lacking many of the common terms that one might look for in a dream book. I feel it is a great accompinimant to other dream books, but if you are wanting it as your first or only dream book you will be disappointed."
4,Aliens who are more than just Bug-Eyed-Monsters!,"I've been a fan of David Gerrold ever since he wrote ""The Trouble With Tribbles"" for Star Trek so many years ago. So when he stated this new series, I bought it right away. I still don't see how the humans can fight the Chtorr and talk about winning. However, if you want to try a RPG based on the books, I can think of no better game to use than GURPS. Includes some material not in the original novels. Hard to get nowadays, but worth the effort."
2,Love show!,I just found this show about a month ago and I ordered all 4 seasons and I have pre-ordered season 5. I hope this show lasts for years to come!
5,ABSOLUTELY EXCELLENT!!!!,"This is a wonderful recording! It might not be as good as 'Les Mis', but it's still awesome!"
1,Horrible...Major let-down,"This was the worst game I have ever played before. I gave it the benefit of the doubt, but after about 2 weeks I had to pack it up back in it's box, put it on my shelf, and go back to older games. Complete waste of time and money!"
1,Way too Buggy,"I was quite excited about Operation Flashpoint after playing the demo. It seemed the most realistic portrayl of warfare yet on the PC HOWEVER, after a failed installation I went to various websites attempting to find a soloution. I read through 30 pages of people expressing problems with the patches, installation, textures and various other features of the game. I am sure that for those of you who can install it, it will be nice however, check out the...to see what the people who have problems are saying. I would not recommend a purchase of this game until you can be certain the bugs are fixed."
5,Best Game of the Year !,"First of all my name is not Martha since thats my mom and also that I am a 15 year old male. This game I have had since the day it came out in the U.S. It is the best game I have ever played. It is so realistic with great graphics and the ability not only of ground soldiering but being able to fly AH-1 cobras, apaches, a10's, or even an abrahams tank. Since I have gotte this game I have played it for at least 2 hours everyday online. It is such a great game to play online I guess I should mention. It comes with software for an online gaming site thats free. In this game you can also make your own missions using the mission editor which is very easy to use and fun to use also since you can make some very neat type multiplayer or little missions for yourself to play. Leaving you with these opinions of mine , I highly recommend that you buy this game right now. Just add it to your cart and have fun."
4,"Pretty good, but not quite CS good!","This game is good, but not as good as Counter-Strike. The graphics are good, as is the sound. The difficulty is BAD, the enemy is very smart, hidding everywhere! That is what makes the game realistics though. Single player is fun, multiplayer sucks for now, few rooms and poor players await you in cyberspace. All in all, a good but not great game."
3,"Neat book, not exactly what I thought it'd be.","I am a die hard Charmed fan and my daughter has recently through re-runs caught the bug,so I ordered this book for her birthday assuming it would be like the ""Book of Shadows"" on the show. I expected pictures and descriptions of demons and things and the spells they'd cast on the show. It did have some of the spells, and a lot of information on the wiccan religion but, not a demon or ghost in sight. While I find wicca interesting if I wanted a book about it I'd have ordered one on the subject. In it's favor if your'e interested in the craft or in behind the scenes information on the show you'd like the book but, it's not the companion book the title suggests."
2,It's interesting,The book was more about wicca then the actually show. I bought it because I thought it was more show oriented. If wicca doesn't interest you I wouldn't buy it.
1,Not what it could be,"The author touches upon voodoo and shamanism but doesn't really delve deeply enough. Instead we get a collection of pop-new-age spells and charms rather than real meat. This is a shame as the subject area is interesting and the author could easily have gone further. A MUCH better read, for my money, is Vodou Shaman by Ross Heaven, which really does cover the ground in a quite revolutionary way and gives you information you can USE every day - and produce results."
1,not very satisfied,"I have an issue with the book that I just ordered. I paid $50 for a book that isincomplete. What I mean is on most of these pages, they do not finish thedescription of the demon or even the descriptions of the characters in thisbook. I am not satisfied at all with this product. I expected a little more thanwhat i received. If the seller is going to sell a book online, they need to makesure that every page is complete and not cut off. Please have someone call meabout this problem I have as soon as possible to ease my mind. It makes mewonder now if every book you sell is actually complete or not. I do not thinkthat this is right at all.Please call me at 850-791-9911Thank you Monica Smith"
2,Pretty dissapointed!!!,"Well, I thought overall this book was okay but it was definitly not what I expected it to be. I expected this book to have a lot of information on charmed, behind the scenes stuff, and to have all the spells that they said in each of the episodes. There was some behind the scene type stuff and like 5 spells. It was more for a beginner in witchcraft explaining what certain ingredients are for and where and when to do witchcraft which I didn't expect so much of. I also didn't expect it to be so old, it only features 2 seasons of the charmed show. Now there are 7 seasons, I thought it would have been more updated, it doesn't even have Paige in it! All in all I was pretty dissapointed in it and I wouldn't recommend this book to charmed lovers, maybe to beginners of witchcraft. But that's just what I think, hope you found this review helpful!"
4,charmed?,"if you adore charmed and really like witchcraft the book is manily on witchcraft and how you can perfect it i thought it would be more on the show and talk about holly marie combs, alyssa milano, and Shanned Doherty, and Rose Mcgrowan but it is mainly on witchcraft but i reccomend it !"
3,It's Cool!,I love the show so this is kinda like being behind the scenes and it gives me great bio's on the three girls and other important charactors on the show!!!
2,NOT WHAT I THOUGHT....,"When I ordered the Book of Shadows: The Unofficial Charmed Companion I really thought it would look exactly like the book on the show and have the exact wording inside of the original charmed book. Call me crazy. That's what I thought. I wasn't exactly thrilled with the book when I received it. I looked it over and although there are alot of interesting items in this book, I really did want the one just like they have on the show."
4,Good lights but NOT stand alone if that is what your thinking.,"They are VERY yellow but combined with High beams they work well. What I found it they work to enhance color and depth of other lights so they are worth it if you are in very dark roads as they allow you to ""judge"" distance better. Worth the money as a ""second""."
4,Brief map to the top.,"It has all the rules for chopping your way to the top, but lacks the detail to make it happen. In order to get to the other side of the river, someone can tell you to jump in and swim to the other side. However, it is nice, a la Nicolo Machavelli, to have someone give you detailed instructions as to how to do it. Like if you are half way across the rage filled river and find you cannot swim, what do you do. The book, none-the-less, is a nice desk top or pocket reference book to review your options during those times when you need a quick pick me up. A nice buy."
4,Dangerous Information For Anyone But Me To Know,"Cute. Good for laughs. When The Great Revolution comes, Mr. Guillaume will either become People's Minister of Truth or be among the first they'll stand against the wall."
1,Untrustworthy; Too good to be true,"Weighing well under the max weight, this chair failed after 5 weeks (1 week longer than the return window). The legs of the chair are flayed out under me, and I have felt them bend and start to give way. Very scary to feel like youre falling when already injured. I am ordering a new chair and not this brand."
2,Didn't work out for me,"Bought this just before my foot surgery. It only lasted 4 weeks. Seems like good construction but not if you are moving around on it. The legs gave out. Twisted to get my shampoo ended up on my butt, and I am way below the stated weight limit for this chair."
4,Good Purchase,"This arrived in time, however it was not gray as indicated above,when it arrived it was white. And I was disappointed"
1,to big,"it might be ok for some people,but not for me,it is way to wide for my shower,i should have did some measuring,but i have never had a shower big enough to use this"
1,BOOOOOOOOORING.......ZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"When George Michael came back 5 years later I thought he would come out with a Pop masterpiece. Instead he comes out with a boring, dreary CD that would make you fall asleep while sitting in the dentist chair getting a root canal. The only stand out song is ""Fast Love"" which still rips off that dance classic ""Forget Me Not"" by Patrice Rushen. George Michael needs to pump some blood into his music, even at a Old Folks Home, these people would be falling over dead before the CD hit the laser."
2,Not as good as I hoped,"Though Mr. Michael still has the pipes, somehow this album fails to click with me. It is not specifically bad, just not inspiringly good; and somehow I expect more from him than this, since the talent is there. I have had the album for a couple of months now, and I find I have listened to it only three times...definitely not worth the money I paid for it. Disappointing."
4,"Why not ""Listen Without Prejudice, Volume 2""?","""Older"" may be an album of his that gets lost in the mix, but if you're a fan of his in any way, it's well worth the listen. Despite taking six years to release, it's typical George Michael, and therefore wonderful. Included are the upbeat songs like ""FastLove"" and ""Star People"", as well as the slower and moving ones such as ""You Have Been Loved"" and ""Jesus To A Child"". I also enjoy ""The Strangest Thing"" and ""To Be Forgiven"". Even though George has been a star for 20 years now, I still feel he is slightly underrated as an artist. Each album of his leaves me impressed. If this album doesn't hook you right away, give it another try sometime, perhaps when you're ""Older""."
5,"A Classic, well described",This book by a scholar who opposes Scotus's philosophy is well researched. Gilson is a good reader and a good writer. Thank you for preserving it until I could buy it.
3,Pants Press,"Very expensive, no better than the $200 unit it replaced. Nice wood veneer, however not a dark rich color that you would expect on a piece of furniture for a bedroom."
3,"Same Stuff, Different Packaging","There are a great many innovative books out there on resume writing; this is not one of them. At this point, the only new approach to resume writing would be to make yourself a hologram of you speaking your resume--the formats in this book are just like everything else out there on the market. If you've looked at other books on resumes, you won't need this one. If you're new to the wonderful world of the working, you can purchase this and see what the latest standards are. Or you could search the web and save your money."
5,Come In And Burn- By Far Rollins' Best Work!,"This is by far the most powerful album I have ever heard. One of the few I have that I can just listen to straight through and relate to every track. All I Want has some of the best lyrics ever written and along with During A City and On My Way To The Cage are my favorite songs. Chris Haskett's Guitar chops are incredible, and Melvin's bass runs hold down the bottom end like a cinderblock. If you are a fan of Rollins, or metal with meaningful lyrics, BUY THIS ALBUM."
1,Waste of money,these clubs are a waste of money. The graphite shafts from cougar in a senior flex that is way uncontrollable unless u are 75. My 8 iron broke the first time i hit it. The bag is falling apart. Save ur money and buy a quality set of clubs. U can get some clone clubs that will last years and u'll play twice as better for just a tad more.
3,It's no Freaks and Geeks,"I only watched 4 or so of the aired episodes but from what I saw this show was nowhere near the quality of Freaks and Geeks or Undeclared even if it had some of the same people behind the scenes.It is better than most shows on TV, especially related to high school, but I would not even say it is better than the OC.There are these annoying scenes where time stops and the character talks to the audience and it just feels unnecesarry and forced.Sometimes it almost seems to focused on sex and not on character. Freaks and Geeks address sex but never lost focus of the characters.There are some genius moments but it is not a 5 star show. I might be inclined to give it 3.5 for the viagra incident alone. That was comedy."
5,Fascinating and deeply touching.,"This is a beautifully written book that explores the horrors of Stalin's reign of terror from the perspective of Anna Larina, Nikolai Bukharin's widow. It is a story of love and courage, but also provides important historical insights of great interest to anyone who is interested in the history of the Soviet Union. Highly recommended!"
5,More of Syd,"I liked this DVD even though I didnt learn anything more. Its just great footage of the band and other people who knew Syd. Im glad I got it. Cant wait for the next one. I think it will be out early December and Yes, I have already ordered it.If your a serious Syd fan get it when its available. I waited a year or two for this one."
5,Fantastic Product!!!!!!!,I have been taking this vitamin for about 5 years it makes a huge differance in my energy level. I would not be caught withoutit. debwinst
3,OK at best,"I prefer (& should have used more) Pre-test & USMLE world q's for clerkships.Case files are pretty good books, but not great. I'd suggest getting a text of some sort + practice q's, or just practice q's. Shame we end up so poorly versed in other areas of medicine after it's all said & done, but we don't have UK-length clerkships, so you have to cut down on how much you really learn. Oh well."
1,bla,If you like Tonight the Stars Revolt you'll probably hate this!Nothing alike nothing good nuff said.
2,would you be so kind as to pass me the vomit bucket?,"this was an awful cd. it relied too much on samples and not enough on the music. the vocals weren't nearly as good as tonight the stars revolt or transform. the lyrics make no sense and are just flat out annoying. no good no good no good! if it's 25 miles to hell, is that where they're keeping all the copies of this cd?"
1,Just not that interesting....,"I love zombie flicks, and most of them get a pass if they have a decent story line and enough action. This movie had a weak plot, weak acting, and was just a disappointment. I would not recommend it."
5,The Art of Inlay,A good place to buy things for specialistsArt of the Inlay - Design & Technique for Fine Woodworking - Second Edition (Softcover)
2,Smug self-satisfied and trite.,"When I first bought this CD I loved it and I listened to it over and over again. Now I can't stand the thing. Can't stand any tune in it. We're cool. We're artists. We got AIDS. So what? I'm sorry that the writer died because there is talent there, but after the hype and the fact that its not Andrew Lloyd Weber wears off, it's a fairly anethesized bit of fluff. It all sounds like Bryan Adams.Good to see as a musical, but don't buy the CD unless you want to hate the characters.Did anyone else notice that that ""one glorious song before I die"" that Mark sings to his dying love is the worst of the bunch?"
1,A stinker,"I love Broadway shows, but this one just ain't my cup o' tea. Overall very dull and overwrought. Extremely unmelodic. I saw the production a few years ago, and it was perhaps the most endless evening of my life. Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred HOURS long."
1,Rent? Is it the first of the month?,"May god protect us all from the day when ""Rent"" is at the top of the charts. It will be a sad day for musicals and music in general. There are some things necessary to a good show-good music, decent dialogue, people who have some idea what they're doing... ""Rent"" fails on all accounts. The music is sloppy, the dialogue is horrendous, and don't get me started on the performers. It is my theory that ""Rent"" derives its popularity from the fact that it differs in almost no way from the hideous popular music being written today. For the interest of not being stoned to death by the ""Rent"" lovers I am no doubt offending, I end my rant."
2,Nonsensical Mish Mash,I had high hopes with all the hype that this cd set would be extrodinary. Unfortunatly without having seen the play it seemed to me a mish mash or moronic singing of lines that incoherantly drift from one topic to the next never fully substantiating their meaning. If your a fan of the show maybe its phenominal but if your like me and havent seen the show dont spend your money on this
5,one of my favorite musicals,"I have always been curious of this musical, and i was overjoyed when i got a chance to see it live when it came to my hometown. I loved it!!! This is not one of those musical cd's that you buy just for the sake of buying a souveneer or supporting the arts. This is the kind of cd that you will want to listen to over and over and learn all of the words too, thank goodness the words are included!!! The music is fabulous, consisting mainly of rock with some gospel, latin, tango, (and x-mas music too!). The cast if wonderful, especially Daphne Rubin Vega, Adam Pascal and Anthony Rapp. Buy if you've seen the show, buy if you haven't. But beware: if you are offended by a couple of four-letter words, watch out. Enjoy!!!!"
5,This is the best thing that ever happened to me!,I love RENT! It has made me apprieciate life so much more. It has the best idea to it. I hope it lives for-ever on Broadway. If you get a chance to see it- DO IT!
1,It does my heart good...,..to know in about 10 more years we'll look back at this and find it just as laughable and as embarrassingly god-awful as we find Hair today.
5,unbeliveble,"I have encountered the ""Rent"" show on my trip to New-York ... as soon as i left the theatre i knew I have expirenced something else ... fantastic story , great music , and a perfect performence ... !!!!!!"
5,Phenomenal!,Explodes with talent and emotion - and everything on the cd is even better during the show.
5,Boiled down EKG,"This book is small but covers all the basics of reading EKGs. The entire book can be read in 30 minutes and covers everything in an easy to remember format. Highly recommend for any physican, especially those that do not read EKGs everyday."
5,"Great Item, Great Price, Fast Shipping","I bought this one after I was so pleased with one in a smaller size I had just ordered. Pelican is THE ONE for waterproof, dustproof, and safe equipment protection."
1,To small !,Quality is OK but the size is really small and expensive product. Next time will go for another brand instead.
4,Wow!,This is a great book!For a while there the buffy series of books were going down hill but this book turned everything right around!If your a buffy fan or you just like reading a good book this is the book for you!
5,i loved it,my english teacher gve me a stack of books and this one caught my eye. I just finished reading it and i cried i LOVE this book... I recommened this book to EVERYONE... this is by far the best book ever.
1,Puhleeez!,This was not what I expected at all. Has very limited ways it can snap together because of the way the connections are configured. Lightweight and will not stay put in the drawer when you take a knife out. Would not recommend it to a friend.
4,God's Work is Never Done,"4 1/2 Stars = Minor MasterpieceHere is a superbly creepy & disturbing film. A single father believes he's been chosen by God to destroy all the ""Demons"" on his list. He drafts his two sons to do God's bidding, as they stalk the ""Demons"" & kill them one by one. One child is skeptical & horrified by his father's actions, as the ""Demons"" look like humans. The other dives in head first in the killing spree, that adds a body count so high, that the FBI is on their trail.Intelligent script, great acting, & great direction by one Bill Paxton in his first directorial debut. A ride for the mind, & a trip for the soul. Are these ""Demons"" real, or is the father a complete religious psychopathic murderer?Watch & see!"
4,Difficult and Disturbing . . .,"That is exactly how my husband and I sat through only one-half of this film. It was too much to stomach on one full sitting. But the next night we watched the rest and I am glad we did. Obviously I will not reveal anything to you, however, as a parent, several of the scenes involving the children were uncomfortable. If you are able to watch partly gory but intensly psychological films, then this film is for you. Would I watch it again? Yes."
2,"""Mediocrity"" would be a far better suiting title for this...","...this movie shouldn't be even classified as a horror as it fails to frighten or terrorize on both visual and psychological aspects. A crime story with a supernatural twist, perhaps? The plot is slow and very predictable and I am not quite sure if it really did intend to provoke those few laughs from the audience. It shamelessly exploits the ""God told me to do it"" phenomena and to compare it to ""The Shining"" would mean an insult to a truly great film. It left me dissapointed in anticipation of something really scary and I would've felt cheated if I actually had to pay to see it. As for Mr King's endorsement I think his critical judgement has become a bit cloudy, perhaps due to that unfortunate and tragic accident."
4,One Heck of a Movie !!!!,"This movie was enthralling. It's starts with the sound of thunder - suggesting you should know better than to believe everything you see and hear.The biggest surprise is that this movie demonstrates that Bill Paxton is a talented actor & director. After his self-created talent purgatory of ""Twister"" and other gems, I assumed he was void of substance. Quite untrue. An excellent performance enhanced by a great script, EXCELLENT child actors and supporting cast.Whether you you like drama, suspense or horror, this movie is great fun. See if you can guess all the twists and turns!"
1,Fraility review,A terrible movie in every way.......no entertainment value. In a word: unwatchable.Would not recommend this movie to anyone. Awful.
2,Sucked me in and sucker punched me,"So...this movie, frailty. i liked the idea. Hell I even liked the movie or at least I liked it until the end. It's one of those movies that is just so great and then they throw a twist in and your left sitting there thinking What The F**k!!!I have to admit, I didn't see the twist coming. It surprised me. But it sucked because it ruins the whole movie. It turns it into this religious piece of crap that doesn't really make you think it just basically says that it's okay to kill a bunch of people as long as you say god told you to do it.I think I'm rambling... that is because I did like the idea behind this movie and the acting was great, there were even some really creepy scenes and a lot of tension, but the plot twist at the end ruins it all.... The cheesy flashbacks to the murders... the justification... I just didn't like it.I wouldn't recommend you buy this movie. I never will because the religious overtones turn my stomach."
2,high hopes,"A motherless family whose widowed father goes insane and gets his children to help him kill in the name of God. Needless to say, I had high hopes for this movie. The true horror in the film is the repeating of the word evil that makes me think of G. W. Bush. I have been told that this is what his childhood was like minus a few blows the head and the occasional line of coke. They must have cut that part out. The producer couldn't get the rights to the Bush story so they changed the names and released this. The similarities are undeniable. If you like disaster stories like Armageddon or the current administration you will enjoy this."
4,Good Movie,"Early Matthew M flim. Psychological thriller with an interesting twist at the end. If you like that type of movie, this is a good one to watch"
5,Thoughtful,Would I murder someone if God told me to? That's a tough question. But that's what this movie asks. Were the people they killed really demons or were they just crazy? If they were demons were their murders justified? I'll be thinking about this movie for a long time. Great movie.
5,Sevin Is the TRUTH,"Sevin speaks the TRUTH. This album talks about some deep issues in life that many people could relate to. I cant believe that Sevin is gettin Slept on so much!!!! I had a chance to meet this guy and he is hella koo. I actually had to go to his apartment to buy one of his cd (EVIN ANGELZ KRY), but it was all outta love. If you want to listen to real rap then listen to SEVIN!!! Im from Sac so I gotta support local rap. Keep spittin Sevin, and put Sacramento on the map!Best tracks on the album:Black womanmuzik 101Heathinz Tearzfather forgive metheropyby your sideI wonderaway we go"
2,A Very Basic Dual Language Dictionary,"I bought this last minute for a Korean friend visiting the US- unfortunately I hadn't realized that you can only look up the Korean words by their romanized spellings, and not in hangeul. I thought that at least the hangeul would be included, but it's not.This is best suited for a beginning Korean Language Learner who hasn't learned how to read hangeul yet. It's not very thorough. I can't remember which words specifically, but on more than one occasion, a word that seemed like it would be in the dictionary was not."
1,Disappointed,I'm a nurse and spend my work days on my feet. I had a pair of Asics shoes before and was very happy with them;however this pair was a huge disappointment. What a shame!!
3,its a key chain,"its heavy and long , so when your driving the key chain hits the dash or steering and is annoying, i shortened down the chain by taken it up to the 3rd eye on the chain it will fit right back on the ring. and that helped a little but for the price it was worth it."
4,More competent than compelling,"As the Editorial Reviewer noted in the quote above, Braun just doesn't hit it with this one. It's not bad, but not great. If you're interested in a ""brighter"" Braun, try Full Stride, his previous solo disk. It's a classic"
2,NOT non-stick.,"My mother bought these rings for crumpets. She bought them because I searched ""Non-stick crumpet rings"" and these popped up. She had to spray them with cooking spray because the food stuck to them. Do not sell something as non-stick when it is not true."
4,Works Great!,We bought these to be used for our breakffast program at school as well as for our welcome back breakfast we do in September. They work great and eggs do not stick! I would highly recommend these to anyone!
3,Not Bad,The product works as described. Rings are non-stick but work better with a little Pam sprayed on them. They are however a little smaller than expected. They are considerably smaller than a slice of bread.
2,egg rings,"In the picture, the rings looked like they would work great but after actually trying them out, no way. When all put together, they are very flimsy and awkward. I ended having to use them separately but then, then needed to be made of metal (like stainless) as their not very heavy. The actual ring idea works great but this item does not. I may try to find one that is put together solid and/or individual ones made of metal. All in all, I would not buy this item again unless I just wanted to fry one egg at a time."
2,not great,"These circle are held together by sliding each ring to a middle holder which does not stay together when trying to remove the rings from the pan if the egg/pancake sticks, what a pain. I would have liked it to be welded all together as one piece."
1,"good concept, poor quality","The rings DO NOT stay attached. The set is actually 6 pieces. The piece you connect the rings to doesn't hold them securely. The plastic handle doesn't fit either, and is completely useless. Picking this product up by the handle causes all the pieces to crash to floor, counter, ect... I'd love to return it, but the packaging got tossed out before I could."
2,Not heavy enough - doesn't work.,"The eggs run out because the rings aren't heavy enough to create a seal. Can't apply pressure because it's all metal and very hot. Essentially, useless. I use it to form hamburgers."
2,hokie handle,"The rings' handle is frustrating to use, not easy to move unit without rings coming off handle. Wish I would have bought the type where each ring has it own attached handle."
3,"You will need a 12"" diameter griddle (or skillet)....","if you decide to use all 4 rings at once. If using only 2 of the rings, a 10"" griddle or skillet should suffice.My impression is that this is a bit overpriced and there is nothing very special about the product despite the hype. If you take a paper towel and apply a thin coating of oil to the inside of each ring used, cleanup should not be a problem."
1,Very poor design,"I used to have an old pair of basic metal egg rings that worked great. But over time they started to rust and got to the point where I no longer wanted to use them. So I searched here for egg rings and found these. Well, these are absolutely horrible. The rings themselves are flimsy and the coating peels after just a couple of uses. The handle is a piece of plastic that barely has a hold onto the ""dock"" that the 4 rings hook onto. You can't get any leverage when trying to lift the rings, as they swing left and right quite freely. And forget about using just one or two. Good luck lifting them off the skillet to turn the eggs, especially if the egg sticks at all. I bought these in 2003, and they were in the trash before 2004.I just ordered these:Amco Round Egg Rings, Set of 2These look better than my original old ones that I loved.We'll see."
2,eh....,"too small and the eggs stick to them, became more of a pain using them. Now I just stamp a hole is a large piece of sourdough with a cup and crack the egg in there.. yum."
3,Different than McDonald's...,"As a person who used to work for Mickey D's, there are some differences with the tool they use to make Egg McMuffins. Theirs is heavy duty, felt like cast iron. Before cooking, we coated them quite liberally with melted butter, then cracked the eggs into the rings. Next step was to break the yolks with a spatula. Finally, the step that differs most from these rings - we added a heavy lid over them which had an integral little cup with a small hole in the bottom. We would fill the cup with water and the water would seep under the lid, hitting the grill and steaming the eggs to completion.I haven't used this item, but imagine if you are looking to duplicate the McDonald's process and want to avoid 'egg seepage' you may want to look for a heavier duty set and perhaps find a way to duplicate the lid idea."
3,Nice Little TV,"Got this TV to keep one step ahead of the upcoming transition to digital and to use in the bathroom. It wasn't too hard to set up but the problem of the channel numbers is kind of a pain. I keep a list by the TV so I know what I'm looking at! Also, the sound is a bit tinny but you get used to it. The color is good as well as the picture. I think it's a good deal for the money providing it lasts awhile."
4,Good book for Health Care professionals,"This is a good resource book for use by health care professionals. Sahrmann has good ideas towards movement impairments, but organization is a little hard to follow."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"This game flat out stinks. It's not a game, its a poor excuse to get your ($). First off, the game doesn't work with a joystick, so you have to use the keys... DUH!! The zooming is horrible, graphics are so lame its not even funny, and the overall game play is just plain bad.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Especially if you are looking for something fun to fly and then blow up some enemies. This game just flat out fails to do anything. If I could give this 0 stars, I would, but I can't, so its a 1 star."
1,This book is very poor,"This book is full of little more than hackneyed and vague slogans such as ""the mind is highly evolved"", ""the simplest theories are the best"", ""the mind is modular"", ""the program in your mind maintains a compact description of the world"", ""the mind is programmed by the DNA"", etc. It's one of the most annoying books I have come across in quite a while, especially given the incomprehensibly positive reviews printed on its cover and the self-promotion of its author."
2,It is not a lovely de-lovely soundtrack,"This soundtrack needed a boost from Tony Bennett, Harry Connick Jr., Norah Jones, Aaron Neville, and Dianne Reeves. The only two singers with great Cole Porter interpretations on the album are Diana Krall and Natalie Cole."
4,Cole,"Very well done album. I heard of this album at the movie theather, and was so surprised to hear an arangement of musicians. Alanis Morissette with ""Let's do it"" and Robbie Williams ""De-lovely."""
3,An Enjoyable CD,"For months I had been spotting this CD in the store and wanting to purchase it. Finally I did and while some of the songs or artist choices could have been different, overall I was pleased with my purchase. My favorite song so far is ""Anything Goes"", followed by ""Blow, Gabriel, Blow"" because it sounds Broadway to me and I like that.It always takes me a few listens to appreciate a CD and I know I will. It's nice to hear artists of today taking a step backwards and performing classic songs from an unforgettable era. Personally,Alanis and Robbie do the best. While some may harper on the techniques of the artists, I don't care for that stuff. If I like it, I like it, and for the CD, I'm liking most songs, so enjoy!"
5,A CD for lovers,"If you have seen the movie you will love this upbeat and romantic collection of tunes.A great Valentine Day gift or perfect for ""You're the One"" days!"
4,Jerry.......Jerry......Jerry...........WAY TO GO!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is Jerry Springer singing country songs/ballads. Musically a good album...Jerry does a decent job at singing and the musical arrangements are interesting. He does a better version of ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" than William Shatner on the ""Spaced Out"" cd. Though the latter is quite amusing. Other songs include: ""Let it be me"", ""Changing Partners"", and ""Cold, Cold Heart"". All are musically and vocally competent. The biggest laugh on the album is Jerry's written song...""Dr. Talk"". This song is played frequently on the Jerry Springer show during certain segments...though not always. I'd like to see Jerry do a follow up album.....maybe some heavy rock tunes.I recommend it....its worth it."
4,It's a great album,I heard the third movement of this piece at a concert sung by the King's Singers and I have been obsessed with it ever since. I'm so glad I finally found it somewhere and now I can listen to it as much as I want.The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the digital download of the first movement starts with 5 seconds of incredibly loud feedback and electronic noise. I had to edit the mp3 file myself to take it away.
4,Not for beginners,"Lawrence Diggs is, in all likelyhood, the most knowledgable vinegar enthusiast in this country; but that doesn't make this a great book. It's a problem of editing and clarity, it just isn't written for laymen and the writing is often off-kilter. Additionally, it's directed at an audience who already knows how to make vinegar but wants to fine-tune production.I found it to be immensely helpful in tweaking my vinegars, adjusting acidity and preventing infections... but if I only had this book I wouldn't have known where to start in the first place.The bottom line is if you want to learn to make vinegar you are better off with The Joy of Cooking or How to Cook Everything; when you're ready to take your Vinegar making to the next level this is the book to read."
5,Classic George Michael,"this was the Jam back in 96 a cool Sample use of Patrice Rushen's ""Forget Me Nots"".His Voice&the words&Music are all on time on this cut.the extended Version is cool."
1,"Sex, Sex, and More Sex","My review title says it all. An implausible plot, no mystery, you know from page one how it will turn out. I guess I am giving it one star because you can fall asleep during half of the book and still not miss anything. I listened to this book as an audio book. Might be a good 'beach book.'"
1,Absolute drivel.,"I am unfortunately listening to this book so I cannot easily fast forward past the many descriptions of Allison's nipples. I don't mind sex scenes in books but these are nauseating. Just finished ""The Alibi"";glad I read that first because Thursday's Child would discourage me from ever reading Sandra Brown again."
2,Crashes for me too,"I just bought it - it crashes. It happens when I am trying to build the more advanced transportation (trains, trams, etc). I wish there was a fix - it was a good game up until the constant crashes. What a dissapointment."
