1,Doesn't heat,This should have been a better hot lather machine then the last Conair I had but this one sucks. It does not get hot enough to even warm the gel. Would not recommend this one at all.
2,Boring - Why bother?,"Nice cover, but what about the food? I've dabbled in vegan-ism, but this book turned me off. Try purchasing a cookbook with some flavor!"
3,A good start,"I bought this book to help me make the transition from vegetarian to vegan. Some of the recipes are quite good and some are not all that great. The biggest problem I have with it is that many of the recipes are more work than I want to put into a meal- I was hoping for more quick, easy, and simple recipes. Still, it's worth it for the recipes I do use and has helped me learn more about cooking. Plus, the extra information in the back is helpful!"
3,Good for new vegans,"For the price, this book is pretty good for new vegans. It contains a lot of interesting and useful information and some very good recipes. However, I've not had the best luck with all the recipes I tried. For example, the, ""Light Apple Bran Muffins,"" recipe stated, ""Makes six muffins."" I'm pretty sure I followed the recipe correctly, yet I had enough batter for 12 big muffins; and I had to adjust the baking time. I've also had to make adjustments on other recipes I tried. Even so; the recipes are easy to follow, and for the most part, they are pretty good. The index can be dificult to use. Overall, this book is helpful if you're just starting to embrace a vegan lifestyle. You might want to check it out of your local library and try it out before buying it."
5,Awesome book for new veggies,I love how most of the recipes contain ingredients that are readily available. I've tried about 15 or so of the recipes and they have been wonderful! Great resource for new vegetarians!
5,This book is awesome!,"Before I was vegan I loved this book! The recipes are excellent, and they are fun! This is a great book for people who just enjoy eating, even if you are not vegan!"
5,"Includes entrees, soups, sauces, breads, salads, & desserts","Self-described ""lazy vegetarians"" Sarah Barnard and Sarah Kramer are two long-time friends who decided to ""go vegan"" as a result of their love of animals. Together they have collaborated to bring aspiring vegetarians How It All Vegan!: Irresistible Recipes For An Animal-Free Diet in order to help them make the transition from a meat-based to a meatless diet. The recipes include entrees, soups, sauces, breads, salads, and desserts which can provide the makings of terrific menus for any and all occasions. From Sparkling Homemade Ginger Ale; Garlic Dill Cream Cheese; and Stuffed Spaghetti Squash; to Maple Buttersque Icing; Zesty Cheese Spread; and Spiced Chai Tea, How It All Began is completely ""kitchen cook friendly"" and is additionally enhanced with vegan friendly recipes for cosmetics, hair products, pet treats, and even household cleaners."
3,It does an ok job..,"Long ago this product was like magic...I don't know if they changed the formula but it works differently, but still sufficient enough to do the job...The only real concern I had was the way it was delivered. I expected it in better more snug packaging,as well as,to stop leakage from the bottles,they should have been placed in plastic bags as well. The caps get jarred loose during packaging and or delivery. I opened the box 2 days later after I received them,they were both leaking and when i first received the package,the bottles were very loosely packed in the box."
1,"Fun & Games is lame, lame, lame!","I am planning a family reunion and need some fun, creative ideas, so scanned the good ol' Amazon database for something helpful. I discovered this book, and ordered it. What I found between its covers were a bunch of ridiculously lame games, and largely unrealistic suggestions and silly ideas for what would amount, in my mind, to the family reunion from hell, should anyone actually put these goofy ideas into practice. (I certainly will not!) Some may find these games and suggestions fun and creative, but I just hope that I don't have ocassion to attend a family reunion that's been planned by them. I did not find one single idea that I'm willing to use in this book. On the other hand, I've since found magazine articles with some very good ideas for family gatherings, which I definitely will use. This book stinks!"
2,Another My Little Pony Story Re-released Separately,"I don't understand this at all. Why are they releasing the My Little Pony story Pony Puppy again, but this time not with all the others. I even think that My Little Pony Two Great Pony Tales was also unnecessary because it had The Glass Princess and The Magic Coins, and they are already on the Complete First Season DVD set. I want to tell all of you My Little Pony fans to say no to a second release from My Little Pony unless it is released uncut unlike last time."
1,Worst Video Ever,"I bought this for my daughter's 5th birthday. She loves puppies and My Little Pony, so what could be better? The first episode had her in tears, and the second episode was so scary that my eight year old daughter couldn't sleep. And the picture quality was terrible. This video is going right into the garbage can!"
4,Good encyclopedia of natural remedies,"This book is a good reference for ""what to do for ..."" situations, such as ""I have a migraine; what do I do?"" The author is very diligent about providing solutions from different schools of thought, including naturopathy, homeopathy, reflexology, aromatherapy, etc. Also included are ways to alter one's diet to promote healing. My only criticism of the book is the relatively small amount of information regarding disease prevention."
1,The Oracle of Baloney,"The best I can say about this heap of trash is that it resembles a cookbook. If it were a cookbook, I could accept on faith that baking powder should cause my cake to be fluffy. But this is not a cookbook. It is supposed to be a description of natural compounds and processes to be administered to heal the body from various illnesses. Thus in my mind some element of proof is required to show why these cures are supposed to work. None such is offered.I don't believe Rector-Page really understands the subject to the depth I require. So I'm certainly not going to take her word. Her ""PhD"" is from a ""University"" outside the normal accredation circles. Maybe some of the things in this book could be helpful, but many of the more main-line, healthy living or medicine reference books have some natural healing information in them that are from more trustworthy sources.Get a second opinion before you try anything in this book. Better yet, chuck it and start over."
2,Kindle version has to many errors,"I finally gave up reading this book because there were to many errors in the kindle version. Allot of times a paragraph would not make any sense and I slowly discovered that sentences were being taken from the beginning of the paragraph and added to the end, and sometimes the sentences were chopped in the middle and split between the beginning and end of the paragraph. I am a slow reader so having to reread paragraphs on a regular basis to try and make sense of them was to annoying."
5,Perfect Pack,"This pack is great, i use it for snowboarding, white water rafting and some hiking. extra storage pockets come in handy. very durable."
5,Another fine aviation resource book from William Green.,"A detailed overview of the development of fighter aircraft achieved through detailed pictorial, diagramatic and written analysis of 100 examples. True to form, the authors knowledge of technically important and interesting but little known and often ignored types, as well as the better known classics, is what makes this book really stand out and draws the reader back again and again."
4,Amazon review,William Powell & Myrna Loy - 1 of the best duos in cinema history. Nothing more needs to be said.
5,A great film!,"I just love William Powell and Myrna Loy films. I really ejoyed this one. I highly recommend it, and would give it ten stars if I could. It's funny, witty, and charming!"
2,"Good in theory, not good in practice.",These grips were on my daughter's school supply list provided by her teacher. The idea is to promote proper pencil holding technique while writing. Unfortunately the pencil would keep getting pushed back out whenever she was writing. She would be forced to stop and pull the pencil back out several times. So now we are stuck with a bag full of grips we cannot use.
2,Try another brand,"I was getting some squeaking from the original sway bar bushings after 7 years and 120,000 miles so I bought these replacements. Big mistake. After less than a year these things are driving me crazy. Any little bump and all you hear is squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak!!! I'm going to try a different brand.Dennis"
4,"Brisk and believable fiction, albeit about a vampire","Joan Perucho, the unique author from the Catalan area of Spain writes in a moving yet dynamic manner. After reading this novel you can almost believe that a vampire could exist as well as probably feeling comfortable with one. It is very sad that none of his other prose or poetry have been published by Knopf (the publisher of ""Natural History"") or any other publisher. This articulate, insiteful author deserves to be published in English many more times."
2,waste of money,I purchased this tool to help me in a Spanish class. The display is hard to read and there are no special characters. Overall it was a poorly designed piece of electonics.
1,Pure 100% Garbage,I can't beleive how cheaply this item is constructed. Mine also went back on the same day. DON'T BUY THIS!
1,Disappointing product,"This product is a toy masquerading as an instrument. The compass is inaccurate, seldom getting within 20 degrees of true direction, and is often off by 30 to 35 degrees. The clock does not keep good time either, and is difficult to set. Each time an adjustment is needed, one must get out the instructions that came with it (if you still have them, if not you are the proud owner of a new paper weight)."
2,A Door Near Here,"This book is about these four kids who are trying to take care of themselves while their jobless alchoholic mother is in bed, their father was remarried, the youngest sister wants to find the door to Narnia, and the strange reactions of their teacher Mr.Dodgson.This book was one of those coming of age books.Its like ""The Dangerous lives of Alter Boys"" meets ""Stephen King's The Body""AKA ""Stand By Me"".I Liked the fact that the kids smoked and sweared.It made it more realistic.THe ending was kinda good."
3,"nicely written, but not very accurate","This book is a very good book if you are just in wanting of some light stuff. I was browsing the library and found it, thinking it might be interesting. this is what i got: ""blah... no food.. blah ..im scared of my mom"". First off, since the main character is so bossy, why can 't she be smart enough to make her mom get up off the bed. Why doesn't she just throw all the bottles of alchohol out. I almost wanted to strangle her when she gave her mom the last bit of money they had while she knew thta all the bottles were finally empty. If you want to read a shallow book about th troubles "" without parents, no fun"" I think it says in the review up there, read it. If you want something more real or with more life.. then go read another book. This book was shallow, stereotypical, and though the story is not farfetched, the characters are."
4,"Compelling, tragic but honest!","A Door near here surronds Katherine, a girl who is forced to grow up and take care of her family which divorce has seperated her and alcoholism has left pretty much starving. Only Katherine is determined to keep them together, at all costs. She resorts to convincing everyone everything is ok, sometimes even herself and including her father who visits with his new wife. She knows he would offer to take them in a second, but Alisa, the youngest is a child of one her mothers boyfriends and splitting up is not an option. The rest of the story follows Katherine's desperate situation, dealing with nosy teachers and Alisa's new obsession with finding Aslan. The lion from the Narnia books according to Alisa is the cure to her mother's 'sickness'. All three oldest deal with keeping her in reality, without loosing their touch with it in the process. Written well and extremely compelling. It's a sad book, but a good read."
1,Not thrilled with this,"My 8 yr ol daughter received this as a gift. We were greatful for the gift but when left to set this up and drink the smoothies, we both were a little skeptical about drinking them.The consistency left a lot to be desired and you had to use your imagination for the taste. The brownies(cake?) weren't to bad I was thrown off that we didn't have to bake it at all though, you mix the stuff together and eat it. Overall it was a nice exerience for my daughter to try things on her own and see the end result without having to deal with the oven. However clean up after using this product was almost as bad as when we bake from scratch so...be prepared!!"
2,All I can say is 'Eww'.,"If you even do get this toy, trust me and do not eat the food. I tried it and nearly gagged. I couldn't get the taste out of my mouth for a long time! It is absolutely disgusting. The only reason I gave it two stars is because the toys are kind of fun to play with. I reccomend getting an Easy Bake Oven...NOT this! If you DO get it, do NOT eat the food. I wouldn't even let my little brother eat it after I tried it, it seemed toxic. So trust these reviews, the food is GROSS!"
2,"MitzvahChic: How to Host a Meaningful, Fun, Drop-Dead Gorgeous Bar or Bat Mitzvah","This Book was much less than I'd hoped for. It really didn't give many ideas for someone already in the beginning of the planning stages, and the theme ideas were pretty limited and not very creative."
2,Toys,This wasnt for me it was a gift to a friends son. He really liked it. So thats all that matters.
3,Not my cup of tea,"Author concentrates too much on minute details which are in many ways irrelevant/implicit to many readers I feel. At times after reading a whole lot of pages, I feel like I have learnt very few newer things...same things are repeated often. Too much focus on the relationaljargon, rather the author says to strictly follow the terminology. Like the way, natural languages have many dialects, in the same fashion many readers will learn in different ways though conceptually they are on the same track. As far as I am concerned, it does not really matter what jargon is used as far as the knowledge can be put in practice correctly."
3,Better books out there,"Although this book is fine for someone who hasn't experimented a lot with different sexual positions, I've found others that are more helpful, interesting, and well written. The positions are just that, with too much other stuff thrown in and not enough about the actual position. My suggestions instead would be Sex and the Perfect Lover: Tao, Tantra, and the Kama Sutra. Everything this book has, but much more, and better explanations of the positions."
1,not satisfied again,Was so dissapointed when received this barbie doll because the box was damaged and it is for displaying. I did keep it though. Would have liked to have known the condition of the box before sent.
4,Great new Talent!,"I first saw these boys (all one family) rather young when they opened at a Reba McIntyre concert. Great young talent, watch for them as they are quite the up and coming group!!!!"
5,Great Hawaiian Music,I spent 10 years living in Hawaii -- this album is SO mellow and has a little of everything. I am very hopeful than Mihana will be recording more CDs in the future.
4,Thumbs up!,Purchased this as a stocking stuffer for my grandmother and she loves it. I want to purchase one for myself next. Will purchase from this seller again!
2,Silver thumb ring,This ring is nice but runs very small. I ordered a size 7 which I have another thumb ring in that size. This one didn' fit while the one I already have fits perfectly. What's up with that?
4,Davey and the crew mature like everyone else.,"Compared to A.F.I.'s indie releases, Sing the Sorrow is not just more of the same. But then again, besides for those who will cry over change, is that such a bad thing? All the great bands have always grown as musicians and learned to expand the possibilities contained within their art. AFI's newest effort is no different than any other band that has taken their musical talents beyond what they started with.Is this really such a crime?OK, granted it does not sound like it was recorded in the bathroom at a local church, but the melodies and harmonies in the songs hint at musical growth within the group. Will songs like ""Bleed Black"" and ""Dancing Through Sunday"" cause older AFI fanatics to say ""this isn't afi, it is [junk]!"" ? Undoubtedly. But then again, every band has had to shed its fanatical following to do their own thing.Just because it is good does not mean AFI has sold out. I highly recomend this."
1,terrible,"i wish i could give this 0 stars, because this record is such a major label sell out. why would afi sell out? not enough money? try their older stuff, its much better. the only people who seem to like this stuff is teenage girls and emo kids."
2,Hype,"This album had a lot of hype behind it, at one point i read an article somparing it to Nevermind. There are a lot of good songs on here but Girls not Grey is a terrible pop song thats couldve been penned by Blink 182. The rest of the album is a mixed bag of gothic goop or some decent rock songs. Let's just say this is not an uplifting record. The art work reminds me of Smashing Pumpkins' Adore album."
1,AFI CORPORATE ...,In AFI's new album everything is slower and more repetitive. The song that is played constantly Girl on Grey has repetitive three or four word lyrics which is similiar to most corporate [stuff] that comes out. If you like waterdown punk music that is sugary sweet this is your album.
5,This is a great CD,"If you like AFI, you'll love this CD. There is not one bad song on this CD. And the two added songs are awesome. I highly recommend this CD, whether you buy the regular version or the England version."
2,title of review,"Ok, firstly, if you think this band has any artistic depth in their music you are kidding yourself. Whatever darkness they supposedly exude is entirely visual, and possibly lyrical (I wouldn't really know, can't understand a word he's saying). It in no way comes through in their music. This is throwaway pop, and bad throwaway pop at that. I had a pretty dim view of this band before hearing this album, but I actually turned myself around to the mindset of thinking this album might be something I could get into based on what I read about it, but wow, so disappointing. This band isn't even of the calibre of Fat Wreck Chords label throwaway pop punk bands, it's beneath even that. This is just bad music. Comparable to Britney Spears in its extreme level of style over substance."
5,Another step in the bands continuing evolution,"I think that this is a great cd from Davey and the guys. It is different in the way that Black Sails was the start of something different, but obviously good in my opinion. I have been an A.F.I. fand for about 6 years now and I love all their stuff. I think the are the best band period. I'm sure some people won't like it but I thinks it's awesome and you should give it a listen."
5,THIS CD ROCKS!,This cd is one of there best. The song lyrics are deep and the rifts are genious. BUY IT you'll love it. There sound has evolved so much and its in a good way! if you've never heard of AFI befor this is the time to check them out. Between Death of Seasons and the leaving song this album has many leavels and sounds. It is a wonderful cd and AFI keeps getting better so go buy the cd!!!
5,AFI continues to amaze,"AFI's new album sing the Sorrow is absolutely amazing. With every album they continue to re-invent their sound and each time it gets better and better. The lead singer, Davey Havok, has a voice that full of emotion.The lyrics are extremely poetic and meaniningful, they are definately not like your typical love song. AFI's new album Sing the Sorrow breaks through the stereoypical boundary that is popular ""Punk Rock"" on the radio, it is a genre all its own."
2,No.,"Don't listen to any review claiming these guys didn't sell out, because they did. If you define ""selling out"" as signing to a major label and going from a hardcore punk sound to a completely boring, overdone, trendy ""dark"" pop sound, then yes, they did sell out. Anyone that likes this album is only convincing themselves that they do so they can go out and wear a studded belt and black t-shirt. If you want hard punk with great yelling, chanting, and driving guitars and drums (real AFI) listen to The Art of Drowning. If you want a lame excuse to wear eyeliner and convince your high school friends that you have an ""edgy"" musical taste, then by all means listen to Sing the Sorrow. Just don't lie about it on amazon and tell anyone that its actually good."
1,sux,"AFI sux, the lead singer sounds like a chick thats 9.....they attempted to be dark and misterious,but sound like wining little 10 year olds that sing about killing themselfs.....and my dog can rite better lyrics"
5,One of the Best Albums of the Year,"""Sing the Sorrow"" has to be one of my favorite albums that was released this year. ""Miseria Cantare (The Beginning)"" was a nice sound off on the album followed by ""The Leaving Song Pt.2"". At first, I hated this song but then it grew on me 3 hours later. ""Bleed Black"" was another one of my favorite tracks as well as ""Silver and Cold"", ""Death of Seasons"",""The Great Disappointment"", ""Paper Airplanes (Makeshift Wings)"", and ""Girls Not Grey"". ""Dancing Through Sundays"", ""Death of Seasons"", ""The Celluloid Dream"", and ""...But Home Is Nowhere"" are amazing. The weakest track on the CD is ""The Leaving Song"", but the tune constantly gets stuck in my head, and I find myself playing the song over and over. Basically, if you are sick of the ""punk"" music that's dominating the airwaves, this album is definitely for you. Otherwise, if you're just getting it to be cool, you'd be better off downloading it on your MP3's."
2,ehh...,"Now, eye myself am a personal fan of more thrashy punk, like AFI's older cd - Shut Your Mouth And Open Your Eyes, therefore this album, to me, was absolutely horrid. The only reason that it, to me, deserved even 2 stars was because of Davey Havok's amazingly poetic lyrics, though their style has definately changed for the worst, in my opinion. This cd would be great for more of an emo fan because of Davey Havok's AMAZING voice, but if you are more of a fan of hardcore punk, eye would recommend Shut Your Mouth And Open Your Eyes, or The Art Of Drowning."
2,This album makes me sad....,"I like this album, it is ten times better than almost anything that came out last year. The problem is, it's just not AFI. AFI used to be a hardcore punk band straight from the east bay, now....well now they're just another mainstream goth/rock band. What the deuce happened?! Black Sails,Very Proud of Ya, Shut Your Mouth, and the two Ep's were freaking classics. STS falls well short of this mark, I can only attribute this fact to their signing with Dreamworks (soon to be corrupting another former great, Rise Against). Please folks, if you like this album (and it is a pretty good album) get yourself some older AFI, it's all better. That's precisely why I gave this two stars, they can,and have done MUCH better."
1,A shameful CD in a stack of classics!,"AFI was without a doubt one of the greatest bands of the 90's. They even continued their saga into the year 2000 win they released one of their best records, The Art Of Drowning. But when Sing The Sorrow was released it completely changed the bands image. Apparently they'd rather have preteen girls listening to their music now rather than people who actually know good punk rock. The switch from hardcore to alternative really un-inspired my friends and I. I believe this CD is horrible. DONT BUY IT! You know in AFI's first music video Davey Havok said, ""As far back as I can remember I always wanted to be in a hardcore band."""
4,my first afi album,the only album by them i own its good in its own way i hate emo but i would never describe afi as being so i enjoy this album it has so many good moments is not a classic but its extremely hooky i love the guitar in this its really good and the vocals are brilliant one thing though i have none of afis other work to compare it to so i dont now the sound of the band off by heart but this is a good buy
1,Where is AFI,"After hearing some of the said album claimed to be made by AFI. I have come to beleive that the real AFI was kidnapped and replaced by another band. So where is the real AFI people?Oh, the album blew and reminded me of the crap major ""punk"" bands like Good Charolote would make. Do yourself and save your cash."
2,Hints of triumph,"2 1/2Starting with promise, this emo-neo-punk carefully calibrates melodic anthems and thrashing bashers into an accommodating whole, but looses personal steam as the album trudges along and more generic qualities begin to override earnest energy."
3,A disappointing effort,"I'm finally getting around to reviewing this album after having bought it the day it came out. AFI up until this point was showing alot of promise as being one of those bands that was going to stick to their guns and actually bring some integrity back to mainstream music. However, they hooked up with Jerry Finn and Butch Vig, 2 producers who have a notorious reputation for ruining bands or just producing outright crap. The result sounds like a band that listened to Linkin Park and decided to drop the rap element and mixed a little Duran Duran in just to make it an even bigger pile of garbage. The majority of this album is commercial junk obviously designed for radio airplay. The lyrics are subpar, which surprises me coming from Davey Havok who delivered such a lyrical tour-de-force on The Art of Drowning. In closing, I would say if you are another Emo Sheep, buy this album."
5,The best CD yet.,"When I first heard about AFI's new cd coming out, I instanly ran to the store and bought it. Not sure as to what may lay ahead the moment I bought it, and put it into my cd player. Listening song to song, a constant amazment flooded over me. Not only was the music beautiful, but the lyrics were also wonderful. Compared to past cd's like The Art of Drowning, and older cds like Very Proud of Ya you see a constant change and maturity of there music and style. I would definetly recommend this cd to anyone who has a taste in awesome vocals and harmonies, great musical talent and likes to hear about things in life put in a different, almost hidden prospective. Two thumbs up."
3,not bad and not that great,One kid I knew at work got me into this band and I love all of their album. This is cd is pretty cool but this is not Afi's real stuff. This cd is alot slower paced than all their old stuff which is the only thing i dont like about the cd but other than that i some songs on it. So far i dont regret buying this album. the song that really stands out is death of seasons. when they make a new album they better not make another girls not grey or any other slow song or else we be screwed with the 12 year old teenyboppers and that would suck. (...)
4,Sing The Sorroe.,"To me Sing The Sorrow is more of a ""A Fire Inside"" style rather then a ""AFI"". One of the better I think. They have slowly lost their ""punk"" edge and have mellowed out to what I think is the better of their music. The lyrics are poetic and the music is meaningful. You can tell from this album they put their heart and soul into what they do."
3,one statement on AFI.,"i just have one thing to say. AFI is not punk rock. they never were, and they never will be. punk is about fighting for your beliefs, not wanting to commit suicide."
5,Great read,Great read. I love the interaction between Boots and the bugs. The innocent acceptance of things that are different is refreshing. The non-stop action makes it hard to put down. Can't wakeful start reading the next in the series.
3,Fun Factoids,This book is a fun little trivia book that you can breeze through in a couple of hours. It lists various unlikely things in the environment that can potentially cause illness. I would like to see something that fleshes the entries out a bit more though. A bit more about these odd dangers and what to do about them would be more interesting.
2,Step count is terrible.,I recieved the Eddie Bauer pedometer (with fm radio) for Christmas and have tried it several times. The closest it comes to my correct step count is plus/minus 10%. That's a 20% range. The clear button also clears my step count if I accidently bump it. It should be protected. The made in China sign on the back tells me they probably import these for about $5.00 each. What garbage.
4,Get it before there gone!!!,The best graphics and distars I ever encountered. Advisours give you information why and when you should entact or take out an ordinace.
2,Sim City 3000,"The initial problem is just to survive especially in some of the scenarios. Once you learn to balance building resources, disposing of waste, enacting laws, etc. your city grows and cash comes in and you have mostly happy sims. However, after mastering the basics, that's about all that happens. Factories, power plants, etc. age and must be rebuilt, waste disposal is a constant problem. With no scoring or rating system there is no way to effectively judge your progress at learning the techniques of playing the game. After several looooong games it gets boring but it's probably worth the price."
5,The trump card of its genre.,"SimCity 3000 improves on everything in the previous version, and adds new elements that in turn bring out one of the most realistic and entertaining strategy games out on the market today."
1,Don't bother with this version anymore,"As you may know, Maxis has released a new version of SimCity 3000, dubbed SimCity 3000 Unlimited.... The new features, like tile set switching, a map editor, scenarios, and even a scenario creator are more than worth the extra $.NOTE: The one star is not for the quality of the game; in fact it is my personal favorite, it is just that there is a better version avaliable!"
3,Sim city 2000 is way better,I am a sim city fan but this is a really bad game compared to sim city 2000. 2000 was real great with tons of things to do and you had hours of amusement never getting bored. On 3000 I got bored really quick the game is way too easy and becomes really boring. There is no real challenge. If you want a good city construction game go buy sim city 2000.
2,Nice try maxis,Maxis made everyone get excited about nothing I have a fast computer but everything takes forever to process. Maxis should admit they screwed up and try to give us a 4000 that is more than just better in graphics.
4,It is fun,"SimCity 3000 was a nice game, it has good graphics ,good sound, but all simcity 3000 is an upgraded simcity 2000. Still very fun!"
3,another one?,"I must say this one was better than the 2nd but it was not better than the 1st. I thought the actors could have been better but it was an ""ok"" movie."
3,Winstead,"I love Mary Winstead. Other than her, this is just a typical horror flick. Not as good as the original Final Dest but not as dumb as the second."
3,Stop at 3,"It's still entertaining. But, the more sequals that emerge, the more predictable it gets. You know kinda like WWE. Now don't get me wrong Championship Wrestling is not ffffffffake? Just predictable."
5,EXCELLENT MOVIE! -SPOILERS-,first off this movie rocks! it's a bit better than the first and so much better than the second. though each film has it's best moments. FD1 has terry getting hit by a bus best death seen. FD2 was the pipe in the head and the reason FD3 is the top at death seens is because it has more gore topping up all three movies with the alexz johnson (instant star)seen with her getting the nail gun through the head. best qualitys of all three movies! best accident best death best plot best actors and best sequel also if a director sees this review pleeeaaaseeee make final destination 4. Oh and trust me readers if im asking for a sequel it must be good since I most of the time want to destroy all sequels so listen to me and buy this film youll thank me. oh and sorry about the punctuation im only 12. to me the review is fine if you can at least read it.
3,Final destination 3,"I liked this dvd, but i think final destination 5 was the best of the three i purchased. Again, the special effects are amazing"
1,I thought this movie blew serious chunks!,"I had seen the first two, but while this one followed the same you can't escape death pattern, I was rather bored and annoyed by it.Maybe it's just me, but it's not as good the THIRD time around..."
3,Cheesy Movie,"Final Destination 3 doesn't compare to part one. Part 3, seems really cheesy, by the actors expressions on their faces; and it doesn't seem as realistic as part one. The movie also seems reduntant with no creativity. The effects are great and that's about it."
2,Not as good as I hoped,"I'm a huge fan of the first 2, so when I heard they were making a 3rd one I jumped right on it. Unfortunately, the movie was very dissapointing. It had exactly the same storyline as the first one, except with less convincing acting. To be honest, the acting was horrible. I was really hoping that they were gonna do something different with the whole idea, like they did in the 2nd one...but, I was wrong. In the end, it had some decent death scenes but thats pretty much it."
3,Not as good as part one,"After seeing the second movie(which was a terrible mvie), to me, there was no hope for this movie. But I did go and see it and it did turn out to be o.k. I did like the death scenes. They were different from part one and two. And the storyline of this one was way better than part two. All in all, this movie was alright."
3,"Good for Gore, Bad for Anything Else...","By now, fans of the Final Destination films all know that the movie is all about the big payoffs: the initial disaster scene, and then each person's subsequent (and elaborately gory) death after escaping this scene. Well, the initial destruction scene in FD3 is nowhere NEAR as engrossing as the traffic accident in part 2. The roller coaster is somewhat hard to follow, and it's definitely tough to tell what's going on (or who's falling out even). However, the death scenes do manage to succeed in the ""that's so gross I can only laugh"" department.However, the rest of the movie is not as great as the first two. It takes almost 25 minutes for the initial roller coaster to crash, the movie is filled with strange ""picture premonitions"" that in retrospect don't make much sense, and they even throw an unnecessary reference to 9/11 in the mix...So, while the movie is definitely fun, it's also uneven and not as entertaining as either of the first two films."
1,Choose your fate feature is missing,"The choose your fate feature is missing from this Bluray even though it is ADVERTISED on AMAZON and on the case too. WB won't even return e-mails about this omission, I returned my copy."
3,The acting is horriable but overall entertaining,The acting was horriable but overall the deaths scenes where good and the movie was entertaing. The first 15 min was so bad it's almost as bad as to walk out of the theaters they draged it on and on and on (you'll be screaming at the screen to get on the rollercoster allready). The film gets good when the death scenes' start happening the death parts are really good and well done just like the other films. The acting was bad and I mean bad. The first film is still the best and the sequal was better but this film was still good and a must see if you seen the other films and the film is entertaining.
4,Worth buying,"Lortie's playing is very commanding throughout the disc, yet he handles the Etudes with care, gently caressing the melodies. My only complaint is that the recording sounds rather close and tinny at times."
4,Oscar Oves It,"Perfect combinationn for top feeding Oscar, his color looks good and he stalks them on thh surface. Good choice, nicce price.."
5,Absolutely enthralling!,"Kresley Cole has done it again with her book. No Rest For The Wicked brings two characters together in a contest. After Sebastian recognizes Kaderin as his Bride, nothing will stop him from claiming her, even if it means he leaves his secluded home to participate in a contest to prove his interest in her. This is a must read story :)"
3,good,"So many reviews already, just want to add my rating to overall score.One of those that I hate to admit to liking because it is just total romantic smut and so enjoyable. Not as strong as the other two but the games were a good backdrop for this series."
3,"Pretty good, not great","This is book 2 in the series. There is also a short story which preceded this series. The short story is in the book ""Playing Easy to Get."" The short story and this book 2 are about vampires finding their brides. Both stories were ok, but not that thrilling for me. This book has Sebastian who when human was a great warrier, had a scientific and intellectual mind, was shy around women and had never had sex. As a vampire, he becomes ""blooded"" when he meets his bride, a Valkyrie woman. Book 1 (A Hunger Like No Other"") was much more exciting! It was about a werewolf finding his lifemate. Book 3, (Wicked Deeds On A Winter's Night"") yet to be published, is about another werewolf which looks good. For me, the werewolf guys are more exciting than the vampire guys. Sexual Language: strong/erotic."
3,pretty good,These books do have a lot going on in them with the whole paranormal world being much larger than in other books I've read.
5,Non Stop! Thrilling!,I have eagerly awaited Kresley Cole's 2nd book in the Immortals After Dark series and I have to say I was not disappointed! Non stop action and the sexual tension between Kaderin and Sebastian... WOOH... does someone have a fan? Don't forget to read the excerpt at the end of the book for the 3rd book in the series... it sounds fantastic!
4,Just keep getting better!,"Loved this book, Kresley Cole has impressed me, usually as books go on they get worse or lose the plot or forget their original story. I love how each book is a different love story and always from both sides, and then it still ties into this overall plot that each book keeps setting up for a big finale. Can't wait to see how it all turns out."
1,thiz cd SUCKZ!!!!!!!!!!!,50 n hiz cd in tha club or whuteva u wanna call dat birthday song crap should shuv the CDs up Dr dre n Shady's azzez...i hate thiz song and i neva like thiz song...the reason im writing thiz review iz because YALL ARE BRAINWASHED BY RAP CRAP...All rap iz iz just R&B and club muzik that gotz alotta techno beatz...when i hear new rap...it shiverz me and disgust me how horrible rap haz turn into
2,Tea for Two.. imples to me I'll get a teapot and 2 sets of cups/saucers,"Waht I find odd for this item, is that the title is ""Tea for Two"" when it should just be ""Teapot, cup and saucer"" It woudl be even better if the option to purchase a separate set of cups and saucers that match the teapot would be available so one can really have a matching ""Tea for Two"" set."
1,very disappointed,"I wanted this book for a long time and was very disappointed with it once I started reading. The problem, as other reviewers have mentioned, is the poor editing. It's not just a mistake here and there, it's every other page. Sometimes it's difficult to even understand what the author is attempting to say. I am very interested in pirates, so I was happy to find this book. But upon reading it, I decided it's definately best to page through before buying."
1,Save yer gold!,"Do not buy this book!I have an extensive nautical library and have done more than my share of research on the sea in general and pirates in particular. This book is so horribly written and filled to the brim with typos that I cannot recommend it to anyone. There are out and out errors which do not give me any faith at all in the author; the things I am not sure about, I simply cannot be sure about. That this author has fourteen other books in print scares me; the tide of typos could sink a battleship. I am not sure whether I will return this book for a refund, or set fire to it; the latter would be far more rewarding."
1,It is NOT the new book,"I bought the Japanese Vol 1 book as new, however it is NOT the new book. It is use and missing a CD for listening quiz."
3,OK,"OK, but some transitions were a bit forced/abrupt, and (of course) the technology dated. Better than TV........Here's a few more words to make 20."
3,revue1,"The Gripping Hand was a sequel to A Mote In God's Eye, but where Mote was readable over and over because of character and plot development, Gripping Hand was rather forced and tiresome....in my opinion. I would like to read Footfall by the same authors but I can't find it on Amazon for Kindle."
2,Not as exciting as the first; Very slow to start,"Went with this based on the positive experience I had with the previous book. I found myself plodding along not getting anywhere, all the way to 50% mark of the book. Then suddenly, the plot took off and I finished it. The experience was so bad that I have no desire to check out the supposed third installment, ""Outies"". This book is nothing more than a expanded epilogue to the first book!"
2,"a medicore knockoff, not a creative continuation of the great first novel","I just spent the afternoon reading this after feeling mesmerized by the first one, Mote. It was terribly disappointing. OK, perhaps not a pure commercial potboiler, but vastly inferior to the mysteries and utter fascination within the first one.In this, you know the problem: the aliens, by their biology of uncontrolled population increase, are a terrible threat to mankind. But ah, humans have been able to experiment with some of them for decades; the deus ex machina solution that emerges after some spectacular fighting is, to say the least, a letdown. Everything else is needless detail. That makes this a profound scifi dud, lacking the magic of the original.Not recommended, except for uncritical cultists."
3,A step down from the Mote in God's Eye,"A decent enough book, continuing the story from the Mote in God's Eye. The plot and pacing are decent, the characters not particularly impressive ... I can't say it's a bad read, because it's not. But I can't say it was a great read either."
3,don't think this is really useful for me,"The reason why I bought this was to replace the non-stick pan I have, thinking that it's healthier to use a stainless steel pan...HOWEVER, this pan heats up too quickly and burns the food too often. I read a lot of reviews about it before I made the purchase and most of them are good. I don't know why. Maybe I didn't get it right...anyway, it now sits in my kitchen and I don't know when I'll have the ""courage"" to use it again and I am going back to my non-stick pan again..."
5,Good quality pan,"I've had this pan for a few months now and use it quite often. Though it is not a non-stick pan, the food doesn't really stick and clean up is easy. Just pre-heat the pan with low heat before adding your food and you should be OK. It has a nice heavy feel to it and is a very good looking piece of cookware. Most stainless cookware will have some discoloration on the bottom even after just one use. If you want to get rid of the discoloration and keep your cookware looking new, there's a product called Bar Keepers Friend cleanser that does an excellent job (I ordered mine at barkeepersfriend.com, or you can pick some up at Linen and Things.)"
4,Good Value,This is a nice pan for the price. It's big enough to saute dinner for four. It produced a nice brown crust on my food.
5,Big enough to cook a turkey - Solid build and heats evenly... Serves double duty as a gong,"I got this $100+ pan as it was on sale for less than $30 - When the package arrived in a box big enough to fit a baby carrage, I had no idea what was inside... Opened it up to find this pan and its MUCH larger and heavier than I expected!Convenient for frying up large portions and the thick aluminum core base heats everything up very evenly. The quality is almost as good as an All-Clad with just slightly thinner walls but feels totally solid/heavy and definitely built to last.I can fit it over and use 2 burners on my small NYC apt stove to heat it up twice as fast though lol!I have it hanging on the wall next to my stove and it looks like a silver gong lol!"
5,Love these pans,After using Circulon pans for the last five years what a pleasure cooking with the Cuisinart stainless steel pans. The double handles are very user friendly and they look and cook great. The flat bottoms work great on my cooktop. They claim you can put them in the dishwasher but I have not tried that so far. Overall they are the best pans I've had in many years.
3,TOO BIG,GREAT VALUE BUT I WISH THAT I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT THE 12 IN 14 IN IS WAY TOO BIG FOR MY REGULAR GAS STOVE BURNER AND TOO SMAL FOR TWO BURNERS. GREAT LOOKING PAN BUT ALSO HARD TO STORE. WILL USE FOR PAELLA(SPANISH RICE DISH) AND BROWNING BIG PORTIONS OF CHICKEN.
3,its ok,The pan is a little thin so it heats up real fast so if your using an electric stove its a little too hot or not hot enough. Pans with a copper base have been better in my opinion. At least its balanced & stays level.
5,Very Pleased,"I purchased this as my second pan purchase from the Cuisinart Chef Classic series. I have had both for about six months and could not be happier. I read all he reviews and was wondering is it going to stick, it it going to be hard to clean, ect and all I can say is this:It cooks food evenly and as long as you rinse with water and a little dishsoap before it cools clean up is a breeze. For tough jobs let it soak, then sprinkle a little stainless steel cleanser.A great quality pan for a good price!"
4,It's a good quality pan.,"I've always had a cheap pan for frying sauteing and so on. I've been cooking more at home recently and decided to try a better quality pan. My normal cheap pans need to cook hotter and they tend to have hot spots. This pan really surprised me as I have to cook on a much lower temperature. The pad conducts the heat really well (I currently use an electric stove but suspect it would work the same way with gas), seems to do an unusually good job at distributing the heat evenly, it's substantially better then any cheap pan I've ever used. This pan *is not* non-stick but you can use a scouring pad and not damage it like a non-stick type. My recommendation to a would be purchaser to consider the same quality pan but with a non-stick ceramic coating, I think Cuisinart makes one gonna try one this year. Happy cooking!"
2,cuisinart skillet,I don't care for this product. I have not used stainless cookware for years and I find it leaves outlines from the food and must be polished everytime I use it.I would not purchase another one.Vicki Lea Fey
2,Don't know,Didn't have a chance to use it since I returned it soon as I got it.There was a noticeable dent in the rim (lip) of the skillet. The lip is very thin and appears to be easily deformed. Wouldn't recommend this product.
2,Pan is tiny!,"It looks like some of the reviews are referencing the 12"" or 14"" versions. I've got the 8"" version, which is comparatively smaller than I had been expecting... It's a small little pan capable of frying two eggs, but not to cook most ""dinner"" type dishes...Cooks just fine."
3,Ok,"Its an OK product. It is great for making small dishes, however you will be hard pressed to try and make 2 hamburgers side by side (wont fit). The product is well made. I would have liked a slightly larger item, but otherwise its OK."
3,A little smaller than I expected!!,"A little smaller than I expected, but it still look nice and good.I find that often food will stick even if i use a lot of oil. Hrmm..not sure why.I bought this together with Cuisinart Chef's Classic Nonstick Hard-Anodized 12"", and I like the non-stick more. The reason is use less oil and dont have to wash after used."
3,NOT GOOD,"FOOD STICKS IN IT REAL EASY, GOOD QUALITY WOULD NOT STICK I AM NOT CRAZY ABOUT IT BUY A DIFFERENT BRAND"
3,I've been had,"Ahhh! I think I've been had. Bought this on eBay and it burns easily. Does not wash easily either. I switched to good quality stainless steel pans some years ago and have been phasing out my non-stick pans. I found that it is really important to purchase only high quality stainless steel and Cuisinart Classic is at the bottom end of that class.I have several good Cuisinart pans but this one is not of the same quality. It developed a discoloration on the edges at the first use that won't scrub off. Each time I fry an egg, I have to scrub long and hard to get it clean. I use a plastic, non-scratch scrubber. This was not a good purchase."
5,Skillet Dream,"This skillet is perfect in every respect. Nice solid bottom surface that hugs the flame (or burner) without warping. Goes from stovetop to oven, an absolutely requisite feature. Cleans up prefectly, even after a good burning from leaving the heat too high, too long. Non-stick surfaces don't last. This stainless skillet will last through your great-grandchildren's gourmet cooking challenges. After everyday use, it still looks new."
2,Not impressed,"I was looking for a light weight attractive white set that I could use for big gatherings instead of real china or the really flimsy plastic dishware. These are white and that is all I liked about them. I wouldn't even like them for my rv. I took them out, thought them cheesy and since it isn't worth the price to return, promptly gave them away. I still haven't bought any yet. I did go ahead and purchase a caterer's set of dinner plates (real plates) for the holidays and love them (they were from the pottery barn and rather spendy but I bit the bullet and got them)."
4,Headline,Got what was ordered and expected in timely fashion! word word word word word word word word word word word
4,Fun lights and sound,I think my boys were more into the lights and sounds and pretending it was a rocket that playing with the figures that go with it. It's a cute toy though and they did play with it a lot till they outgrew it (at about 4 years old).
3,cute but could've been made alittle better,Cute toy but the door to the cockpit comes off real easy. My 2 yr old boy took it off w/in the hour.
4,Lots of Fun!,My three and five year old boys got this toy a couple of years ago and they still love playing with. It's held up pretty well except that the door to the cockpit broke off.
4,Tapestry Romance #8,"All of these tapestry romance are pretty good.From the back of the book:She was torn by her love for one man and her debt to another,""BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR.""Maura's father had warned his lovely blond-haired daughter. But in 1890. Maura found a way to escape from the slums of New York to the palaces of Newport. When Peter VanDiver asked for her hand in marriage, she accepted.As a new life beckoned to her, as she walked down the aisle to join her future husband, her eyes were caught and held by a amn she had never seen before. But whom her heart recognized instantly."
1,"Spoiled Brat, Little Insight","What a spoiled brat! Her parents spend thousands of dollars to send her to fat camp and she does is whine, whine, whine. She lives a priviledged life in New York as the only child of wealthy parents, and she just totally, like, hates it when her parents gently encourage her to eat healthily and lose weight.The book is boring. She does not provide any background, any insight, or any discussion of how she became overweight. She merely describes clothes, food, exercise and a camp romance. She does lose weight, and grudgingly concedes that she feels better when she exercises and eats well.Brat."
2,Fat camp,"um this book came fast but i have to admit, itz very boring. i didn't finish reading it and i dont want to to.. no conflict and very little emotions..."
1,Kept me awake!,"This didn't work for me--just the opposite, in fact. Whenever I managed to doze off, the annoying vocals on this CD jarred me awake again. Thumbs down.I returned the CD months ago and still haven't received a refund (from the company, not Amazon). They did not respond to email or return my calls. NOT HAPPY! Caveat Emptor. :-("
1,STINKS!,I've tried this litter and I really disliked it! I've purchased it because it was flushable. That was the biggest mistake. The litter stunk so bad when the cat urinated in the litter. A friend told me it smelt like rotten meat. Another thing I really dislike about this litter is when it clumped up it was HARD as a ROCK! I broke a litter scoop trying to get it off the sides. I would not recommend this litter to anyone. Now instead I use Nature's Miracle cat litter.
1,Applicable for Men Only,"Maybe I didn't read prior reviews, but I bought this for a girlfriend that was turning 50, and it is completely written towards men, not women."
5,"Names, names and more names!",This is really a great book to help you name your new cat! I wish I would have had this book when we adopted our cat. (Would have come in handy to pick an appropriate name that fits her personality!) It will definitely help with the next one! Observe your new cat for a few days and then go through this book. I guarantee you'll find the perfect name for your furry friend!
4,king,This toy came when expected and was actually better than described. It is made very well and seems to be very durable.
2,Not deep enough,"While the sheets themselves are wonderful, if you are the owner of the higher end Sterns and Foster mattress, they don't fit."
5,Beautifully written,"This book will remain in my memory for a long time. The writing style, the vividness of setting, emotions, relationships, and timeframe, all come together to pack a powerful punch to the reader. My son and I could not put it down."
1,bad phone,"This phone is terrible. It advertizes itself as a 900 MHz, but really has no more range than your typical phone with a cord. It randomly hangs up on people, and the distortion is sometimes so bad that it is unusable. NOT a good buy."
1,Horrible answering machine!,"I purchased this phone a year ago. The answering machine has never worked well. It randomly cuts off messages and blanks out in the middle of messages. I'm so disappointed, unfortunately I did not keep my receipt! Lesson learned!"
5,mafia and revolution,"I enjoyed this book very much. I originally picked it up because I am interested in the mafia and wanted to find out more about its origins. The book is very useful for this, and describes how the mafia started in Sicily's struggle for freedom. It is very well-written, I read it in a couple of days, and has a lot of interesting stories. I especially liked the description of Garibaldi in Sicily and the stories about how some of the Sicilians who fought on Garibaldi's side later became capimafia. Thew author is also interested in the relation of violence and crime to revolution. I wasn't looking for this when I started the book, but I think it is an interesting subject. If you look at a lot of recent revolutions, it's clear that the question of what is revolution and what is crime comes down to the question of which side you're on. If you like it, it's revolution; if you don't like it, it's crime."
3,"Poor printing quality detracts from a great book, won't buy","I bought this book and ws really disappointed when I leafed through more thoroughly and found MANY of the illustrations were out of focus, and one had a HUGH printer error where the image was blocked on one of the printer's colors.I returned this book and have repeatedly looked at it at the book stores to see if a re-issued copy comes out that corrects these problems. My estimate is that there are 7-8 plates that are defective."
5,This book has been loved to pieces by my three daughters.,"There is more tape than paper holding this book together now because my three girls have read it hundreds of times. They all giggle uncontrollably at the part where Trixie goes boneless. The expression on the dad's face when the mom asks the seemingly obvious question (Where's Knuffle Bunny?) is hilarious--both parents and children can appreciate the humor. I also like the monochromatic urban backdrop, which sets off the bright cartoon drawings.I tend to enjoy the more subversive kids' books, like The Stinky Cheese Man and Cautionary Tales for Children, but my kids senses' of humors tend to be a bit lighter. Mo Willem's style is a perfect compromise. No princesses, but no gallows humor either."
5,knuffle bunny,This is an instant favorite in our house! The mix of photo and drawing keeps my 2 y.o. enthralled. Great story about a girl and her lovie. My little one can relate!
5,We love this book!,"My husband, myself, and my 2 yr old daughter love this book. When we are done, she says, ""again?"". That is always a good sign!! This is not her ""favorite""..right now, but ""favorite"" is find colors, shapes, or counting books. This book is funny, you will enjoy reading it again and again and your child will like it too."
3,Kyle Kelley's book review on Knuffle Bunny,"Knuffle Bunny, a well-writen book by Mo Willems, and also illustrated by Mo Willems, is a sort of humorus book for 2year olds to first graders. It is about a little girl named Trixie who is running an errand with her dad. Through out the way to get to the laundromat she is carrying a little green stuffed bunny. After they got there, Trixie was playing around in the laundry, and lost her beloved rugged bunny. Although, it shows it in the pitchers little Trixie never relizes what she's missing, untill, half way home. She tries to tell her dad but she's too little to talk. If you would like to know what happens next in this well illustrated mix of real life backgrounds and very thought out cartoons, Read Knuffle Bunny.By Kyle Kelley"
3,"Eh, it's ok . . .","I know Mo Willems has a caldecott for his pidgeon book, but this one about the MIA bunny toy is not particularly engaging. My nearly 2 yr old daughter likes it ok, but it's not a favorite. I think it's a bit overrated."
5,Very creative and fun to read.,"Oh what a cute story. I read this to my 4 year old boy, who usually only likes stories about trucks, planes, bugs, etc. I wasn't sure he'd like a story about a little girl who left her bunny at the laundromat.So, what did my son like about it? He really liked the real pictures as the background. I think it's hard for him to figure out books that use abstract drawings, especially like those found in many Dr. Seuss. He' a problem solver and likes straight-forward books and this didn't dissapoint.He was also able to figure out what Trixie's problem was, almost immediately. This is excellent because he's dealing with a little brother who does not talk yet."
5,Precious!,"Knuffle Bunny won my heart the first time I read it! Each time I have read it again, I've loved it more! The art is terrific with real photographs forming background for the cartoon characters! (I think it should have WON the Caldecott rather than being an Honor book!) Anyone who's ever loved a toddler or remembers being a toddler will treasure this book!"
5,Love this book!,Great book! My girls love to read Knuffle Bunny and Knuffle Bunny Too. It is a wonderful story and great illustrations.
5,Great Collection,"This is a great collection of songs ranging from rap (Goodie Mob, Q-Tip), R&B (Angie Stone, Pink, TLC, Next) and there's not one bad song. This Cd has some of the most talented and popular artist today. If you like urban music and bang for your buck, pick up this Cd. This is going to stay in my collection for a long time!"
2,Beware,"Becarefull, despite that it states it twice on the product name, this motherboard is NOT sli."
3,Just okay,A bit hokie. Wasn't the worst I have seen but definitely not the best. Good for a night when you can't find anything else.
5,WONDER WOMAN WONDER GREAT,"GREAT THE ALL TIME GREAT SUPERHEROINE.The Return of Wonder WomanTHE INSTANT VIDEO IS IN MY OPINION HAS BETTER PICTURE QUALITY THAN THE DVD,IT WAS DOWNLOADED WITH THE GREATEST OF EASE<FAST DOWNLOAD TIME. THANKS AMAZON."
3,Wonder Woman on the Cheap,"We really enjoyed and purchased Season One of Wonder Woman. That's the one where Wonder Woman fights the Nazis and engages in plots of grand scale. Season two did away with the need for all those period costumes and sets, placing Wonder Woman in or around Los Angeles whenever possible, in the 70's, mostly taking on small tasks. We watched the first disc of the season from that online rental outfit and decided this Wonder Woman was not as good a role model for our daughter. Stick to Season One for the best stories and characters."
5,wonder wonder woman 35 years later,"well a.b.c. let wonder woman go and c.b.s. picked her up but not before loseing the world war II theme which caused problems because of having to find period pieces and costumes. so wonder woman leaped 35 years into the 70's thankful for us the beautiful and talanted lynda carter returns as wonder woman along with lyle waggner as steve trevor jr. i loved this show growing up as any teenage boy would, but it really is a fine sci-fi show and had some great plots. so sit back and time warp with the sexiest superhero to ever come down the pike!!!"
2,Lowrance iWay 350 gps,Unit works well but the manual shipped with the unit was for the older software. I checked the Lowrance web site for an updated manual but there wasn't one. The differences in the new software took a while to figure out. If a correct manual were available I would have rated the unit 4 stars.
3,dissappointed,"This system lies in its specs:it says it can avoid interstates. this is blatant lie. It will always put you on interstate if route is shortest, it will even mae you do a u-turn to get on interstate even if you slide it to avoid.no update for 350c but for 500c says that they dont care about those who spent a little less.company updates to little, they say you can update maps and poi but they rarely do, even when new streets and buildings added eevry day.you have to spell street names exactly! this is blantant bad development to cut costs.in ending, DO NOT BUY THIS OR ANY PRODUCT from this company. unles sofcourse you want to shell out 1000 dolalrs for their highr end models, those they will update.the end."
5,One of the Great Collections of Nature Essays,"Set in a small farm house on a Cape Cod marsh in a the 1940s and early 50s, it portrays the Cape in a time before masses of visitors changed it from an isolated backwater to an overrun tourist destination (a change that seems to have taken over so many parts of our country). I spent summers on the Cape as a young boy in the late 50s and early sixties, and Richardson's writing brings back that sense of wild emptiness and special light that used to make Cape Cod so special. The writing and lovely illustrations recall a time when you could have a hand in the gathering of your own food and take joy in the beauty of the process. We have gained much smugness and lost so much else since then; the House on Nauset Marsh brings back a sense of how lives connected to nature used to be."
1,Can't hold a candle to Thoreau or Beston,"I picked up this book looking for a unique, personal perspective on life on Cape Cod. What I got was long-winded discussions of fishing. If you're into long descriptions of and justifications for fishing and duck hunting--you might like this book. The book is also annoyingly written. The author switches voice all over the place: back and for from ""I"" to ""you"" to ""one."" I found that very distracting. He doesn't seem to know that much about the Cape either. If you want ruminations on the quiet of nature--don't bother; try Thoreau's Cape Cod or Henry Beston's The Outermost House."
5,ExpensAble took the headache out of reporting my expenses.,"I'm amazed how ExpensAble took the headache out of reporting my expenses of my last business trip. With its expense entry Genies, it provided a sure-fire way getting all the expenses recorded - even the easy to forget costs like tips and toll fares. I would definitley recommend this to anyone who wants a quick and easy tool for recording and submitting their expenses."
5,A New York City veterinarian who made house calls,"There are a lot of extremely interesting stories about the vet's experiences, the pets he treated, and the people he interacted with. Although he specialized in cats, he also treated ""any animal that was suffering"". Some of the other animals were a pigeon, marmosets, honeybears, and ocelots. His clients were common people, millionaires, and celebrities, of which he includes some interesting insights. There are enough interesting stories in this book to keep anyone reading for some time whether they like cats or not. An excerpt from James and Pamela Mason's 1949 book, ""The Cats In Our Lives"" is excellent. It's their opinion of why people usually either love or detest cats."
3,It had potential,"I'm really not sure how I feel about the book. To me it started off really well had all this potential then as quickly as I got interested and couldnt wait to keep reading it became slow and dull. But then it picked up again towards the end. I probably wouldn't recommend this book to anyone unless you had absolutely nothing else to read. The slow parts were extremely difficult to get through for me, I only continued to read it because I was flying through it so I knew it wouldnt take me long to finish. So I guess I do know how I feel about this book, it's kind of like a #1 draft pick bust, so mich potential that goes to waste."
3,Almost Really Good....,"This book has a very interesting set up to the plot and then, as quickly as getting pushed from a cliff into an icy stream, it launches into a very impluasable series of events as successful architect Brad Denning tries to track down and find the little brother that disappearred from his life many years before and has now returned to steal his wife, his child and his identity. The little brother's motivation for doing this is poorly fleshed out and the eventual confrontation between siblings is so wildly implausable that at the end you find yourself shaking your head and wondering...""Now what the hell was that all about?"" I'd like to know the answer."
5,Whose Yur GRAND-daddy????,Jason and crew are the future of music NOW.The current Gods of sound got it going on....been following the edge for 40 years now and Jason has gone over it!Congrats and props to him.
2,i'll give it a 2 for effort...,"you know, i liked the song ""crystal lake"" a lot... when neil young did it in 1982 and it was called ""tranformer man""! once again, i really do not understand all the hoopla that is allegedly being hurled at this band. even if you've never heard neil young's ""trans"" album (which you should!), this calls to mind all too literally: pink floyd's ""welcome to the machine"", radiohead's last 2 albums, e.l.o., the film ""heartbeeps"", and the entire oeuvre of the flaming lips and mercury rev, all of which did this sort of thing MUCH BETTER than grandaddy (in my opinion, anyway). why can't we heap our praise on more worthy recipients like ween and the frogs?"
1,Garbage,"An absolute piece of trash. In real life, the actual Belka and Strelka were left out in space to suffocate when their oxygen fan out. Much like Disney's Pocahontas, Anastasia and others, this is just another piece of historical filtration for the sake of brainless entertainment.Graphics are third rate at best. Script is ludicrous. It gets worse from here!"
1,"Left me feeling like I'd just watched ""Love Story"" again.","Far better if I would have stopped with book three. The characters were developed in an interesting, entertaining, and enjoyable manner to that point. I've had enough depressing experiences in life and don't need to be reading a book that gives me another dose. Unfortunately I had already ordered the fifth book in the series. It arrived and I threw it on the shelf with no desire to read further."
4,"Real Ghosts, Restless Spirits, and Haunted Houses","If you enjoy reading true ghost stories, you will probably find this book by Brad Steiger an interesting collection. There are numerous stories, and many of them are quite creepy. On the other hand, the photos were less impressive. I am by no means an expert in photography, but I must say in all honesty that some of the photos included in this book appeared to be faked (and badly at that). This, in my opinion, somewhat compromised the credibility of the rest of the book. Apart from that, ""Real Ghosts"" still makes for a good read, especially on a dark and stormy night. In addition to this book, I highly recommend ""A Witch's Guide to Ghosts and the Supernatural"" by Gerina Dunwich. It also contains many true tales of ghost sightings and haunted places, and examines the paranormal from a neo-pagan perspective without forcing any particular belief system upon the reader."
1,Too much information!,"I am not a student of the occult. When I buy a book of ghost stories, I want it to be full of ghost stories, NOT research. When I got this book I was thrilled to see it was so large and now, two weeks on, I have barely made it past page 100. It's BORING! I WISH you gave more information about the books you sell."
1,This toy will turn a 4 year old into a PSYCHO!!,"This toy is sooooo annoying. At 38 years old, I was going beserk trying to get it to work properly. My 4 year old daughter got this as a gift for her birthday and when she saw how easily it fell apart when we were putting it together and then trying to play with it, she was in total agreement with me when I said it was garbage and that I was going to return it to the store. When you would get one door to stay in place, another door would fall off. Little tiny pieces fly every where when you try to close the whole thing and it pops open on you. Maybe mine was defective but it seems more likely to me that it is just a good idea for a toy gone terribly wrong!! If you find this toy to be as poorly constructed as I have, then don't hesitate to return it to the store you bought it at!"
5,Khachaturian Rules !!!,"The Khachaturian Piano Concerto is a blast. One of the finest pieces of 20th century music ever written and brilliantly performed by Orbelian. I loved this concerto the first time I heard it and it remains one of my favorites. This is Soviet-era music at its best. Khachaturian loved powerful rhythms and many sections are evocative of locomotives and heavy machinery. Although there is some mild dissonance in the music, it is pleasing and does not detract from the beauty in any way. The concerto is an emotionally charged work with a distinctive Armenian flavor and the second movement is pure poetry.In the Gayaneh Ballet and Masquerade Suite, the Scottish National Orchestra pulls out all the stops and is obviously having a rollicking good time playing these terrific pieces. In addition to his love of rhythm, Khachaturian had a remarkable harmonic sense and these pieces are replete with beautiful melodies and lush orchestration. Highly recommended."
4,Hidden costs of the wide screen,"Don't take me wrong - this TV is the great product. I use it in the kitchen, as everyone else. The picture is sharper and the colors are truer (in comparison, say, to LTM1755, which I owned briefly). But when I connected it to the old DirecTV receiver, the picture came out extended. So, I had to update the receiver, get cables (because this piece does not come with them), etc. If you want to use it mostly for watching non-HDTV programs in non-wide-screen format - don't get this monitor. Get Sharp instead it's less fussy."
5,How Paganism relates to modern culture,"Jouce & River Higginbotham's PAGAN SPIRITUALITY: A GUIDE TO PERSONAL TRANSFORMATION explores how Pagan spirituality relates to modern culture, presenting exercises to encourage readers to foster magickal skills and spiritual growth through journaling, visualization and meditation. Questions to discuss, exercises, and periodic plan analysis blend with divination and the art of receiving and understanding information from spiritual pursuits."
5,Must have!!!,"It's too bad this CD has been discontinued. Everything you could ask for in a CD. Upbeat dance tracks, the slow love tracks and all the in betweens. I love the track Lady...one of my favorites. He's a true R&B singer and is truly talented."
5,Good read for awd enthusiasts.,"This book was a fun read and a blast from the past with a great history lesson about hi performance cars through 1990ish. Group B Audis, Trans-Am Audis, and a 1st Gen Eagle Talon race team, covered in some depth and lots of b+w photos."
2,"Not real, erroneous biography","The film has a good intention in its conception BUT, the story is not true. This film presents a not real Mme. Curie as she was in her time.Her main field of study was radioactivity not X-rays.This is a partial and erroneous biography. There are other films more realistics, even as a cartoons, about Mme. Curie's life and about her great contribution to science."
1,Piece of junk!,"The jewelry box that comes with this set is a piece of junk. The drawer won't stay in and forget about the clouds staying on. It's pure frustration. Unfortunately, my daughter got it as a birthday gift, and we didn't get a gift receipt, so I didn't even know where it came from. We ended up throwing it away! Don't waste your money! You can buy the pony separately."
2,Have had one month and one is already broken.,"I love the size for our little dog but one of the two we have bought has broken already. The plastic loop at the top of the heart just isn't strong enough. It should be more durable if it is really going to serve it's purpose which is making our dog visible at night if she escaped. Until I find a better solution, though, I think I will just buy several of them and keep putting a new one on when one breaks."
1,Needs some design work,"This tag was much larger than I expected, but only had a tiny little space to write important information. Since you need to do it with some kind of permanent marker all I could fit was one phone number. No name or other words or information. My dog is small and the tag banged on the ground often and very quickly the clasp broke. It didn't even last one week."
5,Great Bang for the Buck,"For the price, a great value. Lightweight, but solid. Easy to install and works flawlessly."
3,breeding cats,"This book is ok, yet very dry and reads like a text book. There are better books out there so keep searching folks."
3,"Helpful, but not what I expected","This book is great if you want to learn about some of the additives that are in processed foods. I was expecting it to tell me if the additives were good or bad, and it does not do that. But it is very through and lists more things than I could imagine that get added to your foods, either good or bad. So take it shopping with you, and learn what you are eating. It will help you put a lot of things back on the shelf."
4,compact guide for travelers and planespotters,"Unlike most airplane guides, the compact 8.5 x 6.5"" format of this illustrated directory makes it handy for sliding in and out of a briefcase. Unfortunately, the book's materials and construction are not durable enough to withstand regular travel in this way.A very nice lineup of photos is followed by the specs of each of each aircraft, a knowledgeable survey of the plane and its development, and sections on 'variants' and 'service use'.Off-the-beaten-track followers will be pleasantly surpised to find the Tupolevs, Sukhois, Yaks, and Antonovs that are still common to the unreconstructed fleets of countries like Cuba and the former Soviet Union. I hasten to add that many carriers of these countries now have very young - mostly Airbus - fleets and very modern service standards.A fine book. A sturdier construction would earn all five stars from this reviewer."
5,Marvelous murals,"This book has alot of good information that both novice and pro alike will love. There are alot of techniques covered in this book and the authors cover them extensively. If you're thinking of making a carreer as a muralist, or just want to spruce of your own home, this is the book to start with."
2,Body Building No!,"The title of the book led me to believe that it was about the body building contestants life in general. It focused mainly on the ""sexual/seedy"" side of it. I skipped chapters and gave the book away."
3,Fun to play for a short period of time.,"As an adult, I believe this is a very educational toy laptop and the activities are very good for the age 3+. While I was playing it with my 2 1/2 old daughter, I can see she like to bend the activity cards more than the laptop itself. The Bee-shaped button is designed as an On/Off switch which is too easy for her to press. So, when she plays it, you constantly hear ""oh, bye bye"",""oh, bye bye""...repeatedly and she gets frustrated about it. She sighs and walks away from it in a short period of time.My suggest for this toy would be redesign the On/Off switch on the other places so that it won't be so reachable for kids, and make the activity cards more durable maybe thin plastic and not the thick paper card."
3,Easy read... but lacking much meat,"As I tend to go for LONGER books, this one was an appitizer to me. It was a quaint story.. that I devoured in less than a day. Easy reading.. Somewhat predictible story line.. that could have been rendered from a lifetime movie for sure. It does show the struggles of a 15 year old girl, and the thinking that she has (that we have all had)... But it also has a nice little pink bow ending.. and we all know that life doens't happen that way, however much we might really want it to.. However, if that is what you like.. a nice wrapped up ending with no strings sticking out.. this book is for you.It was a fine book, but not one of my top ten."
3,"Decent, cheap phones - they fit fine, they sound okay","These are decent inexpensive headphones. They sound okay, but somewhat muddled especially in the bass regions. They'd be a decent fit on a small head - I wear glasses and found that they pinched somewhat, pushing my ears against my glasses. My daughter, with long hair, tried them and said they kept slipping. There's not much else to be said: they sound okay, but not great, and they'd fit fine on the right-sized head of a guy without glasses or a girl with short hair."
2,Give this one a miss,"If you've purchased and enjoyed other French & Saunders DVDs, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed with this.This DVD features sketches from French & Saunders' 2004 BBC TV series. This series was a departure from earlier series in that it features sketches based on Dawn and Jennifer writing sketches, or rather, doing anything other than writing sketches at BBC Television Centre in London.Whilst there are some funny moments, and Lisa Tarbuck deserves recognition for playing French & Saunders' producer, the sketches are little too close to the truth. French & Saunders have, sadly, just seem to have run out of ideas."
4,Needs more new material,"Love the voice; have been following her since the we heard her duet with Jhonny Mathis (1978 - ""Same Time, Next Year"". Have heard her live, twice. Love the alblum, but wish she would put more new material in each alblum (thta's why it's a 4 and not a 5)."
5,Bears Street Sign,This street sign was the perfect stocking stuffer. It was one of many Chicago Bears Gifts given for Christmas and it is very well made and a nice addition to the Bears Fanatic collection!!!
1,Kindle version more expensive than paperback.,"The Kindle version of this book is more expensive than the paperback. Publishers should be railroaded for making such incredibly stupid decisions. There is no marginal cost for distributing a Kindle edition. No physical inventories to maintain, no ink to print, no paper to print on. Amazon handles the bandwidth. It's one thing when the price of the paperback is the same as the Kindle Edition, that's bad enough, but when the Kindle Edition is significantly more expensive, almost double the cost, that's ridiculous."
3,Not bad...,"""The Perfect Thing"" is a very light, shallow, but entertaining treatment of various aspects of the impact of the iPod product written by a ""technology reporter"" who does not seem to know much about his topic. The book is much better thaniPod, Therefore I Am, but is akin to it in that both are written by entirely uncritical fanboys. It would be nice to see a volume on portable digital audio players written by someone both savvy and neutral, but this is not one."
2,"Not ""Hackers""","I have read Mr. Levy's book ""Hackers"" several times. I found the information he supplied regarding the early days of computing very entertaining and of interest to me. This new book just hasn't grabbed my attention. I stopped after about 15 pages as it seems more like an Apple advertisement than an historical presentation. I realize there is not as much meat here to write about, but I really don't know why he bothered. It is not that interesting a subject, and probably was done just to cash in on his previous successes."
5,Infectious Song!,"Adrienne's 'Hypnotic Love' is a great song with a catchy chorus and great vocals. It has some hip-hop influences, and also combines elements of bubblegum pop, dance, and R&B. Jin's rap adds to the essence of the track. If you like this single, buy Adrienne's full length album 'Hypnotic.'"
5,Telescope for Birdwatchers.from Amazon,"Item arrived promptly, in good condition & as advertized. I use this scope primarily for birdwatching but also for star gazing occasionally. We were looking at the moons of Jupiter a few nights ago for instance. I also bought a sturdy tripod at the same time. This scope replaced a B&L from about 40 years ago."
5,Beyond my expectations,I bought the scope for bird watching and it is better than I expected. Since I have had the scope our nights have been cloudy except for one when I could see part of the moon and I was surprised at what I could see
2,Just OK,"Its just OK, my rifle scope was just as good at seeing .308 bullet holes at 200 yds.After 200 yds it struggles."
3,disapointing heat output,"I bought this hoping to supplement a heating pad that I have been using for years when I start seedlings in my sunroom in late winter and early spring. I was somewhat disappointed because this pad doesn't seem to heat as much or as well as the old one, the brand of which I no longer know. It will work, and seems to be the cheapest available in the size, but was also somewhat of a disappointment."
5,great product,"I actually bought this seedling mat for use in my chicken coop. Chickens are usually pretty cold-hardy, but I wanted to give them a little something to take the edge off of the cold on really cold days/nights. I placed the mat in the coop under the sand that is in the coop and plugged it in. Now on very cold nights, the chickens have a much cozier place to sleep. The sand on top of the mat is nice and toasty to the touch yet does not get too hot. (PERFECT!) The temp of the coop actually heats up to about 8-10 degrees warmer than outside from the mat during the day and at night I noticed it is even a bit warmer in there with the mat and their body heat. The chickens love ducking in and out of the coop now from time to time to warm up for a bit on cold days before going back out to scratch and play in their covered run. This is a perfect addition to their coop for the winter. Great product!!"
2,Heats fine but toxic plastic smell,They seem to heat fine but better to buy a heat mat with a control. These mats have a noxious plastic smell and it gets worse when you heat them up. I cannot use them in the house. I won't buy any more because of that.
4,Works well,I have one of these for germinating and use it with the Hydrofarm thermostat. Works great!
5,Helps seedlings root faster,This mat helped me regain lost time as i failed to start my spring garden seedlings in time for my normal first of June planting. By using the mat i recovered my two week delay and the plants were as healthy and large in a months time than the six+ weeks they would normally take. Very satisfied.
4,OK,Used this to clean windshield on my bike. Took several applications with power buffer but did improve clarity. Would use again.
4,Very Nice,"This is a very nice book for advanced artists. It is helpful in understanding different types of dragons and mythical creatures. It describes different body, head, and wing types. I would recommend this book for anyone who has a lot of interest in fantasy drawing."
5,Love it,Both very useful and has a nice little bit of humor inside. The tips on creating detail and position is very useful in creating a perfect custom dragon. This is a great book for everyone.
4,-,"These bars tasted good. A little too much fat and sugar, and they did not fill me up completely. However, it is one of the better non-fruit snack options I take."
1,Just another dumb sticker.,"I bought this sticker when I was heavily into eBay, and recently found it in a drawer of useless stuff, so I threw it away. No way is it going on my car's bumper."
2,Refurbished Products,Amazon is hit or miss on the items they sell. Probably 75% of the items they sell are returns or refurbished. Read the reviews on other products. It is hard for me to say that they do not know this. I am sure they do. If you return the first you are guaranteed to get a know one. I believe they dump the old before they send the new. Its systematic and calculative. This product was sent back and refurbished. I am sure they have a company that does it. Then they recycled this stuff to the public.
2,Never fully charged,We've tried twice to use this particular pack to jumpstart our cars. It's good that we still have AAA. It does have an accessory power outlet that we used once to charge up our cell phone!
1,Anecdotal Medicine,"Mr. McDevitt's treatise on Tactical Medicine is just that - a treatise. Although he covered many areas of tactical EMS, most were just touched upon and certainly not enough information was supplied to educate uneducated or to inform the active practitioner. The book has no scientific references. It appears to be purely anecdotal. Any firm fact to be found there is interspersed with unfounded opinion. To the uninformed, the difference between fact and opinion would be difficult to sort out, to say the least."
1,?2011 the inserrt is different than the original copy,"Years ago I bought this and it was a stand-up comedy routine that was a RIOT! I just got it again, and it has 5 different not funny at all short speaking things. I threw it out. He's my favorite comedian and I'm confused as to what happened to the other older routines???"
5,"""As clasic as Eddie Murphy's Delirious""","I am not one to purchase movies or give reviews in fact this is one of only 5 DVD's I own.Godfather, Goodfellas, Holy Grail, Friday, and Gaffigan...Both Gaffigan DVD's Are ""Classic""! I only hope he can come up with a follow up to King Baby that is just as good.--I am adding King Baby to my collection today."
2,Inner Voice = Annoying,"The reviews on this being an entertaining piece of stand-up is a fair assesment. Though Gaffigan will not offend many people or shock anyone out of the room, the inner voice bit is annoying to no end. For every joke or comment he makes he adds a high-pitched ""inner voice"" comment. The crowd appears to be puzzled by this as well and he even makes fun of himself for doing it...in the annoying inner voice pitch. It is a clean stand up set and the jokes are of run of the mill situations, mostly about food and other average things. I did not relate to much of his humor. Im willing to bet that not many will be wowed by his genius or delivery."
5,"New Gaffigan DVD ""King Baby""!! March 29th!!","I watch a lot of comedy DVDs, it is perhaps my favorite form of performance and entertainment. Jim Gaffigan is one of the most originally funny comics out there today. Its unbelievable the wit and humor Jim brings to sometimes simple aspects of daily life (or daily meals!). Even more amazing is that he doesn't stoop to the level of a lot of comics who just yell obscenities while yelling about sex.Jim returns this March 29th with his new special ""King Baby."" I recently saw in LA his new set that constitutes the special and it is GREAT! A must for any bacon lover![...]"
5,Funniest man on the planet!,"A friend of mine back in college enlightened me to Jim Gaffigan. Then I saw Super Troopers in '02, and realized Jim was in it..'Meow'. Then I saw him on That 70's show. And then, I saw his stand up. I have cried from laughing so hard, not that often in my life, but this was different. This was the kind of laughing that made you cry, and catch your breath, and seriously, I coudlnt, and still cant get the smile off my face when i watch, or think of his comedy. Seriously, eat all the fast food you want, cause they say a smile is 40 cals, think about it. This dvd is a must own. I cant believe how inexpensive it is. And for all you losers who download this and any other content for free. May you all burn in hell."
4,...,"My ecology class took a trip to Starved Rock and my teacher took us down into the canyon that the murders took place and gave us the story of it. What the book did not mention was a little fact but nothing too major, after the murders happen, the killer ingraved his name on the sandstone and it read ""ROCKEY"" in huge letters, just a little tidbit of it."
5,The best book in the world,I meet Steve Stout and it is cool how he wrote the book and how he started. My life has changed after reading this book. Now I want to go to Starved Rock to see where it happen and ask the people there if they have any information on it. I am telling you to read this book. IT IS COOL!!!!
2,Yic,"Most of it was good, but the parts that were bad were so damaging to the overall integrity of the book that I'm giving it two stars. The only part I felt was really worth reading was the chapter filled with men talking about why they preferred big women, but I'm definitely unimpressed.She gets my tentative applause for putting a book out on this subject to begin with, but Katie throws out totally conflicting messages. She talks about wearing a girdle on a date. Nuff said."
2,A Bit Dated,"Well, I researched the author and she isn't ""world famous,"" or even well known, for that matter. The writing is contrived and the overall feeling is that Katie is a big overgrown teeanager, pardon the pun. While we bigger girls need to stick together, I felt the advice was a bit dated."
2,Need something stronger,I am still looking for the best product to clean headlights. You will need a electric or battery powered buffer to get any results.
5,Great early reader for car-obsessed boys!,"My almost 5 year old son is learning to read rapidly, but there are so few books which he enjoys AND can read well. He was highly motivated to read Wheels, as he adores vehicles of all kinds. The format is very simple (1-2 short sentences per page)and includes plenty of long and short vowel words, as well as ""oo"" sounds and ""igh"" sounds. Hardly any words with 2 syllables."
3,Good for beginners,"I wanted to have a very basic telescope to take a photo for the moon, I found Celestron C90 good one even it's spotting scope. and it is so easy to operate. the focal lenght is 1200 mm .For the price yes it worth it."
5,Nature Valley Blueberry Yogurt bars,"REBEL AGAINST STRAWBERRIES. Every American thing with anything relating to fruit have strawberries in it. In Scotland, my favourite cereal is Special K Purple Berries. BUT THEY WON'T SELL IT HERE. INSTEAD, THE SELL RED BERRIES WITH STRAWBERRIES. I am sick of strawberries. I refuse to buy or eat anything with Strawberries in it. Buy Blueberries. CHANGE OUR FRUIT ! DON'T LET CORPORATE EXECUTIVES (strawberry weenies) PUSH YOU AROUND. FREEDOM !"
2,cheesy,"scope seems to be ok after i glued the rubber bac on the adj caps,and ring around the varible ring.it just seems that it was just thrown together in a hurry with no attention to detail. i guess it just goes to show ya get watcha pay fer."
5,"Very nice scope, great cross hairs, easy to view.","I mounted this on aMilitary Law Enforcement Match Grade AR-15 M4 Carrying Handle Bead Blast Finish matches your upper receiverwith aNcStar AR15 Carry Handle Adapter Weaver Mount 51/2"" (MAR5). It stays on my AR really well and i got it sighted in to 150 yards today. It's easy to shoot moving targets at that distance with the nice cross hairs."
4,Great flashback!,"Diana Prince was an awesome heroine. It great to watch the old series. Lasso of truth, invisible plane and the iron curtain, oh my! Watch for the nostalgia not the production values."
5,He charges more than anyone else and he's worth it!,"I have attended his workshops, purchased his books, tapes, videos, etc. He practices what he preaches -- I have paid up to twelve times as much to attend one of his workshops. They are not high tech...in fact, they look like they are done on a very tight budget. However, you leave his meetings feeling like you got every penny's worth. Likewise, this book -- although much more expensive than comparable books -- is worth the price! I'm not selling the book. I'm not affiliated with the author in any way. In fact, I'd say he can be quite annoying, but if you read this book and believe and follow it, you will be able to significantly increase your income by charging more and getting it! Price is NOT what the customer wants...they want value. This book is a value!"
5,Sports Bag is a gift and baby is not born yet.,This is such a cute toy and we purchased it for our grandbaby that is due to be born this week.
1,Oh Well...It is the Internet.,I was so excited to buy this item because it was the first time my son was going to be on a soccer team. This site portrays that this item is much bigger but it really isn't. My 3 year old sons shoe did not fit in the bag. One shoe did not fit let alone two!!! Also the little balls that come with it are a joke! They are foosball or ping pong ball size!!Very disappointed but that is what i get for buying from the internet. If i would have seen this at the store i would not of spent the 20 something dollars that i spent!!! PLUS SHIPPING!!!!
4,cute!!,"Super cute little bag and each of the balls has a different texture inside for the baby to feel (crinkle, etc) and the soccer ball actually makes a noise when it's dropped and whatnot."
3,Nice table but know the limitation,"This is a very nicely put together table with lots of accessories. It also has a large working surface and is pretty solid. Got one table and it had received a ding during shipping. Amazon shipped another (great service) but that too had a small shipping ding. I will have to work this out with Amazon. But that is not the problem. The table does not use a metal plate to mount the router. Rather, you mount the router on a special plastic plate/disc which is then recesses mounted into the MDF table top. This means you loose approx. half the height of the router bit due to the thickness of the mounting disc + MDF table. This can be a problem for some or in some applications. I guess, you can try to pull out the router bit shaft a little, but I would recommend AGAINST doing so for safety reasons. I have advised Wolfcraft and look forward to hear what they have to say about it? So, I feel this the table is pretty cool but there is a design flaw."
1,junk,"I bought this turd from a box store 2 years ago cause I was in a pinch and needed a table asap. The fence is all plastic!!! If you plan on using it more than once don't get this one, trust me. Very hard to replicate cuts somehow..."
2,Arrived dirty!,"I was so disappointed when we opened the box to find a dirty case. Inside the case, the saw itself had sawdust & oil particles in every crevice. I understood it was a reconditioned piece, but assumed it would be at least cleaned up! On the first project it worked adequately - we'll see how long it lasts."
2,The Truth!,"This story is long and complicated. You actully get to read about Saya 3 times, they're few and far between and very short. If I were to some up this book in one word it would be Dry, very dry reading. I suggest not wasting your money."
3,"SLOW, SLOW, SLOW","This printer is the slowest printer I have ever had, my inkjet printer from 1993 is faster than this one! I don't know what the deal is with this printer! The quality is something to be desired too - it did not do to well a printing a ""PHOTO QUALITY"" print! Spend the extra money and trade up to the all in one printer by Dell!"
3,not bad - for a freebie,"I got this printer free with my laptop purchase, and it's not bad. Really. I have a b&w; laser printer for large documents, so I use this for color and smaller jobs. It's small enough that it's portable, so I take it with me on scrapbooking weekend trips. It's nice having a computer and printer of my own so I can do computer journaling for my book, and USB printers are horribly expensive.It's quirky and has occasionally eaten an expensive sheet of vellum paper or fed a sheet of paper crookedly, but since I use this primarily for scrapbooking, I can usually crop the errors out of the paper. But I've been able to print on oddly sized pieces of paper most of the time with no trouble, which is convenient.I can't speak to its photo print quality, but I get my digital photos printed at shutterfly.com. I would never trust my photos to this thing... :)"
1,Voice too shrill,"The technique is equal to Sutherland. The acting is superior to Callas. But her voice is in tiny, tiny. Too much edge and spread. At best she has to be amplified to be heard.At first hearing you are in awe. But after listening in person, you realize the voice is even inferior to Callas because it is just so small.She is a fine singer. But not in the league of Callas or Sutherland, or even Caballe."
4,It's OK,The safe seems sturdy enough. The problem we have is that the batteries on the inside come lose very easily. Then you can't open it with the combination. Therefore you have to insure to keep your keys close by and don't lose them. Then of course you have to reset the combination. Other than that it is ok.
4,Keepsake for the Keystone State,"Attractive, reasonably priced photo book on the Keystone State.Irwin, whose photography has appeared in National Geographic, is particularly good in his coverage of the plain people of Lancaster County. Irwin doesn't neglect any part of the state, however. An excellent keepsake for anyone living in or visiting this state."
2,"Useful, for what it is.","This preserves cookbook has useful recipes, but there is little new and exciting. The book does not discuss pH of jams and other information that one would expect in a modern-day jam-making book. Jar-sealing by inversion method is discussed as appropriate. From what I know, this is old school. According to the USDA, jars should be sealed by processing them in a rolling water bath...for safety sake."
3,nothing special,"These beads are just okay. They are equally as pretty as beads I have found at any craft store, I expected them to be more special. They are also about 1/4 the size I expected them to be (likely my misunderstanding). They are cute beads but I would need the entire lot of 500 to make even a small hat look pretty. I assume I would likely need multiple packs to create a dress, shirt, or any of the multiple craft projects I like to create. These do not suit my needs at all and will thus be sent back. If you have a good understanding of the size of the beads and if your indended project is a bracelet for a child, earrings, or other tiny project - these will most likely suit your needs. They are pretty. I should also mention that I wouldn't give these to a child (under 10 at least) because I think handling them would be frustrating and difficult."
5,Top quality product!! Highly recommended Crystals,My daughter loved these and they were top quality.
3,not the best out there,"Details, details, details. These are what is missing in the book. If one reads it carfully the USS Arizona is seen in action in Normandy. The Hanford Nuclear Reservation is in Oregon, And Stalin is easily reached. Also the use of jet bombers as fighters is bending the reality of just how the planes work. Also no mention is made on the Allied bomber campaign and its results in hammpering production. While some of the figures are close the aircraft ones are for the frames, not compleated fighters. Tanks and fuel also are not mentioned well. As to the elimination of Hitler, that is just a joke. Most of the political moves are also pure moonshine. All in all poor but still well written except for those annoying little details."
2,echhhhh...,"I'm not sure how many possibilities there are in infinity, but this one does not cut the mustard of alternative histories. (Hacknied at worst). Couda' been better...Rommel and the folk do not shine well within. A bit o' rose glasses and the best of the reich's generals and associated staffers and a 70-80's ""reich"" through very rose colored glasses. A good read, but one that is REALLY implausible...At least as seen in retrospect and through a quasi-historian's eyes...."
1,have not received,It would help if I had the item to be able to review it. I have not received this item.
2,Not the greatest,"This book is not what I would consider Victoria Holt's greatest. I have read several of her books and found the 'Curse of the Kings' to be dragging. I usually read her books in about two days and to my surprise this book took me about a month. If your planning to purchase this book, I would recommend that you dont."
5,An indispensable addition to your computing,Wow! WOW!! These speakers are just simply beyond belief. They make listening to your computer and watching DVD's an other worldly experience. I've had many different types of speakers in my computing life and these are simply by far the best. ...
5,A Very Satisfied Music Listener,I purchased these speakers a week ago and they sound better each day. This a great complement considering that from the first day I was unable to imagine how they could possibly sound any better. These speakers replaced a set of four of top of the line Boston Accoustics. I thought they sounded good until I heard these speakers. I prefer rock & roll played loud and this set of speakers deliver magnificently. I blew 2 sets of the Boston speakers that fortunately were replaced by the computer manufacturer. No problem with the Altecs'. They are superb at any range. I don't play games so am unable to comment in that area. Can't go wrong with these speakers if you enjoy listening to good music.
5,awesome speakers,"These speakers truly rock. They have a great all around sound, and they are pretty heavy duty. The casing is well built. The sub always shakes my floor!"
4,like it,I like this rack better then the ones with the quick release. This rack alows you to really clamp the rack down to keep it from moving. I use a little bit of rubber tabe so it doesn't scratch the seat post.
4,Great Rack .,"When the rack came from Amazon, there were only three (5mm Allen) mounting bolts. (Stuff happens) Figuring Amazon would have to send an entire new rack, I dashed off an email to each of two addresses on the Delta web site asking for a bolt. Didn't get a reply, but a bolt arrived in five days. I recommend this product and company."
3,Adequate...but should be more adjustable.,"I bought this beam rack for a used bike I bought this winter that did not have eyelets to fasten the conventional struts of a bike rack. It is sturdy and well made, but the angle of your seat post dictates the leveling angle of the rack platform, without any adjustment that I could find. The first time I installed the rack, the rear of the platform was tipped up at a sharp angle, not close to level. It was unusable as was, and looked stupid as heck. Through trial and error, I shimmed the seat post out with folded pieces of an old inner tube, and eventually leveled the platform. That done, it works well, and looks cool. Am I missing something, or is there a built in option for leveling this beam rack? If not, there should be.Also the bolts are soft aluminum and should be tightened with care to avoid stripping. Steel bolts would have been better."
3,Hikari Algae Wafers,I usually buy these for my plecos. The only thing I don't like is that these don't seem to last too long. I put algae wafers in my tank twice a day and it seems like I'm at the bottom of the bag a week after I open it :(
1,Rating Below Zero. Does not work at all,The mosquito deleto does not work at all. Mosquitoes fly around it but do not get stuck in the paper. I have had the deleto machine for a year and it has not done a single thing to reduce the mosquito population in my yard. Do not buy this product!!!!!!!!
2,boring,Always the same stereotypes of scenarios. Not a litle effort to work on the text.....No interest in that is not even a book
3,Not All That I Expected,"I was disappointed that there were only reviews of about five or six New Jersey colleges. I was expecting a larger representation. Schools such as Montclair and Ramapo were absent from the catalogue.I was considering returning the book, but there was other material in the book that could prove useful so I decided to save myself the trouble and just keep it."
2,Disappointed 2,"The software is very difficult to use and, as Kenny indicated, the software does not expand recipes so that they are useable! When inserting ingredients I found that the software ignores fractions of measures - a real problem! A support contact telephone number or web site would be helpful."
2,Every episode had a villain,"My 3 year old who LOVES CareBears, did not like these episodes. This was her first and only exposure to CareBears on dvd and she did not like any of the parts with the villains, which is a fair amount of each episode. I was so shocked she didn't love them, but our TV viewing has been very limited and with no ""scary"" stuff: Kipper, Little Bear, Beatrix Potter."
2,Technical examples of interesting physical experiments,"For every mathematician working with complex physic tests and a limited budget, this book can be useful. Unfortunately I am just a modeler of simple discrete event simulations, so for me this book was not very useful. Except for the first chapter that tells a little about different simulation methods, the book mainly contains very technical examples of interesting physical experiments. Through the whole of the book, lots of functions are included, which seem generic for any kind of proof with atoms or light differentiation. But in my opinion, the book does not add any value to persons that want to know how they can improve their tests using computer simulation in general."
4,A Book for Everyday,"These short vignettes are tiny capsules of truth and faith for the daily grind. The ideas are the author's random thoughts that he kept in his own journal each day. I have read several of his books but so far I have not found the profoundness of his other works in these daily snap shots. This is to be expected since he is not developing the ideas. Thus, the four star rating. His full length books I rate at five stars."
2,Sound and Sense is given more credit than it deserves.,"While I would not deny Perrine's and Arp's level of scholarly prowess in crafting this work, much of that scholarship is unnecessary and, at times undesirable. I used this book in my Advanced Placement English Literature class in high school, and I did not come away especially ""enlightened"" about poetry. Perrine and Arp seem to forget that the best poetry is inspired and should jostle thoughtful readers into philosophic contemplation. Any hint of this is lost in the way the authors dissect each work, measure it, judge it according to their calculus, and, in the process, strip it of its former beauty. Even the time honored works of Shakespeare, Donne, Dickinson, and other great poets come away with this seemingly undeserved black mark."
5,The Vikings: mecantile pirates or piratical merchants?,"Gwynn Jones traces the origins of the various viking communities and their settlements, with the Danes making inroads into England and France, the Norwegians into North England, Scotland, Ireland, Iceland, Greenland, and America, and the Swedes into Russia.I was particularly interested in the account of the Arab traveler Ibn Fadlan who describes the vikings he found in Russia as ""tall as date palms"". In addition, Ibn Fadlan's accounts depicts a culture that appeared to him as barbaric. ""A man will have sexual intercourse with his slave girl while his companion looks on."" In the event of the death of such a viking, his slave girl (after lying with her master's companions) then is ritually killed so that she might follow her master into the afterlife. The deceased viking, his sacrificed slave girl, and whatever else, is then burned in a longship."
4,Cheap...,Cheapest price on amazon. Works as specified. Only complaint is the plastic bracket that holds the membrane to the main metal bracket arrived broken. Couldn't be fixed with superglue so I guess I have to live without it.This unit as of 02/10/09 is over twenty dollars cheaper even with shipping than any other place I have seen it advertised
4,50's Style Horror with a 90's twist,"I enjoyed this movie. It had a nice creepy feel to it, and an interesting sort of retro style. It managed to convey a sort of scary undercurrent lurking in suburbia. Everything looking perfect, but feeling terribly wrong. It was set in the 90's but used a lot of 50's conventions (probably a nod to the original ""I Married a Monster from Outer Space""). The cast was a good one, and it had a nice build up as the wife finds out her husband is not what he seems. I'm waiting for this one to come down in price."
5,BUY THIS NOW!,"Don't ask questions, just buy this today. Pure entertainment, great guest stars, and the one and only JUDY."
5,JUDY JUDY JUDY,"These are truly shinning hours. Perhaps the best collection of an artist to appear on DVD. Judy is presented in suburb black and white with an outstanding surround sound that is devastating. The quest are wonderful with a special tribute to Vic Diamone, Dihanne Carroll, Lena, and Liza that top the list. The audience is even star struck. This is a rare chance to see the worlds greatest singer/actress at her best. These are not lost memories for they are reproduced here in better quality than you will ever see them, or have ever seen them before. WOW--can't wait for the second addition."
5,WOW!!!!Neat!!!,"Along with the other Bratz movies i ordered,my 10 year old granddaughter,is totallythrilled."
1,Waste of Money,"I am ammused that the products actually gives you the ability to chose one light or two. Even with both tube light own, it does not put out enough light to make product very useful. I got this to hang under the canopy over the picnic table when camping since it does not generate the heat of a propane lantern. However, it puts about as much light on the table as a night light. Plus, battery does not last very long. After charging it for sveral hours, the batteries gave out after less than three hours of use. Product is a waste of money."
2,REPLACEMENT BATTERY,"ONCE RECHARGABLE BATTERY DIES, ITS HARD TO FIND REPLACEMENT BATTERY, EVEN COLEMAN DO NO HAVE IT!"
3,Lasted 2.5 hours,"Guess I work a little harder than some people, because it's difficult for me to find a glove under $20 that holds up. These arrived very fast (Prime) and I put them on right out of the box. I chopped and stacked some fire wood and then did a little shoveling... and it took about two and a half hours for six of the fingers to blow out. I can normally get 10 hours out of the cheap gloves (the ones dipped in rubber). So not sure why you would buy these? They look nice, and were comfortable - hence the 3 stars."
5,COLOR YOUR WORLD,"This is obviously a system that you can take everywhere, right. But don't you want people to be surprised by how cool or colorful it is when your playing it? Now you can. With this, everyone will be looking over your shoulder when your playing saying,""Wow, where'd he get that?"" But instead of telling them, you just keep showing off."
4,evocation of kafka's prague,"this is a remarkable and uncategorizable project. photographs of prague, both vintage and by the creator of the book, and of kafka and his intimates, are accompanied by a text composed both of kafka quotes and brief and fragmentary poetic contributions by the editor/author/photographer, the whole comprising an appropriately unsettling evocation of a time, place and man. it is carefully and brilliantly sequenced, and many of the photographs are moving in themselves, as well in context: silhouette of a man rushing along a cobbled alley, vintage photographs in which the behatted pedestrians seem to float. the kafka family photographs appear to be quite precious. one can see why schocken, publisher of kafka's canon in english, felt it necessary to add this secondary work to their list. translated from the german; the earliest copyrights go back to 1925, but i would guess the book came together in its present form in 1936-7."
3,it was helpful to an extent.,the book was helpful to an extent. i used it in conjunction with other books.
5,A voice to a community of exiles,"Ana Menendez does a fantastic job expressing life as an immigrant. Through humor and uncanny examples and spanish phrases any Cuban is all too familiar with, she brings a sense of nostalgia with her words that reach and communicate not only to the Cuban people but to any group of people anywhere in the world. Fantastic read!"
1,Just go with a Sony Memory Card,"I've had this thing for a while and it has caused mostly trouble. A long time ago it deleted all of my saves, everything all at once. I tried it again and today it did the same thing. I lost Chrono Cross, FF7, FF8, FFT, and others. It all adds up to be about 300 hours. It seems too good to be true at first, but you will soon realize that it is. Buying Sony cards may take up space, but it is the only way to guarantee that you will keep your game saves."
1,Game space now available,"I purchased the 1440 from Frye Electronics. Boy was I lost. The ""Button"" does not exist...thanks you for the information in the review. That insert stated nothing about the L1 and R1 with START buttons. Thank you for the Hold all three information. I would not have thought of holding the START button and moving with the L1 or R1 button. Slow is great if it gives you more play save space."
1,A Bad Product from a Disappointing Company,"Sure It's Cheaper Than the Official Sony Cards and It Has a Little More Memory, But It Just Doesn't Seem To Work. I've Had Nothing but Problems. First It Wouldn't Save Anything, Then It Would Erase Everything, Now Its Not Even Recognized By My Playstation. Read the Rest of the Customer Reviews For This Company's Products. The Majority are Negative. Do the Smart Thing and Buy Official Sony Products That Actually Do What They Are Supposed To, Regardless of Cost."
4,Good. Not Great,"Based on the positive reviews, we went to great lengths to locate this out-of-print book. But we think it is just so-so. My daughter does not read it much. It is good, but there are better books of this style.We like the poems from ""What Your First Grader Needs to Know."""
5,Barking Spiders,"CJ has really captured the essence childhood in Barking Spiders and Other Such Stuff. The poems range from funny, sad, silly, sweet, touching, and gross (according to my daughter which, of course, is a HUGE compliment, haha). The book is, also, beautifully illustrated. While the pictures are merely black and white drawings, they evoke just as much emotion as the poems themselves. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a children's poetry book. My kids and I love it, and I know you will, too."
1,Rather disappointed!,Granted any book I started after finishing Diana Gabaldon's latest would suffer in comparison but I don't even want to finish this book. I own all of this author's other books and reread them but this one I feel is not up to par. The characters are such one dimensional caricatures: tart-tongued lassie and hardened rake. Once in a while a glimmer of the old Carlyle shines through but this book is just so formulaic and unsatisfying. There's no meat on the bones! The only reason I kept reading is because it's by Carlyle; if it had been anyone else I would have given up sooner and just thrown it away!
4,3 1/2 stars,"I read ""Two Little Lies""( a 5-star book) before this one so maybe that's half the problem. Both books are set almost simultaneously so I got a bit confused with the story lines.I LOVED Alasdair. He is the consummate romance hero. Charming, gorgeous, and disreputable. I have not laughed this hard reading a romance in a very long time. The banter between the h/h was brilliant, but something was missing.This is one of the few books I have read by Liz Carlyle that had very few love scenes. It was a very sensuous and emotional read, however, not as spicy as her usual fare.If not for the likable characters, I probably wouldn't have finished it."
2,I'm putting this book down....,"after a 100 pages or so. An alcoholic ""hero"" who goes whoring around is not real likable to me. This book is OK but I am tired of this premise. Innocent girl turns man's life around. Yeah sure."
5,Exciting and Exhilarating,"Unlike most romance novels, it has a interesting story line and surprising twist. Truly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to others."
3,Hat,"Great hat, husband loved it, when he isn't wearing it-he hangs it up in the sailboat like a picture."
5,Perfect for the Captain of your Boat!,"This was a gift for a special Friend; who loves to Fish, he loved it!"
3,DISAPPOINTED,"I wanted something different, there are a couple of different patterns, such as, the Swag and Triangle Braclet, and the Bow Tie. But, I feel I paid way too much for two different patterns that I probly would never wear. The other patterns are way too run of the mill. Small booklet, with a hefty price. The other reviews were my reason for purchasing it!"
3,Great protection but very greasy!,I love this product because it has helped to fade my brown spots on my face. The problem is that it is sooo greasy! I think it is causing me ot break out. I tend to have oily skin and my face looks like an oil slick when I use it. I am going to try out another one of their products made specifically for oily skin...
5,Fascinating History,"This is an amazing history of the Everglades and the obstacles to survival that continue in the present. Highly recommend for anyone interested in Florida, water, the environment, politics, or history."
3,Lovely as a Trinket in a Pawn Shop,"The author seems bitten by some exotic bug. The text is both florid an prosaic, like passages from the Sears catalog. Even such ordinary subjects as getting crabs or donning a frightwig seem to become somehow more ordinary under the author's heavy hand. It's as if the author is not writing poetry at all."
3,Misses the point,"More and more people identify with neither Democrat nor Republican, left nor right, blue nor red. More and more of us self-identify as moderates or independents or even ""purple"" depending on how the questions are asked. This is a funny book, but it might lead people to forget there are other alternatives politically -- like kicking them all out!"
1,Questionable seller - buyer beware!!!,"Let me say - this is the first time I have ever really had a problem with a seller on Amazon. The DVD was ordered early April, and still has not arrived. I tried three times to contact the seller to find out where my DVD was, but have not heard one peep from him/her.??I filed a claim, and Amazon made good on it by refunding my purchase. Please understand - I'd rather have the DVD than the money - that is why I purchased it in the first place. If this DVD was somehow lost in transit - that is fine...but to not have a reply from the seller..and to not have him track the package (which I was not able to do) is simply poor customer service, and shows they don't care.I will never buy from this seller again, and I caution anybody looking at anything he/she sells. Very disappointed in the lack of response!!So - buyer beware!!!A big thanks to Amazon!! They did right by the customer!!Mike"
1,this is a horrible card!!,"I recieved this card as a git a few years ago, and boy was i happy! ""Finally,"" I thought, ""more memory"". We had only recently gotten a PSX, so we didnt have many cards, 2, and they were all full. This piece of junk has crashed dozens of times! We change pages on the ""Memory Card"" screen of the PSX, but it always finds a way to crash! I reccomend a Sony, or standard 15 block card. This...thing...doesnt deserve any stars, but one is the minimum. THIS IS WHY SONY DOESNT MAKE CARDS WITH MORE THAN 15 BLOCKS!!"
1,Don't Bother with this one!!,"The InterAct (or the Pelican) just aren't worth the money, in my opinion. My kids continue to lose saved games, and, with the Pelican, it broke after only a week of use. We tried this InterAct Mega menory card--but it loses saved games as well. Bottom line: Spend the money on the SONY cards...we have two that still are perfect after nearly two years of use !!"
1,Defective. Waste of money.,"This was the first memory card i bought when i got my Playstation. I had about 14 hours worth of Sim City cities built and saved on this card, and a few other games, when it just stopped working. All the files were completely erased. When i pushed the buttons on it the numbers wouldn't even show up.I would suggest just buying the little 15 block cards."
3,"If you need to learn the basics, not so bad","If you are training with HR on the bike, it is a good book. You are better off getting a power meter and training with power.If you know nothing about bike training, then this is good. It also helps deal with the boredom of indoor riding by giving you some good workouts."
1,Can't easily make out what is being spoken,"In my opinion (and that of my family member, who is the one dealing with the pain), the voice on this is not very clear. So this purchase was a bust for us."
3,"Gets the job done, but not the best.","The bottom line with this crimper is it gets the job done. It's not the fanciest tool and it's not the most well-made tool, but it works. This crimper is not a ratcheting crimper, meaning you can release the tool any time you want. If you're not careful and you don't fully squeeze the tool to complete a crimp, you may not crimp the connector fully. Ratcheting crimpers, like thePaladin Tools 1556 All-in-One Crimper for WE/SS-Style Data & Phone Cablewill not release until the crimp is fully completed and result in better crimps.If you need to repair 4P4C or 4P2C cords, this tool will get the job done. However, if you plan on needing to crimp other cables like voice and data cables, I would highly recommend you consider a better all-in-one tool like the Paladin version:Paladin Tools 1556 All-in-One Crimper for WE/SS-Style Data & Phone Cable."
5,Read it!,"This is it.This is the book that the Frost's published in 1972 which sent a portion of the Pagan Community running back to its Christian roots! And folks portions of it are being misrepresented and skewed even today by unscrupulous publicity hounds for their own gain.Don't presume that if you've only read the blogs and blurbs that are being published on the web, you know what you're talking about.Buy it, read it, then if you choose to do so, make INFORMED commentary.Debra Ravenswood"
5,I feel like a kid again!,"I feel like it entered a time warp! I don't know how American Ringer did it, but this is exactly like my favorite shirt that I had as a kid. I just want to wear this thing all week long and use my BMX bike to jump ramps over garbage cans. I originally bought two of these for myself (one to wear and one to save) and after seeing how cool they were I ended up buying another three of them for Christmas presents. Oh and did I mention that this company included a bunch of 30 year old wax pack trading cards with my purchase? Yeah, right... I actually got unopened E.T., Star Wars, Jaws, and Grease cards... for real, I think I'm in love!"
2,"innacurate db meter, poor display visibilty.","Not sure why the other reviewer says it's accurate when I found the exact opposite results.The sound measurements are very inaccurate.. Compared to reference hardware, these are off by way more than the advertised accuracy (+/- 3.5db). I found it off my as much as +10db..Don't get this for the accuracy of the db levels.The other measurements seemed okay but to be honest I didn't test them thoroughly as I did for the db readings, which I bought this device for, on top of the main multi-meter functionality.Also the screen almost impossible to read in low light.. It would have been much more useful if it were backlit.The company will not accept returns for this device, only replacement :("
4,Good so far.,Good stuff. A little squeel but don't know if it's the rotor or the new brake shoes I put on.
3,What Some Might Consider Sophisticated,"As this is not my type of humor in reading material, I only wish to describe it. It's basically NY metropolitan area material overheard by a comic illustrator and editorial art director. The author worked for ""The Village Voice"" where these comic strips ran. Some titles of these strips are ""Friday Night at Maxwell's Plum"", ""Two Sex Scenes: Westchester and Manhattan"", Vernal Equinox at the Hayden Planetarium"", ""Thanksgiving Weekend, Port Authority"", ""Walking Tour: SoHo Art Through Anarchist Eyes"", ""Views From the Suburbs"", ""Indoor Activities at Grossinger's"", ""Symposium on Marriage at St.John the Divine"" and ""Bug Watch in Rye, New York"". I would classify the humor as ""New Yorker"" magazine style but I could be mistaken."
3,It was an ok game.,"When I went to the store, I was looking forward to getting this great add-on for my civ2. When I got home, I was totally disapointed with how the add on worked. It still was pretty good but it wasn't the ""AWESOME"" game it was advertised as. It still is worth your money but don't get all hyperventalated over it!"
4,Nice case + two complaints,"I just got this case for my shiny new macbook and it's great - soft, good quality zippers, a little stretchy for my excess cords. I do have two small complaints though.First, the main pouch for the laptop only has one zipper, which means i can't leave the zippers together on the middle top of the case. I used to do that with my old laptop case for easy access in airports.Second, the cord pouch is awesome, but I still have to take all my crap out of it to go through airport security. I'd suggest caselogic to design a pouch that can be unzipped from the main case on one edge and flopped over to the side, so the cords are not on top of the computer during the x ray.gee, do i fly too much?"
3,Fits well but smell is repulsive!,"The case fits well a 13-inch Mac, but it smells awful! if you are sensitive to smells, like rubber, i don't recommend buying it! i am disappointed...smells yucky!!"
4,Funda con bolsillo,"La funda puede ser un poco delgada (es lo normal) pero no tiene una pestaña que proteja el Laptop del cierre.mi laptop de 13,3"" cabe perfecto"
2,ninja darts,I had bought a set for my grand son who has been playing for a while. He loved them when he got them but less than a month later the tip broke on one & the flights wouldn't stay in. He was very disappointed.
1,The DVD I received is messed up!,"The soundtrack does not match the film you are seeing, and it is really irritating. (It's off by a few seconds.) I'm sure I would have enjoyed it more had it been in synch!"
5,Wonderful Book,"I still have the original paperback version of this book. The pages are yellowed and the binding is falling apart. Good story, characters you can care about and a villain scary enough to worry about"
4,Great book,"This is a great book. It is about several women all with different lives, that are linked. It has romance, drama and passion. Great, light read for all ages!"
1,An insult to the composer,"Her sound is too rough, unmusical, and just simply ugly. Let alone her iterpretation, countless notes are out of tune in some of them. I was very surprised the recording company allowed her to play through all six of them. Some patience! Horrible technique, and musicality. I am an Ysaye fanatic and own quite number of his Solo Sonata recordings and this is by far the worst one among them. I personally recommend Michael Rabin's(although only 2 of these sonatas were recorded, no.3, 4)"
3,Average book with limited appeal,Not as exciting as I would have expected a very small number of stunning photos and some average work - disappointed
5,Almond oil,I can really tell the difference in using quality oil. Almond oil makes my breads really moist and it taste much better.
4,Nice selection of songs,"I got this CD around 2000 or so. It has contemporary artists, at least they were contemporary at the time. The Backstreet Boys and NSYNC were both hot boy bands which have since fizzled. Each has a song on this disc. Toni Braxton, R. Kelly, Carlos Santana and Christina Ageulera give good performances. My favorite tracks are:Monica - Grown Up Christmas ListJars of Clay - Little Drummer BoyDave Matthews - Xmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting . .)Steps - Merry Christmas EverybodyWhitney Houston - Who Would Imagine a KingMerry Christmas Everybody by Steps is a song that just makes you want to get up and shake your money maker. I try to give this CD a spin at holiday time. It has a couple of songs I could do without, I'm really not a big Britney Spears fan. But overall a nice and fresh selection of holiday tunes."
2,it's aight,"I got this recently for some tracks&It's alright.I got to Hear R.kelly's ""World Christmas"" which is cool.Hit&Miss through out but some decent tracks."
4,It's pretty good...,"I'm listening to the cd right now. I think Britneys song is actually pretty good!( and i hate britney!)monica's ""grown up christmas list"" is ok, i think it could've had better lyrics. Joe's ""this christmas"" is AWESOME. It's got a hip beat and cool lyrics! Normally i like n*sync, but let's face it this song STINX...HARD! ANd christina... no comment. Ok so I've been listening to santanas song for about a minute now, nobodys singing... 2 minutes... alright getting sick of music,moving on to... JArs of Clay. Wow these guys have great voices!!! The song has a good tempo too! dave matthews, no comment. Dido's song sounds kind of Junkie Monkey! Won't even talk about steps. AND... NO WAY, I can't BELIEVE I'm going to say this! the bsb's song ACTUALLY sounds good. THE rest of the songs are great! R.Kelly, Donell Jones(he's not exactly the best), tlc, Toni Braxton, Whitney Houston."
5,I Like This CD,"For me this was a good overview of Parker full of nice, pleasant, easy to listen to music. This CD really hits the spot in that it shows off Charlie Parker playing nice music of various styles without going overboard on any one particular style. I'm not convinced the CD gave the full spectrum of Parker though, because the CD seems to have omitted the fast, frenetic Parker, i.e., ""hard bop."" That is a good thing in my opinion because otherwise one ends up with a CD such as Ken Burn's John Coltrane album that includes both the melodic stuff as well as the non-melodic stuff, the latter being, for me, unpleasant enough to turn off the CD player. In summary I recommend this CD."
2,"great music, horrible sound","Ken Burns and company have assembled some classic Parker takes, but the sound quality is dismal. Yes, we know these recordings were made before the advent of tape, etc.--I don't think most people interested in Parker recordings are looking for pristine studio sound, but this is a disgrace. I have many C.P. recordings, including lots of old Verve and Savoy issues on LP--none of them sound as bad as this CD. Not just surface noise, but actual musical distortion that could have been mitigated with today's technology. I was suckered into this one by the Burns affiliation, since I had enjoyed the TV jazz series. Not a fraction of the care put into that effort was expended on the CD. There is so much Parker out there today put out with more care; I would look to the Dial and Savoy sessions, for example."
2,but the sound!,"Wonderful selection of tracks, but the reviewers who commented on the sound quality are correct, it's unbearable. LOUD hissing. I have 35 year old Parker LPs that sound better. I was swayed to buy it by the many positive reviews. I was wrong, the sound guys were right."
2,Lexar TouchGuard is not there yet,"Pros: it's a USB flash drive, portable, with all of the other benefits of USB flash drives.Cons: it's a USB flash drive that costs more than others due the fingerprint reader. The fingerprint reader is lacking in accuracy. I need to swipe my finger several times in order for it to be recognized. In order to use the fingerprint reader you will need to be an ""administrator"" on EVERY computer on which you intend to use this device, which is not practical. Software is limited to Microsoft 2000 SP4 or newer operating systems, although this will not be much of an issue for Windows users. Software only supports Internet Explorer favorites. Encryption is limited to individual files.Recommendation: Pass on this one and buy a higher capacity USB flash drive for the same price, then download and use some free file encryption software such as axcrypt ( http://axcrypt.sourceforge.net/ ). Business users should look elsewhere."
2,"Finger print reader cool, but overall features pathetic","Do NOT get this gadget if you are looking for a secure/lockable portable USB storage device for files. The Lexar hype is misleading.It only encrypts individual files (not even folders) using the software package that comes with it. The device is always open (just like a regular USB thumb drive). The only thing the fingerprint reader or password does is open up the software on your PC. Once the software is open, you can unencrypt individual files or use the integrated IE password storer.Whoopee :(So in conclusion, the only thing it is good for is saving IE bookmarks and saving IE browser Web page login passwords.(and goofing around with a finger print reader)"
1,Wordy,"While I am deeply interested in the sujuect I found the author wordy. Using Old Gaelic words in an attempt to impress the reader, hopeing that they will not notice the pittifully little new information that was included in this book. This isn't the first work by this author that I've found disappointing. It isn't even the first book about the Celts and Celtic Wicca that I have been disappointing in."
4,Intresting Read,"Is basic Maths skills inherent part of us? Is it something we are born with? Or is it acquired?This books attempts to address that question and few others. In the process, we get to understand various aspects of basic mathematics learning, how toddlers to kids acquire maths skills, likely reasons for the varied skills levels of Maths found across children, adults. In the process, author takes us through variety of brain injured patients who have lost some basic skill related to mathematics which could be traced to their injury.Irrespective of whether one accepts some of the theories put forward in the book, it makes for a good read, where we get to understand the wonder of our own brain and the beauty of maths. There is more facets involved in learning maths, then a lay person may realize.This is a easy book to read. Doesn't matter whether you are good or bad at maths. Anybody with some hint of curiousity related to learning, will enjoy this."
3,The commontary was more detailed than most other Tyndale Commentaries,As a layman I need a commentary that that assists in understanding the passage I am studying. When there are many many cross references the subject matter becomes difficult to follow.
1,don't buy this,"This isn't a bad compilation--in fact, most of the hits are here, and Lady Day is as fabulous here as ever. My problem with this CD is its sound quality. The loud hisses on the first two tracks, for instance, make them absolutely unlistenable. I wonder what the recording engineer is doing there. Surely, in the age of digital technology, such obnoxious noises can be either greatly reduced or gotten rid of altogether."
4,Good Selection,"I have several Billie CD's and collections. This is one of the better ones. It chronicles her career from beginning to end and the choices are good. It also has some of her better backup musicians (ie: Lester Young, Roy Eldridge, etc.) Totally enjoyable, especially while driving in the car.."
5,Found: GreenGage Plum Jam,"This is a very difficult product to locate. When I got to your web site it was easy. The jam is great. My wife has already made ice cream with it It's her favorite jam and you got it to me very quick. I'll be back. By the way, I then found out that my mother-in-law loves it as well so I've already recieved my second order."
5,GREAT JEANS!!!,"I have been a Levi fan for years but their quality has went down hill. Thought I'd give these a try and glad I did! Just got them so I can't comment on durability however the material feels substantial enough to last. Plus these jeans are cheaper than Levi. A definite win, win! Amazon did a wonderful job as well with the order from start to finish!"
2,"Denim quality was good, sizing was too big overall","After trolling through the reviews of others regarding these jeans, I decided to order them. It's hard to find jeans locally in 44x32 (it would be much easier if I lost some weight and inches). I was satisfied with the quality of the denim and the look of the jeans. However, the fit left a lot to be desired. The waist was definitely larger than the stated 44 - may have been closer to a 46 because the jeans just fell off me. The other issue for me was the ""full leg"" (18 inches?). The wide legs made the fit feel much more like a ""baggy"" jean than a ""relaxed fit"" jean. My wife commented that they looked like ""gangsta"" jeans, and would be more appropriate on a 20 something.The return process was incredibly easy - one of the reasons that I am willing to purchase clothes online from Amazon."
5,Listen To The Quiet-Gentle Art of Nourishing Your Soul,"Absolutely enjoyable! The title reflects the content as well as anything I could say. It's perfect for self pleasure but, also makes the perfect gift. The reading is enjoyable, simple, and practical. The pictures are beautiful. It is small, so even someone that may not like to read a lot will enjoy this. Simply tie a ribbon bow around it and give it with a smile>"
5,Making Culture Pay:Solving the Puzzle of Organizational Effe,"Mr Haney has captured the essence of the importance of ""culture"" in the success of a business. Whether you are an established organization or a start-up, you need to be aware of the impact of culture on the bottom line. Written by a man that has been there! Strongly recommended."
1,Don't Bother,"The version i bought here was severely edited down even from the version that aired on cable, and since i didn't really buy it for the acting, the cinematography or the special effects, it was like buying a candy bar and only getting an empty wrapper. If there was an unrated or director's cut version of this, i would recommend that you grab that instead."
2,If it sounds too good to be true....,"I didn't notice the dimensions on the product listing (and it wasn't listed as the mini edition at that time), so I was quite surprised when this tiny book showed up. I have never used it because the recipes are so small that it just isn't user friendly. It's even so small that it tends to get lost among all of my other cookbooks. I have always enjoyed Moosewood cookbooks, and I'm sure the recipes are great, but it is just far too small to use."
3,Needs Occasional Power Reset,"It works most of the time, but about once a month freezes up. Removing and reapplying power brings it back to life, but you could waste a lot of time trying to figure out why your network isn't working if you have several components to check."
4,A Good Overview of The Hawk,"This is a nice, tasteful collection of Hawkins's music. I especially appreciated the inclusion of ""Ruby My Dear"" from the Thelonious Monk album ""Monk's Music"", which gives one the chance to hear Hawk's emotive tenor in an atypical context.The packaging is terrible though, as it is on all of the Ken Burns series. Jazz albums are supposed to have attractive cover art."
2,Broke on first use by clutzy cook,"I may be judging these too harshly, but the large oval dish broke in the sink the first time I tried to wash it. Put the small round inside the large round, and then both into the oval. Once the rounds were washed, I discovered the oval underneath was done for. Apparently the weight of putting the outer edge of the large round through the water onto the inner edge of the oval was too much for it (the large oval and large round don't nest, so they were at an angle). When I was a child, my mother severed a tendon by breaking a glass in the sink, so I practically have a phobia about being rough with dishes while washing. The other casseroles are fine, but I was disappointed with the fragility. You may have a better experience, but I'll be leery of Corning products in the future. Love those ramekins though - couldn't imagine what use they'd be, but absolutely perfect for dipping bread in garlic and olive oil."
3,"""Chip- and crack-resistant stoneware"" HA","As others have stated, the 1 1/2 quart oval dish arrived broken. Amazon sent me a replacement set which arrived with the same dish broken. The irony being the set claims to be ""Chip- and crack-resistant stoneware""... It probably used to be before it was made in China.I have used one of the dishes that survived, it worked fine.But while the packaging was insufficient and the quality was lacking, Amazon's customer servers was amazing. They are truly the most helpful customer support I have ever had the pleasure of calling."
4,Gorgeous overview of Prehistoric art in Europe.,"Paul Bahn's grand survey of prehistoric art in Europe opens a conversation with the men, and possibly the women, who made it. The art and artifacts are all carefully chosen and clearly described. The rest is up to the reader."
3,Not for Special Ed teachers,"I agree with the previous reviewer. This book, along with the others in the same series, have a lot of good information in them. However, any teachers with SE training (especially Masters degree or above) will find that they are the ""Cliff Notes"" of their graduate school textbooks. In terms of practical application, they don't have the ready to be copied tables, graphs and charts that books like ""The Tough Kid Tool Box"" have.If you haven't had that much training in Special Education, then they would be a very good resource, with a lot of concise information. EC teachers, however, will probably find them rather redundant."
2,Too simple: just for absolute beginner.,I was really disappointed by this huge book (1150 pages). The topics tackled are really too simple and even include a revision about the use of Windows 95 !!. A more consistent book would be advisable for people willing to take advantage of the real qualities of Office 97. For example in the chapters about Excel I am still looking for useful comments about the solver.
4,Great!,"The PSP is a great buy. I know, I know, it's expensive, but think about it: You can play games, go on the internet, download music and music videos, view photos, and watch movies. I think it's great to have all that in one game console. Otherwise you'd have to get a handheld gaming system for games, iPod or CD player for music/music videos, camera for viewing photos, laptop for internet, and a portable DVD player for DVDs! If you bought all the stuff I just mentioned, it adds up to more than the PSP costs. Again, though, I wish some of the stuff was a little cheaper...I don't like spending [...] dollars on a game or a movie to watch.Altogether though, great product."
5,I love my PSP,"This is actually my second psp. I happen to drop my other one and it broke.It was my own fault. It fell out my pocket and I lost the protective covering. Quite frankly I was surprised the core kit of the psp doesn't have this included. That should be a given. So that's my only complaint.Other than that its a great device. It keeps me busy while on the train, or grocery store. It is really an all encomposing media/game device.Games are a bit dark in some scenes so hopefully psp will resolve this in future upgrades and hopefully they'll make it a bit thinner. But overall its definitely worth buying.Eddy[...]"
5,Morgan gave this to Jake,"My daughter had to have this, then got tired of it and gave it to her cousin, who was completely thrilled to have it."
3,"Great System ,not alot of game selection.","well ,i owned my psp for over a year. finally got rid of it after i shelved it for 5 months. the graphics are awesome but the game selection is weak ,most games for the psp i already own on my xbox 360 or ps2. the psp is a good investment if you want your ps2 and xbox games on the go and dont own an ipod or other mp3 player. one of my biggest gripes was the battery life. fully charged it lasts around four or five hours. my advice is wait for sony to release more ORIGINAL games. hopefully sony will step it up with the psp2."
3,It's okay,"It's okay. My baby brother loves it. There were some mechanical problems with it, but it's fixed now so, it cool now. Still kind of feel like I waisted money."
4,Great System; Fun Gaming,"I bought this system and it came as it was described by the seller,(message me or comment this so I can tell you who I bought this from). I bought it used and only came with the following items: PSP 1000, PSP AC 5V Charger, 1 PSP BSttery and Output for wall charger. It didn't come with the mini USB to hook up to CPU (I already had one soo..). So far the system runs as it were new, it reads the Memory Stick Pro Duo really well. Games off the memory stick run smoothly, no lag, (i haven't checked the UMD, I assume it works, I don't have any UMD paraphernalia)... All in all it's a great system, no Microphone like the PSP 3000, but you don't mind that and the added weight (PSP 1000 is heavier than the PSP 3000), then I recommend this product to vintage gamers and new gamers alike.Thumbs UP!"
3,What They Want,"This novel is about a successful black model named Terrence Mitchell. He was single and living life with no plans at all to tie the not. Why should he get married anyways? He loved his freedom, had a steady income, no childern and mostly all the women a man could ask for. The woman loved Terrence and they did the most outrageous things to prove it to him. Then one day one of Terrence's main women wanted him to make a commitme to her. But he couldn't do that. He had women in almost every major city in the U.S. So he cut her off. AS he was sitting in his home office he all the sudden got a phone call on his cell. He noticed it was a California number so he answered assuming it was an agency offering him a job. But he was wrong, it was Michelle. He hadn't talked to her in four years. What could she possibly want? But you have to read the book to find out."
3,What THEY Want!,"I am assuming that the title is referring to what women want through the thoughts of Terrance, the 30ish main character who is a male model. This was my first Omar Tyree book (other than Cold Blooded, written under The Urban Griot) which I purchased more so for the cover than anything.I now wonder if all male models are as arrogant and conceited as Terrance and as careless about sex in these times, but not only him but some of the women (Danni, Victoria, TeShay)as well. Terrance was probably true to his thoughts as a single male and one can learn from some of his musings.I would have hoped the author would have given a little bit more insight on his and Michelle's relationship; however, I was satisfied with the ending in that it was a woman (3 years old) that will eventually help him to change his ways."
2,disappointed,These use to be my favorite. What happened to them? They don't fit correctly any more. How sad. Vanity Fair you need to go back and hire your original manufacturer. I would pay more for the vintage produced item. Your manufacturer must be laughing on his way to the bank.
1,Not the same as other websites.,"I've bought these from other websites and they fit perfectly, but when purchased here, they feel very tight. Not only that, but they are made from different ingredients than listed on both Amazon and other sites. Because of this, they feel stiff and uncomfortable. Sorry to say it, but I'll just go back to paying more to make sure I get what I'm ordering."
4,A wonderful book...,"Grab this book and settle down...you won't want to move until this book is done. The characters are unique, likeable and interesting. The plot moves along well, with just enough twists and turns to keep it exciting without being far-fetched. The story was a wonderful mixture of mystery, humour and touching moments. This is the second novel in the series, and I hope that Karen keeps them coming!"
5,Packed with Information,"Andy Covell's book, ""Digital Convergence"", is packed with information regarding the historical development and transformation of specific forms of technology. His ability to chronologically describe important technological advances and how they came to be is not only informative, but entertaining. He defines technological acronyms and allows the reader to better understand the emerging ""lingo"" that goes along with the advancement of digital convergence technology. Lastly, this book offers a well written over-view of the digital convergence phenomenon that continues to drive the evolution of technologies.I would highly recommend this book to any one who is interested in having an intelligent conversation about today's, and forthcoming, communication and technology."
4,A good bathroom book,The book was well written and somewhat humorous. The short write-ups of each disaster makes it an easy book to pick-up and put-down on a frequent basis. The events are in chronological order which makes it easy to find your favorite clamity.
4,Quality product that does the job well!,"This product works very well for it's intended purpose. I was looking for something to hold open our spring loaded hinged door from the garage into the house. This device has just the right amount of holding power, making the multiple trips with groceries that much easier. A light tug on the door handle seperates the magnet. I would have rated this 5 stars if the drywall plugs that came with the unit were a bit more heavy duty in nature. I used a screw in type plug as I was only able to mount one of the screws into a stud and didn't want to risk ripping the unit from the wall using the included plugs."
2,Much ado about nothing,"It was sticky and overscented. My sister loves it, but I felt that CD took the style over substance approach -- it wasn't terribly conditioning/softening for me, so I don't know what it is really good for."
4,The Pardo Expedition,"A good book. Well written. Easy to read.A good account of a little-known Spanish expedition through the US Southeast.Recommended for people who think de Soto was the only Spaniard to enter the interior of Dixie. You will learn something. Has several insights that help to understand just where de Soto really went and when, with excellent background on the people that he met."
2,Age Difference Makes Story Too Hard to Swallow,"Beautiful young woman of color, Katherine Churchill, falls madly in love with a very old psycho, Frank Taylor. Taylor is hiding a deadly secret from this woman who is totally blinded by her love for him, a man she barely knows, who just happens to have saved her life. The idea is just too unbelievable, for this reader. Had the male been at least 15 years younger, perhaps the idea would have been a little more convincing.Also, I felt somewhat lost because the author allowed Frank to place too much focus on a story within this story. It seemed as though he was just babbling on at times about the past.In addition, I never really understood what his true feelings for the female protagonist, were. Her feelings were well known, while his remained questionable.By the way, I had Frank figured out halfway into the book."
1,A long and boring walk,"This book was nothing more that a female basically getting what she asked for. How in the world can someone who professed to be so intelligent (Kat) the female lead in the book be so gullible. Throughout the entire book, the male lead (Jack) warned her not to read to much into their situation and to think about what she was saying and doing to him. He even told her that she didn't know him well enough to profess all of the undying love she purportedly had for him. Jack gave her all the clues in the world to the underlying of his character and she still ignored the signs to the inevitable outcome of the book. About one quarter into the book, it can be figured out what is going on between the two. The author made Kat out to be some kind of love starved, love sick, SEX STARVED, illusioned, naive, and too trusting person. Her entire dialogue consisted of ""I love you so much Jack"" and ""I want you to screw me now Jack"" This got very old after the first couple of chapters."
3,Not a great book,"This book was ok, but what I didn't really like about it was that I found that the beggining and other parts of the book seem ghostwritten. I might be wrong, but Rachel just didn't seem like herself. It just didn't seem like KAA's writing. Also, the next book, #28, had a message in the dedication that said ""thanks some person for helping her with the manuscript."" These ""thank you for helping me prepare the manuscript"" messages has been showing up since book 28. It looks like Animorphs is going to be a ghostwritten series."
5,Exelent! very suspenseful,"This book involves Aftran, the yeerk from #19, when she breaks her vow of peace and attempts to expose the animorphs. Thoroughly twisted plot with a cliff hanger ending. A must read. :~)"
3,Thin and disappointing,"Golly, but I feel like the odd man out here. Other reviewers have praised this book highly. To me it was thin in content and pretty uninformative. Maybe there's just not a lot to say about the historical Trojan War. Thus most of Strauss's narrative is a paraphrase of Homer. It is full of silly sidelines like ""An unbandaged would might have been a common sight in the Greek camp."" As my son would say: ""Duh!""I have been to Troy. I don't think that Strauss captured anything like the feeling I had on that windy headland and plain. Yes, Prof. Strauss is a good writer. Unfortunately, he doesn't have much to write about.I would recommend to prospective readers that you pass on this one. Instead, buy a copy of Lombardo's Iliad and feast in the glorious original, rather than slurping down this thin gruel."
3,Not enough AC/DC,"If you're a die-hard AC/DC fan like myslef, then definately get this video. Otherwise, I wouldn't really recommend it. There's too much other stuff in it, and the camera hardly focuses on the band. The best video has to be Let There Be Rock - definately get that one."
1,The Nadir of the Conan Series,"This books shows the latter-day Conan series at its lowest ebb, with Green writing almost on auto-pilot. I don't even think he knows what's going on in the story, and I certainly don't care."
3,"Ok, but no","ok, one of the reviews mentions that they are ""not the small ones"" i took this to mean that they werent mini, well their huge taste almost the same but they barely have any of dat sour salty stuff theyre usually covered! thats the best part, if you ask buying these is like buying skinless chicken and although you save money i wouldnt do it again.... they also melt together and form a giant mass of gummy.... i love candy so bc its cheap it get 3 stars but it deserves 1."
5,A Lesson In Love,"Reading this novel gives an insight into the true workings of love, the human spirit, and the essence of each of us...a deeper look into your soul. Deepak Chopra allows for the wonderful mixture of eastern and western beliefs to intertwine. I am an avid reader, as well as a spiritual person, and I found this book to touch upon many things people try not to see, and try much to hard to deny. I may be in the minority, but I prefer to live in my world, than theirs."
2,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to a great lesson about love, attraction and respect but surprisingly it gives lame excuses for cheating in two situations (like people haven't got enough excuses by themselves). Submissive behavior on the part of the cheated one is predominant as well. It depicts the psychiatric profession in the USA as completely disinterested in its patients improvement, which I don't know to what extent is true. Other than that, it is a good story about inspiration and being open to new ideas and approaches."
3,vibrato overkill!,"While I agree that Susan Milan has an incredible sound, her vibrato completely overshadows it. I've played many of the pieces on this CD. The French composers are great. One reviewer called her vibrato ""immense"". That is not a good thing. Her vibrato never varies. It's always the same. Variations of vibrato are a must for any flute player. Different types of music call for different types of vibrato to be used. I'm sorry to disagree with the 5 stars, but I couldn't get past that. Overall, it was really quite annoying."
4,"Great selection of music, but...","I respect Ken Burns. He's made countless compilation albums of jazz CD's, all filled with many of the artist's best songs, the problem is, they're all (or mostly)studio versions of the song. Now, this is good for easy listening jazz, but with Coltrane, one of jazzes greatest artists, you have to hear a live performance to truly understand, to truly hear the passion behind his music. This is, indeed, a great collection of Coltrane, but if you're interested in a recorded live performance, I recommend ""Afro Blue Impressions""."
4,"Makes you think, but ends poorly","I'm not usually one to judge a book by its ending. Certainly this one has its share to offer; likeable, interesting characters, a future with some original twists, an excellent feeling for what it is like to live in a community with reasonable comfort but no security. But the conclusion here is really quite a disappointment; not one but two plot developments are essentially cut-and-pasted from the story outline with no development. Piercy has done better.All in all, worth a read if you like Piercy or enjoy thinking about cyborg theory ala Haraway. Otherwise, try Slow River."
3,desiring God,"This was a very informative video that, as stated on the DVD cover, would be great for either individual study or small group/Sunday School class lesson. The speaker is very knowledgeable in Christian Hedonism and to his credit, was able to explain the concept in an understandable way. There was reference that this DVD was in response to a book also written by the speaker. While the book would have probably helped with the material, the notes and usage of the overhead in the video made the contents understandable and easy to follow. A great resource for personal christian living or group discussion"
2,Desiring More,"There is a small percentage of people I know who would enjoy this 2-DVD set on Desiring God. Piper is very educational and informational in his teaching.This 2 disk DVD set had ten sessions on what it means to truly glorify God -- finding complete joy in Him. Piper was speaking to an audience of mostly older adults in an auditorium setting. He used an overhead projector as an aid in his teaching. It seems a little old and outdated, but there are little treasures throughout these DVDs.Is this worth sharing with a class? Maybe if they are older adults who like being lectured to. I would not use this with jr/sr high. Piper shared some personal struggles from when he was in college, so college age would be the youngest I would go in using these DVDs.~disclaimer: I have not read Piper's book, *Desiring God*. My opinion might have been different had I read the book or had the DVD study guide."
1,10 years is old?,"Ok, first off, 10-15 is not old. IF it was old, then why would the proffesional hunter- jumpers be using horses in that age range? I have an 11 year old ex racehorse, who still thinks he's 4. My horse is still going strong and is learning a lot. If he is so old and decrepi, then why would he still be so rambunctious, even if I ride him for an hour and a half 6 out of the 7 days a week? So to all of you who have a horse this age, don't buy this book because your horse isn't old!(Unless it has injuries that make it seem old)"
3,"Great, if you can ever get it put together, that is!","This is a great swingset, but the assembly and directions were the worst I have ever seen. It took FOREVER to assemble, and getting parts to fit correctly was a task I never want to tackle again. We were also missing several of the bolts from the box, and a slide stair was also missing. WE had to go back to get a slide stair, and had to purchase the bolts to assemble a few things. A nightmare, but it's awesome if you can ever get the stinking thing put together. Dont expect to get it up in time for your kids to play on it the first day, or the second either, took us three days to finally get it all the way it's supposed to be."
4,Great Swing set/ Instructions awful,"My kids love this swing set! (ages 5 and 3) The top bar is higher than some sets so the swings go higher, which my kids love. There is also a nice variety of swings and bars to keep them entertained. The dark color of seats and slide isn't great for hot climates b/c they retain heat. The instructions are horrible, therefore it takes longer than necessary to assemble. It is VERY long so make sure you measure your space before you start to assemble it."
4,The sixth DVD of the Tenchi In Tokyo series.,"Ryoko, hurt and feeling betrayed, returns to a life of crime, while Kiyone and Mihoshi are promoted to Headquarters. Washu has become so obsessed with her research that she even ignores Ayeka and the rest of the household, what's left of it.Yugi and her minions are winning. The family is breaking apart and as each person leaves Yugi becomes more and more delighted.Even Sasami and Ryo-Ohki break away, feeling Ayeka has gone insane.Soon Yugi will win...but what does that mean? What will happen when she wins? And has Tenchi become too involved with Sakuya to care?"
2,Not what I expected,"This is a dark roast, which is not stated anywhere on the product. It's almost a burnt taste, like some of Starbucks' coffees. Even with that, which was not expected since it is not listed as being a dark roast, the beans were stale when they arrived. A disappointment, for sure."
2,"GOOD SKYPE PHONE, BAD LANDLINE PHONE","I bought this product to make SKYPE phone calls. It sure does its job well with SKYPE. However, using the phone for just a regular landline phone call has been unsuccessful. It turns out that the quality of the sound is garbled and unclear even when the volume is turned all the way up. I believe it is a defect and GE should address this problem. If you are using this product for SKYPE primarily, it is a good buy. Definitely not for the regular landline use."
4,I Finally have the Bonus Mic!,"For at least 6 years, whenever my brother and his goofy friend landed on a Bonus Mic space, they would say ""Let's play the Bonus Mic"" and give ME a creepy stare. Now that I have this handy bonus mic, there is no more of an excuse for that. I have found a few mic minigames that are very fun thanks to this device."
2,oK...,"Well this thing isnt tht great because you have to buy more targets if you dont have a copyer and when you shoot the target and the bbs go in the bb traper thing it gets big and small pieces of paper in there all over and you have to pick out you bbs without getting the paper, go buy a sticky taret, you shoot it they stick then fall to a trap."
4,Insight into an unfamiliar culture,"A good read...the author reminds readers throughout the book that observations written about the Amish community in which she grew up are hers alone; that not all families live as she did, and her views are not necessarily reflective of all Amish communities. Her story gives readers a peek into the Amish community and answers some of the questions of ""why"" they live as they do. It also brings other questions to mind that are not answered such as why it is common for children and women to be treated unfairly or badly by persons who claim to follow God's teachings. Overall, interesting if you like human interest non-fiction."
4,Born Amish,It was so enlighting. It really was interesting to me to actually read about the Amish communitity.
1,Disappointing,"I picked us this book because I heard that Senator Kerrey was a presidential hopeful for the Democrats. Turns out that is Senator John Kerry from Mass, not Bob Kerrey from Nebraska. Regardless of the political future of the author, this book was a disappointment. Senator Kerry tells two stories, the first of his uncle who was killed in WWII. Second, his own story of growing up in Nebraska, joining the service, going to Viet Nam, being wounded and recovering. However, there is no analysis of the events past the obvious ""Viet Nam was a mistake"" and we were not fighting to win. He also stops and at the point where he gets out of the VA hospital and does not tell us how he went on to become a US Senator. I would not recommend this book."
4,Handeling Life's Problems,"First conceived in 2000, in his book, Shattered Dreams, Dr. Larry Crabb examines common hopes (dreams) going deeper than health, employment, finances and relationships. Not everything desired materializes and when life encounters an unexpected hitch a shattered dream does not have to mean the end. An encouraging ""How to handle life's normal problems"" is addressed in a unique spiritual way. An added bonus is the included 114 page workbook covering an eight week opportunity of concentrated study keyed to the text of Shattered Dreams. I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review"""
1,Just 'cause it's ANGEL doesn't make it good.,"Despite my high hopes for this book, I was very disappointed in the actual reading of it. I'm a big ANGEL and BUFFY fan, and I've read most of the novels; some of them have been pretty shoddy, but this one takes the cake. The writing is awful and completely disjointed; Angel's flashbacks are thrown in like a very badly placed afterthought, and Holder obviously wasn't able to spend enough time with this book. It's easily one of the worst novels I've ever read, in any genre, and puts the actual ""City Of"" episode to shame."
5,Great Collection,"It would be impossible to have all of the great hits of Count Basie on 1 CD, but this collection is great nonetheless. It is a great introduction to a man who spanned many decades playing fabulous music. His sound was one of a kind. For those who know him I'm preaching to the choir; for those that do not, take a listen and then you'll want more."
2,The cork is not thick enough by the mouthpiece.,The color is cool but the cork by the mouthpiece is not thick enough and it wiggles. I would like to exchange it for one made properly but there wasn't any paperwork shipped with it. I wish I would have bought it somewhere else.
3,Cute concept but the book hasn't held up well,"Its a very cute idea, lettting the child participate in the race, make choices along the way, but my son was not rough with this book and several pull tabs broke pretty quickly."
3,"Good ideas, but not written in a pleasing, accessible style","This book expresses several intriuging ideas about anger. It can be very helpful for those who are already willing and able to decipher ""psychology-speak."" The successful reader will also be able to take some rather esoteric ideas and relate them to their own life situation.I find the book's organization to be weak (and kind of weird), and the pseudo-examples to be meandering (and kind of weird). These guys clearly have useful - potentially life transforming - information to share. It would be nice if they could get out of their own collective way and just say it!"
5,"a fantastic, challenging book","this is an eye-opening book. I'm a therapist and highly recommend it to anyone interested in grappling with one's own(or others') anger. I found some of the writing perhaps needlessly dense, but much of it was compact and eloquent. The letter-writing format, in my view, worked; it was a novel approach to a subject that's been rendered dry and dull in more conventional structural formats. In a word, this is just a flat-out, great book--a profound, startling meditation on anger."
2,not what I expected,"I think I made same mistake again... you loved the sound tracks in the original movies.Then looking for the musics pieces so you can play.But again, sound track normally played by various music instruments and effects.This book is simple to play but not enjoyable...Next time I will stay with sound track MP3..."
2,WARNING! Not exactly for 3 bikes...,"Well, we bought this two months ago for our three bikes. My nice, light, Schwinn 26"" (about <30 lbs), an old-school ladies 24"" 10-speed (<30 lbs), and my son's new Aviso Blade 26"" bike (30 lbs). This rack worked well when it was being used for just my bike and my son's. But once we added my fiance's bike to the mix, the right upright tube buckled. This proses a serious problem because with the tube now leaning away from the assembly, the small, silver bracket used to keep the trunk-mount part of the rack perpendicular to the rest of the rack, pops out. This allows the assembly to shift and almost collapse off the car; not a good thing.So, before I totally trash this product, I'll just say that as long as at least one bike is a child's bike, it ""can"" carry three bikes. If you're looking to carry three adult bikes, you may want to look elsewhere.By the way, the manufacturer says that the load limit on this rack is 100 Lbs. Take that for what it's worth."
4,So far a good product...,"I really wanted to buy the 4 bike rack however the cost difference, $100 vs. $40 made it an easy decision in my opinion and here's why... I am not sure if this is the product that I really want and I wasn't sure how well it would work with my vehicles (2012 Honda Odyssey, 2010 Chevy Malibu), so for $40 vs. $100 I thought I'd give it a try. So far I have only put the bike rack on the trunk of the Chevy Malibu and it was very easy. It only took me 8 min from the time I took it out of the box and had it fully functional and ready to put the bikes on, I know because of the time on the pics I took to add to this review. I imagine putting the bikes on will take a little longer if I don't want to damage the car. I am a bit concerned if the product will fit or not on the Odyssey but even if it doesn't, for $40, I have something that works with the other car. Once I have the bikes on and try it on Odyssey I'll try to update this review and maybe give it a 5* rating."
1,"magic it is not, that i can assure you",this movie is the worst movie i have ever seen. What ever you do do not buy this. anything is better than this. Waste your money on something else like sandals or something.
2,"Hasn't shipped yet, and it's been a week!",Not please so far. They haven't even shipped yet. If you need this anytime this month don't order from these guys. Gave it two stars because it still might be good quality this review is solely of the shipper
5,Will not buy any other sheets from now on!,"After reading all the amazing reviews I had to give these a shot and I was not disappointed in the least! Right out of the bag I could tell that these were going to be very comfortable. After a quick de-wrinkling in the dryer they were good to go. They are nice and thick and the soft feel of the sheets is incredible. The thickness does not make them heavy, but luxurious. I've ordered extra sets and have given all my other sheets to Goodwill - I won't need them since I've found these! The only word of caution I would give is that the colors in the pictures are not very accurate. I have Chamois and Sage. The Chamois is a nice tan color and the Sage could be described as mint. I'd say this is a small trade off for some truly comfy sheets!"
5,Would buy these again in a heartbeat,"4 weeks post-purchase, still loving these. It's harder to kick the 7 y/o out of the bed now, though <LOL>. Truly, the best sheets we've ever had."
2,Shrinks After First Laundry Cycle,"First off - love, love the fabric finish. Very soft! After unpacking the sheets, I washed them (like I always do for purchased fabric items). I used the warm permanent press wash cycle, and low 40 minute dry cycle for my king sized sheet set. They did not pill. However, the set was noticeably smaller after removing them from the dryer. I have a pillow top mattress and the sheet set barely fit after the first washing. The pillow cases were a major struggle to put on my standard king pillows. I do like the feel of the sheets, but they should be either pre-shrunk, or made slightly larger than a king sized mattress to earn a ""luxury"" label."
5,Perfect,These sheets came highly recommended to me by friends. They were a christmas present for family and they told me they love them.
3,Cream color is all wrong,"Ordered the cream and was expecting an off white color, like the picture. They were just too yellow. I couldn't make them work with my bedding and furniture colors. Contemplated ordering the white but was afraid it would be too stark. Sadly returned them before trying."
2,I'm leaving a trail!,"I'm pretty dissapointed with this purchase. I washed these prior to their first use and the first night we slept on them they left droppings everywhere. (Including on us, hence the trail when walking away from the bed.) After two additional washings and I guess 20 or so nights on the bed they're still doing it. At this rate they're going to worn slap through before too long!"
5,Fabulous luxury!,I've never felt flannel sheets that are so luxurious and comfortable! They wash up like a dream! Worth every penny!!!
4,great sheets,"We've had these sheets for about a month now and they are so soft and cozy! We love them. They do pill a bit, but nothing a good washing doesn't fix then they are soft as the day we bought them. Highly recommend these sheets!"
3,Too much lint,"The sheets were wonderfully soft at first, but after washing them four times, they are still filling up my dryer screen with handfuls of fluff. They are still nice,but not as soft as they were at first."
4,deep pocket,"I read almost every review on these sheets prior to purchase. My main concern was how deep the pockets were. Our mattress is 17"" thick and I wanted to be sure the sheets I ordered would be able to fit on our mattress. I finally decided, after much research, to order the Pinzon 190-Gram Velvet Flannel sheets. They washed very nicely and yes, you do need to clean the lint trap on your dryer a few times the first time you dry them. They fit the mattress and felt wonderful. The only reason why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because I noticed they shrunk a bit on the 2nd washing and fit the mattress a little tighter. I'm washing them as per the directions and drying on low heat. Since they were reasonably priced, I will be happy if I'm able to use them for the rest of the season."
5,Very nice,"Great sheets for wintertime use.Highly recommended, been using for 3 months and no issues.The only slight downside is that the colors look a little different in person than online."
5,I love these sheets,"I purchased these sheets due to the great reviews. ""Here is another one"". I love them and will be purchasing more. They are extremely thick and amazingly soft. I am very picky about flannel sheets because they have a tendency to pill and not be soft enough. These are worth every penny."
3,fairly heavy,This is a nice sheet set...heavy weight. Holding up well to lots of washing. I don't have any problems with them
5,Absolutely love these sheets!,We love flannel sheets and use them exclusively all year round. These are now our favorites. They are soft and velvety and wash beautifully with no pilling. We have put in an advance order for two more sets to arrive in October.
5,Excellent sheets,"I was not impressed with the Pinzon towels but took a chance on these Pinzon sheets, and I am so glad I did. These are incredibly soft and comfortable sheets. Although the sheets do leave quite a lot of lint on the dryer trap, I haven't had any problems with lint balls or cotton fluff falling off into the room when we use the sheets.The sheets have also remained soft throughout multiple washes, and it is very, very hard to get out of bed on a winter morning.The only (minor) complaint I have is that I purchased a set of the blue sheets (nightshadow? I can't remember the exact name as it is not listed on the amazon site right now) and a few months later, ordered the charcoal color. It turns out that the two colors look too much like each other, unlike what I saw on the website, so I ended up with two sets of almost identical sheets."
3,"A rose, by any other name...","Having read PROVENANCE OF SHADOWS, I think that I had a better idea of what to expect going into THE FIRE AND THE ROSE. I have two problems with this book. First, it didn't seem related to PROVENANCE. It may have been similar in tone, in purpose, but it didn't seem to touch on any of the plot points that PROVENANCE brought up.Worse, though, is that it didn't feel original to me. Where PROVENANCE offered us a look at McCoy in a manner we hadn't really seen before, FIRE was basically a retread of J.M. Dillard's THE LOST YEARS and STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE. Throughout the book I had a pervasive feeling of having already seen it before.PROVENANCE gave us a look at McCoy in two situations, really exploring the character's history and self in a way that hadn't been done before (to my knowledge). THE FIRE AND THE ROSE, by contrast, merely offers the same analysis as before, with the same result, and suffers for it."
5,Excellant,"A very good depiction of the inner struggles that Spock must deal with in his life as he trys to balance his human and Vulcan sides. It shows how one who can want something and then attain it, only to find that it's not really want he wants. A must read for all Spock fans out there."
3,Music played well but for diehard Nielsen fans,"The prior reviewer offered a good description of the selections. However, although everything was played well, this is a case where these musicians' talents could have been put to more subsatantial and higher quality repertoire. Especially the recording of the Piano Trio -- a juvenile work which any composer would be embarassed to have recorded for mass distribution!If you are a Nielsen completist looking for the quintet plus some obscure works, then this is the CD for you. Otherwise, a pass (though I gave it three stars for the performance, packaging and liner notes -- all very good)."
3,Meh. . . . It's ok.,"I loved some of this book, and really didn't get other areas. The prose is delightful and definitely does conjure up images of wilderness and enchantment, as other reviewers have said. But as far as any practical application of these practices, I felt this book fell short. I read it quite a while ago, and can't think of one thing I actually used it for beyond ther original reading! Maybe its my own preferences- but this book didn't do a whole lot for me."
3,"Pleasant, Typical BTB","A pleasant read, typical Barbara Taylor Bradford...usual great clothing, sites, descriptions of Paris (loved that, felt like I got to know the city more), and the plot is predictable. BUT, a good beach read, which is all I wanted from this."
1,contrived and predictable,"I have never read one of Bradford's books before but this one called to me from the shelves. It was a story I was eager to read. By the time I was into chapter 4, I was embarrassed to tell people I had purchased it. The conversations sounded like horrible soap operas: pathetic and overly-detailed compliments. The reason for the characters' fight was weak and all actions were pre-determined. I wouldn't read any more of her books. Don't even think about this book."
1,Utterly Boring,Please do not waste time on reading this one. My first on Barbara and if her rest of her works are anything like this one then I will stay a long way from it. I allowed one star coz there was no option for nil.
1,Embarrassing,"I checked this out at the library to listen to in the car on a long road trip - it was an unabridged version. About 30 minutes into it I was thinking that an abridged version would have been better. This is a story about self-absorbed women who are talented, but still need men to ""rescue"" them. It ends happily-ever-after with handsome men and gifts of jewelry. I particularly hated the part about the woman with the weight issue. It did pass the time on the road and saved me from bad music."
2,Transmittion Problems,"Shortly after purchasing both radios developed a 2-3 delay between pushing the transmit button and the radio actually transmitting. Obviously anything said during that time period is lost. Could live with that except when utilizing the VOX capability. Pretty hard to remember to talk for 2-3 seconds before saying anything meaningful. Returned radios in exchange for new ones, will see if these are any better. Cobra was of NO help, dropping my calls twice while waiting for technical assistance."
4,Handy and easy to use,"Purchased these before a grueling day long hike in Paradise CA. Worked well in steep terrain. Used them on the day long drive, car to car. Perfect pick when heading to an area with no cell reception."
1,wrong darts,"i ordered darts with more grip area than i got. the picture showed exactly what i wanted, but when i got them, they were not the same grips."
4,Escapist fun,"This film is exactly what you would expect from the Japanese action-comedy genre. Everything about this movie is over-the-top, such as the blood and gore, the acting, and the physics-defying action scenes. However, that same over-the-topness is what makes the movie so fun to watch. If you take the movie seriously, you're watching it wrong.There's only one real extra (some mini episodes connected to the film universe), but good film and sound quality. The sub-titles were fine - readable, but not intrusive. Recommended for people looking for a fun, weird movie on a Saturday night. ^_^"
5,awesome product!!!,Thanks so much for this cd! It was delivered on time. I gave it to my boyfriend for Christmas and he loved it! Thanks!
5,Very excellent,"Unlike most hot sauces Matouk's West Indian has a papaya base. (Oddly enough it does not taste at all like papaya.) This makes the sauce much less acidic, and less vinegary. However, the sauce still packs a punch of hotness. This sauce is excellent on quiche, scrambled eggs, baked chicken, rice, fish, pork, hamburgers, or steak. I also use it in chili; it gives the chili a nice heat and flavor without adding the acidic hot pepper taste. We have been using this sauce in our house for over three decades and would be hard pressed to replace it with another. If you are looking for a hot sauce that is hot, unique and has multiple uses Matouk's will do the trick."
5,Great for all hair types.,I'm so over joyed with this purchases works on my hair as well as weaves great price fast shipping love his buy.
1,how do you use this item?,I have not been able to figure out how to use this item. They are too long and bulky. They are useless.
4,Very tight cd,"Now I'm from San Francisco, but I just recently heard about this rapper named Andre Nickatina(formerly known as Dre Dog). But then I got this cd and it's tight! He got some good skills, but I heard his older stuff is better so I'll have to check that stuff out too. My favorite song on this cd is the title track These R The Tales. This song is so funny(It's basically the same concept as Too $hort's classic song Freaky Tales, except this one is funnier). The other tight songs on here are Cherybananapumpkinpie, Gang Bang Heaven, The Ave. Remix, Glorified, One Ticket Please, and Saw A Gangsta Cry. !Ice Cream!!! is a pretty good instrumental to freestyle to, but it's a little too short and the beat can get annoying after a while. Candy Rain would have been a really tight song if it wasn't less than 2 minutes long. But overall this is a good cd to have to your collection, so check it out!"
4,a marvelous and most stimulating book,I was particularly fascinated by the lengthy account of tai chi (and its precursors) history. I thought the book was complete in its execution and very readable.
2,these slippers do not run true to size-be careful,i had to return these slippers because they were much too small. but amazon was great about the return. I have worn the daniel green glamour slipper in he past and just received a new pair of the glamour slippers and they fit much better.
3,Thinly made,"I have been a Daniel Green customer for years. However this particular style is not high quality as what I used to buy.I ordered half size larger because it does run small. As for the width, it could be a little looser. I am a normal medium and do not have much of an arch so for those with big arches, I do not recommend this slipper. Also the sole is man made just like another reviewer said. The only leather part is the top and I wonder how long this will last. When I slipped my foot, my toe was pushing through the leather. That tells me this is thin and poorly made. My old ones never showed that. Of course my previous style was more of a mule(Glamour, kidskin) style and the the front had more space, slightly square in the front. I gave three stars because the quality is not great and is not all leather like it is stated in the description."
3,A useful supplement for learning Nepali,"I put this tape in my car stereo and listened to it about 100 times before my trip. When I got to Nepal I found that I had developed an ""ear"" for the sound of the language (a Nepali native speaker reads the words)but was pretty weak in vocabualry and grammar. As advertised, the phrases are oriented towards trekking-- hiring porters, asking directions, buying supplies, things like that-- so it's not quite the same vocabulary you need for social chit chat. However, in conjuntction with the vocabulary and grammar in the back of ""Nepal Handbook"" by Kerry Moran, I had a good foundation for very basic converstaions. Learning a little Nepali truly enhanced my trip since it made me stand out from the thousands of other tourists. I was glad I had taken the time to listen to this tape since it definitely helped me be able to pick up vocabulary faster once I was in Nepal, however, it's not quite sufficient to stand alone as the only source for learning the language."
2,falsely advertised,"This out-of-print book is advertised as ""Language Tape and Phrase Book"". When it arrived from a used book seller there was ONLY THE PHRASE BOOK, which is next to useless WITHOUT THE TAPES that allow you to hear the correct pronunciation. I immediately returned the book to the seller. Hopefully my next credit card will show the refund. The phrase book itself is OK, but it's dishonest to advertise it as coming with the language tapes when it does not."
3,Lot's of Photos,It was an interesting read with lot's of pictures. More like a pictoral type of book.
5,Wonderful Outfit Scrapbook,"This is a great photo-history of the Chicago Mob, from Colosimo from the present. The history of the nation's most successful and interesting crime family is laid out concisely and clearly by Outfit expert John Binder. The photos alone are worth the price of the book."
4,Good value,Good value and pretty instrument. Have had a little valve sticking but other than that it is fine.
2,Not good value for money,disappointing 2006 publicationThese are very standard type Dashboards not up to date and the book needs revising for latest MS product
5,Invaluable!,"The UFO Handbook is a great ""how-to"" guide for the UFO investigator, listing tools, techniques, and procedures of enquiry.The first third of the book covers IFO's (Identified Flying Objects), with a multitude of photographs and diagrams that clearly explain how normal, everyday objects can be misinterpretted as something they're not.The remainder of the book, entitled the Tools Section, covers various techniques that can be employed by the UFO investigator. Everything from animal reactions to radar, hypnosis to lie detectors is explained in full detail.This is the one book that any serious investigator of UFO's should not be without. I found it fascinating reading and a great addition to my UFO library."
4,"Wake Up, America!","After reading Ms. Alexander's book, I was surprised to find out the different ways I perceived people in the porno industry vs. those not involved. I really was biased and had no concept of why people were even involved in this industry. Not only is this book informative, I found it easy to read and not something I wanted to put down without a fight. I read the entire book in three days! Thanks for enlightening this reader!"
4,4.5 stars,I like this one better than the first album. The vibe is great. Very relaxed tempo. The production is top notch. Excellent use of live instruments. I'd love to see this band live.
1,Physics: Principles And Problems (Paperback),"The book is not worth the money, also the book I received is old. I am not sure if they send me a wrong one or not. I returned the book."
4,The start of something beautiful,"There's little to be said of the Hap and Leonard novels other than they are immensely entertaining, witty, and fast paced. Lansdale's voice is at times hilarious, and at times poignant. There are real souls to these characters, and you really care about them.In this first installment, Hap and Leonard find themselves in the middle of a treasure hunt gone awry. It's a very short novel that can be read in a day if you've got the time. Plot-wise, it's not as good as Rumble Tumble or Mucho Mojo or the others, but it relies heavily on character development, and that is always a good thing.Like Elmore Leonard, Lansdale's cast of characters are bizzare to the nth degree, yet despite their zaniness, he manages to make them human. This has got to be my favorite Buddy series. Always gets me laughing."
4,Fun Read,"Good book. Reading the rest of the series now, but my library didn't have this book. Lots of things happen, and then people do things, and I'm trying to add 20 words to this review."
5,finally a guppy food for guppies!!!!,"i have tried various guppy foods, but thought it was for larger fresh water fish and just by putting a name on the package doesn't make it so. this food comes just as advertised. a nice food the proper size for the fish. it is made up of ingrediants that causes good health and color. if your looking for guppy food, stop and buy this product. as usual amazon got it to me quickly and it arrived on time"
3,"Not Bad, Not Great","Though ""Farther Than Any Man ...."" provides an inventoried account of Cook's voyages, I can't help feeling disappointed with this book. Too much verbiage is focused upon Cook's habitual characteristics (how many times must we be reminded that Cook harbored a desire for greatness despite his status in a class-based society?); as a result, the reader never gains a connection to or appreciation of Cook's travles (especially the wonderful and diverse worlds Cook explored).In the end this book felt more like a work of hero worship than a thorough account of Cook's life and accomplishments."
1,Will NOT work in WIN XP,"PCI cards identified as Nm9705, Nm9735 & Nm9745, marked on the card itself, have older chip sets that will NOT ""respond to any attempted use of the Port"", even tho ""the Drivers may appear to install properly and no errors or warnings are generated"". This from a 'ReadMe1st' file downloaded with a driver set when the drivers on the disk included with the PCI card would not work. Above PCI cards have been replaced with a newer series, Nm9805, Nm9835 & Nm9845.Amazon.com has been very responsive in issuing a pre-paid return label and I appreciate the suburb service that I have received over the years."
4,a must for mechanical engineers,This book is one of the basic books every mechanical engineer has to have in his library. It covers everything starting from the very basics. There is also the second volume which covers advanced topics and completes this one.
2,Safety sacrificed for convenience,"I picked up this very convenient, already assembled trike as a secondary bike to take to grandmas. The folded size fits perfectly in the trunk or the bad seat of any car. However, this trike is not built right. On his first try he tipped over. On his third try he tipped over again. I was able to catch him on the fourth try but he was on his way to tipping again. My child's safety comes first before anything else. This thing is going back to the store. Parents- let your kid try before you buy. This product is dangerous!"
1,Very Unstable !!!,"This trike in useless! Our 2yr. old tips over every time she tries to ride it. Buy something that's worth the money and safer!Now our daughter won't go near the thing, or any other trike!I expected much better from Radio Flyer!"
5,Super cute and my 16 month old daughter loves it!,This is a super cute trike for beginners and on... Made by Radio Flyer which has been around forever and is great quality! My husband and I found it at ToysRUs and our 16 month old little girl sat right on it as if she had riden it a hundred times! Pink and Purple and really girly yet durable and well- made! We got it for her for Christmas and she just adores it!!! Great price too. Check it out in the store and see if your little one loves it as much as ours! Enjoy! :)
5,love it!!,"Very durable,folds up easily to go in the car or for storage (when they grow out of it)my daughter is 22 months old and she just loves her bike!!"
4,True detective,Enjoyed the read. The historical characters and era gave the reader a realistic backdrop to tell the story. Didn't see the ending coming.
3,"Use older tecnologies (ANT, not ANT+)","I bought some suunto stuffs to connect it with ANT+ devices, but they didn`t because suunto use ANT, a older tecnology in my pont. It looks good and work well with suunto M5, but now a day some app phones help you to have good informations about your exercises. And these can show your speed and record it. Try a Wahoo speed an cadence bluetooth."
4,Pimsleur Plus - Only One Minus,"This was my only encounter with the Pimsleur method, and on the whole I found it easy to use. The introduction of new vocabulary was, as promised, skillful and repetitions were well timed. The main minus for me was I had hoped it would be more advanced.Still, there are always subtleties to even the simpler phrases in learning a language, and the tapes helped me to consolidate and clarify my understanding. I was a bit annoyed, though, to find long pauses (for your answers) even at points where the material was quite elementary, since these lessons were described as being at least at an intermediate level."
2,defective disks,"the second disk has a number of unviewable episodes, i have ordered the same item from other suppliers, and it seems it is a common problem. other suppliers disks had the same problems, so i didn't bother returning it."
2,interesting pieces but dull performance,"The works are interesting and little-played, unfortunately Järvi conducts this music as if it was an adagietto by Bruckner, so that it even becomes boring ! If someone knows a russian version (like Mravinsky or Rojdensvensky), ieven with a worse recording, it's worth getting the real intense flavour of this music."
3,Good but nothing new,"I've been following Metheny for almost 25 years now. I've seen him in concert 10 times, own all the group and solo CD's as well as most of the sideman stuff. I always look forward to new releases because he normally doesn't repeat the past. Somehow with each new release he manages to break new ground. Until now. With ""Speaking Of Now"" I couldn't help but feel that I've heard all of this before. The same synth patches, the same wordless vocals etc. Even the compositions themselves sound familiar. ""Imaginary Day"" was so fresh and alive it would be hard to top it but ""Speaking of Now"" is a real letdown.If you've never heard the Metheny Group before this isn't a bad place to start because it is a good CD (you're much better off with ""Imaginary Day"" though) but if you're an objective, long time fan, this one will be pretty low on your list of Metheny Group favorites."
2,one word: cheese,"i probably own 20 metheny albumns and am in complete awe of his playing and writing talents. im very dissapointed by this albumn. ive given it at least ten listens and it doesnt get any better. most of the songs lack soul, plain and simple. they are formulaic; you can predict the modulations, when the gtr-synth will be hauled out, when lyle will rehash the lead melody with his tired flutey sound,oh and....look out, here comes that closing crescendo thingy again whipping us into a shopping mall frenzy!i dont mean to be so negative but here is one of the best musicians alive and he's offering us the soundtrack to the next brady bunch movie?"
2,Very disappointed: nothing new here,"I would have given ""Speaking of Now"" a '1', but some people may be new to Pat Metheny. He's too good to ever deserve the lowest score.This release is painfully uncreative. Each of the songs could safely be camouflaged on any one of his previous works with the Metheny Group.If you don't have them yet, try ""First Circle"" or ""Still Life (Talking)""."
2,Speaking of the Past,"The good news: Not many artist have staying power, possess the ability to challenge and reinvent themselves artistically. While at the same time, remain true to their calling. After all, they are not machines.Now the bad news: There is nothing new here, it's not an exciting transformed sound. Additionally, to my ears, the new personnel sound mostly the same as the previous personnel. It's a somewhat predictable recording.Being a fan of PMG, as a group or individually, I'm disappointed in this latest effort.Some fans here have articulated this much, so I will not speak to that. Musically, these artists show their years of honing and mastering their skills. But this new recording has nothing that would show a new musical direction. Actually, I've heard better in their previous recordings.I will be at their concert in March. It is there were I hope to see PMG along with the new personnel stretch out and fulfill the anticipated promise."
3,Try to listen to it a little longer.........maybe,"I waited for this Cd to come out and I am sorry was greatlydisappointed,with the loss of Paul Wertico,it does not have those ""smooth grooves"" as there has been in is previous albums.I really tried to listen to the ""new "" drummer,its weak.The only thing really keeping this band together,in motionis Steve Rodby,with his bass parts being the ""mover"".As othershave written....it really sounds like the rest.Its good for thecollection............."
5,Great for custom installs in your Tacoma,"I got this to help me install a new head unit in my Tacoma. This is basically a plug that fits another plug hidden in your dash.Head-Units (stereos) have a bunch of wires that need to be wired into your truck. You can either cut that custom plug out of your truck and hardwire something there, or you can wire this adapter and make it plug and play.Just get some wiring caps, do some color matching, boom boom boom, within 20 minutes you saved yourself about $500 or so on labor costs installing your unit. Maybe less savings, but it's STILL a savings of $$$.Be sure to get a Scosche cradle to replace the custom Toyota crap. They sell single and double-DIN units, matching either the grey or black in your baby.It's not that hard to do if you read up, don't be afraid, this stuff is easy."
5,Leather coat,Looks great on. Well made should last for years. Great fit and warm. Will recomend this coat to all my friends.
5,"One tip, Don't read it before going to bed!","This is the only book that ever scared me out of my wits yet made me teary-eyed. As a suggestion from a librarian, I borrowed the book and I loved it. I Like the end. That's the part that almost made me cry because it hit too close to home. Borrow this book from the library first, though. Liking it is a matter of taste."
1,Don't know because it's not here.,"I ordered this item during a Friday sale on February 23, 2007. They delayed my order until April 20, 2007.Now they are telling me it won't be in until late August?!?!?!?Order if you don't need it right away......"
5,Inspiring!,"Just wonderful - I thoroughly enjoyed this book, & will continue to look to it for inspiration!"
5,Lovin Flave,"flavor flave is odd looking,but the way he thinks he's fine is hilarious. And the experience with ''Public Enemie'' the band. I just think he's use to that. And because he's use to that,he just loves the atenttion. I think that's why the show is hilarious,i love it. I totally desirves 5 stars!!!!!!"
4,better than what public Enemy has done in years,"i give Flav props on a show that is funny. it's as funny as Public Enemy was back in the day with there Abbott&Costello Routines that chuck D&Flavor flav would do playing off one another(all them so-Called Conscious acts are Buffoons at the end of the day for the highest bidder anyway) i give Flavor Flav Props for also not being a ""Never Was"" in a Backing Band on the VH1 Honors&also not allowing himself to being seen as a ""Has-Been"" on such a show either. He did it the right way in Reality Tv&Will be alright in the bigger picture. the rest of Public Enemy should take heed&get on there own Reality show. flavor flav had the right idea at the right time&also is hooking up with some fly babes."
4,Well almost uncensored,Ok for those that asked this DVD is basically uncensored.You will get to hear all the F bombs ect.You will get to see Serious (The Model) and Smiley (The crying stripper) topless (those 2 are worth the price of the DVD alone).Smiley is topless at least twice. Smiley steals the show at the 5 senses competition. She strips to a G-string unedited.You will see New York in her see through nighties and one rear nude in Mexico.The reason why I did not give it 5 stars is because the shower scene with Pumkin Hoops and Flava is STILL full censored!! BOO!!!The scene was one of the hottest in the show and they blurred it!There are other scenes where girls are also censored with little blurs in the right places. I guess some girls signed a release for this DVD to show them nude and some didn't.There are many extra scenes too.If you liked the show this is a must have.
1,plot-less!,"alright, Animorphs is usually fun and interesting to read, but this was oh so boring. Is it just me, or has the series gone down hill since #23??? Please, we need some real action! Also, Ax is not a real character anymore. He used to be great, but now he's so bland, and, well, stupid. He's supposed to be smart but he's really dense."
2,Big Disapointment,"When i first heard that Global Underground was working with Lostep i was very excited. Luke Chable is one of my favorite producers. but when i got the album and listened to it from start to end i was incredibly dissapointed. The Whole album has a feeling of going nowhere and the only tracks i enjoyed were Burma ( which is more than three years old) and Villian which is a great track, but this should of came out as a single only. The last song really sums up the album, Family Tennis, just some crappy blips that in Lostep's word ""Because We Can"". Dont bother purchasing this album."
4,A simple but effective frame.,"I was surprised to find just how uncommon a 12 x 18"" frame is. I knew I was not interesting in parting with a large sum of money to get one, so I avoided frame/print stores. I wanted something simple but effective, and I wasn't finding it at stationary/card/drug/department stores. This fit the bill perfectly and I was satisfied with my purchase. It is nothing flashy, but it does not look tacky either. Mounting it took all of 2 minutes and it is now serving its purpose."
1,Not recomended,"The frame was ruined on the edges when it arrived. The packaging was fine, but when I took the cardboard off the edges the paint was stripped off and hunks of the wood were missing!"
2,Cheap and Damaged,"Ordered 3 frames and 2 out of the 3 had some type of damage. One had paint chipping in the corners, and the backing of the other one was torn."
5,Really Good for beginners,"I bought this my first week of TaeKwonDo. At first it was a little overwhelming. As I learned, the book became a very useful tool. It's really great to practice the physical and read the theory and history behind it in this book. It's a great guide for practicing at home. I recommend this book for any beginner to this sport."
3,It was interesting...,"The only criticism I have about this book is that there is not much new information for those of us who have read his previous books. It's still uplifting and inspiring, but less so since I have already heard most of it before."
1,Computer May Be Fine -- but how would I know?,"I'd love to know how well this computer met my needs, but Amazon can't seem to deliver it to me. This is the second computer that they have postponed the delivery date for two months -- ON THE ORIGINAL DATE OF DELIVERY! Computer promised on April 27th (a customer service rep guaranteed this to me last night), now (April 27th) promised for June 27th.My advice, unless Amazon can resolve what appears to be a supply chain problem, is to stay clear of them for computers, because they currently cannot meet their promises. After one week, with a pending trip, I'm back to a brick and mortar outlet for a computer at the last minute.Very disappointing."
1,sanz juan carlos,hola como estan califico esta mercancia asi por que el zapato me llego talla 13 y yo lo compre talla 8 y no tube como cambiarlo y perdi los dolares y poreso tiene esa calificacion
1,used to be really good,I used to make thes cookies and cover them with powdered sugar. They were wonderful. The recipie must have changed because now they are dry and pale in conparison to the former ones. I am soooo disappointed and will not buy them again. I suspect the former rave reviews were written about the former product.
1,Don't bother,My 20 month old LOVES Barney and most of his book and DVD's are great. This book however is not a good choice. They could have thought of a better premise of learning the alphabet and food items. I would not purchase this book again and would not recommend it.
2,"It works, for a while","These are nice when you first get them. We used them exactly ONCE a year for the last few years and they stayed in a case between conferences. After the first year or so the legs got loose, and no amount of cranking down would tighten them. Then this year I pulled them out and all the legs were broken. The last good one got dropped from about 2 feet onto carpet and it snapped too. Basically the pot metal legs are crap and eventually they break. Stick with the big metal base stands if you can, these things are sometimes lighter than the mic and cable sitting in them and they have move around. Basically, they're cheap, so know what you're getting into."
4,"It was okay, but not what I thought","I don't know why, but I thought this was also about sales, it wasn't, but still a cute book/idea.."
4,"Good, but long-winded",I got the book well enough. I actually like that is was shipped USPS instead of UPS. We have issues with them were I live. The book has been useful. I am reading it for a doctoral class and I think the information inside is great. The author is very long-winded and takes too much time to support his ideas with stories.
3,"Works, but PROMT is better.","Hi, have used several of these machine translation products - Systran Premium 6, Promt Pro 6.0 and Promt Pro 9.0. Systran 6 works fairly well, but Promt 9.0 is superior, and considerably less money. Works well for taking the bulk of the effort out of quickly translating massive amounts of text... for quick preliminary research. Will crunch out published works, research docs, pdfs, but none of them will be perfect..so, you'll need a dictionary to two. I suggest you go to each of the following firms' respective websites and download their trial versions. Systran. Promt. Lec.However, the best solution is to buy a slew of flash cards, a grammar book, carve out a chunk of daily time and learn another language. The rest of the world is multi-lingual, are you? Simply a matter of memorizing a sufficient amount of vocab words, internalizing the grammatical mechanics, and meshing the two together.. for starters! Best Regards."
1,More of the same.,"This book was almost the same as book one, Dark Protector. If the characters had the same names, I wouldn't know I was reading a different book. Even the ""surprise"" ending was the same.The author made a point of telling us that Brenna was very smart, so why did she do such stupid things, and act so childish?The sex scenes were so 70's, the kind I read from Harlequin novels at age 12. I read one excerpt out loud to my husband. We laughed a lot, especially the line that said, ""Nothing and no one had ever taken her with this primitive abandon"", at which point my husband said, ""Put the puppies back in the cage.""I will not bother reading any more of her books."
3,Starts Strong. Ends Long.,"I've read the griping here about the Lionsgate treatment of ""Moonlighting"" on these dvd's, so I'll leave that alone. I hadn't seen any of the season five episodes in quite a few years, but remembered them gladly.After the disappointment of the fourth season, the series made a mighty effort to rebound in season five. Episodes two through six are terrific, and stand beside anything from season one or two for writing quality and entertainment value. But the lack of resolution of what kind of relationship Maddie and David have becomes increasingly icky.By the time Virginia Madsen shows up (season five's Mark Harmon??), and they throw another one of those awful Burt and Agnes only episodes at us, it really is a relief to get to the final ""Lunar Eclipse.""It's been sad to find through these dvd's that ""Moonlighting"" is a little dated, and when it was off it was way off. But when it worked (seasons one through three), it was great!"
1,A poor attempt,"This was a surprisingly bad book. It's not funny. It's not serious. It's sad, but in a shallow kind of way. I'm not sure for whom this book is intended...maybe young teens. Surely there are better choices about the importance of friendship than this one. The ending of this book may upset young readers, but it just made me upset at the author for not working a bit harder to make a better story. Definitely not worth having on your shelf."
4,Effective Treatment of the Equilibrium Approach,"This book provides essentially what it promises- a useful discussion of the equilibrium approach with some description of the methods applied by GSAM. The preface explicitly states that the intent of the authors was to exclude all proprietary information and they appear to have been successful in their endeavor while still providing some insight into application. I found the sections on Theory and Risk Budgeting, in particular, to provide thoughtful coverage of those topics in light of the authors' stated goals."
2,Total disappointment,The shipping was expeditiously without any problems and on time. Bad product. The cover had some scratches. The battery discharges in less than 6 hours and at times taking load off the battery.
1,lost of money,i asked for a new phone and he send me a beat up phone. its not worth buying from him. i work hard for my money and for someone to do that to someone else is wrong. he makes amazon look bad.
5,We all face barriers; the author's are just more obvious.,"Though this book is seemingly about recovery from a devastating accident, I was moved by the underlying themes; the dreams of children and parents, sexual maturation, the quest for a complete relationship, accountability, and the half-full vs. half-empty view of the world. The book is witty and moving. We all face barriers; the author's are just more obvious."
4,well ok,it look like a tv movie but the scenario is very good so it is'nt the movie of the year but if you like ghost movies you can try this onei didnT feel the time goes on and some scenes are a little bit scary but it is not the grudge
4,"Brilliant, sophisticated performance","After hearing ""Danse Russe"" on public radio, I *had* to own the CD. This collection of piano transcriptions contains eight pieces: Three from Stravinsky's Petrushka, three from Prokiev's Romeo and Juliet, Ravel's La valse, and Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue. All are great transcriptions, and technically brilliant performances. The production of the album is great -- the sound is clear, the piano Lortie plays sounds superb, and the dynamics and subtle nuances come through very well. My only complaint is the recording level is somewhat low. Clocking in at just over 55 minutes, this album is well worth the premium price."
1,Chiqueen,"Can I just say to Chiqueen, don't diss Brits. They are not all like this woman on here. You don't have to say that all British accents are like this, I'm British myself.I have this CD. The book has some nice pictures, but the CD is just a bunch of info that real Xtina fans will already know."
4,Decent Speaker Stands for the Money,"I recently went from large floor standing speakers to bookshelf size and needed something to boost my Kef's up to ear level. These stands fit the bill for me. They're inexpensive so I can spend the cash I saved on better analog kit and ruggedly made, too. The only thing that may turn some people off is the manufacturer's tag is placed on the front face of the riser, so much for aesthetics.RECOMMENDED"
5,"We love it, but not because it is a classic.","This is a classic ""B"" Christmas movie. It has 3 happy endings, Radar from MASH, Fred, and the now deceased Bert Convey taking endless phone calls on a full sized telephone in his brief case. We watch it every year, noting how many times Radar says the name Einstein, and counting phone calls. Don't expect a classic like ""A Christmas Story"", but if you can get into the ""spirit"", it is wonderful fun."
1,"Good concept, but too soft","The twist-n-treat looked promising with thick rubberized plastic much like a kong, but our border collie/australian shepard mix chewed off portions of this toy within minutes of getting all the treats out (which took about 15 seconds, even when twisted down to a very small slit). Luckily she is prone to spitting pieces like this out."
3,Good Concept not for heavy/power chewer,"The treat toy is very easy to use, but not durable for a dog with a good bite strength. I have a 45lb beagle/shepherd mix who can destroy just about any toy (2 Black Kongs (L & XL) Classic (L) Kong and special ordered (L) Blue Kong in less than 24 hours for each Kong some in a matter of 90 minutes). He was able to break a piece of this off to dispense the treats faster in about 2 to 5 minutes. I agree with most others the material is too soft. I have found that buster cube treat dispenser to be a great, can't get his mouth around it enough to bite a piece off and will play for a while even after it is empty. This toy maybe good for a soft chewer or a puppy or senior dog who does not have a full jaw strength."
1,Not worth the money,"I have four dogs. Two Rottweillers, 1 Golden Retriever, and 1 lab. I bought a lot of different toys for them at the same time. This toy lasted a total of 2 hours before my dogs had small parts laying all over the floor, not to mention the ones that they had eaten. I bought other toys that I would recommend a lot more strongly such as Omega Paw Tricky Treat ball and the triple crown everlasting treat ball."
3,Dog treats,This is made of heavy rubber which is good when you have a young puppy (chewer!)It keeps her busy for quite a while and she loves it!!
3,Breaks Easily!,"I'll reiterate what I feel like many reviewers have said - if your dog is a chewer this will be a one-time treat dispenser. I bought this for my 55lb pup and it was destroyed within the hour. Smaller dogs may like this, but if you have a dog that likes to chew and gnaw this will be a terrible investment."
2,broke nearly immediately,"I got the large size for my Border Collie, so it certainly wasn't too small, nonetheless, she split the screw-in base by trying to pry the two halves apart. This happened in the first 1/2 hour of use. Good idea, but they used the wrong material for it. The rubbery screw base just wasn't up to dog play."
3,NOT for powerful chewers!,"I am the owner of a 100 lb. Lab mix who is a VERY powerful chewer. I absolutely LOVE Premier's products! I cannot speak highly enough of the Citronella Collar, Gentle Leader, and the Busy Buddy Squirrel; these have all made my life with my dog much easier!!However, I was very disappointed with the quality of the ""Twist and Treat"", which I paid a whopping $15 for at a retail store. My dog typically goes through toys like candy, but I thought this one would be worth the money; it just sounded so darn cool! Unfortunately for my pocketbook he chewed through the plastic in 5 minutes flat. This is a very well-designed interactive toy made by a great company, but if you have a strong chewer, stick with the Kongs filled with frozen peanut butter!"
2,not at all durable,"My pit bull chewed through this in about 3 minutes flat. The gorilla kongs and bustercubes are a lot more durable. Oh well--this is expensive and too soft, at least for a vigorous chewer."
2,for nothing,"I was advised to buy it but my dog does not become the play. I go there already that not only put, and biscuits and snacks ..."
3,For a medium Puppy,"I got this to try and keep my puppy entertained. It is durable enough for him he was under 10lbs at the time and did enjoy it. However since the two pieces screw together he would sometimes rotate and close it shut. There was no lock point so you can click to a setting. It had to stay loose so i didn't find it all that stimulating and he'd get bored with it if it closed up on him. Not the best toy, glad it didn't cost too much."
3,Useful for Only So Much,"This toy is probably better used for spread-type materials like peanut butter. It's tough to put treats in, and not much fits inside if you can get treats inside.It also is tough to tighten, and I usually have to struggle with it to get it to the point where it'd be even a remote challenge for our dogs to work with.As evidenced from other reviewers, it's probably not a good idea to give to enthusiastic chewers, but I have a German Shepherd mix, Siberian Husky, and an Australian Kelpie, and there has been no damage to the toy at all. Honestly, I think the dogs get bored with it before they'd even consider chewing on it.We still use it, but it's not the dogs' favorite."
1,Destroyed in 5 Minutes,"My 7 lb. toy fox terrier chewed through the plastic in less than 5 minutes. This is the least durable toy we've tried. If your dog chews at all, don't get this toy. My dog isn't a big strong chewer and he destroyed this. Unless your dog just bats the toy around trying to get the treats out don't bother."
1,Not as good as I was hoping for,"I was hoping that this toy would survive a dog who likes to chew, but 2 hours later it was in pieces. So, if you have a dog that chews, choose something else."
3,It's okay,I bought this for my lab and great pyrenees. They liked playing with it but it didn't give them hours of enjoyment more like 15 minutes before every treat was gone and it was screwed tight for difficulty. We are going to try a kong next.
4,My dog likes this,"My Brandy is an Australian cattle dog mix, and she can chew through things when she wants to, but she hasn't chewed through this because she knows it's easier to toss it around the house to get the food out. It took her a minute to figure it out, but once she did, watch out. She loves tossing it around and chasing it through the house. Once the food is gone, she just leaves it alone and goes on to her other toys."
2,Not for strong chewers,My 25 pound Beagle ate through the toy within an hour to reach the treats. I'd refrain from buying this if your dog likes chew toys such as nylabone.
2,Premier Twist and Treat small size,"The concept of this toy is good. However, if you have a dog that needs good entertainment, knows howto get to treats, and is a strong chewer, you'll be lucky if this toy lasts two days. That's how long it lastedwith my 12lb poodle mix. He was able to gouge out chucks of rubber in no time. I think if this was madewith a hard plastic it would have been a wonderful distraction for him. And allowed me some quite time."
1,Don't waste your money!,My Yorkshire terrier mix destroyed this within 7 hours. Not durable at all. Don't waste your money.
1,Not for a chewer,"I owned the large Twist 'N Treat for use with a golden retriever who is not a powerful chewer. Yet after only 10 minutes with the Twist 'N Treat there were the sort of chomp marks on it you would expect to see in cheese, with pieces on the floor and in the dog's mouth. Needless to say, I threw out the Twist 'N Treat. Unless you have a dog who does not chew, it is not safe to give this toy to your dog. Judge your dog as a chewer, and buyer beware."
2,Chewed to Bits by a 15 Pound Dog,"I ordered this thinking that it would be something fun for our dog that might distract her for a bit while she was playing. I used it only two days before Daisy (who is only 15 pounds) chewed it to pieces. I literally looked away for 10 minutes and looked up to a trail of pieces of purple rubber all over my floor. This might work better for very tiny dogs, but if your dog is a chewer at all I'd skip this one."
1,Not for strong chewers...,My puppy at 27lbs and 9 months had this chewed to pieces in under an hour.
4,"Overpriced, but fun","We first got this toy when our puppy was about 12 weeks old. She initially got very frustrated and would yelp and bark if the food didn't come out easily. It can also tighten and close the size of the opening for food to come out. She is older now and loves playing with this toy - but it doesn't provide more than 5-10 minutes of entertainment.Not worth the price, but if you need multiple ""busy toys"" for your dog, this isn't a bad option."
4,great to keep dog busy,It keeps my dog busy for a few minutes. It doesn't keep her busy for as long as I thought it would. To let the treats out it has to be opened to a point that some fall out as it rolls around but basically it keeps her busy for a time.
1,Did not last long.,I was disappointed in this. It didn't hold much and was hard to thread together. My dogs had it broke apart in less than a week. The ball shaped toys seem to last longer IMO.
4,twist n treat,"dog seems to like it. she rolls it on the floor with her nose until the treats fall out. the only problem is that when the opening gets too small, she tries to bite through it. she's a strong chewer so I have to make sure when the toy is empty or close to empty, I take it from her so that she doesn't break it."
3,Not Forgotten...Not that good,"This book was only ok. I have read much better from Nancy Holder. The book falls short for Angel. However, the interaction between the characters is still maintained. I would not necessarily recommend this book for anyone besides super fans of ""Angel."""
2,More Skinemax Than Slasher Movie,"Burlesque Massacre is yet another disappointing horror movie that isn't much of a horror movie at all. It has far more nudity than anything that even resembles terror. I like T & A in horror movies just as much as the next guy, but it should be used sparingly. When it's the front and center of a horror movie, that's when there is a problem. That's when you know that the makers of the film didn't have much of a story or script, and so they put as much nudity in there to try to distract from it. Burlesque Massacre is more for the skinemax crowd than the horror crowd."
4,A good read,"Abandon is a meditation on longing and solitude, the collision of the Old World and the New Age, the distinction between forced and voluntary exile, and the place the reader-less text (itself an exile) occupies in all of this.The intrigues, globe-trotting and ruminations on language and religion are reminiscent of Don Delillo's The Names. If you liked that book, you will like Abandon too."
2,Universal isn't.,"I purchased these mounts for use with my Onkyo surround sound system because it was convenient that they were on Amazon and I could complete my order all together.Upon trying to use the ""universal mount"" system, I found that they didn't bolt up to my speaker system...correct capscrews were not included. Further, if I tried to fit the capscrews I needed for my speakers, the counterbored holes in the ""universal mounting"" system were too small to accept the head of the bolt.I ended up going to K-mart and buying a ""Universal mounting"" system there that worked and did a great job.Maybe they work for other surround systems, but they don't for Onkyo...not very ""Universal"" eh?"
1,Not for speakers over 5 pounds!,"I own a Klipsch surround system and needed a mount for my center speaker which only weighs 5 pounds. I purchased the PSKP-2B on 2/15/10 which stated it would holed up speakers up to 10 pounds. The premise behind the mount was good, but they will not holed up my 5 pound speaker no matter how tight you turn the locking allen screw, thus allowing the speaker to slip to its lowest point. If your speaker weighs more than 5 pounds, I would not recommend."
4,When will they give Americans ALL the episodes?,"Warren Clarke is watchable as always. As Andy Dalziel, he makes the point that being huggable is NOT a prerequisite for good detective work. Pascoe is bewildered - by his boss and by his ex - but senses rewards are afoot if he can but endure. Great to have this available -- where are the remainder of the episodes?"
1,MISADVERTISED,"BUYER BEWARE! Whoever wrote the ad for D&P Season one should be flogged. The ad says the whole season is on one disk that contains 350 minutes of material. No. You get one disk all right, but only one episode of the series that runs for about 90 minutes. BEWARE! BEWARE!"
1,Don't Care For It,"Hi,I opened the box (this is suppose to be a present for my beautiful wife) and was disappointed. It's made of the same material as found on a boat seat, albeit slightly softer. It is pretty small (as another reviewer said), and in my opinion, it's cold. What do I mean by that? It just doesn't have that comfy, 'fall in love with it,' feel. I'm pretty positive it's going back, my only question is, do I actually give this to my wife? If I do she'll probably think I bought it from big lots or Kolh's in the dollar bin. That's the actually problem with it... it doesn't have that 22.95 feel... it's got the 6.99 feel."
3,wine cube,Well when the wine cube came it was nothing like the picture. the picture shows 3 cubes that look like they are about a foot in size... I wrote to the seller to ask what the size was and never got an answer. I ordered it anyway and when it came it was one huge cube about 2 foot by 2 foot. I couldnt use it for where I ordered it for but I kept it and am using it somewhere else in my home. I am happy with the product but not happy with the way it was advertised because it was nothing like what the picture looks like.
4,Buy it for the artwork.... the words aren't too bad either,"My family owns two Peter J Lippman books and we are crazy about them. My son and I love trains and this book has a lot of factual information about them that even a 4 year old can grasp. But the true reason we read Mr. Lippman's books is because of the artwork. So much detail is placed into these pictures that each time you read the book you see something new. For instance, on the title page the conductor is holding a ticket that is really a place for your child to sign their name. It says ""one ticket to be used anytime, issued by Busy Trains. Good for as many rides as you like and it is signed by P. Lippman, Engineer."" Definitely a step above Thomas so check it out."
2,NOT for powerful chewers!,Great idea and love Busy Buddy toys but my Doberman destroyed it in 5 minutes!~What a waste!
2,Not for chewers,Total time spent before toy was destroyed? 20 minutes by an extremely enthusiastic newfie. She didn't even try to figure it out.
2,Didn't last long,"Our Scottish terrier is 19 lbs and she made short work of this, it took about an hour before she ripped a piece off of one end."
2,Treat Meter is just ok,"The treat meter are plastic fingers you have to cut to get the treats to come out. The problem with that is given you cut it off, if you cut too much, you can't undo it."
5,One of My Favorite,"This book is about a girl who lives in an old house, and there is a secret bedroom in which odd things happen (I won't tell you exactly what happens because I don't want to ruin it for you). But I will say that the things that happen are interesting and wants to keep you reading until you find out what exactly is going on.The ending was very satisfying. We found out the ""why's"" and ""how's"" and all questions and curiosities were answered. I wish I could say more, but I don't want to spoil it.This is a ""teen horror"", and I am an adult. I feel this book was entertaining and interesting enough for a child, teen, or an adult. This book is one of my favorite R.L. Stine books (that I am so crazy over, no matter how old I get)."
5,Works well.,The vest works well for my commute on my bike. It's a lightweight mesh with a small piece of velcro on the front. It works just as advertised.
1,Dangerous and Irresponsible!,"An Army general rules his neighborhood, enforcing order and quiet. When a family moves in that doesn't conform, he calls in the Army, which sends in hundreds of men and bombs and helicopters and which ultimately, tears out a house and a family is never heard from again. Awful, stupid and ignorant nonsense, particularly during a time when our armed services are defending the rights of all individuals. The book is simplistic, full of guile, disingenous with pretty illustrations and seemingly good messages. One of the worst books ever marketed to children -- what were the publishers thinking?"
4,"Good, but not great","This tome explores the chicken throughout the ages. Excellent graphics and many good pictures and stuff. I would have preferred more of how the chicken has contributed to culture throughout the ages. Having said that, the book's writer has a great affinity for the bird. Lovingly done and very factual. Recommended."
1,Misleading art,"Don't be fooled by the cover art. All they did was take the cut parts out of the videos, no new art besides intro and 'commercial' breaks. I am a HUGE DBZ fan and I was greatly disappointed by this product (as I already have the old version)"
5,Great product,I work for the military abd they love this tape! It's perfect for white boards and its durable. I do recommend it!
5,Right On! Mr. Strawter,This book is a must read for anyone involved with children or teens. It provides a very In-depth look at what can go wrong in the family circle as well as ideas of how to stay in front of the warning signs we often miss. I have witnessed countless examples in our community where situations could have been changed had the parents only known what to look for. Mr. Strawter had the foresight and the passion to offer a tool to spread this word. Put this book on the front of your list to give to all new parents.
5,Sanus Systems MF215-B1,The unit worked and fit well to my LG 27 inch LCD TV. A couple others I tried covered part of the connector area. Made with good quality material with a single stud mount keeps the set sturdy and easy to attach to the wall with supplied lag bolts. The gimble mount is difficult to get adjusted to keep unwanted rotating and the built in wire way is small but both manageable. Plenty of hardware to fit several screw sizes.
3,Warning for newer SAMSUNG LED tvs,"If you own a Samsung LED tv, mine was a 32in, Sanus did not include the correct screws for it. It requires 4 M8x25mm screws which the only M8 that was included was a M8x30mm which is too long, will not work. Called Sanus and they said this is a common issue with newer Samsung models, you'll need to buy the M8x25 screws at a hardware store or Sanus will mail you some. You need to go to a good hardware store(wide selection, check out Acehardware(commercial/industrial type store) and they will have them.Another warning, the instructions for puttin in the the screw in to the pivot tells you to put the bolt at the bottom and cover at the same time, don't do it yet! you need to hold the tiny bolt while screwing in the screw from top.Took me a long time to find a hardware store that would carry the screws. Once the correct screws and the pivot screw method was taken care of, the mount works beautifully. Be Warned!"
5,Cool little device.,This thing is great. I was able to record a few shows in HD right on to my hard driver and then watch them back on an airplane. Pretty nifty product.
3,Pctv HD Pro Stick,"I tried the Pctv HD Pro Stick USB2 in Windows XP, and it worked just fine; however, I upgraded to Windows Vista and downloaded the new software for it, and the remote control will not funtion. It works better in Windows XP then in Windows Vista."
1,NOT Genuine Brother -- BEWARE!,"This toner is NOT a genuine Brother TN350. It is a ""compatible"" model, but nowhere in the product description is this made clear - or even hinted at. I am returning the product and will rate the seller on how easily the return goes."
1,No Pulse,"Topic is fairly intriguing, especially Burnham's expert knowledge on issues of self-interest, but writing itself is overall clunky and dull. You find yourself wishing for more spark, warmth and humor in place of the cold, arid, repetitive fact-spewing."
1,Dissapointing Product,"I purchased two extender chains which arrived in a beautiful luxurious boxes ready for gifting. Personally a waste for such a small and practical item. I used one of the chains to extend a necklace I really like and within a few hours of wearing the necklace the chain extender broke. I tried to piece it together and put my necklace back again. Within minutes the chain broke again in a different area. This item is adversited by a well renound artist, but I was dissapointed that her name is part of this badly constructed and cheap item. I will not purchase from this artist again and recommend that you do not waste your time and money. Highly dissapointing."
3,chain link bigger than expected,"Chain link is bigger than expected and did not look like sterling silver, a little darker silver color but did fit the need and free shipping."
5,THE MAGIC IN LIFE BEGINS!!!!,"SO INSPIRING! Once I touched the book, and then read it, magic started to happen. Sharon brings very vivid, candid, clear, enlightened messages. Her approach teaches how to ignite and connect with our own inner magnetic attraction to produce wondrous life manifestations. What's the best part?! To partake of this feast immediately! A fun and light approach to a very complex subject. LUV'd it! What an awesome piece of work she has blessed us with! Cynthia Hicks, Scottsdale, Az."
4,"Good, but prepare carefully","I tried some of this some time back, and realized I didn't review it until I came back for more. This stuff is pretty good. Excellent aroma, did not leave much grit or residue when brewed. Very tasty.The only drawback is you have to be very careful in your preparation, more than 2-3 minutes and it will become very strong and bitter. Before that point it is very smooth and required no milk or sugar. It kept very well, I went away for several months after opening it and it was tasted just fine when I got back."
3,Unlocked phone for cheap,"Lets be straight; this tiny phone was bought for one reason, to replace my main phone of a 2-year plan that is beyond its one-year warranty. Nevermind any of the reasons why the original phone is dead, at the end of the day, it would cost almost $150 to replace it thru my service provider, or anymore else for that matter.I needed a cheap unlocked phone to last the next 3 months for when I can have a free replacement if I re-sign my 2-yr contract. This phone is it. It has some minor games, the keypad isn't too small, and the sound is crystal clear with an excellent speaker.That being said, I wouldn't buy this phone just to have. The menu is hard to understand, the keylock doesn't seem to work, saving phone numbers is tedious and limited."
2,bad phone,I've had the phone for 1 month now and the buttons are already starting to sieze up. Chinese crap!
1,indyroy,Just got the phone. Love the way it looks and feels. Went to Sprint to activate/switch from old flip-phone to this Nokia 1600 to find out it DOES NOT WORK WITH SPRINT!! What a suprise. Sure would like to have known that $51.00 ago.
4,TV vampires have never been better.,"A battle to the death in the 18th century drives Angel to protect a lovely innocent actress who is not a vampire but plays one on TV. The intense hunger for her blood, her life which once drove him to destroy her is now replaced by an irrational desire for atonement. But is she the same woman who had vowed to kill the vicious Angelus? Has her hate kept her alive for 200 years for one purpose and one purpose alone...to kill the vampire who took her life? The story ripples with action and danger. Cults,spirits, bookies and the LAPD insist on interferring in Angel's quest for redemption. Doyle and Cordelia provide the comic relief with their friendly bickering. Especially amusing is Cordelia suggesting that they make a TV series out of Angel's life. I strongly recommend this book. I read it all in one sitting."
4,"Nice, but wash before wearing and ONLY with colors!","This is a cool top. I bought it for a 10k run I was doing near Halloween where lots of folks wear costumes. I did not wash it first and it ran black into the sweat around my neck (yuck!). However, a friend pointed out that if I had washed it first, I might not have realized the color would run, so perhaps it was good to know that! It fit really long. Served it's purpose though. And it's a durable shirt."
2,"Dream on, Saalman","I just finished this... got it in the marked down bin at the local bookstore for $5. How could I go wrong? Long Introduction by Robert Anton Wilson, one of my favorites... but he only used the space to push some of his own favorite ideas, again. I couldn't tell if he had read this book at all (said he didn't want to ""give away the plot""). In any case, it was terrible, awful, trite, and unconnected. Too many characters, with no development. Lots of hints at a Great Hidden Idea, but sorry, it never happened. Really awful writing too. But once I start a book, I'll finish it, no matter how bad. This one was really tough to get through, though. So much so, that I felt obligated to write this review. In retrospect, I tried to change it to one star, but they won't let that happen once you've made a choice."
3,More than impressive,"When I first heard Belshazzar's Feast I immediately decided to buy it. The way the themes repeat themselves and the voices intermingle, is really very impressive. Unfortunately the music turned out to be too much for my boxes and for my partner. And the differences in volume turn listening to it in the car to a dangerous experience. I recommend Belshazzar's Feast only to advanced listeners with a good set of headphones."
2,Don't know,My cat has an inflamed bladder from stress and is a very picky eater. I thought I would try these to see if they helped with her bladder issues. I never got to find out because she refuses to eat them. I am giving her Cosequin with her can food at night and that seems to help.
3,Uri-Ease soft chews chicken & tuna,"I purchased this product along with uri-ease paw gel for cats after a vet suggested the uri-ease might help my cat with a bladder stone. Out of 11 cats, three love the soft chews and the others will not touch them (could be they do not like the flavor). They all like the paw gel."
1,Pyle or pile of @*^%,"I do mobile electronic installations at a best buy, so I know what I am doing. When I first pulled this out of the box it looked to have a few to many scratches to be new. Then I noticed that the clip that holds the plug together was scratched up like someone had used a screwdriver to press on it. I started to install this in my car then decided it would be a good idea to bench test it to make sure it worked right befor I installed everything. I am glad I did because it didn't work right. I opened up the case to look at the circut board and it looked like they decided to use an old board to make this remote start, there were spots where components had been removed from the circut board. There is not enough info in the instructions about the wires, and that is coming from someone that installs remote starts for a living. I am getting a replacment sent to me so we will see if the next review is better or worse."
1,Bad machine.,This Roma Food Strainer Deluxe and Sauce Maker disassembles itself while you are using it. You must pass the tomatoes more than three times. You need a second person help you to hold the machine while you move the handle because the suction cup is not enough.
4,Great for thin hair,This product was recommended to me by a stylist. I have fine hair and blow drying and curling easily causes breakage. This product helps to strengthen the hair which produces a thicker look. Don't over do it. Use it only once or twice a week. I definitely see a difference when I use this product over a few months time. Don't look for overnight results.
1,Did not work. A dud,"This item is a dud. Do not buy. I ordered two sets. One arrived cut in half, the other did not work at all.I think the company selling this garbage also know they don't work, because the moment I contacted them about their item they processed a refund immediately before I even asked."
5,As good as it gets,"This is music that just begs to be listened to extremely loud at night in a dimly lit room on a high quality turntable. This is real music. As Buddy Guy says, ""so funky you can smell it!"" (or maybe my carpet just needs to be cleaned...)"
2,Not for the discriminating palate,"My cat loves, loves, loves tuna but does not even recognize these treats as food; she gave them the briefest of sniffs then looked at me expectantly as if to say, ""So, where's the treat you promised?"" She is undeniably a picky eater so I tried giving some to the alley cats that hang out down the street; their response was exactly the same. One or two of them did eventually decide the things were edible, but didn't seem to want more.If your cat is the sort who live for food and will eat anything, this might be a good treat for him; otherwise, I don't recommend it."
3,worked good. bought it for hookah coals.,worked ok. i only bought this to light hookah coals. got them to lite. thats all i cared about.
1,"It not hot, it may called warm.",It's just awful. Do not buy it if you're looking for a real stove top. I'm serious! The hottest out of it is like 2 or 3 on a regular stove!
2,Good for 3 months,"I used this as an everyday burner, but after 3 months its on-light indicator went out, and burner stays on even after turning it off. I expected more but for $20.00 what can I say?"
1,ELEPHANT TRACKS,THE BOX IT CAME IN WAS FINE BUT THE UNIT LOOKED AS THOUGH SOMETHING VERY HEAVY HAD LANDED ON IT. I WOULD OF LIKED TO HAVE USED IT TO GIVE A REVIEW OF ITS PERFORMANCE BUT INSTEAD I HAD TO RETURN IT. I ALSO WANTED TO POST PICTURES BUT DONT THINK I COULD HAVE BEING THAT THEY ARE SO NEGATIVE.
1,Broken after 1 1/2 months,"The left burner quit working less than 2 months after purchasing. I use this about 3 times a week and expected it to last longer. Unfortunately, it's past the return window and I'd only get a partial refund and have to pay return shipping at this point. So I'll just keep it and use the right burner until it goes out. Really really disappointing. I'll buy another one, but not this brand."
4,i like it,"I ordered several different hot plate single burner cookers to see which one I liked best, and this one won. It's sturdy and heavy.. and unlike all the others, it can be CLEANED....which greatly prolongs its life..Impossible to clean the others... so they get tossed after a few months. Some of the cheaper models didn't heat properly after a while, and even became an electrical hazard so had to be discarded. This one seems to be a better made unit.The control settings are accurate, and nice to have 3 cook settings, plus a 4th 'warm' setting."
2,Stopped working!!!,"Stayed warm when turned off.Suddenly stopped working after 4 months (even though I hardly ever used it).Need to buy another electric burner, but don't know what company to go with."
1,Defective On Arrival,"I hate to rate something so low, but my experience warrants a low score.The larger burner was defective from the onset - the knob turned but the burner remained on, and at full it seemed, regardless of the knob's setting. I had to unplug and plug in the unit to turn it off and on. The smaller burner worked!Amazon was nice enough to refund me in full and even paid for the return shipping as well. Packing seemed fine too, guess it was a manufacturing defect. Hopefully this doesn't happen to many others."
1,Don't plan on using more than once!,"Bought this to use under a Cameron's stovetop smoker (which shouldn't be placed directly on a glass cooktop because of the corrugated bottom). I only needed a burner for medium heat. I got medium heat out of it the first time I used it, but the second time I used it, the best it could do was MAYBE keep a cup of coffee warm. The third time it didn't work at all. Total junk!"
4,Great Hot Plate! Opps - stopped working,"Amended: After using this hot plate daily for about 1 1/2 months, it has suddenly stopped heating. I love it for how quick it heats, compact and clean looking. I will order another and cross my fingers. If it keeps working, I will return my rating to 5 stars.I love this hot plate. It fits compactly in my small area, heats up quickly, boils water fast (I have to reduce it to medium once boiling starts) and...it looks smart and clean sitting out in site. I like having the indicator light to quickly tell me if it is on or not. Very well built. It arrived very quickly!"
4,aroma hot plate,I ordered this item because a couple of ladies in my jewelry class has one. We use it for the Keumbo application and this is the only hot plate that gets hot enough for this application. It works very well. I was referred to them to order through amazon.
1,More Than Nausea,"This hodgepodge of anecdotes will undoubtedly prove fascinating to the legion of Carson worshippers, but for those who are somewhat less enamored of Carson, it will serve to confirm that most of Carson's guests were as stale, uninteresting, and boorish as the great Carson himself - this one is for rabid Carson groupies only."
3,Clue Lover's Delight,"What a fun premise, even though death and mayhem are woven through the story. For anyone who likes to solve puzzles and figure out clues, this trilogy is a a good read. The first two books in the series are better than the third, but to figure out who is behind the nuttiness, you have to read all three, for it all to make sense. Some romance of course but that aspect is less important to the main character than solving the primary clue. Overall, an easy read that at times, will keep you guessing throughout the story."
1,Big Disappointment!,Wow! I was expecting a lot more. Good idea but not very well put together. Very boring and unentertaining. I fast forwarded through most of it. The ending was very disturbing and should have been edited down. It kept dragging on. Good shock value but not done very well. I definately wouldn't recommend it.
1,Terrible. Simply terrible.,"As my title suggests, this movie was terrible. The only good thing about it, is now me and my friends have something to make fun of for a little bit. First of all, how are these actresses supposed to be 14? They were at least 17 or 18. Add their terrible acting to the mix and you've got a terrible movie. The director clearly does not know how teenagers truly act, no 14 year old would be doing hard drugs and kissing other girls. Again, that's more 17 or 18 year olds. And for the last 22 minutes, half of it was just either him digging a hole, or filling said hole up. I do not recommend this movie at all."
4,Good Condition,"As described, some writing in book, however overall book in good condition and price very reasonable"
5,Clean As IT Gets,"This is some of the best music ever recorded! They're gone, but the music lives on. It's all clean and simple with harmonies that will move you. A little known band that was ahead of its time and to good to know it. Mason Proffit wrote songs with a message that transends time. If I could just find their cd with ""The Balad of Eugene Pratt, I'd have everything they ever recoreded and be a happy man. A musician myself, I can only say this stuff is awesome!"
4,Testimony,"Mason Proffit joins Buffalo Springfeild in testifying to the new document that taught us all we need to do more. More for the environment, more to dismantle the John Birch/NRA body politic, ..... more for the revolution. Mason Profitt reminded us we are not doing enough to challenge our corrupt government, unfair trials, neglect of Native American treaties, racism...then there was Jackson State and Kent State. Then Nixon (not to mention 'nam), Watergate. What have we learned?"
5,boys' t-shirts wash and wear great!,I'm very pleased with the t-shirts. They've washed up well and the collars continue to lay flat.
4,"Wonderful, but the best are absent","I am overjoyed that these fine performances have finally been released at a reasonable price (I was beginning to suspect that those holding the rights wanted to suppress their distribution); however, I am disappointed that the three most amusing, accessible, and perhaps best performances in this series are absent from this collection: Twelfth Night, Much Ado about Nothing, and The Merry Wives of Windsor. Merry Wives is by far the funniest of the comedies produced in this series, and although there have been recent productions of the other two plays, the performances in this series are superior in both cases. If five plays had to be chosen for this collection, the three mentioned above should have been chosen in favor of The Tempest, Midsummer Nights Dream, and As You Like it. Perhaps these will be released in a future collection. In spite of this, I would whole heartedly recommend buying this collection of fine performances."
3,BBC Shakespeare Comedies,"While the quality of the BBC produced Shakespeare plays is terrific, the copy quality of the DVD's, from Ambrose DVD, is not. The very first comedy that I watched, The Taming of the Shrew, had a scratched DVD, which meant that the production froze-up several times as I watched it. The other four DVD's look clean, but I haven't played them yet."
1,Beware!,"This boxed set was a gift. Of the five plays presented therein, four: As You Like It, Merchant ..., ... Shrew and Tempest are defective, playing well for the first couple acts and then dissolving into all manner of pixels, black bands, freeze frames, and frustration. Looking at some of the other reviews of the series, I see the same complaints. Maybe the problem lies in a particular pressing and has subsequently been corrected. In any case, BEWARE!"
5,Hooks not an issue for me,"Simple device, a cargo net made from bungee cords. Some other people have mentioned that the removable hooks were an issue for them. I'm found during my use that the hooks stay in place quite well even when the net is not stretched out. In fact, I like the flexibility of being able to move the hooks around on the net, give you many more tie down options on the bike frame and rack. Overall this is a very handy device for hauling stuff on your bike."
2,Not worth the extra money even for being green,The 7th Generation Lunch Napkins were a disappointment. We end up using twice as many because they are so thin. They would be fine for a picnic where a lot of napkin would get wasted to begin with but for regular home usthey aren't so great.
3,Fiesta Latina Vol. 3,Great latin music. I hate the cd cover. I don't think is necesary to show a woman's behind to sale a good cd. Amazon offers great samples and you can decide if you like it or not.
4,"Very, very loud","I got this horn after I nearly got hit by 2 cars (who weren't looking before turning right) within 2 miles. Luckily, I haven't had a repeat of that day yet, but I'm confident that this horn is loud enough to grab any driver's attention.I'm a little disappointed in the sound of the horn- it sounds like a really loud kid's toy horn. So, even though it's definitely loud enough for cars to hear, I wish it had a little deeper, more ""serious"" sound to it.I also find it a little difficult to use it with my air pump- the floor pump's tube isn't long enough to reach it while it's mounted on the handlebar so I have to unmount it and unwind some of the horn's tubing to get it low enough."
5,Absolute must for city cyclists!,"This horn has prevented countless accidents on my commute in downtown Washington, DC. It's LOUD! It is great for both city streets and shared-use paths: even drivers distracted by their cell phones and joggers wearing headphones are easily alerted of my presence.The product performs well especially when it is fully charged. It holds it's charge for a while, but does get quieter at the end of the tank. Very fast and easy to fill with a bike pump. Very lightweight and easy to install. I have not seen any comparable products on the market.In summary: this horn is a critical tool for any city cyclist and I highly recommend it to anyone.UPDATE: Winter has come and the horn does not work well in cold (below freezing) temperatures. That said, the manufacturer does warn you of this on the packaging..."
4,Delta Airzound Horn,"After almost getting clobbered twice over the winter holidays, I decided to invest in a horn that would get drivers' attention. I needed something substantial that was more than a toot-toot or ring-ring.Pluses: Sound -- Strong db level and good pitch (a lot like a boat horn).Weight -- Reasonable for its size.Air Supply Tubing -- lots. I cut it down just a bit and instead of wrapping the tubing around my frame I used a few wire wraps to make it a tidy mount.Minuses: Supply Bottle -- Bulky. It's about the size of a water bottle.Bottle Mount -- Cheezy. I tore off the glued-on cover and flimsy mounts. I placed the bottle in one of my water bottle cages.Horn Mount -- Workable but not great. The supplied collar was not large enough in diameter to fit my road bike bars so I ended up mounting the horn with a couple of criss-crossed wire wraps.Recommendation: I would purchase it again but would like to see improvements as noted above. A connector for a CO2 cartridge might be sweet."
5,Great Bicycle Horn,"Well it got its first use on my way home from the store. A huge truck pulled right into the cross walk and stopped. One loud blast and the driver moved his rig! Totally worth it.Now that's on my bike I have a tendency to be a little less forgiving to drivers. That guy who pulled out in front of me, ok, I'm not going that fast and he made it, but it was rude of him, so two light taps and he slowed down and drove sort of sheepishly. I think that he knew that pulling out wasn't the right thing to do...There is a volume control and I have it set pretty loud for autos as you can't really adjust it while riding and pay attention to the road. Ped's still get a ""hey buddy!"", as my voice is still working fine.I'm using the velcro attachment as my bike has only one water bottle cage and it works fine. The hose is plenty long enough to mount it wherever you want it.Not having to buy refills is really nice, its light. easy on and off for commuting storage."
5,Great Company to deal with,"My rating is actually 4.8 !I bought this AirZound horn about eight month ago and its been a life saver for me, when it developed a leak in the tube, I contacted the manufacturer and immediately they put in the mail a repair kit. No charge. That is worth a good recommendation.It is loud and somewhat easy to operate and with a company that backs it up. What more could you ask for!I don't know if it is possible, but my only suggestion is that I would have like the operating button better if it could be mounted nearer the handle grip so it can be pushed without removing the hand from the grips. It will make it even safer.Their website offers other helpful hints worth reading."
3,good,good while it lasted. i bought another that doesn't have the hose running from the bottle and it works just as well with less fuss and less packaging.
2,Does not last,"Bought airzound used it for awhile and it stopped working,bought a second one as it is loud but it also failed.no matter how loud it is it is no use to you if it don't work.the mounting brackets are real cheap plastic,I ended using rebar wire to tie on the horn to the handle bar.I ordered the second on the off chance that I got a bad one the first time but same problems with number two.So save your money and look else where,the time you might really need the horn it might not work.Just ordered The Hornit bike horn,more expensive but willing to pay the extra for safety sake.Will see how it works out..."
2,Underwhelming -- Flimsy & Overpriced,"It's loud, but not as loud as I expected or hoped. I didn't get to actually use it as the flimsy plastic trigger hinge was factory-broken, right out of the box.A replacement is on the way, but I don't really expect this item to hold up in use. Its all-plastic construction is just too fragile and poorly engineered at stress points. The mounting system is also inadequate. It's very toylike, but toys are usually more rugged than this.In view of what this thing really is, the MSRP is at least four times too high. Great idea, very poor execution."
5,This thing Blows!!!!!!,"This works like a charm, I have houses next to me with dogs who they leave to fend for themselves when they let them out to do their business. When he begins to bark continuously, I hit the horn. It stops immediately, and yes we have exhausted all other avenues."
5,Enlivening,"This is the slowest version of the Eighth Symphony I ever have heard. It lasts over 30 minutes. Nevertheless, it never seems to drag. Thomson lovingly elucidates all the details of the score. It is arguable that this is not what Vaughan Williams wanted, since he heard performances by Barbirolli and Boult (Decca) that reached LP during his lifetime. But Thomson clearly loves this music, and has found a key to its structure. The last movement is eloquent rather than typically rambunctious, and the conclusion is very satisfying. The other works on the CD are less controversial. The Partita receives a superb performance. The plucked strings in the third movement's Homage to Henry Hall, a BBC dance band leader, are particularly evocative of lighter music. Greensleeves goes well, comparably to the famous Ormandy recording. And the Hymn-Tune Preludes are serious and telling. Add to all this superior sound engineering, and you have a fascinating slice of Vaughan Williams."
1,These will make your eczema worse,I had horrible eczema a few months ago. I itched and itched and went to my dermatolgist. She asked me what I was using and I said Grandpa's tar soap. She looked at me with horror and told me to stop using immediately. She said the soap is way too drying for eczema and that it only feels better temporarily because of the cooling agent. Stay away from this if you eczema!
4,does what it's meant to do,"I was a bit disappointed that this basket's handles are bent over the basket (they get in the way of placing baby inside), that there is a large warning sewn into the inside that you cannot remove (it looks hideous, and that the fabric is not tight on the sides (so I worry about the safety). The basket is also very long and narrow, but I'm assuming the measurements are advertised, and that I did not pay attention to them. After all that, the basket keeps my little one out of my bed, but close enough that I don't have to stumble to her room half asleep, so I'm keeping it!"
3,should have been better,"The book gets 3 stars because of sloppy editing and proofreading (i.e.p.148: ""He housed Kate and Laura and the Hays-Adams Hotel"" and clearly wrong information: p. 138 ""In the late 1930s, when she was a struggling actress, Katharine Hepburn had waited for an interview...in Harris's offices above the Moresco Theatre."" ; p. 141 ""In 1933, several years after her stint as Harris's driver, ...Kate arrived, fresh from California, at Harris's offices above the Moresco Theatre."" Hepburn was a struggling actress in the late 1920s, not the late 1930s.At times, pages read as if they had been written by assistants who did not keep up with what had preceded their contribution. Information is needlessly repeated. And, the writing is inconsistent. veering from good to sophomoric to good to bad to good again.Hepburn deserved better."
1,Needs better explanatio of product.,"I thought I was getting a usable pad that could be used instead of a board. However, it is just the pad with no cover and can't be used to roll out dough. Not happy."
4,An Evening With Danny Kaye,"I purchased this VHS casette from AMAZON US. I liked it, my son too.We watched nearly 4 times in a last week.Quality is satisfied, sound is clean and stereo. Show has 2 act.Please purchase and watch it and your smile will be stay forever on your face. This show is for all ages."
2,Ehh...,I was a little disappointed with this CD. I almost found myself bored when listening to it. I expected a little more from Reba...
5,*WOWZER*,"You have to love Reba. She still sounds amazing after recording for overthirty years. What other female but Dolly can claim that. Her voice is so clear and stong. She sounds better than she has in years.I am so over Kenny Chesney, but if you can listen to ""EVERY OTHER WEEKEND"" without having your heart ripped out then you are not human. They do a beautiful job together and kudos also to the writers. If MCA doesn't release this as a single then someone should lose their job.There are many other standouts, too many to mention, but there is not a throw away track on this CD. This album only proves while there may be many other CMA Female Vocalists of the year out there, she is among an extremely select group that actually deserve the title.Check out ""Because of You"" and ""Every Other Weekend"""
1,misleading,"Don't get me wrong-I am a diehard Reba fan and always will be but I have to say that I was terribly disappointed with this album. I thought with all of the fanfare that it would be a top notch cd, but instead it was a very weak album when you look at who is on and who is not. I can't wait for the real Reba to step up to microphone."
4,An eclectic mix,"As one who appreciates a variety in music I have thoroughly enjoyed Reba's ""Duets"" CD. Each song has a different flavor due to the variety of artist pairings. This compilation is not just for the country music lover!"
5,Wonderful!,"I can relate to three of theses songs.It is awesome,and so far it is one of my favorites from Reba.She is my idol.She talks about love and how love can hurt in so many ways.It is calming if you are going through a hard time in a relationship.I recomend this cd!"
5,Reba!,"Reba is by far my favorite artist ever. I like all genres of music so for this duets cd to come out is awesome.I'm not a really really big fan of Kelly Clarkson, but I have to say that her track with Reba is my favorite of the whole cd. Because of You was a good song made even better!"
3,interesting,"while Colabs are the norm all over other forms of Music it is a interesting concept from a Country Music artist and yet this works pretty well here. Reba is a talented vocalist and her voice blends well with the various artists she is working with here. the arrangements compliment her rather well. i like her colabs best with Kelly Clarkson,Faith Hill and Leann Rimes. it has a charm about it that works."
1,FLUFF!,"I listen to this and I just wonder what might have been. I saw a video on You Tube the other day with Reba doing a duet with ""Connie Smith"" singing Marty Robbins' ""Singing the BLues"". I was hoping to hear her do some stuff with ""real legends"" like ""Parton"", ""Lynn"" or ""Connie Smith"". Instead we have people like Justin Timberlake. Yuck!"
1,Not good enough unless you're a pro at circuits.,"This book is ~ok, i needed supplements to understand the course material, the author, which is very knowledgable is not the best teacher. Another reason why this book does not teach the material very well"
2,A Resounding Truth...written terribly.,"Don't get me wrong, I agree with most of what Miss Manners has to say about the general superiority of American manners in the field of equality, but the book itself is just jummbled. The first twenty pages read more like a sprawling rant that didn't really have any kind of format or purpose, like someone who has something very profound to say but just can't say it."
5,"Rockford Goes Down Swinging again, maybe",Have you ever seen any TV star get sucker punched so often and wake up wondering what hit him. I love it when he becomes an insurance investigator or a mortician...he just thumbs through a parcel of business cards for the occasion and turns on his acting/acting charms...what a guy this Rockford. Sure to become a classic gum-shoe series for the ages!
5,Rockford Files,I'm going to keep ordering until I have the complete set for Rockford Files..better than most of the stuff on TV nowdays
4,perfect apsc zoom lens,"I use it with my D7000, it is a all purpose lens. Fundamentally it is very sharp even at f2.8, some of my f2.8 zoom lens dose not give me sharp image at f2.8 (so why don't they just made them f4?). And its contrast and bokeh are very good. The most important point to me is it's f2.8, yes, for a apsc body, its iso performance is not as good as full frame body, so if you want high shutter speed (in event photography), you need fast aperture to ensure the image quality."
3,not as sharp as I expected,"Need to do more photo test, seems like have focus problem using autofocus, maybe back or front focus, not shure, problems to focus when there are low light conditions, when try to take pictures at 17mm or wide, was not focused whet check it later.when the photo is well focused, look fine, not as the 50mm f/1.8"
4,Nice,"The book excellently and up-to-date describes the technical issues and is so well-written that we may read it and be glad we did, but it is also so nice and lacks an inspiring ending that we may not do much about Internet security for our Macintoshes once we have put the book down."
2,Wok in a box,"Wok was excellent quality, came with no lid though I thought the description led you to believe there was one? The shipping box was extremely damaged, wok was loose in the box, unreal, just some loose paper for packing. But I suppose for the price paid what else was I to expect, its a nice wok!"
5,My fish are still alive!,"Good value, my flowerhorns are growing and breeding. Wish they had an even more economical size. Tip: don't over feed your fish."
2,Need to offer this product in various size pellets. not just small.,"This product was delivered in a timely manner, but, if you have an adult oscar fish I would not recommend this product. The pellets were way too small. This would be great for a smaller oscar in size while still growing. Great product as far as not clouding up your fish tank, but would be better if Amazon would offer this product in Small, Medium, Large sized pellets."
1,Stay out of the casbah,"I bought this book because of its Algerian setting and was predisposed to like it. Unfortunately, I didn't connect with the writing at all. It might have been a weak translation, but somehow the dark, depressive atmosphere established from the novel's get-go was too much to overcome for me. The storyline is not particularly strong and none of the characters were engaging. Perhaps Khadira's other books are better, but I wouldn't be inclined to find out."
5,incredibly moving book,"This compilation is marvelously well-edited and includes an incredible variety of letters from soldiers and civilians from numerous wars. The author has put together a very nuanced, clear-eyed, resonant and moving collection and has written helpful, insightful descriptions throughout the book. This book would make a great gift."
4,stupid!,"this thing is so stupid. this thing should come with a lcd screen. i mean who would be so stupid to bring a battery when you cant even see what your playing? most people with brains would use the plug. And my neighbor bought this then he sAId he wanted to ""try it out"". he charged it for like 2 hours and it let us play for about 45 minutes. i advise nobody to buy this. and i repeat.. . IT IS COMPLETELY STUPID!"
5,So Good I had to buy a copy!,I had originally checked this out from my public library but found the information so useful that I bought a copy for my own personal library. Very good and practical information to inspire and motivate you to write!
2,TNA Hard Justice 2009 Review,The PPV failed to move the storylines and push any wrestlers. The only good matches are the Legends title match between Mick Foley & Kevin Nash which was a real bloodbath and a good reminder of Mick's days in ECW and the Falls Count Anywhere match for the Tag Team title match between The Main Event Mafia(Booker T & Scott Steiner) & Team 3D(Brother Ray & Brother Devon) which was an arena-wide brawl that everyone excel at and a good reminder of the Steiner Bros.-Nasty Boys-NWA U.S tag team title match from Halloween Havoc 1990. The rest stink like a 5 year old hamburger. I give this dvd a 3 out of 10.
5,Selling the Sizzle without Burning the Steak,"Leave it to someone who writes about the virtue of frugality to produce a book that, by design, is a bargain. Shel Horowitz is a publicist extraordinaire, and ""Grassroots Marketing"" is head and shoulders above the crowd in its genre because it contains timeless information that is both creative and economically practical. Whether you are an entrepreneur, an independent publisher or a media magnate, your efforts in securing publicity must address economic sensibility or at some point you will likely experience failure. This is a terrific book. Highly recommended."
5,Must Have,"If your a fan of metal, then this is the cd to own. Coal Chamber, Fear Factory, and Sepultura are just a few of the bands from the Roadrunner catalog. Not a bad track to be had."
5,This is a classic,"This cd has not just have the classic songs and bands like Sepultura,Fear Factory,and King Diamond but have also introduce us and everyone to the new bands Like Killswitch Engage,Chimira,Ill Nino and of course the best band to ever set foot on this planet-Slipknot.Everyband and every song that has been picked to be on this cd ,is put in the perfect spot at the perfect time.I cannot tell you when the last time I have heard a great cd with such a sweet lineup.This is a classic and needs to be in every rock/metalheads collection.If some people do not have this cd.You are not a true metal Fan."
2,"A Few Nice Things, Mostly Not","There are a few nice pieces in this book but not enough to warrant a whole book. There is one picture I spotted as being identical to a picture on another page. Many of the items one could see by going to a Copper and Brass store that sells new items. I now have the book, ""Metalwork in Early America : Copper and It's Alloys from the Winterthur Collection,"". If you want in-depth information on antique copper and brass, I'm afraid you're going to have to go the money. This is what I was looking for when I bought this other book. Save your money."
1,Horrible,"This book was just horrible. No plot, no character development, and then there's the stupid fight scenes. I wonder if Jean Rabe could write a worse book."
4,"As good as I should have expected, I guess","The book itself was in great shape, but there was a price sticker on the back cover. It's not that big of a deal for me, but I would have liked to know it was on there before deciding to buy this one. Not saying it would have changed my mind...but it might have."
2,Rabies.,"Dark dragons are supposed to be treacherous! They're not suppposed to want to help each other! I can hardly recognize Krynn. Maybe that's why there are some five-star reviews.. They don't like Ansalon the way Weis and Hickman wrote it. Almost nothing is accomplished. All the book serves to do is get Feril a garden hose, Blister a medallion, and get Rig and Fiona together. Yuck! Slightly superior to the others in this disgusting series...but still a candidate for book-burning. Amen."
1,Krynn turned two-dimensional.,"Being a long time fan of the Dragonlance series and gamemaster of the Fifth Age game, I felt I had to by Rabe's trilogy (that good old TSR tactic). What a waste of money. The story contains totally uninteresting two-dimensional characters that we care nothing about. It would be bad enough if she had only created her own depth-less characters, but she also drains the very souls of beloved Weis/Hickman characters like Palin and Goldmoon. Palin is reduced to a fireball-hurling NPC. Weis and Hickman must feel raped. Add to these a characters stupid, linear plot (go find magic items around the world before the dragons do), boring descriptive and tonnes of cliches and repeatings and you have the Fifth Age trilogy. DO NOT BY IT! Paradoxically, I recommend Dragonlance fans to stay the farthest from it, because they risk getting a favourite fantasy world ruined like I did."
3,A good book but the ending left me unsatisfied.,All in all this book was decent. Certainly was not one of the best Dragonlance books I have read. Some parts of it kind of dragged along without a whole lot of suspense to the point that I nearly put it down. It ended very blandly without a true and proper conclusion. As this book was the third and last of three books in a set it would have been better to end the whole adventure. Instead Jean Rabe pushes it even further to three more books in which after this one I truthfully am not looking forward to. This is still a good book to read I enjoyed many parts of it though so it is still worth a look.
2,How far Dragonlance has fallen,"I bought Dragons of Summer Flame and the entire 5th Age trilogy thinking that finally the Dragonlance saga was going to move forward. Flame was fairly good, but 5th Age was a huge disappointment. The characters failed to intrigue me. The plot was sometimes nonsensical, like Rabe was forcing the book to go a certain direction without any logical reason for the characters' actions. The climactic battle in Eve of the Maelstrom was absurd. I'm done with Dragonlance until Weis and Hickman's new trilogy comes out."
1,Limit language,I love a go mystery and I love descriptive writing but I do not love the over use in profanity.
2,Good for almost a year...,"This battery worked well for almost a year. The seam separated exposing the innards of the battery. When this happens the battery does not work. It has a 3 year warranty so I am hoping to get a replacement, if I can figure out how to contact the seller."
1,Honestly not very good..,"I like the books. At least the early books, and I'm an avid video gamer so when I saw they had a Left behind game, I decided to give it a whirl. First of all, even though my PC is up to spec, the game has REALLY long load times. The tutorial was beastly, the interface awkward. The units (people), look too similar, and have specific assigned genders (such as no female soldiers, etc.) Halfway through the monstrously long and unweildy tutorial I gave up. The graphics and the clunky iterface just didn't do it for me.I think this series would make a better adventure game... You know with puzzles and traveling to exotic locations (like those produced by DreamCatcher) The LB universe is so interesting it would really shine in that kind of environment. Particularly if characters could visit places such as Jerusalem, New Babylon, and Tribulation force HQ.The one plus to this game was the soundtrack. It was beautiful."
1,Celebrate Christmas by killing people,"The basic premise of this game is that believers roam the New York and kill the unbelievers using Christ sanctioned weapons. The players get to blow areas of the whole city using tanks, kill in the name of the lord and then pray their guilt away and increase their spirits using the special pray button. This game is absurd promotes intolerance and bigotry. If a company in the Middle East / India /China came up with a similar game killing people of other religions who did not convert to Islam / Hinduism / Buddhism, we would all be up in arms with Bill O'Riley, Ann Coulter and Glen Beck decrying the lack of sanity and tolerance in that part of the world. Strangely they seem to have this game their silent nod of approval an example Glen Becks Dec 4 interview with the Jeff Frichner, President, Left Behind Games. Parents should keep their children away from it. If killing is your thrill, I would recommend the World of Warcraft or Half Life as alternatives."
1,OK,"I did order because I was excited to play a game that used prayer over killing. I was surprised and pleased when I discovered that the game also came with the Left Behind book. The game was too much to play. There were endless instructions for every movement in the game. The images were not always clear, at least on my computer, so if I misplaced a person by even a little bit I was stuck. I never go to really play. The whole thing was too much work and memorization of instructions. Even my husband who is a flight sim the more he can learn the better didn't go very far into the game before he gave up.The book on the other hand was a fun read, similar to Stephen King's The Stand. I am actually curious about the best book in the series but I won't be playing the game."
1,"Not for decent human beings, Christian or not.","Amazon should be ashamed to carry such a nasty ""game."" I have to wonder about anyone who thinks slaughtering Jews or atheists is amusing or fun. If you buy this, shame on you. My only problem is the inability to give less than one star."
2,Auto set it is NOT,"i agree with the other 2-star poster: this is NOT an atomic clock. it's OK, i suppose, in that it does keep the analog hands in sync with whatever is on the digital display in the back. but that's not quite what i would call ""auto"".other than a misleading description, it does seem to be a nice, clean, functional wall clock. just not one that will set itself from the time source from radio station WWV in Colorado."
5,excellent and comprehensive,"Focused on technology entrepreneurship, this collection of essays provides a detailed survey of entrepreneurship policy relevant to economic development professionals, govenment officials, and anyone interested in perspectives on the role of policy in supporting entrepreneurial activity. The volume is well edited and the papers make a coherent whole."
2,Iran,This book has Greek bias toward ancient Iranian history. This book is lacking balance view toward ancient Iranian historical figures.
3,Not the greatest dvd but a great finals,"one of the best finals in recent memory. olajuwon is one of the best ever to watch..& unfortunately there isnt much out on dvd that documents his game. so a must to capture his game otherwise, if you dont like the 90s rocket, whats the point?"
1,Poof goes the TV,"Like other reviewers, my TV also went poof after having it about 4 years (guess I should consider myself lucky in getting a bit more time than others). Repair looks to be $700 plus to replace a power switch. I'm very disappointed in this Sony; obviously a poor design. I'm in the market for another TV, not sure it will be a Sony."
5,AWESOME!,I sent this book to my mother who had recently moved to Florida from California. She was able to find many species of birds from her backyard within minutes and lots of interesting information about them too.
2,disappointing,"I just arrived in Florida and tried to find 3 birds I was not familiar with. Only one of three clearly indentified. I went back to the tried and true Golden Book and found two of the three. Gulls are insufficiently covered in the Smithsnian book , particulary as Gulls may not have final markings for 2-4 years. No color illustrations of these. A disappointing book."
1,Preoccupied with the Inquisition,"This is a well researched book with many interesting recipes and historical comments by reputable scholars. I was looking forward to a celebration of the rich interchange between the Jewish, Catholic and Moorish communities of Spain experienced for centuries on end. Jewish consciousness permeates much of Spanish culture from Alfonso El Sabio, to Teresa of Avila etc. That is what I was looking for: something which would be a means of understanding and bridge-building.I am sad to say that beginning with the first sentence on the dust cover there is a fixation on the victimhood of Jews in Spain. Rather than celebrating a wonderful interweaving of cultures the book chose to reinforce age-old prejudices. It is one more example of a centuries old tradition that tars the Christian Spaniards with the brush of persecution and perpetuates the myth of ""Black Spain""."
4,Entertaining and educational,"My 5 year old son likes dinosaurs but he's not ga-ga over them. However, he enjoyed this Pixter cartridge a great deal. The video of dinosaurs was good, and he was absorbed by the detail of dinosaurs life cycles, enough so to inform me that dinosaur eggs were as big as bowling balls and that stegosauruses ate anything. In general the Pixter graphics are cheesy and the capabilities of the device are limited, but my little guy loves it."
5,the DAM Book,"Great book has good info in it, i've even bookmarked certain chapters.He;s using Bridge though, which as we all know is second-best to Lightroom. But Bridge is a browser which Krogh uses, rather than a catalog (save for the iView references).Good though. Recommend."
4,A must for dining in a French restaurant,"Encountered this book in Martinique, provided by therestauranteur; found it invaluable in translating the menu, bothnature of food and methods of preparation. Conveniently carried into a restaurant -- a fascinating read -- wanted to steal it but honesty prevailed. A great gift, too."
3,Not one of CrossGen's best,"As big a fan as I am of CrossGen comics in general, ""The Path"" is not really a book for me. I've never been the biggest fan of Bart Sears' artwork, and at times it becomes quite difficult to tell the characters apart. The pacing is a bit slow, which usually doesn't bother me, but doesn't suit this book as much as it wants to.The big problem with this collection, though, is that ""The Path"" is done entirely in double-page spreads. Instead of reading each left-hand page then each right-hand page, like in most comics, the two pages combine. This is fine in a magazine style comic book, but when the pages are reproduced into a paperback edition like this, the middle of each image get trapped in the crease and makes it difficult to read.It's not a bad book, and it deservedly has its fans. I'm just not one of them."
3,ick ick,"Most of my friends who read this book was incensed. They found the techniques used in the book to be annoying. And I don't think this book will be of much use to me if using will alienate my potential customers. A much better read is Guerrilla PR Wired written by PR guy Michael Levine. It's intelligent and relevant, and is guaranteed not to put off customers."
5,Click and Close right on target,Much has been written about how technology will change the real estate business. This book concentrates on harnessing technology to work for you. The book offeres advice on creating your tech business model and how you can use it to provide better service to clients and to survive for the long haul. Both authors have great insight into the real estate business and are also worth hearing as speakers. A must for the tech savy Realtor.
2,No Ansi SQL,"I don't like this book. This book doesn't use Ansi-92 SQL, instead it uses the SQL language implemented in SQLBase. The second half of the book show how to implement an application in SQL Windows!"
4,Sketching Your Favourite Subjects in Pena and Ink,"I found this book a very useful resource for a pen and ink artist, from beginer to experienced, great illustrations and exercises. Strongly recommended."
5,Good dvd,It is in the dvd that I knew more of who Richard is. He is a man to be praised for. Such a man of God and of integrity.
2,Not for Strong Dogs over 50 pounds,"My 65 pound, 8-month Labrador broke the spring end (manufacturer assembled) of the cable on the THIRD use. The cable end I attached with U-clamps was fine. Unfortunately I could not find the clamps to fix it, so I returned the product. Although the cable may be heavy weight, the cable attachment cannot handle all dogs over 50 lbs as it says on the packaging. I will seek a super heavy weight product, although will first inspect the cable attachments before use."
2,"Good concept, poor quality","The trolley was easy to install. Found the spring to be a little to weak, it was compressed under the weight of the cable. The trolley ran 86 feet between two trees at 7 feet high. Our 50lbs doberman puppy, 7 months old, broke the trolley in less then 20 minutes. She pull the cable out of the lead slug that held the cable at the spring end. I had to cut the cable and fix it with a turn buckle and two U-clamps. The second time she broke the cable at the other end. Yes, I said she broke the cable, it is not pull out like the first time, it broke. I will have to shorten the cable to 77 feet and move it to a different tree to fix it, for the second time. I think it will work, just a lot of trial and error.I would not buy this again, I believe the spring is under sized and the cable broke. The cable issue might have been my fault, but I don't think so. I will update this review if she breaks it a third time. My dog weights under 50lbs and is only 7 months old.Mr. Booth"
4,I wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars,"The book itself is great. My husband and I are often outdoors: hiking, biking, and jogging. This is a great and easy to use reference to identify the flowers we come across. The pictures are nicely organized by flower type and color. The back section has great descriptions about the flowers.The only reason for the imperfect rating is the fact that the book is thick for the glue binding and with very frequent use the pages will come out. Even with that factor I would definitely recommend this book!"
5,Tyler Did It Again Great Cookbook,I highly recomend this cookbook. It has wonderful ethnic recipes and I love the banter by Tyler. It sounds just like him. Gorgeous pictures also. I haven't made anything from this book yet but all the recipes of Tyler's I have made have been something a little extra special. I highly urge you to get this book it you want to try something a little different that will get you rave reviews in the kitchen. The pictures of the recipes in the book made my mouth water. I think I like this cookbook better than the first one. Many of the recipes are a bit different than you see by everyone else but do not sound difficult.
5,quoting Orhan Pamuk on this book,"Orhan Pamuk wrote: ""For a novel I am working on, I studied ... The Houghton Shahnameh (Harvard University Press) in the New York Public Libary, and was astounded and delighted by the writers' eccentric scholarship. By examining and re-examining pictures of countless kings, princesses, soldiers, heroes, servants, horses, camels, rabbits, demons, dragons, birds, balconies, gardens, flowers, trees, leaves,hunters,lions, lovers, dreams and dreamers, Dickson and Welch rebuilt a lost culture and restored a lost history to minute details."""
3,Okay,"This was out of character for a Marco book, but still good in some bits, like when they were pretending to be andalites. But it's not really a memorable animorphs, or a really exciting one. If you want to read a really good book, read #31, the Conspiracy."
5,WONDERFUL,I loved this book. It combines surprise and sentiment - and since it's written by Marco - it also contains humor (and a lot of it too). I would definitely recommend this book to animorphs fans - but it's probably better to read it if you know the history of Marco and Visser One. I have all the animorphs books and I would definitely rank this book very near the top.
4,Oozes youthful energy and passion,"As noted in my review on OperaOnline.us, I thought this album was superb. I wrote: ""This is one of those rare recordings where not a single title is wasted or out of mood or context with the preceding. Netrebko is an exciting soprano whose voice can fill a room and soothe the proverbial savage beast. She is a pleasure to listen to. Her voice oozes youthful energy and passion, while at the same time never being shrill or uneven. Imagine a roller coaster ride on a cushion of air, and that's the journey you take when listening to Anna Netrebko."""
2,"Well, she's pretty..","I find Netrebko to be hyped. The basic voice is lovely and beautifully produced, but her bel-canto technique is not up to the standards set by other, superior singers in this much-recorded repertoire. The fact that her Jewel Song lacks trills or anything resembling them is a turnoff for me. And some of her runs and fiorature are uneasy. She studies with Renata Scotto. Couldn't Scotto have done something to improve her facility in this regard? Mme Marchese's absence is more lamented with each passing year! I did not keep this recording and the frantic advertisements for her second cd (that's not make-up, it's war-paint!!) did nothing to make me want that either. Sorry, I can't recommend. Howard Bushnell"
3,minor complaints,"I've had this Toshiba notebook for a month now, and I haven't had any problems with the pc itself. This computer has the same issue that nearly every new computer has these days--it's loaded with junk software and trials. The main problem I have is that Toshiba will not send me the actual Windows Vista software disk (They only send a recovery disk). So if you run into any issues with Vista (like I did) and want to run XP in a dual-boot, you're out of luck (since it is recommended that XP is loaded first, then Vista, which can't be done without the actual Vista software)."
4,The 1421 heresy,An excellent read considering some of the speculative statements of Menzies book 1421. Although it is somewhat tedious given the extensive referrals of hard to interpret map after map
2,bland vocals - another boring album,"Ok, I like Decapitated, just not on record. Live, they put on a great show and that is what got me into them in the first place. This album just doesnt cut it. There is a new vocalist, and I cant stand it. Gone are the low rumblings from Winds of Creation and other Decapitated releases. The album kinda sounds like The Negation (which bored the hell out of me), but with crappy vocals.Lots of reviewers tend to say ""if you like Behemoth or Cryptopsy, you should check out Decapitated."" Well, Behemoth and Decapitated do have somewhat of a similar sound (kinda like early Vader), but does that mean it's good ? Not really.I honestly cant believe how over-hyped this band and their past two records are. Sure, Decapitated plays some decent death metal, but its nothing that hasnt been done before. The new Suffocation blows this away."
3,"Like Chicago says for Sports, theres always next year (Season)","I do love michael Scott so much. I relate to him so much. His mannerisms the stuff he does the stupid things he does etc. :D its like the writers know me. Every season he gets closer and closer to who i am. and you never know what the writers are going to do! i know this wasnt the best season, but it definitely has its moments. and if you guys want to save, by it at target this week (September 2-8th 2008) for only 29.99! it dodnt cost me a dime except tax because i used a gift card :D anyway Next season will be amazing because we'll get 30 episodes (we lost 8 last season so 8 plus 22 which is an average season is 30!!!! im so pumped september 25th!!! with no stupid interruptions :D so in time get this one to add some of the other seasons company :"
5,Super Funny!,"My husband got these as a gift. He loves them. We loved the price of getting them used off amazon. The office is hilarious, we love it! It's nice having the seasons so we can watch them when we want."
5,"Super Fast Shipping, Item Exactly as Described!","Super Fast Shipping and The Item is Exactly As Described! Brand New, Sealed in the Box! Will Buy From Seller Again in the Future!"
4,Another good season,"First off, I must say that the humor found in The Office series is amazing. The writers and actors capture the awkward situations occurring in every day office life (and then some!) with brilliance. That said, I was slightly disappointed with Season 4. It was still great, and I'd buy it again any day, but a few of the episodes seemed to be missing a little something."
4,In good shape for a used product,"As a fan of The Office, I had to get all the seasons, but of course I didn't want to pay full price. Opting for used turned out pretty well for me. This DVD set had absolutely no scratches and the overall packaging was in good shape. The only issue I had was a broken piece that doesn't allow the DVD to be secured in the holder. So, if I pick it up vertically, one of the disks falls out. But as I said, it's used so I got what I payed for. The price was spectacular."
2,No Mac support,"No Mac support equals poor customer service. iTunes has been successful because of the seamless transaction and viewing process. Until this functionality is fixed for Unbox Video Downloads, business will suffer. I look forward to Amazon raising this service to the service levels and standards of other Amazon product and services.Kennedy"
5,Love for the office,"This season wasn't as great as the first three, but it was still a good season. Hilarious as usual!"
3,4 disks?,"Season 4 was shortened to only 14 episodes, and this box set will still contain four disks? Granted, the first four episodes and the finale are hour-long ""double"" episodes, but still...Oh well, maybe the number of disks indicates that there will be a large amount of special features, and for this show, that's always a great thing!"
1,Possibly worst purchse of my life,"These dumb bells are possibly the worst thing I have ever purchased. After four uses, the rack that holds the weights cracked and about every three uses I have to use duct tape to fix the rack. The warranty is joke. I have had the weights fall from the dumbell during use because the toggle does not stay firmly secured--not very safe. The dumbells do not easily fit into the rack and it is often a hassle to get them to fit. Not exactly hat I want to deal with after doing a set to exhaustion. There is along screw that secures the weights in place and it has broken once. The markings on the weights designate how to set the amount of weight. On the one set of dumbells these markings are backwards. If someone tries to sell you these, run the other way. In my opinion they are poorly constructed and cheaply made."
1,broken screen,"I ordered this MP3 player for my son's birthday. On the day he opened it the screen was cracked so the figure on the screen was distorted. I called Photoworld, from where it was shipped, and the Customer Service agent was extremely helpful. He told me where to send it and I sent it back. I received a replacement yesterday. I am very pleased with this type of service. Thank you!"
2,Flimsy,"I bought this player for the gym and long rides on my motorcycle after losing my iRiver on the road. I really miss the iRiver...it was built like a tank compared to the Sansa c240. The sound quality is decent but I'm on my 3rd unit because the headphone jack wore out on the previous 2 players. I haven't taken the device apart myself because I wanted to be able to RMA it, but it seems like the sauder connection broke and only the right channel will work unless you wiggle the post in the jack. The device was well taken care of in both instances...they just sat in a pocket."
4,Great!,Very Good little MP3 Player. The only bad thing about it is it only actually gives you 953 MB so you will probably going to need a Exspantion Card. Overall it's a GREAT LITTLE MP3 PLAYER. Ipods are better but this is great for the price!
3,great sound good price,"overall good value. had mine for 3 m o. works fine, easy to upload tunes,great great sound, seems rugged enough. very good base line model."
1,Everything is mising !!!,"I ordered one from ANTonline through Amazon.com . The MP3 player arrived on time. When I open the hard plastic, I saw there's empty storage space. I check the item list from online user guide. I figured Earphones,USB Cable, Lanyard and 1 lithium ion battery (a replacement battery??). I called SanDisk but they asked me to contact the online retailer. I called the online retailer and the lady asked me to send an E-mail to their tech support department and wait. Then she HANG UP MY CALL! That's very rude.In general, I believe this is the SanDisk issue because those items were missing in the brand new, sealed hard plastic container. SanDisk is able and capable to prevent this issue. Now they just push the responsibilities to the customer and the online retailer."
1,Horrible!!!!,This mp3 was terrible i return about 5 times and finally i ask for a money back. Dont Buy it!!!!
2,works well until the earphone connection fails,"I got this from a local retailer and was very happy with it, until the connection of the earphones to the player went bad (after about 2 months) and I could only hear out of one of the earplugs (it wasn't the earphones- i tested them on something else). So I exchanged it at the store for the same exact one, and after about 2 months or so happened again! I could fiddle with the jack and have it a little out of the socket and then I could usually hear out of both buds, but that was a hassle and if it got bumped I couldn't hear anything at all.It might be some strange bad luck i have with them, but I decided to change brands."
5,Fantastic!!!,"This second book of the ""Underland Chronicles"" continues the journey of Gregor and his baby sister Boots. Meeting new characters and encountering more tests for all involved. The author weaves a wonderful tale and my son absolutely adores all the characters. I also enjoy reading this series to him, we both become very caught up within the stories and with all the characters...it's hard to put down!"
5,Highly Recommend,"Thought this was a great book, even though I am an adult. Recommend for all ages! Truly enjoyed it as well as the other books in the series."
4,Great Book!,This is an attention grabbing book that reels you in and is difficult to put down. I love the entire series. This is great story for young adults as well as adults young at heart.
1,Maillot Junk,"Buyer beware of this book. It is a US edition of a French book that has been available since 1999. The jacket for the book says it has been updated to include a chapter on Lance Armstrong. Hardly - they added a few mediocre photos. Worse yet, I have found errors in the information provided in the body of the book. The editor may use the excuse that tables have not been updated for the 2001 edition. OK, but there are still errors from the 1999 edition. I had hoped to learn something from this book, but can't trust it. As Groucho once asked, ""How many Frenchmen can't be wrong?"" By purchasing this book (from publisher, not Amazon), I found at least one. C'est la vie? One star for historic photos. Check out Graham Watson if you want current photos. His work is outstanding!"
4,Many choices.,"I bought this kit with my first telescope, so I was naturally obsessed with magnification like most beginners. So yes, it's true that magnification isn't everything, but it is nice to have the option available all in one case. The filters will take me some time to figure out how to use, but once again, at least I have them. The case is well made and has room for extra items like the eyepiece that comes with the scope and even the red-dot spotting scope fits. All in all, a lot of stuff for a reasonable price."
4,Nice Weekend for a Murder,This book is enjoyable and well-written! A great winter afternoon read! I will definitely be looking for more by Max Collins
5,Top notch read!,"I'd never heard of this author but it was recommended at my bookstore because it was awarded a Book Sense Pick. I can easily see why. I loved this story. It has so many elements that fit my taste. It's scary, it's a great mystery - you'd never figure it out. And on top of that, it's laugh-out-loud funny. I highly recommend this novel!!"
5,Cape Cod fun,"I really enjoyed Raw Nerves and I would certainly give it 5 stars. The main character is nicely neurotic, the descriptions of Cape Cod, especially the scenes in the office out by Barnstable Harbor ring true.It is a fun read, on the beach or off, and I kept the light on far too late in the night finishing it. I enjoyed the heroine, Sophie and hope that this is just the first of her appearances. It seems to me that this would make a great series."
2,It's not about France,"""Something to Declare"" is a clever title for a book about travel abroad; but, beyond its opening pages, that's not what this book is about. ""Essays on France"" is an equally misleading subtitle, for the book's erudite essays (beyond the opening chapter) are not on France but on a narrow selection of French writers and related movers and shakers, and one fictional character: Madame Bovary. After a fast-paced, dazzling opening sequence, hilariously describing the teen-aged Barnes' first encounters across the English Channel, we slow down to pick through some highlights in the lives of some of the top French authors, poets, filmmakers and other cultural icons, eventually easing to a crawl through exhaustive detail regarding the author's main interest, Flaubert and his world. If Madame Bovary is your cup of tea, you may enjoy steeping yourself further in Barnes. For me it was just too much."
2,"Not Sharp, won't stay sharp.","I have used and liked other Tweezerman products, so I took a chance in these for my sister who does embroidery. We found the end 3rd of the blades were too dull to cut thread cleanly. I used my Spyderco Sharpmaker to sharpen them, but found they were dull again after a few dozen cuts. These scissors sharpen really fast, which is likely why they go dull so fast. Other scissors I have sharpened took more work but have held their edge just fine. So if you want embroidery scissors, look elsewhere."
2,"Multiple sets owned, all failed catastrophically.","I have had two sets of these and they have both failed catastrophically. The first set I had the skewer itself snapped; I thought it could be that I was over-torquing it, so I bought another set. This time I was quite careful not to overtighten (aiming for 1/8 turn past fingertight), but the nut stripped out after about 6 months and just 3-4 loosening/tightenings. Bulldust!Recommend against."
1,Utterly Bizzare,Strange and off putting in the amount of confusion it causes the reader. If you make it through the beginning it picks up a bit in the middle as you start to think perhaps you might know what's going on. On the whole though it isn't something I'd recommend in the slightest.
4,Outstanding modern performances,"Few contemporary violinists have championed the Busoni sonatas or concerto; the historical recordings by Szigeti have not only set the standard but with few exceptions, have kept these works alive for the record collector.Having heard the much-missed Pina Carmirelli perform the Second Sonata at Marlboro in the 1960s, and hearing Sergiu Luca's fine recording I didn't think there would be room for another contemporary version but this CD amply fills that space; while the Second Sonata, with its amazing fusion of Bach and late Beethoven dwarfs the First, it is still good to have the earlier work. Exemplary performances of both, if lacking in the personal identification both Szigeti and Carmirelli brought to this music; proving however that Busoni, often regarded as an also-ran, was in fact a supremely gifted and powerful contemporary of Mahler and Richard Strauss and that his music admits performance by those not in the master's immediate line of descent."
4,"YO CANTO, great song","I am a Pausini fan since she sang La Solitudine and was heard in many continents. This album, is different, a compilation of italian writers and singers so it is not her own composition but her own way of singing them. The strongest song in the album is YO CANTO. I had only heard it after I bought the cd and it was very impressive, strong vocals as usual, soft, no more loud screams, it all comes out naturally for Laura now since her last two albums, LO MEJOR DE...LAURA PAUSINI in 2000 and ESCUCHA en 2005. Escucha was definitely a success for Laura, she won the Grammy, composed the songs at a difficult period in her life, so she puts all her emotions, anger, and hope into the cd. For me, the strong tracks on YO CANTO is this same song, Dos, and Estrella Gemela, who Eros Ramazzotti has a great version of it long before but Laura gives it a new smooth spin which is very nice to listen to. Melancholic.Enjoy it.Laura always gives her best."
3,Fun Pulpy Read,"To the other reviewers: Yes, the original Howard books were fantasic (we all know this), but some of the books written afterwards have been exciting too(mostly the Robert Jordan ones). I'm happy authors have kept this character alive after all these years, the books are just fun pulpy reads for me. How about reviewing some of this book though? The Spider God (actually one of the better books) and the Liberator (sokay) are both in this book and I have them as stand alone novels. If you can get the book for under $5 (with shipping) it should a fun read and that is all that matters."
3,Family Help? Not so much . . .,"If you are looking for a book that helps to confirm a diagnosis, this is a great resource, and it did convince me that my adopted son's diagnosis is accurate, but did not offer a tremendous amount of advice for me.I took exception to statement on page 130, ""Many psychiatrists, myself included, [don't recommend inpatient care because] antisocials are a nuisance on inpatient units."" What a ridiculous reason to refuse care! If he cannot handle antisocials with the support of a full nursing staff, how on earth should the family deal with them 24/7/365? He went on to describe a troublemaker saying, ""all who worked with him were relieved when he left."" They felt sorry for themselves because they had to deal with him, what, 8 hours a day? Really? I deal with the effects of ASP every waking AND sleepless hour!Again, the book is a helpful descriptor of conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder, but not a source of healing."
5,True Classic,This is real nestalgic. A perfect conversation thing to throw in and talk with old friends and family about the days this music was popular...BUT STILL ROCKING!!!
4,Great item and excellent value these days,"I have had this system for about two years. It has worked flawlessly over that time. The sound is top notch for a 2.1 system. I also checked out the Bose 321 while shopping for this and found the Kef to be superior in sound, and build quality. I highly recommend this unit.My only gripe is that it could use a few more inputs. It only has one toslink which ends up being kind of a pain, but I guess that is common for 2.1 theaters. If you can get your hands on one of these then I highly recommend it. Most likely you'll have to get one used or on clearance since it has been replaced by a newer model. I am guessing that you can find a deal on this nowadays and it will be well worth it."
4,"The Ear, the Eye, and the Arm","This is an exciting and adventurousbook. It takes place in 2194. It is about three children (Tendai, Rita, and Kuda) that escape from their house to gain a Boy Scout Badge, but who wnet througha lot of trouble and moving from one place to another. There are three detectives (Ear, Eye, and Arm) helping the Matiskas' to find their only three beloved children. Do you think they will ever go home?"
2,The Eye The Ear and The Arm,"I didn't find the book intersting. I thought it was boring , but the end was not bad."
2,Tottally boring,"I have to read this book for reading at school. I find ""The Ear, the Eye and the Arm"" tottally uninteresting and boring. The plot is entirely over used and it seems like the author is trying to give a history & social studies lesson, more than trying to entertain. I have given it 2 stars, only because it has it's vaguely amusing parts. I am not saying that you shouldn't read this book, for I see others enjoy it well, I'm just saying it's just...boring to me."
4,Great good fun,"I have become a big fan of Nancy Farmer. I have liked every one of her books that I have read. This one is great fun and a really interesting look at people in a different culture. I notice that most of the other reviewers of this book are kids; I'm 50 and I loved it. When I was a kid, I read a lot of books set in England and became very familiar with the history and culture of that place. This book gives me a similar feeling about a very different setting - Africa."
2,it's OK,"If you like science fiction and fanticy read this book. For myself I enjoyed this book at the beggining, but in the middle and at the end it wasn't good at all. I read it in english and every page I read it got more boring. I thought I would like this book because it had science ficton in it, it had science fiction but it was to exaggerated.in 2146 I dont think technolagy will be that good and crimminals will be that bad. It is a two star because it was really quit boring."
4,"The Ear, The Eye, and The Arm","How does Matsika feel whithout his children? His children went on a scout Adventure trip; it was supposed to last a few days but it lasted a few weeks. They were first kidnapped by the She Elephant. The She Elephant was going to sell them to a gang called the Masks. It was the only gang in town. They ran away from the She Elephant following Trashman, his mind is like a four year old Child. Kuda whi is the youngest brother is on his back. Tendai is the oldest and Rita is the middle sister. The three detectivesare looking for the kids. The three siblings leab the Dead mans vlie and go to Resthaven.. After they are kicked out they go to Mrs Horsepool. Who is the Mellewors mom. The mellower is the praise singer in the story. THey are back on the hands of the She Elephant, and will they be sold to the Masks. I thought this was boring at the begining but not at the end."
2,didnt meet needs,"This adapter is advertised as a 300mbs adapter. but its just outdated and doesnt perform the way its supposed to.either get a newer pcie adapter or get a wireless range extender, this adapter has seen better days."
1,Avoid at all costs,"Junk. I purchased this and it worked good for about a month. Then it started to have problems maintaining its original connectivity. It just kept slowing down, until yesterday when it just totally died. It couldnt hold a connection for more then 5 min and if it did I would only download at about 20 k/b. I yanked that piece of junk out and replaced it with a ASUS usb wireless and out of the box is far better then the old Dlink."
3,"Not great, but works.","Signal reception is somewhat weaker than the PCI-E equivalent (DWA-556) which is excellent to my experience, but it does function and can be used. I would have got the other one, except that it is a little inconvenient to use that on my ASRock 990FX Extreme4 motherboard, as there are only 2 PCI-E X1 slots, both around the 1st PCI-E x16 slot, and one is actually covered by the Sapphire 6870 graphics card, the other position is encroached by the northbridge heat pipe.D-Link DWA-556 Xtreme N PCI Express Desktop AdapterASRock MB-990EX4 Socket AM3+/ AMD 990FX/ AMD Quad CrossFireX& nVidia Quad SLI/ SATA3&USB3.0;/ A&GbE;/ ATX MotherboardSAPPHIRE AMD Radeon HD 6870 1GB GDDR5 PCIE Graphics Card"
3,Not What I Expected,"A few years ago D-Link was a very good company but now I bought to routers from them this year and they were both bad and did not do what they were supposed to do. This is just another one of those products..... With 3 antennas and being an extreme N I though it would receive a much better signal when paired up with my Netgear N750 Wireless Router. Although the router is in another room next to mine I only get 20% signal with it. I bought a very long 9Dbi ASUS antenna and connected it to it and now I get about 70%. Another thing that is very bad about this adapter is that it does not receive 5Ghz signals. If you want a fast wireless N adapter for Gaming and file sharing I would not recommend this adapter, because it is not dual band and does not have a good range!!!!!!!!"
2,bad range,"No need to say much. I compared DWA-160 with DWA-160, DWA-552, and WUSB300N. The result is DWA-160 > WUSB300N > DWA-140 > DWA-552. DWA-552 is even advertising it has better range than dwa-140. DWA-552 only saw 1/5 of list that other adapters could see. And it is asking for big money. what a shame."
1,Not Worth It,Product is N capable however will not work with dir-825 router which is an N router rendering the adapter completely useless. Tech support said I had to by a better card in order to get the 5ghz bandwidth frequency that the router provide. Not happy with their tech support and the backing of their products. LINKSYS has not failed me ever.
1,Not a long lasting product,Installation went fine and worked great....for two months and then it just stopped working. Had to do a quick replacement so I got a usb type adapter.
2,Not very impressed with this product. It's seting in a drawer now.,We did not have a lot of success with this product. USB devices worked better. As I recall we had some setup problems and well and it's still setting in a drawer in a desk someplace. Would not buy again.
4,Reveals many connections with key 20th Century literary icons,"Sometimes when one reads a book of over 500 pages it turns out a lot of the content isn't that interesting after all. I enjoyed this treatment of the Sitwells both to find out more about them but also to see how so many other writers, composers, and artists fitted into the first few decades of the 20th Century. Lots of the people brought into the story I knew a little bit about, but this book really helped group them together in a more meaningful way. The author writes well, it doesn't get boring. About the only criticism I have is that the word ""facade"" shows up too many times. Edith Sitwell and her brothers put together a performance of poetry and music with this title, and I think the author let himself get carried away with use of the word. You do notice it jumping off the page, but it's a minor criticism of a good book. I'm glad I read it, and the price was right because I got an excellent used copy right here at Amazon."
4,"good product, excellent service",The product arrived in a reasonable time and it was exactly as advertised. I was especially pleased by the packaging since it makes it very easy to feed.
5,Leadership: The Journey Inward is a must read!,"This elegant little book invites each of us to tap our inner leader to create the outcomes we want in our work and in our lives. The author suggests that leadership development is primarily about attending to the lessons of our hardships and pivotal life experiences, gleaning the wisdom from these and having the courage to apply this wisdom in the everyday business of managing and leading self and others. Ambrose offers many tips and examples from the lives of recognized leaders, along with occasional worksheets for self-reflection."
4,Rather eclectic for a pioneer,"It appears that the author's important contribution to underground comics was a response to the times, rather than a life commitment like those of Anais Nin and S. Clay Wilson. I know that is all one can expect, but I have been spoiled by what I have been reading recently. More power to her that she could contribute so much without even becoming commited.This is a very good book. It is essential to anyone who wants to know about the history of comics, and perhaps also records the development of American culture."
1,white man using,"This book is representative of all the ""wise indian"" books written. The largest fraud it perpetuates is that it proposes to be different. I started reading it with an open mind, but when I got to the comment about prairie dogs making the grass better, I knew for certain that which I had been suspecting: It is just baloney. Don't bother buying this one, just pick up any ""wise indian"" book to get your fill."
1,Pan-Indianism or Meatless Pemmican,"Ken Nerburn's Neither Wolf Nor Dog perpetuates Pan-Indian images and at the same attempts to reinforce Pan-Indianism in the misinformed Euroamerican mainstream mind. He is quite successful with his task due to the fact that most of his readers are preconditioned with the idea that all Indians are one homogenous culture. He misunderstands, as he hopes his readers do, that multitudes of dynamic and unique cultures existed and continue to exist despite the cultural power of Pan-Indainism. Nerburn like many other Pan-Indian authors, many of them tribal memebers themselves, takes advantage of the misinformed public to peddle his fiction as fact. If you, as a reader who seeks the truth rather than mere entertainment, really can believe that this book is a meeting between Jack Kerouac and Black Elk Speaks then you have a lot to learn about the two of them. And so does Mr. Nerburn."
2,WITHER READING ?,"Yup, that's right. Reading is withering, you can see it vanishing: just open this book. Rainy's effort here should have been called ""Interpretation: Gone in 60 Seconds"", Or perhaps ""Rainy's Recipe for Instant Water: Just add Water."" Rainy's tome here is pretty diluted. Rainy never risks himself by reading anything, doesn't really offer an engagement with the great texts of Joyce or Eliot or anyone for that matter. He just washes over them in a conventionally historical fashion, as if he were giving them an institutional bath. Speaking of which, when I accidentally dropped Institutions of Modernism into my tub, it actually shrunk! It went through the draincatcher and left a nasty ring."
3,"Before the Clan novels, there was the Curse!","I became interested in reading the Trilogy of the Blood Curse after reading the Clan Novel series. This first book, centering around the elder Ventrue, Owain, starts off a bit slow but ends with a flourish.Everything takes place in Atlanta, where we get to see our old friends Benison, Hanna, Benjamin, Thelonius, and others before the Clan novel series. Owain, though not directly involved in the local politics, does carry some weight around with his experience. When the Blood Curse hits, Owain is torn between his duties to the local Prince, and his own personal feelings. In the end, the world begins to crumble around Owain as he discovers old emotions, long buried in his cold dead heart.The novel jumps around quite a bit between other vampires and other cities, this to give the reader the impression of how far the Blood Curse is spread. A few of the other stories begin to weave into the main story towards the end. Overall, a good read."
3,The Devil's Advocate represents an advance in RPG fiction,"In his suprisingly well-written work, Fleming takes the basic ingredients of White Wolf Gaming Studios Vampire: the Masquerade, some good historical research on the social and political organization of Wales between the Norman Conquest of England and the death of Llewellyn II, and the intriguing character of the protagonist, Ventrue elder Owain ap Iuean (a.k.a. Owain Evans) to create a work which pushes the boundaries of the ""save the world in three easy steps"" RPG based fiction. Though the shifts in character and scene occasionally distract from, rather than adding to the exploration of the character and past of Owain Evans, the writer shows some talent for sketching a character with something more than two dimensions. If the author can resist pressure to ""commit trilogy"" with his future works, he has the potential to be a writer whose books will be the sort to look for."
5,Cannot go wrong with this; B&S brand; Good value,"It is oil after all and for the kind of use it gets (lawn mowers etc.), it is hard to debate on the quality. I was hesitant to buy the larger pack (48 oz) but figured that my lawn mower and pressure washer could both use the same. The price works out cheaper than if you would buy individual, although not a whole lot. Convenience is a big thing. Overall good experience and will buy again."
1,"Good idea, bad implementation","This is a far cry from KA's best work. The first two books in this series (Gamearth and Gameplay) are downright bad. The third shows definite improvement in his writing ability, but overall, the series probably isn't worth your time, unless you're a complete D&D addict."
5,Excellent!,"A great book in a beautiful series devoted not so much to teach Classical Chinese, but rather to assist the reader in deepest, not trivial interpretation paths... And also a better method to understand the distinctive way to reason of ancient mankind."
4,Deja Vous all over again!,"I totally agree with Michael Richman's earlier comments. These are important,perhaps, definitive recordings of Rachmaninov's mighty piano concerti, but how many reissues, in how many different guises do they warrant? I don't believe this ""Trio"" release (although an excellent value) is even remastered, ADRM or otherwise. Another example of the sad state of the serious music recording scene here and abroad. Thank God for Naxos & its vision, repertoire, and increasingly excellent roster of artists!"
1,Not Superstrong,"While these magnets are superstrong when connected to each other, they hold only two pieces of paper to six layers of magnetic paint -- superexpensive, superovercharged for shipping, & superlate getting to me - ordered 9/5 - guaranteed to be here 9/27 (ridiculous) & didn't even arrive until 9/30 . . . will not order from this vendor again."
1,Marketing Weenies Truimph over Design Functionality,"I can just hear the marketing weenies when this product was designed: ""We need to make a charger that is different than the other ones on the market. Ooh and one that extends our brand!"" The marketing weenies then proceeded to make ""different"" = ""worse"".What's wrong with this charger? The bulbous plastic casing that surrounds the AC plug is so large that it blocks use of adjacent outlets.Using the charger on a powerstrip blocks the outlets ON BOTH SIDES of it. Hotel use is difficult or impossible because the big plastic case either doesn't fit or can't plug all the way in to the outlets often found at the base of a lamp or on a dedicated outlet for your computer or cell phone.Case Logic product folks, did you ever try plugging this charger in to an outlet during development?Don't buy this unit."
2,i dont get it...,"I didn't apply to ivey but I wanted a highly reviewed read, honeslty I don't see the hype. These books all read simular, but some how people have to stay afloat so I don't feel bad buying it, it wasn't useless, but it wasn't needed.. I wish ivey was greener and didn't pollute air land and sea with textbooks that don't fix my computer or my electricity... it dosnt talk enough about how the system is lingustically kept in place.. iam personally writing my own book to explain the beyond superficial explaination of a structure... considering we have acting, we have LA... and were ment to go Awww.. and its called law... a lot more needs to be explained to a legal degree...If you buy it just resell.."
1,How the heck did you stumble across this?,"Chicken Fat? Um, ok. This travesty disappoints on all levels. Stay away from this and pick up anything that Arnold does for kids in terms of phys ed. It's far superior."
4,Honest and Funny,"I really should have waited until after I was pregnant to read this book. This book is brutally, terrifyingly honest. I had no idea about all these crazy things that happen when you are pregnant, give birth, and have a newborn. Anyway, a friend of mine is expecting, so I thought I'd give it a whirl. This book has a candid, humorous way of giving pregnancy tips and discrediting myth and superstition, and outside of my overwhelming fear of reproduction now, I enjoyed it. If you're pregnant, definitely read it."
4,A good way to keep your sense of humor!!,"I feel that this book gave me a good view of how humorous the human body can be during pregnancy. Reading some of the situations made me feel better about what I was feeling and that it was normal to feel a little crazy at times. Don't loose your sense of humor with the experience and pamper yourself now by reading a book like this. If you want medical advice, get a medical book. It doesn't take a genius to figure that one out! I really enjoyed loosing myself in this book and getting some tidbits of info that i'm sure will be helpful... if you're not sure, read the excerpt. that's why it's there! ;)"
5,"It's called the ""Girlfriends Guide"" for a reason...","I don't care what the other reviewers had to say but the basis of this book was not to talk about medical terminology, infertility, or breastfeeding. It is meant to give a ""Girlfriends"" perspective on what it is like being pregnant.I loved every page of this book and can't wait to pass it on!!"
1,Over rated,"I received this book as a shower gift and found a lot of the information to be outdated. It was written in 1995, so when Ms. Iovine was actually pregnant it was the late 80's and early 90's - 10 Years ago! A lot has changed. I found great pregnancy clothes, did not feel the world owed me a thing for being pregnant, and found solid advice (which I was seeking) in other books. (The Baby Whisperer Book, Sweet Child of Mine, Baby Bargains, Mayo Clinic Guide to Pregnancy, etc) Also, my child was in intensive care due to a birth defect and this book did not offer any practical advice on that subject. If you want a tongue in cheek book for laughs this is o.k., other than that read someone else's, check it out of the library, or buy it used.Not worth the money for a new copy."
1,Just another opinion....,"I bought this during my second pregnancy, and feeling cheated out of real advice, ended up purchasing a couple other non-opinionated pregnancy books. The author skits around from all the different stages of pregnancy making jokes here and there, being sarcastic, and giving her personal opinion on everything. She shares what happened to her, or her friends during their pregnancies, but EVERY pregnancy is different. It's best not to go off the advice of someone other than a doctor. You just never know what to expect, and this book would leave a new mom confused and lost. If you want to know what happened during your friends pregnancy, great, ask them, but DONT expect any of it to apply to your pregnancy. This book is a huge waste of money. I'm sorry I ever bought it."
1,Not a Guide for a Good Friend,"My wife was given this book early in her pregnancy. I know many reviewers say that you need to have a sense of humor to appreciate this book, but this book was not that funny and did nothing to ""guide"" us through our pregnancy. All it did was scare my wife by talking about all the bad things about being pregnant. This is a good book to read if you don't want to get pregnant or are jealous of those that are."
2,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!,"I purchased this book based on some very favorable reviews on this website and because I'd heard this book was sooooo funny! Well, it was insulting to me!I'm not pregnant yet... But, while we're waiting, I'm reading everything I can about pregnancy and childbirth.I was sooo excited when I bought this book! I just knew I was in for a treat! Well, I quickly determined that I'd just wasted [my money]. Not one to abandon a book...I read all the way up to chapter 5. Then, I just couldn't read another page. It was insulting to read her ""professional"" opinions. I wish I'd borrowed this one from someone! I sure would love my [money] back!!!"
1,Don't waste your time,"I got this book from a friend, who is also pregnant, same time as me, and really wanted to enjoy it...after reading all the ""standard"" pregnancy books, I was looking forward to a good laugh and different information.The author's views are very personal and honest...but it left me feeling agitated, let down, and angry at all the negativity in this book. Not a lot of useful information, and the tone is more of a gripe session about pregnancy, and all the ""horrible"" things that go along with it...in her opinion. It was somewhat depressing, and not enlightening or helpful or at all. Totally unsupportive of anyone wanting to do natural childbirth, and no ""celebrating"" the beauty and wonder of pregnancy...if you're just looking for something to read, that may give you a few laughs, and you can get into the mind set of not taking anything in this book seriously, then give it a try...it was just too much of a waste for me."
4,Fun and Flippant,"I thought this was so much fun and so helpful to get me through those beginning months when you feels so overloaded with information. This is not a medical book, but if you like having a girlfriend who is opinionated and speaks her mind and know how to differentiate it from someone telling you what to do, you'll love this book."
4,"Opinionated, but some good information!","The Girlfriends Guide really does have a lot of useful information that is not really talked about in the other pregnancy books. Most of those other books speak more scientifically, that's true, and this is more anecdotal, but it does help to know that others have felt how you do, and experienced some of your symptoms. It makes you feel like your symptoms are ok, and what you're going through is normal. And it covers things you may not want to ask your doctor, or your mother, or your girlfriends. My only complaint is that there are some very strong opinions expressed that are not my own, but I'm a very strongly opinionated woman myself, so I can't fault the author. This is still a very helpful book. However, if you're looking for a book on fetal development, this is not the book for you."
5,Said it all.....,"This book completly said it all. As first timer, I found this book to be very reassuring. Everything in the book was so true! Even now when I go back and look through it, I can't believe how everything pretty much went as she stated. I also loved her sense of humor in the book. That made it fun to read. Definatly a great book for anyone who's pregnant for the first time."
5,I'm SO glad I read this book!,"I found this book to be hilarious! I have two pregnancy books written by doctors that give me the ""medical"" facts, but this book was just what I needed for how I was feeling emotionally. It was also a relief to read that there are other women out there who feel like me regarding epidurals and such. It seems that the ""all-natural"" moms out there are ready to beat up on those of us who don't believe in pain, and it was refreshing to read a similar point of view for a change!"
2,good husbands do exist but not in this book,although the book contains useful information i was appalled and upset to read how poorly husbands are portrayed. the entire book seems to constantly draw the line between men and women pregnant or not. always describing the concerned husband as if there were something wrong with them.as if the pregnancy could not possibly mean as much to them as to the mother.her own husband sounds like a real piece of work.she seems to think no more of producing another baby than wiping her nose.fact is that many husbands are not at all like hers.hers sounds more like a child than an adult.i guess she really likes children around her.
1,Not that great!,I didn't find it funny or informative. The only useful thing was the checklist of what to buy for the baby. You can find that in many other books.
2,Funny - But Too Negative,"If this woman had such a hard time with pregnancy, why did she have so many kids? I just had a baby, and have many friends with babies, and none of us had the plethora of problems she seems to have had. Some of the advice is just bad - like exercise doesn't help you have a healthier pregnancy and labor. I don't know any doctor who would agree with that. The book definitely has some funny moments, so read it for the humor if you want. Just don't rely on it for advice or let it give you a negative view of pregnancy."
2,"Overrated, not encouraging","Although occasionally funny (especially towards the beginning), and initially readable with its engaging approach, the Girlfriends' Guide ends up being a discouraging discourse into all the downsides of pregnancy. Ms. Iovine especially spends a lot of time discussing getting fat during the course of the pregnancy and on getting rid of the fat afterwards. Get it out from the library if you must but don't waste your money."
1,I am just appalled that anybody likes this book,"This has got to be one of the most unfunny books I have ever read. I am just appalled to think that there are women out there who are actually taking this advice. The utter disrespect this woman expresses for her family and herself is astounding. If this somehow represents a recognizable American family experience, even as a satire, all I can say is there is something dreadfully wrong in a lot of people's lives."
2,Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancy,"I purchased this book after I read What to expect while your expecting.I thought that this book had more opinions than facts. It's an interesting point of view, it's a good alternative book."
3,The humorous side,"I just finished reading this book -- which I didn't buy based on what I read of other people's reviews. I found it amusing (some things more than others) and it certainly did point out some of the more grisly aspects of pregnancy and delivery that my other books skipped -- and frankly, I would rather know what MIGHT happen than be surprised and horrified if it does and I wasn't expecting it! Also, it can be reassuring to see that all those peculiar thoughts and worries that have been floating around in your brain are perfectly normal. If you have a limited budget for purchasing books for your ""pregnancy education"" this probably isn't a wise choice, but if you can borrow it from a ""girlfriend"" or a library, it is worth a read."
5,The Only Book You Need!,"This is the best of the crop of ""expecting"" books. It covers all the bases, and it's VERY funny. Unlike some others, it's never preachy or sappy, and it's superbly practical. If you only read one book, this is the one you must get!"
4,Too Funny...,"This is a great break from the really serious pregnancy books. You still need those, but this book had me rolling on the floor! It is too funny. I will now be buying the Girlfriends' Guide to Surviving the First Year."
2,Girlfriend's Guide from a Nurse Midwife's viewpoint,"I am a Nurse Midwife and I read this book to see if it is one I would recommend to my patients. While I love the idea of a book written by a non-medical person, the information in this book is sometimes so erroneous that I would never recommend it and in fact am tempted to destroy my copy to make sure it never gets into circulation. I like Vicki Iovine's humorous style and it is enjoyable to read. I also like that it gives the non-medical point of view, but so much of the information is wrong that I worry it could be somewhat harmful if this were the only pregnancy book an expectant mother read. If taken in the context of knowing that most of the medical information is probably wrong, and preferably read along with books written by more reliable authors, it can be a fun read."
5,"Wonderful ""tell it like it is"" guide","After picking up and buying every book on pregnancy that i could find. I found this one. The girlfriends guide is not the medical and ""stage"" driven kind of guide that most other pregnancy books are. It tells you all the stuff that even your Gyn won't readily discuss with you. It kept me laughing when i was too tired to do anything else. However, because this book speaks to you like a girlfriend it is best used in conjunction with a fab regular pregnancy guide so that you get all the medical facts as well. The asolute best I found was The Pregnancy Bible by Joanne Stone."
4,Very Funny,"I did think that this book was extremely hilarious and for a lot of us, including myself, we can really relate to her. Obviously for some of you pregnancy was wonderful and had very little discomforts along the way. For those that can relate I think it's a great book and I would recommend it to my newly pregnant friends because MOST women do have at least some of the complaints she mentions."
4,Good advise on the non-medical aspects of pregnancy,I loved this book. Especially the part on pregnancy insanity. It made me feel like I wasn't a freak to be feeling so emotional all of the time. The advise on maternity clothes is invaluable
4,Reassuring and entertaining at the same time,"I thought Vicky's book was very insiteful and candid. I like her humor and her realistic suggestions. I, like other reviewers, only did not like the section on exercise. She states (and seems to imply for others) that she only works out to look good or lose weight. For those of us who will never be a size 4 but just enjoy exercise for the physical and mental release, I would differ on her opinions of exercise at such a mentally trying time anyway. Other than that I found the book easy to read and funny. She makes it okay to laugh at yourself during this time of many changes."
2,Take it with a grain of salt.,"What you have to remember is that this is one (or three) women's personal opinion. I listened to it on tape and enjoyed some parts for their entertainment value. I did learn some valuable thing like what to pack for the hospital. The section on epidurals completely precluded not having one which is a valid ""and safe"" choice for both mother and child. The section on exercise during pregnancy was nonsense - every woman should stay active and exercise if possible during pregnancy. This is a book to be taken lightly, not seriously."
1,"Kind of Cute, but I am now really turned off to pregnancy!","I am not yet pregnant, but doing research to see what all is involved. I am looking forward to pregnancy as a fabulous time and miracle of life. This book sounded like it was so much torture and I was going to be fat and hideous forever and ""morph into a hippo"". Well, what made me so mad was reading on the back cover that she was a Playboy model. How can she speak for every woman when she is exactly NOT what I want to be? I've gained and lost weight, had bad skin, and low self esteem. I already have a few stretch marks and god forbid, weight over 150lbs. Guess what- there are WORSE things that can happen besides gaining weight ESPECIALLY when you are growing a baby. I also feel very strongly that breastfeeding, staying at home and natural childbirth are very important, but Vicki tells me a bottle, fulltime daycare and a scheduled C-section are just as good. I don't believe her."
1,Vicki Iovine needs to fire her editor!,"This book was a real disappointment. After reading the raving reviews I thought I had found a wonderfully helpful book on the""inside scoop of pregnancy"". I am sorry to say that it did not come close to living up to my expectations. Not only is The Girlfriends' Guide poorly written, but there are mistakes riddled throughout the book such as taking an antihistimine for dry skin! I felt that this was a highly opinionated book that lacked in research and wit."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,The author criticizes anyone who made different choices than her even though she clearly has no real education regarding birth and evidence based care. She feels like getting a bunch of unecessary tests that may harm her unborn child is a good thing. I think she needs attention or has other unresolved issues. She's not my girlfriend.
3,"Not terrible, not great.","I bought this book when I was 2 months pregnant. It has its good points and its bad. It definately is funny, that's for sure. It also provides some good advice on preparing for the hospital stay and what to take with you, etc. Other than that, this book was not that great. I read the entire thing and YES, the author is quite opposed to exercise during pregnancy. NOT JUST WEIGHT-LIFTING! She has a top ten list on why not to exercise! Maybe the last reviewer is the one that needs to read the whole book. In addition I got the impression that the author is also not into breasfeeding at all. All in all, I was dissapointed in it."
1,Not for the First Time Mom To Be,"I would definitely not recommend this book for a first time Mom. I read this before I got pregnant and ended up in tears. I have a great self image, but by the time I finished this book, I was sure that I would end up fat, lumpy and unlovable. I was sure that my husband would never want to touch me again. I have told all of my friends who are trying to conceive to leave this one on the shelf!"
2,the reality of pregnancy,"I have bought tons of books on pregnancy since I found out I too had becaome part of the club. This is the only book I really enjoyed reading. It is filled with real advice on practically anything you can think of having to do with pregnancy. I finished it very quickly and I was very thankful for the book when I had a small emergency during my pregnancy that had been covered by the author. I recomend this to anyone who is pregnant and find it a relief from the other books that tell us pregnant women that we can cheat on our diets once a week and have a bagel or some bread. Thank you Vicki and all the girlfriends for calming my fears, making me laugh and shedding some light on much needed information."
1,"I would've burned it, but it wasn't my copy.","Really. Though some have found this book immensly helpful, I found the author/narator's obsession with her physical appearance grating. The advice to forget about excercise because you'll get fat anyway was ludicrous. Also, as an admittedly biased first time mom who gave birth at home with midwives in attendance, I didn't really get anything out of the 'trust you doctor' vibe."
2,"A fluffy read, but not a lot to learn here","This falls under the entertainment and not pregnancy/childbirth education heading. The book focuses on the author's experiences and is unabashedly biased. It's a good background on what to expect with regards to symptoms, tests, etc.. It's also rather funny in some parts; however, I don't beleive the author ever intended for this to be a medical reference (although it's very medical-focused). Buy it used, there are tons of copies out there. Don't use it as a reference when making your decisions."
1,If I could give it 0 stars I would.,"This book was a bore! I read lot of books during my pregnancy and this one was THE WORST! The ""Girlfriend"" who wrote it is full of herself and not every pregnant woman wants to be pregnant with a nasty attitude! I threw my copy away! Go get What To Expect When You Are Expecting. At least it is full of educated opinions and fact. This woman wrote about things she obiously had no real information on. This book is all opinion and no fact! If you read through What To Expect as quickly as I did you will need a book for the second half of your pregnancy... go get What To Expect From The First Year and What To Expect From the Todddler Years. Like in school it is always good to read the chapter before hand.. so go for it!"
1,An expectant dad's perspective,"I'm fully aware that as a expectant dad, I'm not in the ""girlfriends"" club this book is aimed at; however, I've read all the ""What to expect..."" type books that my wife has bought or have been given to us, and this was the worst of the lot and the only one I actually found offensive. I thought it might give some insight into what my wife is going through, but instead it told me that I'm an insensitive clod who doesn't really care what she's going through. And that men are just lying when they compliment their wives' changing bodies (not true!) among other absurd stereotypes. This book is a great way to plant the seeds of doubt in a pregngant women's mind and create division between expectant parents. If that's what you want, go for it."
2,Not what I expected!,I bought this book thinking it would be fun. I was hoping it would ease some of my fears and tensions but it did the exact opposite. It scared me! Some of it is funny-but she really focuses on some mediocre stuff that most likely the majority of us wouldn't even worry about. I felt depressed after I read it-then I realized it was just a book and I am not going to let one lousy book get me upset.
4,Loved It!,"Girlfriends unite! This is the one pregnancy book that I could get through without worrying if my baby is going to come out with two heads or not at all. Iovine's blunt talk about being pregnant and having a baby is quite a relief from other pregnancy books. While I wouldn't take all the information to heart - some of it is dated, even for the mid-90's - it was a fun, relazing read in the cesspool of pregnancy books. Again, I wouldn't follow some of the advise - drinking a glass of wine, borrowing old furniture, etc. read it as a way to smile through all the changes that are happening. Then make your husband read it - he'll wonder what's so funny anyway."
4,good book!,"I really enjoyed this book. Iovine gives all of the information we need but are afraid or embarassed to ask, with a sense of humor. This book is geared to the married pregnant woman, so if that is not you a lot of the information will be irrevelant. She also strongly advocates the use of drugs during delivery. This is not a medical guide nor is it supposed to be, but it is a wonderful supplement to those you already have."
3,"Fun, but Biased","This was a good book. Not the most informative, but girlfriends aren't doctors. It is down to earth and fun, but not always the most culturally sensitive or practical to everyone. Best for those who are high-mid class White women. It is like talking to your friend or mother, so the advice is sound and interesting which makes it different from all of the other other books you may come into contact with."
5,just get it!,"this is a must for every expectant mommy. just like staydol, it takes the edge off. great laughs when you are feeling a little tense about the whole body changing event. my husband thought it was male bashing, so he wasn't laughing too much. i went al' natural with kass (not that i wanted to as soon as the ""real"" contractions started) and it was fine. my girlfriend had a c section and she swelled up like a balloon. major pain for her. all in all, it is a fab book. loaned it out twice and it's on it's way out again! have fun! kitt"
5,I almost laughed myself into labor!,"This is the book that will get you through your pregnancy. The other ""technical"" and serious books will give you what you need to know - this will give you the strength to go on. With each month of your pregnancy, Vicki's words ring truer and truer. I laughed myself into fits and cramps, at times shedding tears because of her easy reading, no holds barred narrative.Vicki does not leave any taboo subject out - and no ""surprises"" for the big day.If you or a friend of yours is having a baby - and has even the slightest sense of humor - this is the book to lighten the often heavy, depressing weight of information you must consume.Buy itRead itShare it!"
2,"Save your $, borrow it from the library","The reviews on here rave about this book. I do not agree. The book was amusing and funny (also a bit scary) but I certainly wouldn't follow the advice in it, unless you have a lot of extra $ and time to throw around. The advice and information wasn't very practical. If you want practical advice and a down to Earth conversation about pregnancy talk to your own friends, you're much more likely to have something in common with them than Vicki Iovine."
3,I expected so much more,"I expected this book to be informative and hilarious. Instead, I feel I was talked down to and that this woman was trying to force her opinion on whomever's reading the book. To each her own. I whole heartedly disagree with her views on exercise during pregnancy. There are studies that show women who exercise before and during their pregnancies hold up better during labor because they are more physically fit. Remember to take everything you read with a grain of salt. Read this book after you've read a few others first."
5,simply wonderful,"this CD is culled from Shirley's first two Prestige albums back in the late 50's, just organ, bass, and drums. I like these recordings of hers better than the later music with large accompaniment, this is just straight ahead, stripped down jazzy blues done with great flair and style. No way you won't like this one."
4,Great Bag,"I love this bag, it is very durable and it gets tossed around a lot. My only complaint is the lack of rigidity. So i typically carry a large notebook or legal pads to add more structure to the bag... Though that is the only complaint i have making it a four star rather than a five star product."
5,I WANT BOOK 2!!!,Excellent book - I have been waitting since this book came out for book 2. When will we see it hit the store?
5,Good old songs...,"During this live concert Banco plays most of the better numbers that has made them popular over the years, and by including many of the past members of the group, some of the old feel is recaptured. Francesco's voice has darkened a bit over the years, but it is still strong. The recording is above average for a live concert, but there are a few dead spots where the mics cut out or something. I really miss Gianni's playing, and I wish he would re-join his brother in the group. The playing is first-rate. Guest Mauro Pagani of PFM is in fine form, though I am not sure he was used to the best effect. His violin passages seemed somehow out of place in Non Mi Rompete.Overall, a good effort. I'd like to have them do this in studio."
5,hungarian folk blossoms under marvelously modern orchestra!,"ZOLTAN KODALY WAS A COMPOSER OF THE FIRST RANK.HIS THRILLNG `DANCES OF GALANTA`WILL LEAVE YOUR SPIRIT SOARING,INSPIRED,AND THIRSTY FOR MORE.THE`HARY JANOS SUITE`IS BASICALLY FAIRY TALE MUSIC AWASH WITH BRIGHT HUES OF YELLOW,ORANGE,AND BLUE.IT IS PURE MAGIC.A LITTLE MORE THAN A HINT OF GYPSY PERMEATES THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE CD AND THE CHICAGO SYMPHONY TRULY CONFIRMS IT`S REPUTATION AS ONE OF THE WORLD`S FINEST.ALL CLASSICAL MUSIC LOVERS SHOULD BUY THIS NOW!!!!"
1,Complete waste of time and money!!!,"I have bought and read several books that were nothing to write home about but never felt the urge to write a review about them. This book is an exception to that rule.I would not recommend this book to anyone, not even my enemy.From my point of view, this author does not appear to have enough experience in consulting. Most of the stuffs he mentioned in this book were common sense/knowledge to even anyone not into computer. He failed to provide any significant info. His style of writing was like hiding info from the reader or he does not have any experience whatsoever on what he's writing about.Please don't waste your time on a book where all the author has to say is that you have to work hard to be a successful consultant -do I need to buy a book to tell me that?"
4,Good book,Good plot and good story. It is a love story and mystery together. Reads quickly and I would recommend it.
4,Farmer's wife,I uploaded book free. This book was an easy read. The story line was predicable but still enjoyable. I would recommend it.
2,American flag,"The flag is OK. It sounds pretty bad when I pressed the button. Maybe the batteries came with this flag are old. I have not changed any new battery yet. It is not worth $25. It is OK for $5. If you have to pay for shipping, I won't get it."
2,Not worth the money in the least.,"I also own one of these 'tractors'. We replace spindles two or three times per year. We, too, have been told repeatedly that we must be hitting something to cause the breakage. I disagree 100%. We mowed this grass for years with a push mower and never bent a blade or hit anything. Then, we had a Wheelhorse and it worked fine for years. This mower is just a bad design and we will never own another one. And yes, we have it serviced by a professional yearly and have had the spindles replaced by a certified Husqvarna repair professional, so they are torqued properly."
5,PUTTING FACES BEHIND THE MADNESS,"I had heard about this book through the grapevine. Decided to pick it up and am glad that I did. More fascinating than the main plot was the subplot--four people who had fallen victim to crack addition. It has help me better understand how people I knew 'got there'. Helped me to see how desperate wrong choices began the nightmare for them that few have been able to pull themselves from. I don't agree with Publisher's Weekly summary about the romance between Black and Clarisse. As a writer myself, I always try to see the ending coming, but Mr. Jones successfully did not allow me to. I was pleasantly surprised by it, something I beleive is a sign of a true talent.Hats off to you Mr. Jones. I am looking forward to your next endeavor."
5,A thrilling debut,"I read this book months ago, but I haven't reviewed it on this site until now. Nonetheless, I've never read a suspense/mystery before this, but this book is unbelievable. I've never read anything like this. It goes up there among the best. You have to be open-minded to be able to understand all the characters. It is amazing and this cat Solomon Jones has earned a fan for life!"
2,Gluten free but taste like its stale,"Gluten free but taste like its stale. This happens from time to time. At what they charge for this product, this should never happen."
4,My son was not wild,"I like these, but my son, who is the gluten-free one, did not. I don't think it was the taste, I think it was that he did not like the texture. He is only about three, and we were looking for new textures for him. We now know that the licorice texture is not the way to go. We will try it again in a few years."
5,Great for panoramas,"I use this lens with the Nodal Ninja R1 VR head to produce 360 degree panoramas with very little effort.Nodal Ninja provides the non-parallax point for this lens so there is no messing around to find that.I use Autopano stitching software to assemble the shots and like all stitching software, it does not like chromatic aberration. The vast majority of all fish-eyes have this problem to varying degrees. This lens is no exception.So, you need to clean this up before assembling the panorama and Nikon's Capture NX2 knows all about this lens and does a great job of making that correction.Bottom line: A great lens that plays well with others and takes sharp, very enjoyable shots."
5,Beautiful Lens,"The lens, as always with Nikon lenses is beautiful.A great lens, 180 angle of view. Perfect quality.I needed the lens for a job and it worked perfect.I used it on a Nikon D7000, a real good match for this kind of lens.At the beginning I did not know if it was a good idea to order camera equipment from Amazon. Some people had told me the warranties did not work because Amazon was not listed as an authorized dealer, but I found out and I asked Amazon about it and they assured me the warranty works as if it was purchased with an authorized dealer.The price was right, the delivery on time, and the customer service always ready to help."
4,Works Well,This is my 2nd purchase of these cold pacs. They work well. I particularly like the contour neck cold pac.
1,Horrible,"Although the product seems great at first, especially for a knee (even though it is supposed to be for the neck), this is the second one I bought which burst and oozed a nasty slimy stuff all over my sofa. And I only had it for 3 weeks! When the first one burst, I immediately purchased another thinking I had somehow abused the product, but this one burst and I was very, very careful with it. That means a lot of money down the drain. And now I see others saying the same thing has happened. This is very disappointing in that I need ice therapy for my knee and back for the rest of my life and now I don't know what I am going to do. If anyone has a suggestion, I would sincerely love to hear it."
5,What the %@#$ is wrong with MTV?,"I used to watch liquid television religiously just to see the Maxx shorts. I never quite understood what was going on and only got to see a few episodes due to the fact that MTV would play the same shows over and over again. Still, from time to time, I've wondered how the series ended. I was just talking to my husband about it the other night and it dawned on me that I should use the internet. Alas, no dvd, only vhs. Well, I guess I'll have to buy the videotape, send it to my dad, have him burn it onto a dvd and send it to me here in Iraq. I really loved the few episodes that I saw and now that I know the full series is available. . . I just have to have it. It really sucks that MTV hasn't made it available on dvd. I mean, you can get Laguna Beach and those stupid real world shows. Pop culture today leaves a lot to be desired. MTV. . . put out the frickin' dvd!!!"
5,Maxx is amazing!,"Pure brilliance, I could watch this video over and over. Sam Keith's artwork simply comes ALIVE. The multi-medi effects are seem-less and beutifull. A must have. END"
1,Worst Battery I've ever purchased,This thing lasts for 30 min tops. The worst battery ever. I thought if I ran it through a few cycles it would be fine but just terrible.
1,FIRE LOTION-GUARANTEED TO BURN & HURT LIKE CRAZY,"TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN,I WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST TO ANYONE WHO READS THIS TO NEVER BUY NAIR FOR MEN. IF YOU HAVE, THEN I'M SURE YOU SHARE MY FRUSTRATION. I USED NAIR FOR MEN FOR THE FIRST TIME LASTNIGHT & IT REMOVED THE HAIR ALRIGHT AS WELL AS BURN THE @$*! OUT OF MY CHEST & NIPPLES.SINCERELY, A GUY WITH SORE NIPPLES."
5,Buy It!,"Banana Bay has it all--adventure and action, mystery, romance and humour. Matti Maitlin is a delightful protagonist; the plot will enthrall you from the start. In the backdrop of Boston, Massachusett's South Shore and Panama, Cindy Cody has conveyed an intriguing sense of place."
2,My name is Panama,"I loved the first part of the book. I've been to Panama and it rang true the way The Tailor of Panama by John Le Carre never did. However, the end of Cindy's book sucked big time and I did not finish reading it. Mattie, the insurance adjuster, was unbelievable and all the stuff done just to make the book a decent length was trash. The book jacket says Cindy is working on her third Mattie book. So where is the second? I'd like to read more because of the Panama details. Sometimes authors learn how to make their characters better so here's hoping Cindy will learn."
4,Pictoral Trip to Greece,"This is a great book for the traveler on a medium budget interested in a pictoral trip to the islands. The book rates the sights and gives highlights in each town without getting you bogged down with too many details about specific museum exhibits or lists of every possible tourist attraction. Such an overview is especially valuable to the first-time traveler. Detailed maps of the different islands show main driving routes. The colored town maps are abbreviated, making it easy to check for key spots. Extra tidbits of information about writers and historical facts are given in sidebars. The small but generous number of pictures gives you a feel for where you might like to go."
5,Excellent Novel!,"If you have ever played the Starcraft game, then you will find this book simply a treat. It carefully follows the storyline played out until about the end of the Terran campaign, while throwing in some background information on the Protoss as well. If you have never played the game, the book is still an enjoyable read and an excellent start for a new series."
5,Very Exciting,This book was great. I loved all of the details. Ihaven't played the game but i want to go out and rent it just to play.
4,Good Book for 2 non busy days,"Well, first if all i played the game before reading. Certainly i was expecting for more action here but fortunately I got better stuff than that. It really explains how the events were made and the issues the characters have. You don't see that in the game and also helps you to think yourself: ""It is awesome how this character faced that... I know (he/ she) was this way but this really shows how hard the situation was""Main characters are well detailed and it was good to know Mr Liberty, haha Never knew the SCV carrying the Psi Disrupter in the campaign next to Kerrigan was him LOL.I would give this 5 starts, but there is only one contra for me. If i hadn't been a Star craft player, I would have gotten lost when descriptions of zerg and prottos were made.... However, I understand, It was was not known for any of the characters there.... So take it easy if descriptions of zergs and prottos are not deep."
4,excellent,after playing the game i thought this would be a guide but it was a good book about mostly terrian. ireccomend this book to terrian fans who little about zurgs or protists
3,Hmm...,"Put simply, this quick read of a book is one of many to be experienced by anyone who truly wants to gain some operational insight on race -- one of the final frontiers of human understanding. Until we come up with a workable (or definitive) solution to the strange phenomenon that is ""race,"" (other than complete avoidance of the topic, that is,) 'Race Manners' does a good job of being one of many tools for one's sociological 'toolkit.' It doesn't have all the answers...but then again, who does?"
2,"OK, but Could be Better","There are several points made in the book that get the reader to think about how they view races. However, it is definitely slanted towards black views. I think the book could be very powerful if re-written with a white co-author. I was hoping to find a 50/50 view. It was more of a 70/30."
4,Good value for a good cat toy,"This toy has been used and abused and my cats still use it. The only two things are (1) the mouse gets beat up and I haven't found a replacement option for the mouse; (2)the second thing is it is so light it falls over, if it had weight on the bottom it would solve the problem. Overall a good toy for the price."
3,my review,This product seemed like fun for my cats. My cats liked it when it first arrived then grew bored with it soon after. My cats are very spoiled and older. I think a kitten would be delighted with it 24/7.
2,NEITHER OF MYCATS FOUND THIS TOY INTERESTING.,"NEITHER OF MY CATS HAD ANY INTEREST IN IT, INSPITE OF MY REPEATEDLY SPINNING THE MOUSE AROUND.THEY FOUND IT BORING."
3,My cat doesn't like it,"My cat isn't interested in this toy. It seems reasonably well made, but he played with it for a little while and now ignores it."
5,Apc Universal Battery,"so far works very well, charging my Garmin with it. I think I'm getting 4-5 charges out of it."
3,Good stuff,"This does the job well. We have to keep several machines going to keep the house from falling apart,motor old wood...and this liquid keeps the machines clean."
4,"Not perfect, but it works...","This rake seems to have a nice design and is fairly light weight. If you just use 1 extension piece it's pretty sturdy and looks like the photo on the box - a straight pole. But we were very surprised to see how much bow there is to the pole when you've got more extensions attached to it. The longer it is, the more the rake ""dips"", and it becomes pretty awkward to position it where you want it. It felt something like trying to land a great big fish with one of those old fashioned long bamboo poles!But at any rate, for us, it was still a good purchase because it allows us to reach every inch of our 1 story home's roof. (So we can drag down all the big cotton piles which accumulate from our neighbor's cottonwood tree and never seem to blow off.) I'm sure in winter it'll work great to scrape just a few feet of snow away from the edge of the roof/gutters - because we'll only need 1 extension to reach - but it's still August, we're not anxious to test that!"
3,Roof rake missing parts,"I purchased the rake the end of December and received it the first week in January (quick delivery). Upon opening the box, I found that the bolts and nuts were missing. I contacted the supplier and were told to purchase them myself. After a few e-mails, they agreed to issue me a credit for the missing parts. They expected me to pay (again) for the missing parts."
5,totally love it!,I love this one. Helped me so much to get rid of big pile of snow on the garage roof this year.
3,Performed well with much work,"Overall this rake did well on my ranch home, with a ton of work. The more extensions were added, the more difficult it was to lift the rake, and position it to a new section to clear. I could not clear all the way to the peaks of my roof however was able to clear approx. 3-4ft up from gutters which served my purpose.The one complaint I had was that I ordered this with 2-day service, and had to wait 5 days to receive. When I contacted the mfg, they advised it was out of stock at the time of order. I had no idea this was the case as there was no label advising me of such when I ordered. Since I needed it right away, I would have ordered another brand."
4,snow rake,"The snow rake I ordered came on time as promised and is of high quality. It does everything as advertised. It's a bit awkward at the full length of over 20 ft., which is needed to reach the peak of my ranch style house, but it gets the job done and due to the scooped design it doesn't ""walk"" from side to side as reported of some other rakes I've read about. I would recommend this product to those interested."
1,Junk,One of the aluminum middle sections split on one end (imagine a partially peeled banana) after its first five minutes of use. Guess I'll be looking for another brand. Unbelievable.
4,great value,"Williams-Sonoma has 4 oz of these in a little glass jar for over 12 dollars...that would be over $50 with tax for this much. Either that little glass jar is worth 40 bucks (probably more like $1) or you'd be insane to buy this stuff from anywhere else. These peppercorns are the best. Frontier is a good supplier, so save yourself 40 dollars and put the extra 3/4 lb of peppercorns into an airtight, opaque container in a cool pantry. Say no to wasting lots and lots of money."
2,Cheap packaging - slightly deceptive photo of product,"Product seems ok but, is shipped in a flimsy cellophane bag that cannot be reclosed. (Note that the photograph of the product appears to show the rim of a jar, but the ad intentionally avoids a description of the packaging.) A cheap jar with a screw on lid would not have added much to the price."
1,no heat heaters,the holmes heaters are avery poor product.they get so hot on the electric cord that they are afire hazard.i bought 22 ceramic heters and not one of them was any good.
3,rod tube,"Works as advertised. It's a plastic tube with caps. notto much to go wrong with it. A little thin, but not expensive."
5,Great read!!,If you enjoy reading true crime then definitely give this one a chance. Fast paced from the very beginning and never falters. It's a rather quick read but very worth it.
2,OK but no brackets,I have not installed these yet but they seem like nice speakers only problem is they came worth no mounting hardware. I will figure it out but it would be nice to know ahead of time.
3,Blake's Review!!!,"I think the Bronx Masquerade was an okay book. I don't really like poetry, but it was interesting. The book has a lot of diffrent poems in it. I think the poems are meaningful!!"
4,This Great Book,This is a fantastic book that I think many people should read. It is not like a regular book that talks about one person. This book talks about different peoiple in different sorts of ways. It describes people through poems and other types of writing. It is very descriptive and tells us a lot about each character. The auther makes the book more interesting and make teenagers want to read the book.I read this book with a group of kids in the 8th grade for an English Class we are attending. All of us in the group thought that the book was well written and that we could follow what was happening.
2,dumb book,"Well I say you should not read this because it was to boreing for my likeing. It goes on and on about the same stuff, like the teacher was making the kids talk about the same thing all the time. The book could have been beeter set up than is was, I say that because it was annoying how you had to read every body was talking at the same time, what I mean is like in stead of having the people in the conversation talking in a sentence they have different chapters for what they say. Its really book disapointing."
2,Broke in one use...,"This product did seem to work...for the entire 2 minutes before it broke. A cap came loose at the end of the cleaner. The water started leaking out through the gap and it would no longer work.In contrast, Amazon customer service was outstanding and has shipped a replacement. Hopefully the replacement will last longer..."
3,Worked after I got it re-assembled . . .,"Worked well AFTER I reassembled it. Same deal as the Wagner Power Painter. Zero packing and the item was apart, the sprayer from the shell, when it arrived. It was a real witch to reassemble so I could use it. Clearly NOT made to be taken apart. After my previous experience of no answer from Wagner, didn't bother to write. Won't bother to purchase from them again either."
4,a must for dog breeders,I found this book to be very helpful. It has a lot of good advice that that a person who is interested in dog breeding should know. I would highly recommend anyone interested in raising dogs read this book before starting out. It could save a lot of headaches from trail and error type of breeding situations.
1,Breed 'em?,"What do you have to do? Hire a shadkhan? It should be a major project, like a dynastic marriage, you should have allies in the next war?Don't they breed anyway? Everybody I ever met, people or dogs, they had it on their own agenda, nobody had to tell them."
4,Breeding Dogs For Dummies,Great starter book. Picked up a few pointers that helped me understand the next book which was definitely NOT a primer. Plus this book was easy to bookmark for future reference. Would recommend this title to anyone who is just getting started and also has a mentor to refer to.
2,Not in Good Condition,"This product was labeled to be in ""Very Good"" condition, but it was not. Exercises were often already completed or filled in with pencil, or even pen. The book itself was in good condition, but some of the exercises can't be torn out and turned in because they're already used."
4,Handle design could be better,This tool comes with a side handle which can only be attached to the tool housing using an extension rod. This places the handle far from the tool itself apparently for leverage but I find that it increases the size of the tool making it more difficult to work in tight spaces.
1,Poor shipping from HRM USA and hard to talk to a person,I ordered this from HRM USA and only received the reservoir and not the backpack. I called them up and finally was able to speak to someone. I am told that I will have the backpack shipped to me. I am annoyed that I will not have this in time for a hike I was planning to use it for.The product is fine but it may be better to buy it somewhere else if you need it for a certain time or do not want the hassle of shipping issues.
2,Good Vocals but bad recording,"The vocals sound fine, but the subsonic noise recorded on this album will drive your woofers crazy. If your speakers reproduce low frequencies at 50 Hz and below, you will need a low pass cut off filter to play this disc. If not, you will see your grill cloth moving as the woofers attempt to play the subsonic noise on every track this album. DG has done it again. They manage to ruin recordings with their recording engineer processing."
1,broken After 6 uses,"I have a hand bike I used the water bottle cage maybe 5 or 6 times. The last ride of 15 miles the cage snapped and the water bottle fell out. It appears the tubing is too thin, and where the weld is must of have been brittle."
1,Not worth the money,"I only read about 40 pages before I gave up. The characters are unlikeable, and have a great ""fall"" with out you ever understanding how society worked and why the ""fall"" is a bad thing. It's like they chopped off the first three chapters of the book and started in the middle. Further, I know that in the fantasy world, the use of different words for common stuff is standard, but it helps if there is enough of a description that you can figure out what that new word means! I read over 100 books a year, and in the past 10 years there have been about 4 books that I didn't finish, this is one of them. I have better books to read!"
4,A definite keeper..,"I've read the 1st 2 books in the series twice & have just ordered book 3. Well done, Ms. Monette! Melusine is a splendid, engaging read with nicely developed characters & a dynamic, energized plot; the story moved, the characters were different @ novel's end than novel's beginning. We quickly come to care for these people. Two brothers who love each other but aren't sure why exactly is a subplot adding nice tension, & Monette creates a world almost familiar; Michangelo & Da Vinci could easily have cameoed. Still, there are elements particular to this setting, such as some people having magical ability, some not & the social bellicosities created by this phenomenon. There are things to discover, things to learn about this world & by novel's end readers will not only want to see more of this world but will find themselves shaking ineffectual fists @ the closing of the curtain."
2,I wanted to like this but...,"There are many things which interested me about this book before I picked it up: discussions of the excellent world building as well as the nontraditional romance - - but the slow pacing and the extreme amount of back story/explanation of the 'world' in the first few chapters were so dense I couldn't get past them. I was not engaged by any of the characters, there are many introduced and none seem to be fully fleshed out. So little interest did I have that I'm sorry to say I didn't even finish the story. I'd definitely give the author another try though, - the world is very well thought through - so I may pick up the second novel and hope all the problems I had with the first are resolved."
1,Couldn't get into the book,"I began reading ti thinking the book was going to be awesome, becuase I read the back cover and thought that the story was going to be a great one, full of twists and of magib, but... not such luck.Maybe if I hadn't been flipping the pages of the book around, trying to get to the end without getting bored to no end, I would have enjoyed the book, but it didn't appealed to me, and as I said in the tittle of my review, I couldn't get into it."
2,Not one size fits all!,"My main complaint with this chest protector is it doesn't fit me very well. It has many adjustable straps but it's obviously made for a much bigger man than me (5'8"" 160lbs) and it hangs very loose around the shoulders. I tried to adjust it with some pins to make the straps tighter but it didn't work out. It's also not very thick. I play in an adult floor hockey league and some of the guys can shoot pretty hard. I took a slap shot right off the chest with this protector on and it HURT a lot worse than my Franklin street hockey chest protector. Would not recommend."
3,she can sing,The film was so-so but the music fantastic. Was that actually Lauri Crook singing that I-need-a-man song? WOW. Where can I buy a CD with that song on it? She belted out the best blues I have ever heard!
4,Boom Boom,These speakers have deep rich bass! They can handle watts put through them. Get your own because you can't have mine!
2,Had this sub for 3 weeks...ok but cant hit highs,"hit lows ok. maaad distortion with the low high beets. i think i just wasted my money im going to just push the subs as hard they can tell they blow......NOT 3600 WATTS BIG LIE... my 12"" sony xplodes hit harder.... sad and week will write again when they blow and how much they took"
1,Pyle is crappy,"I've had these for about a year now. They have been getting gradually weaker for the past 6 months or so. I have an Infinity 600 watt amp driving two 10"" subs wired at 8 ohms. The subs cant handle a 4 ohm load and cause the amp to trip. When I first got them i was impressed for the money but now I am getting different subs because these are so bad.UPDATE: I melted one this am with less than 300 watts. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more on a better sub that will last and make you happy. Pyle used to make decent stuff but they just make crap now."
1,samples from other songs,"This album is nothing but cut ups of songs from ""Sounds of the Favelas"" which is excellent, so you're better off buying that one. However this album just takes samples and loops from that one and remixes the songs. It's still not bad, but obviously ripped off from other music. ""Sounds of the Favelas"" came out in 96 and all of the playing is live. Get that one if you don't have it already."
4,"Comfortable, but it takes time","This sandal has the potential to be very comfortable, but there is definitely a not-so-comfortable ""breaking in"" period to work through at first. Now that I'm nearing the end of breaking it in, it's promising to be a sandal I wear regularly.I originally purchased the exact sandal in a women's large (in accordance with my foot and typical shoe size), but opted for the men's medium because it offered a wider fit that was more agreeable to my foot size.Overall, glad I made the purchase. Just don't be discouraged by the initial discomfort."
1,Way to small,Ordered size Large 9-5 10-5 I ware a 9-5 shoe these sandals would fit a small boy!!!!!!!!! Waste of money!
1,"amazon service POOR, rainbow service WORSE!!!!!","sizing information not just bad, but way off. Service from Amazon extremely poor, referred me to the vendor because the item needed to be returned due to size...needed a size 9, sandal ordered was supposed to fit size 8.5 - 9.5, thought that would be safe...sandal was about two inches too short...pretty bad! Had to return sandals - paid for shipping to get item, paid to return item, then paid to have it shipped back! Total shipping cost $21.00...pathetic! And Rainbow received sandals on June 13,(confirmed via DELIVERY CONFIRMATION)... I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED EXCHANGED SANDALS...IT IS NOW JULY 4TH!!! They just shipped the sandals according to someone at Rainbow on July 3rd...pretty poor business practice! I have no desire to deal with Amazon OR Rainbow again."
2,toooooooooooooooooooo small ............................,good service ... came on time ... son loved the look butttttttttttttttt he is a true size 11 and I ordered XL (11-12) ... his heal is hanging off the back of the sandal ....too bad ... now I have to go through he hassel of returning and exchanging the christmas giftwhat a pain ... i guess that's the pitfalls of ON_LINE shopping (sorry amazon)now after reading other reviews I know this fact ....tooooooo late
4,Great Sandles,"Got these for my son as a gift, he loved them. They do tend to run a little small but looks and quality are great."
5,Great after a painful start,"To be honest I nearly threw them away after a few days. I was informed that to begin with they might hurt a bit, especially I had not worn this type of sandal for many years, and sure enough after wearing then for 2 days I had blisters on both feet - very painful. But after a weeks rest they went back on are are now great - really comfortable. And a really well made product."
5,Loved them both,This is the first book I've read by the author and I really enjoyed them both. My favorite was My Lady Domino which I didn't want to put down. A Commercial Enterprise was good too but I would probably rate it a 4 instead of a 5. I'm excited to read more books from Heath.
1,Very poor - this is why...,"Never, I repeat, NEVER allow Biblical/Theological scholars to create their own guides and tools like this.This edition of the Strong's brutalizes the original edition, changing word meanings and etymologies to reflect Christian doctrine, not keeping true to the original Chaldean/Hebrew and Greek texts.Don't believe me? Use an original Strong's to look up Hebrew word #430, elohiym. This is given as the name of God throughout the NKV bible but in fact if you do a word etymology shows that this is a female plural word about a group of lesser, inferior gods.Follow this, and the key to Truth is yours. Don't listen to the lies of this edition of the book which changes and eliminates words which are tricky for Christianity to explain away. Man cannot be trusted to take care of knowledge properly, and this book is a prime example why.Get the original Strong's. If you seek the truth about the world you live in, that is."
1,Description Incorrect,"The description of this book as well and writing on the cover describe the print as large and easy to read. This could not be further from the truth. It is very tiny and difficult to read. I never really examined the contents, but returned it immediately."
1,True Christians,This book has an 'updated' Greek dictionary. Last time I checked this did not need to be updated. I would recommend extreme caution as using this tool for Greek/Hebrew word studies. Personally I would buy an older edition used before I bought this.
1,Technical Problem,"2 times the repair man has replaced the water pump. I've owned it just under 6 months. I use britta filtered water, still same problem with water pump. Highly dissapointed, feel I have wasted my money."
1,SHOULD BE MARLON SICKO !,"I HAVE NEVER READ SUCH A DISGUSTING BOOK. I HAD NO IDEA THAT MOST OF THE ACTORS I HAD ALWAYS LOVED WERE BISEXUAL OR TRISEXUAL! BARF!!MARLON WAS TRULY INSANE, IN MY OPINION. NOBODY LIKED TO WORK WITH HIM BUT THEY ALL WANTED IN HIS BED. MEN, WOMEN, CHILDREN, BOYS, VIRGINS, GROUPS, ANIMALS AND HIS OWN DAUGHTER FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE. WHICH CERTAINLY MESSED HER UP EMOTIONALLY. AS SHE LATER HUNG HERSELF.I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW WHY ""MR. MUMBLES"" WAS SO CELEBRATED?????? HOWEVER, AFTER PUTTING THE BOOK AWAY AND NOT FINISHING IT I FEEL COMPELLED TO GO BACK AND FINISH THE DARN THING!!! UGG!C. DANIELSEAGROVE BEACH, FL"
2,The End of Illusions,"If you still have any illusions about Hollywood and/or your favourite actors and actresses, please do not read this book or they'll be shattered for ever! Apart from that, a highly entertaining book, if somewhat repetitive."
3,Not strong enough for active people,"I wanted to try a new soap and I was attracted to this by the great ratings and reviews this bath gel had. I took a shower after my work out and even with my scrub, it didn't clean well. I still felt dirty and my skin felt weird and it didn't remove the residue that my deodorant had left on my under arms.I'm sure this would clean really well for the people who aren't that active and don't play sports or work out much. For every day people, I think this bat gel is great but it's not for the daily active/sports person."
5,Best shower gel!,"This is the best shower gel! The scent is great for men or women. In the winter, it does not dry out my skin nor does it leave any kind of a greasy feeling. We had a hard time finding the large size over the holidays. It must be popular."
5,Neutrogena Rainbath Gel,"I love this body wash, but Walgreen's in my area is starting to eliminate it from stock so I am glad to have a source. Good service Amazon!"
3,Leaves your skin feeling clean but do not like the scent.,"Bodywash leaves no residue on your skin so it cleans well and helps remove any extra oil on your skin if it is acne prone without over-drying. BUT, I would prefer another scent."
2,Novicewatching,"Mr. Desmond's book displays near complete inexperience with hroses. I wonder if he's even ridden a horse before. Furthermore, I thought the book was actually geared more towards children rather than adults. He has interesting facts here and there, but that's all I can say about it!"
5,Very Elabourate,"I don't think this book could have been written any better. As a fellow horse lover I have actually found myself communicaing with my horse a lot more. I think that Morris did an excellent job with this book, and I would highly recommend it to anyone loking for more information on horses."
4,Horsewatching,"Desmond Morris flavors this book with his brilliant way of translating what he sees, hears, and smells to create a solid picture of what a horse is all about. This is not another run of the mill book about horses, it really gives a peek into their soul."
4,Great effort from a sincere man.,"I bought this cd based on a review in my local paper, and I was not disappointed. I am only a moderate Charlie Daniels fan(I don't have any of his other records), but I am very happy with this cd! It is full of well done Christian classics with a country flair. The backing instrumentation is tight, as befits a band that has played together for so long, but what impressed me most is Charlie's vocals. He is not a great singer, but what he lacks in finesse he more than makes up in sincerity. It sounds as if he means what he sings 100%, unlike many country singers who throw in a gospel song just to appease their fans. Anyway this is a great album!"
5,Southern Gospel like only the CDB can make,"As always with Charlie Daniels, he gives his listeners a wide variety of flavors on this wonderful album. There is not one song here that doesn't sound good and real. He gives us everything from his classic southern rock to bluegrass, blues to country, and always sounds sincere. Daniels is a great Christian man and this album will become an instant favorite when you are in need of true inspiration. My favorite tracks are ""Softly and Tenderly,"" ""I'll Fly Away,"" ""Somebody Was Prayin' For Me,"" and ""Kneel At The Cross."""
4,Decent Clippers,"As the prior reviewer states, the description is indeed incorrect as these are made in China rather than the US as claimed. However, other than that they are decent clippers. They cut easily and cleanly. They are sharp enough without being so sharp that I worry about losing a limb when using them. I do find myself missing a built-in nail file as my old set had one, but I haven't really needed one as these clip clean enough on their own. They are also larger in width as well as length than the ""cheap"" clippers commonly found."
5,Nice Hitch,Installation was fairly easy. The instructions were pretty good too. My car didn't have the side holes they talked about but Hammer and Anvil fixed the carriage bolts enough to slip in through the slots just fine. My Thunderbird looks odd with the ball hiding the license plate. So I just store the removable receiver with the spare tire.
5,Great product,Since I have been using this product my beagle no longer gets UTIs or stones. I swear by it and don't know why all vets don't recommend it.
5,An enjoyable romp though upscale L.A.,"This is a particularly well-plotted mystery -- complex but not so complex you need charts to keep track of timelines and characters. There are several subplots that manage to come together in one way or another, and a few red herrings to distract the reader.Madeline Bean, caterer to the wealthy of Los Angeles, is the ""detective"" of this story. If I had to say what the book is about, it would be hard to know where to begin, because of all the subplots. Would I begin with the private papers she finds on her driveway? With the catered event where a saxaphone gets stolen? With the owner of the private papers (who is at the event) getting so upset when she tries to tell him she's found these papers? With a wild car ride with a very angry man? Or with the corpse found at her house?The action never stops in this book. It will keep you up late for sure. And I was genuinely surprised by the killer, although it all made sense."
5,favourite of the series,"This is a favourite book of a favourite series. The mystery in in Perfect Sax is the most engrossing and complicated of all the books, in addition to tieing up non-mystery threads from earlier books (don't want to spoil the surprise).As always, I enjoyed the hearing about the cooking creations and the effort used to stage a complicated party event, and existing in Maddie's world.If you enjoyed earlier books you'll like this."
3,Works Well When Cleaned Properly,"Our family has purchased several Sunbeam Vaporizers over the years and have had good luck with these units. The Larger-tank unit is a better deal as it holds more water.The unit produces steam which is why we buy them--steam helps to warm the air as it adds moisture and also kills any organisms in the water. More expensive cool-mist humidifiers do NOT kill bacteria and fungus and their cool mist cools the room temperature.This unit requires regular cleaning to keep it working well--our water has much calcium so we clean the electrodes after every 2 or 3 uses. Simply scrape the scale from the electrodes and put the unit back in service. As the electrodes wear down, a replacement head unit for the device can be purchased direct from the manufacturer--no need to keep buying the water tank."
3,We had this for a while,"This is not bad for a cheap humidifier. However:- Lots of water on/around the tank after a couple of hours (have to put it on a mat or a pile of towels)- stopped working after about a year- have to clean the electrodes (it is a *warm* mist humidifier - it boils the water)All in all, I was happy (got it for twelve bucks last year). The boiling kills a lot of thebacteria you get from the ""ultrasound"" humidifiers.That said, I am in the market for something that will run longer, be less messy, more durable, andeasier to maintain."
4,The book can add to the public knowlege on kurds.,The kurds are the most neumerous people on earth without their own state.Outsiders have approached kurds in different ways; I do not know of any people belonging to western culture to suppport kurds without reservesions. Susan has learned a lot while working on this project. Let us hope that her work changes the position of reservesions.
3,Would rather read a single personal account,"Although this is a quality book, it is so overpriced that few people would ever buy it or get a chance to read it. I believe that the world is in great need of a readable volume about a Kurd who suffered through and survived the chemical attacks. I hope that an author famous for bringing to life the experiences of individuals will tackle this much needed project. Most people need to be educated on the Kurdish issue and on the Armenian issue. Such a book on either subject that targets ONE LIFE, I will buy and pass along to my Kurdish and Armenian relatives. This one is too convoluted and out of price range."
5,"Don't just stand there, do something.","How easily some are driven to passionate criticism of someone who could teach them.If you don't read the book, look for the movie.I am sure that Black Elk needs even more people in addition to Wallace Black Elk to spread the knowledge and the reverence to the Earth.To criticize Wallace Black Elk objecting to Christians is like criticizing Jews for objecting to Nazis. Such was the effect, except onehundredfold: worldwide genocide, pillage, suppression, slavery and dominion of millions.Wallace Black Elk opens our eyes to the brutal truth, the unspeakable and unpaid debt Christianity has to all indigenous people."
1,So sad to see him do this to his people,"Wallace ""Black Elk""'s real name is Wallace Black Elk Cow. He is NOT related to the famous Black Elk in any way. The real Black Elk's family has been trying to get Wallace to quit deceptively using their family name for decades. He is not even of the same tribe. What is truly sad is that so many whites who don't know any better will look to a shady character like Wallace for guidance. Wallace sells ceremonies, which is considered unethical by native traditionalists. In this book he reveals a lot of things that are supposed to be kept private or only taught orally and face to face in the traditional way. Wallace has greatly dismayed native people with his selling out to the New Age for the sake of cash. The saddest thing is that, nearly thirty years ago, he once was a respected medicine man. But he threw all that away for cash. If you want to learn about native religions, try Vine Deloria's God Is Red. But don't give this opportunist your cash instead."
4,Lush neo-classic delight,Discovered Taneyev quite by accident and what a wonderful surprise. Symphony #4 is quite beautiful and Oresteia overture is powerful. Sure it's derivative but more attention to Taneyev and contemporary Kalinnikov must be paid!
1,"Too many pictures, not enough words.","I love Seinfeld, the show about nothing. In books though, I prefer words to pictures. Please note that this book is a collection of B&W photographs (beautifully taken I must admit) with short comments written by the shows' stars. I was VERY disappointed by this book thinking/ hoping it would be more like those episode guide/ behind the scenes books taking a look at a favorite show."
3,Belkin Battery Backup,"Although product seems to work fine, accompaning software lacked some features and actually stopped system from booting. Still using and appears to be doing the job. I would have liked to see some indication of probable run time after interuption."
1,LeapFrog ClickStart My First Computer Adapter review,"Basically the adapter proved useless. The computer flashed a low battery warning on screen every 3 seconds when it was running from this adapter. I ended up using a universal adapter, purchased for $[...] running at 5V instead."
4,Better than the alternative,Buying this for my kids Click Start was alot better than having to purchase C batteries every month.
3,Does the job well,I was going through way too many batteries so this is just what we needed. I would probably not still have the clickstart computer if it required any more batteries. It doesn't seem as great to the kids with a Wii in the house now.
5,Works great!,Used it to clean a scratchy volume control on my car's stereo. Two quick sprays and it no longer scratches. Works great!
4,4 Track UK Import,4 Track UK Import. Songs are: Everyday is a winding road - If it makes you happy - All I wanna do - Run baby run.
4,A powerful and transforming story,"This true story by Kate Morgan deeply affected me. There were several times when I was moved to tears as Kate touched on parts of my life and offered glimpses of hope. As I am starting my own personal transformation, Kate's story is a great inspiration for me. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is challenging himself or herself to find a better, healthier way of living."
4,Lot's of fun,The toy is alot of fun to play with for a child who does not have a real cat. I bought one for my 2 year old nephew and he is very rough with his toys. The fur real friend is durable enough to handle his roughness. We are planning to buy him a real cat next year and this helps to teach him how to care for the cat before actually owning a real one. I am very pleased with the toy and with the price. Well worth it.
3,very breakable,"The boomerang itself is easily scratched and broken. After just a few tries it was scratched, chipped, and peeling. I think it is pretty big and for long distance throwing since i got it stuck on my neighbors roof and then when i lost it forever in the water. I think its hard to use, i never got it to come back but throwing it is still fun."
4,Learning experience,"I suppose this would have been more fun if we learned how to use it better. But it did hold up very well to wedging itself into the ground, bouncing off of trees, and being stolen by the dog."
4,Does the trick,I purchased these mainly for the pick. I have very little teeth issues but I have a little spot that collects tartar. So I use it for that spot. Works perfectly!
3,"Good enough, I guess","Mirror is biggest complaint, the circle of glass on the end of the tool moves around instead of staying in place.Can easily get water, saliva, whatever behind the glass. Which just seems very unsanitary for any more than a few uses.Metal tools are of cheap metal, but, that's what was expected, so no complaints there."
5,"Holy crap, this thing is powerful!","Great Drill - has enough power to snap your wrist off, so the side handle is a must. 2 complaints, but I'll still give 5 stars. First, the reverse switch is a thin piece of plastic and I'm always careful switching it - I'm always afraid that it'll snap. Second, the drill has so much power that the clamp that holds the side handle broke off. But, better the clamp than my wrist. I found the replacement clamp online for $4. I bought a few of them so I'll never be left without the side handle while on the job. I've had mine for 5 years now and it's still running strong."
4,Charming story,"This is the first K.C. McKinnon book I have read. I found myself captured from the beginning. I love the appeal of the small town and McKinnon is able to capture that without making it seem ""hokey."" I was reminded of Jan Karon's Mitford series - I was caught up in the characters and did not want to stop reading until I knew what would happen. Even though the outcome felt predictable, it felt comfortable to me. As a cancer survivor, I found meaning in Dee Dee's need to orchestrate the future for her son. McKinnon presented a realistic view of the fear of life ending too soon and Dee Dee's choice to plan her exit. I have already passed this book on to my friends."
1,"Boy, did I make a mistake!","I was looking for a good source book to improve my diet and health. I've done the Master Cleanse several times with excellent results.What I got included a rant on the evils of conventional medicine. If I didn't know better, I'd feel guilty for seeing a medical doctor in addition to alternative therapists after reading part of this book.I could have done without the ""conspiracy"" aspects...and I especially disliked the fact that the author used the term, ""studies show"" several times without the actual studies being cited.Maybe this book has some worthwhile information in it, but I couldn't even get halfway through it.I'm going to try and return it, and if that doesn't work, I'm recycling it. Hopefully the next time the paper gets used it will be to present a far less rigid point of view."
1,not the right edition,I've ordered the 2011 edition and have been sent the 2004 edition. Thank you Amazon. It would have been easier to go and buy it at a store in the end.
5,Awesome! I hail this game!,"When I bought X-Wing, I noticed the graphics weren't the best, but when my A-Wing's blasters blew a TIE into space dust, I knew I loved this game."
3,Be Wary of Changes,"It is currently 4th on PC World's top 10 CDRW's. The review said it included the full version of Nero Burning Rom 5.5, and Mount Rainier support. I could not find anything on Cendyne's site or sites selling the drive either verifying or disputing these specifications, so I assumed it was true. When I received the drive it contained only Nero Express, which is a stripped down version of Burning Rom, 1 very cheap cd-r disc (usually you get 1 cdrw and 1 cdr with many drives), and scant documentation. Nero diagnostic said it did not have Mount Rainier support, either. I do not hold PCWorld responsible, since their drive probably did have the features they wrote, and Cendyne changed the drive later. This should have been noted on the Cendyne site. I am returning the drive, and would advise sticking with brand name drives for quality software packages and specs that don't change on the sly."
4,A suumary history of the right wing dictator of Spain.,"I have read many books about the Spanish Civil War and Franco's participation in it. This is a nice summary history of a brutal dictator who had people executed. It also explains his plodding military campaign that was ultimately a success. It is clear that the author does not put Franco as a heroic dictator or right wing fanatic, but as a leader of his times who skillfully evaded the tenacles of Nazi Germany. Franco was a more skillful politician than soldier.This is a great read for those who desire to know more about Franco and Spain. It is not lengthy, so can be read in one day."
1,Aggravation,"I own three companiesI have contacted Belkin to purchase several units.No one could speak Enlish or answer a question about this product.It took 40 minutes for them to get my phone number right. That was a waste of time as well since they never called or E mailed me back.I will never know if the product works or not because I don't have that much time to waste trying to talk to them,Dean"
5,"Finally, a Truly Holistic Weight Loss Program!","This book is not only weight changing but life changing!Not just another diet book - it is the first book to deal with weight holistically. The focus is mind, body, spirit. This holistic focus helped me become aware of my own self-limiting beliefs which were key for me in finally sticking with a program. I learned to eat differently - not to deprive myself. I lost 85 pounds using this program and even ran the Chicago Marathon this year!"
2,Battery life limits its usefulness,"I bought this light to be more visible when riding home around dusk. It's plenty bright enough for that when the batteries are fresh, but that's a very temporary condition. I ride about 50 minutes each way on my daily commute. The front light lasts about 4 hours on two AA batteries. At that rate, it doesn't take very many rides before this light isn't such a bargain.On the other hand, I'm very happy with the taillight. It uses LEDs, so battery life isn't an issue. It has steady and blink modes. It's very basic, but it does the job.If you buy this set, buy it for the taillight and use the headlight as a backup to whatever other light you use."
5,everyone should read this book!,"*Made to Break* provides an easy-to-read history of planned obsolescence. It is written for general audiences. Everyone should read this book and demand that hundreds more like it be written.Despite the fact that we are destroying our planet and poisoning ourselves, very little is written on planned obsolescence. We need to be better educated about how consumers are manipulated into developing costly and wasteful habits of consumption. It breaks my heart to watch how ignorance is cultivated in our consumer culture. we are all wasting our money and contributing to the destruction of the earth. we need more accessible books on this topic!!!"
2,Disappointed,When I started to read this book I really enjoyed it but after the first few chapters I felt that the rest was filler. I lost interest quickly but think it is worth picking up (at the library) and reading the beginning.
3,"Nice book, but a bit thin","Lonely planet books are usually a good companion both if you're clueless or experienced. In this case however, the book is a lot thinner than the Rough Guide for Scotland and offers less information. The LP looks better, but who cares about the looks of a travel book."
4,An evocative collection of stories.,"After reading ""Stanley Park"", I checked to see what else this author might have written and read this collection of short stories.This collection really showcases Tim Taylor's talents. All the stories are tightly written and very evocative. His writing style is very detailed and immerses you into the environment he's set the story in.The tales in the collection show elements he later used Stanley Park, and the novella at the end of the collection show the same fine attention to detail.There isn't a bad story in the lot - a solid 4 star rating."
3,The symbols are not clear and too small,"The sound is good, but the symbols are not clear and too small to read. I would not recommend this product unless you are young and can read miniscule print and symbols."
2,not happy,"I wanted a portable CD player with an option for repeat. This has one, however it turns off after a time so the repeat is not continuous."
1,"If I could give it only a half-star, I would.","One word: Disappointment. Okay, maybe two words: Boring. You would think from the title that this book would delve into the Starcraft background. Xel'Naga - the creator of the Protoss and Zerg. But in fact, there's nothing here about the races. No background, no insight. It's almost as if the author didn't research the Starcraft universe and filled out a ""Sci-Fi Mad Libs"" where they said in this formulaic story <insert alien race name here>. Example: ""And all of a sudden three aliens lunged at her. It wasn't long before <insert alien race here> infiltrated the old man's shack.""It also seems to be written by a juvenile. I have a feeling that all the ""4 star"" reviews here are planted by the publisher and author, because it's obvious they don't know any more about the Starcraft universe than the author did."
2,"Better than the first one, but not by much.","I enjoyed Shadow of the Xel'Naga more than Liberty's Crusade, but still less than I expected to. The plot was original this time, not just lifted from the in-game storyline. However, the series seems to be written for little kids instead of avid StarCraft fans. Nevertheless, the book is enjoyable and the battle imagery greatly improved from Liberty's Crusade. It was refreshing to read about SC units acting quasi-real, instead of just in the context that you see them in the game. The story line is original and the ending is neither predictable nor boring. If you didn't like the first one, I would give Shadow of the Xel'Naga a chance, you might like it better, however, speaking as a long-time SC fan, the authors take too much liberty messing around with unit traits and abilities. (It is not up to them to decide what psi-powers the protoss have in addition to the ones in the game...)"
1,AHHHH!!!,"I am a humungo fan of starcraft and i got this book strickly becuase i like starcraft. The begining was ok to say the most. I kept reading it thnking it would get better. When i finished it, i closed the book and threw it against the wall then stompt on it. It didn't follow starcraft at all. The characters were stupid and not the same, the whole story was dumb. Boring! WARNING- read at your own risk of passing out from boredom! If you spent six or seven dollars on this book, you just got done flushing it all down the toilet. Be smart, save your life, don't buy this book. I'm sorry but it stank."
2,Too Short,"Don't purchase this cane if you are 6' or taller. The cane is way too short.Also, the two labels that are glued to the cane are nearly un-removable due to the strong adhesive they are attached with. When you do get the labels off the finish will be marred."
4,A Jewish resistance base in the forests.,"A great book, followed by an OK movie. This book shows that not all Jews gave up the fight when faced with the Nazi forces. Some Jews fled to the forest, where they accumulated guns and food. They mounted resistance to the Germans and their proxy forces. I admire the Bielski Brothers for their courage to face tremedous odds and forces against them. Their courage showed the Nazi forces that not all Jews surrendered meakly.I read this book in one sitting. It is an easy read about human dignity and courage. I also have the other book about this subject called Defiance, and I can't wait to start this book, even though it has a slightly different prospective."
1,Much Ado About Very Little,"Should really be titled the true story of three men who ran away from the Nazis and hid in the woods. Its true that they defied the Nazis but mainly just by staying alive. No mean feat, certainly, and neither is the rescue of 1200 other humans. But as a tale of war, or even resistance, it leaves much to be desired. The story this purports to be remains to be told."
2,Slightly Better Than a Plastic Basin,"This product is only better than buying a cheap plastic basin and filling it with your own warm water for a foot soak. From my experience, the heating element will not even truly keep the water warm (it cooled off within 15 minutes with that turned on), and the massage function is extremely loud and doesn't do much good. The one redeeming quality is the reflexology plates on the bottom -- without those, this would be absolutely useless."
2,Not what I expected,I should have known for the price that it was not what I wanted. Water doesn't stay hot and not much room for your feet. May be ok for someone with very small feet.
5,ahhhhh,this thing is fantastic ! don't see how they can make it so cheap . others with the same things cost up too $100.
3,Overall pretty good value,"The massage feature feels great, but the motor hesitates here and there for a second or two, making me wonder if it's going to last very long (had it two months). The heater works well once it finally kicks in, but if you start out with hot water in the unit, it starts to cool off before the heater really takes effect and warms the water back up.I use it regularly though, especially after long hikes when my feet are toast. It really helps them ""spring back"" and feel great the rest of the day."
4,Foot Spa,It provides basic foot spa for the money. It works well. I wish I could keep temperature at cold weather.
4,Nice looking,I bought for a friend and she loved it. I found it a couple of dolasr more expensive at Wal-Mart so I think I got a good deal.
4,"Good bargain, but LOUD","I love the warming function, the massage, and attachments. It's a great bargain, and it works well. However, I'm worried about upsetting my downstairs neighbors when I use it because the vibrations are strong and this spa foot bath machine is LOUD."
5,yeah,"YES ,i love it thanks to you for selling 1 that i could affordAnd thanks to Amazon for having gift certificatesAs well as thanks to all my surveys sites that help me get thegift certificates................"
1,Can't believe the number of good reviews,"This headset was incredibly disappointing. It does have good noise cancellation for the listener, but for the headset user, the volume was variable and volume controls are difficult to operate while it is in my ear. The earpieces came off almost immediately and were therefore easily lost. It was expensive but cheaply made. Feel ripped off."
4,construction superintendent,"The item has excellent reception, however, Iv'e been having problems with the earbuds. They secure poorly to the unit and I already have lost two earbuds when I remove them from my ear."
1,difficult,"Headset was difficult to use,particularly on/off and volume control. I returned it. also returning proceedure was not user friendly."
5,Flyers flying.,"This an exellent box set of the Philadelphia Flyers Stanley Cup Champions, available at a very good price."
5,Best eye drops for wearing contacts in dry Colorado,I have been using these eye drops for a few years now. They are the best I have come across. I put them in before I put my contacts in and then again at night after I take my contacts out. I have no dry eye problems in the very dry climate of Colorado even after wearing the contacts for over 12 hours. I will buy this product as long as it is made.
5,Sandi Genovese's Three-Dimensional Scrapbooks: Techniques for Building Texture and Style into Your Pages,Great shape and fast shipping. Would buy from again.
3,Story...yeah...,"Talk about a thirty minute ""movie"" that they stretched to an hour ten. This is how I would define this movie: so/so acting, boobies, twenty minutes of watching clips from the previous movie, women slowly get killed somehow (cue excessive gore), one of them gets resurrected as an evil version of itself somehow, vaguely female empowering moment when they beat the ""monster."" This is an all chick flick, so no guy actor to create a forced romance between one character and the other, could have been a good thing.That being said at least the characters were fun if not outright silly, and everyone involved kind of seemed privy to just how silly of a concept this movie is. They played up all the typical B movie cliches. The actors and director seemed to be having fun with it even if they probably threw the script together overnight. It was mildly enjoyable. I'd say rent it, but don't buy it."
3,3.5 for Holmes,"I'm glad that most of you gave this book 4 and 5 stars; but to me, I found that this book was too long and too drawn out to my liking. Yes, ""B-More Careful"" has over 300 pages, but I was totally clued to that book. As for this book, I didn't feel the magic of Shannon Holmes pen in this book. I also got a little bit confused about Corey's age from the time he was introduced to the book up to the end. I know Shannon Holmes is trying to keep it street as much as possible, but for me, I feel that this book and ""Bad Girlz"" were slack ups since ""B-More Careful"" was totally successful. I do agree that this book should be used as summer reading for most urban high schools and college social science courses. But you can be the overall judge of this book if you purchase it or rent it from your library."
5,"Finally a ""relationship"" book that hits us with total truth!","This book is what millions of people need. Instead of pursuing relationships with people, it encourages us to pursue a relationship with God who will bring us our true joy. Then if God willing, we're supposed to be with someone, God will bring them to our lives and we dont have to do anything to make it happen. I believe the author hit the bullseye with his points and its clear that he practices what he has written.This book is also a great tool to have. Its not very long and you can re-read it over and over. This book has impacted my life in such a positive way and I pray that it will impact your life the same. Trust me, its well worth the $8.P.S. I would just like to point out that I believe the amazing author Lord J.E. Falynn is ""Neil"" who you can read about in perhaps the most exciting chapter on relationships you'll ever read"
3,LIVE Nails,"The Nine Inch Nails live DVD- And All That Could Have been is a good effort. Trent Reznor brings his exciting enthusiasm to this production but leaves out many worthy songs such as The Fragile, Burn, the Perfect Drug, and We're in This Together. Also despite And All that Could Have Been's double disc length the DVD for the most part only includes the Fragility Version 2.0 concert. DVD extras such as videos, and behind the scenes footage are oddly absent. Despite this the positives definitely outshine the negatives. The pluses on ALTCHB include fantastic sound quality, good live performances, a long concert and a sharp picture. If you're a serious NIN fan this DVD is for you!"
3,Could have been better,"The sound quality of this DVD is excellent. The concert footage itself is okay - a bit grainy and too many of the scenes were shot from far back in the audience. I'm perplexed by the decision to make this a 2-disc set that splits the concert in half. The concert is only about 90 minutes long, so it should easily have been able to fit on 1 disc. Overall, I wish I had just gotten the CD. This DVD is great to listen to, but there's not much to look at. U2's Elevation Tour DVD is far superior to this one: comparably excellent sound, far superior video & stage presence, more extras, and the entire concert fits on 1 disc (with extras on the second)."
5,WOW!,"WHAT A FANTASTIC SET. GREAT SONG SELECTIONS, BUT I WISH THAT THE DAY THE WORLD WENT AWAY WAS INCLUDED. EXTRAS ARE SLIGHTLY GENERIC AND I CAN'T SEE WHY IT IS ON TWO DISCS(EXTRAS ARE MULTIPLE ANGLES OF 3 SONGS, A LOT OF STILL PICTURES, AND AUDIO COMMENTARY FROM THE DIRECTOR OF THE VIDEOS THAT ARE SHOWN PROJECTED BEHIND THE BAND FOR 3 SONGS). ALL OF IT COULD HAVE FIT ON ONE DISC. IT IS AN ENERGETIC AND ECLECTIC SET THAT REALLY MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE THERE. THE DVD INSERT SAYS THAT THIS WAS ASSEMBLED BY THE BAND FROM VIDEOS SHOT AT DIFFERENT CONCERTS , BUT THE CREDITS OF THE DISC LIST A DIRECTOR. IF TRENT REALLY PUT THIS ALL TOGETHER, IT IS TRULY A COMPLETE VISION BY AN ARTIST OF HIS WORK IN TOTAL. KUDOS!"
5,"Great DVD, Shocking Price!!! Stop the rot!!!","5 stars for the concert content, 1 star for extras, 0 for the price. Other reviews listed here (mostly) are accurate about how good this concert is, so read it there. I just want to say that we have to let the companies (not Amazon, it's nothing to do with them) that are getting very greedy about DVD prices know that it is UNACCEPTABLE. The ONLY reason this is on two discs is so that they can try to justify ripping us off!! This disc is actually WORSE OFF by being on two discs. The recent U2 offering (also a great concert) was also an example of a radically overblown initial price. Vote with your dollars, people, do anything you can to avoid paying top price for these DVD's to send a message that really needs to be sent."
3,Do you people not have ears???,"I didnt read all 110 reviews, so I dont know if anyone pointed this out already. (If not, shame on you children for being such superfans to blindly praise this DVD). I say this, because I for one...was extremely dissapointed that the vocals are dubbed on this DVD. Did none of you notice this dissapointing fact? That....is a slap in the face to NIN fans around the world. What was he thinking? How on earth could I feel the same way about him, after this? But wait a sec....keep in mind this was the same guy who was boo`ed off the stage years ago at the first lalapalooza for having his lead vocals pre-recorded. So shame on me for being so surprised. Trent is great in the studio. However, anyone who has seen him live (those shows where is really is singing)....know that he is far from being a talented vocalist. Quite the opposite, in fact."
1,useless book,"We tried to play several card games described in this book. Unfortunately the directions are so incomplete that we were unable to play the game. It is very frustrating becuase the description of the game was very interesting and made us want to play, but we just couldnt figure out how to play. This happened for several different games - enough that we just stopped using the book. There are a lot of game books out there - buy a different one."
4,Annie Oakley,"Annie is very cute, but the picture shows her with braids in her hair and her hair came straight. The braids would have been a nice touch."
3,Good,"This book contained a very well crafted world. It was a good book except that I could predict everything that was about to happen. This book was written for young teens, it is not worth it if you are over 18."
4,I don't understand,"what is with all the negative reviews. Yes this book follows some fairly cookie cutter fantasy magician guidelines. You know what so do 90%+ of all the other fantasy books out there. I would not judge a book solely on that.The first book starts off ok but takes a while to really get you in. Once I was engrossed I read the other two books in three days. They hit a climax and stayed there throughout the whole book. The books do not slow down for 100 pages while filling you in with lots of un-needed background information, future plot set-up, and side plots like a few certain ""big names"" in fantasy have been doing.I found the books well written and extremely entertaining, the characters pulled you in and made you wonder what was going to happen next. If you love fantasy and are not one of the closed minded people who think unless a book is as complex as something l;ike Steven Erikson's Malazan Book of the Fallen series you will enjoy this series."
2,Disappointing on all levels,"I stayed very optimistic while reading this book, but after a while of forcing myself to turn page after page, i realized there was no reward for my patience...and the reasons for my disappointment arrive on all levels; unlikeable characters, very slow pace and worst of all, the author paints absolutely no visual picture of the setting, along with a bland style of writing. Adjectives are too often repeated and the vocabulary of this novel feels severely limited. This may have been done to make this book a quick, easy read but the level of simplicity is astonishingly severe.This book lacks everything required to make a good fantasy novel; imagination, engaging prose, exciting adventure and richly painted characters and setting."
1,Good for a teen-age girl....unless she has taste.,"This book was just so sappy and slow that I could hardly finish it. I have read A LOT of fantasy and this is just weak stuff. I suppose that it's great for someone who doesn't enjoy serious content, but this read more like a teen-age girls diary and the heroine was so ridiculous that I won't be reading the rest...."
3,Australian SF Reader,"This is set in a world, or at least a city, in this case, where magic is the province of the wealthy and well connected, and those with talent and cash can be trained to become powerful.So, of course, the heroine here is a poor kid, and a girl, at that, who seems to have more than just a little aptitude for this sort of thing. Along with a friend with a talent for the Thieves Guild, instead of magic, they get into more than a little trouble."
1,Big miss,"Don't get me wrong, I love fantasy trilogies. But this was dreadful: trite, boring, poorly written. The characterization is lamentably bad. A big disappointment."
3,OK for teens,"I just read the first book, but I bought all three at once so I'll probably read the whole thing.Back when I was 12-15 I would have enjoyed the story as the standard plot elements of this novel would have been new to me back then. But for my adult tastes it was a bit too much like Enid Blyton meets Harry Potter.There was one jarring scene in the book which I didn't find at all believable. When Cery is persuaded to pop in to a building and murder someone whom his mentor at the Thieves' Guild wants out of the way. In just two or three paragraphs of brief conversation Cery goes from anguishing over whether he could ever do such a thing, to pulling his knives out with a cheerful smile. And then he never gives it a second thought after that; it doesn't seem to change his attitude or outward behaviour. He's a thief and now a murderer with a heart of gold and boy-next-door demeanour. Not convincing for me."
2,Tired and uninvolving,"I picked this book up while on vacation on a recommendation from a bookstore employee. That was a mistake. The pacing is awful. The author takes the entire first half of the book to set up the plot (which is fairly thin anyway, and shouldn't take one quarter of that amount to set into motion). If the characters had been explored and expanded, that time would have been well spent. Unfortunately, the characters seem flat and unengaging throughout the book.This novel feels like a short story that has been padded unmercifully into a much longer work. I certainly will not pick up the sequels."
3,Enjoyable.,"I enjoyed this novel. It is the author's first work, and has the feel of a debut novel. Though the writing seems a little unpolished in places, it is on the whole, well written, and will keep the reader nicely entertained from beginning to end. The characters are likeable, but on the downside, the book is a little predictable. It's fairly obvious how it will resolve. In fact, were it not for the sinister discovery that a character is up to no good, I don't know if I'd read it again. However, I am interested to see how the main character progresses, what the villain is actually up to, and I'd like to see the characters again, so I look forward to reading the other two books in the series. However, as no one seems in a hurry to release them on to audio, I doubt I'll get my chance.Richard Aspell is a good narrator, and makes the audio book a pleasant listening experience."
3,"Decent, but not gripping","I was excited to read a more down-to-earth, un-sensationalized book with magic - but perhaps Trudy took it too far. This book is very real, but its slower pace and lack of real drama leaves you searching for more. The story's great, and because of this I plan to at least look a the sequels."
5,Cheer for the little guy (or gal),"The underdog gives it to the powers that be.Sonea tries to stay out of trouble, yes she has some friends on the shady side, but she has stayed clear of them for awhile. Then comes the purge, where the poor are cast out of the inner city, if that wasn't bad enough, an arrogant magician makes a snide comment about her and her friends, her people...well usually rocks don't make it through the magician's shield, but what if one did? what if that rock hit the arrogant sob magician in the head?Although this story is part of a trilogy its a good read on its own, but if you are like me you will want to own all three before begining, as waiting feverishly for the next book can be torture.I am a lover of good fantasy stories and this trilogy is one of them."
3,Disappointment,"This book as a strong opening and I had high hopes for the first few chapters. Then the plot got stuck. I suddenly realized was reading a scene almost identical to a scene from the previous chapter. There is chase scene after chase scene after chase scene, one very similar to the one before. More of the same, over and over again. And I didn't find myself caring about the characters very much. The writing was fairly good, but not above average. I plowed through it, but won't read the next book in the series."
2,Unfinishable,"I have to admit at the outset that I haven't finished the book. I read the first 70 pages or so, hoping that it would get interesting, but it hasn't. The characters are bland and nearly identical; I had an extremely hard time telling them apart. The dialogue tends to do the bare minimum job of conveying plot information without having much wit or spark. Plot, magic system, and setting alike seemed disappointingly generic. Avoid."
2,Probably a good children's book,This is not a book for adult readers. The characters all seemed flat. They all used the same simple vocabularies and simple sentence structures. Their motivations in life were simple and predictable. There are good guys and bad guys. Many real people are more complex than that. The book is 465 pages but probably should have been edited down to 50 to 100.
4,Couldn't put it down,"I really liked this book. While I agree with some of what other reviewers noted about the predictability of the plot and the ""fantasy staples"" included in this book, I loved the characters and wanted to see what happened to them next. I don't have time to read as much as I would like (although I have an audio book going in the car at all times), but I read this book in one weekend. I had picked The Magician's Guild up at the bookstore on a whim, but have ordered the next two in the trilogy and can't wait for them to arrive.Perhaps the storyline is a little juvenile as one reviewer noted, but I must be a child at heart, as I can't wait to read the next in the series."
2,A book about training - no action involved,"This book is good at only one thing - setting u the next novel - there is very little action and the book is simply put as this - without major spoilers - the 1st half, there is a girl, she has magic, we must train her, she is hiding - and the second half - she is training - she debates staying - her ONE friend is worried - there is little intrigue (and I do mean only a little) and then the story is over - what is the point of this novel you ask? - it is to set up the next book apparently because this is the biggest yawn fest for me to read this year - no, no, and very much no"
3,Not what it used to be,"I Own a granite shop and we used to get a year out of these grinders but now 2 months if we are lucky. I talked with a repair guy and they have different colored labels and he said certain colors are not worth rebuilding. I have about 50 of these that are broken. on the other hand ALL of the manufacturers don't hold up well including Dewalt, Milwaukee, etc... Granite is tough but 5 years on one grinder (previous post ) no way with today's quality in my business. They have changed to cheaper parts or something because these are not what they use to be. so instead of buying them every six months I am buying them 4-6 a month. great for Makita but bad for the consumer. I will find a replacement. I am just disgusted with Makita.John, Piney Flats Tn."
5,"Better taste, works great","Much better taste than the orange flavor. I have been using this stuff off and on for almost a year now, and have not really gotten sick at all. With a new baby and two other kids in the house all getting colds and what not, that is really something.The price is about one third what the stores here charge, the only problem is that Amazon no longer will ship grocery items to Alaska, so I can not get any more..."
1,Looks good but not very comfy!!,"I bought a pair of this stool because it looks good, not very comfortable and it hurts my lower back. Let me know if anybody wants to buy mine, still looks new since nobody sits on it."
4,Delivered as promised,They came quick. Put together easily. No tools needed. They look good. They work the way they are supposed to and are comfortable. If there was anything to say for improvement and this is just a nit picky minor...it would be to put more padding on the back bar. I buy a lot online and feel this is right up there with the purchases where I feel I got my money's worth and no buyer's remorse.
4,Great gaming chair,"I got this set to be used as gaming chairs. The kids love how they go up and down. They're very comfortable with the back and foot rest, but do not have good stability on carpet."
3,Poetic essay,"This book consists of a long personal essay about Palestinian identity which follows the author's thoughts as he reacts to a series of photographs (mostly from 1979) taken by Jean Mohr. It is not a memoir, although the author relates a few early memories of his parents' lives in Palestine and of the arrival of Palestinian refugees in Cairo, where he was living with his family 1948. Mostly, the book focuses on the injustice of a people whose homeland has been violently take away and what it means to be a nation in exile. The photographs are very poignant; it would have been nice to see them in greater detail, but most of them are rather small to accommodate the long text."
3,Old Program,"The content is very good as others have said, but the program looks like it was written 10 years ago. Kind of Klunky."
1,Not my first choice!,"This book starts off well enough, but the plot is un-realistic, even farther than I'm ready to go. The story drags in the middle, and it's easy to lose interest. Plus, the more time you spend with the heroine, the less you like her because of her continuous complaints. Had I been the hero, I'd have left her in the ""ring of fire."""
2,Good Actors Don't Necessarily Make Good Novelists,"I love Alan Cumming as an actor and really wanted to love this book. I really didn't.I put this down and felt like I had just read a book version of Showtime's ""Queer as Folk"". A protagonist with a Peter Pan complex who is entirely motivated by his crotch. A suporting cast of gays and straights who chide said protagonist for being such a child.Drugs, drugs, and more drugs.Oh and lots and lots of sex, and a growing desire to be a father amidst all this?!So much of the book is told in a near stream of consciousness that at times is, well grating. I felt like I was reading someone's melodramatic and not very interesting journal entries. By the end I wanted to slap Tommy across the face and tell him to grow up. Maybe that was the point."
4,Nice.,"I really enjoyed this book. It made me think of my younger days. Granted, I think the sexual details could have given us more details, but hey, it was still a real pleasure to read. I highly recommend this one."
4,"Arived late, but in good condition","I ordered my book on november 18th and didn't get it until december 18th. other than that, the book arrived in great condition!as for the book itself, it is WONDERFUL! not everyone's taste, obviously. there are two or three sexual scenes that go into extreme detail and a lot of drug references. With that said, i read it for the first time in middle school. i was able to handle it, but for most people i would say AT LEAST 15 before someone would be old enough to handle it. it also has many gay and lesbian scenes. however it is the most amazing book. it is so well written and i think that anyone even the least bit interested should read it."
4,Good set made better it you get the pervious set to go with it,"Hit me with your 80's Box! (Hip-O records - 3 CD set): While this is a very fine, and very entertaining, collection of 80's hits, there was certainly room here for more than 14 songs a disc (in fact, they could have put all of this on 2 discs). However, the selections of songs are very good. This is a pop set and it does not represent the emerging Rap music of the era, which may be a plus or minus depending on your view on Rap music. This is a Good set, which can be made much better if you buy their previous 3 CD set that Hip-O titled ""I Want My 80's Box!"" Together, these made a superb collection.Four Stars for this set (Five Stars for the combination of this and their previous set)."
4,Great First Guitar!,"Picked up this guitar for my 12 year old daughter to learn how to play. She loves the color and is able to handle the full size. I would prefer the steel strings, but for someone starting out, the nylon strings are a bit easier on the fingers. You can hardly go wrong-- price AND style!"
5,I Love These Icaros....,One of my favorite collections of Ayahuasca icaros. I highly reccomend this cd to anyone interested in this medicine and the music that surrounds these ceremonies. Blessings to all.
4,all in all a good movie,"There are two reasons I gave this movie four stars instead of five.The dubbing and the music.There was a part in the movie where Jiro and Otuki were talking to each other and there mouths weren't moving.As for the music,it didn't suit the mood at all.Jiro's adoptive mother and sister get killed and the townspeople think he did it so they chase him.During the chase the are playing a rock tune.That would of been quite a sad seen if they hadn't placed the music the way they did.Other than that the movie was really good.Long (133 min.)but good. Due to the violence which is not graphic but may be disturbing for kids younger than 10.It also contains one seen of breif nudity you might want to watch out for.I'm 11 years old and I really liked this movie."
1,Doesn't Work,I bought 2 of these traps and they've been in the hot house about a month and there are zero mosquitoes in the traps. That is especially disappointing since I had bought these on recommendations on drugstore dot com from people also in Hawaii. But those reviews from 2004 are for a different product from what I got. It used to come with a separate pheromone and a cross tube to put the lure on and now there is no cross tube and all the solid items in a packet gets dumped into the water.What I have found that DOES work is from a youtube video for a $1 mosquito bag fan trap. I bought a box fan and made the bag from tulle cloth I got at Walmart and that bag is full of all sorts of flying bugs and it started working immediately. I sometimes stand behind the fan to act as a lure and then shoo the mosquitoes into the fan and bag. Do yourselves a big favor and make one or more of these!
5,Dremel 785 9.6 Volt MultiPro Battery Pack Worth the Wait,"The pack works great, so does the rotary tool. Not much to say; it's a battery pack after all. Amazon, however, is worthy of some words here... it is one of the best on-line shopping experiences I have had in years."
5,The Ron Clark Story,"What a fantastic movie and worth every cent I paid for it. Matthew Perry was beyond great as Ron Clark. It was one on the greatest movies I have every seen. I would have given it more than 5 stars if I could have. Although the whole movie was super, one of my favorite scenes was when Ron learned to double dutch just to gain the confidence of his students (which by the way he actually did learn to double dutch). I thought Stand and Deliver, Lean on Me and Take the Lead were exceptional movies but this one was one step up from those. Knowing that this was based on a true story and Matthew's acting sure brings it to the top. I have watched it many times since I purchased it and will continue to do so. It is well worth seeing."
1,The Ron Clark Story,"I ordered a DVD ""The Ron Clark Story"" on August 23, 2011 and we just recently watched the video. It was very dark and very hard to see most of the scenes.It is an excellent movie, but we were very disappointed in the quality of the video."
1,Scratched!,"The movie was scratched and when I was showing it to my class, it stopped right in the most dramatic part. I was very disappointed."
4,The Ron Clark Story,"This was a good purchase, a family rated film to share with everyone. Matthew Perry did a good job in this film."
2,Garbage!,"It will work if you walk within 10 feet from it, then what's the use might as well just flip the switch yourself. Get the ""Long Ranger III"" instead, you'll love it."
3,1 out of 2 works,"One control works perfectly. The other does not work at all, even with a new battery. As long as one control is working, it's not worth being without the control to return it. It is a disappointment though."
1,Republican party propaganda?,"This book appears to be nothing more than a Republican/Administration attempt at politicizing the tragedy of 9/11. If you were to flip through the pictures, you would think the only politicians responding to the tragedy were President Bush and Rudolph Juliani."
5,Authentic Girl Group Sounds I,"Wait a minute! Was that a new ""girl group"" song or do I remember hearing it in 1963? I'm telling you that you're correct! You won't believe your ears when listening to this Rochester, NY based band. This is not an ""oldies"" group. It's My Party is a band that sings and plays songs (both tasty covers and many originals) in the ""girl group"" style, just like thousands of bands yearning to sound like the Kingsmen reproduce that sound. This band captures the feel of the genre with their original songs, containing arrangements to satisfy any purist. If you think they might be just a studio concoction, take my advice and RUN . . . don't walk to hear them live! The band comes with horns, vibes . . . everything to get that sound! Their praises have been sung by members of veteran girl groups like the Cookies, Toys, Jaynetts, Fashions, Shangri-Las and Raindrops! Check it out!"
2,Dremel Rotary Saw,The Dremel Rotary Saw is a great tool. It arrived without an instruction book and the tools that go with Dremel were stuck in the case.
3,Above all,"Make sure you mount this on a block of wood mounted onto 2 studds. It has a tendency to lean to one side or the other. I have my 2@ 26 inch LCDs on the bedroom walls. I bought them because I was tired of the struggle to plug in accessories. That was a plus. But unless you can drill out the holes on the mounting and install with larger bolt/screws I'd pass on 26 to 30"" standard TV mounting."
4,Very nice,"Much like her last album 'Beautiful Collision' in sound, but the songwriting is a little more adventurous. This album exudes a confidence and sophistication that makes it all seem so easy for her, which could lead some listeners to find it a little understimulating."
3,not as impressed with the author,My personel opinion is I was not completely satisfied with the author and her intake on this book. Im sure that this author will be very good for some. Just not my taste
5,Beyond Blessed!,"Wow! I love this study. There are a group of ladies in my church doing this one right now and it has been awesome. For a summer Bible Study, we have maintained a high attendance. This is my first study with Beth and I have to admit, it was hard. There is a lot of scripture reading and some pretty in depth questions. I wouldn't let that intimidate you. If you can't handle the written material, the videos that follow the end of each week will bless you beyond imagination. I have laughed, cried and seen the work of the Holy Spirit both in myself and with the members of our group. I highly recommend this study!"
1,The Worst Sound Quality On a Disc!,"No! This is not the greatest Firebird on a disc! The conductor is so unknown, I thought this was a Herbert Von Karajan student or even an Alexander rahbari student conducting but it isn't. This is some guy I've never heard of named Dmitry Kitajenko. Ignore the reviews the other 2 Josh Rappaports wrote. I get bored with the slow pacing. Take either Stravinsky's own recording with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra, Kent Nagano's recording with the London Symphony Orchestra, or Pierre Boulez's recording with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. This is one sedated recording. The only piece I like here is Le Chant du Rossignol! That's the piece which saves the disc from bad sound quality"
1,Worthless,These were a waste of money. I've used Contech before and within days they were filled with moths. I've had numerous strips of this brand up for 3 weeks now and caught all of 2 moths.
1,These pantry moth traps really don't work.,"I was very disappointed in these SpringStar pantry moth traps. The pheromone attractant didn't -- attract, that is. The pantry moths simply didn't flock to them and I found very few pantry moths in them, compared to the number still evident everywhere BUT the moth traps."
3,It didn't suck.,"Good cops and criminals fight to keep bad cops from taking over a closed down police precinct on New Year's Eve. The action is good, but the actors have no real chemistry together so it comes across as flat.Also, most of the characters are either criminals or bad cops posing as good cops (although it is obvious) and therefore there isn't really anybody to cheer for.Still, a good no brainer movie."
3,Why this was made...and whether it is worth seeing,"WHY THEY MADE IT:1. THe original Assault on Precinct 13 was made in 1976 so there might be a fair number of people out there who hadn't seen the original, many of them age 30 or under (a desirable demographic)2. The formula worked the first time around and Hollywood likes proven successes.IS IT WORTH SEEING?:1. For fans of Ethan Hawke, definitely.Credible work.2. For everyone else, rent or buy the first movie before you see this one. If the subject matter interests you ( a precinct being shut down and attacked by bad guys), you might want to take a look at the remake because there are enough differences to hold your attention."
2,Should have been closer to Newman's Fort Apache,"Laurence Fishburne was the one who carried this movie in my opinion. His screen screen presence was the change in the ambiance of the film. The other actors, although playing to part didn't do so as convincingly as Fishburne.The contrivance of the police assaulting the precinct being partners in crime with Fishburne could have had at least a little back story to help us understand why cops would do such a thing. Yes, it's obvious these cops aren't straight, but why aren't they? Why do we have to wait for Fisburne's character to tell us after enough shooting to make the OK corral seem like a B-B gun fight?Old Timer"
2,Misses,"Everyone has pretty much covered the credibility problems here. No cell phones, no communication ability of any kind in the 21st century? The woods and CGI snow, etc. While it is true that Carpenter's original was a take on the John Wayne western, Rio Bravo, it should also be noted that Carpenter was trying to say something about urban fear and paranoia (sp?) at the time. You didn't have to be a cultural anthropologist to see that the faceless gang symbolized the rampant fear of street crime at the time. Remember old Charles Bronson in the original Death Wish anyone? Instead here we have a cast with recognizable stars and a script that gives a few of them a chance to say a few interesting ""cool"" things and yeah, there is high tech gunfire galore. Problem is, it takes just the trappings of the original to give us what we can find in any other actioner. Anyway. Enough for now."
2,Weak and unbelievable story,"The whole story is so senseless and weak, it just tries to keep the movie running. Basically, this movie could have been ended after 5mins..."
5,Furnace heat inducer Blower,"Well when you look it up it says for a water heater, but it was for my furnace. Long story short this motor was $285 at the lowest price I could find locally. Obviously I got on Amazon and bought one through CSH for $189 including taxes.. This was the exact replacement of the one that went bad. It works just fine and got me back in business. Also thanks to grayfurnaceman on youtube that pointed me in the right direction on how to repair my furnace myself. CSH was a good retailer and delivered the motor in a timely manner."
