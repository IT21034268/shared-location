4,"Merry Christmas, but I think I'll miss this one this year.","This is the second Christmas CD compiled by Dr. Demento. Most of the best known Christmas novelty songs are on hisfirst Christmas CD, so this one isn't quite as good as that one. But there are a lot of funny lesser know songs here. In addition to Christmas, there are two songs each about Hanukkah and New Year's. Fans of mad music and crazy comedy should enjoy this CD."
5,A Good One,"I bought this book based on how many times I saw it on different people's Recommended Reading lists. I've read slowly through the first two chapters so far, because the book is rich with things I haven't heard before and is very beneficial. It's already directly impacted my life and I look forward to reading the rest, one chapter at a time."
2,"Just get MK Trilogy for PSX,N64 or Sega Saturn","This game is basically just an upgrade to Mortal Kombat 3.It brings back some old characters that were not in MK3.Such as Scorpion,Reptile,Kitana,Jade...as well as a few new ones such as Rain and Ermac.The Sega Genesis port and The SNES ports were kinda bland.It's been awhile since I played this game,but from what I can remember,there were some missing elements to this.I think Sheeva was missing,Animalalities were taken out,and a few backgrounds were gone too.Also with this Genesis version,you will also need a six button pad to play it.Like with MK3.Unless you wanna put yourself through the torcher of using a three button controller.My best advice would be to just leave UMK3 alone and pick up Mortal Kombat Trilogy for another system instead.It's got everything this game has and more.Only buy this,if you are a die hard Genesis collector,or if you don't own a Playstation,Nintendo 64 or a Sega Saturn."
5,"Oodles of Outstanding Hints, Tips, and Antidotes","Amazing Antidotes is packed with numerous techniques (many that are very easy and simple to try) for multitudes of aches, pains, illnesses and health concerns. I especially found the sections on headaches/migraines, stomach aches, hot flashes, colds/flu, and indigestion/heartburn to be helpful. This book explains many of the theories behind conditions, and offers an assortment of antidotes that have been used (some for 100s of years) to remedy the situation. It is an excellent resource for people who appreciate the body's natural ability to heal itself, and desire holistic healing approaches and natural remedies."
5,Enter the World of the Grotesque!,"You want evil? Chills? Supernatural? Then this is the book for you! The well-developed characters and grotesque details bring this story to life....drawing a fine line between imaginary and reality. There's just the right amount of everything in this book, from teasing romance to action to manipulation to abominable behavior. A definite read for those who enjoy horror, fantasy, and/or mystery....and perhaps all the other genres too!"
3,beware of the cult,"a good read. well enoug story. some good details, and some great descriptions. i'm keeping mine. but on the other hand, the story isn't better than that. an evil cult doing evil things. a relationship building (always interesting to read some irrelevant romance in a horror story, right?). all done in a little too naive way. not great (except at times), but good."
2,I feel like he is rambling...,"It's more like reading a medical study, with very emphatic and descriptive moments, than an typical diet/health book. He does a great job at illustrating how the sick do not need to be force fed."
1,Wrong kind of book for me,"I was looking to study caloric restriction and intermittent fasting when I found this book, and it's religious approach just let me down. The lack of book description and slightly misleading title don't help."
3,Ozzy Osbourne,I think this book was good but the author could have told the story better. I do recommend this book it is a good one but you will want to know that it does say stuff about drugs.
2,"The author has an affection for Holmes, but....","The author has a clear affection for Holmes, yet these stories are not particularly well-written. Holmes is the most interesting of fictional characters, but the author puts him through some very familiar paces. Normally when I get a new Holmes pastiche I read it that day...I started this one and it has been sitting on my shelf for weeks. It's worth having if you collect pastiches, probably not otherwise."
4,exactly what you might expect,Still learning the best ways to use this brown sugar variety. A few of the plastic packages cracked open in transit but that 's probably to be expected and the brown sugar is a very hardened item already-- so no biggie.
4,Nice mats,"These mats looks great and cover a lot of the floor carpet. Only complaints are that the molded fit is not perfect (slight wrinkle in the middle-upper, side) and the plastic caps that cover the screw-downs pop off very easily."
5,"Protect your floor from dirt, water, & snow","If you live anywhere that has dirt, water or snow these are the mats for you. They are carpeted and generally match your OEM carpet. You can hose them off too. I have had several sets and just got this set for the Grand Cherokee I picked up. The cost is also great here on Amazon."
1,A sickening read,"I`m sure no reader will rate this review as helpful - negative reviews are never appreciated. But this is a very boring read, and makes the stabbing out to be the only remarkable event in Seles` life. There is plenty of wallowing in selfpity. Understandable about the stabbing, but the objections to her grunting, deaths of people in her life and every other bridge she has ever crossed in her life are written in meticulous detail so the reader is left in no doubt about what a hard life Seles has had.I used to like Monica Seles before I read this book, but this nauseating read made me think otherwise. It is deservedly out of print."
4,Fun Songs & Comedic Commentary,"We have 3 of the 'Elvira' collections & our favorites are Haunted Hits & Revenge of Monster Hits. The light-hearted songs have been great background music at our Halloween parties & while decorating.We like Revenge of the Monster Hits the best but enjoy the tremendous variety of songs on Haunted Hits.I don't disagree with other reviewers regarding the songs on this CD or Elvira's cheesy commentary. However, year after year this CD puts me in the mood for decorating and the party more than the others we've bought. We use the Martha Stewart Spooky Scary sounds to pipe outside but its not really fun to listen to..."
4,Outback Fire by Margaret Way,"Description from the book back cover:Woman in a man's world ... Tempestuous Storm McFarland had declared open war on her rival, Luke Branagan, her father's adopted son. Luke was the one being groomed to handle the vast family cattle empire and this had ultimately driven Storm away from Winding River. She would find recognition and a new life in the city. Still, she longed for her life in the Outback. So when Luke insisted she visit her ailing father, she agreed to go. Only to discover that her powerful feelings for this commanding usurper had subtly shifted from hurt anger to intense desire ..."
3,Bliss,"Easy to install. Web support a bit difficult. Great new technology. A bit expensive. To use it properly you need time as it is based on meditation. Not for fast action gamers, more for if you want to relax and do self help."
1,Not compatible with Quicktime 7.,"The information written in the system requirements above is wrong. Wild Divine: Wisdom Quest will NOT run on a Windows computer running Quicktime 7 (the current version of quicktime). This means that if you use any application that requires Quicktime 7, such as iTunes, or have Quicktime Pro, Wisdom Quest will not run on your system.We have been informed that they are currently working on the issue, but can't give a timeline for when it will be resolved.As it stands now, unless you are willing to limit your system to an old version of Quicktime, with no guarantee that you will ever be able to use Wisdom Quest on a updated computer system, you will probably not want to purchase this product."
2,Disappointed.,"I have collected quotes for over 30 yrs. and found my own collection much more inspirational. I really resented that after you read the quote, the author added his own idea/interpretation/direction below many of the quotes. I found that to be irritating and it interferred with my own thoughts concerning the quote. The cover is a turn off..a cell phone? What were they thinking? Buy yourself an exquisite journal and start collecting your own quotes. You'll enjoy it much more."
4,As good as a plastic reel can be,"Okay, it's plastic. I've had three of these, and bought this latest to replace one that had a broken mounting plate. The other two have had no problem beyond disassembling to apply fresh lubricant to the O-rings. There may be more well-built metal reels out there, but at the price for this reel, I'm content to use them until they break beyond repair, and then replace with an identical model (no need to re-drill mounting holes in a brick wall)."
3,functional ... though a bit flimsy,"I've had my Suncast reel (SWA100) about 10 years (received it as a B-day gift from father-in-law), and though it lasted till this summer (wall mount bracket broke into pieces just last week {06/11}), I had frequent trouble with minor dripping leaks. I could usually get it to behave for a few weeks if I replaced the o-ring (on the spindle where the reel mounts) and gooped it up real thick with some Vaseline petroleum jelly. I'd do this three or four times each summer and then store the reel in the basement for the winter. I think I got the 10-year life out of it because I did store the reel in the winter, but that constant beating of ultra violet rays and freezing weather on the wall mount all winter finally did it in. You know what though, for less than thirty bucks, I'm ordering another. If I get another 10 years, I'll be quite content and happy. I'd have given this product a 4-star rating if I hadn't needed to spend so much time fixing the leaks. : )"
2,Does not live up to the Amish Heritage,"I was disappointed in this cookbook. Some recipes seem to be authentic. Many were not. I though I'd see some of the very things Lewis writes about in her novels. Very few. I went from cover to cover to mark things I wanted to try, and I only had 3 recipes in the whole book. This one will stay on the shelf, sadly, collecting dust."
2,Not authentic Amish cooking!,"Oh, no no NO. I had such high hopes for this cookbook, and I'm so glad I checked it out from the library before purchasing it. I was looking for a good, old fashioned cookbook with ""made from scratch"" recipes, and this is most definitely not that. The very first recipe in the cookbook called for canned refried beans and salsa from the jar. The first ingredient in the fritter recipe is dry pancake mix, the blueberry pie recipe includes no actual fresh or frozen blueberries, just cans of blueberry pie filling, and other recipes include things such as canned soups and miracle whip. I'm sure Beverly Lewis is a good novelist, but I'm sorry, this cookbook is awful."
3,far from the real story,"This was already clear in the second set, but now it seems even worse, the story has hardly anything to do with Christie's books. Though I do like this Miss Marple, I wished they would stick more to the books."
1,Ship what ever is handy,"For Christmas I ordered a New England Patriots sweatshirt for my grand son and paid the extra cost to have the item expedited.It arrived in a couple of days and I immediately opened it and found a Rams shirt.I called the toll free customer service number on the package and was told when ever they run out of a requested item they ship anything to complete the order.What a way to run a business,I would not recommend this site."
3,"Built-In, North American Style.","This book does have enough pictures of built in cabinets/furniture from every room in the house to give you an idea of what can be done, but I found that other books I have read, such as Kitchen Design books, have way more information on certain topics than this book is able to cover. There is also some instructions on how to make some of the cabinets yourself. The style is all North American which is ok, but you should also read some books on how the Japanese design built in furniture, such as, Small Spaces: Stylish Ideas for Making More of Less in the Home, by Azby Brown."
3,"Basic ideas, some techniques, old furniture","I bought this to get some design ideas for some things I want to build.Liked the theory behind the books ( techniques and workarounds for design/installation problems), unfortunately the actual built-ins portrayed in the pictures are a little bit old.If you filter those images and read mostly the design recommendations and build techniques it is a good book."
2,Just some nice pictures,"Lots of terrific ideas if I owned a million dollar home, but hardly applicable to simple housing with less than expansion rooms."
3,It's just ok,"I loved That's Entertainment! and had the 8 track for it. Yes, I've dated myself but so be it! Decided I needed the CD and hubby and I did the research. I should have listened to the other reviews. There is a ton of music with this box set but it's not the music I was familiar with. Seems that some is missing and lot's of unremarkable songs are added.If you are a purist, do the research and get what you know. If you want to experiment, then get this."
1,BORING,"Shedaisy does NOT have the staying power. In a few years everyone will be saying ""Shedaisy WHO?"" Their music is very forgettable!"
1,Knock On The Sky was Knocked Out!,"SheDaisy vs. Dixie ChicksAnd I only bring this up since SheDaisy were the ones to have claimed to have enough talent and power to blow the Chicks away with this new album, Knock on the Sky.The boxing match lasted a total of 3 or 4 weeks. Here's why:Releasing this album the same season as the Chick's new album was a bad move. Not only did the Chicks' album outsell KNOCK ON THE SKY by astronomical amounts, but this album hasn't even generated a Top 10 single since it's initial release (which was a few weeks before the Chicks released their new album)!The Chicks went back to their Bluegrass roots, while SheDaisy spun into a very obscurly self-defined pop-country, which at times, doesn't even sound country. Nothing wrong with that.. however, their choice to cross over puts them up to the pop-artists, to whom they are left in the dust.Better luck next time, Osborns. I didn't care for this release much, and neither have the radio stations. Back to the drawing board!"
2,poor design,"The swivel/rotating section is limited because they are not using a sphere for the male section. It is like trying to have a square fit in a circle. This poor design limits the movement of where you can point your light or heat source. The male section should have been sphere in design, just as the female section. I am not sure if the assembler ran out of the correct parts and decided to use spare parts. Nevertheless, I was forced to swap out the incorrect part with a lamp I purchased from homedepot."
3,Book is more for Beginners,This book was somewhat of a let down for me since I thought it would focus more on intermediate/advanced digital character design techniques using Photoshop CS. Most of the book is aimed for the beginner (or pre-beginner). However there are a few usefully chapters near the end for more advance graphic professionals.
4,It's Good But...,"This film version of Dylan Thomas's Christmas story is very good. BUT...the audio recording read by the author is truly an aural pleasure! Also, years ago I saw a TV production of this story by the National Theater for the Deaf that was beyond words. Please contact them and encourage them to make this simple, stunning, and (in my opinion) superior presentation available."
5,A Christmas Tradition,"My husband and I watch this every holiday season; a beautiful rendition of a beautiful story-poem. The little boy is spot-on, and the singing aunt and laughing uncles just make the season for me. Lovely."
4,Christmas classic!,"This excellent Christmas classic is very evocative of a young boy's Christmas ""back in the day."" Don't miss this cozy, clean, family-friendly film!"
5,A Real Christmas Sleeper!,"Saw this about 15 years ago on PBS. Lovely, nostalgic film based on Dylan Thomas' poem. Well worth buying. Glad I found it here."
5,I have been searching for this!,This is a beautiful Christmas story. I used to show it on VHS to my friends at my northern Wisconsin cabin at Christmas time. Very touching. Highly recommend.
4,Beautiful color - but no Closed Captioning/Subtitles.....,"I too saw this wonderful film long ago on PBS. I just bought this DVD because my VHS version finally wore out. The colors are beautiful in this DVD, but beware --it does NOT have closed captioning or subtitles - at least the DVD I received does not! It would be so nice to have - especially for the conversations between Old Geraint and his grandson, Thomas. The young boy is very hard to understand.Beautiful story, lovingly filmed - a classic to watch at Christmastime."
5,The Perfect Christmas Story,"This is a superlative telling of Dylan Thomas' classic Christmas story which I have watched several times every Christmas season for the past ten years. I never tire of its magical quality. Denholm Elliott is wonderful as the gentle grandfather telling his grandson the story of a long-ago childhood Christmas. Of course, Christmases are never so white as they are in one's own childhood. That is how the story begins. It continues with the events of a particular Christmas day...complete with visiting Aunts and Uncles, Christmas dinner and the shenanigans of ""naughty"" boys doing what boys did...and still do. Particularly poignant to me is the scene where the extended family is singing ""All Through the Night"" and the boy retires to his room where he looks out his window and reflects upon the day. The story comes to a close as the grandfather sees that snow is falling and that that yes, his now sleeping grandson will have the same magical memories."
1,NO NO NO! Why?,"I bought these for the same reason everyone else buys blank DVD's. No good. Had burn errors on 15 to 25 % of the disks. Every disk that did manage to survive the burning process skipped during playback. I decided to try these because the other brands I would like to use are too expensive for the ammount I consume. So save your money and keep away. Please don't leave a comment that says something like, ""does your DVD player blah blah blah"" or ""does your DVD burner yadda yadda yadda."" I know how to use a DVD burner and a DVD player I am a COMP TIA A+ certified Computer Technician."
3,Good but not its predesseser,"This show followed Amanda, you know the thief who was constantly getting Duncan Macloud (the Protaganist of this shows parent series, Highlander the series). It for the most part was good but as all spinoffs not quite as good as the original. The original though struggled in ratings, and was carried by Adrian Paul(the main star)was still a good show good stories and good acting. This show tryed but it to struggled in the ratings and it distibuter Ryhser Entertainment pulled the plug they also distributed the original."
2,Good screen,The screen itself works OK. But it looks like a cheap product. Everything is made of plastic. The rod on the bottom is wrapped with the bottom end of screen fabric and stapled together. And the plastic smell was very strong. It had a few dark scratchs on it and could not be easily removed. We returned it.
4,I Need help with this player,"I was looking to hack this player but i couldnt find any information about this model but i found a hack for the sd 4900.This hack is about to burn a cd with this structure:RMTM0000/Scarlet/kpjc19_1.dvdSo i did this, put the dvd in the player and nothing happened.So i forgot it but my surprise was when i wanted to watch a dvd.It doesnt work! and the message Wrong disc region apperead.Now i cant watch any of my dvd.Please somebody help me to fix thisadohnis@hotmail.cmThanks"
1,Bad DVD player!,"Got this to upgrade the Philips DVP642 for a new HDTV. I really want to stay with Philips. However, their DVP5960 doesn't have optical audio out (it has only coaxial out) - can't understand why would this option was removed. So I went to BestBuy and got the Toshiba. It got all I wanted, the HDMI and optical outs, Divx capability, DVD+/-R. The pictures were pretty good I think. Too bad it froze up so frequently, even when played with original DVD discs. It either skipped the track or often stayed in the freeze mode forever. The only way to get out of this was to turn it off and on again, which was a 2-3 annoying minute process. Luckily, I got it locally so I was able to returned it.I put in an order for an Oppo 981 through Projector People (Amazon takes 1 month to restock!). This little gadget got lots of star ratings from Amazon so hope it will be good as advertised!"
2,This player is junk!,"The Toshiba SD-4990 DVD player is junk! It constantly 'freezes' while playing back any type DVD. It randomly locks up for 3-12 seconds. I've tried resetting as described below, but that only worked for a few disks then unit started freezing again. Interestingly, there is little or no pause during layer changes. Toshiba tech support offered no help at all, telling me all my disks must be bad! Avoid this player!"
3,"Mark Rothko's Violet, Greena dn Red sold thru Amazon.","It's hard to reproduce a Rothko painting with all it's subtleties of color. The poster is a fair representation of the painting. It's nice to be able to share a larger version, than on a computer screen, to give a better sense of the actual size. I'm glad I got it to teach with."
2,Returned it,"I really wanted to keep this and use it, but it just didn't work properly. This cyclometer has amazing features, but whenever I would get over 20 mph, the speed readout would go nuts, flashing between 5, 8, 20, 30 mph before settling back down again. The altimeter also varied wildly from day to day ( I understand this is because of variations in barometric pressure), but even coming back from a 2-3 hour ride during a day with pretty stable weather, the base altitude would be several hundred feet different from when I left: not accurate."
4,The Old Disney Animation Prrocess,"A very nicely put together book. If you are into animation, this book is for you. Beautiful illustrations, there are some parts that drag a little bit. A good book for any person who wants to know how Disney put together their masterpeices."
3,"""ARE YOU HAVING A PARTY?""","Here it is, the ""karaoke"" version of ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show."" This is just the music tracks from the movie, with background vocals only. Now you too can sing the roles of Frank, Brad, Janet, Riff Raff, or any and all of your favorite characters from the movie. This CD is great for anyone wanting a fun party novelty, or die-hard fans who want to listen REALLY closely to those cool arrangements. And, as a bonus, the CD has 2 tracks not available on the Soundtrack (""Once in a While"" and ""Planet Schmanet"") plus extra verses in ""Frankenstein Place"" and ""Sword of Damocles"" that were cut from the movie."
5,"I love karaoke, and this is the best tape to karaoke to!!!","This is the coolest karaoke tape I have never listened to. I love the songs from the rocky horror picture show, and they are great!!!"
1,Mini is the key,"Mini Dictionary, so mini as to require a magnifying glass and not as good, in my opinion, as a travel phase book."
1,HORRENDOUS !!!!!!!!!,"Man what a racket ! I guess I sound like my parents saying this,but in fact I LOVE most UK82 hardcore punk bands,especially the harder ones,and have been listening to them since 1980,so I'm no newcomer to it and have an impressive collection.This made clear,let me tell you about this CD.Over an hour of exactly the same awful noise,none of these people can either play nor figure their way around pretending they can,let alone putting a song together ! 24 tracks of torturing soundalike rants.I would'nt keep this cr@p even if someone gave it to me as a present !!! It makes japanese crust bands sound melodic by comparison !"
1,Grommets misplaced.,"The grommets were off center and misplaced, half the grommets were not even fastened fully on the tarp. The paint comes off easily when scratched. Poor quality, I would not recommend this tarp to anyone. Walmart carries a superior ozark trail tarp for $7.99."
3,"Not bad, but.....","I won't argue all the pros and cons of this record, but one thing really galls me after listening to this repeatedly over the years. Now, I know Reiner is playing the straight man. However (Sir), the (Sir) constant (Sir) repeating (Sir) of (Sir) the word ""Sir"" everytime he speaks to Brooks' character gets really annoying. Now I know people were probably more courteous in the early 60's, but give me a friggin break. Also, I really doubt there is such a word in the English language as ""origination"". Some might see this as nitpicking, but it's what I've come to notice."
2,Awful!,"I must not fit the demographic profile for this book (40 year old female). Maybe this book is meant for the teenager to 20ish crowd. I am almost finshed thankfully. It's not that I like the book, but I have to finish what I start no matter how bad. The story line is really good but the writing seems almost elementary school level. I hope as ""Eric"" ages, the writing matures. I have to say that this is one of the worst books I have ever read! Whew!!!"
2,I agree with a few others.,"I agree with at least three others who reviewed the book, I thought the book would be better suited for the 16 to 22 year old crowd, but I don't think I would want my 16 or 19 year old sons to read it either. I find myself getting impatient with it, or maybe I've forgotten what it feels like to be seventeen. It pays to read the reviews.!!!!!!!!!"
2,"A bit flimsy, could work well","The item is a simple spring loaded mechanism which in theory should have worked. I did manage to pop a few flies off but the accuracy is not all there. You have to aim it a bit lower (right on the top of the circular projectile screen) because the projectile screen tends to travel upwards. It is difficult to get the flies, especially when they are on a corner or edge of something as the projectile can only hit a 2-3 inch radius when flat. This is not why I gave it 2 stars, because perhaps I needed some practice or just to get the hang of the right angles/distances, but because after the 2nd day of having this, it broke on me. The projectile is 2 pieces, the circular flat hitting surface and a plastic threaded tube which cracked in half. Says made in the USA, and for 7 dollars I'd rather get a few regular fly swatters. Not worth it, but can be a fun fly swatting game tool..."
4,Bug Gun,"Works good, but kinda nasty, be careful not to touch while reloading. Not easy to load without contaminating yourself with fly guts..."
1,Ridin' High (1968),"This was a very unusual period from Ferguson's career. This album is a neat novelty piece to have. I actually own the original LP of this recording. But it wasn't a very good album. It was probably recorded about the time Mr. Ferguson was having all of those dental problems, that he always spoke about. But the two highlights from the album are the cuts ""Satan Speaks"" and ""Alfie"". I'm really glad to see this album on CD though! I wish they would put all of Maynard's complete Mercury/EmArcy LP's on CD, like ""Boy With Lots of Brass"", or ""Dimensions"". That would be really cool!"
1,<<<<Don't buy the book the help files are all you need>>>>>,I recomend that you dont buy any book on flash 4 because it's not necesary all you have to know is in the interactive help files an examples provided with the software
5,Number 1 in my book,"After retiring our 12 cup Cuisinart (at least 2 pots a day for 5 years)we decided to try this one. We love the increased capacity and it is no problem measuring the water because we pour it from the pot. We do, however use a funnel when pouring it in the reservoir. No spilling. I am hoping we get as many or more excellent cups of coffee out of this coffeemaker as we did the old one."
3,Works great except for the fire thing,I've had this machine for a few years and it worked great until today. It caught fire and did not trip the circuit breaker. Thank goodness my wife was home at the time. I would buy the same one to replace it....OR NOT.
2,Poor design,"The water indicator is indeed difficult to read - but not as difficult to read as the lcd display, which is tiny and unlit - you need to get face to face with it.The water resevoir has a relatively small and awkwardly shaped opening - care is required when filling to avoid spillage.The control knob is impossible to turn if your hands are wet.The filter ripped soon after I purchased it.You have to take extra care to keep the internal plastic cone clean, or you will get grind overflow when you make the full 14 cups - this has happened to me twice - a mess.Brewing is relatively slow.The lid does not hinge, but can only be removed.The auto-off system turns off way too soon for me and is not adjustable.The unit is overpriced.The coffee it makes is fine - I'm no expert, and the unit is attractive."
1,Caution - Catches Fire after a few months,"It is really a shame that this machine is poorly designed to suddenly go up in flames after a few months use without any warning. I really liked the unit but cannot recommend it because of the extreme danger. Fortunately, I was home when it went up in flames and had to unplug it and throw it out into the yard (the smoke and fumes filled the kitchen). This machine cannot be left unattended and plugged in. Your house and family are too important to risk over a poorly designed fire trap."
2,No fire yet - just bad coffee,"I have had my Cuisinart 14-cup Brew Central Coffee Maker for about 6 months. It hasn't caught fire yet, but I just don't like the taste of the coffee. I had a Krups for about 10 years which made wonderful coffee. I have used HEB's Taste of San Antonio coffee in both coffee makers and you cannot taste the fine flavors of the coffee in the Cuisinart. I will replace it, especially now that I have read it might just spontaneously combust. I wanted to buy another Krups,but the lady at Macy's said Krups aren't good anymore. Will have to do more research on that."
3,Very good until breaks,"Lasted almost exactly a year (355 days to be precise). Then the front panel went dead, with nothing displayed. Would come back a few times after left unplugged for several hours, but eventually died for good. BB&B was gracious enough to exchange the item, but beware. Other than that, brews great coffee and convenient to use. One small quibble is that when you open the lead to remove the coffee container, it drips to the back of the coffee maker on the counter -- had to have a paper towel underneath at all times."
1,Great coffee with a hint of smokiness,"This coffee maker really makes great coffee. Unfortunately, as others have reported, IT CAUGHT FIRE!!! Do NOT use the Programmable feature on this coffee maker - it seems to catch fire when the coffeemaker is brewing and you want to be around to take it outside to finish smoking and burning. Cuisinart could care less - so I filed a report with saferproducts.gov"
4,Pretty darn good book!,I read this book for school. I am in 7th grade and this book is 250 pages. It is about a wizard who is looking to marry a witch. He is a black wizard who wants a black witch. He holds a contest for the witches to perform the blackest trick. Belladonna is beautiful and REALLY wants to marry him. The problem is she is white! What does she do? Read the book! I absolutly recommend it!
4,a great story with a great plot,"I read Which Witch a little while ago and I found it to be great. Arriman had a good personality, the common man with powers. In class, we had to write a book review, and I chose to do Which Witch. It was a great buy. The thing that was really fabulous inside this book was the epilogue, where Terence was more to him than expected. The reason I give this book a four is because I think it could use a little revising with the plot and everything, it've have to been a little bit of revising to make five stars. Otherwise than that, I loved Which Witch. This is the only Eva Ibbotson book I've read. I am looking forward to reading other books by her in the future, such as Dial-A-Ghost."
5,Which Witch?,"Although Eva Ibbotson's The Secret of Platform 13 is the more well-known novel, I've always felt it's completely overrated. This, in my opinion, is her real work of genius. I read it repeatedly as a child and loved it more each time, finding great new aspects I'd missed each time. Now, many years later, it's still as adorable and enjoyable, with a complex plot, highly unique characters that grow on you, and a mystical, fantastical tone that anyone will love. Ibbotson demonstrates her great talent at plot twists as well in this great book! My one minor complaint is that she does spend a little too much time directly describing each character (your typical paragraph blurb, giving a physical description), and that's something that always disturbs my reading and my imagination in general.Rating: 5/5"
5,Great Book to Read!,"I love this book. If you like books like Harry Potter and Searching For Dragons, then you will abosulely fall in love with this book. It is very funny and has a creative mysterious plot. I love books that have so many creative ideas. Please buy this book, Eva is a wonderful new author. A must read book!"
4,Which Witch,"Which Witch is related to Island of the Aunts and is written by Eva Ibbotson. This book is slow at the beggining but very detailed towards the end. Ibbotson makes the book realistic.Belladona is the only white witch, with hair golden, silky, shiney, and gracefully sways right to left. My favorite part in the story is when all the witches are being picked up by a mysterious bus. The witches sit in the bus and talk trash about each other while going to their gathering. If you like wizardry, why don't you check it out at your local library."
3,Predictablity ruined the story,"As soon as the main characters of this story were introduced, the whole book became very predictable, ruining the want of finishing the book. The characters, like classic Roald Dahl style, are mostly overly-exaggerated, very few characters had much depth. Though having a bit of dry humor, I found it not so enchancing or funny. A charm-less book to me."
4,Terribly Exciting!,"This is one of Eva Ibbotsons best books. It is so exciting and it was hard to put it down. If you stop...you won't find out what fun thing will happen next. This is one of the best books I have ever read. If you like the series of unfortunate events or harry potter, you will love this too!"
3,delivery service,"The shipping service that was used had a ridiculous amount of trouble finding our house! It took 3 attempts, over a weeks' time and numberous calls to find us. I would suggest that you find another delivery service!"
4,Pick & brush combo is good,So we already had a pick but it didn't have the brush which was kind of a pain. The combo of pick & brush is much more effective in cleaning out those hooves so you can see what's going on in there when you are cleaning. It would be nicer if it had a more substantial handle but for the price it does the trick. Glad they were in stock again!!!
5,"So Good, I Kept Checking It Out of the Library","I've probaby checked this out of the local public library at least eight times. When you do something like that, it's time to just buy the book. I like this book's straightforward, simple approach - and one that doesn't insult your intelligence or talk down to you. The chapters on jealousy and bipolar disorder are especially well-written. Get this if you need an all-purpose guide to mental illness."
5,A Substantial Time Piece for the Money!,"This watch met all my expectations for a Pulsar and more! I had been wearing my first Pulsar gold tone watch for close to 23 years when it finally went dead, so I knew the brand was a very good one. The price point on this was excellent and I'm so glad I made the purchase. It is excellently made and after having it sized down for my small wrist, wears perfectly. It has a substantial weight to it, but is not heavy like so many of todays watches. I am 5'3"" and didn't want a huge, honken wristband, but one that would not only look good on the job, but is as well suited for a night on the town. It has a great dressy feel to the bracelet, but is not overdone. The bracelet itself is beautiful and matches all my 14k gold perfectly. You won't go wrong with this time piece."
1,fast and fantastic!,Mash season 9 arrived much faster than expected and is in perfect condition. Extremely satisfied!!!!!!!
1,"No bounce, no fun","I bought this as a replacement for an indoor electronic Nerf Showtime Hoops basketball goal as Nerf no longer sells replacement balls. It was a huge disappointment, especially for the amount I paid. A ball from the dollar store would have been better. It did fit through the rim, but it has minimal bounce or spring and is heavier than it should be. I don't recommend it at all. I should have returned it! I can't think of any great use for this ball."
2,Didn't last as long as it supposed to...,"I bought that 10 inches clamp for the 250 watts infrared heat ceramic emitter (there were shown as matching). After a year and a half (almost constantly on for my two cats sleeping area) the wire that enters the ceramic head of the clamp lamp burned inside and melted the plastic a bit so there was a short. The lamp clamp stopped working since the wire inside were corroded with the screws and as a result,no longer connected."
3,Pretty Box,"After visiting my local craft stores, I discovered it is much cheaper to buy all the materials in this box individually than to buy this kit. The materials contained in the kit are also lower quality than you'd find in a craft store, or even in the craft section of Walmart. The box is nicer than anything in it. The bracelets, for example, are made of flimsy felt. The activities are very simple, I would not recommend for older children (9-12 years is probably too old!) unless you are fine with 5-10 minute crafts. While this sounds like a horrible review - it is - my 11 yr old was not entirely displeased. She gave the finished crafts to her younger siblings as gifts."
1,SuperHornet01,This book really doesn't tell you anything you can't find in the users manual. If this book had provided more indepth information on how to maximize my Visor (i.e. mobil use) then it would be much more useful. Some analysis on how Visor and some of the Springboards interact would be great!
1,Very disappointing.,"I've read every Rona Jaffe novel, and loved them all. I had great expectations for The Cousins. I'm sorry to say that not only was I terribly disappointed but I couldn't even finish the book. Definitely not one of Rona's best."
5,What A Beautiful Mind!,S.L. Cagnina is a much under-rated writer. The life-experience he displays in his writing is well beyond his years. He has a true gift. I do hope he will continue to share it with the world. Mr Cagnina: Please publish again soon!
2,I expected more,"Such a great voice, but the songs are disappointing. ""Hotel rooms have their share of ghosts/One just flew out from the mini bar"". What??? Boring lyrics, song structures are typical and pedestrian. Didn't move me at all."
1,A real disappointment,"I saw this book excerpted in the May issue of Oprah magazine and was delighted by the rich, colorful close-ups of flowers in full bloom. Right away, I ordered one book for myself and one for my mother-in-law (should have read the Amazon editorial review that notes the flowers are in the later stages of life). We were surprised and dismayed to find that every one of the photos is a dull brown flower on a black background--and nearly all of the flowers are dead or dying. We could still appreciate the beautiful photography and the theme of death & dying, but with the subtitle ""The Life Cycle of Beauty"" it would have been nice to see more of the full life cycle--as in colorful buds and full-blooms in rich hues. All of the bright, colorful photos that were in the magazine excerpt were instead rendered in dull browns. We're both sending our books back. Totally depressing."
4,Good stuff,"I bought this solely because I'm a fan of Dave Kellett, but I love hot sauces as well. This is sweeter than most hot sauces I buy, but it adds a great flavor to jambalaya, tacos, burritos and just about everything else I've tried it on. I would recommend this for any hot sauce lover who occasionally wants a good flavor without the burn."
2,Not worth the money,I was quite disappointed in this workout DVD. IT is very hard to follow the instructor because she is not following any type of music or count. You have to add your own music while you workout to this DVD. This makes it extremely hard to hear the instructions not to mention the wind which is a constant in the background. I have many many workout DVDs that I have bought for $10 or less which are a much better quality and workout. I would not recommend this.
1,Not Received,I have never received this product in which I ordered in July. The date is currently 8-31-2007
4,Big Help,I bought this book for my 98 year old mother who is desperately trying to learn to play Mah Jong so she can join in with her friends. It helped her a lot and now she's happily playing the game and referring to the book for help when necessary.
1,Error message C:31:22 on two units -- a piece of junk,"Number of yrs. ago, I purchased one with the error message C:31:22 about a yr. later, then purchased another one in Houston which was on-sale, same error message appeared again less than a yr. under seldom usage. The error message prohibited me to use both units for more than 2 yrs.Today, I found out that the error message was nothing to do with the real problem, it was a fault message that prohibit the use of both units, all I did just smashed the unit hard.Since such purchases with bogus message, I am totally away from any SONY products, paying too much for both piece of craps. The most important thing is --- I almost lost all the precious mem. of the family just because of purchasing the wrong brand product."
5,Well done practical high level book for primary care,"Well done for primary care. Book includes pathophysiology basis, diagnosis and treatments for many entities. The thought process for each diagnosis and chapter is very logical.This is a high level book.While the quality of the writing was well done. The paper and quality of the binding was a disappointment. The binding began to break the first week. The paper appears thinner and is not as substantive as many older books I own."
5,Grooves,Fatback Grooves so Hard here.Covering a Wide Range of Styles with Such ease.I Like Girls is a Classic Summer Time Jam.Backstrokin' Grooves Too hard.that was My Old roller Skating Jam.Gotta Get My Hands on Some Money is Bumping as well.Groups Like Fatback Use To Be The Norm.Real Instrumentation.this Group COmbined So Many Different Flavors.Very Essential.
4,Fatback Still Strong,"I was surprised how clean and crisp the band still sounds,my friends could not stop going oh no they didnt.When they heard I Like The Girls again every word was sung by everybody then i put on I Found Love and it was all over.They rocked the house.The music brought on discussions of the good old past.wine women songs. What a blessing."
4,"Good scholarship, poor book production","Minor distractions from the otherwise impressive scholarship in this book are the woefully inaccurate maps accompanying the text. In one wildly wrong map, the port city of Charleston is located not on the Atlantic but thirty or more miles inland on a river's bank. I realize such errors should not be chalked up against the author, but for such an expensively-priced volume, a reader should also receive accurate illustrations. A university press should have taken greater care in the production of this otherwise excellent book."
4,Costly but damn interesting!,"My opinion is this is def. not worth the money. It is a very interesting text, but not worth the amount the writers set out to get."
5,Robin of Sherwood Season 2,Our family loved this series on Showtime. We still quote from it! It is wonderful to have to watch again!
5,A great series,"I loved this series when it was on Showtime back in the 80s. Too bad it was taken off the air. If you like that renaissance type of stuff, this is a must see series. Each lasts 1 hr."
3,cello,not what i would think would be in a beginers book but they got what you need once you get the basic stuff down
3,"Salty, soggy and not too nice","It is good enough for a quick bite when you don't have a kitchen, but I'd rather avoid it if possible. The picture on the case is pretty misleading too. The beef is gray and the vegetables are pretty miserable. If nothing else is available then it can be choked down without too much objection, but one could get sick of these pretty fast."
3,A Good Read In Need Of a Sports-Wise Editor,"I found this ""fictional"" acount of an historical event quite interesting and informative until I read that Chaplain Goode enjoyed watching Orioles-Senators baseball games while attending school in pre-WWII Baltimore. How was this possible since the Orioles did not come into existence until moving from St.Louis to Baltimore following the war? The authors Wales and Poling slipped up here. Otherwise, the account of this fateful wartime voyage was very moving and inspiring. An enjoyable one-night read."
4,Beresford's Bride by Margaret Way,"Description from the book back cover:Wedding fever ... Nothing could keep Antoinette Streeton away from her brother's marriage into the influential Beresford family, not even knowing how shocked they all were at her current lifestyle. She presented a seductive temptation to Byrne Beresford, the head of his family's vast Australian cattle empire. Looking spectacular in her bridesmaid's dress, Toni had a radiance about her whichy Byrne found increasingly hard to resist. Surely one wedding couldn't lead to another? Toni was totally unsuited to become this Beresford's bride ...The Big Event! One Special Occasion - that changes your life, for ever!"
3,me,I suppose you get what you pay for but even then it seems a bit much for some cracked wood and Olympic wood. looks great against the corner thought and is unlike anything i could find so i would buy it again.
4,"Wrong parts, but fixed fast",When we were putting the changing table together we were given two part Cs instead of a part C and part D. Because of this one side of the changing table is missing for now. I went onto the Badger website. Not only are they sending me the part for free they're also giving me a 20% off my next order with them. I'm impressed that they handle their customer service so fast (within an hour of me sending in my complaint). I will continue to buy from them. They have my respect for fixing the problem right away and being very friendly as well.
3,"Good, but not great","In watching this DVD with my almost 3 grand daughter, yes, it was cute, it got both of us up dancing/exercising, but I was a ""bit Taken back"", with the ""belly dance"" sequence....Thought it a bit ""much"" for toddlers to 5 year old. Sorta sexual , the movements . They could have picked another dance, maybe ""disco or the Jive. "" Something more innocent for the youngsters...yet still fun and lots of movement."
5,Excellent and Affordable,"This is an excellent book and affordable. Some other reference books are very expensive and don't have the great photos and data presentations that this book has (I still highly recommend the others, but they are not cheap). This book saves a lot of time and makes it easy to show other people exactly what you are trying to say, and they will be impressed with the quality of this publication. Excellent book in its own right and can easily double as a ""coffee table book"" and a great conversation starter."
1,Disapointed,"Although the graphics were in detail, as an avid saltwater flyfisherman I was disapointed in the discriptions given for the species...When Mackrel was discribed there was no mentions of Tinker Mackrel a major food souce for Striped Bass who feed on this fish.( What I found interesting was the color plate for ""Alantic Mackrel"" looked a lot alike Tinker Mackrel.) When Weak fish were discribed a total length of 20 inch was given. I personally caught and released a Weak Fish well over 28 inches weighing in at 8 pounds.I did not bother to read the rest of the book. I was hoping I could learn something but, I have no idea what the total facts are in species I know not much about. I just don't think there was enough research given when putting this book togather."
1,King James Compact Large print bible,This was NOT LARGE PRINT. It was either a case of false advertising or they put the wrong book in the box. The size of print they showed outside was definitely NOT the size inside.
5,Great little level!,"Bought a few of these in the clearance isle at the local big box store for about $5 each. Great small levels for pictures, plumbing, just about anything. The magnet is handy, rarely do you use the 45deg but I have once or twice. If one of the levels (like the 45deg level) was adjustable to various angles this would be outstanding."
2,Black plastic peg makes level unusable,"The level arrived with one of the two holes plugged with a black plastic peg that affixed a cardboard product label. The cardboard label was easy to rip off, but removing the black plastic peg was extremely difficult. In fact, I am virtually certain that I damaged the level while removing this plug. Now, I am worried about using it. I am not sure if the twisting and bending actions required to remove the plug affected the level calibration. Consequentially, I do not want to risk using this level. In short, go for a different company's product."
4,"A nice, compact boom box","I was pleasantly surprised when this little boom box arrived for one of my mother's friends. There appears to not be much of a CD player market any more and most of the first tier vendors have gotten out of the business. But after wondering what a Coby product would be like I found it to be as nice as anything Aiwa or Sony would put out. It has a nice finish, good sound, and the controls are not the cheap pieces I thought they would be. I am happy with this purchase."
3,Good enough for a child's room,"I bought 2 of these for my boys 4 & 7 for Christmas. The 7yr old's worked great, but the 4yr old's did not. It's radio worked, but the CD player would not work properly at all!! I made contact with Amazon's customer service (which can be terribly hard to do so sometimes!) and they sent me a replacement right away! I got it literally a day later! But they sent me 2 instead of 1 because I ordered 2 the first time. Besides that confusion and frustration of the returns...I'm glad my sons enjoy their personal CD players!"
2,Broken and Disapointed,Length:: 4:15 MinsI thought a video is worth a thousand words so I gave a review of my product that was received yesterday. I have no anger as these things do happen sometimes. This is only my opinion on what happened to me. I still love Amazon and will continue to buy from them! Matter of fact as soon as I return this item I will be purchasing another mp3 player! I have purchased other items and never had a problem. One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch!
1,How do you mess up an ice cream scoop?,"Why haven't I used this ice cream scoop yet? The manufacturer didn't care about the fact that the no-dishwasher warning label they stuck to the scoop used (presumably toxic) industrial-strength glue. So far scrubbing hasn't removed the glue, and its been soaking in my sink for a week.Add that to the fact that the scoop I received looks nothing like the picture (very cheap silver coating, obvious seams on the handle) and I'm fed up.Awful product and I'll attempt to return it."
3,"Scoops well, Does not Pick-up Well","I've had it only for a few weeks, and have only used it a handful of times, but I can say that it scoops the ice cream well, just isn't very good at picking up what you've scooped, especially if you're scooping from a new container of ice cream. I hand wash it, and it seems durable so far."
1,Seemed great until the nonstick coating started coming off.,"People that reviewed this product right after buying it, reviewed it too soon. Over time the nonstick coating comes off. Since I like vanilla ice cream, I could tell after awhile because there were specks of what looked like pepper in the ice cream after scooping it. Not wanting to eat non-stick coating, I threw the spoon away."
2,"Ok, but paint starts chipping off","This scoop is heavy and easy to use, but after about 6 months of occasional use the scoop part became pitted and the black paint started chipping off. Not sure if it is a health hazard. The paint is almost all off the inside of the scoop now and the aluminum is pitted. Doesn't bother me unless it's some kind of health risk."
5,Does the job,"I had a pampered chef version of this, but it was silver looking. Eventually the silver color looked tarnished and nasty even though it got thoroughly washed. I got this one after the PC one got washed in the dishwasher (a no-no! this will ruin it). I love the looks of this one SO much better, and performance is as great or maybe better as the pampered chef one."
5,One of the best albums to start your Salsa collection,"This album has a great mix of salsa that you don't get tired of. If I only got to choose one for my collection, this would be it. It'll get you dancing..."
4,Great gift for somebody special,"I bought these earrings for my wife's birthday and she loves them. When the earrings arrived, I was surprised on how small they are. The diamond is 1/8"" x 1/8"" and free of any visible defects. The great thing about buying from Amazon is the high probability you are getting a good value for your money. The earrings come in dark blue formal paper box with the earrings in a fabric bag, just wrap the box and the gift is ready to go."
2,"Might work for you, might not.",I found this to be an easy read but the advice is better done in other earlier books by other authors. That said you might get a morsel out of it. To me the book had the feel of an informercial.
1,wish I could review,"I wish I could review this book however jerseyxray never sent me the book and will not return any of my e-mails. Beware of this guy, he is a crook."
5,The Perfect Trip Planner,"I had always dreamed of going to Africa, but my husband was terrified at the prospect. We bought this Kenya guide in hopes of getting some accurate information. We found it very organized and pleasant to read. Ms. Vachon's book relieved many of his fears and we used the book intensely in planing our trip. Every tip, review and suggestion she wrote turned out to be true. We really credit this book in helping us experience the trip of a lifetime."
4,Great Camera,"I love this camera, we have had it for years, replacing an older JVC model. It is very user friendly, other family members have it too. We have hours of video of our children. I was not able to transfer any video to my new computer with VISTA on it. We finally discovered that if you get a 4 pin/6 pin firewire it will work. I successfully downloaded 4 hrs last night. I was thrilled. We did get an adapter for my Express Card slot because I do not have a firewire port on my labtop."
2,Nice Camera but no better than a lower priced Sony,"I bought this camera instead of the DCTRV250 becasue is had memory stick options for stills and also MPG recording on memory stick and also the 700 zoom.All 3 options that I mentionabove I felt would be worth the extra $...but I was wrong. The still are poor quality, the MPG's have very poor resolution and when you use a zoom this strong, when you actually do zoom with any distance of over 100 to 200 feet, the picture loses more than 50% of its quality. Its too bad becasue I was very excited... but save your $$ until they can improve these 3 features."
1,loud horn but high failure rate,"This horn was awesome when I first bought it. It failed on me after about a year. the compressor still works but only 1 of the trumpets is working now and it's not very loud. Maybe there's dirt or a little moisture in it. This horn cannot be dissembled and cleaned though, at least not without breaking into it. Many other people have complained about the high failure rate of this product. even though it's the loudest compact air horn I have been able to find, I would not recommend buying it. To me a horn is incredibly important to be able to depend on. This is not a product that has inspired my confidence. Buyer beware."
4,Louder than stock horn on my bike.,"Installed this horn on my bike.I separated the pump and the horn so that I can install the pump in to the ""toolbox"" behind the left side cover to make a cleaner look(stock look is too bulky).Although it still is louder than stock, it don't sound as loud due to separation of the two components...I didn't take into account the 5' of 3/8"" tubing separating the two and subsequent loss of little air pressure(sounds little different tone wise compared to leaving it as one unit)and a split second delay for the horn to come on.Still, it's heck of a lot better than the ""beep,beep"" road runner noise of the OEM horn.I'm going to try smaller size tubing to see if it'll increase pressure and return the original sound and volume."
5,Stebel Horn Review,This is an amazingly loud horn. Much louder than twin Fiamms. Not the smallest horn in the world and it needs a strong mount.
1,Sounds like a sick cow,"I got the horn for my motorcycle for a louder sound and to let people know where I am on the road when i get cut off. I thought i was getting a Motorcycle Compact horn from Stebel and got a Compact horn for Cars. the instructions are easy to read but they are for a car not motorcycle. I assumed (i know what that means) I would have the motorcycle Horn (wrong) i will be returning and getting the correct horn. also i was going to keep the horn if sounded loud (WOW Sounded like a sick cow or moose) thier was more sound out of stock horn than this thing. Two thumbs down from me, sorry not impressed RideSafer Motorcycle Saftey Products."
3,Interesting but flawed character study,"This book would be much better if it had fewer clumsy, overwrought metaphors. Still, it tells an engaging story with realistic pauses and climaxes. Shriver has a good ear for dialogue; her characters are well-developed. I own this book and have reread it several times, skipping the extraneous parts that distract from the narrative. Strong novel all in all, definitely worth reading."
5,This truly is the score of scores!,"It took us many decades but finaly we can enjoy the full score for Ben Hur! Over two and a half hours of spectacular music representing romance, pain and suffering, faith, and the glory of Anchient Rome. The score lies spraid over two cd's and has been printed chronologicaly. In a word, Miklos Rozsa's musical empire hasn't yet fallen. Even today, with John Williams, John Barry, Jerry Goldsmith and all those other briliant composers, this score still sounds tremendously huge and all together better than anything you've ever heard. If you think you can enjoy music from the glorious days of Holleywood, then don't wait purchasing this score. It definitely IS worth the money!"
4,good luggage identifier,I use these mainly to make my luggage easier to spot in the airport pickup. It might also help to keep a bursting case together. Only disadvantage is that it can be fussy to get fastened securely.
1,duds,"although the package arrived quickly, the packaging does not match the picture exactly. Upon testing the product, 6 of the LED lights were duds and did not work. Returning."
3,OK,"I ordered these rope lights, and thought they are high quality, for some reason, small section of the lights go out when I'm trying to adjust them. This is very annoying, because I don't want to purchase a new set, because 80% of the lights still work. I'm not sure why this happens, but I won't purchase these again."
1,Some Defects,"I bought 6 white light sets & various color sets. No problems with the color sets. One white light set malfunctioned after only a few uses where about 12"" of light failed to illuminate. I was able to return that set without a problem. About 2 months later another white set malfunctioned in the same way. Due to Amazon's 30 day return policy I wasn't able to return that set & have to present a warranty claim to the manufacturer.Celebrations Indoor/Outdoor Rope Lights 18', Clear"
4,Rope Lights,"I purchased the rope lights while down range for the holidays to bring some cheer to a somewhat dreary season being spent in Afghanistan. Our building looked great and there were a lot of compliments on the lighting at night. I heard there were problems with the rope lights as far as the illumination -- however, we had no problems and I had many an inquiry as to where I purchased the lights, which I was more than willing to provide. Thanks for making our holiday season down range more bearable and illuminating!"
2,Not the comedy I have come to expect.,"The first episode on the tape is good, but the second one is the worst of the series. On top of that it was the LAST episode and did not give a proper goodbye. Its just another episode and you can't even tell its the last one. Its not funny, and leaves things in the air."
4,"Quick Shipping, Great Shape","This was a gift to someone else, so I do not know how well it works, but it looks like it is in top condition."
4,Fascinating,"An excellent compendium of the relationships and interactions between discordant stone age peoples and numerous technologically superior counterparts.This book is written primarily from a Unites States Vs Native American perspective. However, it acknowledges US, British, French, Spanish, and Mexican interactions, all of which treated the American Indian in much the same way: Make them dependent on foreign technology, guns, powder, fabric, iron, food, transportation, etc., and use that dependence against them.All European influences exploited inter tribal differences, hatreds and animosities, fighting the American theater of European wars with Indians against Indians. All introduced diseases and some utilized germ warfare in defeating their Native American enemies. From the outset in 1492 the result was a foregone conclusion: Native Americans would be annihilated.This is the story of how it happened."
3,Bloody Adventures in the Warhammer World,"The Zavant Konniger cases are more like fighting adventures than detective stories. The investigation of the sage-detective and his halfling sidekick often leads to fierce hand-to-hand combat rather than mystery-solving routines. Apparently, the tales are heavily influenced by popular cinema culture. There are 4 cases covered in the book. 1. Buried secrets (chasing after artefacts from mummy tomb). 2. Red Moon over Altdorf (solving murder mystery by visiting somebody in the asylum). 3. Politics of Shadow (hunting vampire). 4. Horror at Alt Krantzstein (poisoning in corrupt monastery). All are well-known themes in the movie industry. Notwithstanding the problem of originality, the last tale offers an interesting mix of Warhammer battle, siege, and an explanation of the spread of Chaos (fans of the Mordheim game will find some familiar ideas here). On the whole, I think Execution Hour by the same author is a better treat."
3,A Downer,"This was such a promising book, and Cody's prose is often beautiful and poetic. But he's mostly interested in aspects of the Columbia that don't interest me: the human geography, the industry, dams, fishing, and the technical side of canoeing. As a result, he inevitably gets more and more disillusioned by all the development and decimated salmon runs, and while these things are true, I just got too bummed out (and kind of bored) reading page after page of it. His focus on this gives the false impression that the majority of the Columbia is dams and development -- but in fact I am sure the opposite is true, that most of the miles he canoed were through wild and unpopulated country (even if that landscape was shaped by dams upstream or downstream). I also got a little weary of reading about how his mad canoeing skills got him through all the treacherous water. I'd have enjoyed the book far more if he had been more attentive to and descriptive of the natural history and natural scenery."
2,I'm disappointed,"Having purchased a number of ""... The Complete Reference"" books in the past, I must say that I am disappointed with this one. For all of the pages in this book, there really isn't much substance. There are too many illustrations with little text to back them up. I definitely would not recommend this book to a beginner. An experienced Exchange admin might value it as a reference but I believe that the Microsoft books are more useful in that capacity."
4,Overall it is a good book that holds your attention.,"Bruises by Anke de Vries presents a disturbing story that supports sympathy for it's charaters.When Judith's mother is not pleased,she takes her aggression out on Judith by beating her to a pulp.Judith learns to expect the beatings by thinking that they are normal.She begins to blame herself for them,until Michael tells her that it is not her fault and together they can over come this situation.The book's emotions are completely overwhelming.It it heartbreaking to see all the pain and suffering these two endure.Overall it is a good book that holds your attention."
4,Good book,"This book really gives you insight into this area - what it was like living here when it was at it's ""peak"". And then what caused the death of it and what it was like for the people and how it changed their lives. We gained a beautiful part of the country as a National Park, but these people lost their way of life. An interesting, informative read."
3,Informative But Not Engaging,"As an academic review of the life, sociology, and culture of the people who lived in Cades Cove from 1812 - 1937, Mr. Dunn did a good job. But the book lacks a strong narrative that carries the reader away into the ""life"" of the Cove. That is not surprising for an academic review such as this book is. There are scattered throughout the book wonderful little glimpses of life in the Cove, but I was hoping to get more of a feeling of the individuals who lived there. The last two chapters came closest to that by covering much of the life of the last John Oliver to live in the Cove. I visited the Cove in the Summer of 2009 and as I visited the historic exhibits I wondered what it must have been like to live in a community like this. Dunn's last chapter of the book describing the ""Death by Eminent Domain"" made my heart ache for those people who lost so much when the state of Tennessee took their community away from them to give the land to the National Park Service."
2,When will it end?,"I scanned the reviews for this book and was shocked to find out the story takes place over 3 days. I've been reading it for weeks and it seems to go on forever. A day for Frank Bascombe must last 72 hours, because he sure does a lot in a short time.If you hate Republicans, you'll love the author's gratuitous, ad hominem character's opinions regarding President Bush, and the GOP. It is plainly evident Mr. Ford is a liberal, as Frank, his main character-the person Mr. Ford speaks through.I tolerated as I plowed through this book, but it really is tiresome. It serves no purpose. I am glad I paid 25 cents for the book at a library book sale.The author provides excruciating detail about Frank Bascombe, and his Asian partner ""Mike"". We know everything Frank thinks and feels. And at a point, you don't care.It is a writing style that could be interesting with the right characters, but it does not work here."
5,Literature of great depth and intensity,"Ford's previous novel, ""Independence Day"" is one of my favorite books. I was very much looking forward to ""The Lay of the Land"" and, if anything, my expectations were exceeded. As usual with Ford's books, the writing is superb - the sentences carefully crafted, the plot densely layered, with Ford's subtle wit evident throughout. But the issues that Ford's protagonist, Frank Bascombe, tries to come to terms with in this book - loss, illness, mortality - take him even deeper into his essential humanity. Readers who want to get the most out of what will be an intense and powerful reading experience in any case, will want to read the two previous novels about Bascombe, ""The Sportswriter"" and ""Independence Day"" if they have not already done so."
1,didn't receive the book,"dUE TO ERRORS IN SHIPPING, i NEVER RECEIVED THE BOOK!!! You sent it to La Quinta instead of Walnut Creek"
2,needs editing,"To me it is obvious what it right and what is wrong with this novel. A good editor would have simply cut 150 or so pages from this 497 page, inflated novel, removed much of the repetitive and boring descriptions of the land, lay bare the plot, challenge the writer to improve the plot and add more characterization. What is good is very good indeed. The writing itself is golden with lots of humor. Wading through the morass of description was not a pleasure and not necessary for a book that could have been much better."
5,Coolest stand ever,"I've had many stands over the years. Some don't fold real well, some had little parts that could fall off and get lost and some were just big. This baby folds like a champ, small and compact yet sturdy when set up. I would not waste my time trying to find something that's a couple bucks cheaper, this is the stand you want."
4,Well presented...,There were a lot of specific suggestions for accomplishing the goal. I look for that in a book.
3,Very Sorrowful,"Peter Handke's slim memoir is necessarily sorrowful; it is about his mother's suicide. She was a survivor of the holocaust, and like many survivors, suffered from severe depression in the subsequent years. Handke's tone is cold, removed, and sepulchral. This is a vivid and moving text; it can not be easily categorized. It is non-fiction, but it is composed with the eye of a true artist.Not a read for everyone, but definitely an impressive effort. It is a testament to the ultimate destruction of Europe during WWII, glimpsed through the microcosm of a single individual."
2,Fuzzy sound poor quality,"When speaking or listening, sound becomes distorted and fuzzy. It is annoying to try to converse."
2,At&t phone,"I owned this phone barely over a year and the problems started. The batteries are shot. They can't hold a charge, my previous phone was a vtech and the batteries lasted over 3 years before I noticed diminished use. The speaker button no longer works on one handset (the call is disconnected when the button is utilized.) One handset won't work at all. So I have $260 investment that is practically useless. Very dissappointed, I should have bought a cheaper brand. The intercom functionality is horrible, you have to scroll through the menu to access it. Each handset has it's own address book (my old vtech had a central address book.) Think twice before buying this expensive unit."
2,So dull,"I love readinf about Japan, but this book was so bland, so unengrosing, that I put it down. Twice, I tried to go back to read it, but to no avail. If you like Japan, and everything it has to offer7 you'll want to avoid this book at all costs."
4,Flowered walking cane,"If you have to use a cane, this one takes a little bit of the sting out of it. It's sturdy, has a cushy handle, it's pretty (for a cane) and the price is very reasonable compared to others on the market."
3,"Good stand, poor customer surpport","I ordered the Hercules Sax stand, it is strong and it does what it is suppose to do and that is hold your horn and Clarinet/Flute. My reason for the 3 star rating is simple, when my stand came, it did not have the Clarinet/Flute peg. I sent an e-mail to the company letting them know that I was missing the peg. A person named David that works for the company e-mailed me back telling me that I could send the stand back for a refund. I did not want a refund, I wanted the missing peg. David informed me that they did not have any more pegs in stock. I went back on Amazon and seen that the company had 10 pegs in stock. I ordered the missing peg and was very displeased with the fact that David lied to me. I got the peg that I had to pay for in a very quick time. As I stated, good stand, but very poor customer support. I would have returned the stand, but I needed to do a very important gig. I feel that the company owes me a Clarinet/Flute peg."
2,A trilogy that ran out of gas,"I was really looking forward to the final book of the series, in both Red Mars and Green Mars, Kim Stanley Robinson was masterfully weaving a story using all aspects of drama. In the first two books he built real characters and included real human emotions and reactions like sex, greed, manipulation, murder. But I think he lost his edge in Blue Mars, it never had the drama of the other two books, the characters never came alive. His dialogue of the politics of Martian government was like watching C-Span for 24 hours, it just droned on far too long. Like some of the other reviewers, I found myself skipping ahead expecting something to get the story moving, but sadly it never did."
2,DULL,"""Red Mars"" was very well done, and all three books in this series are praiseworthy examples of technological research and terraforming projections, but none of that matters very much to most readers if the plot is a sieve, the characters wooden, and the action contrived. ""Blue Mars"" is a failure I'm afraid. I usually avoid SF, preferring historical fiction like the O'Brian naval adventure books, or WWII novels like ""The Thin Red Line"" or ""The Triumph and the Glory"" It is only because I'd heard so much about ""Red Mars"" that I tried Kim Stanley Robinson's trilogy, and the all three books were good in spots, overall I found them pretty tedious."
1,Forget it,"I struggled through out of principle, I wanted to say I at least finished it. Midway through the second book I had stopped caring about the characters. It is hard to wade through 600 pages if you don't care. Again technically good, but if you want to read about technical stuff get Mars Direct. Don't waste your time unless you really care."
2,It was tedious and technical rather than entertaining.,"The first two were riveting, but this final one was more tedious and it took a real effort to finish it. It reminded me of a writer who had written on one topic too long and was lost in detail that was probably interesting to him, but he had forgotten that most of us read to be entertained AND informed. In fact, for me, the story became more and more difficult to stay focused on the closer I got to the end, almost in the tradition of Murphy's Law that the work will slow down as it nears completion. Too bad."
4,interesting stuff,the star of this movie is nutty. he goes a little overboard to prove a point. so some of his gags are not that great.
5,More info,"This CD features Rossini's overtures performed by the Philharmonia Orchestra under Herbert von Karajan. (p)1961 and 1959 EMI Records Ltd., catalog# 763113-2 - my copy was made in W. Germany."
3,Eu no desfrutei este.,"This DVD doesn't satisfy you if you once have visited to Lisbon.Although its title is Lisbon, it has few places to visit and I can't get interesting enough information for traveling there again.Maybe you can choose another one which will let you smile.Try to search it!Boa noite!"
1,Shame on Avon and Amazon.com,"Do not buy the mass market edition. Shame on Avon Publishing!!! The type is so small that it is virtually unreadable, and any graphics, maps or diagrams cannot be distinguished. Pay the extra money to buy the edition published for Earthlings, not for Lilliputians.Most people will be drawn to the cheaper version offered by this on-line retailer, so shame on the on-line retailer for even carrying this edition. I am not exaggerating. The book is UNREADABLE."
4,Stairway To Heaven - thought provoking,thought provoking.Sitchin seems to do amazing research in multiple languages and diverse disciplines. Really liked this book and am reading the entire series.
5,An Intimate View of Sylvia Plath,"Sylvia Plath manages to shed a brilliant light on her life and experience through this diary that is sometimes painful and that often paints her experience with a beautiful and poetic richness, color and brilliance. Daily events come alive with unexpected meanings and shades of feelings through her carefully constructed prose. In one instance she describes her experience, waiting in a car, with the rain drumming on the roof, near the ocean with such amazing clarity and such a striking portrayal of her sense impressions that the passage leaves one breathless. I don't think I have ever read anything quite like that."
5,the future of live music,"Imagine being in a club, and hearing a great dj... then a live band leaps right of the vinyl. That's kind of what ""random escape plan"" by Second Sky sounds like. Bits of Drum N' Bass, House, and Dancehall, are all here. But the live instrumentation gives it a sort of ""live"" or ""organic"" feel. Songs like ""signs,"" with its bossa groove, string bass, and twinkling electric piano bring a loungy, acid-jazz vibe, in the vein of Theivery Corporation or Air. While the swirling techno of ""who am I"" reaches more toward Bjork or the Chemical Brothers. But there is no feeling of Identity crisis! Billy Medina's vocals offer continuity throughout the disk. Especialy on the opening track ""Picture This"": A cut-and-paste romp through very BECK-esque territory.Second Sky is a Band. A Band with songs... and an original take on electronic music. While often justly compared to bands like The New Deal... Medina's songs offer a personal touch that really hits home. Get this one!"
5,Helpful instruction,I've had issues with my stomach off and on since I was young. I just randomly searched to see if there was a yoga dvd that addressed digestion and stomach issues. I found this and thought I would give it a try. I've been so happy and have found this dvd to be so helpful. I try to do at least some or all of the dvd every night and have felt a lot of relief from practicing these yoga moves.
2,Talk About Subplots!,"I thought I would love this movie- it has Aishwarya Rai in it and the description said it was about a girl falling in love with a twin, who wasn't allowed to marry her because his father wanted to have both sons married to twins. I though it sounded funny, and the basic line of the plot turned out to be slightly humorous, but completely ridiculous. Aishwarya Rai was fabulous- as the person she was playing, but when she was trying to play her twin in the movie, I cringed at the bad acting. Her male costar wasn't that much better. Also, the movie was three hours long- because it devoted the first half hour to this subplot about the grandmother's brain surgery, which the doctors bungled and the twin she fell in love with helped her win this law suit, and then what felt like a few more hours was devoted to the father, who, as it turns out, was a Siamese twin whose wife was intentionally neglected by the other twin's wife . . . it was crazy and no fun to watch."
3,"Not 100% HD, but I am still happy","25% of the show is not in HD. Mostly the scenes from Hawaii and the Southwest. New York, DC, Chicago, Alaska and Philadelphia scenes are mostly in HD. There are some great footage in this Blu-ray, but they totally skip the Southeast and Pacific Northwest.The main locations in the disc are: NYC, Philly, DC, St. Louis, Chicago, Southwest (Utah and Grand Canyon), California, Texas, Alaska, and Hawaii.The shots of NYC and the glaciers in Alaska makes it worth the buy. I wish the show was longer then 60 minutes though.It really make me madwhen I spend my hard earned money on something that is suppose to in HD and then I found out that they basically lied to me. As consumers we need to stand up and demand better instead of rolling over and going oh well some of its in HD and least we didn't pay $30."
1,Blue ray POS,"I got this in a set of videos, (the 'Over' series) and this is one of the worst pieces of junk I have ever seen. Let me explain. I was expecting, not necesarily a wildlife video, but at least some beautiful shots of natural wonders of which this country has many (some may be surprised to know that, especially after seeing this video). The first 30 to 40 minutes is nothing but city shots, New York, Chicago, etc. Why anyone would want to see this is beyond me. America has some of the ugliest cities in the world. Taken into acount all the beautiful natural wonders they have forgone in order to show us this crap, it is beyond comprehension. Yes toward the end they show some shots of the Grand Canyon (over done!), but over all it was crap. I threw it in the trash where it belongs."
1,Lacks focus. Poorly written,"The experiences, which served as the foundation of this book, are quite real and valid - judging based on my 14 years experience in trading. Equally valid is the author's LACK of ability to focus on, and deliver, his message. Mr. Kiev may be trained in psychology, but for certain not in trading the financial markets, nor in writing. The only useful reading appears to have been arrived at from his notes and quotes of his clients, otherwise this book is mumbo jumbo. You will have a hard time following the author's cluttered thought process and message. Some passages in this book lead me to visualize traders, seated in a circle, holding hands and chanting, while ""clearing their minds"" in a markets pre-opening ritual. I would pass on this book."
3,Ok. Kinda Boring... Starts Good..Lags....Then gets BORING!,"This is the first Young Indiana Jones Movie I have seen, and it may or may not be my last. It was OK! Here are some problems 1) I do not think Sean Patrick Flannery can live up to be Harrison Ford, Harrison Ford portrays Indiana Jones as a rough action hero, who loves adventure. Flannery is...Uh...NOT THAT! 2) The Music in the movie, is quite bad. Not as good, as the regular Indiana Jones Theme Music. 3) The Movie is boring, the screen play is boring.. Not Lucas Type Material. I hope the other Young Jones Movies will be better.I only give it 3 stars because it INDIANA JONES the greatest adventure hero of all time! and because is was OK! If it is possible to rent this movie, then do it. If not then borrow it!"
4,A good beginning,"This is the first Young Indy movie that I have seen. A thoughtful adventure, it is more than just an action shot-em-up which so many modern films have degraded to. While I personally have a hard time seeing this younger Indy as being the same person as in the Harrison Ford films, I found it most enjoyable and plan to purchase other Young Indy movies based on this one."
4,This is pretty much all the ELP you need to own...,"With the exception of Nutrocker, this extensive box set is pretty much all the ELP you will ever need to own. The recording quality is excellent. I forgot how great these guys sounded during their innovative period between 1970-1974. Also contains the better stuff that came out after that period. My only quibbles are the liner notes are pretty lightweight and it's not in chronological order, meaning you're going to have to listen to something crappy from Love Beach before hearing some brilliance from Brain Salad Surgery. Lastly, this needs to be played loud to fully appreciate how dynamic ELP could be!"
4,"Works wells, but doesn't last long","You'll probably have to apply several times a day, as the liquid bandage starts to peel away, especially if you wash your hands a lot like I do. But it's easy to apply it and it dries pretty fast. Only other complaint is the smell, which is very strong. I recommend applying it in an area with an open window."
4,Cross Culture folktales,This was a fun book to read. I loved that the author chose to write it in both languages. I teach at a school that has had a few Ethiopian children. We are expecting an influx of more this school year. This book makes me excited that I have something to share of their culture and compare to the American culture as well. It was difficult to choose between four and five stars because this is the first children's book I've seen about/from Ethiopia. I reserve the fifth star for simply superb books. Silly Mammo didn't quite get there for me.
5,Great knife!,"Really exceeds expectations. Well made but very light and beautifully balanced. Great clip, good one handed opening, etc. Very happy with this in all aspects."
5,Dance Music at it's Best,"This is a fine cd of her singles from her various hard to find albums recorded between 1978-1985. I love all the songs especially ""Rough Diamond"", ""You Can"", ""On Fire"" and ""I'm No Angel"". Once you start playing this CD, you will exprience dancing bliss! Here are the tracklistings:1. Rough Diamond 6:152. Cherchez Pas 5:493. On Fire 5:434. Ecstasy 5:585. I'm No Angel 6:396. Cheri 4:487. Playing for Time 7:208. You Can 6:569. Forbidden Love 5:0210. You and I 4:1211. Fire in My Heart 4:1112. Megamix 7:04"
3,A decent compilation of Madleen Kane's songs,"I bought this one because I could not find the original Forbidden Love CD. The compilation is OK but lacking some real good songs. The sound quality is also OK but no more. I find it a bit ""bright"" sounding (shrill and a bit disturbing in the highs, with weak bass) but overall OK. For lack of other alternatives a good deal..."
2,Transparent case for BB Pearl,"The product arrived and was as stated. It is a solid and dependable case. Only problem I have run into, is that dust and other things get under the case alot. This means that I have to take it aloose and clean the phone at least once a day. Other than that, it is a great product."
4,A new Radiohead fan,"No before you jump on my back about only getting 4 when it deserves 5, please allow me to explain. Now this is my first radiohead album I have either listened or owned. I would have to agree with everyone else that it takes a lot of time to listen to, and I have been trying that. Some of the tracks, are simply crazy; the sounds in the background, the lyrics, they all come together at parts. But I think a 5 translates to perfection, and I don't think its a perfect. For one thing, I simply don't understand we suck Young Blood. Another problem is I don't get the metaphors. Maybe its my age and being only 17, but I'm pretty smart and I just don't grasp some of the things being thrown at me. Could it simply be my musical ""maturity""? Perhaps. But in any case, its a very unique CD and its worth listening to."
4,What's the difference?,"I know a lot of you out there are probably deciding whether to get the regular version of Hail to the Thief, the special edition, or if you're a big enough fan to get both. Well, I got both, and so I've taken the liberty to list what's different about the two editions.Things they have in common:- Same tracks- Lyric bookletThings the regular edition has exclusively:- An extended roadmap continuing off the cover- A black cd- A regular shaped, plastic cd case- CheaperThings the special edition has exclusively:- A large poster that looks like one of the pages inside the regular edition's booklet, only enlarged, with a color key, and some notes at the bottom.- A white cd- A larger, paper cd case- More expensiveSo, which cd is a better buy? Well, I liked them both. I found it odd that the special edition didn't have the extended roadmap that the regular edition has. Either way, the cd is still an awesome one."
5,Absolute Brilliance,"This is an album that will take a while to get into. Try a long car ride, listen to every song. Take it slowly, you'll be rewarded in the end.Hail To The Thief starts off with 2+2=5, and is Radiohead ""rocking out"" to an extent. Followed by Sit Down Stand Up, which builds into a brilliant chaotic climax ""of raindrops."" Sail to the Moon, is a very beautiful dreamy song, which satisfies greatly. Eventually you'll hit Go To Sleep which seems a bit out of place, and kind of jumps out at you with the fast guitar pace.I could go through and detail every song, but I'll just recommend a few for your first listens: 2+2=5, Sail To The Moon, Where I End And You Begin, There There Scatterbrain, A Wolf At The Door, and Myxomatosis. After these, take on everything else; you'll be rewarded with a life-changing album from your new favourite band."
2,Not that good,"Maybe I didn't like this cd because I am not a big fan of radiohead. track 1,2 and there there are the best songs on the cd."
4,OK Album,"If you like Radiohead and its electronic+guitar offbeat sound, I would like to make a few suggestions of similar genre:Gorillaz self titled albumOlive - Extra VirginU2 - ZooropaSkinny Puppy - Cleanse Fold and ManipulateThe Police - Ghost in the MachineKing Crimson - DisciplineKraftwerk - Computer WorldPink Floyd - Dark Side of the MoonThe Beatles - Sgt. Pepper'sandRadiohead Airbag/How Am I Driving? CD single/mini album. It is out of print but the 6 non-album tracks will make the search worthwhile."
5,The Greatest Album Ever Made,"You want to know how good it is?Mix OK Computer, Kid A, and Amnesiac.This is what you would get.The album is beautiful, melodic, depressing, angstful, fun, diverse, expirimental, gut-wrenchingly intense, captivating, and absolutely brilliant.It opens up with a sudden guitar amp plug-in and then Thom's perfectly toned moaning in '2+2=5' which goes from a quiet fog of a song to a romping roller coaster of guitar, drums, and fun vocals.The album only picks up from there.It goes into the depressing, intense, and captivating sounds of 'Sit Down Stand Up', 'Sail To The Moon', 'Where I End and You Begin', 'The Gloaming', and 'I Will'.It also carries the catchy, guitar-ish sounds of 'Go To Sleep', 'There There' and 'Myxomatosis', and the dark techno beat of 'Backdrifts'.Grade: A+"
1,R.I.P. Radiohead,Former Radiohead fan here. Each of their last three albums have grown progressively worse. This is the biggest clunker of all. They are a mere shadow of the great band they once were. In trying to break new ground they have completely alienated their fan base. Its really too bad...their early work is the stuff of rock legend. They were on the path to be one of the greatest rock acts in history. Now they will be footnoted as an imploded band that could have been.Here lies Radiohead. R.I.P.
2,2 and a half stars,"Insipid.There There is excellent, and Sit Down Stand Up is pretty good, but the rest of the album is slow, boring, pretentious treacle. I don't know why I wasted my money on it...maybe because I liked the video for There There. But honestly, this stuff just doesn't do anything for me. It isn't remarkable in the slighest. The point of music is to affect the listener emotionally; Hail to the Thief just doesn't do it. Music is supposed to be interesting! *Sigh* Need I go on?I much preferred Kid A...at least the melodies could really strike a nerveAnd by the way, I'm quite positive that most of the people who respond negatively to this review are avid Radiohead fans who have listened to Hail to the Thief a thousand times and already love it to death. Don't be bitter.Face it: the album is bland."
2,NOWHERE,"This is such a letdown!! Radiohead tries to hit a fine-line somewhere between OK Computer and Kid A - and the result leaves their sound NOWHERE. A half-hearted, half-a**ed, middle-of-nowhere mess that does not excite in the least. Coldplay are apparently the new Radiohead...let's hope they can stay the course. Radiohead are so over."
1,Buyer Beware....,"Radiohead used to be one of my favorite bands. Pablo Honey is my absolute favorite release of theirs. The last few releases, however, have been poor showcases of their vocal and musical talents. They have really gone downhill. It's too bad because they are capable of such great stuff. I hated the last few releases and I'm not liking this latest one any better. I wish I had borrowed it from a friend and burned it, or downloaded the MP3 instead of wasting my money on a CD that is going in the trash can."
4,Better than Kid A and Amnesiac,"Hail to the Thief captures the intensity of the band that seemed to me to have been put on hold while they experimented with Kid A and Amnesiac. I loved both albums, but they lacked the consistency of previous and subsequent efforts. Song highlights for me are 2+2=5, Sit Down Stand Up, I Will."
1,HORRIBLE,"Just like every other group out there trying to make money off of the heated political issues of today, Radiohead attempts to capitalize off an evergrowing trend. Radiohead needs to find a new niche because this one has been taken by groups that can do it way better like NOFX"
4,Radiohead bangs out another hit,"Hail to Thief is an awesome album. All the songs are a beautiful mix of guitar and electronic beats and noises. Think ""Kid A"" meets ""The Bends"". Don't expect every song sounding like their single 'there there' though. Most of the songs on Hail to the Thief are still pretty electronic. And just like most of their albums it takes a couple listens through to fully appreaciate it. Its not breakthrough, but its still damn good."
2,Fatigue-Inducing,"I love Radiohead and have enjoyed all their other releases since the Bends. Unfortunately tough, I have to admit that ""Hail to the Thief"" does nothing for me. While the band appears to be continuing to try to expand itself artistically and conquer new ground, it forgot to bring something essential with it -- good songs.I respect the band for pushing the envelope on each new recording, but I think they've gotten too caught up trying to be avant garde and have lost what made them great -- brilliant songs with thought-provoking lyrics that grow on you with each listen.Hail doesn't grow on you at all. In fact, it gets worse with each listen. In fact, after listening to it now about 7 or 8 times now, I find the process to be tiring. And fatigue is not what I'm looking for in a Radiohead release -- sorry guys!"
5,Radiohead's best album yet,"I've been a Radiohead fan since Pablo Honey. I absolutely loved The Bends and OK Computer. Kid A was okay, but very different (obviously), and I never got into Amnesiac. When I heard that the new album would be a bit more like their older stuff, I was excited. Sometime in March my friend sent me Hail To The Thief, letting me know that it was a leaked, unmastered version. Just listening to 2+2=5 I knew that this CD would be great.After months of listening to the unmastered album, the CD was released. I noticed the slight difference in some songs right away, and it just sounds alot better than the leaked version. Radiohead has truly perfected their own style of music. It takes the best parts from all their albums and is put together to form one incredible album. I'm not going to rate every song on the album, because that is for you to decide. This CD is perfect for any Radiohead fan, no matter which CD they prefer. From start to finish, this is one beautiful album."
1,I guess I'm missing something...,"After hearing ""There There"" a few times I gained a liking for it, and decided to give this album a shot. I've never really listened to Radiohead before, so this probably attributed to my dislike of their style. I'm not saying this album [is horrible]; I'm just saying it doesn't appeal to what I look for in music. I personally look for more energetic, loud, dynamic music with the guitars and drums being the driving factors, as well as a vocalist with a powerful voice. That's just not how Radiohead approaches making music, and no matter how hard I try to enjoy this album I simply can't. I find this album boring and monotonous. I guess I'm just not [into it]."
2,THOM WILL BOW TO HASSELHOFF,"Hail to the Theif = good758 chodes thinking that THEIR review will be special = badDAVID HASSELHOFF IS THE GREATEST SINGER EVER!!!the song ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good."
2,No Go,"Somewhere in the half-way wasteland between the great OK Comp and the somewhat interesting Kid A, this album is NOWHERE. It really, really is limp-wristed, half-arsed junk. The critics, of course, love it. Believe me - don't waste your time or money. Pass on this."
1,Anyone else's ears bleeding after a listen???,"Well....I should probably start this off by saying I really, really love ""The Bends"". It's in the top5 of my collection, and gets played regularly. I picked up some of Radiohead's other offerings with the hope I'd find another ""Bends"" to add to my collection....I could not have been more disappointed. I don't care for the ""electronic-techno"" sound they employ so often...and this album just continues that course. Initially I was sort of hopeful, as 2+2=5 sounds as though it could grow on you....but it didn't. Weird pinging sounds with ""fax machine screeches"" interrupted occasionally by a Thom Yorke wail do not equal good music for me. To be quite honest I'm left wondering if the rest of the reviewers here have lost their minds? (or, more likely, their hearing?) This is awful and left me wondering how I could love EVERY track from ""The Bends"" and yet not find one other Radiohead offering worth listening to..."
4,An Artistic Oddity,"I find this to be an interesting album. It is like Thom Yorke took 'Ok Computer', 'Kid A' and 'Amnesiac' and blended them together to form 'Hail To The Thief'. I can agree with the other reviewers that this album does lack some flow. But, Radiohead has never been able to fit into some sort of formula.This album takes longer to ""get into"", so to speak. I had to listen to it a few times to truly appreciate it. I remember feeling the same way with 'Kid A', and I like that album a lot now. I really like the title of this album and how it corelates with the 2000 election. I find Radiohead's tongue and cheek response funny.I think this album does fit into any Radiohead fan's collection. Its a good album, but maybe not as brilliant as Kid A, The Bends, or Ok Computer. It is still good stuff. If you are new to Radiohead, this may not be the best album to start off with. Try 'The Bends' or 'Ok Computer.'"
4,Let's Not Get Carried Away,I see a lot of 5 stars for this album. Everyone is entitled to an opinion but if Hail is 5 stars The Bends must be 7 stars.Hail To The Thief is better than both Kid A and Amnesiac but can't touch OK Computer or The Bends. It is true that it combines elements of both the older and newer style albums.I submit this however:If you combined the best tracks of Kid A and Amnesiac and compared it to this release the combined record would blow away Hail To The Thief.I give it 4 stars because 3 1/2 is not an option. It's good but hardly mind blowing like some past material.
3,Maybe I'm Missing Something,"Overall, not that great and kind of hard to listen to in spots. However, There There (Track 9) is one of the best things they've ever recorded and the best song on this disc by miles."
4,best of 2003,"2003 will go down as a fascinating year in pop music, what with coldplay, interpol and outkast all releasing gems.radiohead's ""hail to the thief"" is one of the best with a curious mix of the electronic experimentalism of ""kid a"" and the guitar rock of ""the bends."" the album grabs your attention from the first track and carries you all the way through with nary a lull. personal favorites are the building tension of ""sit down stand up"", the wonderful bang of ""there, there"", and the creepy quiet of ""the gloaming.""fans of previous radiohead albums will not be disappointed as the trademark poetic angst of the lyrics is in full force with the driving musical eclecticism of the music. newcomers will want to dig further into the discography."
2,The Emperor's New Clothes,"I'm sorry folks, but I have to step back and call it like it is-this album's simply boring and overrated, with the exception of the stand-out cut ""There, There."" I've tried to like it and gave it repeated listenings. A let-down from the edge and intensity of ""Amnesiac."""
2,over-rated,Don't get this horrible exuse for a great band. Like radiohead. GO BUY THE BENDS OR KID A..... BUT NOT THIS. there are hardly any good songs. geez radiohead.... MAKE GOOD MUSIC NEXT TIME
1,I tried!,"Unlike some other reviewers, I enjoyed the last two Radiohead albums and was looking forward to their next work. Unfortunately, after repeated listens, I have to conclude that ""Hail to the Thief"" is a disappointment on every level. The sonics are, as always, experimental and initially interesting, but the songs simply aren't there. ""Kid A"" and, to a lesser extent, ""Amnesiac"" still offered hooks under the layers of electronic noise. ""Hail to the Thief"" offers no real highs or lows; it just clatters by, failing to even create a sense of atmosphere. I forced myself to listen to this album several times in the hope it would eventually sink in, but not one song really sticks. It's premature to write Radiohead off creatively, and I'm sure that their live show remains one of the best out there. However, ""Hail to the Thief"" definitely represents the nadir of their achievement thus far."
5,Rock's brainy Brits' natural progression,"In my opinion, Radiohead attained greatness in 1997 with the sublime, conceptual Ok Computer, went off, successfully, in an electronica direction with Kid A and Amnesiac, and with this recording, Hail to the Thief, manage to blend their strengths as both songsters and sonic sculptors. In lesser hands, such an attempt would have resulted in incoherence. But with a brilliant band such as this, it's unlikely that they can do wrong, at least at the present moment. Instead, they have delivered a lush, brooding work of musical art."
1,Awful,This is truly awful stuff. Horribly cliched social commentary from liberals who don't know a democrat from Ann Coulter.
2,Not like normal Radiohead,"I was rather dissapointed with the new Radiohead CD ""Hail to the Theif"". Most of the music was reminiscent of techno and new age computer generated music, now I see why they singled ""There, There"" mainly because it was one of the few not totally digitalized songs on ""Hail to the Theif"". If you like songs from Radiohead like Creep, Karma Police, or pretty much any song off all of Radiohead's previous albums then you probably won't like ""Hail to the Theif"". I suggest going to a local store or your friend's and sampling the tracks. Most of them sound like the Radiohead song Ideoteque. I hope this review helps you, I didn't want to come out here and just shout and bash the album, I just wouldn't recommend it if you like old Radiohead."
4,The Definitive Curtis Mayfield Collective...Minus One!,"The only reason I am giving ths box set of the greatCurtis Mayfield 4 stars is because it is missing twojams that I love and that's...""Right On For The Darkness"",which was used in the 1995 film classic ""Dead Presidents""as well as ""Little Child Runnin' Wild"" which set the opening toneof his classic soundtrack ""Superfly"", which is where most of theyoung-headz know about him from!Other than that oversight, this is the definitiveportrait of a great artist whose music was influentialto alot of people and whose songwriting andlyrical skills inspired everyone fromBob Dylan to Bruce Springsteen...Stevie Wonder,Marvin Gaye & Sly Stone to Bob Marley!!Not to mention countless of millions who arediscovering and rediscovering his genius today!"
4,"You asked for it, well here it is","This book really hit home for me. Peterson provides some fundamental reasons as to why the black community has not reached it's full potential. We are the only race that has completely politicized our culture. In return we have recieved promises and rhetoric, and yet the chasm that seperates the black community grows wider.His assessment of our so-called leadership is also dead on. Unfortunately, many people will call him an ""Uncle Tom"" or self-hating black. However, one only has to honestly read the book, not from the perspective of politics, i.e. Democrats or Republicans, but from the perspective of honest self evaluation.An excellent read."
1,they must've run out of ideas and just kept with the noise,"Nothing like early 80's icelandic experimental punk, eh? Well, others like myself have probably all but knocked themselves out trying to find this rare CD featuring a pre-Sugarcubes punk Björk and all that. However, this was a really poor release from Kukl, especially in comparison to the fascinating ""Holidays in Europe"". It is NOT essential if you're into collecting things along this thread."
2,strong man + weak woman = irritating book,"I was really aggravated by this book. The main female character had no back bone. She blamed all her problems on one man, then solved them all with another. In this day and age, it's irritating to think that a grown woman can't deal with her boss, her door locks, and her life on her own. Maybe many many moons ago, but now? Enter the knight in shining armor to make everything all better. Not my idea of a good read."
3,mystery solved,"I'd like to clear up the mystery of the vanishing review. I wrote Handyman, and my son (13) was excited to see it on Amazon. He decided to write a review, glowing of course, but forgot he had signed in under my screen name. When the review was posted it appeared that I had written it. I was embarrassed, to say the least, and told him to fix the problem, which he did. But someone had already read it and was offended at what looked like blatant, and not very skillful self-promotion. Sorry. No offense intended. By the way, I am giving myself a rating of 3, because I have to fill in the field, and even though I believe Handyman is a good book, I didn't want to add to my offenses by giving it a 5. (Do you suppose I'll be able to laugh at this someday?)"
5,Great Read!,"This book was very touching. It kept you wondering what was going to happen next. If you like Nicholas Sparks try this one, that's how I came across it and I wasn't disappointed. I hope she does another book soon."
4,Funny and entertaining,"This book is good, clean fun. No sex, no violence, and no language. At times, it did drag but I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for an easy, entertaining read.Some of her characters are annoying and you wonder why Maggie would associate with them.You find yourself liking Maggie and her son Tim, hoping things will work out.Again, not a great read but enjoyable."
5,Cardcaptor Sakura Rules!,"This is my favourite anime. And after reading the last six manga in this series, i waited for Tokyopop to re-release the first six because i knew they would do it justice. i was very happy with the translation in the Master of the Clow series and i am happy they decided to re-do the original! Cardcaptor Sakura is Awesome! ^_^"
5,A slice of 80's NRG,"Perfect collection of 80s hi-energy songs all in their 12"" extended glory! A few of these extended mixes are not available anywhere else but on this disc. From the Sylvester-ish soul of Shawn Benson's ""Secluded"" to the quirky fun of Magazine 60's ""Don Quichotte"", you can't go wrong with this collection of fun NRG songs."
4,"My Bodyguard, has aged well","Along with a terrific cast this is a fun movie from the 1980s with decent clothes and music that doesn't age it badly. Backdrops are of Chicago and you see a couple scenes that Chicagoans will know like the loop, and the Picasso sculpture in the Civic Center Plaza. Several of the cast were kids then and have now grown including Makepeace, Baldwin, and Dillon. Be sure to keep an eye peeled for a young Jennifer Beals of ""Flash Dance"", not listed in the credits. This is a story about a new kid that is bullied for lunch money by a group of locals. In comes a very large and intimidating kid with stories of murder and mayhem that all the kids are afraid of but the new kid. He immediately approaches this large kid with a questionable past and ask him to be his bodyguard. It takes some convincing but he finally agrees. Don't miss this fun growing up movie. Good quality DVD with plenty of replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Charlie Bartlett"" and ""The Karate Kid"". - C. Luster"
4,"Liked it at 10, loved it at 33","... When I saw the My Bodyguard DVD ...I thought what the hell. I got home and was genually moved by it, and could remember all of it. This simple story of teen friendshipwithout gun play, thumping soundtrack, or computer imagery.The acting is good (great in the case of Matt Dillon), and yes there are some descrete hints that it may be more than friendship...A pity that its a bare bones release,..."
4,Very Good Movie,"I didn't care for this movie, the first time I saw it. I watched it a second time and I really liked it. Now I enjoy it every time I watch it. It is a good movie for teens."
2,It's a collector/display item - not a toy!,"I bought this boat as a toy but discovered it's really only made as a display piece. Here's what I wish I knew before I bought it:- First, I should have taken the product description more literally. When it says ""for collector's only"" that means that it's not designed to be used as a toy. It says age 8 and up but that's only if there's an 8 yr old content to leave it on a shelf.- The tin motor does function, but it's made from very thin/bendable tin and the fragile nature of it prevents it from functioning in water. Just the resistance of the water prevents it from spinning - when you lift it out of the water, it will slowly unwind.- The wood is very dense and when in the water, the bow actually dips below the water.- I don't think it was constructed with water-use in mind. After getting wet, the glue that holds the blue seats in the boat starts to soften and the seats will come off.Bottom line - it's a display item only - not a toy that can be used."
1,Terrible Purchase. Don't Buy It. Waste of Money.,This was very cheap and you get what you pay for. Item arrived with no battery and the pin fell out of the watch and the straps fell off. The pin falling out is a choking hazard and I just threw this thing right in the garbage. Save yourself some grief and buy something else.
1,people still believe this?,"All the lies about the germans in blegium throwing babies in the air onto their bayonets was all propoganda to enrage british soldiers and civilians into accepting entrance into a war which many of them would die horrible deaths. Both side had a hard time to get their troops to fight in the early stages of the war as there was little racial / national hatred between the germans and the english. Watch the history channel episode about christmas 1914 in the trenches and see if these are the same blood crazed barbaric germans that were bayonetting women and children. All of these claims have been discredited, I find it hard to believe people still waste their time writing books on it, and more incredible to find people wasting their time reading those books."
1,Politicized history,"While physically attractive, this book is very one-sided history by a writer who is known primarily for defending the Ottoman state against charges of genocide. If you are looking for a positive portrayal of the Ottomans from a nationalist Turkish perspective, look no further, but if you want an objective account of the late Ottoman period, you'd best look elsewhere.It is nonetheless interesting to see the same degree of partisanship displayed by the other reviewers below who rate this book highly: The reviewer ""Holdwater"" for instance, has (as I write this) written just eight reviews for Amazon. All are on the Ottoman Empire/Turkey and its relations with its Armenian and Greek citizens. He gives five-star ratings to the pro-Turkish books, and one-star ratings to books critical of Turkey or the Turks. His reviews are thus more propagandistic than even-handed assessments - a comment that also, unfortunately, applies to this book."
5,Truely an amazing story of devotion!,It doesn't sound as though Mr. Spence read this book.Writing a review would be just silly Mr. Spence!
4,"Love it, close to 5 stars.",This is a great disc and we really enjoy the variety of songs. Caravan is very energetic and comes much closer to Gypsy jazz than many other recordings from decades ago.
3,"If it works for you, great!","I can see some good points about this book but nothing like the other reviews I've seen. Well, sometimes one thing works for one and not another. I didn't think the description of how to put the core ideas and methods in the book into practice was particularly well done. To the author, (almost) every problem that anyone has ever had boils down to feeling ""I'm not worthy enough, I'm not good enough"" and I doubt the simplistic suggestions offered here will be of help to very many."
2,Over Used,"I bought this as a gift and was VERY embarrassed when the person I bought for opened it and fund writing on numerous pages. It was not advertized as being ""used and written in""."
1,**ZERO STARS***,"I love writing long reviews, whether they're positive or negative; however, some albums are just too bad to even warrant much of a review. ""Foxy Lady"" is one of them. The problem? First and foremost, there isn't a catchy or interesting tune to be found; dance music can feature notoriously silly or inane lyrics but these are TRULY AWFUL! Making matters worse are cheesy arrangements and the smarmy, self-satisfied vocals by RuPaul. An absolute and unmitigated disaster."
5,Such a Foxy Lady!,"I purchased a copy of ""Foxy Lady"" after having gotten copies of Ru's subsequent albums ""Red Hot"" and ""Champion."" The albums' two hit songs ""Snapshot"" and ""A Little Bit of Love"" were good chices as singles. I became instantly enthralled with the songs ""Snapshot"", ""A Little Bit Of Love"", ""Foxy Lady"", ""Party Train"" ""Snatched For The Gods"", ""Celebrate"", ""Delores"" and RuPaul's rendition of Diana Ross's hit ""Work That Body."" This albums' songs are well produced, written and sung! Recommended."
4,NJ Reader,I read this book after reading a review in an NJ newspaper. It was a little slow going in the beginning but once it got moving I really enjoyed it. It was a realistic story and Harry ended up actually getting hurt unlike many books where the hero is more like superman. I can see this book being the start of a series for this author.
2,A Disappointment,Perhaps the reviews set my expectations high but I agree with a few of the other readers in that this is a fairly ordinary book. This is a character driven story with a straight forward and predictable plot. It is certainly a quick read but it is the type of story that will be forgotten soon after completion. Average at best.
4,Save your voice in the classroom!,"For the cost, this has been an excellent product for use in my classroom. I would suggest using rechargeable batteries. Great for amplifying directions over busy classroom noise."
3,Buyer Beware,"Having also seen this movie in the theater (at least three times) and the original video release, the latest version of this rock-umentary is disappointing. Not only did I not notice any extra footage as was advertised, but several segments were editted down. Particular key highlights of the film (A Quick One and the very beginning of Won't Get Fooled Again) should have remained untouched! Real Who fans deserve better!"
4,DVD extras are omitted from this release,"First off, I'll say the the quality of the product, taken by itself, is very good. The picture quality is pretty amazing for a film that was cobbled together from all manner of sources: 35mm, 16mm and 8mm film, NTSC and PAL video, etc. The sound quality is strong, too.The reason I only give it four stars is because none of the extras that were on the second disc of the DVD release are available on the Blu-ray release. And there were tons of great extras.In short, if you already have the DVD, the Blu-ray is a must-buy because of the HD quality. But don't get rid of your DVD if you want the extra features. If you don't already have the DVD, you may need to get both if you want Maximum Who!"
4,A must for all Who fans,"I loved this movie when I first saw it while in high school. This blu-ray is not put together very well, though. The chapters menu doesn't allow you to move through several chapters at one time. If I want to get to chapter 24 I need to move through chapters 1 - 23 first. This is very annoying if I want to get to my favorite scenes quickly.No extras. You get an alternate audio track of the director's comments, but that has limited value.This wouldn't be my first choice for buying a blu-ray of this movie."
4,Hey - where's our Rick Danko???,"I loved the film - and would have given it 5 stars if Rick Danko had been in it, as advertised!"
5,"Cant explain, no pun intended","The dvd is amazing purchase, and hard to belive that people are actully selling it for under 7 dollars. The dvd package is great, the speical features are really worthwhile. The story lacks, but the live performances were a treat. I found in interviews, they are annoying and seemed to be drugged out of there minds. Couldnt they find better interviews? This dvd is a great buy, but if you want a complete story on a band-check out the Beatles anthology. The speical features on the Beatles lack, making the Who's speical features the winner. Anther problem I had is who did this band make it for over 14 years? They never seemed to talk to one anther, Pete Townshend hogged all the spotlight, Keith Moon interupted basically all interviews and said a wise remark; I wondered if Moon suffered for ADD or just was crazy like that."
1,Better off with washboard and beating clothes on rocks to dry,"Worst. Product. Ever. Nightmare. I was fine with it steam drying, expected clothes to be damp when they came out. No problem...WHEN THIS PIECE OF JUNK ACTUALLY WORKED ...which was barely ever. Motherboard. Drum, bering all needed replacement. Warranty company was awful, Haeir customer service even worse. Two different repair shops sent to fix it, both failed. Do yourself a favor and avoid this junkbox.If i could rate this a negative number I would."
3,short term solar cooker,"Using a solar cooker year after year requires a box constructed of material that will last. Cardboard does not. That's okay for short term or camping but if you want to use it regularly, it should be built of something like heavy wood. Ours is a wooden box with a glass top for prevention of bugs and dirt, then the reflector panels at the top. They are adjustable to catch the sunlight and the whole thing sits on a pole burried in cement. The box can be rotated to catch early or late sunlight which makes it usable for many hours. Too bad the author did not include some adaptable directions for a longer lasting solar cooker."
5,The way Introduction books should be...,"Mr. John Ray excelled in the making of this book. Simple approach, always comes back to the 'Real World' with examples and hinters. I highly recommend this book to anyone entering the field of Internet Protocols."
2,a very slow written story,My class had to read this book and write a report about it.It took me four times reading it to page 38 to the beginning until i understood it and could follow the story without falling asleep.It did help me understand why war is not a game and it got really interesting when they were in prison.I would not recommend this book to people who like suspence and killing because this book is as suspenceless as any book can ever get.
1,What A Load Of CRAP!,The book does not deal with the subject of sorcery at all rather its all about the subculture and the taking of drugs. As if we need another commission report on drug use or to tell us drugs are dangerous. Who cares that it affects their minds? All drugs affect the mind in one way or another. Hello?I found this to be an utter waste of my money![...]
4,Hare-brained humor for budding funny bones.,"What kind of rabbit climbed up a beanstalk? A Jack rabbit. This is a cute colorful book for kids who are just learning to appreciate telling and understanding jokes. There are a lot of plays on the word hare/hair. Not too sophisticated, but good clean humor for young-uns. There is one illustrated joke on each page. The text is easy to read and the pictures are bright and cheerful."
5,"I'll Take The Other Side, Here....","This is an utterly fantastic effort by Marshall Crenshaw. Historically, he's always been a terrific songwriter (both music and lyrics) and an expressive singer, but here he's evolving into something else again - a major talent on acoustic guitar. There are some wonderful moments (especially ""Better Back Off"") where Marshall shows off his newfound chops to great effect. The playing manages to be riveting, while never straying from service to the song - a neat trick in pop music. It's a rare treat to see a double threat (singer/songwriter) evolve into a triple threat (add player) and it's even rarer to see that pulled off as gracefully as Marshall Crenshaw manages here. The CD features a great setlist that is carefully re-worked to allow the playing to step forward. I know that others seem to have been disappointed in this release, but it's very possibly my favorite CD from one on my favorite musicians."
2,Way overrated,Did not come close to living up to the hype. Bill Murray was totally wasted in this film. Ferris was much better.
2,Don't believe the hype,"This movie has a lot going for it, including my all time favorite Bill Murray. But its not a Bill Murray movie. Its not even a slap your knee comedy. It gives you a wry smile every now and then, and a few smirks out of interesting scenes. Its a movie about a precosious(sic) kid and crush he has on Isabella and on the lonely man, Bill Murray. Its a story thats OK, but not as some say, great. If this was a drama special on TV, it would be great. But as a feature film that you sit down with refreshments and your family to watch excepting a hollywood produced film, well its just too small to please."
5,Wow.,"There are more fascinating characters in this film than in any other that I've seen in years. It's like a truly great play or novel: even the bit parts suck you in and make you really feel for their personalities. Rushmore is absolutely beautiful, there's no other way to descibe it!"
5,Rarest of movies,"Rushmore stands alone among movies about young teenagers at a time in their life when anything is possible. I know that sounds cliche, but how else could someone genuinely believe they could attract a woman twice his age who is a teacher at his school (Rosemary Cross)? If Max Fischer were a few years older, he would be considered delusional, but his age forgives his optimism.Bill Murray's character, Herman Blume, is an unhappy old man who can probably remember a time when he believed that things like money or family would make him happy. Max and Rosemary Cross manage to fill two voids in his life, love and the belief in things that can make his life worthwhile.If this were a stupid teenage fantasy movie, Max might actually get Rosemary to sleep with him, but it is far to smart for that. In the end, all three main characters benefit from knowing eachother, even if it was not the way they wanted."
2,Take out Max Fischer and you have a good movie...,"After watching the brilliant Royal Tennebaums, I felt I should watch Anderson's earlier effort, Rushmore. Every character is lovable except for the main character Max Fischer. He is an obnoxious jerk who doesn't get punched nearly enough. I can't undrstand how the other characters could put up with his rudeness, arrogance, and all around terrible personality. Also, there is no way he would have survived in a public school. They would have crushed him. I love teh Royal Tenebaums, but this movie left me waiting for Max's defeat that never came."
2,High-minded gobbledegook,"After reading the reviews here, I could not wait to see Rushmore. I tried to place the hype out of my mind while watching. I was thoroughly disappointed. Yes, Jason and Bill acted their parts well. But that isn't saying much considering their roles were those of completely unlikable people. The plot was lame lame lame and without merit. What troubles me even more is the number of people who would rate this film as a ""Classic"". Hogwash. The extras are interesting, but it is difficult to be interested in extras when the film is completely uninteresting to begin with. Rushmore was a dud. Watch it once. But be most entertained by reading the reviews here."
5,Rushmore,This movie is funny as all get out. The guy who called it 'painfully boring' is a big jerk.
1,Not great!,"Before I watched this movie I checked out the reviews for it.I thought it looked pretty good, but I was very disapointed. I almost turned it off a couple of times but I did watch it all the way through. I didn't think it was funny at all, I thought Max was obnoxious. In fact the whole movie didn't ring true. My husband also disliked this film and so did my teenage daughter. What a waste of time!"
1,"Make it stop, mommy!","Perhaps my sense of the artistic is in my other pants, but I can think of few things I wouldn't rather do than see ""Rushmore"". I can't really say that anything was wrong with this movie, because absolutely nothing was ever right with it. The acting was overdone, the script pathetic, the premise without interest and the movie utterly lacking in point. Frankly my opinion can be summed up by one statement: When I got home from this movie I took out my ticket stub, tore it up, burned it, and then spit on the ashes."
5,I just love all of Wes Anderson's movies,"The autobiographically inspired story is uplifting despite some darkness. The score is rich. Typical ""heightened reality"" type movie with very good acting from Bill Murray and others."
4,Very entertaining,"I'll start right off the bat by saying this movie is not for everyone. It takes a certain sense of humor to appreciate it. I found it very witty, smart and hilarious. Suprisingly good."
5,Quirky and great,"Rushmore is a movie about friendship and the strains it can have. Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) attends a prestigious prep school because his mother got him in. Even though he's in every extracurricular club, he's failing his classes. It's ironic because he's brilliant and could get all As if he wanted to. Bill Murray is Harold Blume, an alumni of Rushmore. He befriends Max and gives him a role model. Things change when they fall for the same schoolteacher (Olivia Williams). Other stellar characters are Max's protoge and his wise barber father. I liked Max's precocious self and his relationship with Blume. This is not you typical comedy and may not seem that funny at first. Bill Murray is not in your typical slapstick role. But if you sit and think about it, you will realize that it's hilarious."
2,"Great music, unlistenable recording quality","I realize original recordings from this era require a more forgiving ear, but in this case the noise is far greater than the signal. Fortunately, the recent re-recordings offer an alternative."
3,Amazon again lists incorrect item description/photo,"Seems Amazon often ""piggy backs"" listings and arranges with a poor vendor to send SOMETHING, whether or not it fits Amazon's photos and/or descriptions.These tweezers are visually similar to the photo and description for a different 3rd party vendor's product. These tweezers are fine but do not have horizontal grip ridges nor inside grooves in the tips. OK for my use, but maybe not for everyone.Point is Amazon is getting lazy, sloppy or deceitful too often and does not listen to corrections for their listings. I have tried to correct at least 2 other seriously faulty listings and was told I didn't prove any errors..."
3,Works fine,"You can hear the difference with out this. You need to have one for each channel. They are small enough to zip tie behind the head unit in the dash, but the cables are too short to leave you much room when fiddling with the stereo outside the dash.Are your patch cables colored red & white? Make sure you have the polarity correct. Also make sure your amperage is high enough. These are 15 amps, which work fine in my system with a 300 w amp."
4,Great pop punk!,I found this band on emusic.com and am definitely going to buy the CD! For a bright pop punk sound Yesterday's Kids are it. The melodies and vocal harmonies are true to the genre but are not tedious and qyuite inventive as are the lyrics. I've been listening to this non-stop for about 2 weeks.
5,Lovely Gift,"This is a very nicely packaged and reasonably priced item. I gave it to my mother for Christmas 2007, and she loved it. The pasta was so fragrant that we had to hold the dog back to keep him from tearing into it himself."
2,This album does not stand for the glorious Sarah and smart Schifrin,"Ok. Great songs, extraordinary singer, intelligent arranger!What if I tell you things didn't work?Lalo Schifrin is the famous Argentinian arranger and composer of great music for the movies and TV like 'Mission Impossible'.What to say about Sarah, maybe the most gifted of all American songbirds?!A neglectable album unless you are a big fan of both."
2,Mine broke like all of the others,"When this player was working I really enjoyed it and was happy with it (reason for 2 stars instead of 1,) however, this machine after very little use decided one day to stop working for no reason and is now gathering dust in the basement. I've had other DVD players (cheap models) that have worked for years with no issues..I EXPECT MUCH MORE FROM SONY... Read the other reviews..just like mine, this machine breaks after a short time of use."
3,Good (at first),"This DVD player lasted just over a year before it died. The first sign of trouble started a few months ago when the door would stick. All it took was a slight tug with a fingernail to open it, and eventually the problem stopped. Two nights ago I was watching a movie when it suddenly stopped playing. I could turn the player off and on, but when I pushed play all I heard was a grinding noise (a louder variation then the player has made since I got it). I turned it off and let it sit for a day just for giggles, but that didn't help. Before this, the player was fine. It took longer to load movies than most, but not by more than a few seconds. Definitely not the quality and durability I expected from Sony."
1,More a biography of the authors life,"The author spends too much time talking about her experiencesand her spirit guide and little on development.more like a propaganda to her self, did not like it muchdid not learn anything."
4,Mood brightener,"I had already bought ""Martini Lounge"" from the Pottery Barn store, and I was looking for CDs in the same style. I'm not disappointed by my purchase of Cocktail mix vol 1, 2, and 3. Although the volume 1 is sometimes a bit cartoon like, they all are very pleasant to listen to, with a good mix of jazz standards, and other types of music. They really brighten up your mood, and are suitable for parties, overall fun and lively."
5,Groovy cocktail lounge fun!,I wanted to make a special 'Cocktail' section for mi i Pod and found this to be a lot of fun. Some great old classics here! Spice up your next suave do with some hip shaking fun!
3,"Excellent, but poorly packed for shipping.","Excellent cookies. They were fresh, but every tin had many broken wafers, which did not allow me to serve them as I had planned. The tins should had been packed more tightly in the shipping carton, so that the tins would not have moved around in the carton."
4,"Very good, if you can find a copy","I found this book at the local library and picked it up on a whim. It's very good, and I highly recommend it if you can find a copy. Like another reviewers said, it doesn't include details about how air traffic control is done, but instead paints a picture about what it's like to BE a controller, particularly in the 80s before and after PATCO's strike. There are some great near-miss stories and tales about eccentric controllers that are some of my favorite parts of the book."
5,Waiting for Kilmer's next book!,"I logged on to see if anything is listed as forthcoming from this tremendous writer. I first picked up one of his books at my library, noticing the word ""squirrel"" on the cover - and I was hooked. While I immediately learned he offered nothing on squirrels, his human characters are portrayed with warmth, humor and intelligence. Searching for more by Kilmer after going through his mysteries, I read A Place in Normandy. Now I want he and his family to continue on with their personal lives so warmly and humorously shared, but I do hope he leaves some time for writing!

4,As Good as the original?,"Originally released as ""Gigantis, the Fire Monster"", GRA is a sequel to the original ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters"". While no monster flic compares, GRA comes in a pretty decent 2nd place. The story is, of course, hokey but you expect that. This time around, Godzilla is pestered by the Angrius monster and a classic battle ensues. The effects are pretty good for this ""man in the rubber suit"" presentation. There is some attempt at character development, but the monsters are the story here. I'm a bit curious as to how Godzilla resurrects, considering he was 'killed' in the original version. Maybe the oxygen destroyer didn't work as well as they thought? In any case, give GRA a viewing - it's a good efforts. Special note: As with the original ""Godzilla"", the original Japanese version is the only one to watch. The story changes considerably."
5,very nice.,"A crucial and entertaining entry in the Godzilla series. Technically and actually the SECOND Godzilla movie, this movie is well acted and the monster fight scenes are VERY well done. I had a blast watching it for the first time recently (I am a long time fan who just never saw this film), and I have to recommend it with the full force of my intensity.I am sure that even non Godzilla fans would appreciate this mega gem. Watch/buy it today!Plus, it's really the first time we see Godzilla fight the other monsters. This movie features Anguirus as the nemesis. Wonderfully done and very tasteful.Special effects are top notch for the 50s, and some even look very good by today's standards. Word.5 out of 5. My highest recommendation."
3,godzilla raids again,"to be honest, i thought i was gonna get more outta this movie. i was soooo disapointed! it was nothing comparded to the original! but the dvd is a extremly good dvd, it just has everything,audio commentary and features, english and japanese version with subtitles. i only recomend it to collectors and people who want all godzilla movies."
4,Godzilla returns,"The follow up to the 1954 classic, Godzilla Raids Again pretty much laid the ground work for the rest of the series. I gave it a 4/5 only because the box is much smaller than the box for Gojira, and the picture above is quite decieving. Normally I wouldn't care, but when it's being displayed atop my TV, it looks kinda funny with 2 different sized DVD cases."
4,The 2nd Godzlla movie and The last to be Black and White.,"I love this film, it rocks, i first saw it on TV, but i lost the Video i taped it on. Bad dubbing but well made Monster movie and the first to have fight scenes in it. The story has The G man fighting a new monster and like the first film, attacking the city (Osaka). It played on a double bill with TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE in the U.S.A.1955. Warner Brothers (U.S.A.)/Toho, Co, Lit. 82 MINS (Cut to 78 Minutes).Unrated. (Violence)."
3,Not what I expected,"While I will take any Swedish book I can get, since there are not very many, this book was not what I expected. It is old and not organized well... It is for very early beginners, and was not very difficult at all.However, it was good in some aspects. It has some exercises for you to do and such. It is worth a buy, but just keep in mind it is for very early beginners, and it is not as concise asEssentials of Swedish Grammar, which is the best book I have seen for Swedish Grammar."
4,Adesso Black Mini PS/2 Keyboard,Very nice keyboard for it's size. Fit very nicely in the space I had for it. Seems solidly built.
5,The Shield STILL Delivers,"This series has gone and blown away the mold of the police drama. Soars FAR above everything else that is currently out there. By the time Vic and the strike team are through, police shows will never be the same. This series is a must for anyone who is starving for unpredictable, unprecedented action/drama/excitement. It is never what it seems. The Shield comes at the viewer from so many different directions that it keeps the viewer guessing to the end of each and every episode. I can only give this series the HIGHEST possible recommendation!"
5,Holy Smoke,"I grew up in L.A so I am always interested in the stories that surround the city of my soul. This is the season that I first saw an episode of one night flipping chanels and just had to see the whole thing. So I bought all the seasons available and climbed aboard for the ride of my life. This show is not for the faint of heart or the seekers of moral high ground. It is just hard core and fast the ""six flags"" of cop shows. This was my favorite season. We all knew Glenn Close was good, but in this she was great. If your stomach can take it, this season will keep you on the edge of your seat!"
5,The Cure for All that Ails You,"One thing you can always count on with ""I Love Lucy"" is an escape from whatever might be depressing you. Well, THE I LOVE LUCY BOOK is exactly the same, except you can make it last for hours and hours of laughter and giggles. You can also read it for the background information of the actors and the show's development but ""The Handy Dandy Episode Finder"" is most wonderful because you can look up your favorite episode by key word like ""wine vat"" or ""icicles"" or ""chocolate."" I have a feeling I will be picking this book up again at times, just as I search for a Lucy episode when tired of feeling blue."
2,I love lucy but not this book,"This book has a lot of information in it, however it was information that I already had heard. There are no really juicy inside stories but if you've heard nothing about the relationships of the actors then you'll like it. You can relive every Lucy episode and learn some of the technical aspects of the show but chances are you know most of what is in this book. Then again, to some, the pictures of Lucille Ball might be worth the price anyway."
1,Fading on first wash,"Not happy with this item. Washed it inside-out and in cold water and hung to dry. The big number 12's both faded as did Rogers name. Low quality product, not recommended."
2,Doesn't protect against seepage,"While I like the feel of these band-aids, we found the other night that blood will seep right through the sheer layer. Not so useful..."
5,"Excellent and priced right, what's not to love!?","Excellent price and great quality, if your looking for non sterile swabs do not hesitate! When I need more I will not think twice about order these again."
1,Very Disappointed,"I wish I hadn't bought this CD. It sounded promising but has been a big disappointment. The songs are not very child oriented and some are just negative, especially the Don McLean song. There are many other good CD's...this one is not worth the money."
4,Another Perspective,Length:: 0:28 MinsThis is kind of a test. Check out the review I made and let me know what you think. Honestly this book really is a valuable perspective on the current pace of change in the world. Visit my blog [...] for other book reviews.
3,An EXCELLENT reference source....,"This is an excellent book. If you are looking for a reference source concearning the above mentioned philosophies and religions this will be a valuble resource. Its only MAJOR flaw is that it is not reader friendly. If you don't know ANYTHING about Hinduism, Taoism, Buddhism or Zen you should not buy this book. There are other books more simple yet thorough and enjoyable enough to satisfy the ""beginner"" on this subjet matter, such as ""World Religions"" by John Bowker (The only flaw of THIS book is that it is thin, rectangular and long in shape....not bookshelf freindly). If you think(being COMPLETLY honost with yourself) you know enough about the subject matter to purchace this book, then you PROBABLY are right and should get this book."
3,Terrible Customer Service,"Good socks, but the customer service of this company sucks!I called them because one pair of socks came with a hole in it and they never bothered to send me another pair as they promised!"
4,A nice encapsulation of Andrews' early career,"This retrospective is a nice encapsulation of Julie Andrews' early career. The best tracks are Julie's ""Simple Folk"" duet with the charmistic Richard Burton from CAMELOT, her clowning with Carol Burnett on ""Big D"" from their 1962 Carnegie Hall TV Concert, and the numbers from her star-making role as Liza Doolittle in that dream of a show MY FAIR LADY. But then Hollywood came along, and she was typecast for two decades after MARY POPPINS and THE SOUND OF MUSIC. Julie Andrews has always been more versatile than her critics, and many of her fans, have given her credit for. She really deserves the Big Box Set treatment, like those given divas Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand,--one that includes songs from her neglected movies STAR! and DARLING LILI, as well as her Academy Award nominated ""Le Jazz Hot"" role, VICTOR/VICTORIA."
2,"Unfortunately, very weak.","I understand Dave's effort to make a solo record, and I admire it in some small way. However, this simply does not cut it. This album is truly disappointing and fails to spark the same feeling that Martin Gore's solo album does. The music is simply un-interesting. I'm getting tired of reading reviews from all these Depeche fanatics that will praise ANYTHING released by the members of Depeche Mode. Do not listen to them - this album sounds NOTHING like DM.Why did I give it two stars and not one? Because a couple of tracks on this record are decent - 'Bottle Living' and 'Black And Blue Again'. Obviously, two songs are simply not enough to make a strong record. If you are looking for some really mellow tunes to listen to (and that is the only thing this album provides), purchase Martin Gore's album 'Couterfeit 2'.Dice"
2,"Looks nice, but that's it. Dangerous.....","We bought two of these for our home. I wish we hadn't wasted our money. Had to buy better ones to replace these. I agree with the other reviewer that if you tighten it too much, the you have problems with the latch opening and closing properly, but if you loosen it slightly, the whole thing can be pushed by yourself or a curious toddler. Not to mention what I consider the worst defect - there is a frame of wood at the bottom that you have to step over each time you cross the gate. Everyone who has been to our house has tripped over this at some point. I have tripped carrying my baby and have almost lost platefuls of food. My 16 month old trips over it when I do let her out of the room. You're better off getting a gate that is either hardware mounted or doesn't have a bottom frame."
2,Don't Buy,"This book does not meet the needs of a warehousing Adminstrator. The author assumes that the warehousing administrator does not know warehouing and oracle fundamentals. Part I & Part III of the book info can be found in oracle manuals. Part II contains practical issues, but also can be found in performance tuning manuals"
5,works great,This trimmer works very well does everything that is needed . This is a great product buy it if you need it !!
1,completely useless,"Swingline Classic Cut Ingento 12 Inch Maple Guillotine Paper Trimmer, CL500m - 1132is completely useless.Its incapable of cutting even one sheet of copy paper.I returned it the same day it arrived"
4,Very entertaining!,"These comic artists are an odd, and interesting lot. The film does a good job of gently prying open their shells, shining a little light inside, and giving us a peek into their wonderfully quirky, all too human selves."
1,Junk,These are junk. I put on my car and the car shook violently when braking. I put different ones on and the shaking disappeared. Unsafe.
4,Better than the reviews suggest!,"This book took me from being a SQL novice (let alone a PostgreSQL novice) to being able to being able to use PostgreSQL for business apps.I'm not quite sure why some reviewers knocked it. It has much more content than the FAQ, good examples and a reference section.One reviewer knocked the reference section, claiming the book was half full of appendices... in fact the reference section is what you most often go to the book for after you've worked through the basic concepts in the first section.I think the layout is slightly odd - the examples of commands and their results are grouped together in sections that are usually a page or two ahead of the text that explains them. So you spend a bit of time flicking pages to see examples. But once you get the hang of this style it's not exactly the biggest pain in the world.I think it's a very good book, one that took me from being a SQL beginner yet is still useful as a day to day reference.Lee"
5,Wagner: Der fliegende Holländer,Wagner: Der fliegende Holländer is a truly astounding recording with the legendary conductor Otto Klemperer. The sound quality is so good that one actually feels as if one was present at the recording of this back in 1968. EMI have produced a quite big book-let (154 pages). The essay written by Richard Osbourne is informative and well-written. The photographs are a bit grainy but one has to bear in mind that they were taken almost 40 years ago and cameras were not as good then as they are now. The entire text is there in two languages (English and French). This is a recording not to be missed. 5 well deserved stars.
1,Unsatisfactory,"I bought a 100 pack of these about a year ago and approx 10% of the disks were bad. I assumed I just had a bad batch as all products can have occasional flaws. I then bought a package of store brand disks at Staples, and had no problem.I figured that the other batch was just a fluke. Yesterday I was needing some disks, so I bought another batch of the Verbatim printables at Sams Club. The first two disks in the pack were bad. I returned them this morning and received a refund. I then bought a 100 pack of Memorex and they work fine.I have used other product lines of Verbatim CDs and DVDs without a problem. It just seems to be the Verbatim printable that I've had problems with."
4,nice mix of performers for W Nelson bday,Had already seen the birthday party on videotape and decided I wanted the music. Good mix of songwriters with W Nelson and of performers with songwriter Nelson.
4,Heavy,"Only had my skillet in use for a month or so, used it maybe 5 times. I really do like it. The sides are a smidge tall for my taste, but will really increase the food capacity. Interior non-stick surface seems to be durable, and all connections and the cord seem to be high quality. It is a rather heavey item though."
1,Poor customer service,"I purchased this router in May. It's now the end of July and I still do not have a working router. Bountiful has my defective one and seems incapable of either telling the truth or sending me a new router.I was told I would have one cross shipped to me by bountiful after Amazon refused to honor the warranty. That didn't happen.I was told by bountiful then that they had my router ready to ship to me immediately. after 4 days, I called and asked where my router was and was told that a supervisor at bountiful had cancelled my router and sent the unit to some other customer.I have now been told that bountiful is overnighting a router to me. We'll see.Do yourself a favor and never buy anything from this company unless you want to throw money away."
1,Don't buy it!!!,"I bought this router for the promises of distances of a quarter mile even though I just wanted it to connect straight out the window about 75 yards a way in another building. Not only in the end did the router not even go the distance, the installation was thoroughly disappointing and not even remotely up to par with other brands. Some parts of the manual don't work if you are using MAC, the auto run for the mac does not work, and once you get the instructions working, they are confusing, not detailed, and sequential. Then once you get it running the fan noise reminds of me my 1994, 486 computer. If you have a couple of hours to spend remembering the configuration old days where everything was manual, you don't mind that the range is no further than a normal router, you have over $250 to spend, and you don't want to hear the person on the phone because the fan is too loud then this router is for you."
4,A Good Book!,"+AH4-This book is not how he usually writes. He deals with killers and other stuff. Even though it's not his usual writing, it is still very good. This book deals with a girl's relationship with the ocean, and how she tries to save her special place under the water from her evil brother. It has alot of adventure so I would still recommend this book to Penchley fans.+AH4-"
5,Hard look at recovered memories,"For anyone interested in the ""recoverd memory"" movement, this is a must read. It is well-researched and hard-hitting. It approaches the field with a critical eye, and highlights the damage uncritical acceptance can bring. The stories of families torn apart are heart-breaking, and the stories of therapists engaging in fanciful conspiracy theories are chilling."
1,"Much Ado About Nothing, Redux","Yow. More hot steaming pap from the retro-rabid Cult of False Memoryists, the folks who're one step behind the Raelians--or is it one step ahead? If you're credulous enough to buy this book, get out a pound of salt, a grain just won't do. If you're the rational type, give it a Biiiig miss, and protect your neurons by saving your pennies for books that aren't the junk science equivalent of Biggie Fries."
3,This CD is on par with the last DM CD,"When I purchased this CD, I had high expectations, mainly b/c I was rather disappointed DM's last offering, Exciter. It didn't take long to realize this CD is very much like Exciter and that the hard-driving techno/mod sound that made DM such a cult group does not really exist anymore. Dave's vocals are great. Tunes such as ""Bottle Living"" and ""I need you are"" very good, but the writing could be a little more sophisticated. Satisfaction may never be found with any band members solo projects or even future DM releases because the sound fans are really longing for is history."
4,Well-worth it!!!,"So I was driving home one day and heard a song called 'Dirty Stick Floors' on the radio. I was instantly mesmerized by the catchy beat and hooks and those sensual vocals and knew I had to go find out who was behind it. Should have guessed it was Dave Gahan.Next day, I bought the album and it's been in my car ever since!.My favorite tracks are of course ""Dirty Sticky Floors"", ""Hold On"", and ""I Need You"".Every time I listen to ""Dirty Sticky Floors"", it sounds so brand new all over again, like I'm listening to it for the very first time!!!."
1,"I'm trying to like it, but...","I really want to like this CD but I'm having a hard time with it. The lyrics are trite and much of the music is boring. Although I suppose it could be called mood music I just can't get into the mood for it. Maybe it'll grow on me. Probably not.I wasn't expecting Depeche Mode, but I wasn't expecting it to be so dreary and uncompelling either. The title track is ok, as are a couple of other tunes (the lyrics are still bad), however the remaining tracks go nowhere, slow. Especially Bitter Apple, which sounds like it's ready to fall apart as you're listening to it.This CD is the aural equivalent of a ghost written book where the top-billed writer poorly wrote nothing of substance and the ghostwriter's job was to clean up the mess and make it coherent.It's destined for the bargain bin."
5,Impressive debut,"Quite an impressive debut. The album is a bit lower-key than I expected, but it is still intriguing enough to carry throughout its entire length, plus ""dirty sticky floors"" is enough to make the album worth its value. I would have to call this the best album of 2003, so far. It even blows the white stripes out of the water."
3,Doesn't move on the beach. Used as a utility cart.,"I bought this cart one year back based on many positive reviews here. On our vacation to Florida, I've had hard time pushing this cart on the beach. It doesn't move in the beach sand. I didn't even put much stuff in it. I give zero stars for it's use as a beach cart.I give 3 stars for it's use as a utility cart. I use to carry groceries etc from the garage of our apartment to home upstairs through elevator. Just a few days one of big wheels came off rendering it completely useless."
1,Terrible,This game is the worst game I ever played because when you are turning it is so hard to turn. Don't waste your money like I did.I MEAN DON'T BUY IT.
5,Just perfect,This gets the job done it works beautifully and holds 3 clarinets(only comes wih 2 for clarinet and 1 for flute)....... But Its nice I recommend for all clarinet users that have no stand for their instrument
1,ARABIA 3D,I OWN ABOUT 50 3D MOVIES AND DOCUMENTARY 3D. I WILL HAVE TO SAY THIS IS THE ONLY ONE THAT I DID NOT LIKE. THE 3D IS OK BUT THE CONTENT WAS NOT ONLY BORING BUT SPENT TOO MUCH TIME TALKING AND PRAISING THE MUSLIM'S AND NOT ENOUGH TIME JUST SHOWING AND TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE ANCIENT RUINS AND THE LAND.I HAVE PROBABLY 10 OF THE IMAX 3D DVD'S AND THIS ONE DOES'NT MEASURE UP TO THOSE.
4,Good Stuff,"This is a great buy, just watched it on home theater (200 inches screen) & I must say the visuals & sound quality were exceptional. The content was also profound, contained plenty of little-known facts about the area & it's people. The Arabic music & singing in the background were also very haunting. The only drawback was that the DVD finished too soon"
1,Unplayable and a waste of money,"I am a high school student with 6 years of experience on clarinet and I play in five different ensembles including highly selective school and community orchestras/bands. I normally use Vandoren V12 3.5s, with a Vandoren M15 mouthpiece on an older Buffet R13.I typically throw away half of the reeds in a box as soon as I open it, and would love to find a synthetic reed that would last longer than the cane reeds. We were disappointed by the Fibracell. I tried out the Fibracell 3.5 reed with my teacher, a professional orchestral clarinetist. We determined that the 3.5 was soft, played out of tune, and with bad tone. It also is not possible to play the highest notes on the instrument using this reed. (The highest I could get was to altissimo G or A.)In short, this is a disappointment and a waste of money."
1,This is the worst case you could buy,"I bought this case when I got my PSP almost a year ago. I traded it back in within about 2 weeks. The design seems ok at first, but you're taking your chances. Luckily, I learned this a foot from a harder carpeted floor. If it accidentally falls, the latch fails--the case pops open, and your PSP goes sliding across the floor. It would have been worse for mine had it been an uncarpeted floor. I would suggest getting a zippered case instead--this design does not have sturdy enough protection for your system."
5,Great protective case,This case is great lock in tight doesn't move in the case easy to put in and out of case even with the tight case fit. it has a black foam inside that helps protect you PSP. You really can accidently drop this and it will protect your PSP I did it believe me... not one problem the case didn't even break. That says alot to me sence I drop alot of stuff all the time I went though my share of cell phone because of it.
1,Not for new PSPs,"This is a great case for an OLD PSP. The PSP 3000 not only fits loosely in it, but the cut outs are different so that you cannot access the headphone port while it's in the case. I have this case that the PSP 3000 does fit in (I guess it's the SLIM version that isn't available) and it's wonderful. I bought this one for my kid's PSP and lost my money, thinking it was the same case - bought from a third party, and threw away the wrapping before checking. Don't buy it for a new version of the PSP - you'll regret it."
1,dONT wASTE yOUR mONEY!!!!,"IT WILL SCRATCH YOUR SCREEN LIKE YOU WOULDNT BELIEVE... I GOT IT FOR XMAS FROM MY SISTER AND I THOUGHT IT WAS AWESOME BECAUSE IT DOUBLES AS A STAND FOR WHEN YOU ARE WATCHING MOVIES... BUT IF YOU HAVE YOUR PSP IN THIS CASE IT WILL GET SCRATCHED!!!! THERE ARE ""CONVENIENCE"" OPENINGS FOR AC AND HEADPHONES AND SAND AND GRIT WILL GET IN SIDE AND STICK TO THE RUBBER LINING AND SCRATCH YOUR SCREEN BEYOND REPAIR!!! DO NOT BUY THIS CASE!!!"
2,Don't Be Fooled Like I Was,I bought this with the belief that the top was matte plastic and the sides were at least faux chrome if not real chrome. Ends up the entire thing is shiny clear plastic which the above photo does not let on at all. It shows every fingerprint. I do not like it at all.
4,Almost perfect.,"I bought this case along with my PSP and it is really great. It protects the PSP very well and is not too bulky.It is great if you bring your PSP along when you travel by train and plane, allowing for you to simply put the PSP in the top of your hand luggage and not worry about it getting scratched or smashed if your bag gets knocked around a little. Also, the fact that you can play with the PSP still in the case and not having to take the PSP out of the case and finding a place for storing the case while you play is great.The only thing keeping it from being perfect is that it is not compatible with the Logitech Playgear Visor so if you have that great protective screen you need to remove it when you use the Playgear Pocket. It is not that big of a deal, but it would have been nice to be able to use both the Pocket and the Visor at the same time."
5,Awesome,"I love this product! It works for every purpose I need it for. I compared this product with my buddy's generic case. This one is a whole lot better, by far."
4,Good Item,This item is great. Definately an item needed for every PSP owner to keep your system safe. Works great and keeps system clean also.
1,The Memphis Belle Deluxe Edition,First of all I thought it was the movie and second of all it won't play. I need to return it.Shari
2,Why would one want this?,"Why anyone would spend $500+ on this is beyond me. The cool thing about reverse macro work is that the mount is irrelevant (filter threads are universal, after all). What makes this universality especially nice is that there's a plethora of excellent used lenses from many manufacturers available for very little money. It perplexes me why one would need to reverse a specific EF lens. Just get a superb old Canon FD lens, or Nikkor, or Olympus Zuiko, or Pentax SMC, etc...That being said, I've tried this on a whim in a camera store, and it does work quite well (hence the two stars). But upon arriving home, I popped my old 50mm f/1.4 FD reversed onto my 1Ds Mark II and shot some optically stunning close-up work."
4,dries up pimples fasssssssssst,once u see a pimple coming you place this the night before and when you wake up the pimpmle is almost gone. you can only put it on at night because it dries white like chalk. its not a entire face application but a on spot treatment
2,Blemish stay,This product sounds good but didn't work. All it did was left pink on my face. Didn't dry up like the avon clearsil does.
4,It really works,"It works very quickly but I have noticed that if I don't use it every night until the pimples are completely gone then they tend to come back, as long as you stay on top of it every night it will work. It stings when you first put it on but it's worth it to wake up with clear skin the next day. I don't know if this is normal or not, but mine has sort of dried up (I bought it a few months ago). It dries out your skin pretty bad so make sure to use a good moisturizer or oil as well (coconut oil is a miracle worker and doesn't clog your pores)."
5,A very good book for every VB Programmers,Mr. Paul Sheriff expressed his knowledge very well in this book. I bought tons of VB books since I had my first Visual Basic class in 1996. I truly believe that he can really guide you in the right direction in VB programming.
2,Didn't Like It,"I was dissapointed with this book, it was the first one I started reading when trying to learn VB. It seemed the author spent more time pushing his own personal style of programming rather than teaching how VB works. I have sinced purchaced other books on the subject and am doing much better. Sry Paul but there is more then one style of programming and mine differs from yours. Also, the book keeps refering to certian files as if there was a CD that was supposed to come with the book. I had no CD and no evidence that one was ever there."
5,Thank you Amazon.....,"After seeing Jeremy Renner on the Oscars last night, I was reminded of this great (but now defunct) TV series....""The Unusuals""! Thinking I would never see the series again, I came across this while reading the latest on Jeremy on Wickapedia...that Amazon would be coming out with the DVD of this fanatastic show.Thank you Amazon !Why was this show ever cancelled in the first place??? Another really good series that saw only one season was ""Women's Murder Club"". I believe that was ABC, also! That series is from the books by James Pattterson.Well, we can be thankful for one thing...another series of this genre is looking quite successful and it's called ""Castle"". Let's hope ABC doesn't see this and move on to cancelling ""Castle""."
2,Try something else...,"I have used and enjoyed several ""for dummies"" books in the (somewhat distant) past. However, I found the amount of ""funny"" material in this book distracting. I had to skim to get to the information I needed - by buying a Dummies book I was hoping to SAVE time. I am using ""The Absolute Beginners Guide to Photoshop Elements 2"" instead and find it much more straightforward and helpful."
5,C# Unleashed,"This is one of the first books that I read on C#. I continually come back to this book when I want to get some information quickly. The explanations are very clear and the examples illustrate the concepts. Considering the huge size of Visual Studio.Net, no book can cover all topics in complete detail. That would require a set of volumes of encyclopedic dimensions.C# unleashed gives a Programmer with some background in a modernobject oriented language a pretty good idea of the C# languageand how it can be used. Another feature I like is the appendixwhich lists the command line compile options. These are alsoillustrated in the examples throughout the book."
5,This book is simply incredible,"Every body must read this book; it has everything a man or a couple is looking either to improve their sex life or their life as a whole. If you think you know how to make love to your partner, then dare to read this book!Thanks to Mantak and Douglas!"
5,So complete I never realized some of this music existed,"A wonderful 2 disc soundtrack of the film. I know GWTW like a second language, but I was pleasantly surprised to hear music that I never noticed before such as Charles Hamilton Challenges Rhett, and many other ""extended"" versions.Rudy Behlmer's liner notes are enlightening, informative, and make for interesting reading.Max Steiner enthusiasts, and soundtrack aficionados will relish this set."
3,Have had a year and still plays with it,"My son got this for xmas LAST YEAR and still plays with it. It's not super sturdy, so I thought it was going to break fast, but it didn't (and my son is very rough on toys). It takes most small Hot Wheels type cars, but some go faster than others. Check the label on the box and try to find the correct cars if you can.My son was 4 when he got it and is 5 now and still loves it. We got it at Kohls laast year for just $10."
2,So disappointed!,"I bought this for my son's 5th birthday. I've been disappointed with other flimsy tracks before but after reading the reviews, I thought this one might be different. When my son opened it for the first time, some of the hinges were missing and one actually had broken off on opening. It was not as sturdy as it had sounded. Perhaps if we didn't get a defective/damaged one, my review would have been different; the racetrack itself is a cool concept. I'm disappointed that it was broken upon opening and I caution potential buyers to tread cautiously."
2,"Very, VERY flimsy","I bought this, but soon returned it because it was so incredibly flimsy. My boys would have destroyed it in no time."
4,My kids love it,"Very simple and fun. My 4 year old son and 6 year old daughter love it. The kids can put up to 4 cars at the starting line, release them with a lever and they race to the bottom. There are 4 flags at the bottom which flip up when the cars hit them and show the order of the finish.Once you get the hang of it, it's simple to fold up for storage or travel.It's a little flimsy and durability could be an issue, and I think it's a bit pricey for what it is, so I knocked it down to 4 stars."
4,"Not the most durable toy, but tons of fun for little racers","My sons love this thing! It's so fun for them to try and figure out which types of cars and trucks will make it farther. They also love having elimination matches. No batteries, which is a huge plus, as I am emphatically anti-battery-operated toy. :)"
3,Fun but poor construction,"This toy is very fun for boys over 3 year of age. My son just got it for his birthday and absolutely loves it. It's great for sharing and playing together with other kids as well.However, for almost $60 the construction is very poor. The ""joints"" come apart way too easily, it's too lightweight and easily knocked over. It should be $35."
5,The best racetrack to buy!,My son is 9 years old and has had this race track for about 2 years. It is the ONLY racetrack he ever plays with. My 4 year old and 2 year old boys love it too. We've bought many race tracks and this is the only one that the pieces don't get lost and they love to play with it. My son takes it to his grandma's and all his cousins like it too. It is a toy that is still getting played with years later and that doesn't happen very much around here. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this toy!
2,Raceway,"There needs to be more support than what has been created. Due to the lack of support, the track is bend and cars will not always race down the track."
2,Great idea - poorly executed,"Like everything Mattel/Hotwheels seems to make these days, it's junky plastic with poor construction. My 3rd year old has fun with it and it's a great idea for a toy but it constantly falls over and the track comes apart easily so mommy and daddy constantly need to keep fixing it. Mattel, I would PAY MORE for something that wasn't junk - please improve the quality"
4,Great for Fans of the Original DiC Dub (1995-1996),"Those who first came to know and love the Sailor Moon series via the 1995-1996 DiC dub shown in North America will definitely recognize the songs on this CD. Listening to this CD now can be a bit of nostalgia, even for those who have gone forward in the Sailor Moon universe to see more of the series, films, and musicals (especially in Japanese).The main downfall of this CD, however, is that it does NOT include any music in Japanese - not even the original Japanese opening song ""Moonlight densetsu."" The likely reason for this is the flawed marketing campaign used for the original DiC dub: The marketing was targeted at young girls (2-11), but due to when the series was originally shown in much of the United States, it was really only older teenagers and college students with a STRONG interest in Japanese animation who got up early enough to watch and enjoy the series - only these diehard viewers would appreciate original Japanese-language music."
5,when sailormoon whose in thuolbe the sauots' had a veashun a,sailormoon whose in thuolbe the sauots' wanted to halp her but they cuold not wermeber will souran sauvav aull find out dot' go a way.
5,Sailor Moon is so cool!!!,"This CD rocks!!! My favorite songs are Rainy Day Man, Carry On, She's Got the Power, Sailor Moon Theme, Oh Starry Night, ect.ect.ect. Ok, I like them all!!! Princess of Jupiter"
4,Ohayo Minna!!,"I for one think that this is a kawaii (cute) CD. It may not be as great as the ORIGINAL JAPANESE CD's (the many, many cd's of SM) but it's still great, especially for those who aren't much into anime, but are starting off with SM. I would like to encourage those who absolutely love SM, to consider watching the original Japanese series, subtitled of coarse, because it's sooo much better, and it allows you to see the many mistakes made when dubbed. -.-; It's also great because you get to see all the 200 eps, rather than the first 40-50, and then repeat again. PS: Sailor Moon Sailor Stars is THE best season you'll ever see, but SM S is great also, because you get to see KAWAII Sailor Saturn, Hotaru-chan! >.< Oh yeah, and Sailor Neptune, Uranus, and Pluto.. ^_~"
2,It's in english...,... the real Sailor Moon music is in Japanese. The original language. Compare The Power of Love to La Soldier and see what wins. Spend your money on an import. 'nuff said.Professor Tomoe Souichi from Sailor Moon Super
5,"The BEST ""english"" anime songs!!","This is a great cd!! It has 10 songs, spaning all of Sailormoon and most of Sailormoon R. My favorite tracks are ""Carry On"" (from: Day of Destiny) & ""Rainy Day Man"" (from: A Knight to Remember). In my opinion, ""Pretty cool, but the Japanese songs will always be better..."""
5,The Sailor Moon CD is great.,"This CD is not only for children, it had lyrics that are good for use today. I really enjoy this CD. I find myself humming the words when i listen to it. All my friends want one, so I will tell them where they can get one. Right on their home computer!"
4,Totally Awesome,"This has all the favorites from the show. I took off 1 star because off the different version of ""Only A Memory Away"". If you love the NA dub's music, this is the CD for you."
3,Realistic,"The main characters battle with anorexia and her need for control and organization were so incredibly realistic,it is just AMAZING...(TRUST ME...)."
3,So-So,"This is not a representative Mingus CD for the period. It has none of his compositions or arrangements, and he doesn't even take a solo. Compares favorably with other live CDs perhaps, or ones on which Mingus performs as a sideman, but a live CD with more Mingus influence, see Revenge! or At Antibes. The studio albums Changes One and Changes Two are from about this same period and show what he was really up to in those days. If you are a Mingus collector, At Carnegie Hall shouldn't be a high priority, unless you have just about every thing else."
2,"Good Book, but poorly edited.","I was very anxious to receive this book, however, there are multiple instances in the book where either the content does not continue to the following page, i.e., page 90 for example. The sentence is cut-off mid-way and does not continue on to the following page. There is also instances where text is written twice, also on page 90. Page 89 there is another instance where the paragraph ends mid-sentence and does not continue on. It's extremely frustrating since I spent $70 on this book.DO NOT BUY."
5,The new old school,"I first became interested in Money Mark after discovering he did the original music for the reality show family bonds.I knew him from the beastie boys playing that old school ""car wash"" funk.I loved the album being a Funkster and composer myself.Each track has a different surprise.I must admit I did not care for his earlier solo album but I hope to hear more of this stuff in the future.Great for a party."
4,Tastes Great But Way Too Much Salt,"I give this 5 stars for taste, but 3 stars for way too much salt, hence the 4 star rating. It contains 510mg per serving (4 servings per can). But it does taste very good."
5,Good Value,"These clippers work very well. I cut my husband's hair, and these clippers are much more heavy duty than others I have used. Even if his hair gets too long they still cut very well."
3,Good...but Not Dwight at his best...,"This CD proves an enjoyable listen on the whole, and is certainly better than most of the junk in country music these days....but it really is only second-tier Dwight. There are a few standout cuts on this one: 'The Late Great Golden State,' 'Exception to the Rule', 'If Teardrops Were Diamonds' and 'Trains,Boats and Planes'. Most of the remaining songs are enjoyable, but either get bogged down in cliches and wordplay (which brings it a little to close to 'normal' country music), or suffer from music that has you saying ""Haven't I heard this song before on one of his other albums?"". It's a worthwhile addition to anyone's Dwight collection, but newcomers should start with This Time, Gone, or Guitars Cadillacs."
5,Here to stay . . .,Yet another example of why Dwight will continue to stay relevant long after most of his contemporaries have fallen by the wayside.
5,Dwight did it again1,"This is another great CD filled with great music. Dwight's twang and great spirit with help from Pete Anderson, Skip Edwards, Scott Joss, Gary Morse,and Bob Glaub. From the first song ""The Late Great Golden State"" to ""The Back Of Your Hand"" and all the ones in between ""No Such Thing"" wonderful song that makes you want to dance, ""Fair to Midland"" about a man searching for his lost love , ""An Exception To The Rule"" a song you want to play over and over , ""Population Me"" a very deep song, ""Stayin' Up Late [Thinkin about it]"" also makes you want to dance, ""Trains and Boats and Planes"", ""If Teardrops Were Diamonds"" sung with Willie Nelson, ""I'd Avoid Me Too"" LOVE this one, ""The Back Of Your Hand"" a wonderful song that Dwight found while working on a movie set. A Wonderful CD. Every song on this CD has a spirit of it's own. I love!"
3,Modern Chronicle,"Like other readers, I've been disapointed by many aspects of this book, but I've read it three times, the whole way. And every time I found something which makes me respect the book and it's author.Even thought the book was published in '89 and tells a story that took place in the late 60's, the main character's behavior looks very modern. ""Kurt"" life is not that far from the one many men I met are still living, in 2007. I believe it tells a lot about how gays live their life and about how others, including gays and straights, judge them.How come such a ""bad book"" could be so accurately a description of actuality?Make your own opinion, don't trust frustrated readers..."
4,Advocate who was master of money and the theatrical approach to the courttroom,"I purchased this book because I read it once when I was a small boy, was mesmerised, and could never again find a copy of. It stayed in my mind all down the years. Its style is dated now, but the subject matter is fascinating because Leibowitz was a brilliant, and a mass of contradictions. I would recommend it to anyone interested in biography, and anyone interested in how the world of legal advocacy has changed"
1,Third book BORES.,"I really enjoyed the first two installments of this trilogy and actually this book wasn't bad until about chapter 6. I don't know if there was a writer change, an editor change or what but the book TANKS badly. Poorly written from there out. Characters... well, plain out of character. It does the job of closing the series for sure but I was rather disappointed with the story teller."
4,Pocket Booklet - Constitution & Bill of Rights,The booklet was received in new condition at the appointed time. A very good pocket review source and that's the reason I bought it.
3,good starter guitar,"I overpaid for this from a different place (oops). I have issues keeping it in tune, and no matter what I do, the high end of the 1st string is always flat, and gets flatter the higher I go, to the point where I bend the string a 1/2 step out of habit up there to keep it in tune. of course, beginners probably don't play up there much. this could probably be fixed, but for the money, not sure it's worth it.on the plus side, the pickups are amazing. I get great low-end sound from the neck, perfect for metal, and decent bridge response for treble, though not as bright as a strat (obviously).It does have the infamous wiring bug -- when the 3way is in the middle, rolling back either pickup down to 0 cuts them both off completely. so fyi.. but easy to fix with a soldering iron if you're so inclined.after a year on this, I'm looking to upgrade, or maybe just swap out the neck.."
2,"Love the song, where are the remixes?","I bought this CD hoping that it would have the remixes. It does not... it has the radio version, an instrumental version, and 5 ~1 min. snippets of other songs that are on So Blu."
5,THis is a great CD!,"I think that Blu Cantrell;Hit 'em up style is a great cd. I love the Hit 'em up style song, and once you get the CD, you find other songs you like, too. There is no bad language in it. I really like this CD, and even my mom likes some songs!"
5,Newly remastered version of the original anthology.,"Well, we all know what a great collection this is from the father of Euro Disco, the big difference here over the 1999 release is the remastering, plain and simple - improved sound and artwork make this edition the one to have."
3,Title track,"It's an interesting piece of music, but either the .mp3 compression really mashed it flat or the original recording's quality itself needed work. It sounds compressed and muddy, and glaring, by turns; too much like something composed on a low quality midi synth. I know this is ambient electronica, and audiophile quality isn't what most people look for in this music, but on a good stereo, the thin, ""fake"" quality of the sound distracts, and that's not what you want with an ambient piece. The music deserved better.I wonder what it would sound like with a real orchestra/piano/percussion section."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT OR ANYTHING ELES FROM THIS COMPANY,I bought this item about 2 weeks ago looked good in the package ant seemed to be in working order once it was installed by a ase certified mechanic my a/c system was charged up but wouldn't the part was sticking so now i have to buy a replacement which isnt a big deal but i must have the system evacuated and the part is located behind the dash board so it is going to cost me 250 once again so to save 30 dollars it cost me 250 when i spoke with amazon they said tough cookie but we can give you a 10 dollar credit do not buy ant part for your car for ant internet site just get it locally so it doesn't cost you twice as much [...]
4,Great notebook,Great notebook for the price. They have 100 sheets and are hard bound. A handy notebook for taking notes or as a lab notebook.
1,Quality Control Lacking,Purchased 11 of these notebooks and of course 5 of them were missing pages ... some up to 12 pages missing... of course we did not find this out until we started using them so there goes our refund... Mead do you not have a quality control center? I do not expect to have to count the pages of the books before I give them out to students.. this creates such an inconvenience.
4,It's a Composition Book,Over the years I ordered a few of these Mead Black Marble Wide-Ruled Composition Books and they are all of good quality. Not much to more to say about them. I mostly use them as a journal and keep household information in them that I need to keep for future use. I am also a Ham Radio operator and I use one to keep frequencies and repeater info and the other I use as a logbook for the traffic nets I run. These are good for what I use them for. Yes. I would suggest to others to get these if they are looking for something like them.
5,Ready for school!,"I have 5 kids and my 10 year old is going into 4th grade.I like this a lot it has space to right and it has a place to put your name.Buy this becuase I went to Walmart target and were all sold out,so but today before its to light"
5,Very good!,"It is a pretty standard notebook at a very low price. If you need a notebook, you don't need anything more expensive than this!"
2,Flawed,"Like most flawed thinking in contemporary discourse, Friedman's reasoning works backward from the conclusions he wants to be true, back-filling with carefully selected--and shamelessly redacted--historical information. But sometimes there are facts that are facts, global warming be one, private sector malfeasance being another, and we just might be better off when we stop trying to construct a cartoon world out of things we want to be true. Note the year of this book's publication, then note the economic events that followed."
4,Its an adequate MP3 Player.,"I needed an MP3 player to take to the gym, and to just listen to around the house. I didnt want a super expensive one because I tend to beat up my electronics especially if I am wearing them! I purchased the SanDisk Sansa c250 because it looked like it was easy to use, had a big enough display and it was a good price. I have been really satisfied with it so far and I have had it for almost two years now. I love the display on it, its bright enough and easy to read what ever song/artist is playing. It clearly tells you how much battery life is left, and when you do have to charge it, it doesnt take long at all.My only complaint is that the way the menus are set up is a bit confusing, and for some reason no matter what song I left off on it always starts up playing the same song! I dont know how to fix that!I have replaced the headphones that came with it a couple of times, those never last as long as I want them too!"
1,No MSC mode,"The only reason I bought this device is that it claimed it has ""MSC"" mode. Apparently there is a version 2 of the device that has only MTP mode. The point of this limitation is lost on me and it is very disappointing (in this instance specifically, and more generally, for the future of mankind). If I want to treat it as a drive (right click on a file - send to), why not?"
1,Horribly Disappointed,"I bought this specifically because I had the M240 and I had been so pleased with that.This MP3 player has never worked correctly. It freezes up on daily basis, often takes 5-10 tries (and 15-20 minutes) to actually get it to turn on AND play music and is generally a huge hassle. I've updated the firmware, bought a new battery, contacted Sansa multiple times (and got NO response) and the thing still doesn't work correctly.The sound is good once it ever turns on and plays, but that's about all I have to say for it. I understand that other people are happy with it and suspect mine is a lemon, but the lack of response from Sansa has made me cautious about trying another one of their products, to say the least."
2,OK player if you dont use the extended MicroSD,"The player works fine, but the mp3 materials I loaded on the two MicroSD could not be read or played."
4,great mp3 player,great product for the price. screen is a little fuzzy when you upload pictures but the sounds quality is great!!!!!!
1,Doesn't play from where you stopped,"I wanted to listen to protected audio books on it and after listening for 30 minutes if you pause and the player goes to sleep, it starts the track from the very beginning and not from where you left off. This is very frustrating :( I checked it with mp3s and it's the same case, goes back to beginning of the track on restart (or wake from sleep). I wonder if all mp3 players other than iPods do that. Comments anyone?"
2,Good but only for awhile,"Overall it is a nice mp3 player, however, it only lasted 6 months. I lost sound from one of the headphones, and then no sound at all. I read that lots of people are having problems with the headphone jack, so I opened the thing up and there it was, the jack had detached. I tried soldering but it didn't work. I guess I'll just use it as a voice recorder."
2,it's ok but I don't recommend,"Two things I don't like about this player:- contrast is very bad, couldn't tell what line is selected.- Couldn't get the playlist work.The plus side is fm radio and recorder but if you don't need them then get a Sansa Clip instead."
2,Very poor software - skip this one!,"This MP3 player has pretty poor software. For the life of me, I couldn't get it to play tracks in the order that they appear on the album. With my MP3 collection, you could sort by file name, ID3 tag, or even date created and you'd end up with the proper order. But this unit played them alphabetically!Text contrast on the screen is awful."
3,Worked for 6 months!,Well I liked this product alot when I first bought it. It is simple to download music onto it. I am thankful that I bought the extended service plan on it because now it is not working. It keeps erasing all the memory cards out and it's own memory. I will download and a half an hour later it is gone. Now I have to send it in and wait for the company to send me a voucher to go get another one. I may not buy this same one now.
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH VISTA,"I've been trying to get my computer to recgonize the sansa for 3 days. I've consulted with forums and written emails to support. They basically say ""yeah there is an issue with it connecting to Vista"" Vista cannot find a driver and sandisk does not supply one or have one online. So as the title says ""DOES NOT WORK WITH VISTA"". I now have a useless piece of electronics sitting on my desk.Do not buy cause your gonna wish you hadn't."
3,Confused as heck,"I'm writing a pre-purchase review. I have no idea whether to purchase this item or not because the dimensions CAN'T be accurate! How can the product weigh a whole pound more than it's own shipping weight?? And who'd want to carry a 2 POUND MP3 player? Why does the product dimensions say the thing is 9 inches long? That can't be accurate when everyone else is saying it's so small...well, how small??Someone help me out here!Concerned MP3er"
4,Great little player,"I bought this with my 8 year old daughter who wanted to spend her Christmas money on a player. She couldn't afford an i-pod, and this was a great solution. Easy for her to use, includes a decent FM radio, and a voice recorder so she can record herself. I was able to get her going and transferred her small CD collection quickly and easily. The screen is a tad small, so I might not use this for a photo album, but so is the nano's screen. I own an i-pod nano and had I known, I would have bought this just for the radio if nothing else. I haven't downloaded with Rhapsody or Napster yet, so I can't comment on that aspect yet. It will be interesting to see the differences between i-tunes and these. Bottom line: Consider this player for kids or yourself. A very good value."
1,c250 SanDisk,This MP3 player froze up the second time I used it and would not come back on. would not recommend purchasing this product.
1,Is NOT supported on Vista,"Note that Sansa provides no support for this player on Vista, even though (as I write this in March) Vista has been available to customers for 5 months.You will not be able to update the device's firmware (which is several versions behind as shipped), and Sansa provides no guidance as to when they might (if ever) they will support Vista.(And they wonder can't compete with the iPod?)"
1,Don't buy if you have Windows Vista!!!,This product is not compatible with Windows Vista. This was a Christmas gift that will be going back.
1,Upset buyer,I bought this product and wanted to return it but can't. This product does not looked like it would be comfortable for either person. The band is big and a very thick rubber. And the tongue piece is also thick and sticks out quite a bit. Once you put the bullet In you better have a bigger fellow. There's a lot of rubber and objects between you. It's much much much bigger then appears in picture.
3,Thank You for Being a Friend,"I purchased this CD to complete my Super Hits collection. I now have all of the CD's. Not a lot on here I like, but ""Thank You for Being a Friend"" is worth the purchase. Andrew Gold didn't offer a lot, but this song always results in good thoughts and memories."
5,Wii G Case works great and protects your console,"I purchased this last year for not only the Wii, but similar for PS2, Xbox 360 and PS3, as i wanted to protect my kids investments. The do the job and are solid."
3,Lots of bugs. Great when it works.,"The machine itself is great, but the software required to use it is horrendously buggy. It crashes about once per three tapes. Sometimes it corrupts the first 5 seconds of sound in every song. Sometimes it crashes at the end of a tape, sometimes at the beginning. It's the buggiest piece of software I have used in years. That's a shame, because minus the bugs, it'd be a marvelous product. When it works, it works great."
1,HORRIBLE!,"I purchased Plusdeck2 in hopes of converting some of my old cassette tapes into an MP3 format and have had nothing but trouble. It started with the software - I loaded it on and it did NOTHING. It did not function at all, the buttons were not active (they were useless/dead), as though just a useless box on my screen with non-functioning buttons. Since the hardware would play my cassette tapes, I downloaded the Audacity recording software for free. That seemed to work and I was able to record 3 songs, then the Plusdeck2 Hardware just quit working altogether. Now it won't even play my cassette tapes anymore. I have e-mailed the company and have not heard back. Apparently, they are in Korea and there is no contact phone number - only the e-mail address - so there is NO support there what-so-ever. I feel like I have been duped. I would NOT purchase this again, please save yourself and purchase something else. Good luck!"
1,Good luck getting any support,"This product is trash, and there is zero customer support from the manufacturer. They have an e-mail address listed on their website, but I've e-mailed three times now and received no response at all. The device stopped working shortly after I purchased it, and although the manual says there's a warranty, that doesn't do much good if the company won't return your e-mails. Look for something with a more reputable company, because this one sure isn't."
5,great for converting,I bought one of these many years ago when they first came out. I have put the same one in two computers and have never had any problems. I am the type that hates opening the back of his computer for fear of damaging it but I felt the instructions were good. I have converted most of my tapes now. I did buy an ION cassette to tape converter when I got my second computer...again because I hate to open up the case(not a tech geek). That is sitting in the attic. I like that this one can detect tracks automatically. Maybe I didn't have the right software for the ION or I didn't understand how to use it but when I used it I had to stop at every track. Again maybe because I am old and not technically inclined but the plusdeck I felt was far superior and the sound quality excellent.
1,Problem with this t-shirt.,"Ok , i just read another review of this product and i couldn't believe it,because i have the same problem with this shirt.Only the holes !(not hole) is in the back. The shirt was dirty and the stamp have problems too.I'm very sad because i pay a lot of money for this product.BEWARE if you like to buy it."
5,A great way to get to know Tom Glavine and the Braves.,This book is a must have for any Braves fan. It is the story of a dream and the realization of that dream by one of today's greatest pitchers. In it Tom shares his thoughts on bringing a World Series Championship to Atlanta. Something that the fans of the Braves have wanted for decades. And no one tells it better than the 1995 World Series MVP.
5,"Tom Glavine, one of the best pitchers of all time","This book got to me really quickly with very fast shipping. The cover looks great and I did not spot any stains or hilights on inside. I have not begun reading yet, but am excited to do so soon."
5,Splendid,Fantastic CD/Video combo of Soulwax live. The live DVD waas filmed during a world tour and provides you with the full caleodoscopic effect of seeing them live. They offer a great combination of electronic music with a rock feel that is quite unique.
3,CREEPY yet CHEESY!,The best way to rate this movie is this.its a low budget film.parts of it creeped me out.parts of it was cheesy.all around strange movie
1,HORRIBLE,I'm a various writer but even this I could not write; this was just plain sick. The only good part to this movie was watching the a$$hole get his. I would not recommend this movie unless you are a demented freak; you will not like it.
4,"sick, twisted, original, enjoyable","Sick, twisted, original, enjoyable. If you've seen his films before.... you know what to expect here. Expect a truly sick, dysfunctional family, great acting, great story."
3,Made in China. Pretty small. Not your average toy size.,"I bought the Kyjen Pig and Duck, and all I can say is wow... Are they small or what! This isn't Amazon's or Kyjen's error. In fact, it is mine. I should have read the description. I purchased this for around $6.00 through Amazon (give or take a few pennies). For a toy this small, it is borderline expensive... Especially considering the fact that it IS made in China. The pig has a sound box inside it, which does deliver noise to entice a dog's curiosity. I don't think this will stand the test of time though, even if you're like me and you supervise all toy play time with your dog."
1,Way TOOO tiny,I just got the one that is suppose to be 7x4x2 and it is more like 4x3x2 it is tiny. I am returning it as if you have a toy dog it may be the right size but my bully would choke on it.
4,"Cute toy, but arrived very dirty","Toy works fine, but arrived looking like it had been drug across a dusty warehouse floor. Squeaker works, but overall construction wouldn't hold up to a dog that tears things up."
4,Great for children!,I thought this cd was very good considering what the Monkees were about back in the day. The songs are great for children to listen to and just have fun.
1,EWWWWW!,This is the worst CD that the Monkees ever had. I hope this doensnt give people the wrong impression of what the Monkees were really about!
2,Not very helpful or unique,I simply did not feel that this book was very helpful or unique. I would not recommend it.
4,Interesting documentary,"This was a very interesting documentary. It pointed out the ridiculousness of American's fascination with celebrities. It was also interesting to see the development of the main character since he had such an interesting career choice at such a young age. The movie lets the viewer decide how they feel about the paparazzi at the end of the movie. Overall, I would recommend this movie!"
1,ABSOLUTLY SUCKS!!,"I love the Scorpions. They are my favorite band. I own all of there cd's, dvd's and even cassette tapes. But this SUCKS. The concert footage is terrible. When the Scorps are talking in english there is some DOUCHE bag translating everything into German so you can't here anything they say. Why do they say english format when all I here is german translaters. And no I checked you can not turn that off. Unless you understand German this is a waste of money and time. The fact that this is unauthorized should had tipped me off that it was an inferior product. The Scorpions would had never let something so awful be released with there name on it."
5,A HEARTWARMING INSPIRATION!!!,"I read Shaman many years ago, and occasionally still think of this book. While it is a sequel to THE PHYSICIAN, in that it continues the saga of the Cole family, it stands on its own. I have loaned it out many times, and it remains a keeper on my shelves, which my family and I will read again and again!!!"
1,Aaaaargh!,"I was so happy when I had read The Physician. It was such a good book I read it in 2 days flat, just like my father. So then I turn to The Shaman. And cant get past the first few pages. What On EARTH happened in the seven centuries in between these two novels? It was a terrible surprise. No wonder nobody reviewed this book until now. They dont want to waste their time. Mr. Gordon, you severely deluded me."
3,Belkin CAT5E Patch Cable,This is a lightweight cable for ethernet connectivity. It arrived within the time frame and worked connecting my laptop to my router while I was repairing the wireless drivers. The price was right.
3,"Cheap, works, is as described, but is not as shown","Cable is functional and very inexpensive, but it is not snagless as pictured. As noted in the reviews these are hand-crimped connectors and not as nice as the snagless factory-terminated variety. That said, while I have only used one of the two I purchased and have not had any signal quality issues with it.Bottom line: This is a very basic cable at a very low price -- just make sure this is what you want when you order."
1,Not the product that is pictured,This is not a booted cable as is pictured. This is just a cable with hand-crimped ends.
1,deceptive picture,"The picture shows molded connectors, but the actual cable has hand crimped connectors that are much less reliable. Since Amazon ships and sells this product, they should take responsibility for changing the picture to match the item."
1,Not as advertised; failed within a week,"As others have written, the cables are hand-terminated cables using Belkin cables, not Belkin factory-termnated cables. As such, the connections are weaker, and my cable failed after less than a week of light use - the jacket pulled out of the RJ45 connector, and some of the twisted pair connections have been intermittent since it arrived. I have to jiggle the cable just right for my computer to get a link.This was a waste of money. Pay a little more and get a cable that actually works."
1,Not as Advertised,"The picture CLEARLY shows a snagless cable, which this is most definitely not. Completely false advertising."
5,As great as any earlier work,"Take a deep breath Sasha fans, this album delivers in spades. It's different, but feels like a natural progression from 'Dagger and Involver. On the second disc, the sound does cut out on the first track, but this is intentional, short, and simply part of the music. Remember this is a live mix. Considering this, Sasha mixes seemlessly and the rare crowd noise is a nice reminder of Sasha's formidable talent.Avalon is more in your face than his earlier sound, it's music you can dance to and trip to. Disc 1 has a more tech house feel, trance fans should head straight to disc 2 for a fresh take on progessive house.Despite being 2 discs, the mix is a bit shorter than I would have liked. It's a fast, hard hitting listen that you will enjoy though. And like with Sasha's previous work, you stand a good chance of growing to love it."
3,love hawaiian style,"vraisemblance takes a beating when jake lassiter resorts to show tunes & psychological tap-dancing to stave off certain death at the hand of an uzi bearing reincarnated hawaiian god.not levine's best, though still entertaining. average."
3,Nuts,"I bought this cd for one song, which is somehow fitting for me - ""They're Coming to take me away"". The rest of the stuff is really out to lunch, no wonder the guy rapidly faded away into oblivion. Oh! Oh!, gotta go, here they come ( in their little hite coats, ha ha! )"
4,Devo rules!,"What a relief was the coming of Devo around 1978. It was the beginning ofa new kind of trend in pop music: the new wave era has begun. Of course,Devo was the leader of the pack. Matter of fact, they were ahead of theirtime. They made videos for their songs when MTV was not even born. A liveshow of Devo was an experience to remember! A quarter century has passed,and their big hits are still a pleasure to listen to. If you are an oldfan like me or a newbie who wants to discover Devo, buy this CD! Put iton and let it play! Pleasure guaranteed!"
4,This is the same CD,"I'll tell you something, I dont have this CD. I saw it at the store and it is the samething as the other greatest hits. It has free slipcase. Whoop-dee-do. It is a great CD though but they should have taken off Smart patrol/mr. dna and put the day my baby gave me a surprize instead. other wise ok. They also should of put on time out for fun. thats all."
5,Fabulous Book - A Bible for Mechanics,"I must disagree with what the other reviewers have said. This book is the best book I have ever come across for Mechanics. The approach is pictorial and problem-solving techniques are marvellously illustrated. There is an enormous amount of well-graded problems, so if you cant solve one problem on your own then you have many more to try. A Bible for Mechanics."
5,THE BEST BOOK EVER IN ENGINEERING MECHANICS,"Well, I'm not new to those authers. All their books represent one of the best in field, and their mechanics book is one of them. The text is well-organized, the material is presented professionaly, the problems help to understand and grasp the subject that you feel quite confident in your ability. A smart textbook. No one can recognize what he/she misses in engineering mechanics untill he/she has the opportunity to study this book."
5,Charging The DS,"I definitely know that when it comes to handheld game systems, Nintendo has remained the king for nearly 25 years. It started with the Nintendo Game & Watch handhelds, then moved on the success of the Game Boy and its variations, and now just a year and a half ago with the Nintendo DS. But, there are just no batteries involved with the system. All it actually takes is a simple AC adapter to charge a special battery designed for the DS. While you can get that with the Nintendo DS, it also is available to buy seperately as a backup. It is very useful if you buy the DS used, or if the adapter that comes with the DS isn't working properly, this is a great backup.A.C. Adapter: APrice: AOverall: A+"
1,AC Adapter,"I purchased the wrong adapter! It should had been for the DSi instead of the DS, so I have absolutely no idea how it works."
1,This is a warning!!!,"I ordered this charger for my game boy advance, and nintendo DS. By the way this is for the original DS only, not the DS lite or anything later. This is obviously advertised as a DS charger, with all the right descriptions, but when I received it in the mail I was very very disappointed. What I got was a crappy little white box with nothing even close to a DS charger inside. What was actually in the box was a random computer chip that looked like it wouldn't be of any use to any kind of device. With the low price I didn't even bother returning it, so USMARTStore got like five bucks for no reason. For anyone looking to buy this, or anything from USMARTStore, listen to my advice and don't even try, you are taking your chances."
1,Wrong!!!!,Purchased only to find out it don't fit the Nintendo DS! What a waste of money and really irritated in the description it said it fits the Nintendo DS!
5,Charger for the Original Nintendo DS,"It's a charger for the original Nintendo DS (Chargers are different between the first DS and the DS Lite, 3DS etc.).The product works as expected; it charges the DS! It's not ""Nintendo"" brand, but I don't notice a bit ofdifference between this and my old one. I recommend because it's cheap and it WORKS."
2,Duck Dead in Twenty Seconds,"Scottie's attention was fully focused on this toy as I unwrapped it. I took it outside where husband was sitting and said, ""I give it less than 20 seconds"", then tossed it over to Scottie. Within the allotted timeframe, the duck's hard quacking mechanism was broken and duck's tail was next on his list. Like another reviewer, it was fun to watch the sheer 20 seconds of joy but the toy does not stand up to my dog. As a caution, the toy is much smaller than I expected and could be swallowed and cause a choking hazard for any but the smallest of dogs.I've purchased other toys by this manufacturer and they have been winners. Unfortunately, this toy would do best with a small, gentle dog rather than a rough-and-tumble Scottish Terrier!"
5,Dog Favorite,My dogs just love these little talking toys I like that the talking part comes out so the toy can be washed and treats put in its place. I sometimes move the voices around so the bear quacks and the duck roars just for fun
3,"Great topic, but fairly academic","Book compiled from numerous interviews as opposed to real practitioners. I've worked with product lines and was quite excited when this book was published. However, I was rather disappointed. It doesn't really provide the insight into how do I sit down and create a product line.The first chapter is a great introduction to product lines. The next couple of chapters are okay, but rather fluffy. The rest of the book is really academic and formal and I didn't find it particularly useful. These chapters were also very difficult to read (tedious and dry). Too much pontification; too little real information."
3,Puppets in Germany,This very well may be the best Puppet Master of the series. It is kinda prequel to the first 2. Toulon (the puppet master) is played by the same old dude that's in the movie Dolls and he is great as the puppet master. Get to see Puppets kill horrible evil nazi's plus the birth of one of my favorite puppets Ms.Leech.
4,Needs Closed Captioning!,"My family and I love the Poirot series with David Suchet. The A&E movie series have closed captioning (most of them, anyway), the Acorn series do not. My wife is about 98% deaf, and I sometimes have a hard time understanding the words because of the accents and/or background noise in the show. Closed captioning is a must with today's technology. My wife could certainly enjoy the movies much more if there was CC. Other than that, the David Suchet version of Poirot is superb!"
1,Only if you're a professional dancer,"I tried. I really did. But I just could not 'get' the moves in this workout. I'm about as uncoordinated as they come, so I'm sure some of it is me; however, I found that I simply could not contort myself into the positions necessary. Cross this foot over that foot, then kick yourself in the rear. No thanks. I nearly fell over several times just trying."
1,Clasp failed,The bag was used three times within two weeks. On the fourth use one of the twist clasps broke off. I haven't bothered to send it back as the shipping cost would be half the cost of the bag itself. I'm not sure what I'm going to try now. I'm a bit gun shy.
4,canvas bag,"Nice bag- a little more vivid yellow than shown in the photo, but plenty of room for notebooks for school, rp games, to use as a purse, or, like I did, fill with dvds as a Christmas present. The closures are a little fragile -- you'll want to inspect them closely to make sure they didn't snap off during shipping -- but the adjustable strap isn't too wide to be uncomfortable, and it seems durable enough to take normal abuse for at least a few years. good bag. good buy. lotsa colors!"
1,poor writing and slanderous,"the writer, a Harvard Professor, displays an accute amateurish tone throughout the book. Unsuccessfully tries to diminish Luther's accomplishments and genius with improbable assumptions and irrelevant speculation. It's a weak biography and flawed historical account. If the poor quality of this book is indicative of the intellectual level at Harvard, I would say that they have serious problems. In fact, what is their great reputation all about?"
3,Interesting but flawed bio.,"I consider myself a secular humanist, so while some of the most interesting figures in history are religious , I am always apprehensive reading about them because I fear a story told with a religious bent. Here, however, there is too much of a good thing. The author uses Luther's story to continually make examples and preach his personal atheistic philosophy. At first it becomes distracting but eventually it becomes repetitious and then, finally, plain annoying and out of place. This biography had great potential, because after the intial point had been made, if an editor would have cut the repetition, the biography would have been first rate. One can get a sense of the horror of living during the plague and the psychological effects that had on individuals, and how that may have helped shape Luther's neurosis and theology. It is a shame that so much of this book was so heavy handed."
1,A 'How To' book that fails to explain 'How To'.,"I would expect a book titled ""Sushi: Making at Home"" to explain sushi making at home, wrong. The biography of the author on the inside jacket immediately concerned me. Her credentials are as follows; graduation from Junior College (nothing about degree), worked as a hospital nutritionalist (without offending hospital nutritionalists/dietitions this is a position that does not necessarily suggest inherent expert knowledge of the subject), and wrote other books of questionalble subject knowledge titled ""Hamburgers"" and ""Healthy drinks"". The book does not cover the obvious concentration areas of preparing/presenting raw seafood nor what to look for in quality sushi ingrediants. I hope this review spurs individuals interested in a book of this topic to look for a practical guide."
2,Not what it claimed,Paint did not meet the claims that it could be used on wood stoves. I turned burnt brown after a week.
3,Good Memories,"OK, so these are relatively new songs, but after having spent a summer in Spain, they bring back wonderful memories for me. This CD contains ALL the most popular songs in Spain today that are playing in all the best Discotecas. If you like dance music or have been to Spain recently, this CD is for you. However, the music isn't exactly the most profound or amazing. Enjoyable."
3,old fashioned children's book,"This is a very thick book, full of old fashioned children's tales. It's not for reading chronologically, but rather dipping into. it's a bit of an odd duck book, in that it is too hard for a small child to read for themselves, and too simple for an older child to want to read. I think it's a nice book to pull out from time to time to read with your little one, a small section at a time, (maybe a book at Grandmas, where they get to read it a story a visit) It's not a child friendly format as it is quite thick and small, so not easy for small fingers. Has a slightly Victorian feel in it's topics and design. I liked it but don't know how much use it will actually get. Still, it's nice to see those familiar nursery rhymes and the drawings can be quite sweet."
5,Awesome Find,"Searching for obscure rock in the era I was born into, I stumbled across this gem of a band. CACTUS were an original, tight, hard rockin' juggernaut of a group who were on par with the rest of the 70's rock pantheon (ie Zeppelin and Skynard). In fact, their sound is akin to both those groups. Why they faded into obscurity is beyond me because every tune is a flawless heavy rock song. It's a shame really but to me this greatest hits collection is a time capsule, an archeological relic from the 70'S. ""Rock-n-Roll Children"" is an anthem if there ever was one, and should be a standard on classic rock radio and ""Rumblin' Man"" is a dense, killer track, evoking MC5's level of chaos and power. I like to think that when I was born these guys were rockin' out somewhere out there. It'd be a shame if they went unheard. Awesome road trip music, by the way."
4,"Love the cane, color off",I have a similar cane and wanted a different color. The copper is not what I expected. It seemed more brown than copper. As a cane it works fine and I would recommend the cane to anyone.
3,Loose and wobbly,"I was happy with this cane, at first. However, after several foldings the joints became loose. This happened with one other folding cane I bought and I now suspect this is an inherent problem with folding canes. However, I was able to correct the looseness by some judicious placing of adhesive tape and never folded the cane again. Even so eventually the joints became loose and the cane started to become bowed."
4,Let's Have a Seder,"I found Meredith Gould's book to be extremely helpful in planning our Seder this year. Last year we used a ""Christian"" version of the traditional Seder Supper but it really did not bring Jesus, Our Lord into the celebration. Ms. Gould's book really takes the Catholic perspective of this Jewish Tradition and blends it beautifully, using the Gospels as a basis. I am really looking forward to celebrating it with the Passion and Resurection in mind. I highly recommend it."
2,Nice Try,"I bought this book, hoping to find in it a seder that incorporated the rich traditions of both Judaism and Catholicism. I unfortunately did not find what I had hoped. The seder and explanations contained herein seemed to in many cases diminish the significance of the Jewish celebration of Passover and not sufficiently detail the continuity of the last seder of Jesus with the celebration of the Mass and Catholicism and its development. I would not recommend this book to anyone who did not have a thorough familiarity with and appreciation for the Jewish traditions. My husband, who is Jewish, and I (Catholic) ended up writing our own seder for my parish seder. The thirst from the group we celebrated with was for authentic Judaism in the context of Catholicism. Despite my high hopes, I did not find this in this book and could not in good conscience recommend its use."
3,Not the item pictured,These are not the item pictured. They are loose in a bag. But they are the hard to find stylus for Nintendo DS. Which are needed to play your DS.
5,Lem-ish mystery story,"I happened to read this book after Stanislav Lem's 'His Masters voice' In my view, these books complement each other well, when Lem is more society-oriented, this book is something similar in a more personal way. I recommend reading this book first. Great reading if one wants to have a break amidst science studies. The tone of the book is somewhat humorous ('Who are all these people barging in...?') but more serious tones can also be heard. I'm amazed by how many layers Strugatsky has been able to put in this one. One could almost imagine this to be a true story about some Soviet scientists, though it's titled under SF. Great book."
1,Dont buy it...,"Hello, this kind of batteries are amazing and all others from sony, don't you dare to buy this specific one, because I have alredy ordered because I wanted the slide case for some others rechargable ones I have, ande they send me the exactly same batteries, but without the slide case, There is a mismatch in the picture and the name, that's what they told me when I claimed, and amazon suggest me to return the item (wich I did), but they did not fix it at the web site... So if you are looking for the batteries its OK, buy it, but if you want to have also the slide case, don't buy it because they wont send it."
3,Too Short And Not Enough Info,I wish they would not have edited as much of the information shared during his seminar and felt the DVD was too short. His voice sounded like he needed some rest as well. I felt that I recieved half of what I was expecting.
1,Not what it appears,"This looked like a killer compilation of 80's metal songs, however upon getting it home and giving it a listen you can clearly tell these are NOT the origional recordings of the songs. They are shoddy half-ass remakes. Most are still by the origional band but you can tell they are re-recordings that have none of the energy of the origional recordings.Save your money, even free is too much to pay for this load of junk."
4,=),"I new ahead of time that this was a used cd set, and the slipcover and case w/ 3 cds were pretty rough looking. The cds were in great condition (music sound sucked!lol!)"
1,Terrible and false advertising,"I bought this from my phone, didn't say anywhere that these weren't the original tracks. Total ripoff, I'd like my money back!"
2,Buy another Vehicle Navigation System,"On the positive side the unit works fairly well for navigation in most situations and on occasion has proved to be a big help in routing around traffic jams.On the negative side, the FM transmitter is terrible. There is an audio output if your car has a direct audio input line in. I do not use the XM feature anymore due to the sound quality and less than adequate reception when in the vicinity of trees. The unit has become intermittent on speech and the speak button has never worked properly. Sometimes the routing selects a much longer route when a shorter route is available. I wish there were more options for setup to let you customize the function of the unit better.Danger: Before you buy a Garmin product, send an email to the tech support line. You get an automated note back saying it will take 5-7 DAYS to get a response. That is beyond unacceptable customer service! Calling the 800 number produced repeated busy signals.There are better options available."
3,Garmin 2730 works as good as cell phones used to.,"As far as city driving, it sucks. I travel for a living and every time I reach NYC, Philly or any big city, I get no GPS. All of them do that. Reminds me of cell phones when they first came out. The power cord on the back also snaps out at times. Its a pain in the a**. Also if you move it from car to car, sometimes it won't work right away. I had to plug it in to the lighter several times to get it to work on this last trip. Otherwise it is a good product. I suggest taking a map with you anyway for city driving. The XM is ok. Cds are louder, the sound is muffled and sometimes you have to switch radio stations to get decent sound."
2,returned unopened,"Ordered this GPS, continued reading reviews, returned it unopened due to reports that the power cable came unplugged easily. Since there is no onboard battery, destination & satelite signal would need to be re-entered each time. Ordered the Nuvi 350 & love it!"
3,a little disappointed,"I was excited when I heard this book was out. I liked ""Just in Time"", loved ""Just Perfect"" and hoped this book would be just as good. Unfortunately, the book was just mediocre and I ended up donating my copy to my local library.I found the second book very funny and sweet, and I was hoping for more of the same. My main issue with the book is that I couldn't get to like the heroine; I found her cold. (Of course, she did want to kill someone.) There also weren't as many funny moments as there were in the second book.If you're hooked on the series like I was, this book is worth reading so you can see how things turn out for Berinwick, but don't expect it to be as good as the others."
2,Disappointing.,"I am halfway through a book that sounded delightful and am fighting to finish it. This is my first Lansdowne book and her writing,frankly, is stilted. Guess I don't like her style much. Far from fast paced, I think it is slow and tedious. It is good to see this ""feared"" hero show his vulnerability piece by piece.Julia is a tough cookie and Emmy is a peagooose. The dialogue gets confusing since they are often talking to themselves and you have to figure out if its a one way or 2 way conversation.I'll finish it for the ""duke"" but no more Lansdowne books for me."
4,A Nerds Dream.,"If Nerds dream of cat eared girls that made most woman look small if you know what I'm saying. This is just a funny series & nothing real the realy jumps out at you it just good old fashion fan service, but must say the shoots they make at sci-fi make's me laught each time I watch it. It is a series that if worth seeing at lest once or made more times."
5,Awesome,I had to do this book for a report which are usually boring but this book made me think but at the same time have fun!
1,Beware yellowing paper,"Like too many conglomerates, Mead is cutting corners and it shows. These Five Star spiral notebooks seem rugged enough with their polyethylene covers, but my experience is that within a year or so the paper begins to seriously yellow from the outer edges--far faster than older Mead notebooks I have. This suggests the nifty cover are matched with cheap, acidy paper. Okay if you never plan to look at those college notes once you finish the course, but if plan on making long-term use of the contents of your spiral notebooks, look elsewhere."
1,very poor,very disapointed with this notebook. the paper is very poor quality not very bright and looks dingy. also some pages are wrinkled. i wont be buying a mead product again.
3,Pretty good.,"I am in love with tropical marine life, but this is the first book about reef ecology I've read so I'm not exactly sure how to judge it. I've read the whole book, cover to cover, in about two weeks for offhand studies, maybe 10-15 pages a day, on average, all week. The first part of the book is a little interesting, talking about the structure of jellyfish, or more correctly 'sea jellies', but not much for me to give the book rapt attention. Some parts are just plain boring to be honest.The pictures are good, but not a lot of text, most of the time just a third or a half of the page is text.I think the most interesting part is the last half where it talks about coral reef predators and the impact of human life on the Hawaiian reefs. It's not exactly a book that you can't put down, but it has some fascinating information that I think any marine life lover should know, so all in all I think it's a pretty good book."
2,Not a good buy,"I don't think this book is quite as bad as the one star the first reviewer gave it, but the second reviewer must be kidding. Five stars?! Terrific graphic design?! Fun to read?! I give it two stars, and that's being on the generous side. I would not recommend it."
5,I love this book,Read it and keep it on your night table to read before going to sleep. It's wonderful.
4,Music for good times and bad times,"Great album, 10 out of the 12 tracks have the ""mellow-melodic"" flow that I was looking for. The music on this album will keep you calm and collected when you get angry or when somebody breaks your heart, or you can throw it on when you want to hear something that goes down smooth.FYI, my music preferences are hip-hop, jazz, R&B; and MORCHEEBA, ya dig???Cheers"
2,Empty Calories,"I know we should try to rate CDs on their own worth, but it's hard with this one. Morcheeba's first two CDs, Big Calm and Who Can You Trust?, are really good, with Big Calm being a high water mark. It's a true classic: no dead spots. Charango? Not so good. When the only song that sticks with me after listening to this CD is the novelty tune ""Women Lose Weight,"" I feel that my Morcheeba fix is better supplied elsewhere."
1,a compromise and nothing more,"Rather than stick to their guns and carry on with the progression first started with Fragments of Freedom, Morcheeba have instead ducked out, and given the public what they want: a tired and out of date re-tread of the sound that first gave them some exposure. This makes me believe that Morcheeba are nothing more than money grabbing capitalists - not the genuine creative force we so often hear them to be from their overblown press releases. Filling up the CD with 'big name' guests is merely a crafty act to distract from the fact that, boiled down, we've heard all this stuff before - back when it seemed fresh and exciting. That is no longer the case, Morcheeba know it, and before you go dishing out hard cash for this CD, you need to know it too. Stick to the first two CDs - both essential - everything else just points down. It was fun while it lasted."
4,Really do like this thing,"I am pleased with the functions and general features of the PVR. The one thing that bugs me is the PVR ERROR message that has replaced the menu icons. This is the second PVR I have owned with this same anomaly. The first, I returned within warranty to Amazon and they replaced it. Yeah Amazon! This one I have now is past the warranty period. All the functions of the player still work; just have to remember what icon used to be where."
5,it is awesome!!,"I ordered this for my daughter and ended up returning it because it was a little too complicated for my 11 year old. i did try it out before sending it back. i recorded from my dish dvr right to the device and it was perfect. i would recommend this product to anyone who needs to take tv with them, like on lunch breaks, trips, etc. how much it holds depends on the size of the memory card you put in it. i read though the reviews and go alot of info from people who are already using it. so read the rest of the reviews, they are very helpful. thats how i learned how to hook it up to my dish dvr."
3,nice price but a name on it?,it got here a few days late and also had a persons name on the disc and the book it came with
5,Nice for college,Since I am doing 5 subjects per semester this was a great find. Plus it has compartments for each subject area to hold important papers.
2,I chose a black color and they gave me pink !!,"I bought this item twice, and they didn't ship the color I chose in both items. Other than that, this notebook is awesome."
4,Terrific TV show,"This is a great show to watch if you want to remember the 1970s and 1980s. The clothes, the music, the hair it has it all. Plus, you get to see the who's who of the 1980s and its fun seeing old faces. Great buy for all you '80s TV fans."
3,These games are alright,"This is a fairly basic collection of card games. I don't know why the other reviewer thought it was so bad. I like playing Rummy, Whist, Euchre and Canasta and these versions are decent."
4,This book is -very- informative but watch where you read.,"This book has details and statistics on everything from characters to probably every item in the game. Don't read it until you've cleared a dungeon then read that section to see if you missed something. The character creation tips are already mentioned in the start of the game but they're are a few details that come in handy. Not enough talk about dexterity bonuses in melee combat, their are some you know. Some class kits were ""knocked"" but you should make your own desision. The love interests should have been left out of the manual as it is much sweeter to be surprised by that element of the plot."
3,Very unprofessional,"Versus books made some of the best strategy guides I've seen. They were colorful, helpful, and concise. However, this pile of schlock is inexcusable. I payed $17, and it felt like I was reading one of my 8 year old brother's book reports (typos included). TONS of rancid information, lack of adequate coverage, and misprints. Save your money and find an online walkthrough.Verdict: Far from a ""perfect guide""."
2,Pre-pubescent teens should not be given the task of writing,"Buy this guide and you'll most likely come to the conclusion that Versus Books, in a desperate rush to create game guides, has found it necessary to seek out young, hormonally imbalanced teenagers to do their writing for them. Their incessant commentary the ""Hot babes"" of the game certainly brings the author's maturity level into question. Secondly, as has been stated before, this guide is a lazy man's compiliation of data and information, so don't expect to find the information that you are looking for in a crunch (Especially when you are trying to change Edwina back into a male. A certain girdle is necessary for this and the author tells the gamer that ""You don't really want this item, do you? We'll let you find this on your own). I certainly hope that Versus Books learns from this mistake. If they don't make any changes soon, I don't foresee them being in business much longer."
3,the worst of Versus,"The guide is helpful if your just trying to win the champianships and the odds of finding a pokemon. The guide however does not tell you much on any of the pokemon. It just tells you a little bit of some of the new pokemon. the are better guids that will tell you ech and every one of the pokemon in the game some were else on this site i just saw it a while ago. Over all it depends what you want form the guide: if you are into just the quest then i suggest this guide, but if ou want to learn more about pokemon find another guide."
4,I Loved It!,"I am a Phoenix, Arizona native and I Loved This Book! I bought 3 copies to share with family and friends for Christmas.Although I have lived in Phoenix and the White Mountains of Arizona all of my life and have known of the diverse Native American nations sharing our community, I had never heard the fascinating histories told with such depth and detail. I enjoyed the dual biography format of the book which allowed the reader to see General Crook and Geronimo side by side as men in opposing political environments.The descriptive, creative language Aleshire uses makes the scenes come to life as if I were there. His story makes the history of the White Mountains, Chirichauas, San Carlos areas rich, deep and vivid with history.Many thanks to Peter Aleshire from an Arizona native."
4,Instead of doing this...,"Why not just release ""Fink"" and ""Twists"" on CD (you can only find it around in vinyl at collectors prices), instead of this compilation that leaves us old fans disappointed?"
5,a valuable survey and resource book for Open Source .NET development tools,"Excerpt from C# Online.NET Review (wiki.CSharp-Online.NET):""This book is a general survey of Open Source tools for .NET development. While most of these tools are already familiar to active Open Source community members, the book concentrates the information into a single resource book....Although the scope of the book is quite broad, it does not attempt an exhaustive list of Open Source .NET projects. Instead, it focus on the most popular and productive tools available--most of which are free! NAnt, NDoc, and NUnit from the title are well covered."""
3,Good Value but WAY too Small!,I ordered this thinking I was going to make beautiful french bread loaves like you see in the store! I was wrong! It is only big enough to make breadsticks...and two at that! Don't waste your money if you have the same vison as I do. If you want breadsticks for the family you need to order 3 and use one typical batch of bread dough.
4,Will not fit my Mossberg 500,"Other reviews say they installed this stock on a Mossberg 500. It will NOT fit my Mossberg 500A. The stock is cut differently where it connects to the shotgun, No way this will fit my Mossberg. Love the stock but it wont fit my gun."
2,"Broke After 4, 3"" Rounds","This stock came on a Remington 870 tactical I bought new. Took the gun to the range to pattern it. After 4 rounds of 3"" 00, the lever that attaches to the spring in the pistol grip ended up in front of the sliding piece behind the receiver instead of in the pocketbehind the sliding piece where it belongs. This allowed the receiver to be driven back into the stock far enough that the safety was not visible. Called Blackhawk and there was no problem in getting a RMA to return the stock but the people I talked to would not discuss what caused the problem and if the problem had been corrected. Blackhawk paid for shipping the old and new stocks. I received the new stock 17 days after shipping the old one. Since I don't know if the problem has been fixed, I have not convinced myself that I am going to mount the new stock. This is a home defense weapon and I need something I can depend on."
3,"New Cover, Old Video","The cover of this DVD looks very sophisticated and new, yet the material inside is very old. I looked inside and the copyright date is 1991, which is exactly how it looks. Very deceiving.However, the stretches covered by Karen are very good, even though for more active people it may be boring (but stretching is not for entertainment or fun, it's to help your body out). After going through the session (I have not stretched before), my body had a welcome warm feeling and it was the best feeling I've felt in a while. It's what my body has been waiting for. So if you are a semi- or regular exerciser, you need a DVD such as this to show you the proper techniques for lengthening and stretching your muscles so you can perform better."
3,bowflex motivator 2,"good for the price i guess. manual of exercise routines has several excercises listed to do in weeks 4 to 6 but no instructions showing how to do those particular exercises. the leg extension on the unit i received was welded together crooked, though it doesn't effect the machine it is kind of irritating to look at this while you do your leg extensions having one leg going higher than the other. if i were into serious weight training i would skip this unit."
1,A waste of time!!!,"This book contains almost NO world information (and without world information, a book is purely worthless!), a few pages on mercs (which i could of pulled out of my arse myself and done a better job), painfully long descriptions of a buncha' mercenary groups (worthless, unless you enjoy reading character bios), and WAY too many weapons (we have enough guns already!) that are pretty darned overpowered, if i do say so myself! A munchkin's wet dream, and a GM's nightmare. DON'T BUY IT!"
1,Creates a Dust Cloud- Stinks,"I've used a famous corn-based litter for several years. Lately their price has gone up, & the quality has gone down. I read the reviews for this, & decided to try it. The first thing I noticed was a huge dust cloud after I poured the litter in the box. I'm not used to ANY litter dust, & have no desire to start now. I can imagine how the dust will coat anything nearby. The next issue WAS THE SMELL. After the litter had been used for only 2 days, the house smelled like a barn. This is just gross, & I don't understand all the good reviews."
4,Fun but maybe not for younger baby,"My 6-month-old really enjoys when I hold this and move it in front of him, and he'll grab the bottom ring and want to hold it. He's really interested in anything that makes noise right now (the wood hits together when you shake it around), but I think that he is still a bit small for this. He's hit himself in the head with it a few times, and it is a pretty substantial wooden toy. I'm also a bit worried because it does have small pieces. The elastic seems very strong, but if it were to ever snap then he could choke on the beads. Overall, I think that it is very cute and fun for him to play with when I am playing with him. For solo play, however, it's probably better for older babies. We also have the similar but smaller Haba squeak-squeak toy, and it is a better size for him to hold and play with."
5,Outstanding Text,This book is a comprehensive text that is both approachable and informative. Its critical thinking emphasis on cross-cultural psychology lends it added value. It's nice to come across a cross-cultural book that neither panders to a specific minority group nor neglects that vast diversity that psychology professionals will no doubt encounter. I recommend this text to anyone looking to go into a psychology or sociology related field.
3,message/correction,"Two of my reviews of this CD appeared on your site. I thought the first one didn't send correctly b/c of technical problem, so I wrote another and sent it. Please delete one of them if you wish. Thanks."
4,A little info on In Search of Vol. 1,"This video is from the 1970's series In Search Of with Leonard Nimoy. Vol. 1 contains the episodes dealing with: Sherlock Holmes, Jack the Ripper, and Tower of London Murders. Although somewhat dated I still find the series interesting and entertaining."
4,You can reclaim your life!,"After reading this book from cover to cover, I found it to be a great resource and guide to help in getting my priorities in order.I discovered that my priorities and values changed when I realized that time is a precious gift and more valuable than possessions. Vicki Norris gives you the chance to discover where your time and energy is wasted and the steps to remedy disorganization in your life.As Vicki says ""Not only will you learn organizing truths, principles, and strategies, you will learn how to become your own life manager."" And that life will be much more personally gratifying thanks to Vicki!"
4,A great reminder!,"People find such humor in my well-organized life. Simply, I work well in an orderly environment.I found Ms. Norris' book very insightful. Beyond my fine tuning the learned tasks of sorting, labeling, storing, and tidying, this book reminded me that organization is much more. Sure, the tasks are important and needed, but the objective is not to exclaim, ""I HAVE CLEANED MY ROOM!""As the book describes, organization enables me to identify and then focus on my priorities - the things the REALLY matter to ME. A great reminder!"
1,way too hard,I am in relatively good shape. I found this workout to be way too hard. I have tried to do this a few times and can just not keep up.
2,Ripped easily,Ripped quickly after use. Not sturdy enough for what it is intended: staying in a notebook and carrying pencils. Very flimsy and holes ripped after a few weeks so had to replace. Inconvenient.
3,Good for marketing materials,"Accepts fairly heavy paper (60-80# if I remember correctly) without significant jamming or print issues. With heavier papers (non Epson) we lose about 10% of prints to print smearing, etc.Not a perfect 'print and forget' product. Required a fair bit of experimenting to find the right marketing portfolio papers that would print well enough. No doubt Epson paper does better but we wanted to be able to use paper from our local print office (don't like having to buy reams of paper sight unseen online).All software works great. Wish HP could make network functions as well as Epson does.Would be nice to see this product to come down in price. We bought off Amazon for a significant discount 1 year ago. Epson should also make this an AIO for true flexibility."
1,What a joke!,"This guy is a complete joke this ""Original"" (who sounds like all those nasal-voiced-chalino wannabes) de la ""Sierra"" (who was actually born and raised in East L.A.) is. not only is he butchering classic songs, but also butchering the great music of Banda with rap? WTF is that?"
1,Don't go to jail by following this,"A number of people thought this was the right way to go... who wouldn't love no income tax. One friend tried to convince me too. It sounded great but thank goodness I was chicken! They also didn't pay employees' taxes in many instances instead considering them ""contract employees."" The book shows you why it is legal based on our founding fathers and the constitution. Whether they are right or wrong, several people are now spending one year or more in jail with huge fines for tax evasion. Families are left in dire straights; having no income, losing their homes, businesses, investments, etc."
5,Spencer's Mountains,"we love this movie, but sadly because we are deaf when they sing, it is not closed captioned. all should be closed cationed that many times deaf people love to read what they say or what they sing."
1,Make mine Waltons,"I figured since it was the predecessor of the Waltons, and had a good cast, how bad could it be. Well. Besides being truly dated in every way (the music particularly got me, being a musician), and names like Clay-Boy instead of John-Boy (somehow just doesn't work), the worst part is the dialog which is just atrocious. Tacky, dopey, not worth it."
5,I really like this album,"To be honest, I bought this album by accident. I was looking for an album that contained Brooks & Dunn's song ""Only in America"". I bought this album thinking B&D's original song would be in this. However, the version of ""Only in America"" in this album performed by the Country Dance Kings turned out to be outstanding! I like it better than B&D's original version. I hope the members of the Dance Kings read this!"
1,One of the worst TEXTbooks.,"I spent more time trying to understand the author's prose than I did trying to solve the problems. There are many good exercises in the book, but the author's ability to explain principles were far from being succinct and unambiguous. The author often digressed, and there were even times when the text became misleading. Causality was not correctly defined and convolution was definetly convoluted. This book serves only 2 purposes. 1)A nice source of practice problems. 2)A hideous source of punishment for those students learning about signals for their first time. I would not recommend this book until the author adds 3 times more mathematics and reduces his prose to 1/3."
1,hard to read and bad examples,"I am currently using this book at the University of Pittsburgh and found it very difficult to follow. I feel that the author spends more time trying to show his english and grammer skills rather than his knowledge of systems and signals. The examples that are given, don't supply enough information on how to get from point A to point B."
4,Want the solution manual,"It's a good book. But if any one who can tell me how to get the solution manual, it will be much better. Thanks!"
2,Example Problems could be ten times better,"As a non-ECE student studying signals and systems, I find that the examples in the book are very hurried and do not allow the student to be able to translate those concepts over into the problem sets."
2,hard for Mom to tolerate,"I love folk music, but this CD contains only 2 songs that I like and only 2 others that I can even tolerate. My kids seem to like it (the ones I don't hit the skip button for) but I am not going to sacrifice myself when there are plenty of other recordings that they and I both like.Why don't I like it? Zanes has a croak similar to Bob Dylan's; with all due respect to Dylan's great songwriting, I don't enjoy his singing. Zane's friends vary in talent but none of them seem able to harmonize together. The songs in a minor key are particularly grating, such as ""All Around the Kitchen"" which many people seem to like, though I can't see why. The instrumentation is nothing special either. Don't buy this just because you like the song ""Jump Up"" from Sesame Street; you should listen before you buy to make sure the rest of it matches your taste."
4,"I just like it and my kids do, too.","I saw Dan Zanes doing ""Jump Up"" on Noggin (a preschoolers cable network) and LOVED it. It took me some digging to find out who the act was etc. Long story short, the version of ""Jump Up"" on this CD is not the one that aired on TV. I was disappointed at first, because the TV session kept adding more and more musicians and the disk is just Dan & strings. But I like this disk very much, and so does my 26 mo. old son. My 8 year old daughters also like it and we sing and dance to ""All Around the Kitchen"" together. I will admit to listening to the CD when my kids aren't in the van. I agree with another poster who felt that Father Goose was annoying. I like those tracks least, but I LOVE Rock Island Line, Linstead Market, and especially, Thrift Shop."
5,Good enough for Mom and Dad too!,"I bought the CD for All around the Kitchen, but, now my kidsrequest several other songs too! Love the Irish tune and the Thrift Shop song and many others. The music is not your typicalbubblegummy kid stuff. Great selection of beats, style and sound for all ages to enjoy. Dan Zane puts more sophistication in kids music so that kids are exposed to real music and not just nursery rhyme type stuff."
4,Business plan life saver,If you are writing a business plan than you need this! It helps you get organized and gives you plenty of ideas when you get stuck. I can't imagine writing a biz plan without this!
4,Get Tubed!!!,"This is like totally cool. The music is great, only a couple of yawners. Raw tones and pure energy can be felt in this package. You can't help but get yourself moving and your feet tapping. If you don't like it, you're probably a gremmie."
5,All the greats,"I am a fan of Blind Melon. This is just another piece of the collection. Its well recorded and has all the good songs on it. I found the other version of ""No Rain"" awesome."
5,"Great listening, any time","I purchased this cd after hearing one song from it on classical radio. Because it is a cd meant to show students how to play songs, the songs are played simply, without embellishment. They are lovely. This is a great cd to play when you want to relax and just hear simple melodies played beautifully."
2,waste of money,"This book is a waste of money. It is simply a ploy to purchase more books from the authors. Each of the 34 (Yes 34 ) chapters directs you to the reunion solutions website in order to get the ideas promised in the book. When you go to the website, there are NO SOLUTIONS, just more books to purchase at $24.99. So if you spend $100 on reunion solution books, you should have the info promised in one. I am not willing to do that, and there are no other reunion books except from these authors (who are self-publishing), so I will use the old-fashioned way...a google search.This purchase was DISAPPOINTING to say the least.!"
4,Wharton50,This version is way better than the American version it's a shame the americans can't do good remakes all the same it's a good movie
5,A prison experiment gone mad and real.,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome, I WAS SHOUTING AT THE SET for that one guy Tarek Fahd to beat the living XXXXX out of Mr. Stink prison guard Berus. That Movie is so real in it's authentic form of paranoia, humiliation, torchure, you start to become out-of-control yourself. The good acting well compensates for the pace and plot of the movie. I felt like I was in the cell with him. That was a good movie. In the next sequel we'll probably see the same prisoners as the new prison guards, and the guards as the real prisoners. LOL Recommendation to anyone interested in seeing this movie. The German language subtitled in english just makes you more involved with the movie."
5,Concerto CD,It was wonderful to be able to get my old vinyl as a CD. It came on time and in great condition. It was not easy to find.
2,One Shot Wonder,"Pro: this is one of the best shapes of its kind, the design of the ""Rabbit"" is right on target. Wife loves it.Con: this is the worst, flimsiest material I have ever seen. It has never lasted for more than two encounters, usually breaks on the first use, and I ordered three of them! They are all broken (the rings split in half.) We're not talking swinging from the chandeliers, either. That's pretty expensive pleasure! When it breaks mid-use, frustration can set in! The Diving Dolphin is not as good a design but we have never broken that blue synthetic they make it from."
4,"Great, But the 7 CD series on Sequel Label is Even BETTER","The seven volumes on the Sequel Label (UK) are more complete during the classic years, and have superb essays. Unfortunately, they are out of print and hard to track down."
4,T-Tapp,I wanted something different to add to my workouts. The T-Tapp Ho-Down is quite the workout! I am actually sore after doing 55 reps of the Ho-Down!This workout makes me concentrate on my posture and body alignment.It includes some good stretching techniques and is low impact
4,T-Tap Basic Plus and Step Away Set DVD,"I got more for my money than I expected four dvds in the package. Kind of when you can do this then go to the next dvd.Great exercise meant for home work out. But, I feel the difference after just two times and want to abuse my body some more. I felt my entire body being worked."
5,you can do this no matter how sick or tired you are!,"I love these workouts i have a bad thyroid and bad adrenal glands and i can do these exercises. when she explains to you how the exercises help you, it is just amazing how our bodiy will help us if we just give it a lttle bit of the proper movements. It really works!"
5,Amazing singing,"Caballe sings these songs with a great deal of emotion and apparent joy. The coloratura is better than any I have ever heard from her, absoluely precise and totally thrilling, she even trills! Whomever wrote the variations she sings isn't credited, but they are much more complex than any I have heard on other recordings of the Italian Melodies. I've been a Caballe fan for a long time, but this recording took my breath away."
5,Also F.Y.I...,"Also, F.Y.I...The inspiration of the ""Smoggers"" storyline was from the goings-on surrounding the New York Giants of that time period, they were having many problems both on & off the field.~Hence the color-scheme on the cover, among other inspirations associated with New York/New Jersey East Coast.If you've read this as a youth back in the 70's, it still translates in modern day NFL politics."
1,Women's golf shoes,This shoe is very stiff and uncomfortable and seems to run small - I ended up taking them to a consignment sports store to sell.
4,I liked it!,"I have read most of Linda Howards work, and I really liked this one. It was a little like Dream Man (which is one of my favorites) with the ""paranormal"" stuff but different also! I liked Paris ""Sweeney"" - she was a strong woman, but she wasn't so militant about it that you wanted to slap her. I also liked the fact that she held her own with Richard. Richard was also a great character. He was supportive and sexy. The only down side of this book was with two or three well placed lines you knew who the killer was, which is to bad because in previous books you could go to almost the last page before knowing exactly how it would end. I also can't wait for Chance's story!"
4,An enjoyable read,"If anyone else had written this book, I'd have been singing its praises. But Ms Howard's books usually have something extra that this seemed to lack. Maybe it was a bit too predictable without much real interaction between the lovers -- in comparason to Ms Howards other books. And there were several fascination aspects to Sweeney's gifts that would have been fun to hear more about. Even so, a darn good book. Read it."
4,Once you start you can't put it down.,I started this book at 7 in the evening because the storm knocked out the cable. Once I did I was not able to put it down until it was finished at 2 in the morning. Ms Howard makes you see and feel everything just like you were that person. To me that makes it a sucess.
2,The book was not up to her previous standards. No depth,It seems all my favorite Authors who go to hard cover books loose some of their depth. This is what this book did. It was to politically correct and the love scenes were blah. This was one of my favorite authors.
3,"Ho-Hum, Nothing exciting about it....","I truly expected more from a great writer, this being her debut hardcover. Alas, this book is so mediocre I was simply disappointed. No intensity, cardboard characterizations, boring plot, not even good love scenes- and howard has been known for that! I can't understand why Howard has to write pages and pages describing the heroine gets ""cold"", then writes one page on the supposed climax of the story at the end when heroine confronts murderer. Hero is supposedly an ideal but Richard simply doesn't have the ""it""-- I feel Ms. Howard is trying too much to make him an ideal hero that unfortunately he came out dull. The storyline is not original either-- sounds too much like ""Dream Man"". Sorry, but this book is just a great disappointment!!"
3,"At First, I really liked it, THEN......","This is the first book I've read by her. I was enjoying the book at first. It was very intriguing and enjoyable. But what didn't mesh for me was the 2 main characters and how they interacted. They hardly knew each other and then BAM! all of a sudden he is rushing over and taking care of her.I wish there had been more depth to their relationship, or history. But it didn't seem plausible. The rest of the story was a great twist. Enjoyed that. Going to order another book from her, as I like her style. I don't mind a nice, long book with lots of depth to it. Don't cheat me out of a couple of more chapters just to get to the sex.Anticipation is what it's all about!!"
3,Pretty cool single,"Usher's 3rd single off the Confessions album, Confession part II is a pretty cool follow-up to Burn, where he confesses to cheating on his girl. Usher said it wasn't actually true, but this a decent song nonetheless, with interesting subject matter, catchy hook, and nice vocals from Urrrsher as usual. The remix with Shyne, Kanye West and Twista is pretty cool too, and it's on this single as well."
2,"Lackluster and boring, authentic Austrian garbage!","I expected something a little better than this for Agora. The tonality is warm, but the enthusiasm lacks expression. Perfect funeral music. Better yet, give as a present to your in-laws!"
4,Dog likes it,this food came recommended at a pet store and it is all we have given her. Her breath does not smell bad.
5,"Yes, yes","They did a great job putting all the hits by the Moments on one cd. Many times they leave off some and they did here too, but it's a good greatest hits cd."
3,Maybe a little over-hyped,"I decided to sell this CD back to the store I bought it from...not because it's bad (it's not). It just didn't do it for me and I was prepared to like them. 'It Is What It Is' is undeniably a good, catchy song and it is heads above anything else on this CD.The singer possesses a velvety smooth voice, but one that is lacking any edge whatsoever. After a while, it's hard to care about what he is saying. The production is a little too ""mid range"" for my tastes as well (or maybe it's my stereo). The sound is a little muddled.The music is sort of orchestrated alternative/roots rock with a pronounced Britpop sheen about it, although not nearly as accomplished as the like-minded Grand Drive.At any rate, I give this 3 stars. Just because I didn't like it doesn't mean it's not any good. There's just not enough twang for me. It's definitely more rock than roots."
3,Scipio Africanus - Greatest Man Ever,"Short, informative, and a thoroughly interesting read about a man normally forgotten in history, as long as you can get passed the author's disturbed love of Scipio Africanus. I had to continuously set this book down because I half expected to start reading about how Scipio walked on water. However, if you have little knowledge of the man, like I did, then it is a good start."
2,Hahaha Stupid....,"""Neo-Goth"" is definantly not the right title for this compilation when there is only 5 actual GOTH bands on this release, most are EBM or Industrial bands. I am giving this 2 stars only because the actual Goth bands on this release are good (and even some of the Industrial tracks, even though they shouldn't be on such a misleading compilation). This is a very sad representation for all of the impressionable baby bats out there who pick up this ""beginners"" title, no wonder our scene is dying more so every day...."
2,Disappointing!,"In all honesty, I didn't watch this movie through completely. I couldn't. It was just too painful.I've read Pratchett's Discworld novels for years and was thrilled to see that they had adapted one of his stories to animation. The transition from words to action was poorly executed, however. None of the subtleties of his humor come across in the cartoon.Nor was I prepared for the choice of animation. This type of cartooning is far inferior to that which can be seen on television's Saturday morning lineup.Save your money and buy the books."
5,Animated Discworld,"A delightful visit to the Discworld, where Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg and their young friend Magrat meet someone who would remind a real world person of Hamlet (if the Shakespeare type character had finished writing it) with a nod to Tale of Two Cities and other classics. Even the demon conjured in the laundry shed is funny. Beautiful animation, many famous voices. Highly recommended."
3,"Great story, bad animation.","The animation style is a bit too old, and the ""actors"" are really stiff. They lack depth.The story is good, as it can be expected from any Pratchett story."
1,Don't Bother,"Too bad there aren't negative star ratings. I had great hopes for this after watching Hogsfather... I was extremely disappointed! The voices were annoying (especially Magrats which was akin to a dentists drill and fingernails on the chalkboard... at the same time) and the animation childish at best. Coming from a genious like Pratchett I was expecting great entertainment geared towards adults, but this was so dumbed down for children that it was painful to watch at times. But I did watch it all, hoping against hope that it would improve. It didn't. I'm sure glad that I only rented it!"
2,Not as funny as the books,"Terry Pratchetts books have always provided us with an often sarcastic but always funny look at our own world portrayed through in weird and wonderful worlds through the eyes of equally strange characters such as the witches. So it was with great excitement that I watched the tv movies on our TV. However I was a bit dissapointed with how they had come out. To me they had lost that sense of strange humour that Terry Pratchett had put in his books becoming stale and not at all interesting. Both the characters and backgrounds became flat, with voice acting that also was not that great. To me if you want to get into Terry Pratchett read the books dont watch the movies."
4,a notch down...but still great,"I have to admit that I am not enjoying this Arsis as much as 'A Celebration of Guilt' or 'Diamonds for Disease', but it is still a great cd and this is still a killer band that deserves more and more attention.What is it missing? Well, for me, I love their sound...and 'Diamonds for Disease' took the songwriting up a notch - very memorable and catchy. I thought that is where they were heading with the new one, but I just didn't find the same ""hooks"" that caught me on the first two releases."
4,A Good Quick Read,"Very good autobiography of Ralph Kiner. He talks about everything in his life. Very good stories about baseball and others that he knew. He does like to name drop that's for sure.But I didn't mind that at all. I wish he had written more about his playing days and his own career. But I think that may be from the generation he is part. These guys just didn't like bragging on themselves. I wish I had had the opportunity to hear more of his broadcasting days. I'm sure he told even more and better stories on the air. A few more of those stories and this book would have been a 5 star from me. If you are a baseball fan,certainly a Ralph Kiner fan,this book is right up your alley."
4,Good book,It was a good book and for the price you can't go wrong with it.Thanks again for the book.
3,Rather a lamp catalog than a Lighting Design book,"In a rather simplistic manner, Sian Rees' Lighting Styles focuses on different ways of lighting house areas, but falls short on the analysis of the spacial effects of light. Packed with high quality pictures, the book's main focus is on lamps and lighting fixtures rather than the lighting and spatial quality these may provide. Well diagramed and easy to read, Lighting Styles is more of an excellent lamp catalog than a lighting design book."
3,On a questionable path,"The plots, subplots and production are definitely on their way up in season 4. The character development is however somewhat questionable. Justice becomes personal, expedited and served by Horatio Caine himself every time he can take a clear shot. We are miles away from the CSI concept where thorough investigations lead to catch (and not kill) the criminals. We seem to be once again engaged on the path of the good guys against the bad guys etc etc. I was expecting a development a little less basic from the series producers. This trend is unfortunately confirmed in season 5 which we have stopped watching. Luckily Vegas has kept its identity!"
4,Capoeira Elements,Shipping and handling was great. The dvd covers offers alot of insight into the three elements that make up Capoeira. Great buy.
2,All I wanted was the ear piece.,"I should have read the reviews, the case and the car charger worked great, but the ear piece kept breaking. $9.99 was just such a great price and all I wanted was the ear piece. Oh well, now I have a car charger; that was worth 10 bucks."
2,Ok not too bad.but not sturdy.,Worked ok for sony E. The parts are not very sturdy. The mike would break open whenever it would hit a wall or a desk. Once I dropped it on the floor all peices broke apart. No volume control options.
4,One of the best (but not quite the best)...,"I attend weekly fiction workshops; we write by hand and so I really need a pen that I can use for an hour+ w/out cramping.This is a great pen. The ink is thick and dark, but doesn't dry or clot. The cushion grip is great. The pen is very substantial, almost to the point of being clunky.The only reason I haven't given it five stars is because the Plasma pen from PapermatePlasma(tm) Retractable Ballpoint Pen, Medium 1.0mm Point, Black Ink (PAP74212)is even smoother and easier on the hand. Considering that these pens cost about the same price, I'd recommend the Plasma. If you don't like the weird squish-grip of the Plasma, or just prefer a more traditional pen, then the PhD is a very good choice. When I can't find my plasma it's the first pen I scan my desk for."
3,O.K. MOVIE,"I bought this film because I am a fan of Temple and Lon MacCallister.The film's plot is mediocre enhanced only by the Technicolor photography.But Temple is sweet and engaging as the young nurse who falls in love with Jockey (MacCallister).MacCallister is refreshing as the 'boy next door' ...a role in which he was unfortunately typecast in his 'brief' career in pictures. This remains a mystery because the young man is certainly appealing and wonderful and unlike Temple in her older years, he could act. Plus, he is mighty easy on the eyes as well.He is the reason ""The Story of Seabiscuit"" rises above its tepid plot.Temple's irish brogue is a little forced.Kids will enjoy this movie."
4,Beyond to another world,Well the Light Beyond the forest realy got me into medvievalknights more. Im 13 and this book is still confuseing you realy needto pay attition to the words. Its a fun to read book.I highlyrecommend this book for teenages ( 13 and +)
2,My Book Review,"The Light Beyond the Forest is a very ""boring"" story about knights that talk funny and have weird things happening to them. ""Acts of God."" Most of the time I didn't even think about the book while i was reading it.The knights were from the Round Table in Camelot. If I rated this book I'd give it a 3 out of 10. ...If I were a knight I'd slice my hands, toung, and legs off before I read any other books in this series!"
1,Couldn't Finish,"I personally couldn't finish this book, but that was only because I found that I couldn't identify at all with the female lawyer.If you enjoy courtroom dramas and are interested in law, this would be the series for you. I enjoy Tracie Peterson's books, but not this one.""Angel of Mercy"" is about a female lawyer who is determined to defend only those she believes are innocent, and when a man comes to her that she's not convinced is innocent, she's not quite sure what to do. When she starts probing for information she starts to wonder if maybe he is after all innocent.That's as far as I got, as I said this book just couldn't capture my attention, maybe it will yours."
5,Outstanding Book!,"One of the better works on the background for what humanity faces today. Conspiracy theory? Not hardly--if one doesn't believe in conspiracies, I have some oceanfront property for them.For decades, the mainstream media has denied any sort of ""New World Order,"" but now many sources point to the establishment of a world government, currency, etc.Read this book and think about it. I would recommend to anyone of any political persuasion."
3,A decent eye makeup remover.,"This is a decent eye makeup remover, but not the best in my opinion. Makeup is removed pretty easily but I don't know if its the product itself adding to eye dryness on my lids, or something else. This product is a convenient buy, and pretty gentle. Dries fast with no oily residue at all. This is my second or third time purchasing. Can be found at any drug store."
3,Dry my eyes out.,"Neutrogena Eye Makeup Remover does what it's supposed to do, which is removing makeup on your eyes. However,I found that it takes a couple more harsh swipes to remove all of the makeup. Use Q-tips in addition to using cotton balls to remove any excess. It dries the area around my eyes out. Now, it won't normally be a problem for me since I regularly use eyecream anyways (Yes to Carrots'), but I thought I should mention that. I won't buy this again."
1,Neutrogena eye make up remover,"this review is not about the product, as the product is FANTASTIC, i have been using for 2 years. The delivery however was disappointing. one of the 2 bottles broke in transit so i ended up getting just 1 of the 2 ordered bottles, and paid double prices effectively....."
1,Only buy every Third DVD,"DBZ is a big waste of time, because every episode is a 2 minute story stretched to 30minutes. If you REALLY need to watch this, its on Cartoon network for free in the afternoon. So don't waste your money on DBZ. Buy Evangelion: Neon Genesis."
2,Not the Eighties,"My husband bought this one for me by accident. I've been going on and on about how my original tape of Grand Master Flash and the Furious Five was stolen when I was in high school and I've yet to find the album with the original ""The MEssage"" and ""White Lines."" I think he bought me this so I'd stop singing to myself, ""Don't push me cuz I'm close to the edge,"" wherever we go. Although this didn't have the two songs I wanted (I later ordered the regular ""Greatest Hits"" album from Amazon.com), it didn't bring back any memories. In fact, I've never heard any of these songs. I don't mind the CD but it's taking some getting used to."
1,Fake,"Don't get me wrong, the film is real but edited; the audio is all overdubbed - a helicopter drones in the background the entire time while THE SAME TWO GUYS take turns alternately crying ""Oh no! He was just trying to get away there!"" ""The officer just struck him as he was running away!""Well not really - it always picks up with the second half of the chase, and for all the examples they show only 1 or 2 seem possibly legitimate. This is no ""Rodney King's Greatest Hits""...Obvious propaganda. I hoped it would at least be faked better than this."
4,Clever Book!,This is a great little book with big ideas! I teach sewing to kids and have used some of the projects in our classes. I think a good sewer ages 12 and up could independently make some of these on their own!
5,awesome historically accurate book- great read,"I first read this book over 25 years ago while traveling in Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. A trip I have made 14 times. I have also read stand-alone biographies of most of the great mountain men; Jedediah Smith, Hugh Glass, Jim Bridger, Kit Carson, Joe Meeks, Tom McDonald, and many more. I donated my collection of mountain men/indian biographies (over 30 volumes in all) to our local library.If you want to know more about these fascinating men and those times, this is by far the best and most readable place to begin."
5,An enthusiastically recommended self-teaching tool,"The Family Tree Guide Book To Europe: Your Passport To Tracing Your Genealogy Across Europe by Erin Nevius in collaboration with the editors of Family Tree Magazine is a superb reference and an enthusiastically recommended self-teaching tool -- especially for the genealogist seeking to trace family roots through the diverse and rich cultural history of Europe. Individual chapters present regional guides and resource listings for Ireland, England and Wales, Scotland, France, Poland, Eastern Europe, Russia and the Baltic Region, Spain and Portugal, Greece and the Mediterranean, and more. Written in down-to-earth terms, peppered with timelines, websites, names and address of archives and organizations, and more, The Family Tree Guide Book To Europe is an excellent, easy-to-follow, thoroughly ""user friendly"" primer and a welcome addition to personal and community library Genealogy Reference collections."
5,Roseanne,"This is one of the most interesting seasons of Roseanne... many people did not like it when it aired, but the final episode of the series explains everything, and the entire set is worth getting just for that!"
5,The best God monster,It is my favorite monster its taller the Ra and adn it durableit a lot like a figure the only thing different is the leg may pop off if its it hard enough but dont worry it just goes right back on But I coul be being bias since Kiaba is my favorite duelist and Obelisk is my monster
4,Good but odd.,"I only just started looking over this book- which I find exciting- but I already noticed something I'm totally confused by. Namely, that the in/famous Messerschmitt Bf 109 is not listed or shown. Sure there's several honorable mentions but no photos or full entry. I looked in all the aviation chapters- I keep thinking and hoping it will show up. If anyone knows where I can find this missing miracle machine that the best aces of the war loved please let me know? Seriously, I'm still looking.Also- I don't understand why the editors list several experimental non-operation Ally jet aircraft. They even mention their non-use and uselessness in the war."
4,A disappointment,"My son got this for his 4th birthday last week and loved it, even though it didn't glow in the dark as he thought the package art implied. However, it would no longer move forward (it has a ""push and go"" mechanism) after 4 days, and the back wheel would practically not move at all after 5 days. My son has not been rough with it - he's just been pushing it along the floor. The missile launcher on the back of the batcycle comes as a separate piece that snaps on, but will not stay on (not that I mind, but some of the kids might). He still likes the way it looks, but it's rather frustrating now that it doesn't move. The description does not mention it, but the batman figure does not come off the batcycle."
1,Lose The Gimmicks!,"Janis-sure liked you a lot better when you were more stripped down musically! Far too much studio wizardry on this one, especially on tracks like the title song. Get AFTERTONES or BREAKING SILENCE if you want the real deal."
2,Use at your own risk,"This product is supposedly compatible with Windows Vista, however my experiences has been to the contrary. The product will cause your computer to crash, showing the blue screen of death. Another big problem is that it freezes up too easily, meaning that you will need to restart your computer, then restart whatever it was that you were watching. This gets to be rather expensive if you choose the direct to dvd option since you will also be wasting a blank dvd.User beware!"
3,one big problem,I read all the reviews and am surprised there was no comment about the problem I encountered----it copied just fine but was not able to copy a two hour vhs---the max copy time onto a new dvd is 103 minutes--leaving seventeen minutes that had to be put on another dvd. Threw it away.
5,Awesome Product it will Dazzle you.,I bought the Dazzle so i can save some videos on my pc. Well it works great. Beware does not come with Vista drivers. But what does these days. I highly recommend this it work and delivers quality sound and video and best of all the price was just right. Although I have seen it cheaper elsewhere I really can't complain about the cost.
2,You get what you pay for,"I have a newer Vista-based PC and downloaded the latest software ""patches' from Pinnacle (330MB worth!). The ""patches"" install fine and everything appears to work. Tha hardware supplied works as advertised. It's the software that's questionable.Instant DVD Recorder works, although it's limited in what it allows you to do as far as themes and menus go. I can get it to crash reliably when using a certain supplied background music piece. This results in wasted time and a wasted DVD. The version of Studio supplied is a joke. From poor documentation(or maybe the program just doesn't do what it's supposed to do) to a poor user interface to amateurish themes, it's not worth the trouble. Windows Movie Maker + DVD Maker works a lot better."
5,Works pretty good,"It works pretty much as advertized, although the bundled software is difficult and almost impossible to use. The dazzle works fine."
5,GREAT PRODUCT- GREAT SERVICE,Quality Street is our favourite sweets especially at the holidays and now we have introduced it to others who feel the same. Thanks for the great service
1,"Nestle Quality Street Candies, actual Tin size","I love Quality Streets and was delighted to see them on here, but I feel I was mislead with the description and picture. I was expecting the normal size (larger) tin for this $27.75, but instead I got a less than half size tin. The picture is misleading with no scale reference. I've seen this often on here especially around Brit foods, they find the smallest package picture them as the norm that we are familiar with and flog them at the large package price. Elsewhere on the net I could have bought the large tin for less than they charged for this small tin had I known what to expect."
3,"Good stuff, but disjointed","This book is broken into five parts that are only marginally related to each other. Each of those parts are great, but the lack of a coherent central theme makes the book difficult to read."
4,Ken's review,"A very good towel, the 19"" by 39"" works well on hair and body.Have washed and dried several times,still works as well as when i bought it. The size is about the same as a regular bath towel."
3,"Good for its purpose, but small","I used 2 of these towels for an entire summer while working for a summer camp. They work just as they are supposed to. They dry you well as a personal towel, and dry pretty fast (over night if it is hung properly). The towels are not really comfortable but they are not awful either, they are rougher than a bath towel but work much better for traveling. It can fold up small and is not difficult to transport at all. Biggest complain is the size is misleading. The large (19 x 39 in) was not true. I have a 34 in waist and the towel would not wrap all the way around my waist. So for privacy I would recommend a larger size. Over all it is a great product and does what it says."
4,Soprano's soundtrack,"I wanted a CD of the music from Soprano's, and this is the one to get. The original ""theme song"" is really cool to hear, and other songs are just as good."
3,Not a great collection,"We love the Sopranos, but were disappointed in this collection other than the theme song and one or two others."
2,"I love The Sopranos, though am less than impressed with this","Don't get me wrong, I love The Sopranos, and am a huge fan of the show. And quite often while watching the show, I've been wanting to see a full score with all the rad songs I've been hearing throughout the episodes.And so I figured I'd just pick up a copy of the soundtrack, and it would be loaded with all the great music. The results were far from impressive. It's got ""Woke up this morning, and I.. found myself a gun"" with all the cool sounds and effects they roll on that track. Though aside from that song, and maybe one or two others (and thats being VERY generous, folks), this CD is no good. A lot of old school songs that, well, are just bad.So, if you're a fan of the show, you are going to purchase this CD regardless, which is fine. I'm glad I bought it myself, it's a great show so obviously the soundtrack would be a collectible item, just don't hold your breath on how good its going to be."
5,Wacky Christmas is Canada,"As with most of the Red Green DVDs, this one is a one-hour collage of scenes from the hilarious television show. Many of the cast appears, including (but not limited to) Bill, Ranger Gord, and Edgar ""Kaboom!"" Montrose.With this movie, there are a few off-color remarks that might make you squirm in the presence of little ones, but nothing more than that. My one problem with this tape is the two scenes where the characters discuss the existence of Santa Claus; this resulted in an uncomfortable conversation with my youngest. Consider these the only (very small) problems I have with this otherwise fantastic DVD."
2,OK,This gun is an over all pretty good gun. The only problem i have with this gun is its cocking device! This little lever is so cheap and fragile! It is plastic on top and on the bottom it is a cheap sort of metal! My cocking thingy broke on the first war and i'm scared to use it now because it is on its last leg! I would not buy this gun just because of this one reason but everything else is just fine for me.
2,waste of money,"i was a big fan of destination unknown,i really liked mest and couldnt wait to buy their new album. I found it for 9 dollars so i picked it up and i was really let down. These songs are just terrible, although i like a few. Not only are they slower, there are wayyy too many special effects. I always thought of Mest as punk maybe punk pop, but now, i dont know what they are, same as britney spears to me. I didn't think I would be let down with John Feldman (lead singer of Goldfinger) producing it but i don't know how he could back this crap."
5,Very Good 3rd CD of Mest,"Until I Met You- 10/10Rooftops- 10/10Jaded (These years)- 10/10Night Alone- 9/10Burning Bridges- 9/10Walking on Broken Glass- 9/10Your Promise- 10/102000 Miles- 9/10Shell of Myself- 8/10Lost, Broken, Confused- 9/10Chance of a Lifetime- 10/10Return to Self-Loating- 7/10Paradise (122 nd and highland)- 10/1025 to Life- 8/10"
2,Mest...three cd's and they're out.,"I'm never considered myself a music critic but I know talent when I hear it. Unfortunately I didn't hear any on this cd. The third time around for Mest..finds themselves doing the same old with even less creativity. All the chord changes were used on their other records..none of the songs stand out...there are NO guitar riffs...the lyrics are absolute garbage...listen to one song and you'll soon find yourself guessing correctly what his next ryhmning word will be. I bought this cd when it was [cheaper] because I knew that Mest was gonna turn out junk. The first two cd's were ok..by pop-punk standards. But this cd just doesn't offer anything interesting..don't be fooled by all those young girls raving about Mest just because they have a song with the singer from Good Charlotte. (by the way that song is probably the worst on the record). If you really want this cd get it cheap, otherwise you'll be sorry when you can't stand this cd in one week."
5,somewhat different,"Mest what can I say they've changed their sound somewhat. Although you'll find a lot of tracks on the new mest cd that have the trademark sound they've evolved a few of the new songs have a new sound. This may be the big cd for mest we'll just have to see. If you've never heard mest start here or buy any of the other cd's(wasting time, destination unknown), they're all great.If you don't have any of their cd's ""what's the dillio?"" go get one."
1,Tittle songs,"For any tango enthusiast it is imperative to know the Tittle Songs.The picture shown it ist not A. Castillo, but Campos"
3,Simple...but do the job,"Simple. They do the job is you are not too picky as the back part does not follow the shape of the shoe perfectly.They are fine for me, and I tend to be ""picky"""
1,Don't Get Robbed,This book appears to be an exercise in the photography of cars and some engine shots...no educational or technical sudstance. I wouldn't waste money on this book unless ya just really like lookin at 4 door sedans from Australia.
1,"Turbos & Superchargers, A comprehensive guide to forced indu","While filled with lots of pictures of flashy cars, it contains very little useful information. It's basicaly a monthly car magazine wrapped in a hard cover. If I would have had a chance to look at it on the shelf I never would have purchased it."
3,itching,"this is a very good lotion, i have mild exema and this lotion handles the mild itching quite well and its easy to apply and you don't have to use a lot to get the job done. the praxomine seems to be the key indegrendent. very good product"
5,great toy!!,"My 7 year old just got 2 of these for his birthday and he was easily able to sit , read and follow the directions to build these yu-gi-oh models. The pieces are large, sturdy and easy to put together. He got great pride in himself for not needing any help!! they do come apart easily, but he can put them right back together again."
5,Great Fun!,This toy is very edgicational For kids. It can teach them to be an engeneer when they become older. tHE ONLY BAD PART is that they can come apart ezaly.
3,Interesting,"When I read this book I felt myself oscillating between boredom and wonder. Through meditation, Dipa Ma discovered the secret to ego-annihilation while still living a ""normal"" and productive life of service."
5,Wonderful!,It was really great to read a life story of a great woman Buddhist teacher. Great meditation encouragement!
4,Inspiring,"I have read many books on meditation and been a meditator for many years. I, in general like books which teach me something about meditation, but in this case, I found this book pure inspiration. Hearing how this woman affected the lives of many of the leaders of Insight Meditation folks and many in India is a blessing and a reminder of why to stay with it.Bruce GibbsDipa Ma: The Life and Legacy of a Buddhist Master"
4,If you liked the movie....,"You'll like the CD. If you read the liner notes (as another reviewer evidently failed to do) you will see that the artist/roommate from the movie was actually signed by Clive Davis and was contractually not allowed to appear on the soundtrack (which was evidently an after-thought since the movie was the primary focus of C. Jay Cox.)So, it's a little disappointing that some of the songs are not by the same artist as the movie, but it's still good overall, and if you're a crazy Latter Days fan, you won't mind.Just the liner notes, pictures, and the ""Abide With Me"" track was worth the price.Recommended overall."
5,The perfect compliment to a perfect film.,"A friend of mine recently told me about a film entitled ""Latter Days."" I realize now that the film has been out for sometime, but after his synopsis of the story and the actors supporting it, I just had to see for myself.Latter Days (Unrated Edition). I am so glad I did. The movie captivated me from beginning to end. Steve Sandvoss and Wes Ramsey captured the characters and the story brilliantly and with support from all of the other actors, including the legendary Ms. Bisset, I fell in love with the movie from beginning to end. The music, which was so much a part of the film, stayed with me, and now when I listen to the soundtrack, it takes me to the places in the story, and I can recall them, and carry it with me. An absolute ""must see"" and for that matter, ""must hear."""
4,Batman,"I am surprised how durable the toy is. The cape and cowl seem to be made to last longer than those toys that came before. Also, lots of fun, my 3yo son plays with his three Justice League figures all of the time."
2,Should Have Been Good - But It Wasn't,"This SHOULD have been a good book. The story was decent, the characters had potential... But the writing was ghastly, particularly the dialogue. For some reason, Pella shuns contractions and insists on dropping a name of direct address into every line of dialogue. Clunky, to say the best. One expects more from an author as prolific as Pella.Oh, and would somebody please tell me what the title has to do with anything?"
1,Daughters of Fortune Book 1,"I order this book in paper back and the condition was rated as new. I received a hardback copy of this book with no dust jacket and it certainly is not new. The edges of the pages--top, bottom and sides are dark and also are dirty. I was ordering this book as one of this series that I was going to give as a gift and this is certainly not in the condition to give as a gift and I don't want it in my own collection. I could not rate this book as there is no place to rate a zero except by not giving any stars of recommendation."
4,CATCHY AND PRETTY WITH LOTS OF DIFFERENT SOUNDS,"Once you get over the fact that this album is not the Charlotte Church you're used to hearing it's really very catchy and even beautiful at times. ""Call my Name"" , ""Let's Be Alone"", and ""Fool No More"" are, I think her best attempts at a new sound and you can still catch a glimpse of her lovely soprano in ""Causualty of Love"" and ""Easy to Forget"". I also think that to add such personal touches as ""Finding my Own Way"" and ""Confessional Song"" to her new album was very brave and clever of her. It lets the listener know that the artist is singing from her heart about personal experiences instead of just singing songs written by a professional song writer. ""Crazy Chick"" and ""Moodswings"" are a litte immature sounding,I think, but the girl is still a teenager (give her a break everbody!) and overall it's a very entertaining and heartfelt album."
5,So Refreshing!,"This is the first time that I have ever even heard of Charlotte Church. A friend of mine has most of her CD's and although I think she has a beautiful voice destined to sing opera, I admire her ambition in tackling other realms of the music world. A transition from opera to pop is definitely not an easy goal to accomplish. However, I think she has done an admirable job in exploring the ranges of her vocals and the girl has things on her mind that are creatively released in Tissues N Issues! All the naysayers out there who are upset with the fact that Charlotte actually has thoughts of her own....get a grip! I truly LOVE this CD. It reminds me of a young girl who in the midst of exploring her thoughts and ideas, finds herself and begins her walk on the path to adulthood. If she makes a few mistakes along the way...then, they are hers to make. But let me assure you, making this album was NO mistake!"
4,Great product for one or two children.,"We really like the bright colors of this product. I like how they nest inside of each other. I don't think that they would stand up to several kids playing with them. They are made out of heavy cardboard and would be easily destroyed. We only have one child, so they are perfect for him."
3,Disappointed by material,"I bought these for my nephew as a present. The designs are very cute but I agree with other reviews that said the material is a disappointment. I guess I was expecting something more durable but upon opening the box, I was disappointed to see that they were just cardboard boxes that didn't seem as sturdy as I would have liked. They aren't too expensive so I didn't return them but I'm really not sure how long they will last under the wrath of a toddler."
5,Alphabet blocks,"I purchased these stacking and nesting blocks about six months ago for my 19 month old daughter. I read a lot of reviews and considered wooden blocks for fear that these cardboard blocks would not last. I decided on the cardboard because I was concerned that she might be able to hurt herself with wooden blocks due to the extra weight. I am very pleased with my purchase. She plays with the blocks all the time. She loves it when we stack them up for her so she can knock them down. Because they're cardboard, they don't weigh much. They are quite sturdy though, my husband showed her how to use the larger blocks as a seat, so she sits on them all the time. After six months of fairly steady use, they show now signs of wear."
4,fun for now.,"my 6 month old loves when i stack these blocks and she knocks them down. they give us the alphabet to talk about, and something for her to gnaw on. they are a fantastic toy for now...we will have to see how they hold up over time, though."
4,Feet of fun in one little box!,"The Alphabet Nesting and Stacking Blocks are great! Not only does it teach children about sizes and space recognition it helps them learn their ABC's. Educational and fun these blocks have provided lots of fun for my 2 year old. The only downside is that they are made of paper not wood - which is perfectly clear in the description. So, if you have a child that chews on things you should watch him/her carefully so they don't eat the blocks while playing! ;)"
5,Alphabet Nesting/Stacking Blocks Deluxe 10-piece Set Melissa and Doug,"I was looking for an educational, entertaining, inexpensive, and durable item for my 3 1/2 year-old great-nephew when I found this 10-piece Alphabet Stacking/Nesting Blocks. I don't have to tell you how hard it is these days to find an entertaining, educational, and inexpensive toy for toddlers. Upon receiving this product, I was very impressed by the fact that I had found all 3 of my requirements in this set!"
3,Not as durable as thy should be...,"They are cute, but would be nicer if they were made of wood (not paper and cardboard that bends and deteriorates...)"
2,not melissa and doug quality,"I love Melissa and Doug products, which is why I bought this w/o a second guess. I actually returned this due to the fact that it's made out of cardboard. I have a 2 year old, and a 6month old. I don't know about you.. but cardboard would not last in our house more than a week, my 2 year old would step, or fall and put a heavier toy on it, and crush it. and the 6month old will eat the edges, and I'm not sure I want her with cardboard mush in her mouth! however the WOOD version they have of these in AWESOME!"
1,Not the typical M&D quality,"We received these blocks as a gift about two weeks ago and we've already had to throw some blocks away. First of all, if your child chews on things, this is not the toy for you. My son has easily gnawed off bits of the blocks. Also, if the blocks are stepped on... they're not stong enough to withstand the weight entirely, but they are solid enough to hurt your childs feet. The outer covering also started peeling away on the top of the blocks. Bummer..."
2,Colorful but rather flimsy,"I was expecting sturdier blocks than this-- they are cardboard and I'm not sure how long they will hold up under the type of play that my toddler can dish out. If these weren't a gift, I would probably not have them. The paint is already rubbing off after only a day of playing!"
1,i absolutely agree,in the previous post they state this band is why rock is dying and i couldn't agree more his voice is not enjoybale at all and i dont think he knows what a key is. overall its just a bland CD that deserves to be shoved to the very back of a cluttered room and completetly forgotten
1,Simply Forgettable,"I agree with the other negative review below- Uninspired, simply forgettable radio trash. Cliched lyrics? Check. Muddy, simple riffs? Check. Boring drumming with a couple of poorly played double bass kicks? Check.Thank god I got this in a box of cd's from a DJ buddy of mine for free awhile back. If I actually paid for this crap I'd have to kill myself.Judging from all the ""positive"" reviews however, it seems some people at Lava records or possibly the band themselves (if they're still around. I hope not.) have been trying to plug this sorry excuse for music."
5,My 3 year old Dora fan loves this house,"She got it for Christmas this year and so far it's her favorite toy. Thanks to various relatives knowing that she was getting the house, she also got most of the furniture pieces to go with it.She has a very active imagination and loves the TV show, so it's pretty common to overhear her acting out scenes from the TV show. She's also starting to mimic the Spanish phrases as she plays with the various parts.The furniture doesn't store inside the house when closed up, though, but that was remedied here with a small plastic tote/tub. It works nicely because she can pull out the people/furniture that she wants to play with and leave the others in the tote until she decides she needs them. It's also rather large and takes up quite a bit of space when fully opened.All in all, this makes a great imaginative play toy for a Dora fan."
5,lots o' fun,My daughters got this toy for Christmas and have played with it for two weeks straight. (18mo & 3 yrs) I would recommend buying the furniture set that is sold seperately because there isn't much in the house by itself. They have alot of fun making Dora's Daddy go potty all of the time. Really cool toy.
4,My daughter is happy,"My daughter is very happy with her house She loves ringing the doorbell. I was lucky I got the house that came with Boots,Diego and Swiper she loved them but I also had a choice of getting one that had extra furniture. I personally find its better to look for combination accessories I purchased the backyard set which came with the playground/treehouse teeter totter and the table and chairs at the same price as just the playground set alone. and yesterday we took advantage of the buy two get one free sale And purchased the media room ,mommi and poppis bedroom and the greenhouse addition and the addition was the free item and it had the most coming with a dora a hat a wheelbarrow,and another piece, so go figure. You really have to look at the sets and compare prices."
4,"Great Item, but Needs Furniture with It","This dollhouse is a great idea and my daughter loves having ""Dora's House"", but Fisher Price discontinued many of the furniture items that go with it. Of Course, you can buy them on ebay from people who went out and bought them up in the stores (Making them even more difficult to find). I had to pay $130.00 for 5 sets so that my daughter could actually enjoy this house. This is the second disappointment Fisher Price gave this year (The first being the Interact TV and their website has no way to send them a message about it. Be Careful, If you purchase this, be prepared to spend twice it's price to furnish it. Or never have any furniture to go with it."
2,Dora's Talking House Didn't Talk,"I have bought many, many things from Amazon and subsequently Toys-R-Us as a store of Amazon. This was a HUGE prize for my 2 1/2 year old that was present when I opened it. After following all directions, even changing batteries, etc. (and yes, I pulled the tab to release battery charge), the house would not talk. I never had an issue before with product return, as I have had to do it with Amazon in the past. You just can't take a toy away from a child this age that sleeps with the accessories and tell them you need to send it back because the talking house doesn't talk. So, we now have a 50 dollar multi-lingual mute doll house for Dora."
5,Super Toy,"This toy is the one toy my 2 children, age 1 1/2 and 3 1/2 play with for hours. My smallest child says ""Play Dora house!"" the minute she wakes up, runs to it whenever we walk in the door and cries when she has to stop playing at bedtime. I bought everything for it very early (late October, early November) and still had to pick up some items on Ebay (bathroom, the newest furniture sets, etc.) Of course the toy could stand some minor improvements like the cabinets opening, etc. But this toy is well worth the money and lots of fun for many ages!"
1,disappointed,I should have paid better attention to the fact that NOTHING comes with the doll house.....Imagine my 3 yr old opening this Christmas Morning and all she could do was ring the doorbell.
4,"Good toy, wish it was played with more","My husband woke up at the crack of dawn to get this toy last Christmas. Suggested by the retailer, if we wanted this toy ""be there early"". I wish my daughter(5) played with it more often for all the trouble ""Santa"" went through to get it. (People were selling it on ebay for hundreds of dollars) We got it at Toys-R-Us for regular price but had to be there before the store opened. When my daughter tries to carry it, the roof pops open, a little unsafe so I carry it for her. The tabs on the side roof do not hold down the middle roof as well as I'd like, but other than that it's a good toy and she likes it, maybe when we get some furniture for it, she'll play with it more often. All furniture sets were sold out of the stores last Christmas."
4,Vocabulary is somewhat lacking,"What you learn in this book is no-nonsense useful stuff. That's the main point. Right from book 1 there is no romanization, a big bonus. Romanization keeps you from ever learning Hangul.[Audio files should have been provided in mp3 format. Converters are available, but the resulting audio quality is bearable, not more.]* The vocabulary is too limited to university student life. Try to find 'job', for instance. It's not there, only 'arbeit', something you do while studying. Many words appear once and never again. A few words are not listed in any of the book's dictionaries. The impression is the editors don't have a firm grip on vocabulary matters.*[Later addition] Now the publisher lets you download mp3 files. It takes forever, but the difference in sound quality is dramatic. This is really great news!"
5,Probably the best book out there so far.,"This is a well organized series, and follows pretty much the same layout that the Genki series did for Japanese. It's very controlled, with the first dialog or so taking a few grammar concepts from the previous chapters and introducing new ones as well. You get about 7 or so new grammar points, with maybe 20-30 or so new words per chapter. The task/function sections in the chapters clearly had classroom work in mind, but it's not entirely useless for self learners. I used this as my main study material for the KLPT, and with this book (to beginning 2) plus spaced repetition software managed to score a level 1."
1,Commercial Endeavor - don't waste your money,"This book is not very well organized and it comes WITHOUT any audio whatsoever. You can download the audio from the Hawaii website BUT - it's only in real audio format which you can only play on your computer with the real audio program. You can't burn the audio to a cd and then listen to it in your car, for example. Or...you can buy the cd for $195!!No integrated audio is the first deadly sin for a language book. Worse, the audio situation with this book is an UNETHICAL attempt to rip you off. The University of Hawaii should be ashamed."
4,Last Mountain Man/Return of the Mountain Man,"Book was a gift, it was purchased because neither of the books could be ordered separately. The recipient has read it and said it was fine."
4,Nothing dull here!,"Boistrous/loud compilation from EMI complete opera sets! Features the complete Triumphal Scene from Verde's ""Aida"", worth the modest price of this disc alone. The program notes are explained in layman terms so the opera novice can follow a story line with each track. Decent remastered sound! Hope is you'll run out and get the complete sets."
4,Dynex Personal Speaker System,"I got my speaker back around 1 yr ago. I put it in my hair salon and played music everyday at work, I had many people say the sound was great, and people asking what radio station was it on because the music and sound was great, Lots of people went out and got them and said it was a great price at 12.00 and played very good. My speaker stop working after a little over a year. I am here to buy one more."
5,The Primal Wound,"The Author truly examines and compells the reader to examine and look inside ones self, to truly reach a better understanding of their actions and reactions and to understand why they react this way. I suggest that every adoptive patent and adoptee read this book as it will help them to better understand one another and help in building their relationship into a healthy, loving one. The writer is brilliant and truly captivates a deep understanding of just how the adoptuive child feels and also validates those feelings, as well as how the adoptive parent feels.Brilliant A+++++"
1,Primal Wound Healed,"This book leads you to believe that ALL adopted children are not normal. The author writes that every child that has ever been adopted has these feelings of depression, rejection, abandonment, and hatred. My husband is adopted, and several members of my family are also and not one of them believe what is written in this book. This book is offensive to Adopted Parents everywhere. The author states that by parents adopting children they are doing them a great injustice. I feel that this author had great trouble out of her adopted daughter and this was the only way she could explain it without taking the blame herself. The author does not ever give you an e-mail address to send comments to her........Wonder why?"
3,WHOS' THE AUDIENCE?,I am an adoptee and I found the contents cumbersome and hard to sift through. I wasnt sure if she knew who she was addressing. She is a clinician and also an adopting Mom so I thought that would be the perfect combo. not so. The first part sounded like she was talking to clinicians and the rest she was trying to speak to every party involved in an adoption - almost like she was trying to make everybody happy. I would have much preferred a book strictly about the adoptee's experience.
5,"A ""must read"" for anyone wanting to understand adoptees.","The Primal Wound offers keen insight into the personal and inter-relational dynamics of adoptees, their adoptive families, and birthparents. Nancy Verrier's experience as both a psychologist and an adoptive mother gives her a distinct advantage over many authors, allowing her to handle difficult aspects of the adoptive trauma with sensitivity and accuracy. While many ""adoption books"" relate personal stories which are necessarily subjective, The Primal Wound explores the behavioral attributes of adoptees from the broad vantagepoint of personal and clinical obeservation. To read this book is to experience an awakening. It leads the way to understanding the trauma that a child's separation from their mother can cause, and gaining understanding of ways in which to heal the emotional pain involved. The Primal Wound is a ""must read"" for all who have been affected by adoption!"
1,Elementry,This book read in very good condition...it was but 4 pictures were neatly out along with info I wanted to read.
1,Don't waste your money,"The pictures in this book are very nice, but that's it! This book is not worth reading and you would be doing your bird a great injustice if you followed any advice from this person. If you want a good book on parrots try ""Parrot Training"" by Bonnie Munro Doane."
4,A good one :),I love the Billy Jack character and series :) Tom Laughlin delivers on every single Billy Jack film :) I never realized this was the beginning of the Billy Jack saga until recently but now have been viewing them all .... enjoy
3,Vector Mech Engin Statics,"When I receive that book, it is packed with plastic sheet. It seems brand new because it is not opened yet. But, actually it is not because there are a few pages missing at the back of the book. Those pages are assumed as ""The Answer Pages"" of the problems from the whole book. I had to copy those pages from one of my friends. It is mestery!!!NAY OOSOE OHN"
3,Baby Loves Jazz: Go Baby Go!,"Found the album a bit disappointing. Was distracted by what sounds like a young emcee introducing the various cd themes. However, I do still think it is good for kids."
2,No spirit of Balanchine,"Strangely danced. Stiff without that wonderful Balanchine flair. But then, NYCB doesn't have it anymore either. Costumes are horrible. The French make such beautiful things, why didn't they just make exact copies of the divine Karinska originals?! If you want to see these great ballets danced they way they should be, don't waste your tme watching this DVD. Go to the Dance Collection at the NY Public Library at Lincoln Center. Maybe they will break their hearts and let you watch a tape of the great days of NYCB."
5,edited or not this album is one of the best in 2003,"buy this cd,be it edited or explicit.it is an unbelieveable record by 4 cool guys.the music will blow you away.its an intense record and worth your time and money.buy it now!!!"
2,Disappointing,"Some of the 24 are complete, coherent, and the solutions are logical and clever. Others seem completely arbitrary (a half price ticket means someone is a senior citizan? A stool only falls forward if someone falls out of a window? After a couple of puzzles, the author's sense of humor begins to grate and interfere with the puzzle genre -- I was looking for puzzles I could present to students that they could try and solve (and so had a definite solution), not quasi-puzzles with elaborate solutions that do not necessarily follow from the scenario and illustration. I was disappointed."
2,"a poorly directed, uninspired rendering","This movie really should have been scary. The premise was good, and the way in which it was filmed was interesting. The music was absolutly terrible, and the acting was really poor. While the story and idea behind the story were frightening, as a result of it's sheerly boring nature I just can't recommend this movie to anyone."
4,Tell it like it is!,"This is a story of police work in Los Angeles:heat, riots, attention to duty, to details, passions, and and hunches. How to solve a crime (or three!)."
1,Good God---Its not about Redheads!,What a misleading title! If you are looking for a book about redheads and facts about them (like the old Redhead Encyclopedia) this book is definitly not it!Couldn't tell you much more then that about what this book is about. Wish I didn't have it for so long (I was giving it as a gift) I just opened it. I should have back then so it could have been returned!
5,Childhood Memories,"This was my favorite book as a child and I had been looking for it for years. When I found it on Amazon and purchased it, I was surprised at how much of it I remembered word for word. It brought back good memories."
4,Fun and Colorful,The person I purchased these from sent an extra little gift with the package (some crayola markers.) The kids lit up when they saw the paper and the markers. They had a great time with them. Thanks a lot!
4,Sweet!,I got this so I don't have to manually make pastas. The instructions are not that great...my husband had to figure it out for me. Some pictures would have been nice like the pictures that are on the CucinaPro 178 pasta maker set. Other than that I still yet have to use it. I did test the motor and it works on the pasta maker. I would rather have the chrome rather than the white...bummed about that.
5,great product,"I bought this for my husband who has arthritis in his hands. He makes wonderful pasta. It works great. I first bought the pasta maker and it worked great, we do not eat store bought pasta. This company will stand by there products and will correct any mistakes with out any questions."
4,Great Value,"Pros:I received these very quickly. The foam around the goggles is non-porous, so it will keep liquids out. The foam is also comforatble. The goggles are made from a soft material so they flex to fit around your head nicely. Wide range of view and clear material. Indirect vents on the side to keep liquids out, but will let them breathe. Very inexpensive. Great Value.Cons:Says anti-fog, but they still fog up pretty bad. Maybe if the vents were not there they would fog up much quicker. Strap feels a little cheap, too elastic, so its hard to get a real tight fit.Other Thoughts:Probably the best value on amazon for inexpensive but quality goggles. I am using them for my Chemistry class, and I feel safe wearing them. I will need to buy a product to place on the inside to help keep the fog out. Overall happy with them."
2,I didn't love it,"Well, I live in New York. I attend the film festivals. I go to art cinemas. So I took a chance. In the fewest of words, this simple is nothing you would want to own. Fine, rent it. It's amusing at best. It always amazes me that all the effort, money and time it takes to make one of these shorts and yet you find yourself thinking, ""huh?"" The best of the collection were the black and white offerings, Boot Camp and Twilight of the Gods. From what I have read, Trevor, which is available separetly, was originally a part of this collection when shown in theaters."
3,It's an awesome Terminator but it doesn't hold it's weapon!,This toy is great but he can't hold his main weapon. Why does he even come with a weapon if he can't hold it? His coffin opens to reveal cool looking weapons but he can't hold them either. This toy is great because it is a Terminator but it is sort of pointless to play with. I'm just glad that I'm too old to play with toys 'cause this is purely for looks. Buy it if you love Terminator but don't buy it if you're a kid that wants to play Terminator with his friends.
3,Clearly a GLITCH in the Amazon Reviews system,"Regarding Reviews for Tagalog Pilipino: Audio CD Course (Language 30). This may not be a helpful review for the product since I have yet to purchase it for my brother, who is getting ready to travel to the Philippines. But I'm a nosy character, so I decided to investigate the confusion about the reviews. I scrolled down to Heather Sommer's review and clicked SEE ALL MY REVIEWS, and Lo and Behold, she is referring to another book called Chinese Mandarin: Audio Cd Course (Language 30) (Audio CD). So, I clicked on the Chinese Mandarin link, and once again, Lo and Behold! All the SAME EXACT REVIEWS for the Tagalog Book appear for the Chinese Mandarin book. Very Bizarre!!! And, for the record, sub8hr was, in fact, referring to a book called Integrated Korean: Intermediate 2 (Klear Textbooks in Korean Language). Please don't be mad at the reviewers, it's not their fault. Tell Amazon that they confused the hell out of you."
3,"good for cash, credit cards, BUT","...make sure you have a short car ignition key (if that's what you'll be using it for). My findings after trying one of these on in a local sporting goods store.The problem with all wrist wallets is that unless you have a huge wrist, when you fasten them to your wrist, the wallet contours to your wrist and you don't have much continuous FLAT space to accommodate 3"" car key. The result is not only uncomfortable, unsightly, but also untenable because the pointed end of the key is bound to make a hole in the fabric sooner or later.Now if the wrist wallet is super wide (Amazon doesn't post measurements unfortunately) then you could put your key inside width-wise, following the direction of your forearm instead of length-wise (perpendicular to your forearm).Looks like I'll just have to stick to my less-than-sexy-looking shoe wallet, sigh..."
4,Great for riding in the desert,"If you tend to take your off-road vehicle into areas that are particulary dusty or sandy, you'll want this PreCharger for your K&N filter. Of course the filter can be cleaned and re-oiled at any time, but this wrap will keep you from having to do it nearly as often. It will keep the filter around and boosting horsepower that much longer as well."
1,Needs the clips,"Despite the description listed with this product - these DO NOT include the clips mentioned.Without the clip, it is very difficult to keep these closed.They fall open very easily."
3,Horse lovers will like,Animal and land descriptions and relationships are the strongest part of this novel. Many of the horses were portrayed so realistically they became real and I felt as if I was riding some of them. I did not feel the same way about the humans. Will was hardly mentioned after the early segment. Love scenes between Latta and Cody were flat. I stayed with the book until the end because I am a Nebraskan. It left me disappointed that the story remained flat through out.
1,Batteries NOT included!,"This toy looks great, but the Amazon spec description says 1 9-volt battery required. However, don't believe that all you need is a 9 V battery! In the text of the ""Manufacturer's description"" you will learn that you also need a 6 volt NiCad rechargeable battery that is NOT included with this toy, and the NiCad battery (if you can find it) costs over $20! Be sure you know this before ordering, as the quick readout below the picture of this car is misleading."
1,Batteries not included...,My son will never get to play with this toy the way it was intended. After searching store after store I found a battery for 20 dollars the charger for the battery was 30. Not such a great deal now is it?
1,"No batteries, never worked, COMMON PROBLEM?","As I see in many other reviews for this toy, it did not come with batteries. no biggie, so i bought the 6volt+charger from WalMart for $10. didnt work. must be the battery. so i bought 2 batteries+ chargers from a toys r us(where i got the car), for $3 a piece (the store was closing down). neither one of them worked either. so it must be the car. now that the store is closed down, im out of the $$$$ over all. sega has nothing on the web about this. DSI toys no longer exists? we are all getting screwed on this one... Sorry everyone, this could have been a cool toy if it wasnt made by a defunct toy maker. Now it is just a mantel piece. This reminds me of the ColecoVision Adam Computer, 1982?, 80% came back non-working."
3,"Okay, but Very Simple.","I bought this book based on the 2-4 grade level statement. I work at a nature center. We have school-aged students visit everyday. The experiments listed in this book are very simple. I would say they are more for kindergarten or 1st grade. They look fun, they just aren't for older elementary students."
4,Great All-Around Shelf,"Ultimately I returned this item because it didn't offer a mounting system which would work well on my kit. Still, it is constructed well, has a nice grippy base and is a good modest size."
2,Tasted too bad to use.,"I really wanted to use this product to create some shimmer and sparkles for cupcake decorating.Product was not what I expected, and tasted very bad. I did not use it.I can see it being useful to add color to cake icing, or etc.But, seeing as it is supposed to be edible, I'd expect it to at least be somewhat palatable."
5,This is more like Big Willy Style than 3EB!,"When I first popped the CD into my Sony Walkman D-CJ01 ... I couldn't believe my ears. It was EXACTLY like my old CD Big Willy Style, in fact, I think they even went as far as to steal exact sound clips from my single 'Just The Two of Us' for use in their own single 'Blinded'. If you're into things like Snoop Dogg and Kelly Clarkson and Annie Lennox, and maybe even Beethoven, this CD is the one for you. Big WIlly Style's all in it."
3,Though I am left wondering.....,"how good this album could have been if Kevin Cadogan had played on it. ""Wake for Young Souls"" and ""Misfits"" are right up there with my all-time favorite 3EB songs - but where are the phenomenal guitar riffs that, along with Jenkins haunting lyrics, were the foundations of the first two albums??? Well, Jenkins lyrics are there, but the riffs are not. I found myself going back to the first two albums to listen to ""Graduate"", ""Narcolepsy"", ""1000 Julys"" and ""Ode to Maybe"" and feeling a bit depressed that we'll never hear a Jenkins/Cadogan collaboration again.But anyways, I am not a ""trained"" musician - I just know what I like. ""Vein"" is a good album, but I am left thinking that it could have been a great one."
5,The Best Album Yet!!!,"Third Eye Blind has not let us down before, and they don't let us down again. They continue to show growth with this new album, and prove that this is the best music they have made yet. Most didn't think that they could ever compare to their self title album that sold over 6 million copies, and has hits we will never forget. Out of the Vein delivers the same, this album delivers the best lyrics, guitar, and overall material they have released so far... what is next?"
1,I'm Calling Shenanigans,"This cd is a disgrace in the context of this band. The band strives to reach new levels of mediocrity with this release. The entire cd is comprised of bitching about how relationships don't work out, and how things could have been better....just shut the hell up and give me something that at least stays consistent with the style that i've come to expect from you guys. I'm sorry, but this is an unimpressive cd. I was not impressed at all with the content. The songs are soft, the lyrics are weak and the band is only a shadowy expression of what they once were. Don't bother with this cd; move on, find a new band, pick up a hobby, jerk off in the shower if needs be, just don't bother with this cd."
5,3EB is back,"Third Eye Blind's new album ""Out of the Vein"" is a testament to what thoughtfull lyrics combined with excellent guitar work and melodies can become. Stephan Jenkins lyrics throughout the album mostly deal with the pain of ending his relationship with Charlize Theron. On songs such as ""Faster"" ""Crystalballer"" and ""Blinded"" you can feel his anguish. This album mostly rocks though as the slow ballad type songs are limited. This album puts Third Eye Blind back up to the forefront of rock music."
5,A story lies within...,"I have been waiting a very long time for Third Eye Blind to come out with a new cd... and they finally have! The really cool thing about them is that there is a story within each song. If you read the lyrics, then you understand what the song means. Listen to the words!!! Blinded is a really good song. Try their older stuff too! It's cool!"
5,Out of the Vein,".... This CD is awesome and 3EB just keeps creating more and more great music to jam to. This one I would say is almost as good as the first album because the first album is a classic, but don't get me wrong... There all good!!!!!!! A must buy, so get off your butt and buy this album right this second!!!!"
4,more of the goods,"whoever wrote the following review is retarded and apparently missed the tracks ""good man"" ""my hit and run"" and ""blinded"" because they have all the feel of the previous to cd's. this cd rocks it from the start to the finish.Though you might want to skip ""taste for danger"", this cd great for listening. While there's nothing you'd find on TRL, this cd is going to be just like their last one, Blue. Underappreciated at first, but obviously a classic in hindsight. Believe me when I say: if you haven't already, do yourself a favor and go pick up ""Out of the Vein""."
3,3eB -- i miss their old stuff..!,"this cd was not exactly what i was expecting... i still think that the first album was above and beyond their best! 'blue' matched up pretty well also.. but this one, just didnt hit me in the heart like the others. the lyrics from their first two albums are fantastic, but i felt that this album doesnt have all the potential it could have had. i thought it needed a bit more work.. esp. on the lyrics because thats one of the best qualities about 3eb. still, they do have their moments on the cd.. my favorites on this album are 'blinded' (of course..!), 'crystal baller' and 'good man'. i love the line.. ""every moment overflows with power, 66 thousand miles an hour.."" i'm still a 3eb fan 4 life!"
2,Does it work? I still don't know...,I've tried using this a few times. I am pretty bad at staying still after painting my nails and usually manage to ruin at least 2 nails per hand every time. It's really time consuming. So I thought this Quick-E drying drops would be my magic cure. I really couldn't tell a difference in drying time and I STILL smudged a nail or two. I also wasn't sure if these funky little bubbles in my polish were cause by the drying drops. I mean is there such a thing as applying it to soon? I just don't know about this product... I feel like I MUST be doing something wrong! :(
5,Very good!!,"Sorry but i'm not ok with the person who says that she's a bad singer (stupid reaction, you don't very know her!!!) . She won Star academy 2 in France.She very likes sing for the person who understand (french language first) and what she wants to express (so, her fans only). If you had seen her sing in english , you would not say that she's a bad singer like the song, ""I will aways love you"" of whitney Houston.Lionel Ritchie said that she sings very well when she sings with him ,ronan keating too so ...Nolwenn, i wish her to continue and maybe she will made an english album.BUt i'm OK that her 2nd album is better than the 1st."
1,Common album.,"If you make some researchs about this young singer, you will learn that she comes from a french real TV Show, called ""star academy 2"", that why her fan club is very active and do propaganda on every websites ,they can find. The funniest thing, it's when they try to make you believe that they are not from her fan club and then send a review to promote the album...so pathetic.Whatever,This is her second album, some songs are good musically but nothing extraordinary. Not the album of the century, but not even the worst.Her voice is faint and insipid, what a pity when you have heard her voice on her debut album."
1,Not Easy to configure,Print server requires fairly in depth knowlage to set up. After setting ip address and being able to ping the address. I could still not get my offices printer to work properly. Even worse the support from D-link support was poor to say the least. I returned the item and bought a hp printer that had a nic port included in printer
1,"Doesn't work on Windows Vista or Windows ME, but it does on XP","This seems to be a good product, if you are using Windows XP. It worked well on my XP machine on my home network, but wouldn't work on my machines using Windows ME or Windows Vista. I learned this sad fact after spending too much of my time with D-Link Tech Support. Fortunately, Amazon refunded my money and paid for the return freight. After returning the D-Link DP-301P+, I used a Hawking HPS1P Print Server for my Windows Vista and Windows XP machines, and upgraded my ME to XP, which works well. The Hawking HPS1P doesn't support Windows ME either, unless you are willing to downgrade the firmware, which probably won't work for Vista applications."
4,Nice...,"A very enjoyable minor movie musical. I do not intend to do a full review - instead I would like to make a few comments.First, contrary to what the previous reviewer wrote, the clever lyricist who wrote ""I'll take Manhattan/The Bronx and Staten...Island"" was not Sammy Cahn but Lorenz Hart (in the early days of his collaboration with Richard Rodgers).""Two Tickets To Broadway"" is interesting as it contains a rare screen performance by the vaudeville comedy duo Smith & Dale. While they are reasonably humorous, their interest to modern viewers would be that they were the act that Neil Simon based his Sunshine Boys on - a comedy team who worked well together but actually hated each other offstage.Finally, I'm not sure I go along with the description of Tony Martin as ""bland"". In real life, he married Cyd Charisse and stayed married to her for many years. Any guy who can keep one of the world's most beautiful women happy for that long must have something going for him!"
2,## Tech Support a major problem ##,"My Tv started to have sound problems and I sent off an email to Olevia. No response. Then tried calling support - had to leave a message.Days later after no response I called and transferred to sales - helpful guy and wanted all the details but again he could not help and would have tech support call me back - NO LUCK with call back3 weeks go by and now I am getting rather ticked at the no response. So rewrote email again - no response.Called tech support and left my number - no response.Again called sales and got another person.Got a live body - Yaaahoo! - could not help but forwarded me to customer service (to give me the service at home number). Customer service could not help and said Tech support were the ones to talk to. After an hour plus on hold I get to talk to a tech. 1/2 hour later he came to the conclusion that I needed service.The support issue is really bad. My recomendation is call them yourself before you buy the TV.Oh, and Good Luck!!!!"
1,Worst TV in the world is Syntex Olevia,"I purchased this TV 18 months before and today it went off.Suddenly picture became very light and nothing is visible on it, stillsound it coming. this is really very bad purchase in my life I wouldnever recommend any body to buy this TV even on lowest price. Company isgiving one year warranty and this TV is only made for 1 year.I will request every buyer do not purchase this TV after all its yourwish if you want to west your money."
5,Could be the next big thing!,"This CD is outstanding. Very southern Californian; retro yet right on time now. The song ""Dream"" is the best. It's used on an extended version of a Samsung cell phone commericial. the commercial features a young girl talking about making a movie of her life (using the Samsung phone). Beautiful melodies combined with the right touch of electronica -- cool vocals and lyrics. Great driving music! Buy the CD -- you'll say you knew them before they were the ""it"" group."
2,Overproduced and over here,"I had high hopes for this release, after hearing the amazing ""What Are You Afraid Of"" on an AstralWerks sampler. It is awash in psychedelic melodies, reverbing backing vocals and flavor, and manages to play over and over again in your head long after you've popped it out of the stereo. The rest of the album, unfortunately, is instantly forgettable, with no tunes to be found to match the refreshing blast of ""What Are You Afraid Of"". ""Trip"" and ""Northern Sky"" almost make it, but like the rest of the album they suffer from a glossy production that makes this sound like a B-level shoegazer LP from '91-'92. If you're still unconvinced, I implore you to sample as many tracks as possible before purchasing."
5,Obscure Doo-wop classics,"The difference between DWB#2 and DWB#1 is that DWB#2 contains lesser-known, but by no means less enjoyable tunes. Even thoguh I was born in 1964 and thus did not expereince listening to Alan Freed's show or seeing these groups at the Brooklyn Paramount, I still love the hell out of this music! Lots of fun stuff. Dig the atmospheric ""Woo Woo Song' by the Valentines and ""Love Potion #9 by the Clovers. Enjoy the silliness of the original ""Rubber Biscuit"" by the Chips. Chafe somewhat at the politically incorrect ""Ling Ting Tong"" by the 5 Keys and ""Japanese Sandman"" by the Cellos. Smile at the streetcorner style of ""Zoom Zoom Zoom"" by the Collegians. Enjoy ""Memories of El Monte"" by the Penguins (""Earth Angel II?""), and the Frankie Lymon clone ""Rendezvous With You"" by the Desires. But enough of that-just buy the damn thing and love it!"
4,Worked well- probably bought me another year,"This battery worked well with my Mini, but it was pretty tricky to put in. If you have good eyes or a magnifying glass you should be OK- but if small tools and electronics are not your friend then maybe you should pay Apple for the replacement."
2,Outdated CD,"The tools were helpful but the CD had an outdated file type and it couldn't be opened on three different newer computers. Go to youtube and get the instructions there. Save money if you can and buy just the tools and battery. If you have tools for eyeglasses those will work. If not get it all and trash the CD. Thank you youtube, you saved me again!"
3,Pleasant movie for a Saturday or evening view,"Enjoyable movie to pass a hot summer afternoon in a cool refrigerated movie theater. That's what they said back in 1950.Kent Smith plays a down on his luck man who is picked out by a nefarious lawyer to play a double to an almost 7 year missing millionaire. The plot thickens as Kent picks up the pieces to the mystery and the viewer gets drawn into the play. Kent provides his typically good performance in this slightly campy black and white early 1950's era movie. Notice the unethical attorney performance of Robert Douglas who 2 years earlier played the nemesis and adversary of Gary Cooper's Howard Roark in ""The Fountainhead."" This is a fun romp of a light weight cinematic mystery.Definitely not a four star movie but a solid Warner Bros. film noire example and enjoyable to watch."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I hesitated buying this DVD partially due to the review which panned it severely. I am so glad I ignored that review! Granted, it is not up to today's high-def standards... few concerts from 1990 are, but the sound is quite good and the content, both the documentary and the concert make this a treasure for any GK fan. The Gipsy Kings are so much more than a technically-perfect band and their usual spirit and emotion make this DVD easily worth the price."
2,Too expensive,"Save yourself time and go to the dollar store, buy a bag of sponges and cut them down; like I did after I got these."
2,Meh,"I think you need to be a pro in order to make use of this little tool. I usually use my fingertips and don't do much contouring. You should wash this after every use, which I find a little impractical."
4,2nd gen bb different?,"I didn't realize when purchasing, but they must have redone the beautyblender. Before it was very squishy and elastic-y, if that makes sense. Now it's more of a dense sponge, it doesn't have as much bounce as my original one. It is a wonderful blender though, despite the new consistency. Just different is all."
3,Make Up Meh,I don't like that this sponge bleeds pink. I rinsed it with soap for 10 minutes and it still bled pink. My fingers work as well as this sponge.
2,EHHHHH,"Ok, so this is the thing...sponges are great for applying foundation...but you could you get a pack of disposable ones for less than half the price without jeopardizing your skin. The shape of this sponge is nothing special and the brightly pink dye on it bleeds out. The foundation stains it, and it gives the appearance of being something dirty even though you know it isn't. All in all not saying it doesn't perform, it just isn't worth it in the long run...save your money and keep it fresh and buy makeup sponges at you local drug store and apply accordingly. I also prefer foundation brushes over wasting any change on this obnoxious item."
5,Love it!,"my makeup has never looked so good! My only complaint is that I have not figured out how to keep it clean or if I am supposed to wash it after every use. Other than that, my skin looks great because the beauty blender makes my makeup look so flawless!"
5,beauty blender,I absolutely loveeeeee this !!!! i use it every day !!!! the money was well spent !!!!!! and it was worth it !!!
5,creates a flawless finish,"this sponge is amazing, once you use it you will never want to go without. works best if you dampen before use and make sure to tap on foundation don't drag across face. it is latex free. use the beauty blender cleanser for effortless cleaning."
3,Interesting slant on things,I liked the book and thought it was an interesting interpretation/explanation of coincidences. Not sure if I agree with the authors conclusions. But it was a quick read and somewhat uplifting.
4,Great lessons,We read this for our book club. Made for great discussions and stories from all. Easy to relate and loved that it's all true stories.
5,baby's favorite!!,"Fun, safe, non-toxic, made in Germany. Great for grasping, mouthing, even shaking like a rattle. We were worried he might get pinched between the colored segments, but somehow it just doesn't create a a hazard at all."
3,Love the rattle sound - wish it entertained longer,"This was the first toy that my baby was able to hold. It is light and small (maybe three inches across, about the size of a bracelet), perfect for two month old hands. I put it in her hand, and she was able to shake it. The toy is easy to stick in my diaper bag. What I love about the toy is the nice, soft rattle sound. It's really pleasant and not annoying like other toys. When the baby started teething, she enjoyed putting it in her mouth, and I was glad it is made of wood and safe dyes.I only wish she played with it more. Although she always takes it from me when I offer it, the ring doesn't hold her attention for long. For the price and the two minutes she will look at this toy, I'm not sure it is worth buying. The only portable toy that has ever been able to keep her attention is chewing on the rubber Sophie giraffe."
5,Our Little One's Favorite!,"I gave this toy to my 3 month old and for the last two and a half months it has been his favorite grasping and teething toy. He will reject any plastic or iced teether, but loves to gnaw on this one. He also really enjoys shaking it as the blue rings will rattle. It is a very attractive toy and so far seems durable (I have tried pulling pretty hard at the segments and they really hardly move.) This is definitely our favorite toy at 5 months and I would recommend it to anyone with a baby."
5,Perfect First Toy,"This was one of the first toys that my son was able to grab and play with. He is now 5 months and shows a preference for it. He stares at the colors, shakes it and seems very interested in the two small blue rings. The fact that it is a circle makes it easy for me to attach to the diaper bag and take with us. I love that it is wood and is easy to clean."
2,"Nice sound, cheaply made","I really enjoyed these headphones for about two months. I was happy with the sound, and while the noise reduction isn't great, it does do something. But they're not made very well. I was lifting them off my head, putting some stress on the hinge at the top, but not more than I would on many headphones, when the hinge snapped. The other person I knew who used these had a similar experience, also after having been using them for about 2 months. I'd warn people away from these if they think they're likely to put even a little bit of stress on them."
2,"THE CHAIN IS THICK,.",THE BOX STYLE CHAIN ON THESE IS THICK AND I HAD TROUBLE GETTING ONE OF THEM INTO MY EAR. I HAVE TO SAY THAT ONCE I GOT THEM ON THEY DID NOT SLIP LIKE LIGHTER CHAINS DO BUT IT HURT AGAIN WHEN I TOOK IT OUT OF THE SAME EAR. FOR ME I WOULD LIKE THEM A LITTLE SHORTER BUT THAT IS JUST AN OPENION. THEY ARE NICE AND I AM KEEPING THEM BUT I DON'T THINK I WILL WEAR THEM VERY OFTEN DUE TO THE CHAIN.
1,"maybe ""never"" would have been better than ""late""","why would a writer think their own personal drama's are ""poetic""? this book was one personal trauma after another and was not worth reading. i can't believe that other reviewers found it to be good, obviously, they must all know each other and sleep with each other. why else would they write that something is good when in fact it put me to sleep. i hated this book."
5,Perhaps the best show ever...certainly close!,"The writing, the acting, the feeling of being in DC, in the seat of power; it's all here! What a treat. And what a treat to relive this series. I love having these free Prime videos available anytime. I've been using my Kimdle Fire to watch this at night. I can watch from anywhere. It's great!"
5,West Wing Season One,"If only we had television of this caliber today. This series is smart, fast, funny and educational. The entire collection is well worth adding to any collection."
5,A good begining,"A strong start to a seven-year series runs with excellent characterization; intelligent, often witty dialog; intricate but well-executed plots and convincing performances throughout. The key characters - President Bartlet, The First Lady, C.J., Leo, Josh, Toby, Donna and Charlie are all introduced and go through significant development. The season finale, with the assassination attempt, is a gripping episode with a classic cliff-hanger ending.The technical quality is also top-notch. First rate photography, sound, editing and set decoration.Check out the four minute Steady Cam shot at the beginning of episode three which tracks all the way through a hotel basement out to the Presidential limo after a speech. Right up there with A Touch of Evil, The Player and The Shining for great tracking shots of all time."
5,Amazing despite hating politics,"That's right--I hate politics. However, this show is utterly amazing. It's not so much about the politics and bills they're trying to pass, as it is about the human nature, and amazing fast moving dialogue.Even if you don't like politics, give this one a shot. It's more amazing than you might think."
5,"All I can say, it ""Wow""","I was skeptical about buying the series before I've even seen it but I've always been a fan of movies with a theme like this one. ""The American President"", for example. While deployed with the US Military, I took a chance and didn't buy just the first season, but both season I and II at once. I was hooked within the first few minutes of the pilot episode. The mix of drama, suspense and humor have been done with expert precision and I couldn't wait until I saw the next episode. The clifhanger from season I to II had be ripping the disk from my computer just to plow the next one in. All I can more is I really wish Season III was available as I have so much more time deployed and really want to watch more of this show. Several of us at work are now watching it as well. This show has my backing!"
3,"Great show, good extras, but no widescreen","It is a great show, the episodes are drama at it's best. The main issue with this release is, it is not wide screen, but standard resolution."
5,A show written for an audience that doesn't exist.,"The west wing is a truly amazing television show. The writing is witty, quick, and funny, with a huge amount of depth. The politics is incredibly interesting, constantly applicable to the real world, and most of all, accurate. Finally, the acting and directing are both top notch. I've searched for years to no avail to find any show that comes close, if you haven't seen the west wing, you owe it to yourself to try."
1,Vastly overrated,"I can't help but be amazed by the flood of ecstatic reviews greeting this book. The title and basic concept led me to expect great things, but--as both a mystery fan and an English lit professor--I found it disappointing and dull. The bizarre, quirky world of academia is certainly an excellent background for a mystery, but it doesn't receive its due here. The heroine is fiercely uninteresting; even her character quirks are dull (why, for example, constantly focus our attention on her preference for black coffee?). If you're looking for a good mystery that really mines the fascination and strangeness of English literary research, read Robert Barnard's _Case of the Missing Bronte_ or Jane Langton's _Emily Dickinson is Dead_. For a truly great read about literary research and the folk who are obsessed with same, you can't do better than A. S. Byatt's _Possession_. _Quieter Than Sleep_ is a waste of a good concept."
2,An OK potty for a girl,This potty is OK. We have a girl and I guess it wouldn't work for a boy. We got it because it was inexpensive and she didn't need a fancy one. She doesn't seem to mind using it. She does start to tip it though when she gets excited.
1,YUCK!,"I bought this one only to use the seat ON the toilet. Its a true pain. Terrible for my boy. It he sits on it and will pee IN the toilet half the time he pees all over the place because the guard is connected to the insert. Who want to clean that all the time? Also once we took in apart we could never get in back together. Yep I am on here looking for a new one too... I heard the baby bjorn seat is great, and I have the baby bjorn little potty and that was super too!"
3,The darn thing froze up,"I just got my player last night after 3 days. I am very happy in the time that it arrived, however when I went download my music, which was only about 131 songs, the thing froze on me. Now all I have on my screen is ""Transferring files, Do not disconnect"" and it has said that since 11:30pm. Now it is 5:35 am and it still says that. Unfortunately, I had to disconnect it so that I can return it. Little thing is still on. I mean the sound out of it was great and the size is great for the price. Didn't find any cases or accessories in stores for it. So now I have to wait until Samsung opens to call and see if I can't get a new one. Overall, besides this problem, I liked it. I even came fully charged and with sample music so you could hear the quality."
1,Never got item,Amazon never sent the correct order. I spend 2 hours on the phone trying to get them to send the right item. I eventually had to decline the order on the 3rd time not getting the correct amount of pop-tarts. They kept sending once box when i was supposed to get 12.
1,Doesn't work,We sprayed this on the wood railings around our deck. It didn't stop our labradoodle puppy from chewing at all.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS HEATER,i went to the local Home Improvement store and purchased this heater. This heater is really loud i could not sleep with it in the room needless to say i packed it up and took it back
1,Would not recommend,"It's very loud and none of the timer or temperature controls work on it. It does heat up the room, but does not do all that it says it does. Also, mine did not come with a remote."
1,Non-stick coating flaking off,"Overall they are holding up after 3 months of use. But, the smallest pot has the non-stick coating bubbling and in some cases flaking off. These have not been abused- put in a dishwasher or abrasively scrubbed or put in the oven. I'm not sure if it can't handle the heat of the gas burner. Still, I have to stop using this one."
1,Non-stick coating peeling off,"I recently purchased this set and within three weeks noticed the non-stick coating peeling off. I've taken great care of it, used wooden ladles and hand-washed them but it's still peeling off. I called Cuisinart and they offered to replace it if I mailed it back to them, which I did. It cost me $15 to ship a single pot back. And now the next one has begun to peel. I give up! A very poorly manufactured product. I would not recommend it even if it was free! I'm so disappointed; did not expect this from Cuisinart!"
4,Well made,"Well made and the non stick is great, I would have given it a 5 star if it was not made in China."
1,Waste of Money,This purchase was a BIG disappointment. The non-stick material started to strip from all of the pots by the first/second wash.
4,got a good deal in amazon,"i got a good deal on this cookware set. my wife liked it very much. she is planning to buy cookware set and i saw the cookware set in amazon and i ordered it. after receiving it, my wife is very happy with the quality of the set."
1,wrong not 3/4 only 1/2 tweet in 3/4 housing says so on back,these are super tiny tiny tiny 1/2inch tweeters the packaging is wrong. also no mounting options seems to be same issue with all pioneer components not good.
1,inaccessible thesis-style writing...,"i'm annoyed with myself for buying it because this is totally not what i was hoping for. i needed a book that matches this book's byline ""A Strategic Guide to Organizing..."" and in my mind it doesn't live up to that. This book definitely needs to have a ""warning: experts only"" or ""warning: academics only"" the way that computer books do. then i could have bought the introductory book that i needed instead of this piece of work that reads like something aimed at a college professor instead of a working professional.the frustrating part here is that there *is* good information in here, it just takes 4 times longer to extract it and digest it than you can with a book that's utilizes plain lanuguage, better typesetting and layout, and some degree of user-friendliness. to make an analogy: i needed the ""Mac"" version of this information and what i bought was the commandline unix version."
4,It was a dark and stormy night,"What first attracted me to this series was David's cover art. This is the same artist who did all of DC's Sandman (Gaiman) artwork and I have always found it very attractive.The stories inside are very good. They come from authors that I have never heard of before and it is good to see new names in print. This book and the series in general tends to stay away from the worn out vampyre/werewolf stories that have been so popular within the past few years.Overall, a good book and an excellent series."
3,Mann should stick to songwriting,"Mann is a talented songwriter, but she should find equally talented musicians and singers to showcase her work. Her lyrics are clever and her meoldies haunting and inventive, especially ""Driving Sideways"" and ""Save Me."" Unfortunately, her voice is untrained and completely unmusical. Several reviewers have used the word ""plaintive"" to describe her vocal style -- a better word for it is ""whiny."" Much of the time she is straining out of her range or singing through her nasal passages. The accompaniment is also flat and monotonous, consisting of someone plunking along on an electronic keyboard. The resulting impression is that of a demo tape, where the real instrumentation will be filled in later. This isn't as noticeable in the movie, but is disappointing when the music is played alone.Despite the fact that they seem out of place tacked onto the end of the CD, the most enjoyable and professionally-rendered songs on the soundtrack are the two Supertramp hits."
5,It's GRRRREAT,"I really enjoyed the soundtrack to Magnolia and I think that the movie should have gotten more nominations at the Academy Awards. That was dissappointing. But anyway the movie was great, the soundtrack was great and I really enjoyed the whole experience."
4,Great music / so-so film,Don't let the movie fool you - this album deserves much more. I saw a preview of the movie on VH1 and was convinced to see it because of the music. Don't bother - just buy the CD instead. It's terrific.
5,The Best Soundtrack To Come Around In A Long Time,"Aimee Mann delivers greatness in PT Anderson's Magnolia soundtrack. I honestly did not think that ""One"" was even slightly bad. I love that song. From tracks 1-8 I enjoyed Aimee very much. I own many soundtracks from various films and by far Magnolia has over come all of them easily. Aimee voice and words are beautiful you can't help but like everything she says. And if you've seen the film, then the soundtrack fits it perfectly and leaves you with wonderful memories of the film. I reccomend this album to a honest and true music fan."
3,Gets you music where there was none!,I bought these for a motorhome. I have them mounted in a large exterior compartment facing downwards and out of the compartment. They will get you music where there was none but don't expect much bass in a configuration like I am using. I would expect they would be fine in the back deck of a small car where the sound is reflecting off the rear window forward. They will handle 50 watts per chanel fairly well with plenty of volume just not much bass. My solution for a bit more bass was a couple of small cheap subs mounted in the back of the same compartment. It's very hard to find (if not impossible)an enclosed speaker system like these that will produce sufficient bass.
2,HATED IT!!,"Not much more needs to be said about this one. Simply put, it could have been much, much better. I found the characters and their performances to be mediocre at best. The only reason I am giving this one 2 stars (after debating 1), is for the storyline. Many films nowadays delve straight into the killing, without shedding any light on the circumstances leading up to the present.Sadly enough, the background information and storyline where not enough to save this ship from sinking (fast). So, unless you are a die hard horror flick fan, and like just about any horror released, I suggest you pass on this one."
1,Awful !,"I cant even give this a NO rating ! This movie if you want to call it that was just awful I mean awful ! And stupid ! Silly ! Bad acting !What were these people thinking ?The original was so MUCH better ! There was mystery ! Whos calling the girls ? Where is he ? Who is he ? Did they get him at the end ?I am so disgusted with this remake !If youre smart you'll rent this at the Redbox for a buck and its not even worth that much , DO NOT buy this if you saw the original as a kid and were scared out of your mind !This cheap remake is NOTHING like the original and what the hell was the hospital scene about ?Where were the police telling the girls or girl "" the caller is coming from inside the house "" ?This is trash ! And poor Andrea Martin she was in the original as the student in this shes the house mother and it doesnt go over very well , but I still love her !These other so called actors , um why dont they go to commercials like um Lee nail press ons !"
4,fault not at your door,"I did not enjoy the movie at all but that has to do with the writer, or maybe I remember the original too well. This not only had too much gore but too much unnecessary gore."
1,ho-ho-horrible indeed,"This movie was bad. I mean really REALLY bad. It might have been good....if it would have been released as a comedy and not as a ""horror"" movie. Because it was certainly funny. That's about the nicest thing I can say about it. I was cracking up just from seeing the previews, so you can only imagine what the actual movie was like.So why did I even see it, you ask? Well one night me and my sister were at the movie store and we decided to rent it just for fun, because we were in the mood for something stupid that would make us laugh, and this movie was the perfect candidate.And while it was certainly funny indeed, about halfway into the movie, I no longer felt myself laughing, and instead I found myself cringing because all I could think was ""am I seriously watching this?""At one point, the killer kills someone by stabbing them with a candy cane. Enough said."
2,should not have been remade,"The original ""Black Christmas"" is a classic horror movie. It's on blu ray now too. It has great actors of a high quality in it like Margot Kidder and Olivia Hussey. This one has a guy dressed up as a woman and it's absurd. It's ok at best if you look at it like a bad b movie. But it used the name and basic plot of a true classic and that's a shame. Get the original ""black christmas' on blu ray or another edition before you get thisbad b movie version (black x-mas). As a bad b movie this competes with 'Orlock and the invisible man"" or 'robot monster"" and others for being inept so it's one of those type of movies. (which are ok in their own way) but not horror classics."
2,ugh....,i've never seen the older classic version but they said it was awesome! and you would think that our modern day technology would be able to remake a movie better then the first one... umm i havent even seen the original movie but this one is stupid. they have great actors. popular actors. but is seemed like the director just cant write. the murders were stupid. the muderer was stupid! everything wasnt horrific at all! the best part was the music! 2 stars at of 5! because i feel the put in 2 stars worth of work!
1,TERRIBLE!,"I DIDN'T LIKE THIS MOVIE AT ALL!THIS MOVIE WASN'T SCARY,SUSPENSEFUL,OR INTERESTING.THIS WASN'T A GOOD MOVIE!DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON IT.I WAS EXPECTING TO SEE BODY PARTS IN THE PRESENTS-NO!THIS IS JUST A BASIC SERIAL KILLER MOVIE WITH A GREAT TITLE.THIS SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE TITLE.BLACK CHRISTMAS HAS A TOTLLY DIFFERENT MEANING TO ME.NOT THIS MOVIE!"
2,"""Christmas"" Comes Early","The unrated edition of horror remake ""Black Christmas"" which stars Katie Cassidy and Michelle Trachtenberg will be presented in anamorphic widescreen, along with an English Dolby Digital 5.1 track. Extras will include deleted scenes, three alternate endings, two behind the scenes featurettes, and trailers. A 90 minute rated edition will also be available with identical features (albeit in full screen only). Each will be available to own from the 3rd of April '07."
2,The first season was not as good as the next few,"The first season they started it out as 20-somethings trying to make it in LA near the trendy ""Melrose Place,"" but issue shows didnt really pull people in so they jetisoned the lesson of the week for the trashy soap and it sure was fun for about 5 years, until Darren Star left to create Sex and the City.I could be wrong but I dont even think Amanda (Heather Locklear) even showed up until the 2nd season and same with Jo (Daphne Zuniga).By the end, just as 90210 before it, most of the cast had left and most of the characters that you hoped would end up together like Billy and Allison and Jake and Jo were gone. All these new characters weren't very interesting and the show turned into a parody of itself.I give the first season a 2 because it didnt start getting good until the second season."
2,Bad workmanship,"I was very diligent in setting the chair up. It worked well for about a month. After a month nails started to fall off and it was impossible to put back in so I threw them away and now I have a back that is down to the side. I cannot sit back on this chair. I cannot afford to buy another one so I am stuck with this. If I had known that it had such cheap nails, etc I wouldn't have bothered."
2,"Great design concept, but...","Great idea, but it should be more powerful. I have LED flashlights that are much more powerful. Also, the tripod is nice, but it cant illuminate items BELOW it very well. The head needs to tilt down more. I cant use it on my car engine, for example. It won't shine down enough.Its not bad, per se, but it should simply be better.Update 11/2010: Not really living up to its promise. LED technology is marching on. The brightness of this unit seems to be increasingly disappointing. It hasn't changed, its peer's have. I would say, that its one of those design triumphs that just doesn't age well.Update 3/2012: Downgraded to 2 stars. Brightness has diminished, potentially due to battery leakage. This is perhaps not the unit's fault. Nevertheless, This unit is nearly unusable. Its a sad end to a design that won a design award in iD magazine when it first came out."
5,Handy by hand and tremendous with the legs and moving head,"Brihgt! Three levels of light intensity is a plus when using all the battery capacity. I'e been looking for something like this for a while and am very pleased to now have it. I've used it in a closet, under the hood and set it on the floor with the legs spread and the head pointed up to replace a switch in a wall with both my hands available."
1,"Crapacious, MADE IN CHINA","I work at a lumber yard/hardware store. We sold these as a special for Ace Hardware a few months ago. First off, they are made in China. They also have almost no weight to them because everything is all plastic. Do not buy this tool. They don't even have a durable feel when you hold them."
1,Broke after a week,The legs stopped going in so that you can use it as a handheld light. The light is brite but that is about as good as it gets.
5,A STAND UP LIGHT,"I gave this light to my husband for Christmas - he is a engineering, home fix it - car fix it kind of guy and owns many lights for various products. He LOVED this - the swivel feature, the tripod feature and the LED aspect - I was a hero with this gift! Highly recommended for all of its features. Well made and looks great.Stanley MaxLife 369 Tripod LED Flashlight #95-112M"
2,Poor Flashlight/Worklight,Compared to both a LED flashlight and a worklight that comes with cordless combo kits this flashlight is not near as bright. I was working under the sink and needed additional light so I grabbed it thinking it would provide better light than the work light I have but I was wrong. The light is rather weak and didn't provide the coverage I have with the work light from the combo kit. Part of the problem was my expectation that the design of it matched other tripod lights and it would replace my halogen work lights. Those often get hot and unsafe to use and I was thinking this product would replace it.
2,Not as bright as I'd hoped,"Shipper sent it fast, but the product is not as good as Stanley Tools advertises, as well as the beacon head doesn't move, which would have made it more useful"
1,bate and switch,That prety much sums it up. Wanted the the flashlight that holds 9 batteries (95-112w) that is so much brighter (6 LED) but they sent the wrong one (95-112b)that has 1 LED! Very disapointing.
1,Corroded Battery removal,"This flashlight was kept in an apartment room & never exposed to the elements. Two years after I purchased it, I noticed a red light flashing & assumed it ment low battery or some such thing. I seldom use it, so when I went to remove the batteries I discovered two of the legs had corroded batteries in them. Could not get the batteries out of those legs and eventually threw the flashlight away. A waste of money. New Energizer batteries were used (9 of them). Managed to save three which look new with no corrosion. The others were stuck in the tubes & never removed. The few times I did use it, the flashlight worked okay."
1,Flashlight,"The flashlight I received was not the 95-112W even though the description was for the ""W"" model, but the cheaper model of 95-112B. My friend had a ""W"" model which is the one I wanted.I was refunded the difference in price."
5,Best flashlight,"I live aboard a sailboat and found this light someone had left at my slip. Having returned the light to it's owner I then ordered 4 more. The light is versatile, light and handy. I use it constantly at anchor. It is sturdy and well made. I will not be without one on my boat, in my car and in my home."
2,Flimsy,"A lot of reviewers are critical of the brightness, but I my complaint is with the mechanism that extends the legs for tripod mode. I've owned it for four days and it broke. Now the legs are permanently extended, or more precisely, they won't retract all the way. My estimation is that it's overpriced at $20+."
3,"Eh, not so great","Bought this for my mother for Christmas. She wanted a bright flashlight. This is a neat design, but it really didn't give off the light I thought it would. We kept it, but I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Good General Purpose Light,Easy to position light where you need it. Could be brighter. Handy in a pinch.
4,Interesting features,I bought this for my husband who seems to need a light in the strangest places and sometimes work with inadequate lighting. This light is not that bright which was a disappointment. Seems very durable and practical.
1,Doesn't hold up,I've had this flashlight for a year or two. It has not held up under light use. Piece by piece its been falling apart. Keep looking.
2,"Poor quality, not that bright","I bought this light in a 3 pack (it came originally with a key-chain, small and large version). All 3 suffered the same fate after very few uses. The tripod would stop collapsing and would be stuck open. The light has 3 intensities and its annoying to cycle through them. Its also not very bright compared to other lights in the same price range."
1,came pre-broke! legs don't close well,"The legs don't close into the central rubber piece. There is a small knob that I assume (no instructions)is meant to be pulled, to allow the legs to fold in. However, the knob just falls out and its clearly not attached to the spring-loaded piece at the joint of the legs. Have to pry your finger into the tiny space and push the piece up manually. Even still, the legs don't stay in the central piece so it never securely closes. The concept would be great if it would only work. Stanley customer service was not available. So I have to mail it back."
1,"useless, horrible, and cannot believe this is sold anywhere","I just received a gift certificate from my 6-year girls' uncle to buy her first microscope. Unfortunately, I bought this one. It is useless. Every single thing you put on a slide is nothing but a blur and at best, you will find some squiggly or straight line that is sufficiently out of focus to give you a headache.This is the best advice I can give you. Find another microscope as this will do nothing but upset your children and thus piss you off.I am upset that I now have to apologize to my child, find a package to send this back, and waste precious time going to the post office to mail this. The company should reimburse me for believing in them and then pay for the time and energy wasted by my child for thinking she would have fun or learn something.If this review helps another parent avoid this purchase then I will be pleased. And you can go through my ~100 reviews and note that I rarely post negative feedback unless warranted.cheers,Todd"
1,Don't bother with this microscope,"Bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas and am VERY disappointed. I didn't expect a ""real"" microscope, but this one is made from flimsy plastic and won't hold focus at all, no matter how hard you try. If you want a microscope that is junk, you can get one for $15.00 - not $60.00. Wish I could get my money back! My granddaughter doesn't like it either; she's 11 years old and a science buff - she has no interest in it because she can't see anything. You might as well throw $60.00 out your car window."
1,HORRIBLE! Doesn't work.,"My son received this microscope as a gift. He was very excited to use it, but after struggling with it for over an hour trying to get it to work, it has since sat on his shelf for the last six months. I'm clearing out his room for a garage sale and I even hesitate selling it to someone else. The main problem is that you can not get it to focus. You twist up, you twist down... up, down, up, down. Just when you think you have it in focus and take your hands off the knob, it slips out of focus again. At the higher magnifications you can't see anything but a blur no matter how much you turn the knob. The viewer on the front is useless as well as you can only see a blur. Lastly the LED light is too bright and I was concerned about damage to my son's eyes.My recommendation is to skip this and get the Eyeclops Bionic Eye instead."
3,"Ok start of a series, but needs work","This book was not the best book I have read, but it was not horrible either. I liked Penelope the main character, I liked the people in the town even if they were a little cliché at times, but the one part of this book I actually did not like was the ghost, Jack. His character was the most formulaic of all. It felt like Ms. Kimberly had spent too much time watching really bad 1930's/40's detective movies and decided to model Jack after what she had seen. The usage of doll and dame and other clichéd detective speak was prolific in this book. It made it difficult to make Jack the ghost a likable character because I kept rolling my eyes when he would say anything. I do, however, intend on purchasing another book in this series. I am hoping that maybe with the first book behind her, Ms. Kimberly improves on the characterization in the preceding books. I think this series has great promise. It just needs a little more thought put into it."
3,Unique Textbook for an Organizational Behavior Course,"I was required to purchase this book for an organizational behavior course I took. It's a lot to read, but it's fairly interesting to read about how organizations have evolved overtime. Reading or 'skimming' through the book helped me to understand the organization I work for."
4,Pretty Good,"I was a bit shocked to see the back cover was torn in half and held together by tape, a bit dissapointed but it's not a big deal. The pages seem to be in tact at least."
1,Herbalife is for fools,"I don't know what's in the Herbalife products (it says ""proprietary blend"") but they make me feel sick. Not recommended. You can drop a pound from water loss maybe, but you can achieve the same effect with lots of coffee or booze, and the pounds come back (times two) when you stop it."
5,Great Sheets,"These sheets are wonderful. I bought these for my son for his birthday. He was thrilled with them. They arent a very high thread count, but for a child, who will be into something else next year, they are perfect."
5,Johnny Swings Softly and Warmly,"I owned both of these individual items in original vinyl. They helped me to realize that Johnny Mathis was something more than just a romantic ballad singer. He has an unmatched ability to convey every single heartfelt line of a soul stinging ballads while putting an upbeat flavor to some unexpected swinging standards. Even in his seventies, he still sings and comminicates each song he sings. My lady and I saw him live last year. I am now eagerly searching for the rest of the CD's to match all of the classic Mathis vinyl that I own. New lovers will get a charge out of these tunes that I was wooing young ladies with years ago (before I was spoken for). Mathis is still the guy whose music can set a romantic mood. His up beat stuff is just too good."
2,Not that Good!,When it had came out i couldn't wait to buy them but after i watch it. It was awful! These are not the orginal at all. They sound so horrible! Don't get me wrong I love the care bears but these are fake!
4,Born in the 80's and I loved them!,"i own all three!!!! i bought mine at walmart though for 8 bucks a piece. I thought these were some great episodes. These are the cartoons I remembered as a kid. I could even recognize a few. I love these little bears. These aren't the cartoons from the disney channel in the early 90's. They are the ones from the late 80's, they look Japanesse. I really enjoyed them, I hope you do too."
1,Don't buy this turntable,"Biggest problem is that there is no way to connect a ground wire between the turntable and the ground screw of the amp. If you have a ground loop that's buzzing, you have to take the turntable apart and find a place to connect a ground wire to it. Bad design. Also, even though there is a speed control and strobe built in, I can't get the platter to go slow enough to zero out the strobe. AMAZING! I wish I hadn't sold my old Radio Shack turntable 10 years ago."
3,Good turntable but has a design flaw,"This is probably the best 'mid price' record player that you can get, but i believe it has a serious design flaw - the rca cables are really short & are built into the player...it should have been made with just an RCA jack in the back where you plug in your own cables - but no, in order to reach the stereo you either have to cut the rca cables and splice on an extension or buy an adaptor in order to hook up an additional rca cable to the existing one....i have no idea why they went this route on a very decent player."
4,pioneer turn table,"very happy with this purchase, wanted a turntable that I could listen to some old albums on and this turned out to be a good purchase."
2,One Step too far,"Mike Myers is a comic genius and a favorite of mine. However, there are many people with disabled children these days who are more than mildly upset by the playground skit.Otherwise, Mike -- you are a tremendous talent. Just don't pick on kids, ok?"
5,Beverly Hill 90210,I actually have not watched this DVD set - I bought it as a gift for my daughter-in-law. She loved it.
5,FINALLY!,"This show started when I was 15, the same age as some of the characters, and I watched it religiously for its 10 seasons. I have been waiting for the day it would be released on DVD since the day the Finale aired. I'm thrilled they're finally doing it. I may be 30 now, but this show lives on in my heart and will always be one of my favorite series ever."
5,Beverly Hills 90210 First Season,Glad they finally came out with this look forward to the other seasons.
3,La mejor música se fue,"Han vendido estos DVDs sin la música original y la han cambiado por música de fondo sin autor, al igual que algunas escenas han sido cambiadas."
2,Not The Same!,"They need to get the rights for the music because it is killing the series. The music they have on the dvd season one is so corny. I miss all those great songs that went with the drama of the show. If they don't rectify this problem before season two comes out, I will not be buying it. Season one is a waste of money without the right music. Hopefully, they re-release it with the right soundtrtack. VERY DISAPPOINTING!"
5,Best Memories!,This DVD set is fabulous. I grew up watching all of these episodes in jr high & high school & the re-runs over & over & I am still not sick of them. It brings back great memories from the 90's ! Classic episodes to keep forever! I can't wait for the other seasons to come out. I highly recommend this item.
1,Blunt Seagull,This book-like object is little more than amateur hackwork. Serious scholars will steer around it and allow it to float in place.
5,Must-read for anyone involved in adoption,"If you are an adopted daughter or son, an adoptive parent, or a mother who has given a baby to be adopted: this book must be read by you!Even though it is mainly addressed to the adult adoptee as some kind of self-help guide, it gives wonderful information to all of those touched by adoption and its consequences.You should only read this book after having gone through ""The primal wound"", as many of the issues introduced there are assumed in this book.I bought this book (and ""The primal wound"") after finding out from my ex wife about my adoptive son's acting out when in her house and about the danger he was exposing himself to. I was apalled to discover how this was no novelty in an adoptive child, and how the separation from his biological mother had affected him forever. I also found so many behavior examples that described my son's attitudes."
5,The book we've been waiting for...,"This book is a wonderful resource for any birth parent or adoptee or adoptive parent trying to understand the effects the adoption process has on individuals. It is a book that needs to be in the world, and in the hands of people who hold silent tangled emotions regarding adoption (whether conscious or not). This is a thorough step-by-step understanding of the effects of loss when a child is taken from one's mother and given to another, in the name of love, and how each can heal from this traumatic separation. It is also a wonderful guide-book for adoptive parents re what to expect, as well as understanding search and reunions between birth parents and children."
1,Insulting to adoptees and filled with typos,"As an adoptee, I was shocked to read the second book of Nancy Verrier. She seemed to turn from the compassionate counselor and adoptive mother to someone who is bitter toward adoptees. I wonder if she has worked through the grief issues in her own life. I wouldn't recommend this book."
5,"Great stand, worth the extra money","I was surprised at how heavy duty this stand is. I've had cheaper, single guitar stands in the past and this one blows them away. The construction is sturdy, it's very well padded, and the arms ""lock"" onto the neck when they're triggered by the weight of the instrument.I have a Fender Strat, a Guild Dreadnought acoustic, and a Squier Vintage Jazz Bass. All 3 fit with no issues. I would highly recommend this stand."
3,"Great stuff from ""the old days""","I purchased this DVD because my father was a member of the USS Arizona's crew when they shot the movie aboard her. He was among a few crewmen who were chosen as extras. Sadly, I didn't find out it was available until after he had passed away. This is a classic, kinda corny but cute movie that was so highly popular back in the 30's when it was shot. My daughter gets a big kick out of looking in each scene to see if she can find her ""Pappy"" and we've seen him in six.As I wrote, funny, kinda corny and a cute, yet classic plot for that era."
2,Very slow.,"I am a HUGE Kristin Hannah fan! I absolutely LOVE many of her books. This one, however, was very slow. I was over half way through it before it started to ""pick up"" and spark my interest. The ending is triumphant so it wasn't a total waste. It's an easy read. Classic Hannah character development. Overall, ok. Not her best."
1,once in every life book review,"This is one of the worst book I have ever read. It seems to me she only knows one word, because it is used on almost every page. I usually pass on my books, not this one I burned it. Don't waste your money. I wouldn't read it even if it was free."
3,Idk,"I bought this for my gf christmas 09, only saw her wear it once of chistmas 10, she said she loves it but needed to find a different chain to wear it with because the one I got was too big."
4,Black Mark,"this compilation is pretty good. Edge of Sanity's cover of Mother (Danzig, not Pink Floyd) is good, and I like Bathory's cover of Sabbath's War Pigs. Dan Swano's appearance (since you can't get him with Edge of Sanity) comes as Nightingale and it is well done. He does a great job with C'est la Vie. (The track listing above says it's Greg Lake, but it's not). However, most all the vocals on this cd are clean, so if you're looking for something black and heavy, this isn't it. Overall it's a good cd though, and worth the buy."
3,Thumbs up for Peter Graves,"I can't really give this any kind of rating, but I have always liked Peter Graves so I will say that if you have absolutely nothing to watch he makes it a little interesting."
5,Grandson's best gift,"I purchased this toy for my Grandson. Needless to say, he just loved it! I really was very pleased to hear this ""Grandma, I love my tractor"". He is four-years old. Thank you so much for making his day. Rosemary Tortes"
5,Great toy!,I just love the realistic look and play of this Caterpillar Remote control bulldozer! A great gift that has held up to my nephew's tough play. Just a cool line of vehicles.
4,Great Resource,"I have not had a chance to thoroughly go over the book yet, but it seems to be a great resource for those who like Edmund Spenser's poetry like I do. :) I read part of the Faerie Queene in school, and am looking forward to finishing the story and reading his other works. One of my favorite poems of his, ""Most Glorious Lord of Life,"" is a part of this collection. I would recommend this book for all poetry lovers."
4,Great BBQ Cookbook,"Very Easy reading good recipes from rubs, sauces to sides. Everyone will find something to take away from this one. Good idea on the notes pages to write in favorites and modifications."
5,A Treasure for Devotions to the Holy Souls,"I purchased one of Susan Tassone's books after my son died as a way of focusing my grief by praying for him. I now own all of her books, but this one is my favorite. I constantly discover new and deeper meanings even though I have used this book for many 30 day novenas. A true gem!"
4,Susan Tassone Devotional Books,The author does suitable research and presents material in accord with the religious doctrines she represents. Her topic is of interest to those who seek information useful to their devotional prayer life.
5,great catholic prayer companion,"this is such a great way to pray the rosary that it is my Christmas gift to the women in my ""prayer warriors"" group"
4,"Nice system, installation was okay but required some modifications.","The K&N intake system was installed on a 2005 F150. Installation was pretty straight forward, except that the adapter plate that K&N sent was missing one threaded insert, this was remedied by using a nut on the back of it, but it was a manufacturing defect. The system gives a nice sound under acceleration, but coming just off idle there is a whistle, I have heaard that this is common from my friends that have installed this and other intake systems. Not really annoying, a bit like a turbo charged engine, just a little intake whistle at light throttle."
3,Satisfying my curiosity,"I was always fascinated by Phyllis Diller, and enjoyed her sense of humor, so had the chance to learn more about her. I actually expected more of her humerous remarks and actions, but the book was serious in parts, telling about her sometimes difficult life. I found myself feeling sorry about parts of her past."
4,Like a Lampshade in a Whorehouse: My Life in Comedy,Very funny book -- entertaining and learned a lot about Phyllis Diller that I didn't know. She was a hoot and always looked forward to her shows. I'll pass this book around for others to read and enjoy.
5,"An informative autobiography, not just a collection of Phylls Diller jokes","As a huge fan of celebrity memoirs, I am often disappointed to find out that many books by comics are largely collections of their jokes. Not so with this book. Phyllis Diller has written a wonderfully informative autobiography that is peppered with her zingers, and even though you may have heard them many times before, you still chuckle at them as if they were old friends. The title is somewhat misleading because it sounds like a collection of her jokes, but this is actually a very candid memoir that includes Diller's painful life experiences as well as her triumphs. Highly recommended."
5,What A Great Lady,"I really enjoyed Phyllis' unsparing tale of her life to this point. Her honesty and openess in sharing her ups and downs interspersed with her unique humor provided a warm and witty read. I have always loved her stage presence, and though not of her generation, I have always felt she is timeless. It was a quick, entertaining and absorbing read I highly recommend."
5,I loved the book,"The book is an honest and open account of Phyllis Dillers life, written by Phyllis. In todays world many people have to face the same kinds turmoil she did. Leaving out the unfortunate details and circumstance's she faced, and sugar coating everything, would not have made the book atrue biography. Phyllis was certainly a victim of circumstances, but herdrive and openness, is what made her one of the greatest commedians who ever lived, and made her loved by many, many people."
3,SUBTITLES,EVERYTHING WAS GREAT BUT NONE OF THE SIX SEASONS HAVE SPANISH SUBTITLES. TODAY EVERY DVD COMES WITH 6 OR 7 LANGUAGES BUT OTHER THAN THAT NO PROBLEM
2,It's worth what you pay for it: $30.,"Most folks don't know that really fine CD Players cost $1000 or more, because of the complicated audio technology actually required to make a ""musical device"" as opposed to a jog-along laser box. For under $150, there are some outstanding portable players. But that's all they are. High-quality portable players; not audiophile sound gear. With the $400 Bose headphones, which are precise but not especially musical, try a high-end tube headphone amplifier. Once you hear what is really on the CD, and what the earphones can do, you'll be in the market for a high-end tube CD player in the $500 to $1000 range. Just because it's ""Bose"" doesn't mean it's worth any more than a good Sony or Panasonic walkman. And Bose disowned and discontinued this CD Player very quickly. For the benefit of the justly disgruntled buyer, in tiny print in the manual Bose recommends 6V DC 350MA AC ADAPTER.I hope some of this helps."
2,Not for Me,"I ended up having to buy this when the other brand I usually got was out of stock.Pros: Pleasant, olive-oil scent. Thick and creamy. Non-greasy. Easily absorbed.Cons: Did not work as well as other brands- didn't feel that this worked at all because I felt absolutely horrible. I regret not shopping other stores for my usual brand. I realize individual body chemistry is different in other people, but this was an extreme difference. I had horrible PMS-headaches, mood swings, irritability, bloating, anxiety, depression. With the other brands I used (Pharmacist's Ultimate Health and Source Naturals), I did not feel this miserable. I will not uses this product again, but maybe it works for other women. Note: this is only 450mg of progesterone per ounce; the other brands offer 500mg of progesterone per ounce."
1,Not good....,"This is my 3rd Kodak Camera (I have also bought Kodak's for my Mom and young son). It is the worst. I am taking it back tomorrow. The green light, that another reviewer mentioned, is annoying. I did take it to a Holiday program at my son's school and not one picture turned out. I spent more time dealing with the camera than watching my boys. People kept turning and looking at me when I took a picture(it was the green light). All of my pictures had horriable red eye. All of my pictures were grainy. My friend was sitting next to me and her Cannon was taking awesome pictures. So it was not the conditions.Who is the quality control person at Kodak and why would they let a product like this go out on the market? Shame on Kodak. I also bought my Mom the Kodak 7.1 for Christmas lets just hope it works better or it will also be returned.I am going to look at a Cannon...."
2,Flash gone bust,"Just after two years of use, the flash is gone bust. It is no use to get it repaired as you can get a canon powershot for less than the cost of repair. So no more KODAK products for me."
1,Worst camera I have ever owned!,"We recently took a trip to Disney. In anticipation of this trip, I asked for a new camera for Christmas. I even picked out this one out. Next time I will do more research. First of all, even with new batteries, it does not stay turned on unless it wants to. It plays dead for ten, twenty minutes even, and then all of a sudden, when your photo-op is gone, it turns back on. We missed sooo many pic of the kids during our trip because this camera couldn't seem to make up its mind. And new batteried didn't help. Finally, on our last day at Disney, I turned on the camera to discover that somehow ALL of the 275+ pictures I had taken had somehow deleted!!! I was devestated! Thank God for photo recovery software. This camera is going back to the store tomorrow, and I will be purchasing a Nikon or a Canon."
3,Drains batteries within MINUTES,"I love Kodak so much. The lens and features on this particular model are excellent. The picture quality with still and video are outstanding! THE ONLY PROBLEM, WHICH IS A HUGE PROBLEM, IS IT ONLY KEEPS A CHARGE FOR A FEW MINUTES. Then its time to go get the other rechargeable AA batteries to continue taking more pics. I use rechargable batteries, but they only last literally 3 minutes. Its so maddening! I own 3 Kodak cameras, this is the only one where there is no viewfinder, just a LCD screen. Thats what eats batteries. I paid a lot for this camera at the time. A year ago. Its a wonderful camera, despite the battery issue. So I dont take it anywhere, I use my others with rechargable lithium-ion batteries. :("
4,Christmas Gift,"Seller shipped quickly. Toy was in excellent condition. Excellent price...much better than what the stores offered at the time. Bought as a Christmas gift for my niece, so I am uncertain as to the performance and such from use."
5,Good Reference Book,"It contains many of the common phrases an intermediate level learner will approach, and is great for a fast review of conjugations."
5,Does anyone remember Peter & the Wolf?,"It was an AWESOME dance/club song. I wonder why that 12"" is never included in any of these remixes. If you want to remember what it was, you can see it at youtube under peter & the wolf italo disco."
5,Nice piece for music collection,"I bought this for one song that was no longer available to buy on it's own. With that in mind, I'm glad to have the other songs too. You know how you get that feeling from way way way back in your mind and things you haven't thought about in years come back? That's what happened when this was playing in the background. Good music from the teenage and early twenties of my life."
4,"Gripping, Intriguing alternate history of the Space Race","As a space history 'buff', I truly enjoyed this book. It takes the dream of landing a man on Mars and turns it into a plausible reality, sprinkled with ""official"" government documents such as memorandum to the president and all that. The characters are diverse and intelligent, making the human element of this fictional space flight as interesting as the technical elements. My only gripe (a small one) is the manner in which this alternate timeline followed events in the real one. There's another space disaster (much like Apollo 1) that forces the United States to consider abandoning the program, and several key developers of the program are fired or reassigned as a result. Despite that, I strongly recommend it to anyone who wants to see a human walk on another planet."
3,"Good Book, Disappointing ending",I likd the book a lot. I wish he had written more about them being on Mars insted of writing so much about how they got there.
3,An Okay Film,"I had high hopes for Candida Royalle's Femme films - it takes more than crotch shots and gargantuan breasts to get my attention. I do like a bit of smut, but I also like some romance - sensuality.The quality was lower than I expected, making this movie seem cheap. It was kind of cheesy, had a couple of decent scenes, but nothing really memorable (as in, this will be staying in the back of my video drawer, most likely.)One good thing: The male actor, ""Robert"", was attractive. I usually don't find men that appealing in these kinds of movies - okay - porn. But he was actually good-looking, in my own opinion.I wouldn't suggest this film. If you're into stuff more softcore, try one of Playboy's fantasies films. Sensual, with decent amouts of nudity. I actually really like Playboy."
3,"Unfortunately, not one of my son's favorites.","As compared to a lot of the other Baby Einstein videos for this age group, this is one of my son's least favorites. He just doesn't seem interested."
3,gweedo,"Decent video with good images, contrasting colors, etc. However the box states ""9 to 18 months"". I would wait until the kid is a good 12 to 14 months. Our 10 month old enjoys the Einstein videos that he has, but has no patience whatsoever for this one. There is too much of a story and not enough emphasis on cartoon-like colors and baby-friendly sounds. Good one, though, for older tot's..."
2,Other Einsteins are better,"My son's least favorite of the Baby Einstein videos. Baby Mozart, Bach, Shakespeare, etc. are much better choices. Unlike those, this one is quite boring and sometimes annoying."
4,Baby Enjoys It,"This is a very nice video, babies seem to enjoy it...my 15 month loves to watch it, she laughs and giggles every time she sees the movie.The Disney controversy is up to you to decide, but I feel the video is as good as the ""old"" ones, just a slightly different style."
4,"Interesting for Baby, Pleasing for Mommy","I have 2 Baby Einstein DVDs. My baby prefers My First Signs, but will watch this DVD also. I rarely play them for him, but when I really need to get something done and can't chase him around the house, it is nice to be able to let him play on the floor and watch the DVD. The music is pleasing and not annoying like most baby products. I don't believe this is teaching him anything, but as seldom as he watches it, I don't think it is hurting him either. The scenes are very pretty, but I doubt a baby understands much of what they are seeing. My child is interested and really gets excited when the puppets show up. It is nice how they mix the scenes."
5,GREAT DVD,Can't go wrong with Baby Einstein items.Adorable movie and great learning tool.Will purchase more and more titles to have here and as gifts.
4,You child might be too old for this video,"If you child is over 9 months old, you may want to skip this video and purchase the other videos in the series. I bought this one and Baby Mozart at the same time, my 9 months old definitely prefers Baby Mozart."
1,funny connection....,"this video was made in littleton, colorado... anyone remember eric harris and dylan klebold? were they baby einsteins? makes one wonder...."
2,Too much real life video,"My 10 month old daughter could care less when the video cuts away to the ""real life"" scenery. This video really strayed from the normal Baby Einstein videos we have. Instead of it being pretty much constant one toy/puppet after another, it cuts away to pictures of water and oceans and my daughter loses interest."
2,more hype than substance,"i bought the complete set, all the dvds and flash cards. i was disappointed. the only thing worth watching at all was the theatre. but before you can get to that. it goes through a very long and arduous introduction period. i always have to manually skip this whole section, C'mon i know this is the baby einstein company, but damn can we just get to the program.."
1,Language exposure might start with the alphabet?,"I did not like this video and neither did my 10 month old son. My son does, however, enjoy the baby davinci DVD which teaches body parts. I do believe in exposing children to other languages, but maybe something simple like the alphabet and numbers would be a good place to start instead of phrases and stories told in different languages that I can not even translate for my son. Simple images such as a cow followed by cow in english, french, spanish etc.. might be more interesting and educational. When this video started playing I immediately checked the language on the video to make sure it was English! I'm not sure if I'll be able to return this video but I will by attempting to do so later today!"
4,My daughter likes this DVD as much as the others.,"My 2 year old loves this DVD - just like she loves all Baby Einstein DVDs! She loves the turtle and all of the water shown in this DVD. Kids naturally love the water and my daughter is no exception. She will usually watch this whole DVD, dancing around the entire time. I definitely recommend this one."
1,Don't waste your money on this one,"I've always been very curious about these Baby Einstein videos and saw one at my friend's house a few months ago. I thought it was boring and so did my friend's 1 year old daughter because she fell asleep. Since I have a 3 month old, I thought I'd purchase the Language Nursery to expose my daughter to other languages. I would think that as the other languages are being spoken, there would be some English subtitles. I know the video isn't supposed to be teaching me foreign languages but what good is it if you keep hearing different languages but are totally clueless and to what is being said. My opinion is that these Baby Einstein videos aren't going to boost my child's IQ so I won't be adding any more to my DVD collection. Another reviewer said these videos are as fun to watch as it is to watch paint dry. I agree."
4,It made my 3-month-old squeal with delight!,"Although we limit the amount of TV our daughter watches, we let her start watching this video at 3 months for the colors and movement. She actually squealed with delight each time she watched it!The video shows colorful graphics and toys while people say the alphabet, count to 20 or say a nursery rhyme in many languages. I only wish there were a translation for each nursery rhyme with the video.We have several other Baby Einstein videos and this one and Baby Shakespeare are her favorite! We like the music on Baby Bach, but agree that the videography is not as good and there are too many features of Julie Clark's children."
2,Boring - a disappointment,"Got this tape as a shower gift and it seemed like a good idea - but I must say that my little son is absolutely bored with this tape. Plus, frankly, there are others he likes much better and will watch and ""talk"" to much more actively (his current favorites are the two ""Brainy Baby"" tapes) and this tape looks a little like it was videotaped in someone's garage.Sorry, but there are better tapes out there."
3,Not the best Baby Einstein DVD,"It's okay, but not great-doesn't have the good bonus material a lot of the other BE videos have-"
1,Just Horrible,The content is poor and cheaply done. Spoken words don't match image presented. Example: They show clock and count till 30. They would point to a number and pronounce completely different one. While pronouncing Alphabet of one of the languages they were showing cubes with numbers. While singing Russian song about geese they showed toy pig and ram.Outrageous... I can't believe anyone would keep this material let alone show to a child.
1,Thank goodness it was a gift,It is the worst DVD we have ever recieved. Don't buy it!!! She loves Baby Mozart a lot better.
1,Baby Einstein making parents look stupid!,"I'm with the reviewer ""WAYYY OVERrated"" on this one. We get swindled into paying a lot of money for these cheaply made products. The name is very persuasive and i suppose we're hopeful it will really have that effect.My daughter is no more fascinated by this DVD than she is by any number of random and unexplainable things that catch her eye on regular TV. I find that PBS has some great shows for free that actually teach her. I was amazed when after one show Grover had her trying to say ""up"" and ""down"". She's only 13months so it came out sounding like ""ut"" ""dow"" and she was raising and lowering her hands very excitedly. She doesn't ever interact with the Baby Einstein. She only stares at it mesmerized like when she saw the teletubbies, which scared me to no end.I say, save yourself some money and tape your (and baby's) favorite shows from PBS and repeat those. They are far better quality and so much more educational."
1,Overload,"I love Baby Einstein products, but I was very disappointed with this one & glad I was able to take it out of the library before buying it! We are a bilingual family with some knowledge of a number of other languages. Even tho' our son is only 5 months old - he cried through this entire volume. The pictures do not match the translations which can be very confusing for a child trying to actually catch on to a language. If this is just to hear other languages being spoken - I'd rather take a bus. The pictures aren't even the usual ""eye catching"" visuals & when counting is being done, it's not even in sync with the picture. We were really looking forward to this item as a learning tool, but will be looking for other audio/visual methods. Unfortunately, there is not much out there. Overall, this was a good concept, but got ""lost in the translation"""
1,Don't Buy This One! The Others in the Series are BETTER!,"Loved the other Baby Einstein DVD's I have for my daughter (Mozart, Both Animals and the Neptune), but this one is a BUST! I couldn't get my daughter to watch this again if I sat her down with a bag of cookies (which I WOULDN'T!) in front of it. Boring, odd and slow! Listening to it will drive you nuts."
1,VERY disappointing,"We have couple of baby Einstein videos and my son loves them - except for this one. I was very disappointed, unlike the other BE videos, this one is boring and he won't pay attention to it. Using of so many languages in this video is confusing for kids {if they actually watched it} and I don't get what is the point of it. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,Great to snooze through,"I watched this video at least half a dozen times with my five month old grandaughter. If you or baby cannot or will not fall asleep, this is the video for you. It's as entertaining as watching paint dry. A smile and a hug says ""I love you"" in any language and you need not be Einstein, to teach your baby how to talk."
1,VERY BAD,"I agree that it's wonderful for babies to hear the sounds of other languages, but what is being spoken should relate to what is seen on the television screen. The concept is good, but the quality of this is very poor.Unrelated to this dvd ... why does amazon require an email address from adults ... adults should be able to write reviews without requiring such information."
3,Definitely for the older infant,"My four-month-old loves his other Baby Einstein DVDs -- he enjoys hearing the music and watching the colors, shapes, and motion. At first he would just stare in amazement at the screen; now he laughes and ""talks"" to the screen. I expected that he would like Baby Neptune as well. He gets so excited when he sees the green FBI warning, knowing that one of his movies is beginning. He watched the first few minutes of Baby Neptune and then started screaming. Instead of the lovely music, shapes, and colors like other Baby Einstein videos, Baby Neptune has real life footage -- children playing in a puddle of water, a whale jumping out of the sea, etc. Definitely not so exciting to a four month old. So I'll try again when he's a bit older."
5,We love it!,"My 2-year-old STILL digs out videos from the ""Baby Einstein"" series and demands them in preference to all others. He went through periods of obsession with ""Buzz"" and ""Tubbies"" and ""Bluey-Ooo"", and I almost retired the Baby Einstein ilk, but they keep coming back into favor and will soothe him back into good humor when nothing else has worked. They also soothe ME-- when my nerves are shot and the cartoons are driving me nuts, I can put on one of these and enjoy the classical music. I like Baby Einstein over the others in the series because I really do believe in the value of early exposure to foreign language. I frequently buy this for gifts for expecting friends (along with Numbers & Shapes in Spanish and Bilingual Baby)."
1,Not a great DVD at all,"The languages and images don't connect. We were given this as a gift because of the linguistic value, but instead the entire dvd doesn't offer it. The other dvds in this collection are great. This one failed to teach anything."
1,Not worth the money!,"I recieved this DVD as a gift from a friend of mine who is a pre-school teacher who claimed this was one of the best videos for young children around. I happen to highly disagree. The age range on this DVD is 1-18 months, however when putting it on my for child at a young age he would cry. I agree with another reviewer when they said it speaks other lanuages but there are no sub titles to go along with it. I would like to know what at least my child it being taught. I was very disapointed with this baby einstein video, i wish i had returned it when i had the chance for it now just sits in a box."
3,Baby Neptune doesn't quite float,"My 16-month-old has been addicted to Baby Einstein videos for months, but she doesn't seem to like this one much. It does not have as many toys and puppets skits as the previous releases. It is lacking in charm as well. I notice in the credits that the production people are all different and Julie Clark is barely mentioned. I think she should come back to the reins here. It does have some great photography and I think my daughter will like it more at at older age."
3,Disappointing,"My son loves all of his Baby Einsten videos and he has absolutely no interest in this one. Also, I noticed that the sound quality of this ... is REALLY terrible on the VHS versions. I did not want to spend the $$ on the DVD's since I figure that my son will not be into these forever, but it seems as though there is a problem with the quality of the VHS. All of the other videos are fine as far as the sound goes. I was also disappointed to hear many of the same musical pieces as are in the other videos. With so much classical music to choose from, why go with the same stuff? Overall, a big bummer, especially after the other B.E. videos were so wonderful."
3,"Fun, but not in my child's favorite two videos.","This video is not as involving for my seven month old boy as his two favorite videos...""Baby Einstein"" and ""Singing Babies Toddler Tunes."" The later possibly being his absolute, hands- down favorite. However, ""Baby Neptune"" does hold his attention in parts. I recommend this video for those committed to owning the full library of Baby Einstein products."
1,much overhyped,My daughter started crying everytime I played this for her. She hated it. If you get as a gift ok. But save your money and buy barney or something from Elmo's World. They'll enjoy that alot more.
1,Boring and amaturish,"My daughter, I, and the 4 month old baby found this DVD so boring it wasn't holding anyone's attention. The voiceovers were not professional, the pictures were slow to load and most did not move at all, the instructions were difficult to master, the music was terrible, and I will buy no other Einstein products."
4,"This one is good, but not the best","Baby Neptune is good, but my son doesn't absolutely love it like he does some other Einstein DVD's. I think the music is not as good as in the others. But we still watch it so we don't get too sick of the other ones, and it's not bad. Baby Galileo is much better in my opinion."
3,Not as enthralling as the rest of the series,"From the age of one year, my son was totally mesmerized by Baby Bach and Baby Mozart, but Baby Einstein left him a little cold. Focusing as it does on nursery rhymes in numerous languages sung by women from around the world, it just couldn't hold his attention the way that the well-orchestrated music of the other videos in the series did, and he showed no interest in learning all these other languages (he's already bilingual Japanese/English). Perhaps if he had started watching this video when he was under the age of one it might have held more attraction for him, but as he can now express his own preferences, he prefers other videos to this one and won't sit still through it at the age of 2."
3,Not a bad way to kill 30 minutes,"Julie Clark is capitalizing (perhaps not on purpose) by whipping up parents to think that if children hear some foreign language sounds for (less than) 30 minutes a day, their minds will somehow become super-sponges with greater capacities, and will be more likely to understand languages. Shame! It's the same principle of rats getting cancer from eating artificial sweetners--sure they will in HUGE doses. Thus, my child and everyone else's will NOT become language experts even by watching this tape every day. On the other hand, the toys are nice to watch, my daughter enjoys the sounds and sights, and it can serve to calm/entertain when needed. Sooo, even though I question Ms. Clark's motives (or at least her sales pitch), it's still a worthwhile video."
1,Not a helpful book,"This is not a very good book to learn from. While it does have some useful example problems, the explanations are not very elucidating and the chapter problems often expect you to make assumptions that I don't think it's natural to make.For example, in solving problem 4.9, you need to flip back 45 pages to Example 4.3 and use a chart for the machine described there. However, problem 4.9 never indicates that its machine shares these characteristics, or that you ought to assume they are the same. There have been a few other times when our professor has forewarned us that the wording in the homework problems is inexact, does not give us all the information we need, or gives us erroneous information.I would not recommend this book to someone trying to study electric machines, especially if you're trying to learn it on your own."
1,"The title is a lie, and thats a just the cover!","No interview in three days. A contact maybe in three, but I dislike a title of a book that lies. Her expereince is limited with even her bio stating that she has fifteen years experience in the industry with three different companies since college?Correct me if I am wrong, but that puts this self proclaimed expert in her mid thirties and she's been with three different organizations and yet never advanced to a management position where she would actually conduct an interview? Please, SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
2,Not as good as I expected,They are OK - not worth the hype. Trying to figure out how to use the remaining 5 bags. I hope the next batch of cookies sways me to LOVING them.
2,Hershey's cinnamon chips,"These chips are wonderful in scones and other recipes, hard to find in local stores.I was very disappointed that they melted in transit. , was unable to use half of the order.L Bechtle"
1,Price markup for the holidays is REDICULOUS!!!!!,"I purchased this exact item, 6 Pack Hershey's Cinnamon Chips on Oct. 26, 2011, and the price was $15.43. Today, November 16, 2011, exactly 3 weeks later, I thought I would purchase more for the upcoming holidays only to find the price has been marked up to $27.95. This is ABSOLUTE ROBBERY. You mean to tell me they almost DOUBLED in price in a 3 week span? And I'm supposed to believe the holidays coming had nothing to do with it? And in a time when people do good just to get by... While I highly recommend the product(I myself use them to make Pumpkin muffins), I cannot condone this sort of business practice. If I am to purchase this item again on here you can believe it will NOT be until the price has returned to what it was 3 weeks ago. I am only giving one star to reflect my disgust with the company, not the product. Shame on you Amazon."
2,Big Blues cd,"Didn't realize it was for kids, some of the songs were really good. Not something I will listen to on a regular basis."
2,Now Foods CoQ10 Powder,"We really wanted to like this, as it had good reviews, and it's more economical than pills/caps. Unfortunately(as some reviewers reported), the powder sticks terribly everywhere (to the bottle, to your hands when trying to dig out the scoop, to the actual scoop), making it difficult to get it scooped out and measured accurately. It doesn't at all either, in water, in tomato juice ... unless maybe it would mix into a blender drink/smoothy - not convenient for daily use. So, the reason I got it was mainly for my husband(who is not a morning smoothy fan), but he won't use it because of it's inconveniences(and I can't blame him)... So now it's just me trying to use this stuff. Disappointing."
4,wireless bluetooth,This wireless bluetooth is exceptional for the cost. The battery dies fast and I am having a difficult time finding this size battery(AAAA)in regular stores.
1,Try this,"We recently purchased a solar powered lighted umbrella from Home Depot. It didn't come with a warranty or instructions and we found it odd that the lights would come on only when it was exposed to the sunlight. My husband removed the solar battery to clean the contacts and noticed that there was a tape that he needed to pull out. Hopefully, this will now make the umbrella light up in the evening. For those of you who purchased this and unhappy that it's not working, this may save you a trip back to the store.I'm giving it a 1 star rating because of the lack of information the manufacturer provides on the product."
1,It doesn't work,"My previous review was too hopeful. The lights do not work and never have. The manufacturer said to replace the battery (which we certainly never had the chance to drain in the first place) and we found that the battery costs upwards of $40. To replace a battery that we did not utilize at 1/3 the cost of the umbrella itself, out of our own pocket, is unseemly and we'll only pay around $20 to return it for a refund. Sad, really. I was excited at the prospect of the lights. The umbrella itself is nice, sturdy and appealing, but not for the cost it will end up for a feature that's not even guaranteed to work. Also, there is no warranty whatsoever so don't keep it for long. If it doesn't work right away, return it just as quickly in order to get any kind of refund. I do NOT recommend this product to anyone."
4,free trip to 1979,"All of these titles, although some are worn out in the listener's mind, will take one right to the backseat of the car on saturday night in the latter 1970s. They also may be good driving songs for the car. The only one missing is Bad Co shooting star."
3,Good Music,"The music was good and I do like this album however, I found volum one do be much better then this one. On this one there were many songs I had never heard before so I was a little disapointed."
1,~~~~~~BUYERS BEWARE~~~~~~~~,"Treadmill was great till it stopped working. The manufacturer has been back order on a part I need for 3 MONTHS!!! Week after week I was told the part was coming in. They could have replaced the entire display which was in stock but would not since it was $1000. So since they could not get a part I had to suffer. They would not even offer a discount of the part. They offered free shipping. WHOOPIE!Like I said... Great till it broke down!!!!And oh by the way, all they do for trouble shooting is make you buy parts and swap them out yourself. I am mechanically inclined so it was not a big deal for me."
3,Yea... 3 stars is about right,"First off, I've had this treadmill for about 2 1/2 years now, but I've been an everyday user for the last 8 months and lost about 35-40 pounds. I can give you an accurate review. PROS: Easy to use, sturdy frame, great customer service, good starter treadmill. CONS: Personally, I have issues with having to replace parts so soon(computer board twice) and its $280.00 now because my warranty expired, speed sensor, relay cord, the running belt isnt smooth after a year or so, cheap looking console.Its been a decent treadmill, and it would be a higher rating if not for the mechanical issues. If you are going to use this for more than 20-25 miles per week, spend a little more money and get a higher end treadmill. The warranty isnt long enough on the electronics if used daily. I'm going to upgrade to another treadmill the next time I need to make another expensive repair."
4,The tradmill is geat...,"I successfully completed the first week of running, no major problems - Squeaks while running at speeds greater than 5.8mph. I hope no other problems arise. Unfortunately, ABF promised to deliver the treadmill two days early but made me lose a whole day's pay. If you have a schedule with them don't assume they will call you. When I called around 3:30pm, I was scolded for not calling in the morning of the delivery date, and was told that I should wait for the driver to call me. Someone called around 6PM to inform me that my item will not be delivered. Fine. Unfortunately in the delivery tracker, it was reported that I was unavailable to receive the item, although I just wasted the whole day waiting for them... Just tell the truth, you couldn't deliver it due to transportation issues."
2,Bowflex Series 7 Treadmill,"The Bowflex we purchased 4 or 5 weeks ago has not been operable due to the machine sensor. Therefore, we can not rate this machine."
4,"Good product, poor delivery service","The treadmill is working and both my wife and I enjoy using it. It was delivered in a timely manner but the delivery folks simply left it out in the deck porch with the box all torn up from transport. There are a couple of small chipped plastic at the bottom of the treadmill that may not be there if the handling was better!This treadmill is a huge piece of exercise equipment and quite heavy but my wife and I we're able to take it inside and down to the basement slowly and very carefully. Assembly is simple enough and took me about 45 min. to put the whole thing together. Fit and finish of plastic components can be improved. So far no problem with the machine as far as function.The price is right for this treadmill and is a good value, but for any potential buyer, beware of the delivery people."
4,Great machine!,"I love this treadmill! It's a bit heavy to move around easily - but the extra weight is worth it as my husband (who is over 250lbs) can also run on it. There was a part missing (a piece of casing) but their customer service was extremely helpful, altho it did take about 3 weeks to arrive... but I understand, it was at Christmas!"
5,Treadmill Satisfaction,"The Bowflex Series 7 Treadmill is everything I expected it to be. I am very pleased with its performance and it is easily the equivalent of the best treadmills I have used in professional Helalth Spas. My only complaint is with the Amazon claim of free shipping. Be aware that one gets free shipping only if one manually selects it as part of the ordering process; i.e., don not ""oneclick"" order this item."
2,Would not buy another Bowflex series 7 again!,"I purchased this Bowflex Series 7 treadmill based on reviews in a consumer magazine. This treadmill worked fine for just under 2 years (although it developed some deck noise). Then it suffered a catastrophic break down (electrical and/or mechanical problems). Nautilus reps (the owners of Bowflex) sent repair guys to my house multiple times. The repair guys never got it running properly. After 6-8 months of hassle, I called 2 other independent repair companies, and they said it would be too expensive and difficult to fix (even Sears will not repair Bowflex treadmills). I am completely frustrated with the slow repair process, short warranty, and poor quality of this treadmill. I decided to buy a different treadmill at a similar price (a Sole F80, which I have also wrote a review of). I do not believe this product holds up well over time and, unfortunately, the warrantly only covers labor for 1 year! I would not buy another Bowflex treadmill again."
4,"A modern Southern Gothic tale, full of humor and pathos","About a third of the way through this book, you may feel as I did - is this a satire of Southern writing, or is it a genuinely bizarre story about a hapless last descendant of a town's mad family, Bobby Wayne Fontana? The story, set in Monroe, LA, combines Gothic elements of religion, fate, and human failings with a modern setting and a diverse cast of characters, including a Pakistani hotel owner, a naive and simple-minded young woman, and assorted Southern characters out of O'Connor, Faulkner, and the rest. The humor is present throughout, yet it's couched in a kind of pathos that can't help but strike a chord in the least of us who has ever felt at the hands of Fate. Though there are parts that go on a bit longer than they might, this is a fine example of modern Southern fiction. The new South has arrived."
5,"Happy as a clam, great value","I work in a hospital system, and most older computers did not have soundcards. When they switched to new computers, they got soundcard out slots, but I had no speakers to connect. With this speaker system, for 6 bucks, I was able to buy a set of speakers that are good sound quality for listening to internet radio at work, and cheap enough to leave behind and not care if someone steals them. Excellent Value.Specifications are: Color-Black shell/grey speaker coveror white shell/blue speaker cover (as shown)Power output 2w + 2W (RMS)Built in AmplifyerMagnetically shielded3"" full range driverFront Access Volume and Power on/off controlsStero headphone jackCompatible with all audio sources (computer, mp3, mac, pc,minidisc, Ect...)Frequency response: 120hz to 20khzDimensions (HxWxL): 7.08"" x 3.46"" x 3.66""Again well worth the 6 dollars. Between my brohter and I, we have bought 3 sets of these. A deal."
3,Not a toy,"I picked up one of these a couple weeks ago assuming that it was just a miniature Macross Valkyrie toy. It's not and if you plan on giving it to a young kid, they'll probably be disappointed. That being said, it's a nice display figurine that has all the articulation of Macross toys and can be displayed in either jet or robot mode. It comes with all the accessories and armor too and once you get past the somewhat awkward transformation it displays very well. If you want a toy, get one of the larger die-cast/plastic ones because these are pretty delicate and although they do transform, it's not something you would want to do on a regular basis. Thinking about getting a second one to display in jet mode."
1,Flimsy,"My son was excited until bits started falling off less than a minute after removal from the box. This toy was a big disappointment, especially considering the price."
3,NEIL YOUNG CRITICS: UNDER REVIEW,"I agree with a lot of other folks who say this dvd could have been awhole lot better.The comments by Mr Rogan,Mr Einarson & Mr Zimmer areespecially insightful but there is not enough footage from 66-75 that hasn'tbeen seen before.I thought there would have been more early CSNY stuff but there wasn't and The RUST NEVER SLEEPS clips were incongruous with the time frame listed in the title.If you are a Young Devotee, you have heard it all before anyway.The guy from the Village Voice has tunnel vision and Stephen Stills is NOT from New York City. A mediocre primer."
1,Zzzzz...poorly assembled,"I agree with the past couple reveiewers. I have been a hard core Neil Young fan for many years and this film served up little information that was new.Concert clips were interesting but far too short. I would love to see the complete source of some of these clips.And enough of Robert Christgau or ""Xgau"" as is he sometimes called or as he likes to self-proclaim himself ""The Dean of American Rock Critics"". ""An artist masturbating by a fireplace?""....what does that mean? How can a listener interpret these kinds of comments as relating to his listening experience?"
2,It was OK,"It wasn't that great of a DVD. I didn't like the females in there. It was ashame the girls didn't do much to entice the guys to really go wild. That is my major complaint... the guy's weren't wild enough. The only one in there I liked (sexually anyways) was the Lebanese-American guy, but he was the biggest (moreso where it counts) chicken of the group..."
1,What a disappointment,"I eagerly waited for this DVD to be released and I finally got it this morning. I found it poorly directed, edited, lighting was a big problem, the audio (or the lack of it), I found it tedious and very disappointing. Avoid it, it's not worth the $24 I paid for it. Can I have a refund?"
2,Not really worth it....except for the first guy,This video came and we immedietly threw it into the DVD player....the first featured boy is the dude from NY and he was certainly blessed. He was gorgeous and had the magic stick. It was all downhill after him.
2,Not so great for a pioneer,We have had every single CD changer out there. this one is the most expensive & by far the most lousy. It is EXTREMELY slow. It is also prone to missfeed discs & skip when playing my burnt CD's. We are so unhappy with our purchase.
1,Delivered Inoperable,"The PD-M426 did not play CDs without static, bounces & other noise.I initially thought it was the CD cartridge or CD. However; I have two of these units & the media tesed fine on my other unit."
1,Think twice before buying this,This is an old design (1997) the casset jammed up on my first play and after that it played one cd and from then on it only made weird noises. be advised to pass this one up. I sent it back.
3,Easy reader,I was looking for an easy reader version of this story. It is ok. The illustrations are a bit too cartoon-y but the text is good for beginning readers to practice with.
1,TextBook material - informal,"The style is good, content is overall comprehensive but the spice is missing.if you read for the chase, forget this one, if you are one of those who want to straighten the facts over a glass, you got the right book else don't think about this one."
2,Disappointing guide,Not very well presented. Not easy to read and find what you want...Just disappointing...
1,The shipment has not arrived,I have an opinion about the product simply because it did not arrive at my house. And the deadline for the day was up 9 / 7.
3,Pretty good read,I don't understand why I don't buy all of Hannah's books they are all so entertaining....this one is no different.The highlight of the book for me were the kids and the brothers!! The reason for my 3 stars is only due to the fact that no matter what the woman did for her man he continued to doubt her till close to the end! I understood where he was coming from but it did start to get a little tiresome. He was still lovable in his own way and the herione was amazing. A very good read!!!
3,Who was the most annoying?,"At the recommendation of my roommates, I felt I had to read ""Fishbowl."" Like in this novel, I live with 2 roommates. It was fun trying to decide which of us was Allie, Jodine, or Emma, but in the end I decided we all had bits and pieces of each girl in us. I have to admit though, for the most part, the characters were really annoying, but I just had to keep turning the pages to see who would be most annoying next! I don't feel that the plot was totally believable, such as how easily they raised the $10,000. Most people I know wouldn't pay $20 for a Halloween party at a bar, when they can go to another bar for free!! As for the seminar, those guys were pretty pathetic for paying $40 to listen to Emma talk for an hour. And the ending is way too predictable...of course they all forgive and forget and become friends in the end! Come on now..."
4,Great & Fast Read...,"A beach read indeed! This was a fast paced and very humorous story! The characters we all so different, and had to stick together to get through their problems. A great book with friendship, love and laughs. The ending was kinda blah... but definitely recommended!!"
3,it was okay.,"This book was actually one of the better chick lit books I read over the summer. I like how these three different girls came together, but other than that, I didn't find much of a plot to it. So, they get into an ""accident"" and they need to fix it. And over the book, we get to learn who these girls really are. But that's it."
4,Sarah does not disappoint!,"I felt that I could completely relate to this story even thought I've never had a roommate before. You can definitely see characteristics of your girlfriends in each of the characters. Mlynowski has developed well-rounded characters who come across as true-to-life, with all their flaws included."
2,Probably not worth the money,"I have owned this shredder for a year now and it has helped me along my path towards a paper-free home. However, I continuously am dealing with jams and today it finally jammed for the last time. Will be throwing it the dumpster and getting a new one that has a history of fewer jams."
1,"very hard to use, hard to clean","we hated this Shredder. it is very hard to use, hard to clean, very messy. How come a company designs a shredder and does not use it and test it properly.we ended up buying Amazon basics shredder and we love it."
2,A cynical attempt to cash in on popular characters.,"As a fan of the series, I wanted to like this movie. Sadly, character development is virtually non-existent, the dialog is clumsy, and the plot seems to have been lazily cobbled together from events and scenes that 'worked' in the series. Unfortunately, a scene or line or plot device relies on its integration into the larger work to be effective, and the movie as a whole simply isn't solid story-telling.Sometimes it works very well when a new creative team comes up with a different vision of characters (such as the superb dark, violent drama ofSamurai X - Trust & Betrayal (Director's Cut), which was produced after the much more mainstream/cartoonish Rurouni Kenshin TV series.) In this case it doesn't work; the movie lacks a lot of the things that made the series strong (such as good pacing and a strong musical score), but doesn't bring anything new of its own to the experience."
3,It is not bad.,"I ordered, and it arrived very fast. It looks pretty cool, and it has a long enough power cord to run it to the back seat of my car if I choose. Usually takes a good couple minutes to get my car comfortable enough to drive, and as long as I am not driving over an hour its fine. My feet started to get cold after about an hour, but everything from the waist up was comfortable enough to get me to the grocery store, gym, school etc. I wish the tacky pad it came with for installation was not so cheap, but other than that it is good for what you pay."
1,"big noise, no heat, useless",Made a lot of noise but could not generate enough heat to remove fog from a windshield let alone ice even when held right up to the windshield. The only heat that could be felt was if you held your hand 1/2 an inch directly in front of it and that was minimal at best. Bought this because the heater in my car had ceased working and to cope with the sudden freezing temperatures in Central California making it very difficult to get going in the early mornings. What little heat it throws is generated from a tiny light bulb. Very misleading. The 20% restocking fee (which should have been revealed up front but wasn't) and return postage made it not worth even returning. Would definitely not recommend it to anyone. Save your money and time.
3,Not hot enough,Really doesn't get hot enough to toast and heat effectively. Bottom element is not as hot as top and you end up turning it over to get a even brown to a sandwich.
4,Good quality at an affordable price.,"pros: excellent quality, affordable (at $ 37.00 without shipping), works wellcons: none so far (1 month from purchase)"
5,yum!,I got this for my folks and my mom can't say enough great things about it. I think they have panini sandwiches every day for lunch!
5,Makes a great sandwich,"So much better than the sandwich maker we had before.I got this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it.We use a little spray bottle of olive oil to grease the top and bottom.DON'T press down hard once the sandwich is in there, it's not necessary.The machine cooks well by just closing the top gently.My mom used it last time she was over and proceeded to buy one for herself.Verdict: buy"
5,Cuisinart GR-1 Griddler Panini and Sandwich Press,"Since purchasing this Panini grill, I can honestly say I cannot live without it!...This grill is used in our home on a daily basis to create the most wonderful, non greasy sandwich delights....there is no need to coat the bread with any type of oils to acheive wonderous results. The size of this grill is ideal, as storage and cleaning are a snap. Pair the grill with the book ""Simple Italian Sandwiches"", also purchased on Amazon at the same time, and you do it all....the combination is a must....5 stars"
5,Alotta Bang For Your Buck,"Makes any sandwhich, hero, wrap or bagel amazing. Much better than using a toaster. Sandwhiches really come out just like how they look in the picture. Only takes 5 minutes to pre heat machine (I usually just plug it in right before I make my sandwhich.) I bought one for my mom for her birthday and my entire family uses it(i hit 2 birds with one stone). You will never make a regular sandwhich again without using this machine. You dont have to go to a Panni place and waste money ever again. Everything tastes better hot,especially a cold cut sandwhich with melted cheese. I recommend this product to all of my friends. Makes a great gift, especially if the person you are giving it to lives in your home."
2,"Easy to use, but it's a burn trap","It makes great food and is simple to use and clean. But, it the device is poorly designed. When you press down on the handle it can cause the griddler to slide and/or tip easily, causing the hot grill lid to hit and burn your hand/fingers (this happened to me with 2nd use). It seems like the legs/base need to be wider with a different center of gravity to account for pressure being applied to the handle. also, the unit only has small rubber anti-slip circles in four locations on the legs/base that barely provide any meaningful traction on granite counters (presumably other counter materials too), which contributes to the tipping burn problem."
4,Great value,Works great..heats fast. Makes great sandwiches. Easy to clean so far. Would recommend to anyone.
4,Great sandwich maker,I would recommend this product to everyone. Easy to clean up and makes a multitude of sandwiches. Heats up quckly
1,"great for one use only, then you can toss it","Cuisinart GR-1 Griddler Panini and Sandwich PressI received this panini press as a gift and made panini sandwiches tasted pretty good, the problem came when it was time to clean this thing I have no idea how anyone can say its easy to clean its just like these terrible george foreman grills you can NEVER COMPLETELY CLEAN IT there is always some residue. I would throw this thing out rather than attempt to get this thing clean. reason im writing this review is I have received the GR-4 its the model that grills makes pancakes has detachable plates etc etc and Ive read the amazon reviews b4 I decide whether or not to keep it and eveyone says how easy it is to clean. You dont know who to trust but you can trust me when i say dont waste your money on this grill unless you have some unique ability to remove the tar like substance that build up on this oven. PEOPLE WHO ARE SAYING ITS EASY TO CLEAN MUST WORK FOR CUISINART!!!!"
1,Unnecessary Sticker,"Although the grill works just fine and I agree with other feedback about cooking with it, I am not giving this item a good rating simply because of the large, senseless sticker that the manufacturer adhered on the top surface of the grill. It was near impossible to pull off, and after working an hour at attempting to remove it, there is still significant glue left on the stainless surface. There is absolutely no reason for that sticker. It tells you nothing, and is only more advertising. If you choose to buy this, prepare yourself for a challenge. Get your Goo Be Gone out."
4,Great for sandwich making! Just one critique...,"Works great, looks great and heats up quickly and evenly. I just have one issue with it but its not enough to lower the review. This has no on or off switch so you plug it in to turn it on and that's it, no biggie. My only issue with that is that when you unplug it it makes these sporadic clicking sounds for up to 10 or 15 minutes after you unplug it. Barely noticeable but it will make you wonder if its really off and I find myself walking over to it every once in a while just in case when I hear the clicks. Just thought I would point that out."
2,Garbage,"I reserve 1 star rating for products that don't do what they are supposed to. This product does what it is supposed to- It looks good, price is reasonable, nice and compact, worked very well- BUT - not for very long. The non-stick on the plates lasted 2 months - and replacement plates cost just as much as the machine itself. I think it has alot to do with the sandwich pattern that it tried to press the bread into. It has lots of places where it can stick - Pam doesn't help and it makes the bread taste funny. Never mind the oozing mess that comes out of the whole machine as the stuff in the sandwich starts to melt. All in all .. good while it lasted. But not recommended. I bought the West Bend Panini press to replace this one. Its been 4 months - it's not attractive - but it does the job really well and it $50. I looked at the bigger machines - but the problem is - they are all BIG. And they have ""crinkle cut"" grills which are just as difficult to clean."
2,safety hazard,"No power switch. Also much smaller than expected. it gets the job done just fine.. but for the price, you're better off shopping around for a better item."
2,I think Ms. Muller needs to spend more time *in* the City...,"...doing research, and less time in the 'burbs, where she lives and writes.I used to be a big fan of her work, but this book is substandard for her, in my opinion. Non-locals might not know how off-base some of the material is, but she ought to know that many locals know better - so either she doesn't care, or she just doesn't know SF anymore herself.Perhaps her heroine should be operating out of Petaluma at this point - the books might seem more authentic that way."
3,Mass Production not served well with this compilation,"I discovered Mass Production in the summer of 1977. While the compilation has a few choice cuts from the band, there is a big black hole where their best stuff should have been on this CD. ""Believe"" and ""Three Miles High"" contain the best of Mass Production and no tracks from those two albums, their second and third album, are on Firecrackers. There is hope; look for a CD store, Aris out of Grand Rapids, MI. I am using their service to get those two albums burned to disc."
2,"Nice watch, horrible crystal","Had this for less than 6 months, wore quite sparingly. After not wearing for 3-4 days opened my watch drawer and the crystal essentially peeled off around perimeter. The crystal must be total junk. Now for a kicker, the crystal is not covered by ""lifetime warranty"" They want $30 + $9 return shipping to put another crystal in, which will not be warrantied either...Given the fact that other people are experiencing this, avoid, at least until quality of crystal improves."
1,Stylish Junk,"The first one went back because the crown was broken ( yes I know about the 1/4 counter turn as most watches in this class have that feature). The second one arrived fine; thank you Amazon. The crystal lasted three days before it cracked.( I work in an office ) It is plastic and you will realize that once you have a piece of it in your hand. It does not like cold though I suspect it would have cracked in any tempeture. The watch seems to be constructed very well other than this. NO ""crystal"" makes the watch functionless let alone High Performance. Titanium AND plastic...wow."
1,Cracked Crystal,I had this watch for 5 months and I was very pleased with it until I was sitting in a chair and heard a snap. I look down and the crystal has a big crack across the face. No impact...just a spontaneous crack. I searched the web and have found others with this same problem.
3,WARNING!! This Monkees CD may not be suitable for kids!,"The reason why is in ""Regional Girl"", the word that is also the name of a female dog in the song. And in ""Run Away From Life"" Davy sings the words ""making love"". If you hate their 60's music and like cuss music, get this,and don't let your kids listen to those 2 songs,""You and I"" isn't bad, but ""Admiral Mike"" is WORSE!"
2,Iffy,"I love The Monkees with all of my heart and it's great hearing them playing thier own intruments because they really are talented musicians, but I wasn't too moved by this album. Circle Sky was so much better on the Head soundtrack. They shouldn't have touched that one. Otherwise the album was pleasing, but not what I was hoping for. If your looking for an awesome CD, pick up Head or Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn and Jones Ltd. This album is only for the die hard fan."
5,soothe'n snuggle infant support,"The soothe'n snuggle infant support made by fisher price has discontinued this product and I wish they would bring it back. It is a wonderful infant insert for car seat, stroller or swing, & the vibrator calms fussy babies. Please bring back."
1,Interesting (at times) but not fun to read,"I am one of those who read Disgrace and went out to buy this book (without even bothering to read any of the reviews). Other reviews will give you a sense of the structure so I'll spare you the description of the book. While most (though by no means all) of the chapters/lectures were interesting and provoked thinking, I felt most went on for very long with unnecessarily academic (and often times bordering on the pretentious) language. This felt like a bunch of essays put together around a fictional character to make it a ""novel"" and it shows."
1,boring rambling,"Two big reasons I bought this book were ""Disgrace"" (a good Coetzee book that I read a few years ago) and the Nobel-Prize . This book turned out to be pure drivel. So much so that I gave up reading half way through. Many weeks later, I picked up the book again. I did finish it this time, but this is, absolutely, the most boring book I have ever read. It rambles on and on. Not to say that books that ramble are all boring or not good to read, but this one definitely is."
4,Fact or fiction?,"I honestly don't know. The press releases say Elizabeth Costello is a novel that pretends to be a biography, but many critics swear it's Coetzee's biography dressed up as fiction, even tho the protagonist is female while the author, of course, is a man. All I know is that it's a damn fine piece of writing.The setup is that Elizabeth Costelly, an Australian writer whose fame is based on an early piece of work about Ulysses' character, Molly Bloom, cleverly educates us to issues of race, honesty, humanitarianism, and deception in Africa through ""eight lessons"" which sometimes read like lectures or debates.It's not an easy book, and Coetzee's bleak outlook comes through in the writing, but it's worth the effort. It's a book I'll keep, as I believe I'll get even more out of it on a second reading."
5,It's finally here!! And worth the wait!!,"If you like Diamond Rio, then you are going to like this album. There is a great variety of music from balads that make you choke back tears (""We all fall down"" and ""I believe"") to more traditional country sounds (""Something cool"" and ""If you'd like some lovin'""). The song ""Beautiful Mess"" reminds me of a song from the band The Mavericks and its very catchy. ""Rural Philharmonic is also a signature Diamond Rio instrumental. I really like Diamond Rio because they seem to get better and better with each album they release. This album definitely stands up there with all their great albums such as ""One More Day"" and ""Love a Little Stronger""."
3,"safe for teens, garage or basements!","While the section on hockey strategies or systems leaves the reader debating the reality or existence of such concepts, the character developments practically turn the pages for you. The supporting characters like A. Murray are colorful and persuasive enough to get you to the end of each chapter, but fail to triumph when it really counts. I wonder if other characters could have been better, but then I attempt to find replacements, and I'm left saying meh."
3,Beautiful music... but...,"I respect all the musicians on this CD and have several other CD's of their work. That said, this austere and lugubrious disk is the epitome of ""Earlie Musike""... beautiful sounding, gorgeous music played with no mistakes. However.... where's the passion? Where's the *music* within the music??? This disc sounds like these accomplished musicians just got together to read some musical notes on paper. Without reading the translations, every song sounds the same..."
2,Not much help,"I was looking for a book with lots of information about symbols throughout art, this book is not the answer for that. This is more of a list of objects that are poorly put together and lack any great description. If you're looking for symbolism in art information this is not the book. actually I'm still looking for that book out there...But in the mean time don't waste your time and money on this one."
2,"Animation spotty, Dialog always suffered...Story fair.","I've seen some great Japanese Anime. This wasn't it.The animation was in places Poor, Acceptable and Superior. Spotty animation quality is a real shame. The dialog or delivery was just passable. The storyline wasn't convincing. If you have to own every Japanese Anime you can find then by all means, get this one. Otherwise get Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke before you purchase this one."
1,very underwhelming,"I got on an anime kick after seeing the Ghost In The Shell movies (first one is promising, second one is excellent). Appleseed doesn't stand up in terms of artwork or storytelling. The characters' personalities and physical movements are both painfully wooden. The storyline struck me as pretty stupid too, but I'd probably have liked it more as a teenager. I sat through the whole thing, but only just."
5,DVD,What can I say about this DVD...AWESOME FLICK if you like this kind of stuff and I really do. The anime is sooo incredible. Just can't get enough. Arrived early and in great shape....thanks for the great a great movie
3,Excellent Animation!!! Story needs work.,"This review is not based on the DVD. I saw this movie in an advance screening in NYC. The animation is top notch. It's the best eye candy I have seen since Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust, Last Exile and Blood the last vampire to name a few. The animation in this film has set the new standard for any future anime to follow hands down. However, the story was a bit weak and at times a bit cheezy. It was intresting enough but not truly captivating. It's main point was the CGI. Truly art in motion. I give it three stars for it's story which could have used some brushing up but 10 stars for for the CGI!! Totaly sweet!!!A side note, I would like too see the Art team for Appleseed 2004 and the creative team for Last Exile to team up. I think they would create an anime for all time."
2,"Great backgrounds, extremely uninspired character designs","There are some very nice CGI backgrounds in this movie and the mechanical visuals are good too, but the human character designs are very bland and uninspired. Perhaps this kind of high tech backgrounds and lazy character design are the future of modern anime? This would make it much like Vexille, although Vexille's character design's are a little better - although I don't like Vexille's use of the lazy man's form of anime, ie: paint over motion capture with pastel-like human faces. The story here is nothing special."
5,Amazing!,"Honestly.. I've read the other reviews and i agree with most of them except the ones that complain about the animations. This was a great movie in my opinion and I know that the animation wasn't perfect, but compared to alot of others it was spectacular and I suggest this film to anyone that enjoys anime. SEE IT!"
3,The animation was very good!,"I hated the lame story plot mostly, the plot lacked any true hero or heros. Just a bunch of Lambs lead to slaugther. The only winner was a blood sucking monster which was allowed to live. LAME!"
2,What can i say,"Its not the seller i dont like, its the fact that BCC said to get the book but the prof is not using it. The book is clear cut and easy to read, just i ant using it really for BCC class"
1,"Just a smart card ""holder"" not a reader","Be careful, this is just a ""Smart Card Holder"" not a reader. It means that this devise is intended to be used with some Fujitsu laptop model which has a built-in smart card reader and only need the card holder which can be a PCMCIA devise (like this) or an USB devise. It will not work with other laptop computers without a built-in reader. Check the compatibility list in Fujitsu web site."
3,A Gritty Tale About Thai Town Los Angeles,"Province 77 is the nickname given to the area of Los Angeles known as Thai Town, in the eastern part of Hollywood. It follows the story of a young man, Pat, whose family owns a restaurant, but likes the life of fast cars and women. He gets caught up with a local gangster and moves up the ranks. Meanwhile, the family hires a drifter who stays in the same apartment building the family lives in. The family wants Pat to get away from gang life. Which path will Pat choose - what connection does the drifter have? This is a good movie that touches upon several issues. One is the conflict of the immigrants trying to maintain some traditions of the old country, yet the children are fully Americanized. Another is the attraction of fast money and life in an urban environment."
2,Two design flaws,"Great idea but two flaws: (1) if you cook something greasy, when you open it the grease drips off the top plate and onto the counter; (2) the ""mobile"" grease collector cup is easy to bump and spill since it is not attached (would it have been so hard to just have a small clip or ledge to hook it to the grill?) Cleaning is not that easy either. All in all, it's one of those things that might have enough ""issues"" that it remains in the cabinet/garage unused rather than becoming a regular appliance."
4,cooks like a dream; cleans like a nightmare!,"The Griddler cooks like a dream. It's fast!! I've tried hamburgers, chicken, fajitas and they all came out really well. I'm looking foward to trying paninis next. The only problem is cleaning the unit. It takes longer to clean than to cook most items. I have figured out that if you spray water on the plates once it has cooled it cleans much easier but you still have to methodically clean each groove in the grill and then when you clean down the drip trough you have to reclean the grooves. I'm considering changing over to the new George Foreman grill just to be able to remove the plates and put them in the dishwasher."
3,A fair price...,"Very easy instalation!!It's a good first web cam, but a 1.3 Mpixel could be a better choice."
5,Very helpful,"How to Make Sewing Pattern , is a good book that everyone working in producing garment should have. Personnaly, being a man's taylor, i found a bit to shortcoming in treating the technic on how to draw a man jacket pattern using specific measurements, especially regardind the sleeve and harmhole part.I would like other reviewrs to inform me if there is others books on the market treating the same sujet but more step to step on how to draw."
2,A waste of time and money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book was pointless: it teaches you how to self measure which was great, but then you take a bunch of measurements only to wind up with a great big square block of drafted ""patterns"" that require TONS of altering and fitting...this is not what i bought this book for. I wanted to be able to draft patterns, alter them minorly, and be able to make clothes from them. I've already spent endless hours shaping big pieces of square fabric into patterns and thought that this book would save me some time from doing that, but esentially, it doesn't...I was still screwing around with big pieces of fabric darting them everywhere in order to make them fit even AFTER I was done drafting the slopers in this book.....it's just not worth it...."
5,Track List,Cattle Call - Good Life / Broken White Records / 1999 / /Track list:1) Log Trucks and Snowmobile Trails (3:09)2) This Time Around (5:14)3) Drown (3:11)4) November Skies (4:18)5) There is a Light ( real audio ) (4:07)6) Change (4:10)7) To Old to Ramble (4:29)8) Mention Your Name (3:19)9) Yippee Yi Yeah (3:06)10) The Champagne Song (5:26)11) Must Have Been Rain (3:54)
1,this product sucks,"this product is bright, thats about the only good thing. very limited range, you have to walk up close to it like withinin few feet for it to work, does not work as advertise, has very weak horizontal angle detection. it suck up battery like theres no tomorrow, the batteries only last like a month or two. again the range of detection is extremely poor. there are better products out there."
4,Its a battery powered motion sensing night light.,"There are three models of motion sensing night light made by maxxima. They contain one, two or three LEDs. This is the model with the most light output with 3 LEDs. The light is a bluish color. Its about as bright a regular night light. This model does not plug into the wall. Its only battery powered. It uses 4AA batteries. The motion sensor coverage is ok, but not great."
1,poor,"Be careful!!!!! The picture next to the price is not the kit you are buying, part # otc 6488 is the kit you will be getting and otc 6489 is what they are showing. When you call customer service to ask about the picture and kit being different all you will hear and I quote ""I don't care."" I will never buy anything from Amazon and/or Tool source ever again, and would advise you to be careful."
5,A-plus!,"This one was just what the doctor ordered, just as the caption below the pic promised, got it right on time and all!"
5,Does somebody have a record player back there?,"I'd never think in a million years I could hear these songs in of all places, London! It was in a beautiful small Italian resturant and as soon as I heard Angelina, I was in Italian heaven on earth. I almost started to cry since it's been years (don't ask how many) and I'm sitting there eating a beautiful meal, with a beautiful wife and listening to old beautiful Italian classics. To all kids out there, I'm going to set an example and be extra good (if it's not too late) so maybe I'll see this CD under my Christmas tree this year! A great CD to own if you have at least one drop of Italian blood in you. A great gift."
3,Not Italian... ok but not that great,"Based on those other reviews, I bought this CD. And well.. I guess I expected more. So listen closely to the clips before you buy this CD. I won't be returning it but I don't think I'll be listening to it all that much either."
4,Outstanding,"The CD is awesome. I have ""The Mirror Conspiracy"" as well. ""The Cosmic Game"" is the one I just bought. It groves very well, its a great CD for the car ride home from a hard days work. As well as a great soundtrack for a clam dinner party with friends. If you like Thievery Corporation, this album is a must have."
5,Peace at last!,I bought this for my sister who's a crackberry addict. Her phone would constantly dial me while bouncing around in her purse. She loves this cover as she no longer bothers folks this way and it protects her prized blackberry and conserves power in sleep mode.
2,Not really designed for the investor,"The title of this book is mis-leading and the author missed a golden opportunity to write a book that truly is a self-study guide to interpreting and analyzing financial statements. This book appears to be written by an accountant for accountants - it goes into excessive detail without ever addressing the needs that an investor has. I was looking for a relatively simple, straightforward book that addresses stock selection on the basis of information gleaned from financial statements. This book claims on its back cover to ""show stock market investors how to profit from the knowledge of professionals,... "" It doesn't do that. It goes into endless, minute detail about statements but never relates it to stock selection. I feel ripped-off."
1,AUDIO,"NEW El 7 Machos (DVD)The audio is TERRIBLE, WE CANT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING!! THE PERSON IS RESPONSIBLE, WE RECIVED THE MOVIE ON TIME"
4,Sounds great,Very good. They sound good and the installation materials are good. They are much better than the larger speakers I bought. Sadly the larger speakers I bought were also pioneer. Not sure why the quality is off for the larger ones. Only drawback is that these speakers do not have grilles.
5,Exciting History of Diving,"A very interesting book about the military origins of diving, and the heroic actions of the UDT (Underwater Demolition Teams) who were the precursor to today's Navy SEALS.If you want to learn about how it all began this is a great place to start.A highly recommended peak into the actions of men who had more guts than glory.Paul Mila[...]"
4,Great re-hash of a solid VU album,"It's so good to hear the full version of ""Sweet Jane"", the ""heavenly wine and roses"" part that you can hear on ""1969 Live"" but not on the original ""Loaded"" sounds super here. I can't imagine why it was left off the original. Also on this album is one of the best versions of ""Ocean"" that I've heard (the one on disc 1). There's a 12-string sounding riff in there that isn't on any of the other versions, and it really makes the track bristle with menace. It's only about four notes, but they are among the most effective four notes that I've ever heard come out of an electric guitar."
5,A new age masterpiece before the time of new age music.,"Train Round the Bend sounds like it belongs on Velvet Underground's earlier albums, but there's no denying that it defines their sound. When I first heard New Age, I hated it. But after listening to the album straight through a number of times, it grew on me and I realized that what we experience and take for granted now was revolutionary back then. This album is a classic and I recommend adding it your collection. I'm telling you, man-this music will blow your mind."
5,""" A Must have for your Dennis Brown collection","This is a must have for any Dennis Brown lovers..This is a collection of ""The Crown Prince of Reggaes"" best work."
4,Adrenal Fatigue Relief,"For anyone suffering with adrenal fatigue, DHEA is a good supplement to take. These are very small pills, easily swallowed, and they can truly make a difference in your energy level day to day."
4,Prince gets back to the goods....,"So after releasing a string of horrible albums, The Artist Formerly Known As Prince has given us something decent to listen to again. ""The Greatest Romance Ever Sold"" is a harmless little number that's never going to stick out in anyone's mind as the greatest ""Prince"" song ever, but it's a good one nonetheless. Most of the remixes on here are of a rap or R&B influence, hence guest stars such as Eve and Q-Tip, and you also get a disco-influenced remix done here by Jason Nevins (remixes for Janet Jackson, The B-52's and Run-DMC), which is my personal favorite. Upon first listen, I was not too impressed, but listen to this one a couple of times and you'll be hooked."
5,The most beautiful song in the world,"Fell in love with this song the first time i heard it, I can't stop playing it. The lyrics the music and ohhh that voice, trust prince to come up with a brilliant song. The remixes are good but the original is the best, the video is good too."
5,Great cardstock for postcards!,"This 90 lb. card stock is great for postcards. It prints well on a laser printer, and meets USPS specs for postcards. (Note: I gave this same review for the pastel-blue 90 lb. card stock.)"
2,Tons of mistakes and grammatical errors,Not nearly as good as ICRC. I agree with the other reviewer that there seems to have been no editor.
2,visually dull,"The concert and videos are not visually appealing for the young ones. The image quality and footage of concert is a VERY small step above amateur. If your child is a fan of the colorful Dan Zanes videos on TV, this video is not the same."
5,The Blessed One,"The musical genius of Ian Anderson shines through this album. Just hear the theme [first few notes] of the title song... as sweet as 'Sweet Little Tune' in 'Minstrel in the Gallery'. The songs are classics - there's more you can grasp each time you hear this music. 'Postcard Day' is immediately appealing. Ian Anderson is really a Blessed One! You can hear Real Audio versions of all the songs on the Jethro Tull home page. Let me warn you, this will set up a yearning to hear them properly on the CD!"
3,NOT AS THRILLING AS I HAD HOPED,"Well, I hate to say it, but I just can't find it in myself to gush about this CD like everyone else has. I don't think it comes close to having the magic of Passion Play, Minstrel in the Gallery, or Songs From the Wood. I can stick one of those CDs in my player, hit repeat, and happily listen all day. This one gets tiresome after a couple of replays."
2,Not as good as expected,"Looks like most of these reviewers would give a 5 star rating to Ian regardless of what he did. I am a fan of Ian's and have been for years, however, this effort seemed lacking to me. Seems he couldn't decide whether to just do acoustic solo, or full band solo, and landed in the middle somewhere. Beyond that, the melodies are not catchy, or captivating, or musically interesting. I did like Dot Com, but, do not like this. And another version of ""Thick as a Brick""? What a strange choice. Why not some other song, an acoustic version of ""Farm on the Freeway"", or ""Jump Start"", something like that. Overall, not worth buying."
4,Well worth the read,"I would recommend this book, especially to those who like Nance's books. If you like some technology mixed un with your suspense, then this is the book for you. The only reason I gave it an 8 was because there were numerous flashbacks that dragged the story down. (although they were good for character developement)"
3,Too short,"And few things new, really. If you're a die-hard fan you'll find this not so exciting and refreshing; but -on the contrary- if you're a newie, this will put you on the right track to know the geniuses behind the extra-awesome music you hear all time and that made you crave for more! ;-)"
3,Slide is Slave's best song.,"Slave was one of the first truly funk laden bands that signaled the transition from disco to the deep bass of Funk's late 70's hey day. Slide is in its original form on this album, (the radio cuts always ended too early) This was also the days when one or two hits were all an album needed, so dont look for much else. But for me, ""Slide"" was enough."
5,Really liking this series...funny stuff!,"For the past few years I've gotten into several series. Two were 'romantic' which is not really what I'd normally like. One got too weird, too 'adult' and too pagan! So, I quit.I decided to give this a try and so far I've liked them all. They crack me up! Only problem is they end... :)"
2,NOTHING NEW. The same old same old.,"This my second Evanovich and it got old real quick. Stephanie continues to stumble & fall. She never learns from her mistakes consequently the story is repetitious & boring. Something like ""The Three Stooges"" She is like her hamster Rex, endlessly running around his wheel."
2,Text is Great the Reader is AWFUL!,"Janet Evanovich's Three to Get Deadly is a great read but a terrible ""listen"". Lori Petty's ultra-nasal delivery was too much to bear. I've previously listened to both C.J. Critt and Lorelei King narrate LE's books with pleasure.Don't waste your time on this one. I dumped this audio cassette and read the book instead."
5,Can't say enough good things about the Stephanie Plum series,Janet Evanovich is an awesome writer. I love the way she makes her characters so real. It makes me want to head to New Jersey and hang out and maybe meet Ranger and Morelli and Lula and Connie and of course Grandma Mazur. (hee-hee) The Stephanie Plum series is LOL awesome!
4,More Plum Fun,"Janet Evanovich's writing is fresh, funny, and suspenseful. Stephanie Plum is believable partly because she doesn't take herself too seriously. Her loony family somehow escapes being two-dimensional despite the spoof factor, and the story lines are full of danger. This is a new kind of thriller."
5,love this series,"i love janet evanovich's series. i read the first book and hooked now. i love mysteries- and this one has mystery, (some sexual tensions) and very comical. love these books."
3,Not Bad but ther are better,"Janet Evanovich's novel Three To Get Deadly is so light and frothy (aka unsubstantial) I practically forgot about before I finished reading it. I got a few laughs from Lula but her main character is too incompetent and inane to be funny. Joan Hesse, Gillian Roberts and Sharon McCrumb are much funnier and have other delights as well ie. poignant insights, reasoning ability etc. I might read another one of these if I'm in deperate need of total fantasy but she is not the best at what she does. This book is readable but ultimately it's just another throwaway."
2,Deficient in important information,"On the positive side, the book is neat and is written with humor. Unfortunately the negatives outweigh the positives. When reading this book, I found that most of the information covers resume writing and how to make contact with pharmaceutical sales reps. I think some of her advice about making contact could prevent you from ever getting a job in pharmaceutical sales because it is so unprofessional. The ""how to actually get the job part,"" the interview, was seriously deficient in information. There were few questions and few answers, and next to nothing about how to prepare for the interview. This one simply does not deliver on the description of the book given."
