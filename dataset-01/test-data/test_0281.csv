1,poor build quality,These headphones had amazing sound and fit so comfortably. The reason I gave them one star is that they broke after about only 2 months of daily use. The build quality on them was horrible.
5,WELL DONE,"I didn't think it was possible to find a pair of headphones for this cheap that performs so well...... V-MODA has made a great product. Not only is the sound excellent, but these earbuds are comfortable. I'd recommend them to anyone who is looking for headphones under $40."
5,Cure for the Common iPod,"The problem with most portable mp3 players is the lack of bass. The v-moda bass freq earbuds are especially nice for acoustic or older [e.g. Beatles] and low bit rate tracks that never quite sound right on a portable device. The sound is not as bright as most standard earphones but the v-modas seem slightly more efficient [less volume level to achieve the same db.] The crisp bass scales nicely with the volume increase. Yes, you need to use your equalizer to get the best sound. The three different size silicone ear inserts are a must for the big bell curve of humanity. The cord is only about 45 inches long and the included modawrap is made of a nice pliable rubber. An inexpensive solution to the problem of muddy or nonexistent bass."
1,big disappointment,after i got my headphones in the mail i tried them out and i was disappointed by the poor quality of sound. i had bought $3 earphones from a retail store a few months earlier that had better sound quality. but thats not the worst part. after about 10 uses the left ear bud completely died.i would give this a 0 star rating for how bad i got ripped off but i cant. im here to try to stop other customers from getting screwed like i did.
2,They Break,I bought one for myself and one for my girlfriend. Both are broken within 2 months. The left ear went out on mine and the casing came apart on my girlfriend's set.
4,Product Quality Issues?,"Headphones sound great and are great value when compared to other brands. Unfortunately, the stem of the 1/8"" headphone jack broke off after only 3 months of infrequent, light use."
2,Sorry! Not for me.,This is my second purchase of In-ear-headphones. I have a hearing problem and find buds more comfortable than the standard head phone but the soundwith these to me is close to nothing. The first ones are OK. I checked these against all the headphones I have and I suppose that is just the way theyare. Price was OK and that is about all.Reviews on Amazon were a little mixed on these.
2,Not kidding: Different colors sound different!,"I wouldn't have believed it, but I just ordered three different colors, and the difference in sound quality is incredible. The ""rouge"" sound amazing, but the ""rocker red"" and ""jungle green"" sound terrible with absolutely no bass. I am aware that fit matters a lot, and they all fit the same. But they don't sound the same at all. I guess I'm happy that I bought 5 pairs of Rouge and only 1 of the other two! By they way, I know they are authentic because I bought them all directly from v-moda."
2,Do not buy these earphones,"I have purchased two of these earphones and i now know that the earphones are not very durable. the first pair i purchased lasted me only 2 months and when they broke i happen to have just bought a new iPhone so i used those earphones and after a couple of months, I decided i needed a higher quality of earphones so I went back to V-moda because they sound pretty good for the price. After only 1 week of having the earphones stop working in one ear. i am currently in the process of exchanging them."
3,Ok for the price,"If you've never owned quality earbuds, these will seem like they are pretty darn good. However, I've already been spoiled by a good pair of Ultimate Ears buds. Unfortunately those were accidentally damaged, so being without any kind of phones for my MP3 player, I picked up these Vmodas.Let me just say that I REALLY miss my Ultimate Ears buds. These VMODAS do have pretty good bass, but everything else is muddy in my opinion. They actually sound pretty good for Rap and electronic stuff like Crystal Method. But for any kind of rock and roll, Classical, Blues etc. they don't cut it at all. I would have to rate them mediocre overall. I would have given them a 2 if it weren't for the price. At 29.99, I didn't want to be overly critical.If you really care about sound quality, and have the money, get yourself a good quality pair of buds. Otherwise, these should do I guess."
3,Not as good as everyone says,I liked these headphones but they do not come close to my nice cans. The sound tends to fluctuate and have WAY to much bass. Do not get these as cans replacements.
1,Decent Sound But Not Well Built,"I got a new pair of these about 3 weeks ago and they broke last night. After three uses (about 2 hours of listening to my iPod) the right earbud quit working. I thought maybe there was something wrong with my iPod so I grabbed another set of headphones and they worked without any problems. I am not sure why they quit working, but it wasn't because I abused them, I take good care of all of my electronic gear.The sound of the earbuds was slightly above average, though they had a little too much bass for my taste. I did like the way they fit in my ears and they did not fall out like others I have tried.I can't really recommend these to anyone because they did not last, but then again maybe I just got a bad pair."
1,Stopped Working in Two Months,"They were ok - not great - for the two months that they worked, but then one of the buds stopped working. So, obviously, they're now useless to me."
1,Avoid these headphones,"These headphones perfectly recreate the sound of music playing through a dorm room wall. If you like that sound, you'll love these headphones. How do these headphones achieve ""bass""? By cutting the treble and midrange to muffled insignificance. Also, you'll enjoy the crinkly saran wrap sound of the speaker diaphragm going back and forth as you insert them in your ear."
4,"Where were you about 50 bucks, 2 months and 4 skullcandy headsets ago????","Where were U about 75 bucks, 2 months,4 skullcandy headsets and alot of frustration ago???? So far im really feeling this product. The only thing is, the cord is a little short 4 my taste, and it doesnt have the in line volume control. But I can live without that since i now have the sound quality that i was searching 4.. And 4 a ""Sweet"" price 2 .. Now its only a matter of the ""test of time"" 2 C how long these bad boys hold out B 4 they need 2 B replaced..;^)"
3,Broken,"I have to say that I was waiting to them to break before I wrote a review, and they did. As soon as you get them, you realize the wire feels flimsy and 'plasticky'. But it wasn't the wire that broke, the right earbud stopped playing anything. Soo, either I stepped on it or something or it just doesn't want to play, and I don't want to open it to make it worse.They sound great, though. So be careful with them."
1,Poor build quality,"These earphones broke within a month. Too bad, because the sound quality was pretty good."
3,Best sound but so fragile,I love the sound these little ear buds put out. But they are so fragile. This was my second pair. Short out after three weeks. I admit I used them every work day. But come on. I didn't realize that If I bought these headphones I would have to go inside my plastic bubble to use them.
2,Just another pair of cheap headphones,"Garbage, garbage, garbage. The left earbud stopped working a month after I got them. Even before they stopped working, they were mediocre quality. Too much bass and not very comfortable. Save your money and go with something else."
1,Freaky ( how little ) Bass ( there is ),"I auditioned about 10 tracks thinking the Bass line just had not kicked in yet...If you don't mind having this things jammed all the way in your ear canal to get a very trivial amount of bass ( which is more the air not being able to exit your ear which I think is dangerous ) these are for you! The back of the package says something to the effect of "" sounds like club quality ."" I'm sorry but that is just not the case. Stay clear.I jumped on these due to the overwhelming reviews with high rankings.I was seriously disappointed."
3,"Too much bass, not enough highs","I got this pair because the ratings were decent for the price and my $20 pair from Sony broke on the right earbud.The comfort of this pair is much better than my old pair, and really good overall. Also, the construction quality seems maybe slightly above par for this price.The sound quality lacks though. Too much bass. Don't get me wrong, I like bass, but only where it belongs in a song. This set makes everything sounds bassy.. and it lacks highs and mids. If you like extra bass everywhere.. sure go for it.. but otherwise, go for something else."
3,I used to love these. . .,"I had these headphones for about 4 months and I LOVED them. It was the best pair of relatively cheap headphones I've had, and I've tried at least 7 types. The sound was amazing with great bass and sound isolation. They were cute and they worked great.Today the right ear fizzed out followed quickly by the left one. Maybe I was a little too rough on them, but any earphones should be up to a little wear and tear. Perhaps next time I'll try investing in a higher quality pair."
3,Sounded Great While They Worked,"They truly do have great sound if you are fond of the lows freq. in audio. Only complaint I have is I bought mine May 28, 2008 and noticed yesterday Aug 20, 2008 the left bud stopped working. That's not even 3 months and I have been taking extra care with them."
2,Great.....when they work,"Pros: Great bass response for earbuds.Cons: Stopped working after 3 months. Would have to giggle where the connector met the cord to get some sound. Once the cord moved again, the sound would cut out. Supposedly this is an issue with many of the V-Moda earbuds."
2,durability in question,i bought this about 6 months ago and it worked perfectly. the sound is clear and the bass is deep. but everything went out the window when the left ear bud broke. sounds keeps on cutting in and out. it could be just my luck that i got the 1 pair that didn't work after 6 months of infrequent use but that is not the case. i bought these for my brothers and they both experience the same problem: the left ear bud also stopped working. if this happened to all 3 of us than it must not be just our luck; it's the company's.what i suggest is to look at some other set of ear bud...
2,"Poor Quality, Sounds Great!","These are admittedly the best earbuds I have listened to. However the quality of the speaker cable is so low, these things will only last a couple months of regular use. I maybe wear them 100 times before they're done.I would pay $100 for these with a quality chord, but that day probably won't ever come."
4,too loud,"bass is amplified a tremendous amount. too bass heavy. good sound if you turn them up but they can damage your ears, they are very loud!!!! the highs are weak."
4,bright but not quite duable,"I like the earbuds so much that I replace my previous original IPOD earbuds. Its pink color bright up my spirit easily. Sound quality is decent too. Two cons:1. the silcon parts sometimes fall off, tough to find them.2. after half a year since I used it, one earbud does not sound any more. :("
3,A Bass-ic Earbud.,"I bought these to compare to my Senheiser MPX70 Sport Neckband headphones, which have served me well, but are a little light on bass. The V-Moda Bass Freq Earbuds do in fact have deeper bass, but the rest of the sonic spectrum is quite lacking. The mids and highs are somewhat muddled and fuzzy, especially compared to the Senheisers. I bought the Seinheisers on sale for $20 regularly $55, and the V-Modas also for $20. But the clarity and well rounded fullness of the Senheisers blows the V-Modas away. If you have damaged eardrums and are incapable of appreciating the mid and upper frequencies then you might be happy with these."
2,Terrible Product,The headset only lasted me one week before one of the ear pieces broke. Cheaply made and I don't recomend this product.
2,Good sound but......,These earbuds have great sound but.... unfortunately they are not very dependable. I have already gone thru two sets with the same issue. One of the buds stops working. The sound only comes thru one ear. Now I would expect this if they are treated rough but I was very careful with both sets. For the same issue to happen with both sets would mean there is a flaw in the design. If they continued to work these would be a 5 star rating.
4,good sound,"Good sound for the price. Fit is important, especially for flights or riding a bike. The thin cord tangles easily though...."
2,Great sound but bad quality,"I read the reviews before I bought these headphones and I noticed a lot of people saying they broke easily. I figured I would give them a try anyway. Sure enough about a month later the left earbud came apart. So while they're cheap, they're poorly made."
3,Lotsa Bass,"These headphones boost the bass, at the expense of the high frequencies. You need to compensate for them with parametric eq if you have it (ipods don't). Even the ""boost highs"" setting on my ipod doesn't correct for this. Given you can get over that, they are ok for casual listening, and have excellent fit and block the outside noise very well."
5,HAHAH!! Blew my mind! Awesome headphones,"Im not an audiophile or wtvr they call themselves. I DO LOVE music and I needed a replacement set of headphones and was on a budget this week so I got these. I read tons of reviews for many in-the-ear pieces and I decided to get these. On its sight I looked at all the colors and saw how they vary from $8 - $40 DEPENDING on the COLOR! So I like red, theirs is a little too much red now that I got it but wtvr. And since Christmas is coming I bought 4 total, for my kids as stocking stuffers. Well I put them in and WOW! Best headphones Ive had! Bass is tremendous I had to put on Electronic audio setting and its perfect. Im so happy with my purchase! These are gonna be in my ears for hours today and in the future.I am buying a spare because the wires are really frail looking, skinny. And I dont want to go without a pair again. Def will buy Vmoda again. AMAZING sound and for the price! Cant beat it"
2,They don't produce much bass as before,"i have used v-moda earphones for years because of the price and clarity and bass it produced. and each time i buy new pair it seems they reduce the bass and clarity each time. Im dissapointed, this will be my last pair ill buy from them, because now i have to experiment around with other brand of earphones."
5,Best IEMs on the market for anywhere near that price!,"I am very happy with these earphones. For the price, these IEMs (Inner Ear Monitors) have the best sound quality on the market. Tight bass, rich mids, crisp undistorted highs. They also have a higher volume capacity than most. Incredibly comfortable. They just fit into my ears like they were molded from my ear canal. And aesthetically they are very pleasing, not that that matters. My one complaint is that they have a ""Y shaped"" or symmetrical cord, which I don't like. It seems that many people don't understand why some headphones have an asymmetrical cord. The asymmetrical cord allows you to put one speaker in your ear then wrap the cord behind your neck and into the other ear. Its not so two people can listen at the same time or any such nonsense that I've heard people speculate about. Also, noise isolation is superb. If your budget is anywhere below sixty dollars get these!!!!!"
5,"Great value, very small, tons of bass.","For the price, these are great headphones - too much bass, but you can probably fix with with a bit of EQ tweaking on your player. I don't find them to be uncomfortable even after a couple of hours of wearing them.If mine were lost or damaged etc. I would definitely replace them with the exact same thing."
2,great sound... not worth the $,sounded great and looked pretty cool. however they only lasted me about a month of consistent use... Maybe it's me but I have had $5 pairs last longer. Something to think about
3,Great sound as long as they last,"I bought these for my iPod Touch in late Feb. 2008. They had a break-in period of a couple of weeks and then the sound improved. Unfortunately, the sound from one of the two sides died a few months later, and when I tried to contact the V-Moda website for warranty information and to replace them, I got no response despite several tries.So, the sound is great. Much better, in my opinion, than the Bose Tri-ports that I use now (got those with points from my credit card), and much better fitting than the Bose Tri-ports also, besides being much less expensive.I would recommend these earbuds but for the terrible (non-existent) customer service from V-Moda."
2,Where's the treble,"I found these headphones to be comfortable enough but the sound quality lacking. To me they present muffled sound reproduction with the treble and midrange severely lacking. I experimented with very high bit rate MP3 sources (320 kbps) from a MP3 player and CD playback from a Sony portable CD player. I also tried moving the buds around in the ear canal with my hands but could not get the highs to emerge. I can't understand the positive reviews, maybe I got a bad set. Sure wish I could still get the Sony MDR-A30G headphones as I was very happy with them for years until I broke them. Guess I'll keep looking for something."
2,Far from what I expected...,"I wanted to replace the headphones that came with my iPod so I decided to try these thinking they would be an improvement(sound quality). I've read pretty good reviews so I figured why not. Unfortunately I was pretty disappointed in their overall sound quality. The headphones that came with my iPod sounded way better than these. Yes, the bass response was slightly better but I went back to the ones that came with my iPod. I'm pretty picky when it comes to sound quality so I make sure the songs I load onto my iPod are high quality. If you're like me I wouldn't waste your $ on these."
2,O.K. Would not recommend. They fall out too easily.,These are not very good. I don't like how they fall of my ears so easily. I have to keep pushing them back in and the sound quality is comprimised.
4,good for thhe price,I'm no audiophile but did get a fuller sound than with i-pod 2nd gen ear buds. Would prefer for listening to music. Will take some getting used to the noise cancelling ear canal fit. Not sure if this is where the richer sound comes from or not but no disappointment at this price level.
5,Best sound for the money,"I kept hearing these mentioned as the ""Editor's Choice"" and finally got a pair for my iPod. They are truly the best sounding ear buds for the money that you spend. The bass is very rich and deep without distortion, which is surprising in a pair of ear buds. They come with different size ear plugs too. When you have the right size in, all of the other environmental noises are drowned out so all you hear is the audio. I am truly impressed.If I had to say one thing bad about them it is that the wires seem a little thin and could be an issue after using them for a while, depending on how they are take care of.Overall these are the best sounding ear buds I have owned and at only $20.00 you can't go wrong."
4,Good addition to my mp3 player,Excellent sound with good bass response. Very comfortable fit in the ear. It came with a cord organizer which was an unexpected pleasant surprise.
3,"Nice, but a little boomy in the low range","I saw a decent review of these on Cnet so I thought I would give them a try. These were said to have a great low range, but what I've consistently noticed is that the bass almost always sounds boomy. I love bass, but I need to have some clarity there too. The pair I had before these was the Creative EP-630s (I lost them). I would recommend those over the vmodas.4/22/09 update: these earbuds no longer work. I think loose wiring has caused the left side to go out completely. Mind you, I have taken perfectly reasonable care of the things. I'm wishing I hadn't bought these."
1,"Great headphone, but they'll break on you","I'm actually a big fan of V-Moda products; of all the under $30 headphones these are my favorites. But after having 3-4 pair of these I can't recommend them anymore. They sound great, but after a couple weeks something breaks where the cable meets the audio jack and the headphone will stop working. This has happen with every V-moda headphone of this type that I've bought. It's just crappy construction/design. They changed the jack for the newer models, and it's work great on those. But I'd stay away from this model unless you want to replace it in 2 months."
4,Great value for the quality!,"I did some research on these earbuds on CNET and they rated them really high, so I thought I'd give them a shot. I used to have some Sony earbuds before for around the same price, however these are far superior. Great sounds, great bass, I think a great overall value."
4,Great value,"These earbuds are awesome. I was first not very impressed with it until I took it to my gym. The gym has loud music, loud machines, etc, and these earbuds were able to drown 99% of the sound when I put the volume about half way! Coming from a apple earbud user, these things make a huge difference! The bass is great (not too overpowering) and the sound quality is really good for the price. The cord does seem a little on the cheap end, but they're really not bad and it should last you years if you take care of them. I would easily buy these again in the future and I suggest it to anyone looking for great value earbuds."
1,"Good enough for everyday use, but very cheaply made","Left earbud snapped as I took it out of the packaging. The amount of strength I put into taking it out was equivalent to opening a fortune cookie. I didn't want to bother with the warranty as I needed them right away so I just scotched taped it back together.I bought these because they were cheap, I like big bass, and they came in a cool color (rocket red).BEWARE: if you plan to buy these, they most likely won't last very long due to durability issues."
3,Good sound but iffy construction,"I really like these headphones overall, which is why I keep buying them--but they keep breaking. My first set was probably my fault, but I could never figure out where the wiring went wrong. However, when I re-bought them within a month (of heavy use, I admit) the plastic had broken right where the plug goes into my iPod and very quickly they became completely useless. I'm always very careful to not wind them too tight so I don't really know what went wrong there. That being said, I haven't found a pair of headphones that I like more in terms of sound, comfort, stability (I can run with these), and price; so I guess I'll just have to keep an extra pair in my closet for when my current one breaks."
2,"good sound, doesnt last so long.",Didnt use it for more than 2 months before it start malfunctioning. Get something else.
2,Bass but at what expense?,"Unfortunately, the design team succeeded in providing lots of bass which, in my opinion, is overwhelming. The big, boomy bass is muddied, not at all tight and tends to greatly diminish the mids and distort the highs. The bass is overtly prevalent throughout the frequency range. Soundstage is almost meaningless. Separation of instruments cannot be distinguished. Vocals sound harsh and nasal-like. Perhaps these are decent if you listen to nothing but bass heavy music, but they are not at all balanced and will cause some weary listening after an hour or so. These certainly are not for acoustic, vocal, jazz, or classical listening.I did find them comfortable enough, but the build quality appears to be inferior to other similarly-priced phones. Overall, I do not feel they offer a good buy...too much hype, and not enough substance unless, as I implied, you really need this amount of bass and consider yourself a true basshead."
4,Hard to put down,"COWS is Bataille-like in its use of disgust as a pathway to sublimity--as if James Ellroy wrote a novel based on a Paul McCarthy performance. It's absurd, titillating mental self-abuse--yet clearly Mr. Stokoe knows how to tell a good story, and create sympathetic (if putrid) characters. Even beyond that, he's got some kind of powerful moral compass, a deep interest in human existence. I'm a horror fan, but this goes way beyond, knee-deep in the poetics of filth. I expected to feel bad/ill/guilty for having read it, but oddly I actually felt the moral boost that comes from digesting something important. I'm not sure we need art like this, frankly--I certainly wouldn't want to catch my kids reading it--yet I feel that it's worth reading, if you can stomach it, that is. I just ordered his follow-up ""High Life"" from AbeBooks (got it for only $14.95) and am dreading/looking forward to reading it."
4,I really liked it!,"I really liked it (I have the Original Motion Picture Soudtrack and I'm not sure how much diffrent it is), but I already had the soundtrack to Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, and most of this is straight out of that."
5,THEY NEED MORE THAN FIVE STARS FOR THIS CD!!,"I am a sort of Sountrack collector, and own over 40 of them. This cd has got to be one of the top three that I own. The delicate Ba'ku Village combines the sensitivity and innocence of simplified living, while all of the other tracks are just plain awesome. If you like star trek, or just love nice music, get this cd."
2,Extremely Disappointing for a Star Trek fan and music lover.,"While watching the movie (twice) the music seemed very nice. But after listening to the CD (twice) I found it very disappointing. There aren't many longer orchestrations and the CD overall is under 45 minutes. Perhaps the worst thing about the piece is that the music unique to this movie sounds very much like ""Forest Gump the Next Generation"" Jerry Goldsmith has done much better than this."
4,Star Trek: Insurrection,"This is a great soundtrack. The ultimate songs by Goldsmith are ""New Sight"" and ""The Drones Attack"". Sadly one of the best songs of the film, ""The Holoship"", was left out. That seems to happen to many of the best songs in the Star Trek releases. ""The Ba'ku Village"" and ""The Healing Process/End Credits"" are great additions to the Goldsmith collection (even though the film had an alternate ending). First Contact reassured me in Jerry Goldsmith, and now that I have Insurrection, I can see the greatness in Star Trek 1 and 5. I am dissapointed that the soundtrack is so short, but sadly it seems to be that way for many of the recent Goldsmith releases. Enjoy this soundtrack, but see the film for more of what the soundtrack could have been."
5,WORKS GREAT. JUST LOVE IT,It is calming to watch and it is quite. Comes in tack. Small enought to put anywhere. Recycles it own water
2,The Telletubies are really from Pluto,The guy is entertaining but obviously woke up on the wrong side of the bed. I wish I had some of the dreams this guy has.
4,Rare Lassus well performed,"At a glance, this recording of Lassus' sacred works might seem a mixed bag. Yes, we have Tallis Scholars with their own usual polite voices, but I found them a bit detached for my taste - expecially in the 'Osculetur Me' Mass (not the best Lassus's thing, I guess).Probably only the sublime 'Agnus Dei' has that kind of evocative mood I'm used to get from these guys (have you heard their Taverner's 'Dum Transisset Sabbatum'? if yes, probably you understand well what I'm trying to say).Without doubt more attractive it is the motet anthology - a more colourful, variegated choice, I would say. The Tallis appear more persuasive and I would recommend, for example, the very good 'Hodie completi sunt', or 'Salve Regina' but probably, above all others, there is the quite short but excellent ending motet 'Regina caeli'."
5,As described. Fits perfectly,"This item fits perfectly on 99 Honda Accord LX Sedan. I installed it few months ago and it is working perfectly. Not that very hard to install, there are some tutorials online. I got it for a good price through amazon."
1,Didnt Fit,"The part they sent was not the right size for my 1997 Honda Accord, Before I could put it in the return window lapsed. Now I am stuck, do not believe it fits your car."
4,Smooth overview.,"I enjoy using these books to fight brain rot, not to get a degree or become an expert. The organization allows me to learn a bit more about what I want to learn more about, and sometimes to realize that a field is not for me. The Anatomy book has a few blips that were off-putting for me such as the author using a baby character to make asides, but overall the book introduced major human body systems in digestible chunks. I enjoy the chapter/quiz section/test set up and see no reason why a moderately motivated person can not score 100% throughout and get a nice ego boost. Perhaps this might be useful for a student who is unsure about advanced classes in the future in order to get a confidence boost."
2,annoyingly simple,"I have had great success with other books in this series, such as the pharmacology and algebra. but wow. one review said it was for high schoolers studying anatomy. hopefully your high school had a better science department than this book is appropriate for. I might recommend for the middle school level, or even upper elementary. However, it is insulting to an adult that has any science background. Almost every other word is spelled out phonetically, which is both insulting and incredibly distracting. In addition, the information isn't in depth enough to be useful for most anatomy classes. Save your money, buy a used anatomy text, and use the free sites on the internet."
2,Save Your Money,"While seamanship and basic military skills are fairly timeless, some of the institutional content herein was already obsolete when this manual was published, and is mostly out of date now. Revised in '99, apparently at the upper end of a silo of outdated assumptions. Save your money and buy the new manual whenever it finally gets released, hopefully ground-truthed with all pertinent CG communities and ""steadied ship"" programs referenced."
5,Fantastic!,"Don't let the title fool you! A College of Magics is far more than a school story. It is a very deep, satisfying plot with many surprises. I was enthralled from beginning to end.Stevermer's writing is deliberate and stately and suits the subject matter perfectly. Her alternate universe, an imaginary European nation in the 1910's in a world where magic is not uncommon, is real and believable. Her characters, Faris and Jane especially, are well fleshed and engaging.On the whole, this is one of the best novels I've read this year and I am delighted I stumbled across it!"
4,great but dissapointing,"The product is great. It is so light and small that it fits anywhere. The screen is bright and easy to work. I am dissapointed because the product does say that you can fit 500 songs but that is not true. They should be truthful and say that it is possible to fit up to 500 songs since you have to take into consideration the actual ""size"" of the song. In other words, how long the song may be has to do with how many you can fit. All in all I was able to fit 211 songs. Not even close to half but I do like it."
4,Intense guitar document,This Satriani release started as moderate a TV special became both a CD and a DVD concert. What you get here is intensive guitar playing from one of the most consistent guitar players around. This set serves as good compilation of Satriani's musical history as it covers all the bases in terms of songs and albums in his career. Great collection of guitar driven rock for hard rock and guitar fans.
3,"Good stuff, but a little ""sloppy""","I've been a long-time fan of Joe Satriani and eagerly awaited the release of this 2-disc set. On the first listen the music seemed somewhat cluttered and in many sections Joe seems to be rushing through sections of songs in order to hit every note, regardless of whether or not that note is ""in time"". I've been waiting to hear Mystical Potato Head Groove Thing live on a CD for quite a while, and I have to say that I was disappointed with the live treatment it got on this CD - the ""feel"" just isn't there - it feels more like a race to just get the song over with. When I saw this concert live in a different venue it was MUCH more entertaining than it is on the CD. I guess with music this intense the live experience is better than listening to it at home."
4,"Love the glasses, screws are a flaw though","PROS:I Love these glasses and use them on a daily basis. They make good sunglasses and the color of the lens are good for a laugh. I always tell people I ""look at the world through rose colored glasses"", Literally. I have bought multiple pairs to keep in the car, at home, to give people, and in case I lose a pair.CONS:The screws on these are a definite problem. If you look through the reviews that is the main contention people have with these glasses. The screws loosen Very easily. The way I've dealt with this issue is when I get the glasses I take all the screws off paint them with clear nail polish, then screw it back together before the polish dries. This stops the screws from comming loose, a pain to do but worth it in the end.CONCLUSION:A great pair of glasses for daily use, gifts, or a laugh. Would have been 5 stars if not for the screw issue."
3,These are not really toys amazon..,"I really like these things, and they are used for a costume and they create the effect I was looking for perfectly, however I must handle them with kid gloves because they are really fragile."
4,Amazing!,"These glasses are durable and comfortable. They look just like their photo too! Usually things look better in pictures and are miss leading. no, these glasses are awsome!"
1,Very Fragile Glasses!,"I purchased two pair of these glasses. They are really great to wear on occasions but are very fragile. Within days of wearing, both pair lost the screws which held the lenses in place and had to be repaired."
3,Crap packaging.,the glasses look awesome but the bubble wrap envelope they came in left them a bit bent. took me 3 hours to bend them back to perfect shape. They need to use a better packing method as so to protect the glasses on future shipments.
3,"Very little of his philosophy, just reminiscences of his interesting life","The reader will learn a very great deal about Sterling McMurrin's life and various positions he held. That is interesting, but I (ignorantly) expected more of his philosphy. So, buyer beware."
3,A good starter,"Very easy to figure out and use, the tools are basic but well chosen. It is showing its age and price range in a few places; only 32 tracks supported, audio not supported, quantize is either full or none (no percent quantize or beat quantization). The biggest reason I continue using it is because the ""piano roll"" display mode is capable of showing all tracks on the same representational keyboard. Wonderful for figuring out those interlocking horn parts. The biggest flaw (for me) is a poorly thought out and even more poorly documented patch naming system that forces me to go through screen after screen of unintuative choices if I change so much as one MIDI channel assignment on one piece in a session that week. I'd give it four stars, but the lack of audio makes it a poor contender in today's market."
4,More Math for a Mother making a comeback,I am very happy with this book it is in great shape. I needed it for a class I am taking and the price was exactly what I was looking for. Shipping was speedy fast and I was doing my homework in no time.
3,"Edition, What Edition ?","This item was delivered in a very timely manner. It was quiet a surprise to receive it so quickly. What the problem was, was that it was the TOTALLY WRONG EDITION, and I could not find the paperwork to return IT. It wasn't until the 3rd week of the school year till I was able to see that it was off-----the page that would say the edition had been removed / prior to my receiving it. Another case of Buyer Beware !"
2,Punch vs 3d home architect 4.0,"Punch is a limited program that is not very intuitive. The walls dont self sguare for a room, door choices are few, closet doors are limited, and measuring is difficult. I went to 3d Home, faster more intuitive, easier to use. Punch was a waste."
2,"Ok floor plan, but lots of features not really working","We've looked a number of products. Unfortunatly none seem to be really good. We found the floor planning in this tool to be ok, but there are lots of features that just don't work. For instance, I can't get the roofs to have any pitch besides 12:12. I think that the other options available, and the custom roof tool itself, are just not implemented. I hate buying SW with incomplete functions."
2,Don't Bother,"This book is a bunch of lectures stitched together to spin a negative picture of Thomas Jefferson. This is really poor. Unless you're a Jefferson basher, as far as reading this book is concerned, I suggest you don't bother."
1,Do not get the pink rub-off shoe,"I don't know about the other colors, which seem to look okay, but the pink color is terrible!!! The rub off really means messy and ugly spots of pink and white all over. It is not evenly ""rubbed on."" The shoe color is nothing like the picture. I am returning it."
5,Outstanding Reference Guide and Tutorial,"This book was well above what I expected when I needed a rapid primer on IS auditing. It is a combination training manual (very detailed) as well as reference book which now resides in the reference area of my bookshelf. I find myself using it almost every day for information or as a 'how to' guide.Don't expect to absorb this material in a couple of days, or even weeks. Each time I review it again, I find additional points to reflect on and apply to my operation. Most highly recommended !"
1,I would never buy something...,"...where the goofs who made it can't even bother to spell the subject of the interview's name correctly on the packaging. It's ScorSese, not ScorCese, geniuses. Easy mistake to make though, I guess; Scorsese has only been directing some of the best films for the past 35+ years. [/sarcasm]"
4,The great Ronald Colman &Vincent Price,"Great Film, Great fun only downside is a poor transfer. Maybe we can hope for a restoration when the DVD comes out."
5,Told me what I need to do to help my family through Y2K!!,"Jackie Kessler's book, ""Your Year 2000 Survival Guide"", showed my family how to organize our home safely for Y2K and how to stock up sensibly for Y2K shortages that may occur in food, household things, and medicines. She helps you think out each family's special situation. This is NOT a one size fits all book. Here in the Northeast, on Cape Cod, keeping my family and home warm in the dead of winter is a real concern. Her suggestions are sensible and always with safety in mind. I felt her advice was very valuable. BP"
3,Good review book,"A well rounded book, but it doesn't give you much hands on practice. Good coverage of Forms. The lacking part of this book is that it doesn't provide you the Sql file, so it hard to do hands on practice. CD that comes with it has the code, but you can't do much with it as the underlying tables are missing."
3,Um livro é pouco para abranger toda certificao,"Ainda estou lendo o livro, acho que seu conteúdo segue exatamente o que cai na prova, mas também acho que o autor poderia ter sido mais abrangente, dando mais exemplos práticos e descrevendo a síntaxe dos comandos mais usados. Isto poderia ter sido feito lanando dois ou mais livros."
4,Gamble Rogers,"I ordered this item without being sufficiently careful as to whether it was a CD or a record. It is in good shape, and arrived as advertised, but I have not been able to hear it because of my own oversight."
2,Great potential but in the end dissapointing,"I should have paid more attention to most of the reviews. This Esteban is a good marketeer and good for him - he has sold over two million CDs. The problem - his music is great to listen to when you are not paying attention to it. If you are in the mood to pay attention to it or you are playing the CD in your car, you will notice that he almost destroys the originals. For one thing, why is it that he decided to use electronic drums - Now, he is playing an acoustic guitar for heavens sake. Please don't buy this CD for it musicianship or originality just buy it for filling up the silence in a party. Sorry Esteban you are dissapointing."
1,Only in America,"Only in America can a so-so guitarist sell 2 million copies of cover songs that any college student with a bit of talent can play. I have also seen him perform on the shopping channel and found it very BORING. Talk about getting a lucky break. You know what is so frustrating? To see real talent go unrecognised. A talented composer, an electrifying performer and an extremely skillful guitarist can only be one person. ALEX FOX, ALEX FOX, ALEX FOX, ALEX FOX."
5,"Easy to read, but so so fun","I first read, ""In Place of Katia"" when i was about 10 years old or so. I was at my grandparents house, when my grandma showed me a very old looking book, it was her copy of, ""in place of katia."" I've read this book so many times by now, i have it completely memorized. It isn't a hard read at all, it's very easy, and ment for children, but i still never get tired of it."
3,A FICTIONAL novel of Marie Laveau,"I wish that had been included in the title...I would have been much less disappointed when I got all the way through this book thinking this was based on real events until I got to the author's afterward where she basically said ""Oh well I really just took my grandmother and made her Marie Laveau"". Now, I'll admit, I don't know a whole lot about Laveau so I was willing to believe the storyline. But finding out that none of it NONE of it was based on what was known about Laveau left a pall on this book in my mind. Three stars because I enjoyed it before I was disillusioned."
4,Fit's Better by far!,"This filter seems to do the job as expected. The best part, though, is the fit. Just enough shaved off the dimensions to make it easy to seat it in the furnace. Just the right size to make it cover all sides properly. More rigid and it fit's better by far than what I was Using. So far I'm happy!"
5,Palestrina Masses: Missa Brevis; Missa Nasce la gioja mia,Palestrina Masses: Missa Brevis; Missa Nasce la gioja mia~ Peter Phillips is a wonderful recording and verily one could call Palestrina one if not the best composer for the Catholic Church. The painting on the front is a grand picture of a young woman and the liner notes are well written. Palestrina is such a skilled writer of choral music and one of best writers and composers of this genre of all time. Highly recommended.
2,"It's your typical sports book, and it's not too good.",The Big Stick is a book about a guy named Rusty and his success with hockey. It's mostly predictable and is not very exciting. It tells about a lot of hockey games and puts in some play-by-play accounts of some of the games. It's not especially exciting and I wouldn't recomend it.
4,Good Massage tool. Not a Magic Wand but great for the money!,"Good Massage tool. Not a Magic Wand but great for the money!If you have more to spend get a magic wand but if you need something cheaper, this works good."
3,Wahl massager,"This product is o.k. for the price. However one of the massager pieces was not made properly and would not fit on to the base ergo it wouldn't work. It was one of the pieces I wanted to use most. Not worth all of the drama of returning the item, etc. so I am keeping it."
4,Works well for muscle relief,I have a muscle problem with my shoulder. I use this on the shoulder occasionally to help relieve the pressure and pain. It works great. I really like that it has multiple attachments to target different muscles.
5,Best Massager on the Market,This is the best massager you will ever purchase. I've tried many makes/models and none compare to this one. Liked it so much I ordered several. Never want to be without it!
2,Fire Hazard,"We owned 2 previous walh massagers which worked great and lasted a long time. This newest incarnation is such a poorly made device that I think I shall be avoiding Wahl products for the foreseeable future. The cord / switch is a weak point that shorts out inside and creates a very real fire risk. We bought one that lasted 4 weeks then when we turned it on, it shorted out inside and started to smoke, so we unplugged it right away, and took it back to exchange it for a new one, thinking we got a lemon. The next one lasted 1 week. After use, we turned it off and set it down, and as we were leaving the room, we could hear a funny noise soon followed by a bad smell. The massager had shorted out again. If we had been quicker leaving the room, we could very well have had a fire on our hands. We will not be getting another wahl."
2,Not good for deep tissue,"Like another reviewer said, this is not as robust as the older model - as usual things get made more cheaply as time goes on. For a thickly muscled person that wants to work out deep knots, go for a more robust percussion massager. This unit does not have the intensity nor power for much more than surface stimulation. If you apply any pressure at all, the unit begins to clatter. A little more pressure and the motor binds completely. One more design flaw, the switch is at the finger grip, and just a slight squeeze can move the switch enough to cut the power - can be very frustrating. Major design oversight that just adds to the disappointment in this one. Only redeeming thing was the myriad of attachments but quality is still lacking. I wish I could rate this one higher, but you get what you pay for in this case."
4,Pretty good.,"This is my first massager so I don't have any comparisons.I am pretty satisfied with it.Lots of different massage addons for different feels. Decent power.I wish there was another option for more power, but it is pretty inexpensive, so no complaints."
2,too noisy,this product is too noisy. it doesn't help to relax you. I do not use it any more the sound is too ennoying. it worked well the first week.
4,Awesome!!!,I work as a hairstylist and as of late have been getting tremendous knots in my shoulders and upper back (from my work). Since I can't throw down $200 every week for a professional massage I decided to begin investigating back massagers. I have to say that this thing irons out the deep knots in my back extremely well and you really cannot beat the price. I use the traingular attachment as it seems to work best for this. Great product!
1,Mrs,"Bought this as a gift, but only can be used in U.S, called customer service, they said that if you use in other country, it will cause FIRE, so returned."
5,Does the job well!,"What I love about this product is it's durability. We use it quite often and for long periods of time (hour or so) and it does the trick. As far as the attachments, we only use one to pinpoint the problem area; the rest we never use. But this is our second Wahl massager, the first one lasted for about 10 years before playing out and so we didn't even look at any others. For a hand-held massager - it's the best!"
5,Happy customer,"Happy with my purchase, great value, fast shipment and the quality is far better than with my RGB cables that are being replaced."
5,Works Great!,Don't hesitate to buy this cable. It works great. Dont listn to what people say about such and such cable has better connectivity because its made way better. Its all a lie to justify a higher cost. HDMI is digital. Digital is digital. You either have a 1 or a 0. It either works or it doesnt. so dont listen to people that say well the picture wont look as nice on a cheaper cable. Its just not true.
2,Great price... but where is the product?,Ordered this over a week ago. Still sitting in some warehouse in CA per USPS tracking. They charge like $5 per item... the least they can do is deliver. I'll let you know how the cables are if they ever arrive.
1,Works until it doesn't,"This cable worked great for about 3 months and then all of a sudden it no longer transmitted sound, thus worthless. The video still goes through, but not sound. I guess for $5 what do you expect. Spend a few dollars more and get a cable that is a bit sturdier."
5,Spent $2 instead of $60. Cable worked perfectly for PS3 connection to new Samsung LCD HDTV 46'' with Touch of Red,"I bought new Samsung LCD HDTV (46'') and a Playstation 3 (PS3). I went to Target and purchased the cheapest HDMI cable available (from Sony) for a whopping $60.00. After 2 days of watching Blueray and playing PS3 games, these less than $2 cables arrived. I made the switch and they worked perfectly. I could see no difference in image quality. I went back to Target and got my $60 back."
4,working great so far,"I had a little trouble with the shipping. This was not the fault of the company at all, I had typed in the address incorrectly. They helped me correct the problem and was delivered the next day. The cable is working great so far. Didn't think it would be a real big difference ... Boy was I wrong. You can really notice the higher quality."
5,can't complain,"it just worked like magic with my ps3 connecting to 46"" LCD tv. The quality is just amazing and don't see anything being compromised. Great deal."
5,Good Buy at this Price,I did not do much review on HDMI cables as all branded HDMI cables are 10 times costlier than this one. I bought two and both are serving their purpose very well. I would definetely recommend it
1,Thumbs Down!,"Bought to spray latex paint on new remodel job...walls, ceilings and trim. Had paint thinned accordingly. This thing leaked paint like a sieve from around the front nozzle all over the floor...good thing for good prep! This unit would spray for a little time, stop, sputter, spit globs of paint, then not work some more.After 30 minutes of use it just quit working....Thank god! Not wanting to sound like I am biased and manufacturer bashing, I'm not, the fact is, I shy away from B&D; products and find them inferior for my taste, this sprayer is no different, I did not select it.This is being returned tomorrow for a Wagner Power Painter."
4,Reasons I like it.,The clip is really strong and I need to use two hands to open it to slide it over my belt or pants fabric.The lid does not open when I don't want it to... even though it's just magnetically fastened.Fits the Pam Treo 680 perfectly along with room for a half dozen business cards. I'm able to connect a charger or the wired headset through the corner gaps.It's black and the padded leather is smooth.
4,all peak time energy,this is a must buy. the first 3 tracks are high energy house. then starts the trance beat. the music continues to build all the way through. i'm only giving 4 stars because it's difficult to listen to this at one playing without some beat fatigue setting in. but this is one of the best compilations on the market. don't pass it up. also check out 'circuit grooves 9.1.'
1,"Wow, these things were awful.","I purchased them to keep in contact with another couple while we were at Disney World on vacation. They had almost no range at all and in fact, only worked when we were in sight of each other already, even with brand new batteries. I will be returning them and hopefully replacing them with a more suitable product."
1,Avoid this product...,"This product was substandard. In tests the radios were unable to transmit voices, they transmitted so much static you could not hear the other person from 200 ft away. Tried new batteries and still received too much static to hear the other person. Static did not occur on every transmission but did occur in 80% of the trials. We purchased a set of Motorola Talkabouts and have been pleased with their performance."
1,Don't Believe a Word of It,"Ms. Brownmiller has concluded that President Clinton did indeed rape Juanita Broadrick, but that it doesn't matter because Clinton is so virile that he didn't realize he was raping her until after he was finished. How can anyone call herself a feminist when she utters such crap! Why defend the pig? Because he supports partial birth abortion? But rapists will always be doctrinaire pro-choice. Let's just say that fatherhood is not a priority with them.If you defend abortion AND rape, you condemn women to a form of servitude unheard of in modern times. I used to respect this book, but how can you trust someone who wants to convert the feminist movement into the Ladies' Auxiliary for Democratic rapists?"
1,racist,"I am not looking for kudos from other readers (nor shouts of execration)--Brownmiller's discussion of the murder of Emmet Till is an outrage--she has also I believe gone on to defend--even in the face of incontravertable evidence to the contrary--the story of the central park ""attack"" on a woman jogger.One thing American history has not faced--and will have to (it came out a bit in the Hillary Obama campaign) is the hidden emnity between civil rights for Black People and Women's liberation--a story that goes back to Frederic Douglas and resurfaced ina confrontation between middle class women and Mrs, Fannie Lou Hamer. The women's movement in the UK had a similar problem--class based--between Christobel and Sylvia Pankhurst.This is an outrageous book."
1,Lasted one day,"This was neat for a few minutes' of play on Day One. It stopped working on Day Two. New batteries didn't help - the motor was dead. I called the toy co.'s customer service, got sent to voice mail, and haven't heard anything back in a week."
4,Ludacris Uncut,"Ludacris has released his first full length musical DVD. ""The Red Light District"" DVD features a full length concert from Luda. It also includes some behind the scenes footage from his trip to Amsterdam. Don't expect to find the BET versions of the videos from ""The Red Light District"" CD or the regular video for ""Pimpin All Over The World."" The videos on this set are uncut and feature new versions of the videos with very scantilly clad women. Parents consider yourself warned there is some nudity ""crotch shots and all"" in this set."
2,The previous two were better,"This was a disappointment compared to her first two mysteries. Unholy death is repetitious and monotonous to the point where I used it to fall asleep at night. Most of the characters are as three-dimensional as cardboard. One character is mocked by the author because she (the character) is reluctant to drink beer like everyone else - as if beer-drinking-for-the-sake-of-conformity on campus were not the serious problem that it is! On the positive side, however, the Theological Seminary setting is interesting. Some good ideas, not artistically developed. Hopefully, if she writes another one, it will be an improvement over this."
2,Two stars.,"Ambitious, but stiff. Cool in places, but rambling in others. Editor and agent may be to blame."
1,Needed an editor,"I saw hints of good writing hidden beneath a lot of drivel in this book. Conrad really really needed someone to objectively edit this novel - it would have been so much better. I felt that the book really lacked any definite structure and that superfluous descriptions dragged on for pages. I was bored and frustrated for most of the novel. Good title, though."
5,"Sublime, brilliant, funny","Conrad's debut has the confidence and steady prose of someone writing a fiftieth, not a first, novel. The story is a timeless one, however - the debut meets the mogul - in this case poet, in the academic world. The book is rich with taut, lively characters, who inhabit a world so many of us have traveled, trying not to choke as we did. This is a can't put down sort of book, and Conrad the most promising and delicious sort of writer. Get it and crawl into a big chair somewhere. I did, and didn't get up until I was through."
2,Not Worth It,"I bought this because it got fairly good reviews and was not too expensive. It was a total waste of money as far as I'm concerned. I only used the thing maybe twice. It took me about 45 minutes to get maybe 4 ounces of milk. This is the only pump I have ever used so 45 minutes may be the norm, but it was kinda pointless to me. By the time I finished pumping it was time to feed the baby again so I didn't really get any time to GO and do things around the house. It was quicker just to breast feed, but this may be a good purchase if you are desperate for a pump and can't afford a super good one. You may consider contacting your local hospital and they can rent you one that is ""industrial strength"" and it would probably be a smarter purchase."
4,Wonderful book,"Some of the other reviews need to be ignored by people unfamiliar with the topic. To say, as one of the reviewers did, that Christianity has never claimed that the Jews killed Christ is either ignorant or naive. As I don't know the person, I cannot comment either way. The Gospels are an infamous source of anti-semetism and anyone who has studied theology in an academic setting knows this to be fact.As for the book being ""another angle on Mel Gibson's film,"" well of course the Gibson film is flawed in many resepcts, particularily historicity. And Crossan's book is an ""angle"" on the Bible, not a film.The book is exceptional and I would recommend it without hesitation."
5,"""A slave's duty was to Love, Honor, Please and OBEY...""","As real as it gets. This brutally honest book describes in sometimes graphic detail the life, love and thoughts of an old guard slave, directly from her journals over several years. Vi Johnson began her journey as a slave at the time when ""...the concept of a 'safeword' would get you laughed out of a public playspace"". If you want to get a true feel for what it is like to be a true slave in every sense of the word, this is a *must read*."
1,Really a children's book,"As a Beagle owner I was intrigued by this title; unfortunately,I couldn't find much info about it, so in my enthusiasm I shelled outthe $.. and ordered it. I'm living overseas so I couldn't check it outat the local bookstore first. The book has 24 pages, which include atitle page,a credit page, a contents page,a glossary page (definingsuch words as 'ancestor"",""bacteria""and qualities"",and an index page.There are exactly 9 pages with little paragraphssuch as aell about Beagles; ""Beagles are Beautiful"", andFamous Beagles"". The photos are not special in any way. So, ifyou are a dog person looking for a serious dog book and willing to paya price..., you should know that this is a child's book -- anexpensive one! Usually amazon.com provides the dimemsions of the bookand the number of pages, but lack of this info can cost you dearly. Icould have bought a much, much better book for much less money, butnow I'm only disappointed."
1,never received product,I never received written word from this vendor nor did I ever receive the product
5,"Practical, useful tools for lasting change","Some people still seem to consider NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) to be a ""gimmick."" Quick change, therefore it can't last, just a splash in the pan. I assure you this is not the case. In Heart of the Mind, you will learn some NLP processes you can put to immediate use and get meaningful, lasting change. I read the book several years ago and still benefit from the ""naturally slender eating strategy"" and ""becoming more independent in relationships,"" among other things. I highly recommend this book to any student of NLP as well as any individual who wants to make meaningful changes in his/her life."
3,Interesting collection,I was disappointed in the instructions which are not clear and require considerable review before proceeding with each row. There are easier ways to write patterns and this would have made the book more accessible.
3,From all over the world,"I love knitting dolls, but I couldn't find any books about that in my own language. But this book was great, so I bought it. I wondered if I would understand the knitting-resepies. But everything is explained really good in the first chapter. So if you aren't that good in english you still will understand it, i think.The dolls are really great, in three different levels."
5,Memories!,"Oh, the memories! I was given a tape of this album when my children were very young. Priscilla has a wonderfully mellow, beautiful voice and we enjoyed the mix of playful and soothing songs on this CD. ""Waltzing with Bears"" was a favorite, played over and over again as we danced around the living room. And my daughter actually used ""Matthew, Mark, Luke & John"" recently in a college worksheet, so she obviously also has fond memories. Even the boys smiled when I started playing the CD after it arrived. I was thrilled to find this since the tape wore out long ago. Once again I'm ""waltzing with bears"" and looking forward to the time when I can dance and sing with grandchildren."
3,Good late night fun,"Candy Stripers won't win any awards, and it certainly borrows from other movies such as Aliens and Body Snatchers, but c'mon it is a fun little movie and is worth a watch.An alien of unknown origin infects an auto accident victim who is wheeled into a hospital. She spreads the alien to a candy striper with a kiss. Then the fun begins. It doesn't take long before all the candy stripers are devouring all sweets in the hospital, including suger packets.Our heros are high school basketball players, a cheerleader, and a diabetic geek chick who is a sister to one of the players. They discover a way to kill the aliens and begin runniing around the hospital Rambo style with air guns filled with insulin.The special effects are OK, the candy stripers are hot, and we get some decent kills. It's a good DVD to pull out every now and then."
4,Recommended Gem,It is an extremely interesting book that is completely informative about the history of the English language and how it not only came to be what it is today but predictions about what it will become in the future. The prose is very easy to read and you find yourself pronouncing dialects out loud to just get a good idea of what it would sound like if you were from that part of the world. This was a recommended book by my professor and I was not going to purchase it but I'm glad I did considering the other two required texts are not as interesting!
5,Dominique Francon in space,A model for how corporate invasiveness in the educational system might prove Ayn Rand right. This book demonstrates in can't-put-it-down fiction how rational billionaires might choose to finally ditch NASA and really get mankind into space. Any objectivist would love this book (but I liked it too.)
2,"""Not as Good As The Originals""","""Rainbow Six 3:Black Arrow"" is just a bigger version of the original. But the Online Multiplayer has bigger maps and a new gun. The story isn't bad, considering that it's a First-Person Shooter. The A.I. is a little bit smarter, but thats not saying much, plus there's only ONE new gun. And whats the point in having Retrievel in a Squad Based Tactical game. It gets really stupid, and there really is no point in making this game. Say what you want, ""Black Arrow"" isn't that great to me. I realized that it's just like the original, just bigger. ""Halo 2"" may have the same problem, but people want ""Halo 2"" to be alot like ""Halo"", just a little bit bigger."
1,I want my MTV video,It was sent fast got it right away. This video was try rember the start on MTV. No problems watching it
3,Trendy and Hip,"This torchiere is very tall and fits perfectly with my decor. If your not into trendy lights, you may want to stick with a more traditional torchiere. The orange glow that illuminates from the center is very cool...three way bulb not included. The outer shade is kind of thin but the main inner shade that houses the lighting is well made. For the price it really is a bargain and may be more suitable for a dorm room...but somehow I made it fit right at home."
1,Ummmm... what was the author thinking?,"I hate to say it, but I found this book to be terrible. It has a lot of ""practical guidance"" but it largely ignores focusing on the tactical and strategic aspects of a project management COE. I was looking for something that was more than a simple ""nuts and bolts"" guide. Simple nuts and bolts don't help to get business plans approved... My advice, pass over this one and find something that focuses at a high level as well as in the details."
4,Great book no CD,"The content of the book are good, practical and I plan to use it in setting up a PMO in my workplace.Howevere, the book did not come with CD, Amazon shipped it again, without CD. Called up the publisher and was informed it was production issue. They are fixing it and will come up with an alternative arrangement in a short period.Amazon needs to reflect this on their site. For those buying the book you might have to wait for the CD."
5,What a ball of LAUGHS!!!,"This is truly an uncensored rendition of life as a human being and a trucker, part of which I identify with, and there something here that everyone at some point or another would be able to identify with. I also liked that the book was short and to the point, telling some funny and real stories. I will be looking for more from this author, for I'm sure he has plenty of stories for a complete series. Read and enjoy!!"
5,Fun Children's Music!,"I taught K-6 general music ed. for 6 years and used this CD in many of my ""funnest"",memorable classes. The kids find these tunes catchy, original and extremely singable. I love their use of clean diction. Truely creative!"
4,Great little book,"I found this book at a flea market, took it home and made really tasty, easy meals, soups, side dishes, puddings and breakfast.No pretty photos just 365 easy recipes!I Served number #201 ""Spaghetti With Tomatoes, Bacon, and Onions"" to guests,(I added Red Pepper flacks, roasted red peppers and portabella mushrooms because I like them) and got rave reviews.#236 "" Tricolor Bell Pepper Sauce with Imported Black Olives and Anchovies"" was wonderful.#84 ""Spaghetti with lemon butter"" is super easy to make and a great side dish for shrimp.#209 Linguine Tuna Black olives & Tomatoes, M-m-m-m.I melted cheese over this one.I have NOT put on a pound. I watch the amount of pasta I eat and feel up on all the goodies.I have gone to Amazon and bought this book for friends and family."
4,"""Barracuda"" Great Read","Mr. DiMercurio has written an all-around great military thriller with ""Barracuda Final Bearing"". He clearly knows his subs and their crews.His descriptions make you feel like you were on board a Seawolf-class submarine. He also has made great predictions in his technology. This book would have made five stars if Mr. DiMercurio's had decided not to include his description of future aircraft. As an avid aviation enthusiast, I can tell when some one isn't in their element concerning flight. Despite this flaw, this is still a great book. I look forward to reading ""Pirahna Firing Point."""
3,Some Good Pointers But May Not Apply to Other Countries,"The book presents some good pointers for those who intend to invest in real estate. The most important being the income property must generate a positive cash flow and not just capital appreciation.Zero cash deals do not work in countries like Singapore where the authorities impose a max loan amount, as a percentage of sales/valuation , financial institutions can loan buyer. Organized in a readable manner with key points summarized at the end of each chapter, which serves as a good revision reminder."
5,Changed My Life,"Great book that is well written and easy to read, hard to put down. I'm now in the third week of the program and I've lost 7lbs., (from 186 to 179) and I'm already beginning feel healthier and more energenic, and beginning to see results in terms of muscle growth. This book is best for people who like me are beginners at exercising, I'm 23 but never worked out a day in my life until I read this. A few things you should know though is that you'll need to buy a calorie counting book (about $7) and join a gym ($50 a month), and you'll probably want to invest in some supplements after a few weeks in order to get the best results of muscle growth. The book asks alot of you in terms of commitment, its not some fad diet that will give you results for a month and then watch as the results disappear, it is a lifestyle change, but its definitely worth it as long as you can be serious about it."
3,What about the women?,"First off, I would like to say that this is a wonderful book and a great program...if you are a man. The problem that I have is that he gives testimonials/stories of famous women that he has trained, but all of his meal plans etc. only talk about men. For example, he gives three levels of nutrition plans. The lowest level is for MEN between 5'5"" and 5'7"" who weigh over 155 lbs. What do you do if you are a 5'7"" woman and only weigh 132lbs? I would LOVE to do this program, but I feel like any adjustments that I would make to work it for a woman would only be a shot in the dark."
3,NOT BAD,GOOD ACTTING GOOD MUSIC TRIPPY FUN MOVIE YOU WILL HAVE TO SEE 2X BUT THE KEY WORD IS TIME TRAVIL
5,fantastic,"Dorling Kindersley puts out some fantastic books. 59 pages, with multiple well labeled images on each page. Very well done. Covers all the systems of the body."
3,Best of Costa Rica,"This DVD is short, but interesting. Has a lot of information in its short time, though. Not sure it is worth the money for the length."
2,Good story...bad language,This is a good story. However it is lightly peppered with cussing which makes it inappropriate for its target audience of 3rd-7th graders.
4,It was a good book.,"This book was about a boy named Doug and his brother Gordon. Gordon is always bothering Doug. Their family went to a camp and Gordon found abeautiful spot however there was troble because Doug was not able to get there. Because thats the fear place. Then their parents leave them alone in the wildness because they are called to a family emergency. To find out what happens you mst read this, is full of cool things and i really like it."
1,Outdated,"Borland has now released JBuilder Enterprise version 8, making this product severly outdated and overpriced."
4,Something is better than nothing...,"While the author seems dispassionate and measured enough, there is the hard reality that the documentary base on which to make a judgement about Chiang's character and career is sparse. This means that there are times when the record seems so lurid that one has to wonder what was really happening. That said, this will give the general reader a feel for Chinese state that the Generalissimo tried to build, why he was undone by his personal limitations, and the perspective time has given us regarding his historic achievements."
3,This is an Import DVD from Korea With Korean Sub-Titles That Can't Be Turned off!,I agree with the previous reviewer that the classic 1944 film version of Jane Eyre staring Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine is obviously a great movie but this DVD is an import from Korea and has Korean subtitles (captions) that can't be turned off. I have nothing against the Korean language but I just don't like having sub-titles that can't be turned off and I also wouldn't like it if it was English sub-titles that couldn't be turned off! Someone needs to get this movie out on DVD in English with the other language sub-titles that can be turned off!
2,Not the best,"No offence to Orson Wells, but I do not like his portrayal of Rochester much. He is a little too wooden. It feels weird, the way he says in his very low voice: ""Jane! Jane!"" When he says her name, I don't know if I want to be frightened or sad or andry. He doesn't exhibit much emotion. SPOILER: He doesn't repent even in the end. He makes me feel very sorry for Jane. One might wonder how Jane would fall for someone like him.Joan Fontaine is fine as Jane Eyre. She lacks a little stubborness though as Jane. Young Elizabeth Taylor is a very angellic Helen. Sometimes though, I'm not sure if they want to make it a horror film (ex. When young Jane finds Helen dead, she screams. The camera is focused on the hands like a weird murder movie).In short, I didn't like this adaptation that much. I maybe biased though because I am a literary purist."
5,Delicious!!!,The cookies are the best GF packaged cookies. The only complaint I have about them is they seem to disappear!
1,Sweet and Mushy,"My son is 6 and he has celiac. He loves sweets, however when he took a bite of this wafers he was done with it. He said that it just was not good. I tasted it and had to agree with him. The only thing I could taste was the extreme sweetness and the fat sticking to the roof of my mouth."
1,Garbage,"Garbage. Don't waste your money. Took a pack on a weekend backpacking trip, worked fine... until it rained! Once the striker is wet they're useless. They are also brittle and have a tendency to break in half when striking. I can't believe I paid for these."
4,great read,"This is a 4 books in 1 set which is a reprint of the original Adventures in Odyssey books that were printed in the early 1990's. For the fans of the radio program and the videos they did, many of the characters found in the books are not in the radio program and videos because the books are set earlier than the others.This set is the first four books which includes Strange Journey Back, High Flyer With a Flat Tire, The Secret Cave of Robinwood, and Behind the Locked Door. In these books, Mark Prescott has just moved to Odyssey after his parents got divorced as that is where his grandmother used to live. He is about to have some unique adventures in Odyssey. But as these adventures unfold, Mark learns lessons about friendship, responsibility and living with change."
3,gas tank,Tank works great but hose and nozzle are extremly cheap. hose binds and kinks and will not last long nozzle drips and leaks.
4,Flo N Go Fluid Transfer Pump,Superb except quality of the hose is too thin causing it to easily pinch slowing flow of gas.
1,Very disappointing product,I purchased this fuel container approximately 9 months ago. It looked like a great product.Unfortunately this has been one of the most disappointing products I have used.* First is was a broken plastic hose clamp around the pump side. I fixed it with a metal one.* Fuel filling is very slow* Fuel splashes out of the container you are filling.* You have to be so careful with the hose so it does not kink.* Now the wheels do not rollAs I said a very disappointing product.
1,Flo and wait....,"As the other reviewer pointed out this thing isn't what you want. I agree, you can't get all the gas out and it is very slow to drain. Using gravity it took me at least a half hour to drain the tank. The wheels stopped working after the first warm day that expanded the tank. It might be better if you some how made a new output hose for it, but then again aren't they spose to figure that out at the factory...."
4,transfer pump,I havent had a opportunity to use it yet but it seems very well built and it beats hauling several cans to the filing station. will be easier to fill my garden tractor than lifting the cans over my head.
4,Helped me battle Hurricane Sandy,"Read a bunch of reviews. In need of a gas can that would help my family and I get through Hurricane Sandy, I came across the Moeller Duramax 14 gallon rolling gas can, and bought it. Have to say, this was perfect for what I needed. Was able to fill it up twice, use it to fill up my generator, and I can't say a bad thing about it. Filling the generator was easy with the hand pump. For the amount of time I will use it.... probably for the next hurricane, it turned out perfect. If you are someone who will use this daily trucking it around to work sites, etc., you may want to consider something more durable. But if you are looking to have an extra gas ultra gas can handy in your garage, this one has my vote."
2,not impressed,"I purchased this fuel pump during the extended power outage (and fuel shortage in our area) caused by Hurricane Sandy. Fuel was in short supply with rationing, and it was cumbersome to use so many little fuel cans to fill the generator. I purchased this thinking I would be able to fill it and use the fuel for the generator & vehicles as needed during the fuel rationing. I may have missed it in the description, but I don't remember seeing it, but it appears to be a gravity pump. this pump is probably good for filling boats in the water since they will be below the pump during filling. I've had to move the generator close to deck stairs, carry the heavy (full) pump up 3 stairs and then be able to pump fuel into the generator. Also the pump handle mechanism is a let down, it doesn't cut off when you release the handle, it takes about 5 seconds so you are either over-filling or spilling fuel.Not as expected, but I guess good for storing fuel in a shortage."
1,Does Not Drain Last Gallon or Two,"As indicated in the title of this review, the tank does not drain the last gallon or two of gas. This is a non-starter for me. Also, the newer design has a safety latch that makes it difficult to continuously pump without the gravity feed."
2,Bad Experience,"I started buying this Trucco Duo at the shop where I attended Cosmetology school, but it was very expensive. When I found it on Amazon at this price, I was thrilled.First problem: Instead of 'pinkish,' the pad looked orangey-brown, almost as though it had been used. Maybe it was just old - which was not a good sign for the powder itself!Second problem: I contacted the seller with my concerns and received no response.I went ahead a used the makeup with no ill affects, but it was not a great experience.I wouldn't purchase it again."
5,Field reading,This book contains a wonderful series of Articles on Comic Book Superheroes and Ethics. I read this book while I was at the Joint Readiness Training Center. All the articles were of an Ideal length so I could read one or two of them between lulls in Training. It also sparks several engaginging Conversations between my soldiers and myself about the nature of Ethics as a superhero and as a soldier. I highly recommend this book as light yet engaging reading. A masterful little work that combined a love of comics and philosophy.
1,Bad album. Check out their second release instead.,"I agree that this album was horrible. The recording was terrible, the male vocals were horrid and sounded distant, the instrumentals were mediocre, and the female vocals were definitely off in some parts. I took one listen and never listened again. Luckily though, I purchased their second album before ever hearing this one. The vocals are ten times better, there is- from what I could tell- a new male vocalist who is much better, the overall recorded sound is better and far less distant sounding, and the music is also improved. Skip this album and check out their second release.And they aren't Nightwish wannabees in my opinion. The female vocalist's voice is just similar to Tarja's. Big deal."
5,What do you expect from Blackhawk?,"I ordered this bag as a long term bushcraft/bugout bag, and as with all Blackhawk bags I've used, which is a lot, I'm once again very pleased. The stitching is very durable, and the canvas is very thick and heavy duty. The removable side pouches are great, being attached with alice clips.Once I put it on an Alice frame and loaded it with all my equipment, I soon realized how comfortable it is for using an Alice frame, it distributes the weight much better than an Alice pack, probably because its wider and taller and doesn't stick out off your back so far."
4,A good beginners guide,AutoCad 2007 No experience required is a great guide for beginning to learn CAD. The instructions are easy to follow and the repetition of principles gives you a sure foundation to build upon.
2,Nothing new here,"This book is simply a compilation of ""senior discounts"" from chains and franchises from around the country. If you didn't already know that AAA and AARP can get you discounts everywhere from Arby's to Zoos then you might find this book useful. For everyone else it's content is easily summed up - ask for a senior discount everywhere! (And they're hardly ""unbelievable"" - think 10%)."
2,Brazen virtue,"Definitely not one of her best, but as one of the first novels in this genre, it shows the promise of her more recent works."
5,recyled text,Nora Roberts is an excellant story teller and it is nice to see some of her older books being republished but buyer beware this is a republished older book
5,Brazen Virtue,"Very engaging and keeps you on edge how everything would play out. I liked the whole plot, each character played out very well."
2,Bedtime for the Kennedys...,"A slab of raging hardcore punk, the Dead Kennedy's final album, ""Bedtime for Democracy"", is probably in many ways a response to the disasterous affair conduceted during the investigation of ""Frankenchrist"". Whereas that album reached through different forms and really expanded the vocabulary of the band, musically, this one focuses on aggressive punk sounds, and doesn't really settle down until halfway through the record. But the pace and intensity picks back up and pretty much sustains for the rest of the album (the exception being Biafra's spoken ""A Commercial"", absolutely brilliant in its sarcasm).The net result is I'm always inclined to feel this is really the weakest album in the Dead Kennedys' catalog. Mind you, had it been a different band, I'd've rated it higher, but compared to the earlier material, it really pales."
5,For the hardcore DK fans,"The prior negative reviews are bringing out the stereotype, that punks are narrowminded and only prefer one type of sound, and they should in no way be taken seriously. When Dead Kennedys experiment with the issues that mattered instead of their old realistic horror punk, with minor hints at some pressing issues, it brings a new refreshing look thst any hardcore DK fan will love this CD."
4,DK at their craziest,"This album starts out good and ends well, but in the middle, half the songs are crap except songs like Cesspools in Eden. I would still buy this CD though for the beginning and the end...also Dear Abby is funny as hell!! You can't understand the lyrics if you just listen to it but read the booklet."
4,One of Jello and Co.'s best!,Your basic Dead Kennedys hardcore riffage returns in a great album definitley a great starting point for people just gettin' into them. Highly endeard by all DK fans.
5,Fix the titles,"Track two of this Album is ""Hop with the Jet set"". Not ""Hope with the Jet Set"". The meaning is changed dramaticly with one letter.It's a fantastic Album, and I find it annoying that the sellers could care so little about it - not to bother checking to see if the titles of the songs are correct.This album makes social statements that are even more relevant today than they were when it was released. It's in the lyrics that the beauty of this work shines; powerful social commentary for a people who have been taught from childhood to admire the screwed up system that oppresses us.The five stars are for a shining work of courage and truth. The MP3 album needs to be corrected, please list it with the care and attention to detail that the original album was published with."
4,Warm and durable but,"The tights are warm and durable but they run large and have no tags, which is a problem with my three granddaughters."
2,You get what you pay for,"Although the tights are very nice when first removed from the package, they don't look so great after just a few washings. They tend to pill and pull. On top of that, the ""navy"" blue doesn't come even close to matching the traditional uniform navy blue. The tights are actually somewhere between navy and royal. Sorry, but just not as impressed as the other reviewers."
4,Wrong category,"This is a good book, but if you are looking for a Princess Diana book, this is not one."
3,Only 3 Episodes?,"Our girls love the Backyardigans, and we have collected all the dvds. They always love watching the show when it comes on Treehouse, and when we're traveling they play the dvd's in the van.So I know a thing or two about the show and the dvd series. And each dvd has always had two hours worth of Backyardigans. Either four single episodes, or a double-length two parter and two single episodes.This dvd is only 90 minutes long. Three single episodes. Collectors get to pay full price for 3/4's worth of value. Forget the ""bonus"" material - it's annoying. If that show was worth anything, people would buy it without being coerced in this way. It's certainly not the new ""Wiggles"" or anything.However.... the 3 episodes are still great. I'd hate to recommend not buying this, because these shows are quite engaging and entertaining, and are not inferior in terms of typical Backyardigans quality.Enjoy the three episodes, but skip over the stupid bonus at the end."
1,Stay away from this one!!,"My 2 sons (19 months and 4) love the Backyardigans and I even enjoy watching episodes with them before bedtime. We own several of the DVDs and keep about 20 episodes saved on our DVR. When this one came out, I ordered it right away as I've done with all their recent releases. However, both me and my sons were bitterly disapointed to find out that it only has 3 episodes (and no double length one as some with only 3 do) and a ""bonus"" episode of the Fresh Beat Band which Nickelodeon has been trying to shove down everyone's throats for months now. It is a horrible show that makes me want to open a vein. There are a dozen WONDERFUL Backyardigans DVDs out there, don't waste your time with this one."
2,Fresh Beat Band Sours This DVD,"Two stars because of the lack of a fourth Backyardigans episode. I have nothing against the Fresh Beat Band, but it should not be on a Backyardigans DVD. Let's hope Nick Jr. doesn't repeat this mistake."
5,Joan Baez has nothing on Sally with this album,"Sally out did herself on this album! Everyone in our family loves this album from our 8 month old grandson to our 77 year old uncle! The songs are wonderfully melodic and exquisitely done. The songs are fun to dance, dream and sing to. This is a must have in everyone's collection."
5,2000 RITA???,I just finished this book and after only 50 pages I was thinking this will be next year's RITA award winner!!!! I loved it read fast and was really enjoyable. I was sad when I finished because I wanted to spend more time with the main characters Sam andJack.
2,"utter cheese, and not to good kind","""She seemed the kind of woman no man could tame, the kind of woman no man in his right mind would want to tame. The kind of woman he had no business thinking about taming.""That about says it all. Read at your own risk, but be careful, your cringeing face may get stuck that way."
1,"Sick Premise, Bad Idea","The whole premise of this and other ""joke"" books about uses for a dead body of anything is sick. So some people don't like cats; some don't like dogs, or lawyers, or whom/whatever. ""Joke"" books about them are categorically not funny. How do you think the public would react to ""101 Uses for A Dead Jew"" or ""101 Uses for a Dead Democrat/Republican""? See how *bad* an idea that is? It's the same for dead people of any category or description, and for animals and anything else that lives.Maybe a book like this is necessary for one group, though: ""101 Uses for Dead People Who Think the Idea of Disrespectfully Using the Dead Bodies of Anything is Funny""."
3,Classic animal humor book,"The cartoons are ok, not laugh-out-loud, and the illustrations don't work for me. I got the book for a cat owner who had other cat humor books. This book gets credit for being one of the first in this genre, published way before other similar books came out."
2,no HEPA filter,thought I was getting the HEPA filter for the side of the vacuum since it was in the picture (green bag) but all you get is the round filter and the entire filter holder which I didn't need. I was disappointed
1,Did not receive all parts,"My review is exactly the same as the other person that gave this 1 star. Nothing wrong with the product, but I was NOT sent the whole kit, rather only the outter filter. When I called amazon, they told me I would have to send this one back and get sent a new kit. Because this company is in the marketplace, they can't give a refund or just send a new one. I don't have time to deal with the inconvenience, so I'll just order from another company in the future."
5,"""BIG SOUL"" from ma boyz The Rolling Stones!","I was 17 when ""OUT OF OUR HEADS"" was released in '65 & I've been a ruined man ever since! Heh-heh-yep, I've never been the same. I played that LP till the grooves were nearly gone! That intro to ""MERCY MERCY"" is still one o' Keith's best. If yer a true Stones fan you should definitely own the first 6 Stones albums. Mostly tasty covers of R 'n' B/Soul/50's Rock'n'Roll. Our boys had many mountains yet to climb, but, in '64 & '65, they delighted us with a raw, rhythmic, rockin' sound that still stands the test of tyme. By 'em all NOW!: 1. ENGLAND'S NEWEST HITMAKERS 2. 12 X 5 3. THE ROLLING STONES NOW! 4. OUT OF OUR HEADS 5. DECEMBER'S CHILDREN 6. HIGH TIDE & GREEN GRASS. Can I get an AMEN!?!PS - ""DONCHA PANIC, DONCHA PANIC, GIMME ONE MO' TRY!"""
4,Out Of Our Heads - a new era,"Out Of Our Heads began a new era for the Rolling Stones. The songwriting team of Jagger/Richards kicked into gear with the classics Satisfaction, The Last Time and Play With Fire. But this album is also loaded with great material such as Mercy Mercy, That's How Strong My Love Is, Good Times, The Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man and The Spider and the Fly. It's also got good filler tracks like Hitch Hike, Cry to Me, One More Try and the noisy live track I'm All Right. Essential album for a Rolling Stones fan."
5,Gets Into Your Head,"Out Of Our Heads contains the strongest original material from the band's first few albums released between 1963-1965. Of course ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"" tops the list and with it's fuzz guitar riff, it is one of the most memorable songs in history. ""Play With Fire"" shows off a more mature edge. The covers they choose are consistently on target including the menacing ""The Spider & The Fly"", the powerful ""That's How Strong My Love Is"" and ""Mercy, Mercy"". Heads marks a major leap by the Jagger-Richards songwriting team and the band was really starting the gel."
1,i don't get it!,"i waited patiently for this book to come out in paperback, but when i finally got to read it i was dissapointed. the story is trite and unfunny, and i had a hard time feeling any sympathy at all for the characters. like the reader from boston, i refuse to keep it on my bookshelf."
2,Quite a few mistakes in this book . . .,"keep me from rating it any higher. Olga is occasionally noted as being the oldest daughter of Alexander III; several pages later she's identified as the youngest (which she is). People in the pictures are also mis-identified. While the text is fairly entertaining, don't read this book for factual information. Still, probably a must-read for Romanov addicts."
3,Excellent Macro Lens - no AF switch on it,"I have Nikon D60 and I wanted a good and not too expensive macro lens. The Sigma 150mm did the work! Great Sharpness, professional and not too heavy.The lens I received did not have the AF/MF switch. I'm going to replace the lens through Amazon's support. They already sent me a new one.I recommend to check that you have this switch when you receive the lens - I don't know why they send a different model.I'll try to add some pictures I took with it."
4,Difficult to use,"I am a beginner in using SLR. I used this lens to take several photos of my watch. this lens will hunt around for about 2 times if you set it to full focus range. The viewfinder looks reasonably bright. HSM is silent, seems to be silent than my Canon 50 F1.4 USM. However, this lens is SUPER difficult to use. It is a 150mm Macro lens. The depth of field is so short when focusing close and at F2.8. How short is that? just take a look with the watch photo i uploaded. (the 3 hands are just about total thickness of 1mm ...) So, if you want to have decent depth of field, you need to narrow it down to about F11 or even smaller. You will need a tripod in this case... And, Even slight movement of flowers caused by wind will make it out of focus... ( I actually use AI-servo when using this lens to take flowers~!) Don't spend money on this lens unless you are a pro in macro photography. Wait for the 70-200 Macro..."
1,Uncritical Acceptance of any Documentary source,"Michael Quinn is an amazingly complex and enigmatic figure--as with most of his work, this book reflects his own often-skewed view of Mormonism and its history. Had the Salamander Letter of Mark Hoffman not been proven a forgery, the book's thesis MIGHT hold some water, but without it . . . Well, it crumbles without it. Lots of research here, but the conclusions do not appear to follow from the evidence-- rather, this is a case where Quinn yet again brought certain presuppositions to the ""evidence"" and thus reached conclusions that a) need not follow from his premises, and b) have little to do with what Mormonism is all about, today or in its early history."
5,This is esential for Studentology.,"I keep this book on my shelf, so it is handy. NO tricks will ber played on me by Mormon Magic."
4,"Scholarly and fascinating, but with some unfortunate polemics.","Quinn's study on the influence of the Magic World View on the first generation of Mormons is original and captivating. It is scholarly and valuable. This second edition, however, is rife with polemics as Quinn attempts to refute allegations made against him by self styled apologists, but, to be fair, he is only dishing back what was dished out to him (or should we say meting out that which was meted unto him?). This kind of tit-for-tat should have more appropriately been kept separate from his thesis, evidence, and argumentation. Quinn's study is most valuable for the vast amount of evidence he provides; even if you don't agree with his conclusions, the evidence is fascinating and deserving of an explanation."
1,Bullet in the Head,"The movie is fantastic, an asian version of the ""Deer Hunters"". The ""Blu Ray"" is an insult. Worse quality than the previous DVD and even worse than the video copy. This borders on fraud as ""Blu Ray"" is a technical standard with a minimum quality guarantee. Moreover the item was sold at a price suggesting a Criterion treatment.Any honest seller would refund, withdraw the item from sale or at least issue a warning as to the abysmal quality of the print."
5,Very informative and entertaining,"If you are a fan of Mark Donohue, or a racing fan from the era of the CanAm series, I believe you will enjoy this biography. It has enlightened me to the complications and hardships in preparing and maintaining a proper race car. There is much insight into the business side off the sport as well, and demonstrates Roger Penske's determination and acuity in running a top flight team."
1,A shallow book,"Like all the books put together by this author (far too many), this alleged biography of Thelonious Monk is a shallow cut-and-paste mishmash sprinkled with clueless (sometimes senseless) observations that alone reveal a lack of perception. This silly book has no valid place on the shelf of jazz literature."
1,Does not work on hard packed snow.,We tried this out at a winter scout camp where the hill was hard packedsnow and it was worthless. My kid had to borrow another sled. It has two black runners on the bottom of the tube which do not slide well on snow.If the run was solid ice it might work better. Very disappointed.
4,Short on literature,"Drumbeat e-commerce is a powerful e-commerce and asp design tool but unfortuantely comes with very little, not to say too little literature on how to put the aspects of the site together. The asp elements are well explained but the e-commerce tasks and instructions come in a brief guide that doesn't answer all questions relative to building an e-commerce application. If it wasn't for this lack of instructions in the user's guide, which Microsoft is well known for, I would have given the software five stars. Think about buying Drumbeat for Dummies to complete the product."
5,GREAT book for first-time triathlete,"This book takes a sane, low-key approach to triathloning. The author did his first one when he was about 45. Very well written, with detailed training plans and lots of interesting anecdotes. HIGHLY recommended"
3,For Novices Only,"This was a well-written book but it is not for those who are in any way competitive. It was written from the perspective of a back-of-the-packer, actually mostly a dead-last finisher and this is fine, as long as you also have the same ambitions: to finish dead last and not care. For those interested in taking up the sport and have never done any physical activity before this is a great book, it will give you the confidence to start and achieve your goals. One day if you decide that just finishing is no longer good enough then you can buy the Triathlon Training Bible (which you probably should have done in the first place) and continue to improve.I have never run a triathlon and do have limited time to train but I returned this book after I bought it because it simply aimed far to low for me. Not a bad book, but it is for a bare novice at sport, let alone triathlon, at best."
5,ALL YOU NEED TO GET STARTED,"The book delivers as promised!When I finished the plan (taking you from SLOW running gradually increacing intensity over weeks and weeks), I was ready for my first Triathlon - The San Jose International - a 3/4 mile swim, 20 mile bike and a 6 mile run. No, I didn't win of course, but I finished! The process was so gradual, I KNEW I could do it every step of the way...What a great feeling! I lost ove 30 pounds of fat in the process, too! This is the ONLY kind of training I have ever STUCK with!I am about to do a HALF Ironman his weekend (TBF Half Ironman in Sacramento).None of this ever would've happened if it weren't for me picking up this book..."
2,Carol Channing meets Little Orphan Annie,"That's the only way I can describe this. Or, this description might help too: imagine a tiny elf belting out a Broadway song during a Wicca celebration. Or... wait, I've got it! It's the woman who says ""Go Into The Light"" in that movie Poltergeist, except now she's singing at a Riverdance concert.Seriously though, I'm not going to say this music has no merit, it's just that the voice is an EXTREMELY acquired taste. The harp playing is nice."
3,great music but vocaly marmite,she is the marmite of music i saw her support (smog) on tour last year brought the album as i enjoyed the harp playing but after meeting her afterward and she spoke completley diffrent to how she did on stage i was a bit off put as it seems her vocal style maybe 'put on' slightly i don't play it as often as i would've liked to because of that and it can become irratating...i also noticed often she starts singing it sounds quiet nice then it's almost like the enthusiam to be 'different' takes over (unlike what the other reviewer said about her and bjork i dont think she sounds anything like bjork i would suggest more like Victoria williams and her lyrics also have the same quirky appeal) but the basics are she's not for everyone this one!!
4,Perfectly Beautiful,"This is one of the rare occasions that I've been moved to write about someone as special as this individual. Until last night, I had never heard of her. I was listening to a local college radio station and I heard this most unusual singing voice. She was singing ""The Book of Right-On"". It sounded very child like and pure. As I listened to the lyrics, I was knocked over by her distinctive singing voice. The lyrics weren't bad either! Anyway, she has now been added to my collection of great sounding vocalists."
4,Tough enough but far from finger-friendly.,"I purchased this shock-proof Panasonic after disappointments with all brands of cheaper thirty-dollar players. I've had it for only six months and see it's been pulled, so maybe there are problems with the model which I have yet to discover.It's a tough, hardy, water-resistant player, and the hand-strap is indeed extra insurance against droppage if you plan to take it with you for walks, etc. The primary limitations are lack of any sort of illumination (pretty much true of all portable CD players) and the flat, rubbery, poorly-designed controls (which taper into increasingly tiny surface areas, so that hitting ""advance"" requires tiny fingers with micro-management precision). Needless to say, the player is far from ideal for those ""night walks."" In fact, there's no way a manufacturer can justify selling these for above fifty bucks and hope to offer a competitive alternative to iPod-type players."
3,hex shaper,its really much smaller than i'd would have liked but all and all its cool. i bought it to make hex hamburger patties. but they are too small. when you buy make sure you get the size you really want.
2,Didn't meet expectations,"I thought this ""study guide"" would be much more descriptive and comprehensive. If you really have a term paper due tomorrow and haven't read the book for yourself, this WILL NOT HELP YOU."
2,Chilly Winter's Turning,"To me, this record is by far the coldest album that Robin has produced - it contains no work of his own and although all tunes & songs are performed as expertly as ever, it lacks the warmth & feeling that graces his other work, partly caused, perhaps, by the instruments used. The rendition of traditional work on his recent albums is much more communicative & far more human - although I still prefer his own gems.This ""Winter's turning"" feels like a chilly, chilly wind blowing, and if there are inky scratches showing on the cd surface, it's not from frequent use.Hans Wigman"
4,Good Read,I really enjoyed this novel. I've read the whole series and I wasn't disappointed. Slightly typical historical romance but liked how she handled the relationship.
5,Excellent Devotional--a great supplement to scripture,My wife and I read one every night before bed. Joni has great insight and the writings are comparable in their scope and depth to the Oswald Chamber's collection.We are on our 2nd time around. A scripture is the theme of each daily writing.
2,Spend a little more money,"This product is the cheapest available of it's kind (as of the time of this review). You should seriously consider a more expensive model if you don't want to be disappointed with the quality. The key pad doesn't light up; it only glows in the dark and it doesn't glow very well at all. The lock I bought didn't even work after I installed it. The brass finish is easily scratched. If you do buy it, test it before you install it. I would suggest that you buy a model that has mechanical buttons and a mechanical dead bolt handle. After all, if you have a hand free to push the buttons you can turn the dead bolt and you will not have to worry about replacing batteries. My church has a mechanical one and it works great."
2,Unnecessary remix,"Syleena Johnson - ""Guess What (Guess Again) Remix"" (Jive, 2003)This remix is mediocre and you have no idea what Syleena or R. Kelly (who sings in here as well as produced/wrote this song) are talking about. The original, also produced and written by Kelly, is much better. Actually, Syleena Johnson remixes are never good except for the Hi-Tek remix of ""Hit on Me"" with Mos Def. -EJR"
4,Delightful psychedelic hijinks..,"A taste of supreme psychedelia, and one of my fave Stones albums for songs like the punchy 'Connection', the wonderfully bileful 'All Sold Out', and the deceptively Dylan-esque 'Who's Been Sleeping Here?'. It may have a couple of low points, but if the Stones had continued creating in this vein, they might've been able to musically outbid even the Beatles in the 'summer of love'."
4,Good Early Stones Album,"I'm really more of a fan of stuff like Beggers banquet and Exile on Main Street but still, this is a pretty good album. I love how Mick Jagger was always so cynical about love in these early songs, hes always getting dumped or leaving some poor girl, always getting hurt or hurting his girlfriend. The only song not like that on this album is She Smiled Sweetly and he just doesn't sound like himself. Something Happened to Me Yesterday is a great song about taking LSD for the first time, Ruby Tuesday is one of their best songs,I think I read somewhere that its about a groupie. Cool, Calm , Collected is a neat, though rather different song. This album is one of the best albums of the mid sixties but its really not at all like their later albums, its more poppy, but still its a pretty good album and has a nice carnaby street sixties feel to it."
2,Pedestrian effort,"This album like most of the Stones work seems to strive for that elusive level of rock genius obtained by the Beatles on almost every release.Mick and Keith are OK song writers but cant match it with the likes of the rock gods,Lennon/McCartney/Harrison.This however has its nice moments but really all it demonstrates is that the Stones were a poor imitation of the mighty pop/rock lords,but then in the '60s who wasnt,even now I suppose we have Oasis and Blur. The ""all you need is love"" video says it all IMO,Mick and Keith sitting at the feet of Lennon,McCartney and co,kinda like they arent worthy or something!"
3,a little too used,book was really used but they refunded my shipping upon my return of the book which is excellent service...
2,Not Impressed,"I thought it was a typical mediocre sitcom, nowhere approaching the quality of Doc Martin. It was very disappointing for a British series."
1,not that great,the paint just was not as good as i hoped it would be. if you get this paint marker set you will need Enamel.
2,Does not whistle and alert you,"One star for cuteness and another star for paying $20 and about $6 shipping. If I had purchased in a store at any price, I would have returned it. If you need a tea kettle to alert you your water is boiling...this is not the tea kettle! It SOMETIMES gives you a VERY LOW medical device flat-line hum. Yes, a tad eerie as another reviewer wrote. The handle can get hot on occasion. Too bad...this is the third tea kettle I've purchased. The other two were returned. Oh...a plus is no sharp edges except for the spout. The ergonomics of pouring water out is decent. Spout is kinda wide so there can be some spillage if you don't control the flow volume. It's black inside so tough to see if the hardwater has built up so just use baking soda and vinegar daily to keep the enamel from corroding (what happened to us before)."
1,"Easy to read, but quickly broke.","I got this clock for outside so I know when to go in each morning to get ready for work. The size of the numbers are great. I'm not sure how accurate the Hygrometer and Thermometer are - they seem be off from what NOAA's website says, but that isn't a huge deal to me.... I mostly just use the clock. Very attractive too.***UPDATE*** Since my original review on 1/1/10, it became obvious that the thermometer is not accurate... it shows about 20 degrees higher than what it is. Even still, I was ok with the clock b/c I really wanted it for just the clock. Now, the clock has stopped working too. I only got about 5 months use out of this clock. Lowering my original rating of a ""4"" to a ""1"" due to this."
5,USE FRESH BATTERIES!!!,"Great clock BUT at initial set up you must use new, fresh batteries. Do not skimp by using batteries found in a drawer or taken from the TV remote!!!!"
4,Immune support!,I have been taking this through the fall and winter so far. I have not been sick though everyone around me has been. I guess it works!
5,Meaningful Book for Experienced or New Educationrs,"I bought this book based on the positive reviews here and was deeply rewarded. This book lays out a clear method and philosophy towards building a caring and safe classroom. The book offers separate parts for the K-2, 3-4, and 5-6 self contained classroom. What was most remarkable to me about this book was the way it struck a balance between being a teaching ""cookbook"" and a straight book of philosophy. Definitely recommended for any new or even experienced educator in a self contained elementary school classroom."
1,there are far better options,"I bought this for a recent trip from Cape Town to Kruger National Park. I was immediately struck by the number of typos and outright errors, the strange organization of the maps, and the inclusion of arbitrary and useless ""helpful facts"" on each page. I'm used to a pretty high standard of road atlas from Frommer's or Michelin, and this is nowhere close.On our first day in South Africa, we were able to find far superior road atlases. The best was the road atlas published by AA, South Africa's version of AAA; also good was the MapStudio road atlas. Both will serve you far better if you're interested in such minor details as roads, cities, and distances."
5,"GOD, I LOVE THIS STUFF","OMG, this is such incredible stuff. Served hot during the winter, with just a bit of milk and sugar, it goes down SO easily. It's addictive. I order it every three months and I make a point of keeping it in stock. If you love root beer, you'll love this flavor. Order early and often!!"
5,Essential Reading,"The most powerful thing about this book is watching the evolution of Malcolm X's ideas as the book progressed. He struggles through his transformation from hardline backer of Elijah Muhammed of the Nation of Islam, through his confusion about Mr. Muhammed's seeming lack of knowledge of the Islam of the Middle East and Mr. Muhammed's possible hypocrisy, to a place of desiring a society where people of all colours could acknowledge and respect one another.Most people are made aware of Malcolm's strong demands for the blacks of America to have their own separate nation. However, you can read as he discards this belief for one, not of integration, but rather mutual recognition and respect between all people.Bearing witness to this powerful transformation was itself a powerful experience."
3,BIOGRAPHY of MALCOLM X,"This biography of Malcolm X by Alex Haley was very moving. The most revealing part to me was the epilogue, and the most moving part was when Malcolm X turned away his own brother forever because of his religion. That part made me cry. It also made me realize that Malcolm X must have loved his religion more than his family. How tragic that is.Most of the book showed what a dedicated person Malcolm X had become. He did seem to brag a lot, but he deserved to brag."
2,"Such hatred didn't get you anywhere, now did it Malcolm?","A good example why one should not hate, because if you do you will not succeed as Malcolm X did not succeed. A real disappointment. a poor example of displaying ""change"" and the such. Anger and hate gets you no where, as we can see."
5,The best analysis of Malcolm X,"People have made numerous attempts to analyze, classify and form theories about Malcolm X and what he stood for, forgetting that for someone of his caliber, it is not easy to do this. To even attempt to understand Malcolm X, you would have had to know of his life experiences and how they laid the foundation of what he became. This book gives you that information, and most importantly, it is from his point-of-view. That is why I believe this book gives the best analysis of who Malcolm X was and what he stood for. Malcolm X was one of the most inspiring and articulate leaders that has ever lived and this book is a testament of that. This autobiography is very powerful and for anyone looking to learn more about Malcolm X, I cannot tell you of a better place to start."
4,Fine debut,"I actually prefer the UK debut, which is almost the same as this album.The UK album's best song, 'Mona' was deleted in favor of 'Not Fade Away'. 'Mona' had to wait for the following year for US release on the 'Now!' Lp.The UK album cover also featured the photo shot of the band and nothing else, no group name or title, which was quite an innovative idea at the time. London Records threw this idea out the window, by having the group's name feature prominently, along with 'England's Newest Hitmakers', a statement which must have become dated within a week of coming out.Putting that aside, the music's great, I like all the tracks, even the instrumental 'Now I've Got a Witness', a group jam that sounds like it was made up on the spot.'Walking the Dog' was released as a single in Australia, and topped the charts there."
4,Short but helpful read,"Little more than pamphlet size, there is valuable information and comforting answers in this book. Very useful as an introduction for denser books of meaning, like ""Dying to be Free"" or ""Why Suicide"" for someone who has just become ""a survivor."""
2,Disappointing,"I have read a number of books about British executioners includingDiary of a Hangmanby John Ellis, andThe Hangman's Tale: Memoirs of a Public Executionerby Syd Dernley, and I have to say that this book by Mr Fielding was not nearly as interesting as those two. The actual biographical information about the three Pierrepoints, Henry, Thomas and Albert is rather sketchy and most of the book consists of page after page of brief accounts of murders and then a paragrpaho or so detailing the execution of the perpetrators. A few of the murders are interesting accounts of famous cases, but the bulk are sordid and mundane and the accounts of the executions, for the most part, seem to differ only in the weight of the victim and the length of the drop. It is a pity that the author didn't focus on a smaller number of cases and provide a bit more interesting detail for each. As it was, the book quite quickly became repetitious and tedious. I finished it, but I doubt I will read it again."
5,If you are collecting BSB pics this book has tons of them !!,This book has tons of pics and information.It has secrets about each boy ! Trust me this is a GOT TO HAVE !!! It is worth every penny.It has so many pics that I am still finding new pics !!! BSB RULE 4 EVER !!!!!!
1,Rin Tin Tin,"I found this one to be very hard to understand, the words were not clear maybe because the origanal films were so old.Areil"
2,Save your money,"I saw Jakob once at a usability conference and all I can say is ""What a friggin' ego."" The whole beginning of his presenation was a series of slides showing what magazines he's been featured in. It totally eroded any semblance of scholarship I may have once thought he posessed.And if you don't think ego is involved, check out his rates on the neilson/norman consulting site."
3,Rant,"I thought it ironic that a book on usability is such a ridiculous size and shape. Try finding a shelf on your bookcase for a 10"" x 10"" book. It sticks out a good 2"" further than industry standards. While some of this is justified, because of the web screen shots, there is a thick red border on all pages that could have been trimmed to make this book more USABLE.It's kind of like a book on brevity being 3,000 pages..."
5,What a difference!,"Perfect fit on my Schwinn 150, installed in seconds with the draw string and it does feel great on the tush."
3,stationary bike seat cover,"The seat cover helps out alot when riding the bike, at least our fannies do not get soar til at least 30 min into riding the bike."
2,Better than I thought it would be,"I ordered this movie and actually mistook it for ""Hot Resort"" Same year (1985) and almost the same name with a similar setting. Private Resort was pretty good, had it's moments, and just kept you wondering what was going to happen next. It was one of those mid-80s teen on the beach flicks, so watch it if you don't want drama or horror."
3,i remember this!,thats right i saw it when i was little and it was funny and stuff:D i think its pretty good i didnt remember jhonny depp in it but ahhh:D
3,Depp-raved Sex Romp,"If you've ever thought your life would be incomplete without seeing Johnny Depp's wholly unclothed backside and watching him in a slap fight with Rob Morrow and Andrew Dice Clay, then this 1985 romp is not to be missed."
1,What a Dumb Movie!,"As far as I am concerned, there is exactly one good thing about this movie: a young and delicious Johnny Depp. No doubt men will see it differently, given the number of bikini-clad females around. It's Florida, it's spring break, and what do you need with an actual plot? It's basically slapstick and worse, in terms of humor. For example, one big deal is made over a guy whose hair is ""ruined"" by Depp's roommate pretending to be a barber when he is not. Through all the slapstick foolishness, all I could think of was ""What's his problem? Yul Brenner looked great with no hair at all. Just shave off what's left and stop crabbing."" But of course, that wouldn't be nearly as funny.There is one particularly golden moment in the film, just one. Johnny Depp changes his pants. OK, he's facing away from the camera, but still . . . mmmmmmmmmmmm!"
2,Corny movie,"I admit that I'm a die-hard Johnny Depp fan, but this wasn't anywhere near one of his best. He IS adorable in the movie, but the plot is extremely corny, and I found myself rolling my eyes more than laughing out loud. Guys will enjoy this movie for the hundreds of bikini-sporting girls, but not much else. Although there are a few remotely funny parts, it is mostly because of how dorky this movie is. But then again, it was worth it to watch Johnny."
4,"Not the best Agatha, but still worth reading","This hasn't been my favorite book in the Agatha series, but I still had some laugh out loud moments, surprises, and suspense.I read this series because I just love Agatha. The author has made her very real to the reader, very believable as a middle-aged woman in the 21st century.I can't wait to read the newest book in the series, ""Spoonful of Poison."""
2,What a disappointment...........,"I absolutely loved all the other books in this series, but this one was a disappointment. I'm afraid that I might not have read the whole series if I had read this one first. I'm almost tempted to go back and reread the first book to keep my enthusiasm alive.Agatha has mellowed and become almost pathetic. The plot was weak and the usual sexual tension missing in action. The setting offered nothing, except some glimpses of English history that we hadn't seen before. The characters and conversations weren't believable. Or entertaining. Or amusing.I can't believe the author feels this book is of the same calibre as the rest of the series. It is as if someone else wrote it. I hope this isn't a trend...........?"
1,complete idiots guide to understanding catholicism,"Book was in terrible shape, looked like something liquid was spilled all over it. First time I have felt ripped by a used book purchased via Amazon"
4,Good Book for the Sports Fan Who Likes Science,"From start to finish this was a fascinating book. There is also a great deal of football history sprinkled throughout.It does a great job introducing the football portion of the topic, then the physics lesson, and then combines them to understand how the physics principle is implemented in real life. It does take a basic understanding of physics to really grasp the concepts since the book does not go into a great deal of detail on the principles.It starts with the fundamentals of blocking a tackling and you gain a much greater understanding of the forces an NFL player can generate. Then you get to understand the precision required to run a passing and kicking game. I especially enjoyed the section on pursuit angles and maximizing the yardage gain.A very fast read that was very enjoyable."
1,BEWARE--Bad DVD copy,Very disappointing copy of this film. I saw it on TCM as well and it was lovely copy they ran. There must be a way that Amazon ought to be held responsible for not rating the quality of these films when they are as bad as pirated versions.
1,"Very, very light","This is the 1956 comedy with Edward Arnold, John Forsythe, Myrna Loy, Olivia De Haveland, and Tommy Noonan. The script is embarrassingly bad. There are no laughs. The only highlight is the fashion designed by Dior. An exception even to that, however, is the hat worn by Myrna Loy in the early scenes of the film. It looks as though an arrow was stuck in it. For entertainment on any level, this is close to zero. Even the finest actors can't do much with writing of this sort."
5,A DELIGHT!,"Enjoyable and wonderful. Well written, to the point...many anecdotes, but never mean...informative.A great buy. Makes great present to anyone who is even vaguely interested in piano literature or music in general."
4,Beautiful voice,"The only other Soraya CD that I have is ""En Esta Noche."" I can't get enough of her beautiful voice. It is not as good as ""En Esta Noche,"" but good enough to purchase without regret.When I was in Buenos Aires, you could hear this CD being played over the public address systems in stores and restaurants. I also saw her music video from this CD while in Buenos Aires. I wish I could get a copy of that video. It was great."
3,"Joe Brainard, The Friendly Way","Among the several privately printed offset or mimeographed editions by Brainard, this is one of the least interesting, mainly because it is hardly illistrated."
4,Great Stuff,I love this album. Track 2 is impossible to get out of your head.The use of the steel guitar and mandolins and kinda twangy stuff might turn some people off but I thought it was tastefully done. Think of the Wide awake album and replace the blues influence with country/bluegrass influence.
2,does not work for all telescopes,I was aware from the description that this device would only hold eyepieces up to a certain barrel length. Unfortunately because of the design any eyepiece used is raised another couple inches from the telescope eyepiece holder compared to using it without the adapter. on my telescope this means i do not have enough infocus ability to get the moon or planets into focus. it will obviously work for some telescopes but not all. You would be better off getting a different style adapter that attaches to the top of the eyepiece to allow for the sensor to be closer to the eyepiece and still able to use the eyepiece lower barrel to attach to the telescope.
4,helpful,I bought this for my daughter her sophomore year. The text can be cumbersome for some students. This is probably helpful for most. My daughter did not seem to need it.
1,The Pink Panther should have stayed undercover,"It's infortunate that the rating system doesn't go down to ""0"" stars. This movie is an insult, not only to Peter Sellers, but to the intelligence of anyone who would spend $8.00 to be entertained. The phoney Frence accent wasn't even a caricature of a caricature. Martin sounded more like Madeline Khan in Blazing Saddles than Peter Sellers sounding French. And, if you couldn't see the stupid sight gags and slapstick events coming before they happened, I have some beachfront property in Arizona I'd like you to invest in.It makes you sad that Steve Martin ever left Saturday Night Live."
4,Mom & Teacher,Hard to find video that we wanted for our family movie night and Amazon had it at a very good price!
1,kinda stupid,"uh this movie was ok not the best movie i've seen better though this one was more of a waste of time mostly. it was interesting at first but then it got dumb...dumber...and then it was the dumbest movie ever! i'd say if you want a steve martin movie go rent cheaper by the dozen one or two or planes,trains and automobiles. this was just plain stupid and a waste of time for the cast and crew to make it."
1,There Is No Substitute for Peter Sellers,"You can remake ""The Pink Panther"" ad nauseam, but Peter Sellers is the only Inspector Clouseau - a screen immortal alongside Chaplin's Little Tramp and Tati's Monsieur Hulot. Despite his best efforts, Steve Martin provides a superfluous and painfully unfunny imitation. That's what you get for messing with a classic."
2,Conceived for teenagers,"The hero is a clumsy oaf and unsuccessful with women, spends lonely time on the Internet, but he redeems himself..... clearly the target market for this semi-amusing product is the male teenage crowd who can identify their own problems with those of the protagonist (a similar marketing profile was created for Robin Williams in ""Man of the Year""). There are a few funny sight gags but this is corporate comedy from the boardroom. The phony French accents are to die for (not). OK if you have a couple of hours to kill."
4,Inspector Clouseau Returns in Good Form,Steve Martin returns in one of the best cinematic roles ever created. Inspector Clouseau and his antics have always been the catalyst for outrageous mayhem and fun. This is true to form from Peter Sellers' approach to the role. That is what makes this film so successful and funny. Steve Martin is the third actor to portray Clouseau (the fourth if you include Roger Moore's appearance in CURSE OF THE PINK PANTHER in which Moore may or may not have been Clouseau) on screen.Alan Arkin played him in 1968's INSPECTOR CLOUSEAU in an intentionally dry fashion. Martin returns to Maurice Richlin's character as honed by Sellers and that seems to work very well here.Christophe Beck's score is admirable and he has Henry Mancini's Pink Panther Theme down in a robust elegiac form. Jean Reno is unusually stoic as Ponton.
4,"Martin never equals Sellers, but Martin + Kline comes close!","I was pretty reluctant to view the new film because, I love the original series with Peter Sellers. In my opinion, the first ""Pink Panthers"" are some of the funniest films ever made.While Steve Martin alone does not match Peter Sellers' comedic genius, Steve Martin and Kevin Kline make up a great duo. They were several times when I lost myself laughing uproariously. The film is worth viewing just for the two of them.The plot: France's well-beloved soccer coach is killed just 3 weeks before the French Medal of Honor. The chief Inspector of International Police (Kline) realizes he cannot take the case. So he brings in Clousseau, thus depriving a remote French village of their idiot, and sets him on the case planning to take over at the last minute and solve the crime. To his surprise and undoing, Clousseau stumbles into the solution."
2,Martin was wrong for the part,"Despite being a little better than I expected, it's still not that great. There's some laughs here and there but the movie is still more stupid than it is funny.While, I don't know who told Steve Martin that he'd make a good Jacques Clouseau. He has his usual look but with a brown mustache glued on. In some scenes, it appears that it's falling off his face. White hair with a brown mustache looks pretty silly as well. Kevin Kline looks more the part and could have pulled it off better. Yet, he's only wasted in a supporting role.Martin simply just looks out of place and has been a lot funnier. I do like him as a comedian, I have liked many of his films. I just don't like him in this role. He's totally wrong for the part."
4,Very funny video,"This was bought as a gift. The price was fair and the shipping was quick. The gift receipiant was happy with this video, as he is a big Steve Martin fan."
3,What Happened!!!,I really did not enjoy this until the last part...when they were dressed in disguise to catch the killer and they were dressed in the same design as the drapes...and when they almost got caught and had to act like dancers for the entertainment...that was about the funniest for me in this...not sure if I would see this again!!!
5,Why do we have to compare?,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I laughed all the way through. A friend of mine, to whom English is a second language, thought the sequence where Clouseau tries to lose his accent was hilarious. Why do we have to compare Martin to Sellers? Just take this as a funny comedy. Steve Martin has created his own character. Peter Sellers had his character. If this was a scene by scene remake of the original 60s Pink Panther film, then there would be justification for a comparison. I hope they can come up with a good script for a third film."
3,"We got a few laughs out of it, but this movie is generally a waste of time","This movie was pretty ridiculous. Most of the time we laughed at it, we asked ""Should we really be laughing? This is so stupid.""If it wasn't for the three or four sexual-type jokes, this could be a family movie because the humor was exactly what elementary school kids enjoy."
4,Tickled Pink,"Steve Martin is no Sellersbut this film deserves a lookhe does the role in Martin-stylewith Beyonce as the hookNot all the jokes are funnySome of them fall quite flatThe plot is sometimes paper-thinBut you'll laugh in spite of thatA soccer coach is murderedStuck with a poisoned dartHe's also lost his bling-blingseems at death the two must partChief Dreyfus wants the gloryHe lives only for fameHe picks the bumbling ClouseauSo the fool can take the blameBut when things vary from the planThe Chief has Clouseau trappedHe makes a grand announcementThat he soon will have things wrappedDown but certainly not outClouseau finds one last clueAnd at the Presidential BallHe solves both cases tooBeyonce's bootyliciousClive Owen proves he's BondWith Kevin Kline and Jean RenoThis one's for tout le mondeAmanda Richards, July 15, 2006"
3,"Nice balls, but not white","These seem to be great table tennis balls for the money, but they were definitely orange rather than white, which is what we ordered and wanted."
4,Quite A Romp,"BARFLY is what first brought Buk into my life, so this thinly veiled fictional account of its making was a joy to read. It's a bit goofy in spots (some of the names Buk came up with to represent the real stars he encountered are ridiculous), but classic Buk nonetheless. Why isn't Buk taught in college English classes yet?"
5,A LEGEND,Fantastic information in this book full of Wisdom. Interesting to hear about his struggles and his adventures. He also appreciated his friends. God Bless this Great Actor!!
5,GREAT MOVIE FOR A MIDDLE SCHOOL MATH CLASS!,"As a math teacher for the past 10 years, I can honestly say there is not much out there in the way of educational math movies worth showing in the classroom. That being said, Flatland is a great ""cartoon"" which presents the idea of different dimensions in an entertaining and clear way (obviously, the movie is much simpler than the book, but that is what makes it great for middle school age children). It was a great spring board for discussion within my classroom! I will be showing this movie for years to come! Worth every penny!"
1,Terrible,"3-stars? Don't make me laugh. I've had this for about two weeks and four of the six balls are already finished. These balls are particularly soft, it's easy to tell when compared with my Joola 1-star balls. While my ONE STAR Joola balls have had one broken ball in about 5 months of playing, I've had four of these Halex three star ones break on me in less than two weeks! Maybe I just got a terrible batch, but judging by how soft these balls are(just apply a little pressure with your thumb, compared to say the Joola 1-star balls, and you'll feel how soft they are), I think they're just poorly made."
2,Very Poorly Worded Product Title,"Halex Fusion 6-Pack 3-Star Tennis Balls (Orange) is the item. You you think nice fuzzy balls. You would be wrong, these are TABLE Tennis Balls. More commonly known as ping pong balls. Waste of my time, expense and effort. Waste of sellers resources too. Too bad."
4,Better than I thought!,"I've looked at the other reviews of this book, and the Look Inside feature. And boy, I want this book! I'm a veteran teacher in many settings, but have only set up my own classroom three times in fourteen years. I'm back in a generalist classroom of my own for the first time in nearly ten years, and while it's some stuff I have thought of on my own, the validation of explicitly thinking about these interior design issues is valuable in and of itself. The author's writing is clear and gives examples without being so anecdotal the content loses sequence."
5,Early Jewish Reading,"This book is the first chapter book to interest my six year old. The characters, five sisters, each have their own personalities which are drawn in detail and carried through all of their adventures. The stories are sweet, focusing on everyday life in a poor jewish family at the turn of the century in New York (on the lower east side). The traditions will be familiar to an educated jewish reader but the setting just diferent enough to make it interesting. My daughter demands it every night and now cant sleep without her nightly dose of ""naughty Henny and her sisters."""
1,Unhappy with this product,I was very disappointed with the quality of these Juniper Berries. They dry and hard and had no aroma or taste.
4,Almost Perfect,"I love this fragrance. I ran across it by chance and was interested initially because of its unique name, but soon I found that I adored it.It is a romantic scent but not so much so that it should be reserved specifcally for dates or encounters with a loved one. I wear mine almost everyday. I wear it to work, out with freinds, just about everywhere. It has a nice clean flowery scent that's not overbearing or nauseating as some perfumes can be. The only complaint that I have is that at times I wish the ""perfumey-ness"" of the scent were a tad bit more subtle. Halloween is my favorite fragrance and I would highly recommend it."
1,UNBELIEVABLE,THERE WERE CRACKS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE TABLE AND A 5 INCH CHIP OUT OF THE WOOD I HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT TO ORDER ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY
3,A love/hate situation,"If you want to read about characters that you won't like who do absurd things, then this is the book of you. It's redeeming grace is the fact that it is beautifully written. The characters are so well described that you know what they are thinking without anything being said."
1,This is the worst book ever!,"This is the stupidest,far-fetched, ridiculous romance novel I have ever read. I was angered that I wasted my time reading this junk that is passed off as a novel. It was boring, silly. and totally uninteresting. If you enjoy stories about underground cities and ghosts telling the characters what to do you may enjoy it, if you want passion, great dialouge, a romance and excitment, skip this book."
3,McD gets screwed again,"McLibel is a little like Super Size me, where McD is uncovered for its practices and food. The big corporation sues activists for libel in Britain, and instead of giving in, the activists take it to court. It makes you think about big corps and where their priorities are."
5,Chloroform,This CD is great fun. Graham is back in form and it's a killer.I can't beleive they are not playing Chloroform on the radio....doh.. Yes I can the radio sucks. Put it on the airwaves it would be a commercial hit....STANDING OVATION to GP!!!!!!!
4,Great CD for karaoke wannabes!,"Yes, this is a musical compilation of movie songs you know so well that you can probably sing them in your sleep. So if you're looking for a compilation of movie tunes sung by the original artists, look elsewhere. However, if you'd rather sing these songs without competing against the original singers, then this is a good CD to have. And you'll be amazed at just how well you remember the lyrics to most of these songs once the music starts."
4,Great 70-218 overview,"Very readable. Concise. A great overview. Given the price, a great value.Certification seekers: If you have a lot of real-world experience this will be useful in pointing out what you haven't had to deal with but will be on the test. Those taking classes to prepare will find this a much more pleasant review than slogging through the Microsoft Press book again. Useful for those taking the 70-215 test as well, as the 70-218 rehashes many concepts begun in 70-215.Possible improvements:If the CD tests were expanded/enhanced, value would be even greater.In the text: Need more ""On the Test"" mentions."
4,Step by Step pointers,"I found this book to be both educational and exciting. Philip Holland takes you through a step by step process of what is going to take and what you need to keep in mind for starting up your own business. Holland touched down on particulars which I hadn't even considered until reading this book. This book will take will demonstrate formulas for cash handling, budget balancing, obtaining loans, and more. The only reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is because this book is a little old. But it doesn't dwell in principles of a market trend. It stays true to timeless technics which will help you set up foundation and operation of a budding entrepreur's first business."
1,Disappointed,"This book was rated in good condition, but it is so fragile the pages break from the spine when turned and pages are brittle. I consider this book to be in fair condition only."
3,Good for beginners,Good learning book for beginners in digital photography. Not very helpful if you've been doing this for a while.
5,Amazing Results!,"Hooked on Phonics Learn to Read is a wonderful way to spark a child's love for reading! It offered a motivation for our son using both the progress charts/stickers and a gradual change in the level of difficulty that we could not find elsewhere. He successfully completed the Kindergarten Edition and is now reading the chapter books in the 1st grade HOP program with confidence. The stories have all been age appropriate with wonderful content. Thanks to HOP, we feel ready for our 1st grade year!"
2,"The screen quality is great, *except* for dead pixels","Sony support is unresponsive, and it's been declared an unavoidable issue with manufacturing, apparently. ""This is just the way the technology is."". Well, I have purchased dozens of LCDs from other vendors at my company. Only one had this problem, a Dell, and it was immediately replaced by the vendor. They sent me a new one and I sent the old one back in return packaging they provided. Sony will not do this. They will at most let you fill out an RMA, where you will pay for the shipping, and they ""may or may not return it with the same issue."".What? That's not acceptable."
5,Apple Seeds Hollywood,"This book offers a fascinating record of the interaction between art and technology, artist and corporation. It describes in thorough detail the logistsics of shooting and editing a feature film from start to finish using a totally untried and discouraged software and hardware tool chain formerly for amatuer efforts only.The meeting of Silicon Valley and Hollywood industries creates a riveting plot that is hard to put down. The gorgeous graphic layout and attention to detail also help.Only grumble was the detachment of one page from the binding, but if you don't sleep next to your copy, it probably won't be a concern.Anyone interested in cutting edge (hah!) technology and/or legendary Bay area genius Walter Murch must read this book."
4,Interesting,I rather enjoyed reading this ebook. It has suspense enough to keep you reading faster to get to the end.
4,Perfect for beginners,"Yeah I am writing a review on this product... Oh well, I can only tell you what my wife thinks of it, and this is the only one we have tried that does not bother her. It is small so for those of you wanting something bigger than an average finger, need to look at others.This is a good warm up device for those looking to work into that type of play. It also moves the guy in a different postition when used.The only problem I have with this one is that the base is curved and hollowed (so to speak). Depending on your size and posisiton, this could rub you wrong.Not a bad buy though, would recommend."
2,my first mug,"I love that it's big. I felt that the insulating quality was poor. My cup would occasionally come apart. The inside of the mug is plastic, that has me worried about the plastic leaching into my coffee. there was an occasion in witch I washed the cup in the dishwasher, filled with water and took a drink my water tasted a little like coffee. I am looking for a stainless mug now ."
3,Shame about the handles...,"Listen, the price is right, and they look nice enough. They also hold plenty of coffee (or whatever) and still fit in my car cup holder. BUT I really don't like the handles. More than the other reviewers I read. They are really bendy and I feel like they can barely support the weight of the empty mug, never mind full. Again -- you get what you pay for, I get that, but still the handles could be MUCh better"
5,Nice BIG Travel Mugs,"I purchased these for my husband after somebody at work stole the one he had for many years. He does not like any moving parts on the lid, so these were perfect.The price is great. They hold a lot and keep the coffee warm for a while.He's very pleased with them and put his name on it this time.We'll see if that helps any.We would not hesitate to purchase them again or recommend them."
3,REliving my childhood,"I was so amazed at how well the sets, models and some of the special effects held up. It was truly beautiful. The stories however... Well this was made for kids and I got it to relive my childhood."
5,this is still a wonderful show for kids and adults,I remember watching this great saturday morning show as a kid and loveing it. this is one show that still holds up well and my kids love it. thanks to bci eclipise for finding it and getting it out for a new generation to see.
4,A More Palatable Explanation of Possession,"I really loved this book and found it very intriguing.Dr. Edith Fiore presents a more plausible explanation for possession: ghosts influencing the living rather than demons. When one considers Dr. Fiore's findings concerning attachment/possession, biblical passages of Jesus casting out spirits seem to make more sense. Interestingly, this idea is also much more in line with exorcism rituals found within Jewish mysticism called, ""Kabbalah.""If you have an interest in understanding ""ghost possession,"" I highly recommend Dr. Fiore's book which walks the reader through case after case of exorcism through use of compassionate communication.Louis Charles, authorHelping Ghosts: A Guide to Understanding Lost Spirits from Angels & Ghosts (Volume 1)"
4,Creepy but important,"I recommend this book to friends of mine who are in the alternative health field. While I found the whole idea of such common spirit possession pretty creepy, the case studies she described were very impressive. For instance, she believes that spirit possession is always involved in cases of alcohol or drug abuse.While we do find what we call ""attachments"" it's nowhere near the 80% she quotes, but people come to me because they don't feel good, or have a child with autism, not because they think they're crazy.She uses a rather complicated hypnosis process to free her patients of their possessors. But it all follows a logical progression. She believes the person who really needs the therapy is the spirit that is doing the possessing, otherwise, if you clear them out, and don't heal them, they'll just go torture someone else, and that person may not seek help.It is a good introduction into the issue."
2,Funny but crude,"As with most comedians, one doesn't discover their true nature until they are uncensored. I have enjoyed Ms. Sykes immensely on TV and in movies, but found her language and crude humor to be over the top for my tastes in this album. There are some very funny moments in this presentation, but it's not worth wading through the muck to find them."
2,disappointing,Found this book was expensive and totally failed to come to a point. I decided to give up rebirthing as a goal as a result of reading it...
4,Great toy horse...,This was purchased to go into a wood toy barn my husband has made. It is a fun horse. Only complaint is that the girl rider that comes with it doesn't really fit on the saddle correctly and won't stay on. I think the rider is a poor design that should of been a bit wider in the seat and made so the legs of the rider go down around the horse so she stays on the horse.
1,Hanes x Hanes,"I purchased this product, forgetting how much I cannot stand having ""HANES"" stamped accross my toes!!!!!!!!!!! I find myself cringing when even thinking about wearing them. I'll have to find a friend to pawn them off on."
1,What I Got,Hanes Over The Calf Tube SocksI received the socks I ordered. My mistake.They are very thin compared to the Wigwam Tube Socks and the toe stitching is on the ends which make these socks very uncomfortable.It was my mistake so I am not blaming anyone or the product - I got what I paid for - a pair of cheap socks that I will not wear and the price does not warrant returning them as it would cost almost as much as I paid for the socks - not a good experience for me.
2,Experiment or what ???,"I'm completely disappointed with the music on this ""album"" ... looks more like collection of various strange keyboard sounds... strange music... far away from Progrock .... If you want to hear real Morgan Fisher get Nova Solis... I just wasted my money..."
4,Wire Whip Dishwasher Trick,"I still can't believe that Kitchen Aid can't produce a dishwasher safe wire whip! I'm now on my third whip because eventually I would forget and toss the whip into the DW. That causes the top attachment piece to oxidize, become covered in a black sooty-like substance and drip black water into my batter sometimes no matter how well I'd dried it previously. My ""so far so good"" trick: When I store my wire whip, I put a bright green clothes peg on it. When I take the whip out for use, the peg gets clipped on to the front of the upper rack of my DW. When I am hurrying through cleanup, the peg reminds me not to put the whip in the DW and I immediately turn and hand wash the whip. The clothes peg goes back on and into storage or into the mixer it goes, peg and all, Maybe it's a senior thing, but it sure works for me!!"
1,Utterly disappointed,"Had I know what a cheap imitation of a Kitchen Aid whip this is, I would have never wasted my money. It is the right size, but is in no other way comparable to the original. It is not stainless steel, it came scratched up, and it feels like it will fall apart within the year. I did not want a disposable product, but this one without a doubt will be."
4,It fits my Artisan,"It fits my Artisan and Other than NOT putting in the dishwasher, I have no complaints.Just you need to wash it by hand like many other products, unless you dont mind tarnished material (which I dont)"
3,Good fun!,"Not the best movie out and let's your mind drift to other places at times, but for the most part - enjoyable."
3,It is ok,"This book covers most situations that you would encounter in bending conduit. It gives all the calculations, and plenty of examples. My problem with it is that the wording could be clearer, and the book seems out of order."
2,buy at you owbn risk,"purchased air tank because of the rhino brand name. When I got the item home the initial inspection revealed that it was cheaply made. The first time I used the tank after filling, I couldn't get any air to transfer from the tank to the vehicle tires I was trying to adjust. I then tried to determine why and discovered that the filler hose would not depress the valves on any of the tires. I ended up replacing the filler hose with the one from the air tank I was replacing; now it works fine. I would reccomend you buy a different tank."
4,NLP Core States,I use this book as reference material for NLP core states and it gives a good foundation on the subject.
2,Difficult read,I found the layout and presentation of the book difficult to follow and could not easily see the principles behind the so called technique. It really didn't seem any different than talk therapy to me.
3,It's For Mac Only !!!!!!,"I'm sure this thing works great but just in case it wasn't obvious, it wasn't to me, it will only work on the Mac. The drivers are for the Mac and the Tooldial software is for the Mac. Maybe the blue lights come on if you plug it into a USB port but other than that, it is useless to purchase this product if you own a Windows PC.This is by no means a knock on Mac, it's just that, in my opinion, there should be some sort of extra effort to identify this product will only work on a Mac. I've got Logitech stuff all over my PC (speakers, keyboard, mouse, webcam) and it just never occured to me that the NuLOOQ is MAC ONLY."
5,Keillor Rocks!,"Garrison Keillor does it again! He brings his ""Prairie Home Companion"" style to broadcast a live show from Mark Twain's home in Hartford Connecticut. For people familiar with his ""Prairie Home Companion"" show this show will be familiar except that this time it has a singular subject, Mark Twain. Keillor's love and admiration for Twain shows through as he takes you from room to room with descriptions, stories, and musical performances. I will admit my bias in that I am a fan of the ""Prairie Home Companion"" shows, but people who are familiar with Twain's work and people who are not so familiar alike will learn details about Twain listening to this engaging show. The live radio format lends itself to Twain as it is spontaneous much like Twain himself. If you are planning to visit the Mark Twain House, this program will greatly enhance your experience."
2,A bit outdated,"It is amazing how a book that was useful when it was published becomes obsolete so quickly. Many of the ideas presented are basically OK, but some are definitively ourdated. The Internet and web browsing experiences have change our perceptions of what works and what does not."
3,Somewhat Usable,"If you can get over how arrogant and condescending Nielsen is, you may get some valuable information out of this book. However, Nielsen doesn't practice what he preaches, so follow what he says in the book, not what you see at his website. Nielsen bashes graphic design regarding it as artsy feelings that can be represented elsewhere. Hey Jakob, how useful are those flaps included with the cover of the book??"
1,Shallow on specifics,"A bookful of screenshots does not research make. Sure, this book is full of common senses suggestions for usability, but it sorely lacks detailed references to establish credibility. A statement like ""most people prefer searches"" doesn't carry much weight without as much as a footnote to the actual research. This useful payload of this book could have easily been conveyed in 50 pages.While I wouldn't recommend this read, Web newbies might pick up an idea or two. Anyone with any sense of Web design should spend their reading time elsewhere."
4,Layout left much to be desired,"The content of the book was very useful, but the paragraphs were often broken up by up to five pages of graphics which really made it hard for the book to flow correctly. It seemed that Jakob Nielsen did a lot of finger pointing without suggesting any solutions."
3,A little too simple,"For anyone who already has basic knowledge of HCI principles and interface design, this book is rather simple. Nielsen covers topics which may be useful for someone who has never heard of usability...but for most in the field who strive to make usability a part of their designs, this book will be a quick read as it just ""points out the obvious"". I would recommend this book only for people who want an introduction to web site design, not those who want a more in-depth look at real usability issues."
1,Disappointing level of workmanship by publisher,"A good-looking book with lots of illustrations and nice layout concept. Good, commonsense information about what makes a Web page/site easy and pleasant for the user. However, I was really distressed to find glaring proofreading-type errors---given the price of this book, I don't expect captions to be cut off in the middle and important words to be left out of sentences. Mr. Nielsen needs to find a publisher that employs PROOFREADERS. I will be attempting to return it--not because of the content, but because there was such a discrepancy between the price and the workmanship (or lack thereof)."
2,Check out the authors work first,"Check out the authors site ""alertbox"" before buying this book.Does this look like something you'd like to emulate for your site?Not me....If you think plain, boring, unformatted text really makes the Internet a better place then sure, go for it."
1,Above Artists,"If you enjoyed Roger Black telling you how to design for the web, you're going to love this. You're probably also a beaten house-wife.I have witnessed over and over again, the deep heated desire to control creatives. I believe it largely stems from envy. This guy probably had a problem with sound in movies, color television and graphics on web pages.If you want to really learn something about useability, try Edward Tufte.Nice cover design though. I suspect he objected to that as well."
1,Save your money and subscribe to Alertbox,"I have been a huge fan of Jakob Nielsen for years. I am also a subscriber to his Alertbox newsletter (on useit.com).I was looking forward to this book, but alas, found nothing in here that I would classify as new or ground-breaking.If you have never, and I mean never, read a book on web design, then by all means, buy this book. But if you have read anything by Waters, Weinnman, Pirouz, McClelland, Ibanez or Flemming (all excellent writers of web design and technique) then you have covered the topics in this book already.There is no technical, or real design theory here.Search the Useit.com archives and then subscribe either directly or through devhead (ZD Net) and save your money for his next book (of which this is Part I). You'll get the same information for free ;-)"
5,The Book of Disciplinew for Methodist Religon,"The book I ordered came within a week and in outstanding condition.Also the book waas well perserved.Thank YoWayne EicherColumbus, GA 31909"
5,2008 United Methodist Book of Discipline,"This book was in perfect shape and came in a very short period of time. I was pleased with the personal attention to the customer as the seller inserted a thank you letter, with contact information."
5,The Rough Guide First-Time Europe is the item of choice,"If you've never been to Europe before and are looking for an easy starting place to plan a trip, The Rough Guide First-Time Europe is the item of choice: it's a pre-trip guide for destination-bound visitors and covers everything from planning an itinerary and budgeting and packing to traveling the continent. General tips blend with country profiles throughout, maps to help plan, and insights on European history and culture, making this a top recommendation any general library with a strong travel section will want.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
5,Life Saver,"Thanks I recieved my book in good timing, and would buy more from this seller.Keep up the good work I was a little afraid at first to make the buy, but now I'm glady that I did. Thanks Lawon Smith"
3,Our old one broke,We had to get a replacement for our old one. The old one snapped when beating bread dough. We hope this one works better and doesn't give out like the last one.
3,Dough hook too small,"My 5 quart bowl is too big for my hook that I just bought. I kneed (lol) it to make pizza dough and 4 cups of flour barely touches the bottom of the hook. I might have to get a smaller bowl or a longer hook? I'd love some advice on ease of return/exchange and smallerbowl/longerhook issues. Thanks bakers, Patrick 47ronin62@gmail.com"
2,The Dough Hook Is to Short,I have a K4SS mixer and when using this new hook It does not reach far enough into the bowl to mix the bread dough. not sure if I have to make a double batch so It will reach but It sure isnt long enough to Knead the dough. I'm going to return this one.
4,"""Re-designed""","The instructions that came with this dough hook say that it has been re-designed and to reduce the amount of kneading time for your recipes. The hook is slightly twisted, and it didn't seem like much of a re-design, but it must be since it does a better job than the old style hook that came with the machine. Haven't had it long enough [only a week] to notice any chipping of the coating yet, hence only 4 stars.February 20, 2013Eleven months later and it is still doing a good job. We only rinse it off with warm water and let it dry. If there are large dough pieces stuck to it, we let it soak until they are soft, and remove them by hand before rinsing and drying."
3,"some hits, some misses","Always been a fan of Norm's wit, and this standup routine definitely has some funny moments - but it also has some misses. Additionally, he's constantly touching his face for some unknown reason, and it almost seems like he's behaving as if on some kind of medication - not sure if that was supposed to be part of the act, but it was more distracting than funny IMO."
3,Tell stories....thats the entire book,"Seth gives some good examples of story telling in his book but this should be an essay, not a book."
3,much ado about little,"It contains a handful of brilliant thoughts about the importance of original and coherent marketing ideas built around a new product or service. However, greater research/case study support seems to be sometimes missing. Worth reading though and it won't take you more than a few days."
3,Needs to lose his own preconceived bias.,The book is pretty good over all. The only problem is you are constantly told of examples from the authors liberal bias. To bad he couldnt leave the politics out of it.
4,Where are her early recordings?,I'm a suburban Chicagoite who used to go to Bonnie's gigs. I bought her records and have wondered where I can buy CD versions of her albums. Where are these CD's? Who can get them made? I know there is a market out there for her wonderful voice and music.
1,Bad Product...,I should return this item considering it is faulty...wiring to thin and does not keep a steady signal i was using for outdoor wifi antennae....shame to say i paid the same price for a better wire and its 4x as thick...i need to find a replacement part for the other one as this one does me no good....big waste of money and time...im very disappointed in amazon selling products that arent any good....i just dont have the time to ship this back...dont buy this product
3,Antenna Cable,"The cable arrived in a timely fashion but the N side connector was poorly secured and came off with little effort. I made the repair and it mated to the R/T and antenna beautifully. Unless the cable I got was an oddity, or you have cable repair experience, try a different brand."
3,Ok atv,Atv is missing the handle bars...unless attached in box somewhere. It's a gift so haven't actually opened box. A little larger than expected. Wasn't much information given on dimensions. My son will love it though!
2,Looks Cheap,"This product looks very cheap and it is not worth the money they demand. The green tear drop looks bad as well and when it rotates, it wobbles instead of maintaining the center position. Not worth the time and money spent on this."
3,ok,Arrived on time and in ok condition for the product material. It is not as sturdy as it looks and would recommend buying something else.
3,Just alright.,Not nearly as nice as we were expecting for the price-when compared with other online bags. The material is decent but definitely feels like plastic. The most annoying part is that you can only put stuff in through the side.
2,Should have sent back,"The bag it self is of good quality. The zipper and location are horrible,you have to feel around and guess where the opening us on the top for the hanger to come out, if the zipper went up to the top it would be much easier to use. All I can say is it is very difficult to use."
4,Garment Bags,"They do exactly what I bought them for. They arrived on time, are the color I ordered and appear to be sturdy enough to last a while."
3,Awkward zipper location,I just don't like where the zipper is located on the site panel - it's awkward to open and add/remove items.
5,Just the right length for dresses,"I needed this item to transport dresses, two full calf length dresses and I love it."
1,A Terrible Travel Garment Bag,"This travel garment bag would be ok if it remained in your closet at home, but to travel on an airplane, or to go on a cruise ship; it was such a terrible disappointment!! There is no handle to carry this garment bag. There is no place on the garment bag to hang tags from airlines or a cruise ships which would identify where the garment bag is to be taken; what room or what deck, etc. THIS IS A JOKE FOR A TRAVEL BAG. WE ARE PUTTING IT INTO THE TRASH WHERE IT BELONGS......... WE WERE SO DISAPPOINTED WITH YOUR PRODUCT. At this point, I doubt that we would trust buying another product from you. I hate to say this to you, but we feel that we muist be honest.Sincerely,Martha Stanton"
3,Not much better than the intrinsic mic,"I bought this for my Canon HG10 because the onboard mic picked up the videographers voice loud and clear, but the subjects audio was very hard to hear. This mic didn't make much difference. When I am taping the kids and ask them a question, my voice is very loud. Their answers are barely audible. So much for being directional. It is nice that the power is on board, as well. The non-canon mics have to be turned on and off usually, and if you forget to turn them off, dead battery... OOPS!"
1,Comparison MS Presenter 3000 - Logitech Cordless Presenter,"I am a lecturer who likes to move around freely, i.e. up to a good five meters away from my laptop. I first bought an MS Presenter 3000, without consulting any rewiews, I stumbled over it in the store and on the package a suitable range was promised. I found myself restricted to about 1.5 meters around the laptop for reliable use. I nevertheless used it for some time but got annoyed more and more. I found out that I am not the only person having troubles with this device. So I did not even gave the MS Presenter a second try through replacement, but - before bringing it back for cash refund, to be able to make a 1:1 comparison - I bought a Logitech Cordless 2.4 GHz Presenter for about double the price. It was worth it. With the same batteries, the Logitech Presenter has a reliable range of at least 10 meters."
5,EXCELLENT,This book was EXCELLENT!! It was a suggested read for me a couple of years ago but I never got a chance to read it until now. I finished the entire book in 3 days. Truly a page turner. Can't wait until the other books in this series come out on Kindle also.
3,Easy to use but....,"This product was very easy to use in a 2-D model, but it does not have the abilitie to create and powerfull 3-D models. It has a lot of great tools(for 2-D) that make it interesting. This is a great product if you want to make things only in 2-D, but if you are thinking about 3-D, I would not recomend it."
5,One stop shopping for John Hartford fans,Nice collection of some of John's more well known tunes. I'm a huge fan and have seen him live many times. His passing was a great loss to music fans as he was a great entertainer and a champion for American music. I also recommend the Live from the Mountain Stage recording. Some of the same tunes are on it but it's still worth a listen. I believe that John knew he was dying of cancer when he recorded that and it makes some of the lyrics bittersweet.
2,Beater isn't dishwasher safe,This beater was the only one to choose for my mixer.I am extremely disappointed that the company doesn't offer aDISHWASHER SAFE beater like this.
2,"Works fine for a year or so until it's ruined. Now looking for 3RD replacement for this ""disposable"" item.",Who would've thought that these things wear out and must be discarded so often!?I've previously purchased two of these as replacement beaters for our Mixer. They have each worked well for a year or so but then the plastic coating starts to wear away and falls off into your cookies/rolls/bread/whatever.I honestly thought that the first time was a fluke but now that the second beater has shown the same problem I'd call it a flaw. I'm wondering if there is some other option for beaters that will NOT fall apart into my food after a year of mild to moderate use. I don't want to spend $15 every year on a stupid beater!
5,mixer bit,fantastic for mixing and for liking the remains off of bit. Would sell a small farm in south africa for a chance to use this mixer bit again.
4,wish it were dishwasher safe,"The white coating will peel off with repeated washings in the dishwasher, but I wish it were dishwasher safe."
2,Beater Replacement,The only reason for two star is because it's not the beater for my mixer. It needs to be longer and I am going to be returning this one and try to get the right one for my mixer. Received promptly and would have been wonderful if it was the right length.
3,Beware the powder-coat.,"I'm not giving this 2 stars because the paddle I purchased from amazon hasn't fallen apart on me yet. That being said, it was a replacement for the paddle that came with my kitchen aid that I've only had for a couple of years. I do bake, but not excessively and certainly not in a commercial capacity and the powder-coating started flaking off maybe a year into owning the machine. I ordered this replacement when it started coming off into the food. You'd think these things would last longer."
5,What would Jesus eat?,This is a wonderful book that goes strictly out of the Bible on how we are supposed to eat! I would highly recommend this book to anyone!!!
3,Catch and Capture,The material is dated and comes across a little corny. There is too much time spent capturing animals instead of filming them in their natural environment. So most of the material is about the antics of Mr. Perkins and his sidekicks as they capture everything from anteaters to eagles.
2,Lady Vampires Flick,"Ho hum flick by Full Moon studios about a group of lady vampires. I wouldn't recommend it, but see it if you must. i got it in a pack of 8 DVDs for 5 bucks at the store. Half of them were from Full Moon."
1,I saw nothing,"This has got to be one of the most forgettable movies ever. I rented it a few months ago and watched it several times (in my location there's no cable or broadcast tv). Last week I rented it again by mistake and again watched it several times. I cannot remember a thing about it. Well, maybe a little- it's more interesting than staring at a blank wall, but just barely.So I guess it's not a keeper."
2,I would go generic,"Up to you, but I would buy a generic branded battery of the same type (Lithium BP522). I bought a generic battery and it works just as well -- saved me $50 !"
3,Eh,"This movie wasn't awful, but it could have been better. The storyline (especially at the beginning) is not as tight as it could be, and the story between the main character and his wife just felt rather contrived and unneeded. However, once he becomes 'Big Momma', the story definitely picks up. He does a nice job as Big Momma, with some truly memorable and entertaining scenes, such as when he shows up at his boss' office, and the security man tries to stop her, and uses a metal detector which finds the underwire of her bra. Not skipping a beat, she offers to take it off but warns him about her large chest. Nothing actually gets taken off, but this scene is pretty funny, and the one where 'Hattie' meets the other prospective nannies when she is trying to snag the nanny job. It's a decent sequel."
4,We love Big Momma 2,Despite what the critcs say. The is a great film and flat-out. The story out with Malcolm investigating who kill his mentor. So he becomes Big Mama once again to follow up on a lead. By posing as a nanny. Give the movie a chance and judge for yourself.
4,Big Momma is Back,Big Momma's House was a ggod movie. It wasn't as good as the first movie (but it hardly ever is!) The second movie was cleaner than the first movie. It only had a few cuss words and no nudity(refering to the spa scene.) It was an over all good movie and I think you should go see Big Momma's House 2.
3,Just one of those different sequels...,"Big Momma's House 2 delivers luaghs and a sense of suspense throughout the film, but, overall, wasn't that great. Big Momma returns as a nanny for three children of a man who may be part of a murder of a cop. I'm not sure what else to say, just that the movie falls apart and ends up being a tad corny and lifeless...I mean, would that ever happen? I think it's better to watch movies that have happened or could ever happen, unless it's like a remake of something in the past...like a fantasy film. This film is just a laugh-out-loud, but only on some parts. It ends up being just...average."
4,Works for me...,"Though not detailed enough for some specific areas such as electronics, the diagrams work well enough for part timers like me to fumble through. Given that I have a 1999, this book is getting a bit more useful as time goes by!"
4,Decent Book.,"The book has nearly all the information I need to make repairs to my jeep. While, in some cases, the instructions are not crystal clear, it's very nice to have the manual for clarifications. It includes all the engine codes and common issues as well as solutions."
2,nothing special,"I didn't have many razor bumps to begin with, but this solution only eliminated 30% of the bumps. Been using it for the past month and a half."
5,Works great!,"I've been using Bump Patrol for about 2 years now. I used to struggle with shaving bumps all over my neck, but as soon as I started using this product, the bumps stopped. I use this in place of a regular aftershave."
2,Hoping her other books are better,"If you want to read something by a female punk rocker who can actually write, I suggest Lisa Crystal Carver or Jennifer Blowdryer. This book got me thinking so I gave it two stars, although it did set my BS detector off. Lunch insists that she is a predator of the male species but as it turns out, she has let her whole life be defined by men, then tries to blame men for all of her own, and by extension, society's problems. One book and one interview were enough for me; her speaking style is like her writing style: grating, monotonous, superficial...kind of like bad sex."
1,Don't bother... I left my copy in an alley.,"I've read the book, and been confused on multiple fronts, like, how exactly are these authors marginalized? The book reads like it was written by a duo of confused soccer moms who whine about their ""conceptual baggage"" to no end. People that the authors feel are marginalized: women, Olympic Athletes, and well, that's about all I could find.If you're embarrassed by middle-class women who portray themselves as being on the margins of society because of their gender, this book isn't for you. Any information presented is basic, common sense info compounded by words the authors seem to think are cute, like ""bibbets"" (bits of information or data collected during research).Yeah, whatever ladies."
4,Found this on his webpage at wcsu,He received his doctorate in Aesthetics and Psychology from The Union Institute in 1981. He has a masters in literature from NYU and a B.A. from Wesleyan University
1,"trying to sell it on ebay, waste of money","I hate this bra. Over rated, terrible fit. The straps slip off and the cup size is definately not the size I am used to. I thought it would be perfect, but I only wanted it for the low back. I am now trying to re sell it on ebay. I am resorting to buying a bra that fits properly and is comfortable and buying a seperate strap adjuster for the back to make it a low back bra. I do not recommend this product at all, however it was a fantastic price on Amazon, compared to other sites for this particular brand."
1,Never buy from IN THE MOOD INTIMATES,"This seller, ""In the Mood Intimates,"" is highly disreputable. I bought a matched bra and panty set, same color, as a gift. The bra was at a great sale price, the matching panty was at full price. The total, in excess of $100, qualified me for a $10 discount and free shipping.Twelve (12) days after receiving my credit card remittance, they shipped me the panty only, with no explanation as to the missing bra. Over the next three days, I left eleven (11) detailed voice mail messages with In the Mood Intimates, receiving no response. Finally, another nine (9) days later, I received an e-Mail asserting that they no longer had the bra in stock, and indicating their refusal to accept a return of the panty (even though its packaging is unopened) owing to the nature of the item.Meanwhile, they have charged me for shipping and taken away the $10 discount.These people are dishonest. Stay away from them."
5,Hot Little Number,"I bought this for my girlfriend and she looked sexy as hell in it. 100% guaranteed to make your man happy, ladies."
3,Does not fit Chinese SKS,"Bought this to replace the gas tube on my Chinese SKS as I was upgrading the stock as well to preserve the original wood stock. I tried sliding the piston in and it does not fit. I don't see any rust in there like a previous reviewer said, so there isn't much I can do about it."
1,"This Mounts Not worth the savings, Get something better.","I bought this gas tube to replace the older worn out gas tube, and hate to say it but the new one doesnt work nearly as good as the original thats all beat up and used! yah it looks nice on the gun and all, but when there is so much slop in it for it shake forom side to side, and the gas tube wont even blow the action back after each shot. I would not reccomend this gas tube to anybody, It will save you money but will actually do more harm than good in the long run unfortunatly."
5,Liquid eye cream,"I like the fact that this eye ""cream"" is not thick. It's easier to apply than other thick eye creams. You don't have to rub your eyes to apply the product. Easy to apply!"
3,too soon to tell,"I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now. I definitely like the feel of the cream and use it twice a day. It's lightly moisturizing and works well under make-up. I think I am beginning to see the effects under my eyes. They are appearing to lighten up. I say lighten up as in skin thickening not lightening discoloration ~ my darkness is from thinning under the lids due to aging not hyper-pigmentation. Also, I wanted to use it as a prep for the retin-a micro I just received in order to prevent the dryness wrinkles. However, I do not use it on the upper lids because it is my understanding that no retinol type product should be used there. I am a licensed aesthetician and just wanted to get that FYI out there because I did read that some of the reviewers were doing that. You might want to ask your doc."
3,Causes puffy eyes in the morning.,"I think it works fine smoothing small shallow wrinkles but it makes my eyes extra puffy in the morning. Puffiness goes away in an hour of so but it's not supposed to happen in a first place.Some other review here mentioned this cream smelled bad.I have to disagree, mine is unscented."
2,"2 months, no change","I've been using this around my eyes twice daily for two months now - I've seen no change, no improvement. The cap is annoying and product leaks out."
3,Not bad,"I have not seen any difference to be honest but one thing I can say is that it is non irritating, most eye creams I have tried sting, burn and make my eyes watery so in that sense it is great. I hope I see some results though that would be great."
4,The cheapest solution to eye wrinkles and dark coloration.,"I'm a man, and have had dark bags under my eyes from staying up too late playing video games and watching TV since I was 16. Having used this product off an on for about a month I can say that I have noticed a difference in the color of the skin under my eyes. I think there would have been a greater difference if I had corrected my sleeping habits and applied the lotion twice a day instead of just when I go to sleep. This product however is by far the cheapest solution to dark eye circles and unlike most other product it can be easily obtained at a local drug store. Since I am young, I can't really comment as to its effectiveness on clearing wrinkeles but for those of you night owls out there who either dont get much sleep or spend a majority of your time looking at a tv screen, I would reccomend it."
4,Gentle Eye Moisturizer,"I have used other eye creams such as Clinique All About Eye and Shiseido Eye Revitalizer. Roc Eye Cream is better because of its price & it's really gentle and moisturizes the eye area well. Unlike other RoC products, this one doesn't sting at all, so I use it all around my eyes even on eyelids. It's that gentle. Also, it spreads easily, and is not oily or sticky. Although I don't really see the obvious effects, I will be using it as a good eye moisturizer and as a preventative."
4,The secret of this product....,"is to use it constantly multiple times a day. I tried twice a day (morning and night) and it had hardly any effect at all, but then one day I was in the house all day and just applied it constantly and over the course of about 2-3 days after doing that I saw noticable improvement. The jury is still out, but it seems that applying this only once or twice a day just wont cut it."
2,no changes after 1 month,This did nothing for my dark circles after using it twice daily for a whole month. I will wait another one month before I toss it. Will keep you updated if there are changes...
2,Didn't do much at all,"I'm a 35 year old male. My skin usually responds well to ""beauty"" products, and I typically will see improvement easily. I had high hopes for this product. I used this eye cream for 6 weeks, the only improvement that I saw was that the darkness under my eyes was slightly lightened on days where I felt very tired. This product did absolutely nothing to improve my eye wrinkles situation.If you want to actually get rid of eye wrinkles within a week and smooth out and actually tighten your skin, try using one or both of these:Neutrogena Ageless Intensives Deep Wrinkle Moisture, Night, 1.4 OunceNeutrogena Men Age Fighter Face Moisturizer, 1.4 Ounce"
1,Does not keep its promises!,"I only sleep 4-5 hours every night and have pretty bad dark circles. I have used two tubes of this eye cream in the hope that maybe it just takes longer to work but didn't see any improvement. Actually, it has made my dark circles even worse and as for the few wrinkles under my eyes, they are still there. Waste of money!"
5,very cute!,I bought this for my grandson for halloween. He looked adorable and the hat was great. Really made the outfit smart looking!
5,Creative financing strategies that still work!,"They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery in which case Robert Allen should be sincerely flattered! Before Nothing Down, who else offered this advice? Answer: NO ONE!Yeah, we had William Nickerson's classic (a fine book for the buy and hold who have a ton of money to invest and the ability to fix up a property) but nobody butu Robert Allen provides the wildy creative techniques to buy real estate NOTHING DOWN.Notice that I did not say that Robert Allen invented these techniques, he was the first to share them. Prior to Robert Allen, only savvy investors who picked the brains of other savvy real estate investors knew about these techniques...and they weren't sharing! God forbid if everybody found out how to do this, that would tap into their profits.Thank God that Robert Allen sees things differently. Thank you Robert for sharing."
3,3 stars for the effect by tom savini,"i got this movie becasue of the high praise it got on amazon.some of it was well deserved,like the praise for tom savini's sfx.but the story of the movie was kind of boring at times when hes not killing anyone.i eman its an ok movie that any horror fan should watch at least once,rent maybe unless you LOVE gore and blood then i say you should buy it.there are plenty of special features on the disc which is good and its directed by wiwlliam lustig(maniac cop,uncle sam)so if your a fan of his run and get this movie.aside from the few laggin story parts the movie was good and the end was a shocker that you have to see to belive.your either gonna love,hate or fall somewhere in between with this movie.not for anyone who dosent enjoy horror,blood or guts."
4,"He's a maniac, maniac, that's for sure.","William Lustig isn't a very good filmmaker, but Maniac shines as his best flick by far. Then again, this isn't difficult when your other movies include Uncle Sam (""He wants you...DEAD!""). Good image quality, reasonably priced. Classic horror."
3,Not nearly as bad as most critics would say,"Joe Spinell's performance is what makes this movie. His acting is excellent and brings great emotion to the sick character of Frank Zito. So much emotion that one cannot help but sometimes empathize with his raging pain. This movie is well directed and is worth seeing for (though predictable), the subway scene alone. Do not believe what you've read about the gore effects. They are not impressive at all. The razor blade deaths look incredibly fake. But Maniac is not the mysoginist slasher flick in which it advertises itself. It is a well made character study about a disturbed, suffering man."
1,Complete waste of two hours,"I had high hopes for this film after a cult film employee reccomended it while browsing through my favourite obscure titles. I was let down as Maniac is nothing more than a cheap exploitation serial killer bio-pic.This is not your typical slasher as it is told from the first person, in this case it is mamma's boy played by Joe spinnel. He's whiney and obsessivley crazy, probably the most annoying antangoinst ever.Granted there is the infamous 'point blank shotgun' scene but other than that, there is no entertainment value to this film unless you're a misgonistic lunatic. I was hoping the only saving grace to this film would be gratutious nudity but there is none thus not even making a true exploitation film.Avoid this title like the plague."
4,classic slasher,"Spinell is excellent. Get it. See it. Absolutely believable portrayal of a serial killer.The only problem I have with this flick is Caroline Munro. She had no business being in this movie, none whatsoever.Couple of her scenes damn near almost bring the movie to a complete standstill--but Joe Spinell's right-on-target performance is so great that soon enough the movie picks up where it left off (before Munro appeared on the scene) and delivers the powerhouse scares."
2,Unimpressed,"There are better books than this on Enochian. When I bought this volume I had very few books on the subject and it probably ended up confusing me more. While presented in an antiquarian fashion it lacks references to where the author had taken the information from. For those who are serious on Enochian, I would recommend Cassabon (if you can track it down), Turner's Elizabethan Magic, and the books published in McLean's Magnum Opus Heremetic Sourcework series."
4,Great Album,This is a great album if you are a Journey or Storm fan. They sound very similar. Some of the songs on this album sound alike but its still good. This is on par or better than their first album. Obviously they are not around anymore..thus the asking price for this album. FYI.. you can get this album on iTunes for less than ten bucks! Download it if you can.
4,An interesting surprise,"I heard Josh's song on the radio and decided to check him out. After reading an online review saying he has been compared to Dave Matthews, Jack Johnson, John Mayer and Jason Mraz, I decided to go out and purchase his CD. What I got was something great! While Kelley does remind me of the artists I mentioned, he still has his own unique style, which makes him exceptionable. His calm voice and intriguing lyrics make him more than just another 1 hit wonder. I think he will be around for a while, and continue to make good quality music."
3,chill album,"This album, for the ride home, is a great protrayal of what such artists as John Mayer and Jack Johnson are trying to push in the music world. For the ride home is an acoustic set with an american sound. Although this album has very little backround instruments to it other than the basic guitar, drums and bass, the melodic sequences fill in very well. Overall, Josh Kelley comes through with a smooth chill sound ready for helping some deal with emotions."
4,oh,"This album is different than his debut. No rock guitars, and his lyrics are much darker/ sadder than the first one. Listening to Raphael is a treat because he writes very poetic. Very good."
2,You need to know plants to benefit from this book,"Dutchmen Gerritsen and Oudolf label Boltonia a ""troublesome, demanding plant."" The same with our common wildflower Monkshood. They say that Knipofia won't survive winter. Lobelia hybrids are ""only for people with green fingers."" ""Tierella wherryi is quite reliable when you look after it properly..."" All of these plants are favorites in US gardens.And the crowning insult to American readers -- Echniacea (Purple Coneflower) is labeled ""troublesome."" This is one of the most popular perennials in the US!While I appreciate the design ideas of Oudolf's earlier books, this one is a bust as far as plant advice for US readers goes -- and the plant descriptions take up most of the book."
2,Shipping problem but not sure whos fault,Took a little longer than expected to receive and when it showed up it was upside down. There were no clear markings on the box to let the shipper know it should not be turned over or which side was up. Unit never worked from day one. Not expecting a problem and looking for the easiest way to get the unit out I cut the box and threw it out. Now I have no way to pack it up and ship it back plus I don't want to pay the shipping which is a third of the cost of the unit. Lesson learned? Do not buy products like this on line.
2,Haier Beverage Center,"I bought this beverage cooler at Sam's. At first I was pleased with it, until I realized that some cans were warm, some cool, some cold and some frozen. It never defrosts. The kicker for me was when I determined it was increasing my electric bill around $70 monthly! Just not worth it to me. Can't return it now, so I only use it when I'm entertaining large crowds. Looks nice though."
2,Disappointing,"This book is simply a journal article padded to book length.Moreover, there is really nothing new or interesting that cannot be learned from a rigorous reading of Artaud's published work. Barber should have published this in ArtForum and we readers could have saved our money. A profound disappointment."
1,Battlefield Suck,"wow, this was a great movie, NOT!!!, horrible performances. Travolta's performance is smashed by other stupid supporting characters. I got bored 20 minutes into the movie and it never got better. way obnoxious, by anymeans"
1,What Were They Thinking,"I don't know why the people of hollywood had to destroy the great book written by L. Ron Hubbard. While I was watching the movie, it saddened me to see that they covered the first 100 pages in the first 10 minutes of the movie. The movie takes place in the future where an alien race takes over the earth to mine certain minerals from the ground. Travolta plays a disgruntled alien security advisor that is looking for a way off the wretched planet Earth. Barry Pepper plays one of the few remaining humans on the planet. The movie is slow, jumps about from one thing to another. It really didn't do anything for me. The acting was really poor as well, and I wonder why Travolta even agreed do such a thing. The book was such a wonderful story. It had a great message about humanity and hope. This movies destroys all of that and replaces it with abnoxious jokes and a few loud explosions. I would avoid this film if it were at all possible."
4,"New, Different, and Innovative","All the critics and the judges for the ""emmys"" and ""oscers"" always say the same thing, "" Why can't anyone make a different kind of movie"".Well Battlefield Earth is a different kind of movie, but the crybaby critcs still wine, because they asked for a different kind of movie but they're still judging it by same narrow minded view of what makes a good movie, as if a movie that doesn't have a so called ""deeper meaning"" is inferior.This makes me sick.Judge movies for what they try to do."
1,Don't Battle for Battlefield Earth,"Okay, there are some words that you just cant print on a family site like Amazon, but you can guess what they are! And Battlefield Earth should be among them!Don't waste your time. Give another sci-fi film of the summer the attention it really deserves and catch TITAN AE, the real secret of the past year!Absolutely 0 stars for B.E. - the 1 star is towards Titan AE (which would give it 6 stars)!"
1,"I've never heard the word ""leverage"" so many times....","I knew this movie stunk... but I mean... it really DOES stink!The word ""leverage"" is repeated over and over, it's like the director wanted to hypnotize his crowd with subliminal messages. The past reviewer said it all... ""It's like riding horses"", read that one too.This movie is riduculous, I'm a SFX designer and I felt insulted with the mokery made towards Sci-Fi films along this one.My advice avoid this one... no... scartch that... rent it and watch HOW messed up can a movie actually be.Buah haa haa haaa haa!"
2,This will be infamous for the years to come.,"John Travolta is the big-bad space alien out to make the diminishing human race dig gold for him. Barry Pepper stars as the hero who rises up against him. Really, really stupid sci-fi ""epic"" has a truckload of plot holes, hilarious dialogue (Probably partially intentional), clumsily executed action sequences, and lame make-up effects. Still, this remain's rather watchable for its high-energy level and mostly good special effects. It's a mess of Dune-like proportions, but you might have some fun watching it."
1,Not Exactly the High Point of John Travolta's Career,"I'm not going to pick apart this movie into 218 different plot holes. I don't watch movies to catch plot holes, I watch movies to pass time when I can't sleep at night. Here's the problem: I spent the entire movie wondering how these blathering idiots of aliens ever managed to take over earth, let alone maintain control over it, when they show, time and time again, how imbecilic they are. I was astounded by the bad acting, the forced lines, and the way that the actors themselves seemed none too thrilled to be in the movie. The high point, for me, was Forest Whittaker's character. I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt, however, and say that the actors truly did their best with the material they were given, and is, perhaps, the only reason that this movie should be awarded a single star rating at all."
1,Trashing a successful novel,"What's the worst thing one can say about a movie based on a successful novel? : They gave it the typical Hollywood treatment.As a long-time sci-fi fan (age 69), I like my movies to add a reasonably faithful visual dimension to the story. It didn't happen here.Yes, special effects were spectacular; action was fast and frantic, if mostly irrelevant. The original theme and scope of the novel were, in large part, completely ignored. Translating the novel's alien characters to parodies of human actors may have been a practical and artistic necessity (after all, earth's atmosphere was instant poison to the aliens, requiring full breathing masks - not the hospital-like enrichment tubes of the movie - and they were much taller and more massive than humans).For one who has enjoyed rereading the novel several times, the movie was an acute disappointment. Again, typically Hollywood."
1,A Movie that would make Ed Wood proud,"Where to start??...Was it just the concept of taking L. Ron Hubbard's bombastic overwritten ""War & Peace"" length novel and bringing it to the big screen, the horrible make-up and costumes, the insultingly childish dialog, or what truly may be John Travolta's most pathetic performance ever, or a combination of all the above to make what without a doubt may be the worst ""sci-fi"" movie since ""Plan 9 From Outer Space."" At least ""Plan 9"" was made with the best of intentions. ""Battlefield Earth"" is dreadful...tiresome to watch, a plot that goes nowhere, script-writing straight out of 2nd Grade classroom and a Vinny Barbarino-esque main character, Terl, that is just painful to watch. This trash needs to be locked away with a sign that reads ""Open Only In Case of Glitter Pt. 2"""
1,Why... I ask you... why?,"Yes- I did watch it... all two hours of it and it was quite honestly two of the longest hours of my life. It is hands down the worst movie I have ever seen. The jokes aren't funny. The dialogue is annoying. The effects are of special ed quality. I beleive the ""actors"" could only work at night, because they were unable to get away from their day jobs at Denny's. Terrible.... terrible to the point that you can enjoy seeing it in its misery. Think about it.. we are a society that slows down for car accidents... but if this was an accident (and it is) by the side of the road - you would speed up to avoid seeing it! It is that bad!"
1,A real disappointment,"I'll keep this short and simple...I got this movie because I'm a science fiction nut, but this movie just bored me to death. I thought having John as the main character in this movie would mean it would be at least OK...boy was I wrong. Terrible plot and the squence of events just didn't add up. Not recommended."
3,It had good moments and bad moments,"'Battlefield Earth' had some good moments and bad moments. I like the fact John Travolta played an evil role. He needs to play more roles like this one. Some moments were silly and stupid, but I liked being transported to another time and place. This movie did it successfully."
5,Definitely buy and see this one!,My personal opinion is quite different than the critics. The critics went way overboard-as usual. Does anybody really listen to the critics-I hope not. This DVD really has some good stuff on it. The commentary is special because you are getting inside data on how the movie was made and various details from the director and art director. It wsa very cool to see behind the secenes shotsand interviews from the people involved with the movie. I also liked the movie itself--it is true Sci-Fi. The special effects were well done and amazing when you consider the budget of $20 million to make the movie itself-including the special effects shots. The DVD was number 2 on the charts-so obviously others agree. Check it out.
1,"""Probably the worst movie ever made""","Battlefield Earth, starring John Travolta, Barry Pepper and Forest Whitaker, is perhaps the worst movie ever made. It is completely boring, way too long, not action-packed and did I mention extremely boring! Barry Pepper was horribly cast and Travolta and Whitaker...how could you force yourself to do this? This movie is not even worth renting. It is horrible, dreadful, and dumb."
4,Battlefield Earth vs Episode I,"I viewed this movie thinking it would be so bad it might be amusing. I was surprised when it was not bad at all. It is a good old fashioned good guy vs. bad guy film. Compared to the most over-hyped piece of garbage ever, Star Wars-Episode I, Battlefield Earth is a great movie. It did not have any charicters as annoying as Jar Jar Binks. I enjoyed both Travolta and Forest Whitaker as the bad guys. I think this movie got a bad rap because of it's connection to Travolta's religion. It's a shame we are not above such a thing."
2,Very average. No worse than many other B movies.,"Not quite as bad as some would have you believe. The large hole in this film is the villain. The makeup is VERY poor and as a result Travolta has no real menace. He just isn't frightening or scary. The main human lead is equally weak, with a terrible hair-cut. The FX are no better or worse than a lot of other mid-range FX movies and the direction is actually quite good in places. It's ok for a cheap purchase / rental and the disc has some features. Good picture and sound. It's simply an average B movie made with a little more care."
3,Only watch for the FX,"First of all you must suspend belief of all reality,I mean really super suspend.It's got some decent effects and action scenes,but at the end of the movie I got a huge headache.Too bad it did so poorly that they cancelled the sequel.Maybe in another 20 yrs they'll do a reboot of this film?"
2,Bad movie. Excellent DVD,"When I saw this in theatre, I have absolutely no idea what's going on in the movie. Seems like the movie jump from one scene to another like bad editing. So when I got a used DVD that is real cheap, I decided to give it another try. Well, I still don't like the movie but the DVD itself is great. The Dolby 5.1 is excellent and so is the picture transfer. Director Roger Christian provided a commentary track. I would suggest you listen to it even if you hate the movie. It is really insightful. The plot about earth that is enslaved by Alien race. The Alien general is played by John Travolta with heavy make up. Barry Pepper (the sniper from Saving Private Ryan) is the hero. Like I said earlier the story is confusing but I really think that is because of poor editing. But this DVD is really good to show off your sound system."
4,GOOD EFFECTS !!!,"THIS MOVIE SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN AT LEAST 3 1/2 STARS.THE EFFECTS ARE REALLY GOOD.IF YOU LIKE SCI-FI MOVIES THEN THIS MOVIE IS FOR YOU.FOR TRAVOLTA FANS THIS MOVIE IS FOR YOU AS WELL,JOHN TRAVOLTA LOOKS REALLY COOL.I THOUGHT HE'D NEVER BE IN A MOVIE WITH THAT KIND OF CHARACTER.THIS IS A REALLY GOOD FLICK MAYBE IT COULD OF BEEN BETTER BUT THIS MOVIE GOT 4 STARS OUT OF ME.BUY THIS MOVIE IT'S A CLASSIC SCI-FI.HOW MUCH GOLD DOES ""FORT KNOX"" REALLY HAVE !!!"
1,"""So Pissed Off""","Angie, Angie, Angie...What happened? Your first two albums were fantastic and innovative. I had such high expectations for this one as well. But instead you put out this DRECK that is not worthy of your talents! Every song sounds just like the lousy one before it-WITH THE EXACT SAME BEAT!!! Angie c'mon, SNOOP??!! SNOOP??!! Of all the TONS of amazing rappers at your disposal, you hire dat ""NIZZLE""? Puh-leeze! You could have done everyone a huge favor by obtaining the rights to your early DEVOX sessions and re-releasing them on cd. That would have been hot!You get one star because every artist is allowed one stinker, but please gits yo ""it"" togetha for the next one."
4,Stone Love,"I'm ashamed to say that I'm late to the Angie Stone party. What a talent! This woman is a once in a generation find. And this album/cd is further confirmation of that. My favorite song so far is ""You're Gonna Get It"" with her daughter, Diamond. I didn't like her colloboration with Snoop Dog, and I'm glad the same song is included without his rapp. A truly great talent!"
4,VERY PLEASED,This is my first purchase of Angie Stone's music. The entire CD is pretty good even though a few songs contain rap. It's a good driving CD.
3,She sounds pretty decent....,"I wouldn't compare her to Gladys Knight, however. On the other hand, if the previous reviewer has so many problems with black female singers, he should go back to Poland."
5,Can't Stop Listening!!!!!!,This CD is great!!!! I can not stop listening to it. If you are looking for a great neosoul CD this is the one. A great buy!!!
1,STOP COPY PROTECTION,"the US release of Angie Stone's ""Stone Love"" is ruined by Copy protection. Soem cds say ""Content protected"". When a cd is labeled as ""Content protection"", usually it includes SunnComm MediaMax Version 5 content protection software that may expose security vulnerability when played on PCs and usually you can make small amounts of copies to cd-r's and I-pods or other digital music players. but this is ""copy protected"". I can't even transfer it onto cassette. And from my understanding, every international release of this album except Japan, also is copy protected. I know that the music industry is trying to cut down on Piracy but I feel that once you purchase a cd, it's yours and you should be able to do whatever you want with it. I don't think it was fair that I had to buy this twice : once on cd form and the other on I Tunes. I am against music piracy but I'm also against copy protecting cds. I hate that I can't transfer this cd onto my i pod"
3,Music Great . . . Actual CD Disappointing,"I'm a casual Angie Stone fan, and I was blown away by this disc. It's an amazing third effort from Stone. ""Stone Love"" covers several genres of R&B/Soul music, from the currently popular ""neo-soul"" to Betty Wright-influenced cuts and soul with a pop edge. My biggest complaint--big enough for a two-star loss--is the copy-protection on the CD. I could only rip the disc to my PC in WMA format, which means I couldn't transfer it to my iPod. I can understand artists and especially greedy record companies not wanting consumers to ""bootleg"" albums, but I've been prevented from using this music in a legal manner. My only legal option is to purchase the album again on iTunes, but I am instead forced to download the album from a p2p. Thanks a lot, J records!"
2,not effective for me,First they don't really stick to the affected area at all. Next they are so thin (see through thin) that they easily fold in 2 and are rendered ineffective.I read some folks seem to like them and perhaps its a personal thing and perhaps its because I tried canker covers first. These are fairly cheap so worth a try - see for yourself. For me there is no comparison - canker covers actually stick to the affected area. I will say though that canker covers could be a little thinner - they are almost too thick.I did use repeatedly to try to adjust to them (and use up the box I bought). I will not repurchase.
5,Perfect book about my favorite Blankie!,"I am 29 years old and I still sleep with my blankie. This book is great -- it captures all the emotions I remember from growing up with a blankie that never left my side. If your baby has a blanky or if you used to (or you still do), read this book. It's priceless!"
2,"wanted to love it, but has too much negativity","My son LOVES his blankie, so it seemed natural to purchase this book for him. I do love most of the book, however there are a few things I can't get over. ""I'm afraid of the dark"" - now why would I want to suggest my son should be afraid of the dark? ""I don't like bedtime"" (with a picture of a baby crying as the mom carries baby up the stairs) again, not an idea I want to repeatedly read to my son. I wanted to love it, and could change the words, but the picture of the baby crying while going upstairs to bed isn't something I can change. Super disappointed. This seems to be a theme with this brand of books - like the potty book. While these books are cute I wish there wasn't negativity in them."
5,Echinacea Extract Caplets,This is probably my third order for this product. I find that it is by far the best one for me on the market. I am unable to swallow gel-caps and these are so much easier to take. I take three per day to keep my immune system at its peak. Thank you for the great product.
3,Don't use it with compact fluorescent bulbs!!,"I have four of these SFSQ-LF switches in my house. The fan slider works perfectly. The lamp toggle switch is only rated for *incandescent* and *halogen* bulbs. What's missing there? Right, no compact flourescent bulbs. Unfortunately my ceiling fans have mini base bulbs (candelabra base), and I use CF bulbs to get decent light output without huge heat. Also to save power. The CF bulbs apparently draw a huge surge at start and this surge causes the switch to fail after several years. I can hear it sparking internally and I guess that damages the contacts. Eventually the switch simply will not turn on the lamp anymore. Lutron has been good about replacing them even though I am not following the prescribed use."
5,Worked perfectly,I needed an on/off switch for the light (it has a non-dimmable LED) and a low/med/hi for the fan and couldn't find it in stores anywhere. This was exactly what I needed.
4,Kickin Ass!,"You dumb cracks who diss this CD clearly have no taste in music. This CD was simply awesome, it gets your blood pumpin-love it! You can say all the bull you want about the Crusher, but as he said he aint neva scared."
1,Disappointed........,This house is complete with everything except the DOLLS!!! The box does not indicate this. Now I am spending hours and more $$$$ to find the happy family dolls to go with this. Do not buy unless you have the Happy Family dolls first!
2,I love the Gasaraki series but this vol. flopped,"What can I say, volume 6 was not the quality I expect from the gasaraki series. The voice acting, sound effects, and surround quality were much worse than the preceding five volumes. I have come to expect a certain level of quality and depth of story/character in the series and this one just doesn't meet it. On the other hand, it is nice to see everything come together. The plan to rid Japan of the Chinese immigrants is now getting into swing but none of this is news. They took advantage of an interesting situation that took some intelligence to dream up (on the part of the writers) but nothing was really treated with the depth and detail that it usually is in this series. I expected more details on the grain shortage, Miharu didn't say a word, and they found refuge with some Chinese mafioso.... but the acting was piss poor. This vol. seems more like something they just had to get out of the way so the story could proceed to it's climax."
1,Don't do it!,"Go to a local jewelery shop. Ring sizing is not possible on line, and this company takes zero responsibility for the fact that you will most likely get it wrong. It brought a significant amount of misery to what was a very special day for me."
4,"Son though it was ""awesome""","Classic matches and memories! My son was really into this at one time but has found other interests since! When he did watch it, he said it was great! I'm sure one day he will watch it again! Hope you enjoy it too!"
3,Wierd set up of the ebook,"Because this book is several hundred years old I won't be a critic of the material. It is a classic and something everyone should read who wants to have a greater respect for where the church has been and how far it has come. That being said, I think there could have been a better way to organize the original material to make it more accessable in ebook format. I lost my place once and almost never found my way back to where I had been. This was the most difficult to navigate ebook I have bought."
2,beware the transalator,"Be aware that this is the Henry Cole transalation, not the J. I. Packer. There is a hugh difference in readability."
4,2 DIFFERENT Translations with the SAME Reviews,"Just a heads up: This translation is one of (atleast) 2 different translations of Martin Luther's work. Both Translations (this one and the one by Packer & Johnston) somehow are sharing the same reviews. I haven't read either myself, but lot of people are saying that this one was hurried, and not done thoroughly or clearly, and the Packer & Johnston is better, and unbiased (not by a Lutheran)...."
3,Classic Luther,"Martin Luther was a German Catholic monk in the 1500s who broke away from the Catholic church and founded Lutheran, the first Protestant denomination. Catholic baptizes infants while protestant baptizes those who are of age. Most Lutheran churches do both. Without Martin Luther there would be no freedom of religion. Not to be confused with Martin Luther King Jr., the civil rights activist. It teaches you get saved through baptism, which is an easy way to get saved. The dark side of Christianity is that you have to get saved in order to go to heaven. His Small Catechism remains a masterpiece of theological literature. There are 9 million Lutherans in America alone today, according to my sources. Congregational singing goes down in Lutheran worship service. He was a revolutionary thinker, way ahead of his time."
1,I hated this movie,"I was reading Ellen Burstyn's autobiography and I wanted to see her in one of her first movie roles. I didn't know anything about the movie except that it was considered dirty and explicit in 1970, but I thought it would be tame for today. I hated it. I had trouble getting all the way through it because I couldn't stand ALL of the characters in it (and Ellen Burstyn is only in the very beginning.)"
1,"Oh, If I Could Only Do It Again...I Wouldn't!","The 06 Flyer is a great looking stroller, but that's about all it has going for it. I purchcased it online, and wish I would have gone to a store to see it in person first. It's not at all what it's cracked up to be. The wheels are wonky, the steering's horrible, your feet bump into the stroller when it's in the 'facing mommy' position and even now that my baby's 7.5 months, the saftey straps are still too large!!I took a lot of time researching strollers online before purchasing this one, so I thought I did my homework...no such luck.A word to all stroller shoppers:1. Go to the store and test it out first2. Bring your baby along for the ride3. Check out online reviews...and if there aren't any then wait for some!I've just purchased my third stroller (awaiting it's arrival now) and hope it works out better for baby and me."
3,The size of the cork bark will vary,"This item arrived quickly, except it's smaller than what the description says. Mine arrived at 10"" by 9"", so size will vary. I needed it to be at least 12"" wide. It's just too bad. Going to have to return this one for an extra large just in case they undercut me again."
5,Link is awesome!,I don't care what all the other critics say about this movie. I think it's great. One of the best things about it is the music by Jerry Goldsmith. The acting and suspense scenes are some of the best in modern horror. I think it should be released on DVD instead of just VHS.
5,Innova Skeeter,"This disc is one of my favorite discs. It flies straight on just about any throw, and is very accurate. This is definitely a disc to have in your bag."
2,Disappointing,"This soundtrack features 29 tracks, and believe me, the handful of highlights are what you heard in the film. Not only are the interesting tracks too few and far between, but each is so short that the listener only gets one shot at the hook before the soundtrack moves on to something else. With a few exceptions, Confidence amounts to an uninventive hour with a drum machine. The movie, by contrast, is very cool and generally underrated. See it."
4,Excellent choice,"I purchase this for one reason, track two it's all about money and the intro. Some might sound dark odd emo type. Christope Beck delivers a perfected great music as well as the other artist. I would say at least 6 out of all were enjoyable."
4,It was what it was supposed to be,"I have no idea how you review some screening, but all I can see it was the same as you get from a Home Depot or Lowes, but they don't carry the 1/8"" size, only the 1/4"" so I purchased this online."
1,Some fundamental problems for English speakers,"I've noticed some glitches in the selection of vocabulary, but that's not the main problem for English speakers. It doesn't indicate the gender of the nouns in either the English-Norwegian or the Norwegian-English direction. And you can't speak or write Norwegian unless you know the gender of the nouns. And you can't tell the gender by looking at the word the way you can in Italian. A lesser complaint is that it doesn't mark the tone. Norwegian words have tone. Haugen's dictionary marks the tone. I speak Norwegian, and used this dictionary occasionally, because they have it at the office. I didn't notice that gender was missing for a year until a colleague tried to use it. Wow! No gender! What were they thinking?"
1,"bad album,with bad songs and a good voice",First i'd like to say that miss segara has a beautiful voice!!! but i prefer her first album and her second album i don't think she has choosen these songs she was obliged to sing them because it seems to be different of her personality. where is the simplicity?! now she is so superficial..... she is become a simply blond woman who sings like the others!!!!!!!
2,"Wow, how did MST 3000 miss this one",This movie must have been a tax write off. It was cheap. The acting was so bad it was almost funny. The CGI FX were ok. The plot and story were laughable. I liked goofing on this movie. Make sure your drinking when you watch this.This is just a bad movie.
2,"Buenos Aires, Argentina... The capital of Latin American Techno/Lounge/Chill Out music...???","I really liked two tunes of this 3-CD Argentinian production, I heard on a beach party few months ago.""Under The Sun"" sung by ORLEYA, a girl with a very interesting voice.""Be"", an instrumental/dubbing/vocal scherzo by the greatly unknown SUPERLOOP... However, an interesting Chill Out piece.The other tunes... Nothing remarkable. It seems all of them have been composed/performed and recorded in Buenos Aires, by local musicians.If the brief information is reliable, maybe some Brazilians also participated in this project.Anyway the album is worth to be listened, without further attention, while you sip your coffee and read the news on a boring Sunday morning... Or afternoon."
4,Very Good,"This is a very good CD. It has interesting themes and is mostly just songs about and to girls by a girl, which in itself makes it interesting. The CD is generally soft and often the songs are very similar. It is not amazing, but it is unique, very good, and definitely worth a purchase."
3,Early Paperback from Nelson DeMille,"Being a fan of Nelson DeMille, I couldn't resist trying one of his earlier works under pseudoname of ""Jack Cannon"". It was interesting to see his earlier writing ""style"" compared to his recent best sellers. The price is a bit high but since his earlier books must be out of print - the price to pay with the supply/demand curve being what it is. I'd like to find other earlier books of his but not at such high prices."
5,THE FUNNIEST SHOW EVER!!,"I have to add my review with everyone else,this is the Best & Funniest show that has ever been on! Not one episode goes by that I'm not laughing until I cry!! I'm keeping my fingers crossed that this show gets renewed this season. And along with the rest,Please release Season 6 a lot faster than this one!!"
5,I haven't seen it yet but I know it'll be good!,"I just wanted to say IT'S ABOUT TIME SONY!! No disrespect intended. But come on, why did it take so long to release season five?? I'm counting down the days until June 27 when it will arrive in my mailbox. I'm hoping and praying that it doesn't take this long for them to release season 6. So many crappy shows have their DVD sets released already..and King Of Queens blows them all away...the network should hang on to them for at LEAST 10 more seasons!! I am a DVD season set collector or ""junky"" if you will, and I am relieved season 5 is finally out!"
5,The only textbook I bought in my undergrad!,"This is the only textbook I bought in my undergrad days! It's so interesting (and funny! especially the 'Romeo & Juliet' bits) I couldn't bear to put it down. Covers basics from intuitive understanding of stability in systems and builds up to chaos and more difficult topics. For best results use it with Matlab and try out the Runge-Katta solver, plot the 'butterfly' attractors of the Lorenz equations... Great book."
1,too hard,"i remember these being soft and cushy. This was hard AS A ROCK and i returned it asap. For that amount of money, it needs to be softer."
3,adult studio chair sleeper - twin size,This is ok in a pinch - the biggest problem being the bolster section. Need to pad the sleeper with a folded quilt or good twin-size mattress cover - I found it abit hard without. The bolster is too round and uncomfortable for my head - turning it upside down worked better.
5,good buy,The chair is a vood value. The fabric is good quality and it is large enough for a adult and is confortable.Shipping was prompt too..It was a on the pricey is is the only complaint I have.
3,Convenient but hard to clean,"Good: Nicely designed, changes from chair to bed instantly.Downside: Quite hard. It takes a long time to wear down and become comfortable.Also, it's incredibly difficult to clean. The chair is four pieces, each with their own tight zipper. Make sure you know how to spot-clean, because you're not going to be able to get this into the washer."
2,European Railway info only,"Fine book for the EUROPEAN railroad fan. Good content and illustrations. However, my disappointment is that it does NOT include information about the American Railroads."
1,Poor workmanship,Looks good and has a nice blade but arrived with one of the brass plates on the butt missing. I have seen other reviews saying the same thing. I would have fixed it but the brass plate was not in the box.
5,Excellent resource,"This is easily one of the best cookbooks I've ever seen, and by far the most comprehensive resource on baking I've ever come across.The book goes in depth on just about every baking subject--weighing, tools, ingredients, you name it. Though they highly recommend measuring ingredients by weight, they provide both weight and volume measures in the recipes. Speaking of recipes, they are bountiful, and range from basics and classics to more advanced/atypical (in a good way).If you're a home cook, or anyone who just wants to know more about baking, you should seriously consider buying this book. It is worth it."
4,nice book,"I love this book as I am learn how to make cakes and cookies.So far I tried couple of them, some of them did not come out well but I learned how to make the good ones."
4,"Good movie, bad DVD...","Graveyard Shift is a wonderful, interesting, vampire movie. A vampire is a taxi driver who works the night shift. As he picks up passengers he picks his victims from those who are at the end of their rope. People, in this case sexy women, who wish to kill themselves. He turns them into vampires. They become part of a vampire network which keeps him supplied with blood and gives the women a reason to live. In other words he turns almost suicides into vampires which is a nice link to folklore vampires. The problem is he falls in love and screws up what was a pretty nice setup and life style. The only problem I have is with the DVD. I have seen the movie before on tape and on the DVD many scenes were either too dark or just too unfocused to see. It looks like they got as bad copy, which is sad because otherwise it is a good film. Also, sorry to say, there are no extras outside of some trailers."
4,vampire,i really liked this dvd im a big fan of vampire movies ive been wanting this dvd for a long time im glad amazon had it
2,"erotic, but disappointing","Central Park Drifter had potential, but lacked good acting abilities. DVD has a good cover, nudity, sex, and violence."
4,Phil Me Up,"I was very fortunate to see both shows which make up this DVD. This is really the last show with this lineup.While Phil and Bobby make up Furthur, this DVD documents the ending of Phil Lesh shows. There was 1 more lineup with Jackie Greene after this group but this one was the last of the Dead Style Jams.The musicians are all fantastic and interplay is magical.Jay Blakesberg does a great job capturing the moments on stage. He is renowned for his photography work with his favorite subject, the Grateful Dead. He takes some risks with his video camera but in the end he is just a spectator witnessing the magic on the stage.Jerry owned this venue through the 80s and the 90s. Phil took up residents there after the millennium. Check out the ""Phil Lesh"" show as it went down in a little theater on Market street in SF. ""..got to calling it home!"""
5,Very Pleased,"We are extremely happy with the Hooked On Phonics package we ordered from Amazon. The Hooked On Phonics great reputation is well deserved. The instructions are very easy to follow and the results are almost immediate. The price I paid with Amazon was a tremendous savings, and I had chekced several places on the price. Take the chance you will be glad you did."
3,Heavy,Beautiful dinnerware but way to heavy. I ended up selling on ebay. But it is a very nice looking dinnerware. I prefer the lighter corelle. So I went back to the original corelle in a neutral pattern. I wish they had more Corelle in solid colors instead of patterns etc. Like the stoneware colors would be great.
1,Didn't order them,I never ordered the round dishes. I wanted two sets of the square not round. I received the square but had to send the round ones back which cost me money.
5,Excellent dinnerware,"I brought this dinnerware for my daughter and her husband, we were especially pleased that this was shipped earlier than expected and arrived in perfect condition. It is a beautiful set of dinnerware that is quality made. I don't work for corning ware, however a good friend introduced me to the corelle products 25 years ago and I have loved them ever since. You can use corelle products in any type of dinner situtaion. This dinnerware I plan on buying for myself just in a different color."
1,not the correlle mom always used,"i bought 2 sets of these dishes,one red set and one green...both boxes had broken dishes and plates...my thought was ""unbelievable"",they are very heavy dishes and look sturday and durable but the way they were broken in the box and in 2 boxes at that,i would not recommend these."
3,A lot of Bang for your buck,"I bought this DVD rather blindsightedly, if thats a word. I had read a lot about Christofer Lee and Hammer in the ""Vampire Book"" and seen a few of their Hammer flicks on TMC, so I thought...I was surprised by the quality of the plot and the acting (not Lee though) good sets too but not particularly atmospheric. It isn't clear what period or locale this is (I don't remember the end to ""To Drink the Blood..."") but it is obvious that the barmaids referring to the cops as ""pigs"" is an anachronism because Abbie Hoffman coined it a few years before this was made.You get a lot of stuff on this DVD, which is partly my justification for the impulse buy. You get the movie, an animate slide show and two trailers on the first disc, and Christofer Lee's Documentary and a couple of Music videos on the other. The Documentary is cool, but it seems like Lee is just showing us stuff he has in his house."
1,"Buyer, beware! Not the collectible version.","Be advised that the version of ""Scars Of Dracula"" that Amazon is currently selling is an expurgated release that misleads the customer with its cover art. This has a single disc and the featured film only, and the other with 2 amazing music videos and the ""Faces Of Christopher Lee"" documentary that made this an attractive collectible has been removed, in spite of what the packaging still claims. The lobby card art is also missing inside, so buyer, beware. ""Scars Of Dracula"" isn't bad as a latter entry in the Lee Dracula canon. It's spoiled slightly, though, by jarringly fake and excessive gore, with regrettably gratuitous sadism. Christopher Lee felt similarly, as optional on-screen commentary attests. My rating here's for the chopped-up reissue."
3,Hammer Films last Gothic Dracula film,"""Scars of Dracula"" is the most uneven of the Hammer Dracula films. Highlighted by scenes of unusal violence and sadism (if that's your cup of tea), the film is hurt by terrible art direction, due no doubt to an attempt by Hammer Films to tighten the purse strings. Too bad too, because all the other elements are here for a top notch Dracula entry. Still far better and more enjoyable than contemporary horror fodder."
4,"""The Emperor's Choice"": almost incomprehensible!","Although this album does not quite measure up to his later work, particularly ""Steel String Stories"", one track stands out. Employing a rather simple but stunning melodic element, Chris Proctor executes ""The Emperor's Choice"" with a technique that is most impressive. The song sounds more like a two-guitar piece, but as I witnessed him perform it solo, I can confirm that it is simply a gifted musician and his willing instrument weaving through a fabric of musical beauty."
4,CH in the lean years and a family connection,"This DVD set is a collection over CH's earliest work, including Peer Gynt where he was only 17. He was in the film club at New Trier High School during the time it was filmed, my uncle (who has a bit acting part but was also one of the camera men) was also a member of the club. This was filmed (as well as Julius Creaser) by David Bradley, later directed one of the worst sci-fi films of all time. All in all it is a nice collection of early films and TV shows."
1,QT not QP type breaker,"Note this is described as both a QT and QP breaker. It is in fact a QT breaker, which will not substitute for a QP. The other way around may be true."
4,Great show trapped under Sony,"The show is great, but Sony needs to stop being so stubborn, get the real 'Love and Marriage' theme music back, and why no bonuses? How much can it possibly cost to throw in a few bloopers? Those are funny and they must have hundreds of them lying around. I can't fault the show, though.. Al Bundy is truly the King, and he has some of the best lines like ""GET OUT OF THE WAY, BEHEMOTH!"" to a fat woman immediately after promising God he'd be nice to everyone in a prayer, if only Kelly could win a modelling job. That cracks me up every time, no matter how many times I see it. Some people don't like Ted McGinley, but I think he does a good job as Jefferson. He really bonds well with Al in the later seasons.. I am looking forward to those later seasons for two reasons: Big'uns magazine, and No Ma'am! Can't wait! Bottom line is Married With Children easily runs rings around the newer ""comedies?"" that networks spew out today."
2,Told You So Awhile Ago,"I wrote a review for season one, saying basically that this series was one of the best written and acted for a comedy, for the first 5 years...Actually 4 and a half. Season 5 has some good episodes, but other negative reviewers pointed out correctly how the show changed from funny, to mean and cartoonish.This is a good forum so people can read what others think about a show before they buy it. Unfortunately most of you that vote are devout fans of this and others series, and will say it was not helpful even if it was...The other reviewers are right on...Season 1-4 great, Season 5 showing a big downgrade, then bombs away with quality after that.Jerry"
1,Not recommended,"This CD is very poorly recorded. It has a great deal of hiss and sounds like it was recorded in a bucket. Furthermore, the last track is apparently missing from the disc. A better choice is ""From The Jungles of Paraguay - John Williams plays Barrios"" - I can HIGHLY recommend this one, fabulous recording and performance."
4,It's a freakin Circuit breaker,"Either you bought the correct make & model and were happy with the price - or you don't know how to order circuit breakers and got mad.Me, i was the former -- but again, hard to review a circuit breaker -- ""It correctly stops the flow of electricity when you click off""I guess if it didn't work right, i would get electrocuted and not be able to write a review - so keep that in mind if it's all 4 or 5 stars for this item"
2,NOT the next Robert Ludlum,"The story has lots of intrigue, but the writing is dull and lifeless and tedious to read. Written for people who don't have more than a third-grade level of reading skill. Not a single nice turn of phrase in the entire book. Dialog doesn't sparkle. Neither does Badel give us any reason to care about his characters. Just a bunch of cardboard people running around, and all too often doing rather dumb things. Too often I found myself saying, ""Good Grief, no one would do that!"" Sorry, but it all bored me."
5,Budget Management,When I purchased this book I thought it might be outdated for my organization. I was wrong - this is an excellent budget WORKBOOK. The author did an excellent job in bringing the complex and problematic issues of budgeting for Nonprofit organizations and takes you step by step into the process. The book covers everything from the start of the budget to financial reporting of the budget. This book also provides numerous samples of budgets. If your a budget manager or director - this book should give a fresh new way to look at the budgeting process.
3,Better for a kid or an elderly person,"I bought this trike so I could get a little fun and exercise while nursing a broken foot (I'm 38). It does NOT go fast at all -- you reach the max speed very quickly, and at that point the pedals just flop around. The neighborhood kids LOVE it and ask to borrow it all the time. It IS a fun little ride, with the steering allowing you drift through turns. (It can tip over, though.) I wouldn't use it for serious exercise, though."
4,I need ti for a present,"Thanks, my son need this to paint some toys he purchase, and I didn't know where to find this kind of stuff"
5,Really Great!,"Inca has been one of my favorite characters from past Morgans Mercenaries. She has always been so mysterious and powerful. I was hoping as we got to know her, she wouldn't lose that mystique. ALL'S WELL! Inca and Roan both walked a fine line between power and emotion. They were a fantastically well matched pair. The only way to describe these two is, PASSIONATE, STRONG, AND DETERMINED!The mission to destroy drug labs in the amazon basin was definitely only a mild diversion. Even the bad blood between the Colonel leading the mission and Inca (their guide), barely caused a ripple. The focus is firmly on Inca and Roan just as it should be. This story is more 'mystical' than the previous Morgans Mercenaries. Some people may not enjoy that as much but it was perfect for a story about Inca. TERRIFIC!"
2,It makes the ulcer moist but becomes a sticky mess,"I purchased this for a relative's Stage II decubitus ulcer. You have to place the film on the ulcer. The ulcer stays moist which is supposed to help heal it. It was a sticky mess when I tried to remove the film after 2 days, the instructions indicate it can stay in place for 7 days, but a sticky mess results. I've only tried it twice, and I'm not sure I used it as directed."
5,EXCELLENT,Terrific for wound covering-- can't get a better opinion in my opinion.This is a good price as well.It lasts a long time and works great.5 STARS.
2,Disappointed,This set disappointed me on several issues. The color was more on the mauve or burgundy tone. The dinner plates are too large to fit into my dishwaher. Silverware slides onto the floor on a regular basis because of the rounded corners and my spoon falls into the bowl. 2 plates have cracked for no apparent reason. Overall these have been frustrating and disappointing dishes.
2,Too Big,Arrived with a bowl broken in half. Much heavier than expected and too big to fit in my dishwasher.
4,Better Than He Expected,"I was looking for dinnerware that was red & black. In my search I found the Corelle Hearthstone Chili Red Square set. The color was just what I was looking for. But my husband wasn't sure because he was thinking of the Corelle that he grew up with and thought it would be thin, despite what the description said. Was he ever surprised when we took it out of the box. This is heavy and great looking dinnerware. Just what I wanted, and we love the square shape. Thanks Corelle for the Hearthstone Dinnerware!"
3,"Good, but not what I was expecting...","Our kitchen in the new house will have all red appliances and accents, so we figured we would have everything red, so we decided to get these. These plates are great. I have yet to use them, however, I know they are going to be great. They aren't as red as shown in the picture. They are just a darker red, like blood red. They are a lot heavier than I was expecting, however, I think they will be more durable. The bottom of the dinnerware are jet black, not shiny at all. They are also labeled as microwave safe and dishwasher safe, hopefully this is a true statement."
3,Almost perfect,"I love the look of the red and black square design. There are three problems I have with these dishes. 1. The large dinner plate is LARGE! Doesn't fit in certain cupboards and has to go in lower one making it hard to get to. 2. Very heavy, must have muscles to carry all the plates. 3. over a minute in the microwave the plate is so hot it WILL burn you. must use hot pads!!! Other then that I really do like the plates. We normally just use the smaller dinner plates. they are a much better size and you know you wont over load your plate with food. LOVE the mugs. They have to be the best part of the set!!"
3,disappointed,"Very excited with our new dinnerware, very stylish ann beautiful but we started to notice that the plates and the cups get very easily scratched with forks, knives and even spoons..... we replaced our old and nice Corelle dinner for this nicer just to realize this disappointment"
2,Corelle Hearthsone Stoneware,"I have not used this very long, and even though it says chip proof, one piece has already chipped. The stoneware is much heavier than I anticipated as well. The color is very nice. I am sorry that I bought it."
4,Very Large and heavy,"I like this dinnerware set a lot. The dinner plates are so large that they barely fit into my dishwasher, but they do. The cups are also very big and can easly be used as a soup/stew mug. I have been using the smaller sandwich plates as dinner plates. The color is just as shown, dark chili red (not bright or cherry red)."
2,Characters never stay in their seats!,"Ridiculous to make the characters have specific feet for their seats - and they are all different, so you MUST put them just where they go - they are not interchangeable. Too much trouble for a frustrated toddler. I tossed it after a few weeks into the donation bin when he wasn't looking. Silly, silly, silly."
1,Ridiculous,"I'm not rating this toy, because it's a great toy, for kids who love Little Einsteins. I'm rating the fact that it's $400. Ridiculous. Who would buy this for that price?"
4,"On the Loud Side, but Fun","I bought this for my 4 yr old son and he enjoys playing with it! The only thing is that it is LOUD. A solution I find myself doing on many toys we buy, is place clear tape over the speakers. What a difference!It is also a bit on the heavy side, so my son just rolls it on the floor or on tables. Worth the purchase is your child is a fan of the Little Einsteins!"
4,Little Einstein Rocket Review,I bought this item for my 2-year-old granddaughter who is a Little Einstein fanatic. She loved it and plays with it constantly. She has a great imagination so this toy has many adventures with her. Amazon got this item to me in just a few days - great service!
4,Favorite Toy!,"This is my daughter's favorite toy! I bought this for her for Christmas because she loves the little Einsteins and was always pretending and acting out the episodes. She has played with it every day since Christmas. I chose this over the Transforming Rocket toy because only one figure can sit in the Transforming Rocket and it only comes with 2 characters. This one has all four. They must sit in the correct seats and they are seated as they are on the show.I agree it is a little loud, but my daughter tends to use her imagination and act out her ""missions"" rather than turn it on. She is 5 so it is not too heavy for her. So far, we are very pleased with this toy!"
1,What did I watch?,"I wish I could have given it no star's. 99 cent special from Amazon. Thought I would check it out. After watching the movie, I want my money back. Don't bother watching this waste of 97 minutes."
3,The divine status of the 1200rpm spin cycle,"You can't fault McMorrow's aspirations - FRANKLYN is an ambitious film, especially as a first-time feature, and although he's overstretched himself somewhat, this is an interesting piece of cinema. It owes debts to several more successful films, such as Dark City and V for Vendetta. The satire and imagery are a little heavy-handed, and it's miscast, with only Bernard Hill truly convincing in his role. And yet despite these faults it remains a compelling, if disjointed, story about fractured minds, destiny, and lovelorn loneliness."
1,More waste of time than money!,I would buy another copy if it would give me the 20 minutes back I spent watching this video. I put it on FF X3 speed and watched it all in 20 minutes... was still pissed.
4,its wire,"Its wire, and it works. I used it to rewire my motorcycle. I'm not sure what else you can write in a review about wire."
5,"A beautiful, uplifting album","Spirited and hopeful, never mawkish or preachy. The songs fit together, giving the disc grace and power."
1,Bunneymen - Where For Art Thou ?,"This disc is incredibly boring. Very typical of McCulloch's solo work. Very untypical of the vintage Echo & the Bunneymen that sound that gave him ""voice""."
4,beatle-tastic!,"This shirt is awesome, really well done, the image on it is great and the shirt quality is excellent...Too bad it was delivered one size bigger that I originally ordered. But excellent shirt nonetheless"
3,A silent film is suposed to be silent,"All I can tell is that the documentary is boring, and the form how the short films are articulated with the structure of the presentation makes me wanna cry, because for starting, the short films are played with the voice of an old lady who's explaining the film (i believe i can understand it by myself), and this voice over is un-remouvable. And the editor sometimes puts plans of the pianist playing, letting me the impression that film has not passed completely. The only thing good is the films of this visionaire."
3,Interesting reading,"This book is for everyone at some point in their life. The content is good based on what ""time"" of your life and what ""situtation"" you are in at the time you decide to read it."
4,Intriguing story about two friends and their dreams.,"A great story about two men who spend their days going from farm to farm looking for work. They finally come upon a stable job which would pay them enough money to fulfill their dreams. The two men want to buy a ""place"" of their own and have had this dream for a long time. Tragically their hopes are shattered when one of the men commits a crime so great, that he ends up dying for it."
2,Hagen Quartett plays Mozart string quartets,"The lead violin is very harsh, even grating. I own other versions of these Mozart strng quartets and am on the verge of tossing this set out. Mort"
5,What a fantastic book!!!!!,"All of the characters are so well-defined you can almost see them.They make you laugh, warm your heart & sometimes bring a tear to your eye.This is Southern Humor at it's best!! You've gotta read this one!!!!!"
3,Nice but disappointing,"I was expecting photos of the old greats...Muscat,Bask,Huckleberry Bey etc, also more body shots of the horses. When I saw Padron on the cover I thought ""wow, I can finally find a book with some pictures of Padron in it""....not!It is a really nice book with excellent photography of horses but not the horses I expected.Also I agree with a previous rating that the book is too thin and could have been of more substance. Not a great tribute to such a great photographer.....too bad."
3,valve works good,"quality of valve very good, it shipped on time and there were no problems with the installation or fit. Will buy more of these valves form this vendor."
3,Works great....but only for a year!,"This was a great product and did a great job until this morning (it stopped working). Today, while using the product I noticed a variation on the pressure and suddenly no pressure at all, now it just makes noise but no water comes out. Warranty if over for me, so I will try to take it apart and try to fix it. I will definitely miss this product but will not buy again from waterpik unfortunately. Hope I can find something better."
1,WaterPik WP-70/WP-70W,"I had to return my recent purchase due to a defect. I have used WaterPik Dental Water Jets for many, many years and typically have to replace every two or three years. I was disappointed to receive a defective product but began shopping locally for another dental water jet. I purchased the WaterPik Ultra, and I am pleased with the design, size and operation thus far. I just hope WaterPik can maintain quality of their products and that my current purchase will provide another two to three years of service."
1,Worked once (sort of) and the pump quit!,"BUYER BEWARE! MY UNIT QUIT THE SECOND TIME I TRIED TO USE IT!Reading the reviews, I am not alone. I am so suprised because my dentist said it was the best thing going. Maybe another product will work better.Believe me, I will read those reviews BEFORE I buy the thing."
2,Good while it's working,"I've had two waterpiks over the years. I liked them both, when they worked, as they had plenty of pressure. Both died in about two years though, one with a hose leak, and my latest one, which died today, leaking in the attachment handle. I need the machine, so I'm torn about what to do. I bought another brand (Teledyne) about 4 years ago, and was not really happy with the lower cleaning pressure it produced, so when it croaked, I bought the second Waterpik, which cleaned well, but doesn't last either.I sure wish I could get more than 2 years out of these units. I only use them once or twice a week, so that's a pretty short working life span, I'd say."
4,WP-70,"Does what it is supposed to do. A little bit noisy. This is my second unit. My first cracked around the base of the handle and began to leak after 2.5 years. Overall, an A-minus."
1,Don't buy this Waterpik!,This is a piece of junk. Why is the company still producing this model? It wasn't even three weeks before it stopped working--no power and it sounds like a jack hammer. I want to buy another oral irrigator but I'm reluctant to trust any Waterpik product. I do not want to give it even one lousy star.
3,Quality not so great,"The strength (power?) is controlled by a slider on the handle sucks compared to the old (when I was a kid) way it used to be controlled by a knob on the unit.The slider on the handle isa: very easy to bump it up from 2 to 6 and powerwash a gouge in your mouthb: inaccurate. It should go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 but the one on mine is more like 1, 2, 5, 5, 5, 6Otherwise, it does what it says. I have yet to be back to the dentist to see if it's helping thoughI asked a few dentists for advise - Unless told otherwise, don't use this every day. You can do damage to your gums. Also, it's not a substitute for regular flossing. It's better at getting below the gumline, but doesn't do as well above it."
5,LOVE IT! Seriously one of my favorite CDs,"I love the CDs made by the BYU Choirs. They're all fabulous, but this one is seriously one of my favorites. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!"
5,GOLDY ROCKS THIS!,This cd is FABULOUS! I have known Goldy a long time and so much passion and effort went into this cd. Pick it up you will not be disappointed!!!
4,Flow master,The clamps with the kit were cheap I ha drop buy different ones. And the Over the axle pip hits the rear end when I hit bumps but other then that it's nice kite for the price sounds good
2,Chocolate Artistry Review,"Even though the cover is in colour, the book is so old that all photos inside are in black and white. Because of this it loses a lot of appeal. Actual techniques are good, but because of the poor graphics (because of its age) it's not very useful (not knowing that it is black and white could be lack of research on my behalf)."
3,Small,"This is my second time ordering zoo med cork bark. My first order was a good size for the price. So I decided to order another small round piece of cork. Well, this time it was half the size of the first one I ordered. Pretty disappointed the second time. I would be careful and make sure you get what you paid for!! The reason why I choose this merchant is that I am getting free 2 day shipping trial for a month."
4,Very soothing,"Great music to lay back and listen to with a bottle of wine and the right girl by your side. Very soothing and relaxing, I recommend the wine, the girl and of course the album."
1,Untold Things,"There is a song on this album called ""Calls, Cries and Clamors"". Well that's about the whole album. Unintelligible ""Calls"", Weird ""Cries"" with a background of ""Clamor""."
2,Great example of how difficult comedy must be.,"As a whole, the collection is a disappointment, but there are some individual performances that absolutely succeeded and are certainly worth a listen. If it were up to me, I'd advise someone buy mp3 versions of these standouts.Eugene Mirman is always a win and Todd Barry's crowd-interactive routine is notable, but it was Aziz Ansari, to me, that really stood out.Sadly, I thought David Cross fell flat, and he was the reason I bought the cd.I was torn between the two and three-star rating because there are some gems, but the album as a whole just wasn't worth my time. There is a definite contrast in performances which created an awkward herd-thinning experience that I probably won't sit through again.I only burned a few to my itunes and called it even.- t -7 July, 2010"
3,Ateco 475 Meringue Powder might be shipped as Americolor Meringue Powder,"***DO NOT ORDER FROM TCP CORP!*** Seller does not allow feedback, does not provide a mechanism for return and does not respond to customer inquiries.I ordered Ateco 475 Meringue Powder, 10 oz (as pictured above) and received Americolor Meringue Powder,10 oz."
2,I don't like it.,Useless for baking. This is the first time to buy this powder for cake and regret to buy it. Never use it for icing .
2,If it wasn't for ICE-T this movie would be running on empty...,"This is pretty much a copycat of PASSENGER 57, which is a better movie...If it wasn't for ICE-T I wouldn't have cared to follow the movie through... Besides him the movie is pretty much a waste of time and money...Ice-t Does NOT have the lead in the movie which I thought, his character doesn't get in the movie until like 40 minutes has past, Kim Noja (or whatever she's called) has the leadand she isn't to great (u might know her as the flat one in SON OF THE BEACH)...I'd recommend you watch STEALTH FIGHTER if u want to see a movie feautring planes and ice-T instead... Not the best movie neither but it sure is funny..."
1,Failed,I purchased this carrying case and took it on a business trip. The wheel became loose and tilted inward rubbing against the wheel shield making it impossible to pull.Poor quality . I returned it to Amazon and am patiently waiting for a credit.This process is taking too long. Much longer than an ordering process.. Why ??Paul D.Vesely
3,"Good, but not as good","I bought this cd because of my long-lived affection for the Up Evil and Off discs. Even Official Version is quite good. This one falls a bit short of the mark, in my opinion. Those other two discs are far more interesting. This is still, however, a good listen, but it won't blow you away as the first two I've mentioned will"
2,"When techno pioneers get old, do their listeners?","...That's what these guys are banking on. I was sorely disappointed with this release and still and raw. What happened? I can understand that musicians need to grow and their music should reflect that, but on first listen to this release I am left wondering what songs didn't make the cut.I have visited the Front 242 website for a few years to see if there has been any current news for release of new material and I have to admit the loops they have running in the background of the site are far more enticing than this.Thank golly I bought these for a fraction of the price on eBay.Maybe I can listen to this when I'm 50+ and need some subtle tweaking to get me through the day.Songs worth mention: NONEDamn..."
5,army wives 2,"army wives 2 is the greatest. i especially love catherine bell and kim delaney, they make all the episodes really good. but all the characters in the show are good actors or actresses. i can watch army wives over and over again. i work 2 jobs and i make sure i'm off on sunday's just to watch the greatest show in the world."
1,These reviews are about the produt at hand,"i'm getting really tired of reading these michael jackson reviews giving him 1's over all that kid stuff. Sure, i agree thats pretty bad but this shouldnt be about personal opinions on the person it should be about music. Michael Jackson is one of the greatest enertainers ever, he basically made mtv and all these stupid jokes and comments are getting really old. This is a good michael jackson greatest hits,its got jackson 5 stuff, the jacksons stuff, and of course his solo hits, there may be a few left out but all in all if its a greatest hits you want,this is a good one."
4,"Great, but not GREAT!!!!!","As far as ""essential"" compilations go, you'd be hard pressed to find a more stellar collection of hits than this. However, like most greatest hits CDs, there always seem to be one or two omissions that really should have been included. The five most glaring cuts: ""Dancing Machine,"" ""Working Day and Night,"" ""State of Shock,"" ""Scream"" and ""Break of Dawn.""All that aside, you're still left with the goods from Mr. Jackson's most celebrated albums, ""Thriller"" and ""Bad."" Sure, it would've been nice had ""This Place Hotel"" been thrown in to the mix, but with the stuff from both the Jackson 5 and The Jacksons included, this is a pretty sweet deal for the price.I was fortunate enough to come across the limited edition 3.0, which includes a third disc featuring the songs:Can't Get Out of the RainSay, Say, Say (with Paul McCartney)JamThey Don't Care About UsBlood On the Dance FloorStranger In Moscowand Butterflies"
2,Let me explain.,"I gave this album 2 stars not for lack of how brilliant all the music is on this compilation, but the fact that this is how many Gr. hits albums now? We first get HIStory, thin the first disk alone, then the #1's then the box set and now this. They are all great songs, but in this day with online downloading and so many previous ""hits"" albums in the can what do they expect out of us. Anybody that is a fan of MJ's music already has whatever songs they want already, and if they are new fans they are just going to download them anyway. It is no longer a market for Gr. Hits albums, when an artists entire library is available at the click of a button. Besides who doesn't own billie jean somewhere on some form in there collection. Hey MJ why don't you put some new material out, that I might think about buying."
4,MJ,"You could say whatever you wanna say about Michael but you can't deny the man's music is infectious. Yes, it has gone down the drain a bit lately with his last couple of releases. But you'd need a tight compilation like this to remind you of why the man was once historical and why there's still a chance for him to reconquer his throne. I'm one of the first to say that I'd love to see him evolve musically at this point in his career. I'm not sure that's a risk he's willing to take though. But I feel it's so urgently needed for his career to explode again. At this point it wouldn't hurt to try.What prevents me from giving this compilation a 5 star rating is that it's missing some of his best tracks such as Earth Song and Scream. How were they not included?! And yes, it's great that some of the Jackson 5 songs were dropped in but how about I'll be there?! Otherwise this is a great compilation worth obtaining for your music collection!"
4,This is soooooo much better than the stock ear wraparound,I bought this to replace the stock ear wraparound because I found that my ear would start hurting after minutes of wearing that device. This makes the device so pleasant to use and I can talk on it for pretty much any extended period of time that I've come across. It also fits nicely on the charger while attached to this headband.
4,Worked well,"The charger sparked a couple times during the first 10 uses (when I plugged it into the wall outlet) and then it stopped and worked normally after that. A little scary, but haven't had any problems since then. The product arrived on time and was as described."
5,Very nice holster!,"I don't like the plastic holsters, love the leather & suede so this is right up my alley. Very much recommended product & seller"
4,Another WWF Success,"Once again, Vince McMahon and the WWF have put out another quality DVD. GREEN is basically a history on the WWF Hardcore Title, not to mention some of the more prominent hardcore matches.GREEN could have shown more, but that is what marketing is all about. This DVD can't have everything. What it does have is the amazing street fight match between the Legend of Hardcore, Cactus Jack a.k.a. Mick Foley, and the greatest professional in the business, Triple H. There are several other excellent matches, including the much talked about match between Al Snow and the Road D-O-Double G.GREEN is hosted by Tazz, who is quickly becomming a superstar on the microphone. He has had his fair share of hardcore matches, and using him on this DVD was a good choice. The picture quality is superb and the sound is excellent. This is a really good DVD and a worthy purchase for any fan of professional wrestling."
3,Just ok.,"This was my third of Jordan's Conan Books, and, unfortunately, my least favorite. All three were nearly identical... so maybe I was just bored at this point and you may well think I am nuts. But frankly, I recommend you skip this one unless you plan to read EVERY Conan book ever written.In CONAN the UNCONQUERED, the barbarian once again arrives in a new city looking for a way to fill his pockets with gold and manages to end up knee deep in trouble. As usual, he does some bar crawling, sleeps with some gorgeous women, and after a variety of brawls, he of course stops the evil wizard.-If you are looking for more ""Wheel of Time"" you are likely to be disappointed -but it is fun watching Jordan hone his skills.-As far as Conan goes, I hear R E Howard's works are the best -so you might want to look there instead. That's next for me as well."
5,These stories are not for the Lovecraft uninitiated...,"This collection of work ranks as my second favorite, falling just short of ""At the Mountains of Madness"" also published by Arkham house. It contains most of his earlier works, and does a better job providing the reader with a glimpse of the forces which shaped his work through the years than any other collection could hope to. If you are new to Lovecraft, these works would probably not be appreciated as much as others. They are much more enjoyable when one has a better understanding of what Lovecraft is all about. I would suggest starting with the collection ""The Dunwich Horror and Others"" also by Arkham house. It contains most of Lovecraft's most popular work, including ""The Call of Cthulhu"" and ""The Colour out of Space"". For any fan or collecter of Lovecraft, however, this book is an absolute must have."
5,"The beginning , and still the best.","I cannot even explain how much this game affected me. I was a gamer for 5 years or so before this came out in 1994. The instant i installed it, i was drawn in. And, i have never looked back. The plot, incredible. The graphics , 3 years AHEAD of its' time! The graphics now look dated, but the game will always be great. This was an early 'Looking Glass' game! Those guys went on to do THIEF! If you've never heard of System Shock before, go on this... There has never been a more powerful team than 'Looking Glass','Origin', and 'Modern Age Books'! Those three collaberated on this outstanding classic PC game. I was even able to get this to run on my XP system! (Athlon). I hope every gamer gets the chance to play this at least once. It will show them how greatness began!"

4,You'll learn how far we've come!,"I read this book to learn what records might exist for a divorce and dower in connection with genealogy research. It is extremely thorough and detailed for the several states Salmon researched. It was very enlightening about the legal status of women, especially how their situations varied state to state. Some readers may find the book a rough go--the law can be a very dry subject. As an attorney myself, I appreciated the hair splitting differences she presented. I found even the notes and extensive bibliography useful for locating other materials to read."
3,No Such Place nearly satisfies.,"The album had a good feel from start to finish but never seems to deliver. I think it needs a little more Johnny Cash and a little less, I don't know, pop."
3,This book is for novices only,"As a two year WebObjects develoer, I bought this book in hopes that it would help me learn how to implement some of the new powerful features in WebObjects 5. Unfortunately, there is very little code and examples and no CD Rom. It is 90% theory about general WebObjects and databse concepts that anyone using WebObjects for more than a few months should already know.If you are new to WebObjects and would like to know what you can accomplish with the product, the book is decent. I give it 3 stars for that.-Neil"
1,Gillis,"As a child she was remarkable; however, as a young lady she is quite unremarkable. Her talent has not increased with age; furthermore, she has developed an odd public persona in which she seems comfortable playing the role of tart and musical savant.I had expected something much more promising; however, the best that can now be said of her is that she is typical."
2,"GOOD voice ,BAD writing.","Charlotte Church can sing. what she Can't do is write. in fact I'm not all that sure she wrote all of this book herself. I think its more then likely that she had a ghost writer to help her. this book does give some good info about charlottes life and early career, but there is really WAY to much about her family. she also says that she read wuthering heights by Jane Austen. right. bottom line: get her CDs not her book. our get this book from the library like I did."
4,Get you basics cleared here!,"Good Book to get familiar with the jargon thrown at you by the realtors. Also covers some mortgage related history, math you need to know while answering the basic questions you have..."
2,Compact in size but not very practical,"On the plus side, it is relatively more compact than other portable oral irrigators. But the negatives outweigh the positive. First, the jet is too weak to clean effectively. Second, the reservoir is too small. I needed multiple refills to make one clean."
4,Beautiful Baseball Book,"To begin with, my father is prominently featured in the same photo twice (alas, no photo caption). Loved the photo. This book has always been one of my favorite baseball books (my dad loved it too), because it is more of a picture-book. The colorful cover, the photos inside. Baseball just comes alive in this book for me. For statistics and other records, I might go to other books, but in general, SMOKE is the one I recommend to baseball fans."
1,Waste of time... repetitive !!!!!,"I am a big user of Priceline; it is a great website, and offers amazing discounts. I am pretty familiar with how it works, and I do not understand how this guide helps users get better rates. It is repetitive... not much info!Dont waste your money on this book!!!!"
5,Judgement Day I liked!,I liked this Judgement Day.Had a bunch of jam packed matches and excitement.Oh and by the way D@mn you Vince for screwing the Undertaker!Is your head really that far up your @ss!
5,Informative and Helpful for Understanding IB,"Beginning to research the IB program for my district, I purchased this book plus a few others to help me better understand the program and the benefits to beginning IB in a rural district. With the history of IB and the case studies from a few schools, this book gave me a good understanding of what IB should look like. It also gave me an excellent understanding of where IB came from and how that influences what is done today. I would recommend this book for any person wanting to learn more. It is a very positive book but not influenced by the organization. It is also an easy, quick read to give the big picture in a few hours."
5,NCIS: The Complete Second Season,"This is my favorite show, I enjoy watching all the episodes. Well worth the money. This includes the episode The Meat Puzzle where Gibbs tells Kate that a young Ducky looked like Illya Kuryakin."
3,When will we get Season 1?!?!,"Why does Unbox have every season except the first one, where the premise and the characters are established?!?"
5,NCIS Episode Call to Silence,By far my favorite episode of this great series. Charles Durning does an excellent job of portraying a WWII vet who believes he has killed his best friend.
4,Great service and transaction.,The product was shipped as promised and arrived prior to the deadline. It was in great condition when I received the package.
5,NCIS Second Season,"My daughter has been watching continuously. Now, whenever there is no NCIS marathon on TV, she creates her own"
5,Kissaluvs are AWESOME,"For newborns especially, this is the cloth diaper you want. For all the reasons other reviewers mentioned - cute, VERY functional, hold runny poop like nobody's business ... these are the best. They are a true newborn fit with the size 0, unlike many ""small"" diapers, they actually fit on a 6lb baby, and last up to about 15lbs, depending on the shape of your baby. I am using our size 0s for the 4th time, and they are holding up FANTASTICALLY. They are easy care and excellent quality. I have 24, and find that is enough; the only disposables we use are at night, so I use about 7 kissaluvs a day on the little one. I wash diapers every 3rd day probably."
2,Good Book but code is FILLED with bugs,The book itself is really good but unfortunately alot of the code is buggy as hell. First of all the source code from the early chapters have lots of useless code that you dont need till a few chapters later. You can cut out about 200 lines of code from them. And worst of all is that code from the later chapters wont even compile half the time. Andre could easily fix this by posting updated code on his site but for some reason refuses to. Also Andre seems to insist on using straight C instead of C++ which is kind of aggravating. I would only suggest this book to a complete beginner.
5,"Man, tough crowd. Have you folks READ THIS BOOK?","I've been writing code and designing hardware for 20+ years. In that time I have designed many graphics programs and always had to re-invent the wheel. This book should be titled ""How to Avoid the Pain of Windows Graphical Programming and have fun at the same time"". The other thing is the extensive examples and freeware tools offered with the book. Cheaper than a class."
2,"Passable, but definately not for gurus","I have to agree that this appears to be the dummies book with some added filler. I own both, and now it looks like I will wait for the Volume II he talks about constantly in this one, where he will actually start to address some of the 3D programming and some advanced topics. 3D should have been left out of the title on this one.My advice: If you own his Game Programming for Dummies, don't waste your money, if not, buy this as a starting point.Also: Am I the only one who is tired of 20% or more of most programming books covering Programming 101? Over 200 pages on basic Windows programming in this one. 200 more pages on topic would have been better."
2,"If I had to do it over again, I wouldn't","This book is over 1000 pages of mindless drivel. The author spends a little too much time explaining how the hardware works and not enough time explaining the code. He doesn't even get into directX until chapter 5, over 200 pages into the book.The title is also decieving, ""Fundamentals of 2D and 3D programming."" What they don't tell you is that the book itself is COMPLETELY about 2D programming, and if you want to learn 3D programming, there is a ""bonus"" chapter (only on the CD included) and a list of www links that may or may not help you.I bought Tricks of the Game Programming Gurus and More Tricks of the Game Programming Gurus and was impressed, but with this book I was not."
4,Not bad at all and haven't even read 1/2 of it,"This might sound silly, but I bought this book around the same time I started learning OpenGL with the OpenGL SuperBible. The thing is, the OpenGL SuperBible's examples for the most part relied on GLUT rather than WinMain (and etc). So, I've found this book extremely useful as a reference for many things such as setting up needed Windows calls, multithreading, and sound.I would have given this 5 stars, but I've yet to jump fully into the DirectX world and finish reading this book. However, I can tell you that my other Andre Lamothe's books kick arse!"
1,"Overall, this book could have been a LOT better","Well, i was very deceived when i read this book. It is very basic, and i just don't see where the ""Guru"" part fits in.The advanced topics such as Neural Networks and Genetic algorithms has only 1 page each and the rest is stuff has nothing that your average Joe would not know about game programming.Nothing advanced is covered in this book as the title may suggest and NO D3D.Oh, and half the book cover Win32 programming that has nothing to do with game programming.Sorry Andre, better luck next time. In a word, this book is very deceiving.If i could return it, i would. P.S: Thanks for Amazon for letting us express our honest feelings towards the books we purchase."
4,"A Bit Rushed, but Still a Great Book!","While there are errors, and more errors, it remains extremely valuable. I think he could have skipped the Win32 section, and pushed the reader to Charles Petzold, nonetheless overall very valuable topics (especially the physics modelling, math algorithms, and others). The book is worth its weight in gold, especially since MFC is not used (There is a truckload of overhead from hell). I am patiently waiting for Volume II. One more thing, Andre' thinks he is funny, but he's not."
1,More of a review for the House that Screamed One,"There is a movie called the house that screamed, but I can not find it anywhere. It's simply horrible, the worst movie I have ever seen. So naturally I want to add it to my horrible horror movie collection. If anyone can tell me where to find it, that would be greatly appreciated.The movie appears that it was made by a ten year old who forgot to take there medication, and the resulting film is perfectly awful."
1,Not as good as the MDR-J10,"I bought these headphones today and I am really dissapointed by them. I used to own the MDR-J10's and really enjoyed using them while I exercised. I lost those and replaced them with these, only to find out that they are don't work for me quite as well. The clip is not very stiff and only causes the phones to bounce around much more than the MDR-J10. Also the peice that you put into your ear is bigger than the J10s and doesn't stay in or on my ear at all. Remember everybodies ear is different, so maybe they will work for you but beware."
4,all purpose map with good features,This map is great for reference when we are driving around the city of Cleveland. I also like the fact that it is laminated to resist liquids and general wear. It serves it's purpose well.
1,NOT A GHOST OF A LAFF,"A strange, bizarre and ultimately sad misfire of an alleged pirate comedy starring the sometimes brilliant Peter Sellers and directed by Peter Medak, who two years earlier directed the terrific ""Ruling Class"" Starring Peter O'Toole.Obviously something horrible went wrong here during the writing and production. I'm sure the behind the scenes story of this debacle is much better drama and comedy than the finished product."
5,A Good Book for Geeks Who Love to Laugh,This little bit of whimsy is a lot of fun. It's a fun book to keep on the shelf for those times you're too frustrated to go on coding and you need just a bit of comic relief.
4,What You Need to Begin,"Cal Pozo has a wonderful series out to help people with two-left feet like myself how to dance. The lessons are short and give a variety of dance steps to work with. Do not expect wonders, this is a beginning video. The only way to get good is to put what you learn into practice."
3,Disappointed,"I must be the only person to be disappointed. The knife looks and feels very sturdy--the kind of piece that will last a lifetime. And the blade looks great. My complaint is that the piece you push down to open the blade requires too much pressure to open the knife. The feel just isn't right. I have a Spyder and a Puma knife and those feel really smooth when you open them. Maybe I just got a bad one. Anyway, I'll be returning this."
1,"Two Strikes, You're out!","This is the secondKodak EasyShare V803 8MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Silver Argent)I've bought within the last 12 months. The first was a birthday gift for my 18 yr old daughter. About 2 months later she called to tell me the viewscreen had stopped working. We thought she may have bumped it so I bought a replacement. Less than 2 months later the new camera had the same problem. I contacted Kodak who said it may be a design flaw but I'd have to pay $90 for it to be repaired.After over 30 yrs of owning only Kodak cameras, spending over $200 for 2 practically useless cameras in the same year, and being told I'd have to pay for what may be a design flaw.....I spent the $90 on a new Sony Cyber Shot. I don't plan to buy from Kodak anymore. I also share my experience with friends to save them from making the same costly error."
1,CRACK!!!,"I'm actually searching for a new camera and was curious about what people said about my old camera. Here's what I thought...I bought this camera on the day it came out with no research other than the previous two digital cameras I had were Kodak's and I was comfortable with them. The camera retailed for $199 and was 8MP which I was excited about. I also liked how small it was, that it used my old SD card and had a rechargable battery. Within 2 days the LCD screen cracked right down the center while I was turning it on. The on/off button is top center of the camera and when you press it down it puts pressure on the screen. I had bought it at Target and they exchanged it for another straight up. About 4 months later I had the camera in a cargo pocket and when I reached in to get it I found the screen cracked again. Biggest problem here is that the camera doesn't have a view finder, so when the screen cracks that's it."
1,Camera review,"very unhappy with the service. i bought this camera as a christmas gift. when it was opened and tried out, it was found that the camera did not work, it had vertical lines down the pictures taken. Since I had purchased it as a chrstmas gift, it had been past 15 days since the delivery date, so I am unable to return it. i am very unhappy with this service and i will never purchase anything off amazon again."
3,Great performances in an OK movie,"I thought every performance in this film, from Ed Harris and Marsh Gay Harden to Jeffery Tambor and Jennifer Connolly was excellent. Unfortunately the movie as a whole doesn't live up to their performances. I still really enjoy watching it because of my love of Pollock's work though."
4,Good,"The start of the movie had poor editing, so it was not until 15 minutes later that it turned interesting."
4,Intense Account of Famed Painter,"Ed Harris took over ten years to bring the life story of Jackson Pollock to the screen. You clearly get the feeling that this was a labor of love for Mr. Harris. He portrays Pollock and pours everything he's got into the role. He captures the demons that Pollock faced in a real way without ever going over the top. In addition to playing the lead role, Mr. Harris also directs the film. He shows a deft hand behind the camera and for interesting look at to what he trying to achieve, check out the Charlie Rose interview from the special features section. Mr. Harris eloquently explains his work on the movie. Marcia Gay Harden is excellent as his wife, the artist Lee Krasner. She stands toe to toe with Mr. Harris and she provides the backbone to the film. Her outstanding work earned her the 2000 Best Supporting Actress Award. Amy Harris, Val Kilmer, John Heard and Jennifer Conolley all provide cameo work to this solid effort."
4,As good as its subject...,"with an end just as pointless. Amazing performances by Ed Harris and Marcia Gay Harden - see it for her performance, if nothing else. She is fierce in her role as Lee Krasner.This doesn't feel like watching a movie. It feels like looking in on someone's actual life. You'll ache for a happy ending, and grieve that it never comes. Highly recommended."
2,Reactionary paper,"It's tough to read a paper and trust its business insights when the editorial page is written by such shallow, simple minded, right wing ideologues. There is interesting reporting on new and upcoming businesses, and they suggest an interesting approach to investing, but the value of their advice is severly compromised by the obvious extreme right wing pandering in evidence on the front page news and the editorial section.If you're an average, non-technical investor, I think there are better, mainstream resources, and they are free."
5,Love Leslie Patricelli books,"She has just the right way of seeing it thru your baby's eyes. Love her, love her board books!"
4,"Great Story, but Book Not Well-made","Our daughter is 11 months old and really loves this book! The illustrations are great and it is bright and simple. She will flip through this board book on her own, too. My only gripe with this book is that it doesn't seem well-made at all. We have many books that our daughter looks at over and over again and this is the only one that is already looking quite worn..."
2,Not what I thought!,"I guess I thought this was going to be a book about weaning off the pacifier, it was exactly the opposite! It's about a baby trying to find his lost paci. Not helpful!"
1,worst office product I've ever wasted my money on,"This product is so bad it really doesn't rate the one star I gave it.BIC Wite-Out Correction Tape, 2 TapesI bought multiple boxes of this product because it was at a good price. Not a single one of the dispensers lasted. The takeup reel does not function at all, so you are stuck with having to deal with it hanging from the dispenser. The white out doesn't stick half the time, so you have to keep reeling out more and more.In short...the product sucks period."
2,No mechanism for re-tightening!,"This tape worked fine, but at some point my toddler pulled a few inches of it out, and I could not figure out any way to re-tighten it and get it working again! Unless I'm missing something. I pulled it apart, but then the tape just about jumped off the spool, making it impossible to get working again. Very disappointed!"
3,"Works well, most of the time","I like this product. There are times when it gets a little messed up and the tape doubles over or gets clumpy, but if you can manage to get a nice smooth line the first time it works well."
3,Correction tape death match between BIC and Tombow: Tombow wins,"I use a lot of correction tape to fix errors I make when commenting on my students' papers, so I bought a 10-count pack of BIC's andTombow Classic Mono Correction Tape in Ergonomic Dispenser, 10 Pack (68720).I'd never tried the Tombow brand, but I didn't think there would be much difference... Wrong! The Tombow correction tape is much better than the BIC. The BIC tape does not adhere as smoothly, as you can see in the photo I posted. Also, the Tombow has a rewinding knob, and as many reviewers have noted, the BIC does not. So if the BIC tape gets unwound, as it sometimes does in my book bag, I can't fix it.Either brand will get the job done, but when I use up these 20 cartridges, I'll be buying Tombow."
2,CHEAP,"1) Hard to roll2) It feels cheap3) Gets JammedCorrection tape is supposed to be EASY to roll. This product is not easy to use at all. I have to press with the weight of ten men to get it moving. Even when you can somehow get it to rotate, the tape refuses to stay on the paper surface. I have to press down to adhere the white out tape to the paper myself.What is the point of have correction tape if you have to do all the work yourself? I think I'll try another brand or just use liquid...P.S. In the end I had to throw it away. A total waste of money!"
1,Don't bother buying these!,"I bought several packages of these because I am a teacher and use a lot of white out tape. I have always used another brand, but these were less expensive and I figured they would be equal quality as the other brand considering they were made by a well-known company (Bic). I have been VERY disappointed with them. The tape never stays tight and I am always having to waste white out tape to ""wind"" the loose tape. Also, the tape turns easily so that the plastic side it facing out instead of the white-out side. I took one apart the other day to try to fix the turned tape and that was a disaster! I ended up just throwing the whole thing out because I was so frustrated trying to get it back together right. I had a student yesterday that had one exactly like mine and he was pulling it apart and trying to fix it too. I guess I'm not the only one with problems with them!"
4,Very moving book,"I liked the author's use of her own personal experiences in this book. I felt like not only was she helping other parents to understand and work with the professionals who deal with her child, but she was also giving some of herself in the process."
3,Good,"This textboook is alright, it came in the form quality I would have expected, rough around the edges still a very usable book"
5,Perfect Match,"I was looking for something EXTRA special for my daughter's teacher as she has a very different teaching style that I found amazing. She would talk to my daughter over the phone for 20 mins in the evening to help her understand something they were working on in class that I couldn't explain. She brings the facts of life into her classroom as well as teaching individuality and moral strength. She loves and cares about her students, each one. This poem was perfect for her!"
2,wont buy again,"I bought these to replace old wiper blades on my Sportstrac. They installed easily. About two weeks after they installed the end of one of the blades popped away from the windshield causing it to miss about a 6"" path. I was able to lift the blade and drop it back onto the windshield which caused it to form to the windshield again. A few days later it happened again while I was driving. I've also driven with these blades in subfreezing temperatures and they easily build up with ice causing them to be completely ineffective. During one 300+ mile trip I had to stop three times to break off the buildup of ice. I've never had any of these issues with other wiper blades. I wont buy them again."
3,"Not like the picture, but good.","Hit of the party with this costume - as a female! I did reinforce with cardboard, since it is flimsy, and had to iron the lampshade, but it is very comfortable and lightweight!"
2,Cheesy chinese styrofoam,"Fhe costume was obviously designed here then sent to China for printing & pressing. A great idea for Halloween, but lame still, ultimately. The fact that it folds in and has to be corrected constantly is a major problem, but we're talking about a costume of limited prepararation here. What am i bitching about? I saw so many creative & better ones that I actually became jealous.....Not for them but for my lame choice..Hell, I had to wait until the next day to get laid. It was worth it, though."
3,What TV used to be like,"Betty White produced and starred in this middling, stagy comedy show based on the concept of newlyweds getting used to each other. Daily routines are given a ""chuckle"" treatment by the writer, Betty White herself! Yes, in true TV pioneer fashion, she wrote and starred in her own series. No guffaws here, just typical 50s sweetness.The 8 episodes are untitled, just numbered. Here is brief synopsis of each:1) Elizabeth drives husband to distraction4) Alvin the shutterbug5) Elizabeth plots to get Alvin to buy a car6) Elizabeth tries being her own carpenter7) Alvin tries to cheer up Elizabeth10) Elizabeth's car is stolen15) Elizabeth and Alvin compete in board games15a) Elizabeth and bill problemsSome of us consider Betty White to be a national treasure. Here is a chance to see her as she first appeared on TV."
4,nice and easy,"i like this because it is slow and easy, the music is relaxing and the models are very pretty too!"
4,Great Discovery,I heard the song Heavenly on a local radio stations quiet storm period and it was awesome and most of the rest of the CD is also very good and the conversion quality is excellent. The service was also very good
1,You're being taken,"This is great music but you can get this album domestically as part of ""Mwandishi: The Complete Warner Bros. Recordings"" for literally pocket change more. It's worth it to check out the other two albums included in the set."
1,Worst Madden to date!,"This Madden is a pathetic example of the 360! They should do Microsoft a favor and recall the game and start over. The graphics are something from the Super Nintendo! I might not sound fair but this is supposed to be next gen material and they took 15yrs back in time. I can't talk down about this game enough I rather play madden 95 on the sega anyday of the week then have to sit through the title of the this so called next gen game! Sorry if I sound sour, but it was my money spent so I feel like I can say what I think."
3,Kiefer Sutherland's directorial debut,"Kiefer Sutherland directs this edgy crime caper about a group of criminals, Vincet Gallo (Buffalo 66, The Funeral), Kim Dickens (Great Expectations 98', Mercury Rising), Kiefer Sutherland (Taking Lives, Phone Booth) and Mykelti Williamson (Heat, Con Air) who end up at the wrong end of a bad situation and they hit the rode in which case they kidnap a couple, Kevin Pollack and Grace Phillips, hold them hostage for the duration. All the while corrupt FBI agents, led by Martin Sheen (Tv's The West Wing, The War At Home) are hot on their trail and the funny thing is that the gang dont know is that Williamson is a undercover cop. Sutherland does a good job with the action pieces and the cast does a good work with the acting but It treads on offially familiar territory. Max Perlich (Drugstore Cowboy, Blow), Rod Steiger (Modern Vampires, Mars Attacks) and John C. McGinley (Tv's Scrubs, Wall Street) also star."
2,DULL AND GRATING ON THE NERVES,"Vincent Gallo is strange. The characters here are all strange. Kevin Pollack is interesting and surprising and you will feel genuine sympathy for his wife. Kiefer Sutherland is not interesting or surprising, and you will get tired of him quickly, just like everyone else in the film. Predictable film and all too long for me."
4,Guide Flies: How to tie and fish the killer flies from Americas Greatest Guides and Fly Shops,This book is a giant hardback which has many fly patterns for trout and some for bass and many other species. The recipes are thorough and if one is a seasoned fly tier than they will have a treaury of flies to tie.
5,"humorous and helpful, a must for parents in NYC",I found the book to be very helpful to me in negotiating my first child into school and with a host of other everyday concerns - issues I knew somebody had the answers to but I certainly did not. All written in a very friendly funny way.
2,Very Powdery. Not much flavor,"The product is not as fragrant as I expected. The color of the lemon peel powder is very pale. Not much of the taste and smell. I rather go to Penzey Spice and pay more for the quality. Also with Barry Farm, the shipping of the product took so long. You pay for the price of the product. Also, shipping is too expensive for the small amount."
2,"Appropriate for its time, which is has come and gone","The heart of the matter is that this *was* a fantastic book for its time. Unfortunately, that time was 2006. There are references to things like the new Gmail service, Firefox 2, IE7, and Windows Vista. The concepts behind many of these things are sound, but to be useful you have to rejigger it to today's technology. Because, let's face it, most of the hacks here are technology based implementations forGetting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity. There was a second version of this book, calledUpgrade Your Life: The Lifehacker Guide to Working Smarter, Faster, Better, which updates the technology to 2008 standards and adds some more content. But, frankly, it is easier just to go over to the Lifehacker web site (and subscribe to their RSS feed) and find out newer, easier ways to do the things listed in the book."
2,"Make sure you're the ""intended audience"" for this book","I could see where this book would be an excellent read for a ""hyper-techie"". Although I consider myself well above par on computer technology, this book had no appeal to me because I'm not - at all - for making changes to the registry (although I know how) or for tampering ""under the hood"" of any other part of the operating system, never ever really a wise move in the end (when the computer house comes crumbling down). ""Working under the hood"" is what this book is about, NOT maximizing (or turbo charging) one's managerial or operational efficiency, which is what I thought the book was about. Make sure it's a fit before you buy it. I returned it."
4,"Lots of great tips, not a lot of jargon","I purchased Lifehacker after being an avid reader of the website for a couple of years. There had been some things showcased on the site, that I either couldn't find in the archives or was too busy (lazy) to research further. When author Gina Trapani released the book, I got it almost immediately. In it were the items that I had been looking for, as well as some new tips that I implemented, or intend to as soon as I can. There wasn't a lot of insider technical mumbo-jumbo. It's a well written, almost step-by-step account of how to make things a little easier for those who use computers, with out making it too difficult."
4,it's really cute and works well.,"I bought this for my new Ipod. It's been working well so far. and It's really light and cute, so it's easy to carry and use. I like this!!"
4,Good to have if you want to charge w/o your pc,"When I travel I always take my I-Pod but I don't always want to take my pc. This charger is great for those times - but be aware you will also need to purchase a firewire cable to connect your I-Pod to the charger (the cable that comes with the IPod to hook to your pc does not work with this charger). Charger and cable are small and easy to carry. Just plug it into any outlet and it will charge your I-Pod. When first gen I-Pods came out, these chargers came FREE with them but I guess they figured they could make more $$$ selling them as a stand alone item."
4,"Good read, but challenging at times","I stumbled across this book by word of mouth. Throughout the entire book I felt that Dr. Badiou had good arguments, & I would recommend his Ethics book to any aspiring ethicist."
4,Psycho Good,This was a great book as the other one that I have read from this author Pam Johnson-Bennett. Her stories were very helpful and I enjoy reading the various stories that were in this book. I would highly reccommend this to other readers and cat owners new and old. I actually shared this book with co-workers who said the same thing.
3,Get the facts straight!,"This good vacation read, ie no-brainer, suffers from the rediculous way the story unfolds. It also suffers because anyone who knows anything about the market has to wonder why this author doesn't. He is allegedly in the business - yet his main character signs up at a Daytrade firm and makes one trade in two weeks. His understanding of terms like lock-up period is also less than anyone who has passed a Series 7 (brokers test)Serious flaws and stupid characters detract, although the action is fast paced in ths almost funny story."
3,Ehhhh,"&#65279;The best part about this book happens in the last few pages. I guess that is how a book should be,but the text leading up to the ending should be better than this novel was. I have enjoyed most ofStephen Frey's books, but this one was a let down. I was ready to give this a 2 star rating, untilthe last few pages. It should not have been a surprise to me, but it was, probably because I lost alot of interest in the book and was not paying close enough attention. It Frey's previous booksthe financial part was an important part of the story, but in this one the main character could haveworked as a janitor at a high school and the story could have basically been the same."
3,Something like The Takeover,"I really liked this book when I read it. So, I turned around and read another one of Mr. Frey's books, The Takeover, some two weeks later. Reading The Takeover, I am sensing that Stephen Frey had run out of material for The Day Trader and just went back to the original formula, for in some (perhaps relatively minor) instances, this novel plays out like his first. I would have given The Day Trader 4 stars had I not gotten a hold of its prototype. Still, it's a terrific way to pass the time while riding the the NYC subway."
5,New find,"Hallelujah! I have found another writer I enjoy as much as Braun, Rita Mae Brown, Clive Cussler and Tom Clancy. Please hurry with the next novel."
1,why this Anthology didn't work,"Moniza Alvi, as we know from Pakistan but brouhgt up in England in A Bowl of Warm Air has focused only upon herself and her struggle to find her true identity in each and every one of these poems. They are written in very confusing verses and do not let the reader come up with any conclusuins. When used in school contexts it is very hard to connotate. On the whole this anthology is ""not"" one of the best"
3,crossing the wire-book review,"Crossing the WireWill HobbsVictor Flores is a fifteen-year-old boy living in a small village in Mexico. He works hard to provide money for his three younger siblings and mother. But when falling crop priced threaten his family with starvation, Victor heads north in an attempt to ""cross the wire"" from Mexico to the united States in order to find work and send money home to his family. With no money to pay the smugglers who sneak illegal workers across the border, Victor must make the journey alone.Victor must struggle to survive as jumps trains, hides from the border patrol, and walks for miles through the hot, dry dessert. His journey is filled with narrow escapes, danger, freezing cold and broiling heat, hunger and hopeless situations. Through this book Will Hobbs tells the story of countless immigrants' struggles to cross the border.-- Isabel Aurichio"
4,Nice pleasant easy to listen to bluegrass,"My dad LOVES traditional bluegrass and i enjoy the ""Progressive Bluegrass"" but we both enjoy this Music.Sometimes I have it in my car and just listen to it over and over."
1,Really frustrating failure,"Where the cartridges screws into the container, there is a tiny metal piece which punctures the cartridge and releases the gas, just like every dispenser. Around that metal is a annular piece of rubber, which I guess keeps the cartridge properly balanced so that the metal punctures the cartridge properly. Well, after only a couple of uses that piece of rubber ruptured, causing the disperser to mis-fire every single time I refill it, puncturing the cartridge without capturing any of the gas into the container, causing it to just start flowing out everywhere. Huge disappointment that the product can completely and utterly fail with such a small failure, now I'm stuck with a complete useless dispenser. Definitely need to try another brand that isn't this fragile..."
3,"for the version, not the movie","THis is the Roger Corman version done for American audiences, not the restored version that had 99 minutes of the original 101 version.Skip this. Buy the collection's edition. That set has the original long version and the short Corman version. I am off to buy it. Held off expecting this to be the longer version. Guess not.Do not judge this movie by this version which is mostly reconstructed of out takes. Interesting to see the two movies side by side, but this version is inferior.Still debating if I shall see Cage's version or not. Doubt it."
4,Much Better--Less Cagey,"I wasted an afternoon when the newer version came out. Nicholas Cage was not enough to salvage it. When I read that Christopher Lee said that the original Wicker Man was his favorite of all the movies that he had made, I rented it. The original version is sinister where the sequel is pityingly laughable. The songs, which were a bit distracting the first time, became assets on subsequent viewings. (like the piano piece from The Bad Seed)"
4,Please put this out on DVD,"This movie is so good that it's a crime that it's no longer easily available. Anchor Bay, are you listening?"
2,strange,"The Wickerman, is not a typical horror movie. I don't know what genre I would even put it in. It's weird. A police man from the mainland (in scotland) is in search of a missing girl. He travels out to this island, where all the people who live there have a ""different' way of living. He gets the run around from every towns person on the island, when he asks the whereabouts of the girl. The island's people perform ritials, and parade around with animal costumes on, and have strange beliefs, it's like they are hippy types..It seems the missing girl may be dead? Or is she just bait, for ""The Wickerman?"
4,The Wicker Man (Two-Disc Special Edition),"It was a decent movie, the remake was of course better in the updated filming, but besides that they were both equally interesting."
5,An easy to understand beginners guide,"I highly recommend this book not only for people that are wanting to learn networks, but also for networking professionals that need a handy reference guide. The book is an easy to understand basic introduction to networking with Nortel products. Kudos to the authors."
5,Wonderful series; very satisfying,"I was happily surprised by this series. The short synopsis given makes it sound very depressing. It was not. Acting was brilliant, low key and believable. This was a very uplifting series. When it ended, I just wanted to see the whole thing over again. That rarely happens to me. Money very well spent."
4,A good read for discouraged management accountants.,"For those management accountants who feel less than totally appreciated (the real ones will know this to be a common feeling) then this book shows how financial accounting usurped management accounting when the bean counters went looking for shareholders and needed to tell less than the truth about what was going on inside their firms.If auditors are just hookers with a degree, then financial accountants are then just politicians without a cause - you cannot run a business on late and averaged data from the financial perspective.This book reminds us that knowing what things cost to make and cost to sell is what keeps a firm on the black ink side of the ledger.Worth a read."
3,It's like watching an accident happen....,"I'm actually kind of mixed on this DVD. This look into the lives of 2 reclusive women was interesting to me. But a friend with whom I viewed the film was appalled that we watched these people have the same fights over and over again. As a fan of biographies, though, I find other people's paths and choices fascinating. And I think I have more understanding of the choices women make in their lives. **By the way, I just read in the Boston Globe on Sunday that Little Edie has died. One less ""staunch character"" in the world. Alas."
2,Exploitive,"Two ultimately uninteresting women are the basis of this documentary, an exploitive film, which I'm sure was only made because of that ""slim"" Kennedy connection. Puh-lease!The two women are dull and their lives aren't explored enough to justify the film. It's just constant bickering and Edie showing off to the camera (and her totally dull philosophy). The filmmakers seem more obsessed with showing us two eccentric women and the hole they live in than anything else. Considering the filmmakers involved (the Maysles namely), the film is a huge disappointment."
1,expensive dose of humor at the expense of an american treasure,"Felt as if I was peeping through the Beale's key hole. Price for rental was more valuable than the insight, ahem, or should I say the lack thereof, into the Beale psyche. If you're a celebrity-gone-broke voyeur, you'll love this show."
4,Grey Gardens,"Meet Big and Little Edith Beale. Former grand dames of the Hamptons who have lived most of their lives in their once stately home named Grey Gardens. At the time of filming, Grey Gardens is falling apart, board by board, and the Edies are living in squalor amid a bunch of cats, fleas, flies, and weeds. They spend their days eating crackers and ice cream. They don't seem to care much about their surroundings, but you can tell that they do care about each other - a sort of dysfunctional dependency if you will. While highly eccentric, I found the Edies to also be very intelligent and very maddening."
4,Ms. Havisham move over Edie has arrived!,"Anyone interested in the Kennedy's, Jackie, New York society or the Hamptons will find this film haunting and disturbing yet enjoyable. The film leaves the viewer wanting to know more about both Big and Little Edie's past and future. A certain sense of exploitative voyuerism surrounds all aspects of this film so don't expect airbrushed reality - Grey Garden's covers the social history of a family to the cats that have infested their run down home in the posh seaside town of Easthapton. If nothing else it's a wonderful topic of discussion at cocktail parties. The commentary and extra audio interview are especially good."
2,"sad, pointless","Why did they make this film? What was the point? If there had not been a Bouvier connection to Jacqueline, there would have been no film and we all would have been better off.It's depressing and sad to see two women, both of whom were quite beautiful in their youth, descend to such insanity. I've heard better conversations when I worked in a mental hospital.If you have a morbid fascination for decay, then this is your film.Others -- don't waste your time. I sat through half and finally came to my senses and turned it off."
5,Another great Maysles film,"I saw this film at the old Post Office Cinema in East Hampton when it came out in limited release in 1976. Filming was done in 1974 at the mansion on West End Road, now owned by Ben Bradley of the Washington Post.The film is great like the rest of the Maysles films. I will pass along this little story. I was working as a desk officer at the old East Hampton Village police station on Newtown Lane about 30 years ago when little Edie called me one winter afternoon.She reported an alien in a ufo flying around the yard of her house. So I sent a cop up to her mansion and it turned out it was a tree cutter in a cherry picker trimming trees of a neighbor. Another note: The lead detective in the 1972 raid of the Beale's house, is now the mayor of that charming village!"
2,i wanted to know more,a disappointing book overall. i wanted more information about mr. wakeman's introduction to a multi-keyboard approach to playing and composing. where did he get his first moog or mellotron? how did he find out about them? did he do any research on synthesis resulting in the fascinating patches he created? i wasn't interested in the super-musician hits bottom turns to god story. if you are you will enjoy the reading. in this book and in other interviews that i have read with rick wakeman he seems to view yes as a footnote in his career...i think it is just the opposite.
5,tape,Great price. Cheaper than my Walmart. Received quickly and it was packaged nicely. Purchased for an art project at school.
4,It blew me away,The author warnes that the book is not for beginner programmers or even pros who do not have ASP.Net experience. Unfortunately for me it was true - he is operating with subjects and concepts well beyond my level. Also the book is in [...] and I do my tinkering in [...]. But I open the book time to time to read some passages that always leave me in awe of this kind of expertise.
4,Good ASP.NET book but not for beginners,"The title of this book should be *Advanced* ASP.NET Problem - Design - Solution. This is not a book for those new to ASP.NET (at the ASP.NET page http://www.asp.net there is a section that includes ASP.NET books divided by beginner and professional; very useful). This book is for the developer who has programmed at least 6 or so websites with ASP.NET and wants to get into creating forums, mailings list, profiling, allowing the user to choose their own themes/skins, etc. The author assumes you have a firm handle on ASP.NET (also on HTML, CSS, Object oriented programming, C#, SQL and SQL stored procedures, n-tier design of web apps, etc) and quickly moves into advanced programming with ASP.NET. I would rate this book highly because it does cover a lot; it's just not practical for beginners or even intermediate level ASP.NET developers."
3,Whoops! Reader Beware.,"I just ordered this book based on the enthusiastic reviews. Indications were that it was the best book available for what I needed--a text to help me make the transition from original ASP to ASP.NET. Whoops. The reader should be aware that the author presumes the reader already knows ASP.NET. This is clearly a book not just for the intermediate programmer, but for the intermediate ASP.NET programmer. That said, if you already know ASP.NET, this seems to be a good book to help you apply that knowledge to building complete website applications. But you'll need to learn ASP.NET somewhere else."
4,Excellent Book,Nice book for website design and development. Author has done an excellent job explaining how to use DAL and BLL. I would recommend this book to anyone doing the web development.
5,Great examples in this book for real world applications,"The web site that this book creates by the end is a great example of a content management system. I don't get to program often, so seeing an implemented version of a 3-tier web site is valuable. The example in this book goes a long way to show (not just tell) why 3-tier design can be so beneficial. Lots of other great examples too that you would have a tough time finding in on-line forums, such as caching and paging directly from the database. I liked the extra touch of the last chapter, which provides the minute details for publishing your site to web server. All the examples are in c# only, which is the language that I prefer anyway."
5,An Excellent book that combines sprituality and science!,"And still makes sense!I have read a few of Deepak's books, and finally have come out with a belief that he is talking out of his league in some of his later books (on happiness and realization etc). But this book is a classic.Deepak Chopra was a trained MD/Doctor in the east coast before taking on Ayurveda and spirituality as full time job! This is one book where he combines his medical knowledge and spiritual knowledge in right doses and makes a good sense out of that.He manages to capture the Indian spirituality (behind all the rituals and religions of India), and makes it easy to understand. Placing spiritual knowledge on a scientific foundation/facts in this book is what is appealing to me.In all a great read and a few points to take away (for changing your lifestyle for the better)."
5,Ageless Body. Timelss Mind,Excellent information as a basis for expanding holistic health and wellness. would recommend to anyone embarking on this personal journey
3,Good product,"i love this comforter,the quality is great and it feels nice.was heavier than i expected but that really isnt an issue.i have decided to edit the review and lower it by 2 stars.after washing the colors ran so it now looks like a tie die comforter."
5,Tommy Hilfiger American Classic Comforter - 5 Stars,"Bought this comforter for my son. He's loves how fluffy and warm it is. Excellent quality. Beautiful rich color. Price was very good also. More expensive in the high-end stores. Would recommend this to anyone.Tommy Hilfiger American Classics Twin Comforter, Donegal Red"
1,American Flyer Price Guide - Useless,Only part numbers are shown. So if you do not the part number you cannot get a price. I had hoped that there would be photos of equipment also. Should have returned it. I was trying to sell my American Flyer train stuff.
3,my doggie thinks it's tasty!,"i bought this in pink, white, and black because i thought it was so cute. my dog, however, thought it was more tasty than cute. she proceeded to try to eat it while rolling around on her back to get leverage on the sweater. they are real feathers!"
2,wrong gun,thats a kimber 1911 in the pick... no where near the same gun so those are not the grips ur getting
5,"My Wife if not into 'Sexy""",My wife is really not into to 'sexy' clothing or lingerie. I can't usually get her to wear thongs either but I did get her to wear this and it completely transformed her into the sexy sensual goddess I know she is and usually keeps suppressed inside. It looked great on her and she seemed to enjoy sex more with it on. Thumbs up for this outfit and it is comfortable to her and my skin rubbing against her. Only downside is it somewhat delicate and won't take much to tear it but for this price and a great night of love making it can easily be replaced at this price. I also got the black one for her and have not tried it yet. Will post review on it hopefully 'real' soon!
4,Harmony,"Is a reprint of two previous novels, ""After Dark"" and ""Bridal Jitters.""Both were cute. I liked After Dark with Lydia and Emmett although I was disappointed that it followed basically the same premiss as some of ther other Harmony novels in that the two characters end up living together in a small apartment."
4,Not a reprint of Amaryllis or Zinnia,"While this book is a reprint of two former excellent works by Jayne Ann Krentz (writing as Jayne Castle) it is NOT Amaryllis or Zinnia. Those two books are set on the fictional planet of St. Helens in the city-state of New Seattle and are part of a trilogy ending with Orchid.After Dark, the first in the Harmony duo, is the first story in a new series about para-archaeologist Lydia Smith and her mate Emmett London. The second in this series is the newly printed After Glow another excellent futuristic by Castle.These stories are set on another planet named Harmony.I recommend these stories highly... if nothing else, read the stories to meet Fuzz :o)Bridal Jitters is from the former Charmed Anthology... it is also based on Harmony Planet, but is not part of the Lydia Smith series."
4,McCarthy's first novel is...,"I love Cormac McCarthy and perhaps have read his books in reverse order. That is by starting with his later novels, The Road, No Country, All The Pretty Horses, Blood Meridian, it seems that I have missed out on the great vision that all his books create. The Orchard Keeper, his first, is not his best, still it is brilliant and perhaps more so when viewed as sort of an appendix to later novels. The narrative is a balance between his own emerging voice and that of Faulkner. Clearly. But by the time we get to Blood Meridian, however, we find that some of the characters and motifs established in this early book are key to understanding the bigger universe which is distinctly McCarthy's own voice.I love reading first novels of great authors. Usually they are raw and unbridled. The Orchard Keeper is...great. I recommend this one. Start here if you plan on reading his other more popular books."
4,Language is the Main Character,"The Orchard Keeper, Cormac McCarthy's first novel, is more than just a taste of what will come later in his writing career (although there is certainly that element in the novel). Mainly, the novel features his extremely distinctive prose. His weird, twisted diction, mixed with Kentucky dialect and strange extinct words brought back to life on the page.The plot of The Orchard Keeper is hard to follow. Characters are sometimes not named, and the reader must decipher who is speaking and where and when the action is occurring. There are several events happening nearly together, and they are tied at the end in a not completely satisfactory way.The real showcase of this novel is the use of language. McCarthy shows here that he is not afraid to use language to fit the needs of his art, sometimes nearly twisting it to be breaking point."
3,Not for the causal reader,"I agree with other reviewers who said this book shows signs of the brilliance that was still forming. On its own, it's not a great read. The narration is kind of a mess and it's pretty obvious he's trying to out-Faulkner Faulkner. Still, it's fascinating to me that this was his first novel. Wow. For a first novel, despite its many shortcomings, it's an impressive feat. The language alone blew my socks off."
2,disjointed and self indulgent,"Having first read ""The Road"" McCarthy's brilliant apocalyptic tale I was expecting much more from this, his first novel. While the characters are developed nicely there is no story for the reader to grasp, just an occasional glimmer of continuity. What we expect never materializes and the reader is left wondering what they've just spent time trying to digest. McCarthy tends to ramble on about nothing in what appears, at times, to be a Miriam-Webster exercise in obscure and abstract terms. At times it seems as if Mr. McCarthy is peering down his nose at us and saying I'm just too smart for my own good and you, my layperson friends, just don't ""get"" me."
3,I was expecting greater performance.,"I purchased these pads per the advice of my mechanic and was told to expect improved performance over the OEM pads. Unfortunately, this was not the case. I have an Infiniti G35 and these pads have me driving with extreme caution. While the rear pads appear to meet, if not exceed, the same standard as the OEM pads, the front pads just do not have the same stopping power as the OEM pads. Exercise caution before purchasing! I will not be repurchasing the front brake pads again."
5,FANTASTIC THRILLER!,"Once you begin this book you won't be able to put it down! Not only was it fun to read, but it was very educational too. The novel is packed with interesting facts about North Korea. The thrilling ending leaves you wanting more from this talented writer."
3,The Wilderness,"I had read Karen's two previous novels with the same characters. This thrd one was just a pinch more off base then the others and when I finished it I wondered why I read it at all. Karen Novak has a great command of the English language. I love reading her words. She really does a fantastic job describing a room, a person or a scenario. She is very gifted in that regard. I just didn't like this story."
1,Dissappointing,"What a shame - could have been a great story. Really a bit more about Mr. Batten and Landmark Communications than the title suggests. While there is nothing wrong with that, more about the people who grew the business and how they actually did it would have been interesting. Many of the people who made great sacrifices and fought to build the business and brand are not even mentioned. Who did the marketing research? Who made the programming changes? Who created the brand image campaigns and advertising? Who wrote the strategic, marketing and programming plans that led to the growth in ratings and revenues. Who showed that reducing the frequency of local forecasts would actually result in ratings increases? Why are ratings off and what is being done about that? What a shame."
4,Not enough stuff about the weather people.,I bought the book and enjoyed it but I was so disappointed that the authors didn't show us more pictures and tell us more about the history of the on-camera weather people and also the great music TWC played in the 80's and 90's.
4,Sort of scary!,Actually it works fine and keeps the bugs at bay. The only downside it MUST be absolutely windless. The fog hugs the ground only when there is no wind.
4,About as perfect as you can get,"We have a 30x60' wooden privacy fenced-in backyard. We fog each evening we spend time back there(Which is 4-7 days a week).We learned to fog 2x about 30 minutes apart. It simply seems to be a lot more effective. No matter what, I still find out the next day that a few elusive ankle biters still get me. A tiny squirt of spray on each ankle cures that.As a bonus it seems to take care of bugs in general. Our front post light is swarming with bugs nightly while our brighter hanging gazebo light in back seems to attract very few, if any bugs. Without another explanation, I'd have to give credit to the fogger for that.The propane tank and fog juice seems to be very generous in the amount of use you get out of them as well.Last summer we couldn't even play yard games without quitting at mercy of the mosquitoes. Compared to what I've been used to in Wisconsin for 38 years, this has been a blessing and the only thing I've found effective to date aside from deet."
4,It kills them.... It kills them all!!!,"This product works great and is easy to use. I have had it for about 1 1/2 months with no problems. Part of having no problems is doing your research and finding out how to clean it and doing preventative maintenance. The 40 ounce tank will go a long ways in fogging. Also, the fuel cost about 3-4 bucks a tank. It says the fuel tank will last about 2-3 hrs. I really like using the fogger."
1,terrible!,I bought this in june and its n ot august. Item stopped working and I can return it. 3x use and nothing
4,very pleased w item,Fogger works great and keeps mosquitoes at bay though there is a lot of fog and it makes others nearby nervous ...lol ! it matters not if they are not getting bit by mosquitoes thank you for a wonderful product
3,"Very basic, nothing inspiring.","If you are looking for a basic introduction to the priciple's involved with UI design they are all here. If you are looking to be inspired or taken to another level, don't look here."
2,"A good magazine article, stretched way too far","There is a good story here, but it is padded with ancillary information, and the story has so much filler that it became a chore to finish. This should have been a good magazine article, not a book."
2,It could have been better,"I cannot fault the locale, sets, costumes and most of the cast, but the background music is abominable. It sounds like something from a trite 60s action series. I keep expecting Peter Gunn or one of his ilk to appear. Just when you are finally able to get involved in the story line along comes background music so jarring that it totally destroys the mood the actors and director worked so hard to evoke. You are suddently, and all too abruptly aware that they are merely playing at recreating one of the most dramatic periods of the last century."
2,"Good start, but flags halfway through","Nice idea, highlighting the work of undercover women in WW II. The series starts out with string characters and decent writing. But it loses its way about halfway through. Characters keep doing inexplicable things. The dialog becomes trite, and the acting follows it. Really...a priest ranting at God on a hillside? Anyway, a good idea poorly executed, all in all."
1,production (value) frozen in time,"the movie has a so-la-la script, not thrilling or exciting, but transports somehow the story. acting is doable. the director's work is just awful - stiff, wooden, two dimensional and so is the entire production. most of it filmed in a studio, or probably on a stage. it looks like a tele(stage)play from the early sixties. i was surprised that such low production value still exists."
2,Mine leaks too,"Purchased this with a new outboard. Seemed like a nice tank. The dealer cautioned me that I should leave the vent open a tad to prevent ""blowing out the seal"" from pressure buildup. But he also cautioned me to not leave the vent open lest cooling of the tank suck in moist air in the evening, thus contaminating my fuel with water. Not sure about you, but I can't be adjusting the vent on my fuel tank twice a day. So, I just left it closed, hoping for the best. The next day, I found the tank leaking from the outflow fitting (as described in other reviews here). Not sure if this is a bad design or a bad unit. Dealer has given me a replacement which I haven't tested yet."
5,My Scene Party Pad by Mattel,This is a great item for play and dioramas for your dolls that are 11 1/2 in. The staircase is what I really wanted but I ended up using my own kind of background wall paper to cover the original and it looks like my dolls are in their own apt/loft. The price was great and the shipping was superfast within a few days. I highly recommend this product for those who like to play! And I'm an adult by the way and not a kid but my 9 yr old niece is loving this Party Pad too!
5,Ups & downs of the loft,"I don't have this toy(yet!!!)and I want it so badley even thought by some reviews this toy doesn't seem very durable.But hey,I've put together stuff that says""Adults Asemble""even thought I'm only nine.I've even managed to tame Kenzie's kiosk.Ok,back to the cart.I gave this toy 2 stars for education because what does it teach you,really?How to decorate your room?"
3,Boring,"I was very disapointed with this book. The cover looked and sounded so entertaining, but I found it dull. Their wasn't much plot, and the three women were so worldly and superficial, even though they claimed to be born again Christians. I got so tired of all the references to money and power. I think the idea of three young ladies who have their own ""therapy sessions"" at the spa every couple mo. is a cute idea for a book, but the author just didn't write enough action scenes. I quit the book halfway through. I may finish it one of these days since it wasn't horrible, but right now I'd rather spend my time reading quality fiction. There is quality Christian fiction out there-check out my other reviews and lists."
2,Shallow read,"This author is writing way below her abilities. You can tell that she is a very witty and clever writer but her content leaves SO much to be desired. The main female character's main obsession is her HAIR, believing that it is the cause of all of her problems."
5,A Guide to Understanding and Practice of Spiritual Healing,"Despite ordered from overseas,it's arrived within a week and a very good condition (Signed). I am completely satisfied and certainly coming back again.Thank you very much."
1,The thermostat doesn't work,"I just started using this heater and it does a great job keeping the water warm -- too warm. It keeps the water at 65 - 75 degrees when the outside temperature is in the low 30s. I'm sure the birds love this, but I don't want to pay to heat the whole outdoors. I'm going to have to return this but I don't know if Ishould reorder the same item, expecting that the new one would have a working thermostat (temperature control)."
5,Birdbath heater,"I can honestly say I am very pleased with this heater. I put my birdbath on the ground for the winter, the squirrels, rabbits, and birds are very happy. Not too much evaporation with this unit so it stays full longer. I would highly recommend this heater to my friends."
2,It was not what I expected,I figured 150 watts would heat water better and have a lower setting than it does. I guess De-icer does not mean heater...
5,Great heater,"I have owned the birdbath heater before, I like it because they seem to last quite a few years. It's heavy enough to stay in the bath, even when the squirrels play with it."
2,Great for 1 year each,"I have been through two of these, each lasts for about as long as it stays plugged in.Once the season ends and you put it away, it doesn't like to work the next year.I've cleaned them up, sealed them and nothing seems to help.Now I use a deeper bucket and just a regular old mini H2O pump to keep the water moving.Yes, I tried both the cheaper model and the more expensive model.Electricity and water, they just don't mix.David"
4,"Excellent, but 3-minute gap in last song","I bought the digital version of this CD for my Dad. He's an avid Stan Kenton fan. I loved the arrangements of all these songs; a definite must-have for any jazz, brass, or Christmas-music fan. The perfect trifecta if you're all three.The only thing I found unsual is the last track (Motown Jingle Bells). The length of this track says 8:39. As I listened to it, the basic song ends after 5 minutes. Then, there's 3 minutes of dead air. The remaining 30 seconds can best be described as the band goofing around, with their own mini rendition of ""The Holly and the Ivy"". Not sure if that was a mistake in the recording, or if it was intentional. I have made my own edited version of the track, ending it after 5:05 minutes."
1,Don't buy it,"I purchased this car speaker and they suck!. Once you try increasing the valume, the speakers start making this weird sound and it is extremely annoying. Don't buy. Buy something that has at least some quality and don't waste your money buying this cheap waste of time product."
3,you get what you pay for,not a very good speaker but for the price what do you expect i think the blowed speaker i replaced could keep up with these they dont sound bad until you turn the radio up to higher sound levels then you know you got what you paid for
4,not for bass,Speakers sound nice. just not for bass. if you have a pair of subs to go with them their awesome
2,Maybe an upgrade from paper stock,I just installed one of these in my car I will not be installing the other. I am not sure they are better than stock. I am am not happy at all.
2,Poor Quality,Bought these to replace a factory speaker that blew out. These have very poor sound quality and no bass. Pay more for something worth having.
4,handy,decently small reader and i like that you can put the cap on either end to protect the usb plug or the sd card
1,Waste of money,"I bought these dvds two weeks ago, the cover looks shine, seem very attractive, elegant and professional, but they are just models for the marketing,they are not the teachers (the dvd's content is totally the opposed to the cover). This is worse Learn Salsa dvd than I have bought. Why? Body position is incorrect, position of the knees very bad, they do not dance with the beat of the music, this dvd teach only the basic step but in the incorrect way. You are going to pay to learn only the basic step in the worse way.Mr Cal Pozo is not a Salsa dancer, at least in this generation!"
1,Is that all ?,"I was very disappointed. This is as basic as it can be. Though lessons are short, the instructor repeats it again and again as if he is in a real life Salsa course. You not need to be a fast learner, to get the steps in the first or second time as they are basic. The too long repetitions are annoying time consuming and boring. If you are slow learner like me you could replay the episode again and again on the DVD, until you get it. The hip motion is a good tip, and was well demonstrated, but to it was unnecessary too long. The Macarena lesson, was fun, but took a major part of the video. I bought Salsa &Merengue instruction video, and not Macarena. I believe all the lessons could have been edited into 20% length without compromising the value of the lessons. I did not feel I got my money worth , and when the video ended, I was looking for the missing 80%."
3,For beginners only!,"As far as DVDs go, this one is rather simplistic and not very well made. The instructions are very clear and easy to learn but it is for the absolute beginner. No fancy stuff here.Overall, a good intro to Salsa dancing."
1,1 good storm and their shot,30 days and 1 winter storm and these things are shot. I'll be getting normal blades for double their value locally because these things can't hold up to a very mild Minnesota winter.
5,Night court seasons 1-3,"This show remains one of my all-time faves because of its irreverent, sometimes politically incorrect humor. In earlier reviews I mentioned some of my favorite episodes, such as ""Bull's Baby"" from season 1. I like to add the Season 3 episode ""Monkey Business"", the one in which Bull befriends a monkey that's about to be used for medical research."
3,Doesn't quite live up to the reputation for me,"I decided to get Corelle because my mom has had a set for ages, and we are always commenting on how nice these are for everyday dishes. Overall, I liked my new set, if I had to be picky, I would say the cups were the only item in the set I was disappointed with.Some drawbacks to the cups were they were stoneware, not the Corelle ware that older sets are. Also the cups are quite small. Maybe they are good for Japanese style tea or espresso, but for a good cup of coffee or tea, I went out and bought some bigger cups in a coordinating color."
2,Corelle dinnerware,"I am a long time Corelle user, and want an updated pattern for our everyday use. I like this pattern, but missed the fact that there isn't an 8"" luncheon plate with the set - we need that size. The TINY coffee cup was cute, but basically useless. I was unhappy with the color quality also. I returned the set and will continue my search."
3,Solutions Manual does not contain all solutions.,The book is called Students Solution Manual by Albright Winston and Zappe for Data Analysis and Decision Making. On the inside cover the book clarifies that it is for selected solutions per chapter. The content is just selected problems from the book rather than all the solutions. Know what you're buying before you order.
5,Perfect purse!,"If you want to carry a lot of stuff, but want to feel as though you're not, this bag is for you! I'm a writer, so I always have to carry a composition notebook and a book, in addition to various sundry items like tissue, address book, etc. Everything fits easily! And if I decide to take a long walk, I don't feel as though the weight of the purse is dragging me down. It's great!"
4,Great Buy,"This was a product I owned and was replacing so obviously, I thought it was a great product. The even better part was I bought the original pair directly from Trask at over $150. The price on Amazon was $52. Exact same shoe."
3,Women with a sense of humor! Excellent musicians!,"I bought this tape on impulse shortly after its release. I just loved the name ""Rude Girls."" And they are: they make fun of female troubles, New Age sensitivities, and relationships in general. On the other hand, their ballads are beautiful and traditional, their harmonies tight, and their playing excellent. It's one of my all time favorites, and when I play it for friends, they usually want a copy!"
2,this sucker is noisy,"This product might be great for a warehouse, but in a residence, the sound of any setting above the small insect setting is very noticeable, and disruptive. We bought it for rodents, but the setting for small animals-rats, squirrels, etc, was not the barely audible level the sales materials claim. Not appropriate for any level of the house you are living in, except perhaps an uninhabited basement or attic. Perhaps."
1,Not satisfied,"I purchased this product to control birds in my Barn.After much research of this product i was convinced it would perform.As directed I gave it 2 weeks to show results. As of today My bird population has not changed,with the unit on med. the birds appear not to be affected at all.Also this unit has no effect on the rodents,this coulb be a result of the height of the unit.I don't find it practical to add another unit. The barn is 1254 s.f."
1,Save your money,"When I plugged this in, the noise it made was shocking. No way you can have this unit in your living space. I returned it for a refund."
4,SEEMS TO WORK FOR BATS,"We have a history of large colonies of bats in our area, and our house. I sealed all the entry points I could find. Our house is 120 yrs old, so there are areas that just seem to be impossible to find them all, except for the bats.I put one in the attic and one in the basement. Its been over a month and not a bat, I cant say its for sure these units, but with the problems I was having to none so far I have to think that they are working.There are 3 different levels of sound, I have to put it on the weakest setting and still no problems.If I have any bats I will post.For the money and no hassles yet its worth a shot."
1,COONS LOVED IT!,"HAD 12 SMALL COONS IN THE GARAGE AT NIGHT COME UP FROM THE WOODS. WHEN I TRIED THIS PRODUCT, WE ONLY HAD 9, SO I GUESS IT WAS NOT ALL BAD."
2,Junk,I pluged the unit in as directed only to discover the next day it didn't work! I tried several things to rectify the problem but to no avail. I took it apart and added an external speaker and it is working fine. I believe the speakers were faulty!
4,My Signature Scent,"I received my order in the time specified and am very happy to be wearing my ""signature"" scent again. The only exception to my happiness is that the sprayer is a little faulty. It leaks a tad bit, but no worries since it does SPRAY."
2,Skip for Kindle - Buy the Book!,"Disclaimer: I hate giving this book a bad rating, but I find it necessary to do so.I read this book back in high school, and really enjoyed the story. The characters are memorable, the story is excellent, and Barbara Michaels is an excellent author. Since I enjoyed it so much back then, I decided to purchase it for my Kindle.Bad idea. Whoever turned it to Kindle format did a very lousy job of it. Lack of punctuation, missing words... It makes for annoying run-on and/or nonsensical sentences that distracted me during my re-read. It tainted the overall experience and annoyed me to no end! I seriously regret buying it for Kindle, but highly recommend buying it in paper format!"
3,Mostly serviceable,"Right now this is the most complete Danish dictionary Amazon stocks. I agree with the other reviewers about its shortcomings. While it does give the gender of Danish nouns, it doesn't give the plurals. Some common idioms are listed, but the selection seems to have been made with Danish speakers in mind. I recommend using this dictionary in conjunction with a purely Danish ""retskrivnings"" dictionary like Politiken's Danskordbog. If you find yourself in Denmark, buy the two-volume red Gyldendals dictionary ($80 each, special-ordered at Amazon) edited by Jens Axelsen. Gyldendals, unfortunately, doesn't give pronunciations either. If you want something to hold in your hand while you stroll through museums, buy the Berlitz."
3,"OK, but not great.",This book would be better if more of the B&B descriptions included websites for making reservations. We found it more convenient to use online websites rather than phone for same.
5,Compared to any other BDSM related fiction...,"Laura Antoniou is far and away better than most. I was a little disappointed in Reunion, though. Perhaps I had been looking forward to it for so long that my expectations were out of whack. I found parts of it repetitious, and thought the book was just too long. (Never thought I'd say that about any book.) I did appreciate the mystery element surrounding Chris Parker and his role, though, and the fact that there was at least one character that you loved to hate. The erotic scenes were, as always from this author, outstanding. And, as always, I finished the book with the wish that the Marketplace were real..."
3,"Interesting stats and so forth, but...","This book could have been less biased. I found this book to be heavily slanted AGAINST living together, when it probably should have remained neutral, giving preferences to neither living together or marriage but offering sound infomation and advice on both. If you are looking for a reason to make yourself TOTALLY UNSURE about your life partner (that's what mine is, for better or worse; richer or poorer, marriage certificate or not) read this book. Luckily I wasn't easily swayed in the author's direction; I still managed to keep an open mind when looking at my own relationship, which is something that would have been IMPOSSIBLE for the author to do, naturally. So...after all the reading is said and done, and etc., the only thing that will help your relationship is you, your parnter, and your minds and feelings toward each other. No book has ALL the answers, anyway."
2,Not Leather Bound - Imitation,What a disappointment to see that this edition is not Leather Bound as stated in the posted product description but is in fact imitation leather. If this is ok with you then go ahead and order. Otherwise buyer beware. Someone messed up in Marketing.
4,Very lovely binding but TOO SMALL to read for long,"This Bible is a lovely, compact size for bringing church, beautifully bound in leather.Unfortunately the print is VERY small, and the lines are too close to together. I'm only in my thirties and I find it unpleasant to read for any length of time. This would not be a good study bible for that reason. It's best recommended as a bible to bring to church or work.I do not advise you to order this unless you really are sure you want it, because it comes sealed, and Amazon will not accept opened returns."
2,I got a used item for the price of new,"I paid full price for a brand new set, I got a used set. The packing was incomplete. It says 20 piece set but had only 16 pieces. I was disappoinited. I did return the item and got full refund but it was just a another hassle to go through for something that was not at all my fault."
1,"Nice looking, but cheaply made","I was happy with these earrings when I received them. Unfortunately, after only wearing for one week, the post broke off one of the earrings."
5,Extraordinary!,"Having picked this up years ago at a used book store and reading it then I did not fully appreciate these powerful teachings at that time (or i just wasnt ready-lol) however after being drawn back into these pages recently it validates much for me after experiencing an NDE. I can say that I agree with most of Daskale's cosmology from what i experienced in that state and his insistence on 'the exiting of the ego' which allows the entrance of Divine Spirit to enter into us more fully..there are other worlds besides this physical plane..I know this to be true, may you experience this from his words."
2,Poorly done...,"198 minutes that could be cut short to 20 or 30 minutes tops for what it teaches! The extras are also useless, badly put together and teach nothing -- the fly through is poor in quality, and the filming/camera work that shows the final house built made me dizzy!, given the ""nervous"" camera movement... Was expecting FAR, FAR more... Most of the video shows bag after bag after bag being filled, stacked, retc... on top of it, the presentation is amateurish and the editing is SO poor that it is not worth the money; this said, given the fact there isn't much available on earthbag building, I am still keeping in on my reference shelf... but I doubt I will ever need to go back to it."
3,Absent Father Syndrome,"Not as fond of this installment as the first two parts of Sarah. Again, the same actors, children have grown quite a bit. This part of the story is more about father & son coming to terms, not so much about the farm. Not bad, a little slow."
2,Lots of concepts and theory. Very little hands-on guidance.,"This book does a good job of explaining BW concepts and theory. But there is no hands on guidance or step by step walkthroughs. After I understand the general workflow and overview of what is supposed to happen, I needed other books and guidance to figure out the specifics of what needs to get done.For an SAP expert new to cubes and associated concepts, this would probably be very helpful. For someone like myself, who has used a few other BI/cube products, but is new to SAP, this book is a poor choice."
4,Good Book,"I had the first edition of the Book and some of the best ideas of SAP BW I indeed picked from this book. This is certainly for people more interested in the architecture of SAP BW not so much for people looking to build Step by Step. Highly recommended for people who are looking to design from first principles (offcourse from a Software package point of view) of how SAP BW core is coded and behave. Wish it may have covered the extraction bit, for standard areas atleast, in much more details though."
1,Um livro decepcionante,"Comprei o livro baseado nos comentários, e nas informaes divulgadas pela editora. Na contracapa a editora escreve: ""the most updated information on how to use SAP BW to design, build, deploy, populate, access, analyze, present, and administer data."" Na verdade, em vez de ""how to use"" deveriam escrever ""theoretical guide"". Eu fiz um dos cursos de BW da SAP, aquele que ensina a trabalhar com as queries de BW e ferramentas relacionadas. No curso aprendemos a trabalhar com os infocubos, mas no a criá-los. Como o livro recomendava a si mesmo para os leitores que querem informaes sobre como fazer o design achei que seria interessante. Vou no índice procurar por ""infocubes, design"": sabem quantas páginas tem? Uma (1), apenas descrevendo teoricamente o que é um infocubo. O livro mais decepcionante que comprei nos últimos anos."
2,"convenient, but short life","I like this humidifier because it is small and compact with a clean exterior design. Last winter I bought my second one. Unfortunately it is going the same direction as the first. Initially it has nearly silent operation, which is extremely important to me. Over time it starts to gurgle more and more. I think there's a design issue of the internal components. Also, after a year of use, the heating element's material seems to be flaking off.In short: Good, but only if you consider it to be a short term item-one season only."
1,Fire Hazard - BEWARE,"Had the same experience as NJbrit. We have owned this product for several years. One night, shortly after turning it on, it suddenly burst into flames 2-feet high. Fortunately I was in the room at the time.I have not yet contacted the company, but will also report this to the Consumer Product Safety Commission."
3,Murder in LaMut,"Though the story was ok, I found the ending less than ethical and morally wrong. Not the best of Raymond E. Feist's best works."
1,This one is a let down,I have read nearly all of Feist's books and this series was the only one I had to really work at to try and get through. In the end I was very disappointed in this book. It was really really boring throughout and only got ok towards the end. Don't let this review stop you from reading his other work. I have really enjoyed most of his books up to this set.
2,Made me schick to my schtomach,"All molasses, no zip, this treacly twaddle must give people who think Hallmark cards aren't sticky enough a real chance to drown in cuteness. The drawing style is superb and harks back to Herriman and The Little Hitchhiker, but the strip itself is deadly stuff. I can't schtand it anymore!"
3,Too big for intended age group,"My mom ordered this for my 6 month old daughter's first Christmas this year because we were looking for a great first doll and this one was very cute in the pictures. In person it was still cute but it was way too big. I guess I didn't realize how big 15"" is for a baby. By the time she would grow into the size of the doll she would want one for older girls so we returned it. Most first dolls are 10"" or under to give you an idea-at most 12""."
3,Flimsy product,"I really liked this garter belt but the plastic clips that attach to stockings are very flimsy and one broke the first time I wore it. Also, try to make sure that you get a good size because if it's too big, it won't stay clasped in the back"
2,Terrible quality,This was nice until it broke after maybe 5 wearings. The clips that hold up the stockings broke off one by one until none were left.
3,late arrival,"Sent for a two piece item.....it arived before the date I specified but only one piece came. I called vendor and they shipped the seond half of the item but it didn't arrive until after the 14th, which was the date of the party. At that point, usless"
3,Better books on the subject out there,"A good book with lots of examples of the negative side effects of immunizations, however, the Vaccination Guide is a much more comprehensive and objective book."
4,Essential reading for any prospective parent.,"In spite of being only a rather slim paperback , this little book contains enough clearly written and essentially accurate information to make it an excellent introduction to the problem facing young parents : do we vaccinate our children or not? Written in a very understandable manner and with very compelling evidence , I found myself wishing that this book had been available when my own children were young.This book quickly reviews many of the common childhood diseases , the complications possible , and then proceeds to discuss the effectivness of the vaccines and their associated risks. Evidence is presented that the vaccines , although highly touted for disease prevention , are mostly ineffective and risky. The only reason I rated this book 4 stars instead of five is the book is TOO concise and some of the subject matter requires additional treatment. The evidence presented , however ,is very compelling , and I highly recommend this book."
4,Great Music - Well Recorded,Bought the LP in the 70's. Bought the CD in 2010. 5 stars for the music. 4 stars for the recording. Jane
5,A Flawed Man,"After reading Csath's short stories on addiction I thought I was ready for anything, but his diary also chronicles some loathsome behavior towards women that disgusted me. While Csath is one of the world's best anyalysts of the addictive state, He's at least a cad, and at most a rapist. It's hard to believe that people used to think this way."
3,"Great Movie, Terrible Price","This is a great Western, one of my favorite Bronson films, but $27 is absurd. Give me a break! I will never own a disk copy at this price.Hey, why price it at just $27. Why not $47, or $67?"
1,Subtitles,"None of the other reviews warn you about one thing - the subtitles.My DVD had NO option of turning them off.So I could get English Audio with Simplified Chinese, Chinese, or English subtitles. You can only have subtitlesBe warned."
4,"Brilliant, but all mono","I own this amazing CD, and it's great, but all of the essential tracks can be found on the other individual Ace CDs, ""You Got Mind Messed Up"" and ""A Man Needs A Woman"" and most of the tracks here are on those CDs in stereo."
1,no connection to sony z525a,"The USB cable and software did NOT work for the Sony Z525A phone, purchased through Xcingular. The phone will NOT connect to the pc. The phone does indicate that it is charging through the cable. Uninstalled the software and tried again, with firewall shut off. Same result. Connecting a USB device should NOT be this difficult."
1,Worthless,"Another $2 down the drain. It's not so much the price of the item but why sell it if it won't work. It seems that it should have come with the CD and the drivers necessary for the cable to work. Like I said, it's only $2, but they add up and all those unsatisfied buyers probably won't complain because of the low cost."
4,nicely working fine with C510,"In my opinion, the cable is very nice and working fine with My Sony Ericsson C510. As soon you plug the cable in USB 3.0, it immediately start the charging and within 15 to 20 sec it recognizes phone connection on PC Companion. But the main issue is when you plug the same cable with USB 2.0, performance decreases a lot. This was not the case with my original cable and the one I have ordered earlier from some where else. I have lost my original cable and the one I ordered separately was broken after around 6-7 months, as it was made up of hard plastic I guess. The outer cover of this cable is soft, so that should not happen with this cable. Overall cable quality is good, can be purchased to charge Sony's some of the old fashioned phones."
5,mfe,I am very satisfied with the service. I received the order within days. The quality of the book was exactly as posted. I will definitely use this seller again!
1,????????,The DVD was in region 2 which cannot be seen on region 1 DVD-players such as those in the us and canada
2,"Only pins 1,2,3,6 shown in diagram on product label.","Stars represent product description, not the product itselfThe product description did not include the fact the the pin layout located on the splitter itself only has pins 1,2,3,6 on both female outlets. I was told you need all 8 pins to recieve the internet through a coupler/splitter product you use to set up internet connection between your gaming system and the television.8 pins male plug1 2 3 4 5 6 7 81 2 3 6 / 1 2 3 6Left outlet / Right outletfemale plug/ female plug"
3,not great for dsl,I purchased this hoping to split my phone line between the phone and dsl cable. Unfortunately this did not work for that. It does split phone lines.
2,splitter did not split,"I wanted to split the ethernet jack from the wall to split in two to use two computers, however, the splitter only worked for one, not the other."
1,know your items - split before buying,"When I clicked on ""ethernet splitters"" in your Amazon search box, the RJ-45 from Cables to Go appeared. I assumed that the device would split ethernet signals so that I could hook up 2 computers to one modem. I should have read your reviews. After receiving the item and having it not do that, the seller then wrote me that I needed another device. I now have an item that I do not need and the return postage is not worth sending it back. A trip to J and R would have saved me time and money"
1,poor product or need more instructions,"bought 2 of this kind one of another none of the 3 worked but on one side , tried to re-route wires but to no avail, I just wanta a splitter to work on both sides, Greywolfesc"
1,Not what I expected,I wanted something that would allow my husband and I to be on our DSL at the same time. This did not allow us to do so. I was disappointed. Perhaps I did not understand it's use. Everything connected properly but it only allowed one internet line to be used so it was not what I expected or thought I bought.
1,You can't split ethernet!!!!,"It was probably my own naiveté thinking that I'd be able to split my ethernet so easily. This is not the device you're looking for, only one of the out ports works at a time."
1,Dishonest business,Whithout the understanding of how an ethernet cable splits I ordered this so called splitter to split one ethernet port into two - like the concept of a phone line splitter. The online description did not say anything about the ethernet splitting function until I received the item which includes a full page saying that you cannot use the splitter to split one ethernet port into two. Well it was too late for me and returning an item of $5.00 + $7.00 Shipping did not make sense to most people and the merchant takes full advantage of this. It wouldd help if this full page description was a part of the online description to warn customers.
1,BEWARE! Do NOT buy from ANTOnline. This is a Rip Off!,"Unfortunately the other reviewers' comments were left after I had purchased this item. They are right. Not only does the Splitter not work, but the company makes you jump through hoops to get a response and their only response was if you opened it they do not take returns or give refunds. How are you supposed to know that the item doesn't work without opening it? So, save yourself the time and frustration and just pass by ANYTHING sold by ANTOnline or Cables to Go. Its a racket."
3,Is There Somthing Else That Can Be Stopping Router From Spliting,"What I needed out my Cables To Go 37133 2 - Port was to split / Combiner, To Split Motem Ethernet Signal thur RJ45 Splitter / Combiner but in witch it did not, How can it be done ? .Cables to Go 37133 2-Port RJ45 Splitter/Combiner Cable, Gray 6-Inch (Single Unit*)"
3,Trouble,I dont know if it is the modem im using or what but only one side of the double port splitter works.
5,Product review RJ45 Splitter,I have a few problems getting my Internet setup but do not blame this item. it is only one part in the system of cables and splitters and couplers. I like the fact that it is constructed well and will not break when put under physical stress.
4,splitter not router,could have used a version with a female end on the wire but the diagram showd what you needed to know to hook it up.
2,Re-review,"The original item I bought does'nt work, but customer service helped me a lot and sent me a new one which I am still waiting for to test the product."
1,It doesn't work,"I already gave this item (I even made the mistake of purchasing 2!) my review earlier and I'm reiterating it that the splitter doesn't work. And when I tried to inquire about returning it to the seller for a refund because I can't use them, I was told it will cost me more to ship it back. So much for customer satisfaction."
2,Dissatisfied,I didn't relize with the spliier connected that only one device could use the line at a time. I ended up installing a 2nd ethernet line.
5,Great read,"A tense, compelling read, taut the kind of inevitable, looming conflict that characterizes every good story, but with just enough of the comic grotesque to qualify as a great Southern novel. A pity it is not more widely read or more widely known."
1,cruel and not cute,"First, let me reveal my bias. I don't like the story of the gingerbread man - the story that the Matzo Ball Boy mimics. Anytime a character is anthropomorphised by showing a desire to live and is successful as a result of some level of intelligence and yet gets destroyed at the end - I get a little bummed out. I certainly wouldn't enjoy reading this to a child never mind explaining the celebrated cruetly at the end of the story. I just received it as a gift for my child and fortunately looked at it first - sparing her of any unpleasant image of a cute character dying and then being consumed by the brilliant people who were - yes, smart enough to outsmart a matza ball."
2,Cover to cover in 15 minutes,"Yes, I am a speed reader--but 15 minutes? I didn't learn anything that I didn't already know, and that was disappointing. I suspect that this little book is actually a sermon that was written down and published. Here it is: Four points based on Exodus 31: 1) The artist's calling is from God 2)God loves all kinds of art 3)God maintains high standards for goodness, truth, and beauty, and 4)art is for the glory of God. The book elaborates briefly on these points. This is not a bad book; in fact, I agree with the premise, it is a topic that is important, and the little tome is well-written. If you know nothing about the topic, this book is an excellent morsel to whet your appetite. If you have any knowledge at all about the subject, better to pass on this one and look for something more substantial. This might very well be the book for you, it just wasn't the book for me."
5,A Fun Read!!!,"I would recommend Kristin's Spa Girls books to anyone into chic-lit...there's friendship, faith, and fun all rolled into one series! Each of the three books has twists and turns that are unexpected. A fun read!"
5,Awesome Clarinet for Beginner,"I was extremely impressed with this clarinet. I ordered it for my 5th grader who had never picked up a musical instrument before. I had to help my son put it together the first time as it was a little tight, but by the time he went to his first lesson he was able to assemble it by himself. The very first time he tried to play it, he managed to make a beautiful sound. I can't tell you how impressed (and relieved) I was. I would highly recommend this clarinet. You can't beat the price nor the quality."
5,EXELENT FOR HUNTING,"YOU CAB TAKE OFF EASY ANIMAL SKIN TO CARRY IT BACK TO HOME AND YOU CAN FRIDGE IT IN SMALL PARTS, EASY TOS SKIN OFF THE ANIMAL WITH OUT CUT YOUR SELF"
5,professional service firm tool,Professional service firms are notoriously poor at marketing.The odd dynamics of partnerships as a business model coupled with the idiosyncracies of individuals within them make marketing hardwork. How do you get all partners to buy-in? What strategies do you use to make everyone an effective contributor? Harry Mills latest book cuts straight to the chase. Straight forward practical procedures. We are using them and they are working.As the principal of a mid-sized responsible for marketing I highly recommend this book to other lawyers and professional service firms.
5,Works great!,"I've been using this thing for a long time now and still works great. Doesn't always give an even slice, but for the price and ease of cleaning it can't be beat. Hands down best and easiest slicer I have used. Would definitely recommend."
3,A Solid If Not Spectacular Album,"This is a solid if unspectacular collection of songs from one of the founding members of the Dillards. After Doug Dillard left the group in 1968, Rodney carried on with the band releasing albums like Wheatstraw Suite, Copperfields and Tribute to the American Duck, which featured progressive bluegrass/country music. Many of the songs contained on Let the Rough Side Drag wouldn't have sounded out of place on these later-day Dillards albums, especially songs like ""Dixieland,"" ""Last Thing on My Mind,"" ""Sawin' on the Strings,"" and ""Blue Yodel #4."" In fact, the only original, ""Daddy Was a Mover,"" first appeared on the Dillards' 1973 release Tribute to the American Duck. With a running time of under 27 minutes, it's pretty skimpy, but if you're a fan of the late-period Dillards you'll find much to enjoy here."
1,Fly Away,"After listening to this CD for 8 minutes, I wanted to Fly Away...Far Away...Her whiny voice is brutal on the ears."
2,Where are the figures????,"My son got this as a gift for his birthday. The parents that bought it didn't realize the action figures were not included. I have been to most of the area Bix Box retail places and no one sells them. VERY USELESS toy without the figurines. I am taking one more day to look for them, and if no luck, it will be boxed up and returned.This is probably one of the worst marketing schemes I have seen where toys are concerned. How crappy to sell a dueling playset with no people to duel with. Very very stupid in my opinion."
3,Intelligent Plant Light,"I love my grow light but was frustrated in finding a replacement. The reviews I read said that Lowe's carried the bulb replacements, but they don't any more. I tried Home Depot, and Walmart. I finally found some on line, but with a hefty nine dollar carrying charge."
4,not just another travel book,"This book was recommended by our tour company (not a Turkish one!) to read before visiting Istanbul and some of Turkey on the Aegean coast. Initially, it didn't really engage me, and I only read about half of it before I left on my trip. However, once I returned home, I picked it up again and found it much more interesting because I began to recognize some of the things and places the author wrote about. What amazed me during my trip was the realization that I knew next to nothing about Turkey, its history or its people. Some of this is reflected in the book, but in a very personal way. The author has a very keen eye for detail and a very expressive writing style that conveys more than just details. It's definitely not a travel book, but colored by the authors personal experiences which include living and traveling in Turkey for more than three years."
3,"So,so...","I recommend listening to it before purchasing. I've been a fan for years and I feel a bit let down. ""El Amor Despues"" and, especially, ""Usted Abuso"" and ""Alfonsina y el Mar"" are the true jewels of the production. The rest basically drag, even though some of the lyrics have great potential. Some of the songs were written by acclaimed, international artists...that doesn't mean they're good. For Bosé's best work check out his album Directo '90!"
1,Not worth it,"I've had this for less than a year and found that unless you get a self winder or some other device, it tends to lose time. If you don't wear it continuously then you definitely need something to keep it wound up otherwise you'll be resetting the time every morning.Even if you've been wearing it all day, it seems to randomly stop working.Also, I bought it because it had the day of the week and date function but that stopped working as well. This version also has the Spanish day of the week along with the English which i was not aware of and really dislike and wish I could have turned off or not had at all.Don't recommend purchasing this watch at all. I should have spent the extra cash and gotten a citizen Eco drive instead as I was searching for a watch that did not use batteries. I used to have a Seiko Kinetic which only lasted about 5 years including having it serviced because the band broke at my expense. I doubt I will buy any Seiko watch ever again."
2,poor quality,I bought this item for one of my receiver group. It lasted one game. The ends have frayed badly the strap has come apart as has the stitching. I would not buy one of these again
4,Nice and warm,"It is everything it says it is. Got it to warm my mom's hands while she watched TV. She wouldn't use it, but I do, and I love it."
1,It arrived with a bent wand.,"I could not use it. Amazon was great about taking it back, but I ended up going to Sears to buy a new one. The reconditioned one was not packed as well as the new one so I probably would have bee safe buying a new one online."
5,worth the price,"As a graduate student, I consider every major purchase very carefully before making it. I couldn't rationalize the expense of this for the longest time, but having had it for nine months or so now I am so glad I did.If you're on the fence about it, go ahead and get it; it's really worth it."
4,Dyson Animal,It looked so confusing when I opened the box but once I figured what all the parts did I don't know how I thought my floors were clean before. I have cats and this is the only product I own that can keep up with their shedding. I did clog the hose attachment but it was easy to remove the blockage. I'm impressed with the suction and ease of dirt removal.
1,Plastic Wreath Box Red & clear (2 pk),"THIS IS HIGHWAY ROBBERY. I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT THEY ARE ASKING FOR IT. I BOUGHT THIS LAST YEAR AT WALMART (EXACTLY THE SAME PRODUCT) FOR A MERE $6.99. I COULD BUY 7 OF THEM FOR THAT PRICE. THIS IS DEFINATELY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE CONSUMER, ESPECIALLY NOW WITH THE SAD STATE OF OUR ECONOMY. I WAS IN SHOCK WHEN I SAW THE PRICE. UNBELIEVEABLE. BUYER BEWARE. IF MONEY IS OF NO IMPORTANCE TO YOU THEN GO AHEAD AND SPEND $50.00 FOR 2. I THOUGHT IT WAS AN ERROR."
3,it's ok,"I think my 4mo old is too young for it. Can't enjoy the pull apart peices, too big to hold, too hard to chew. Mirrors and colors on feet are small and not bright enough to catch interest. It's cute though."
3,baby item,I bought this for my grandson and he's really not old enough to get the full benefit from it..too much going on with it. maybe for babies a little older it would work fine.
3,My Son doesn't like it.,"I had high expectations of this toy. I thought it would captivate my 9 month old son. He paid it absolutely no attention. He is now 1 year old. He still doesn't care for it. I can count on one hand how many times he has shown interest and it was brief chews on the rubber hands and he was done. It is a durable, well designed, colorful toy. I have ran it through my HE washer, and hung to dry and (if you ignore the lint it pickes up) then it cleans fairly easily. My son just didn't care for it. :("
2,Get Right to the Point!,"I am not disagreeing that the book does not have some good information; it does for me as a seasoned artist. I was excited that it had lesson plans in the back. (After viewing them, they were not too exciting though.) I read the ratings before purchasing it and it sounded like I found the perfect book. However, after receiving it, there was one review in particular that came to mind and I must agree with that person who stated that in a nutshell, the book was too technical and not user friendly. I was intending to use this book with my students in a HS observational drawing class. That isn't going to happen. The key with high school kids is to provide as much information as possible within a reasonable amount of text so that they may get to work. The longer the text portion of the projects, the faster you lose them. I am interested in suggestions for a HS level text on observational drawing if anyone has any. I am glad I bought this book used!"
4,Nice Kettle,I like the style. It has lots of room. The whistle works fine. It should be hard for me to burn it up.
4,My Heart is HAPPY!!,"I eat butterbeans a lot, because as a kid, I heard they were good for your heart, but the more you eat them, the more you fart! ...Well, I tried to pass the gassy smell in my car off to friends as a burnt radiator hose, but now, it is only slightly musty, as I now have this great cushion!Tip: Don't use it to sleep on at night!"
5,The Stage script is even Funnier,"The musical stage script of Hairspray is even funnier that the film. It has such a witty , and humorous approach to a really valuable discussion. I am looking forward to producing it when it becomes available for High Schools!"
4,Buck Stockman,"This was a replacement for an old Buck Stockman I had owned. In my opinion, the new knife was very close to the same quality level of my original. While a small point or irritation, upon closing the small outside blade, it slightly hangs up against its neighboring blade and does not fully seat itself in the liner. Again, not a major functional issue, but with a knife of this quality, you would not expect something like this to happen."
3,took 9 days to get here,Good product and quality but would have gotten it on my next trip to town if I knew it would take so long to get.
4,no trouble with this single,the single trouble is one of my favs from P!nk.the bonus tracks:Delerium takes a bit to get used to. the chorus is strange and repedative but overall the song is very catchy.Free is the very different to the other two tracks. it is a very slow and powerful balad.a must for all P!nk fans.however after buying it I realised you can buy a version with the bonus video of trouble aswell as the 2 bonus tracks. so I'd get that one if you can.
3,Pretty Good,If you like her music you will love her new single trouble. It is along the lines of Get The Party Started just a little harder. The two bonus tracks are good. Delirium is a fast rock song while the third track is more slow. It also has the video for trouble.
3,so-so,"Despite wonderfully meticulous footnotes, Bynum often misses the forest for the trees. NT Wright perceptively critiques Bynum's work in that she seems to have misunderstood what Paul meant by resurrection in 1 Corinthians 15 and 2 Corinthians 4-5, which skews her interpretation of the rest of the Christian tradition on this."
5,"Romantic music, romantic voice.","What a great new voice! Most of the songs written by the artist, and it shows! His heart is in every haunting song. If you're in Love, or want to be, this is the album for you!!"
5,great movie,it was really excellent!! i love it. this is what im looking for. now i can enjoy it! thank you.
3,bad sync,In the final shootout the score starts too early when Blondie drops the stone.So all the power in that shot is gone.In the short version(2h40min)the score starts half second or so later.Also the new dubbing sounds quite bad.Good movie but not so good release.
5,The first time...,"I have ever seen this film in such a brilliance of resolution and color. Most copies I had seen before this of this movie were pinkish in color and just look beaten. If your a fan of westerns this remastered version is of amazing quality and endurance. You will see this movie like you never have before with the just amazing and absolutely brilliant restoration they did. So much detail you can see flies in the air, and the whites of thier eyes."
5,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly",I love this movie and have probably wore out the DVD. All the characters are great in it and it is a very good action movie.
3,You should watch the Italian version...,"I give this one three stars... basically I agree with the ""one star"" guys. The story is kind of a mess. I remember watching the Italian version five years ago or something and there the story made definitely sense. In the DVD you'll find those ""lost"" parts but... it is not like what I consider the original."
3,"Great movie, lousy audio","Thoroughly disappointed! The sound is HORRIBLE! It says it's ""Dolby Digital"" and while I didn't expect 21st century, state of the art 5.1 surround sound, I was shocked to find nothing but a mono center channel. IT'S NOT EVEN IN STEREO! (I was so stunned by the lousy audio that I didn't watch it long enough to see how the video looks.) Great movie, a ""psychedelic western"", I like to call it, I'm taking it back (I hope the store will take it, it's been opened). Lets hope someone redoes this DVD and at least gives it two channel audio. Sheesh, what the heck were they thinking?"
2,Broke right away,"I ordered different animals from Amazon to give to my nieces and nephews at Christmas. The only one to disappoint was the frog; one ""foot"" fell off after two flings, and my nephew was heartbroken.I gave the educational rating 3 stars; I don't consider it an extremely educational toy, but it does require a bit of understanding (learning to drape the toy over your hand instead of under, and how a slingshot works)"
3,Some things don't need telling,"Lewis Nordan is undoubtedly an excellent writer. He has also had an ""interesting"" if somewhat dysfunctional life. He shares with the reader selectedparts fo that interesting life. Several tales are indeed memorable. However, he doesn't seem to have an appreciation of when things might best remain untold. In reading the book and its at times startling admissions, I was at times repulsed. The good parts way outweigh the bad. So, I'd recommend it, especialy for Nordan's fans, but be prepared to be shocked."
5,Pirates play set is a perfect toy for a young boy,I bought my 5 year old son the Pirates play set. He loves every part of the toy. There is plenty to do and play set works great with both Star Wars and Pirates dolls too. It really allows your child to use his imagination.
2,Poor quality- very disappointed,"I bought this for my 5 year old and we finally threw it about 6 months after we found pieces all over the house and it just wasn't played with. When my son did play with it, it would just fall apart. He would get so frustrated that he couldn't fix it himself and we got tired of putting it back together. The pieces are supposed to snap together but if bumped, the structure would just fall down. He only played with it for about a half hour and was bored with it- and he is normally very imaginative. For as much space as this takes up and how poorly made it was, I would not recommend it."
1,Not an exercise DVD - just an explanation of the resistance band,"Yep, it even says on the back - ""Start here to learn the essentials....then try using the band with your OTHER Winsor Pilates workout videos."" This is not an exercise DVD. Just a long commercial for a product."
4,A Novel About Growth,"Shyam Selvadurai's Funny Boy is a very well-written, entertaining novel that takes us through the journey of a confused, young boy, Arjie. Growing up in any society can be one of the toughest challenges for any child. Learning about who you are and where you belong in the world are lessons that may take a lifetime to resolve. As Arjie grows up in Sri Lanka, he learns of what the world has to offer for him. He discovers what it is that makes him happy and what things make him feel unhappy. Selvadurai introduces the reader to numerous fascinating characters who help shape Arjie's identity. These include Her Fatness, Radha Aunty, Black Tie and Shehan to name a few. Arjie's dissatisfaction with masculinity makes him learn of his own sexuality. Funny Boy isn't really about being gay, or becoming gay, it is more about growth and the struggles children go through to come full circle with their own identity."
1,Not original dishes,"These pieces are copies of the original ""made in England"" dishes.We ordered thinking they were just like some old pieces we wanted to replace. Not so. These are cheap copies made in China and the details and shapes have been altered.Very disappointing and now a hastle trying to return them."
1,Never worked properly,"Opened the packaging, had multiple scratches evident on the DVD. It was horrible, attempted to play it just for hopes sake and 4 minutes into play it freezes, starts up a minute or so later and then stops again. My kid never got to see the whole movie. Only 4 minutes of it. Very disappointed with this product. Total crap."
3,Careful to bilingual seekers!,"My kids (2 and 4) love Tom & Jerry, and we are trying to raise them bilingual at least.. So one of the details I look for when buying a kids' dvd is to know in how many languages the cartoons have been doubled into (not just subtitles) Therefore when deciding to buy this product I followed the details describing this product (as of May 2012) as being doubled both in French and in Spanish... I bought it, only to find out that it was only doubled into French. If you are looking for a Tom & Jerry spoken in Spanish... DO NOT buy this DVD! The product details are wrong!!"
5,Satisfaction guaranteed.,"Wagner's Ring is, admittedly, not easy for the uninitiated to penetrate. The tight composition conceals its dark, primal secrets, sluiced with heroic blood. It is also exceedingly long, and the unwary explorer, even one mightily endowed with musician erudition, can become lost in its complex folds.However, Di Gaetani's treatment of this rare and sensitive circle provides ample intellectual lubrication for those who, in the words of the great philosopher Cobb, wish to ""go deeper."" After you have read this book, your resolve will stiffen, and you will find yourself plunging into the all-encompassing Ring again, and again, and again, and again, until the grand crescendo washes over you and you are entirely spent.As was true in the days when Germanic gods and heroes walked the earth, once you have possessed the Ring, you will feel ready to dominate the entire world."
5,"AWESOME PURCHASE, WILL NEVER BUT ANYTHING ELSE!!","AMAZING product!!!! Makes my skin glow!!! And with this price?!! So worth it. Highly, highly recommended to anyone who's thinking about getting it."
2,"Ok, but not the changes I was hoping for.","I used the product trio (cleanser, toner and lotion) twice daily for a month. I experienced no stinging, burning or redness. The cleanser is creamy and does not lather (I prefer lather).There was not any ""amazing"" difference in my skin. My skin might have been a little smoother, but not so noticeable that I could tell for sure. The breakout issue might have been a little better, not a lot better. I could not tell any difference in the size of the pores as the other reviewers say they can. The one big difference I could really see was that this product really ""bleached"" my skin - not an effect I wanted to happen.Those of you who want to lighten your skin / fade your tan - go for it. However, I won't purchase these products again. From a facial cleansing standpoint, I can purchase something a lot less expensive and get the same results."
4,changed skin,"I purchased this to try and improve my skin. i started getting mild breakouts here and there and while things could be worse, it was still irritating. i switched mineral makeups and tinted moisturizers thinking that could be the cause. after some research i decided to try this. it has been a month since i started using this. i am not crazy about the cleanser, it does not give you that ""clean"" feeling(i understand the reviews with the filmy feeling). i have found that the toner and face cream are excellent, not greasy and absorbs quickly. the toner is alcohol based but it really deep cleans yet it may irritate dry or super sensitive skin. i use this set at night and a oil free spf during the day to protect from sun. my face is smoother , more even toned and if i do get a small breakout ,it disappears in about a day. i only gave 4 stars instead of 5 because of the cleanser factor."
1,Didn't work for me,I was hoping this would help even my skin tone and reduce the appearance of scarring from old breakouts. It didn't help at all.Still looking for a miracle product out there!
3,"Good product, wrong part.","I ordered this cap for my 2006 Hyundai Sonata GLS, 3.3L V6. Although the cap looks to be a quality item, it did not fit my vehicle even though all the correct information as entered for proper fit."
1,DOES NOT support Smart Media Cards,Advertised as supporting Smart Media cards. It does NOT. Don't buy this if you are looking for a reader for smart media cards. Very disappointing!
5,Very Persuasive,"This book is very persuasive because the author used original references. When captured in a book, as here, they cumulate the truth so that one witness builds on another. The result is a very persuasive case for the authenticity of the apparitions in my layman's view. The weight of the evidence I thought was very strong."
4,Good start,This is a good book to get started on to get some background on how Medjugorje andhow it got started.
4,tikki bar,like john hiatt. jimmy buffett covers the tikki bar is open so wanted the writers version and so i got this cause i couldn't find it on itunes. good stuff
4,"Great unit, Works to unlock doors",I installed this for a customer (school) and it worked like a charm. Only ohter thing I needed was a angled wall mount so the camera can see the person better. good value for the price.
2,Disapointed,"I owned one Corelle dinner set and decided to buy two more because they do not break. However, after opening I was completely disappointed. The plates are thinner then in my old set and of different quality - still nonbreakable. But cups are made of completely different material - stoneware and they are breakable and white color. Picture shows different color for cups."
5,Liaison Cards,"Climbing down from my shelf after having been CI in the early 60's, I was thoroughly impressed by the effort to portray the value of positive liaison operations expressed by DeBatto and Nelson. For years the neglect of this one facet of many in the Counterintelligence (industrial) gem, left many veterans of the trade questioning how CI special agents could function when stifled by budgets and sterilized by policies.This story tells how leadership is weathered in guts and hearts not polished on the shoulders. And yet, while citing the errors of uniformed bureaucracry, vanity and venality, it gives a full play of the human dimensions that make an effective special agent - CI.In background investigations of yore one would be asked about the loyalty, integrity, discretion, morales and character of a subject to be considered for a position of trust and responsibility. Positive answers to that would compose the image of CI individuals collectively."
5,What's really beyond ?,"Very reader-friendly book. It has several cartoon-style pictures that help us ""visualize"" some abstract quantum physics concepts authors explore, always in a light way. Well, maybe it won't reveal you the meaning of life, but it will make you think over your own existence. But hey, don't just take my word for it: read it and you'll clearly understand why it is a hard-to-find title. But remember: you'd better keep it in a safe place, far from your fat cat and visits - it's not the kind of book you find every century.."
3,"Great idea, but signal degrades","I have a media cabinet up against the wall right against the cable outlet. I thought the angle connector would be a good solution and allow me to push my cabinet closer to the wall. It was easy enough to install, but it degraded the signal significantly. It seems to work okay with my cable modem, but not with my tvs."
1,An absurd account,"I have found this book very broing unreliable and a complete waste of time. No sooner had i started reading this book but i discovered the author had absoultely now idea or grasping of the subject at hand. I believe he needs to sit a rethink what it is he is trying to say because i does little more than confuse the reader. i have to regretfully state that the purchasing of this book was an extremely poor investment on my part.Mr Khan the author of this book is not qualified any shape or form to talk about this subject, he is not academic, scholar and does not fall into the maintstream orthodox muslim community and as such does not give even a remotely close rendition of his account. I am surprised that anyone deemed it fit to publish such a 'book'"
1,Avoid like the plague,"I bought this because of its specs. Cooled close to expectations given the room and conditions. Worked for one summer. Summer #2 - after the warranty expired - the exhaust squirrel cage fan blades disentigrated. I believe the plastic fan housing warped allowing contact with the blades. Called Soleus to buy a replacement. Once the phone mail hell finally answered my call without hanging up, the obviously new customer service rep after several false starts finally advised me they do not sell parts but for $45/hr will troubleshoot and fix the system - just bring it in. They are in El Monte, Ca. I am not. Cheap materials - lousy support."
5,History of Uranium in the Colorado and Utah area.,"A good read for people interested in Uranium history. This book would especially interest people in the Four Corners area. Althought this goes into some of the history of U, it is mostly about one man Charlie Steen. This book is not technical."
1,No very helpful at all!,"I was underwhelmed with how the ""...For Dummies"" book is put together. It was not helpful to me at all. I gave the book away the weekend after I received it. The person that thought they wanted it still hasn't used it, either."
2,Good book,"Dont waste your time or money if you have'nt read the other books, book realy did not tell me anything that was helpful in the use of the calculator."
1,Not of much use.,Not near enough detail to really understand and be able to use the TI-84. At least as far as I'm concerned. Don't waste your money.
1,useless!,"This is absolutely the worst reference book for any purpose relating to the TI-84! Very poor organization, very abbreviated instructions, no examples, and constant referring back and forth to other pages! Even the factory supplied manual is better and its not very good either! Save your money!"
2,You can skip this purchase,"The calculator comes with a manual that is better written and clearer than this ""Dummies"" book."
2,Uncomfortable,I ordered a size larger following others feedback and it was still too small and uncomfortable for my wife. She was never able to wear it. For the price it was not even worth returning.
5,Wintergreen oil,"Mice hate wintergreen oil, so I put it on steel wool and stuff it into corners of the floor, ceiling, windows, and door of my storage area. Have been doing that for some years now, and have had no mouse invasions since I started. It also makes the stuffy shed smell better.Some people use it in tea, cooking, and for sore muscles. I'm sure it's good for all of that, too, but keeping the mice out - unfortunately AFTER they chewed the faces off of my old Raggedy Ann and Andy dolls that my Granny made for me - is my best use for the oil."
5,exactly found with the same quality as was committed by the seller,I am happy and impressed by the fast delivery and also the quality of the item delivered to me.Thank you amazon and thank you the seller.
5,Gripping and educational,"Tom Juravich is a capable singer and musically, the songs on this CD are adequate (it's got a certain mid-80s top 40 feel to it). Nevertheless, this album is so much more than the sum of it parts. Particular standouts are Breaker Boy, a song about children working in the mines; Ludlow Massacre (words by Woody Guthrie), which has lyrics so powerful they literally made me cry the first time I heard them, and an adaptation of Florence Reece's immortal Which Side Are You On? This CD has been in heavy rotation for the past two weeks and doesn't look like it will be dropping out of the CD changer anytime soon."
1,"great size, but flips on in your pocket and runs out of batteries fast.","strong beam. great size. but you'll find this on inside your pocket, draining the batteries."
5,great keychain led light..,"This inova CB-W White Led and black grip product very bright and small.&#54620;&#44397;&#50640;&#49440; &#54620;&#44060;&#50640; 15,000&#50896;,&#54616;&#51648;&#47564;,&#50668;&#44592; &#50500;&#47560;&#51316;&#50640;&#49436;&#45716; $6.6 &#12619;&#12619;&#12619; &#12619;"
2,handy,it's handy in very dark places. easily fits onto a keychain. the bad thing is either mine was received with a weak battery or the battery life on this is extremely poor. it lasted about one week only. i have not changed the battery yet.
5,Zits-Sketchbook #1,I found this book to be exceptionally funny and have read several times over. I recommend this to any looking for a good laugh to cheer up a dreary afternoon.
2,The Words of Joseph Smith,"Although the book itself is invaluable, the Kindle version has one major flaw -- All of the links, regardless of the entry date, go to the footnotes for 27 Jun 1839. This decreases it's value as an electronic resource as those who own the printed version know that the footnotes for this book are a major reason to own it. Unless this error is remedied, I would not rank this electronic version higher than two stars."
4,Smells like heaven,"I love the smell of this cleanser -- it's like real lemon. I do find that it doesn't remove all my makeup so I follow up with a toner, but it's worth it for the mini-getaway moment of inhaling the fragrance with a hot washcloth on my face at days' end."
5,It is Babylon 5!!!,"Babylon 5 is the most intelligent sci-fi show I have ever had the opportunity to watch. This is the second season, a new captain and a lot of revelations. It is not the best of all five seasons, but it is very important to the future of the series. Therefore it is a must for every fan of good science fiction."
3,"Great Seriers, but the DVD . . .","This is a WONDERFUL seriers. A top-notch sci-fi drama! However, I cannot give it 5 stars for the simple fact that the DVDs are terrible! Several of the have many scenes that ""freeze up"" and ""skip"" places. I thought that there was a problem with my DVD player until I found out that many people were having the same trouble with them. However, I still MUST recommend this series, being that it is EXCELLENT screen writing!"
3,B5 transcends pedestrian in season II,"From a non-fan perspective; if you were turned off by the first season, don't fully give up yet. Some of the material made me cringe (especially in season I), but the show gets momentum toward the end of season II and ultimately shines in a few areas like better actors and CGI, MUCH better sets and lighting (though picturesque backgrounds are still an obvious eyesore), and the writing is becoming more bearable and even good at times. There is entertainment here for me, it's just not for the demanding. If your hesitant, wait for season III and get the B5 movie ""In the Beginning"", it's a great stand alone story (fifteen bucks?). The other ""movie"" on the disk is called ""The Gathering"" and will instantly give you an idea of how bad this show can get and will be the test of whether you'll enjoy season I (people seem to LOVE it)."
5,I am very happy with this item,I am very happy with this product not only did it arrive in less time than scheduled but it also arrived in perfect condition.
4,Pentax AF540FGZ Flash for SLR Camera,Great product. Fast Shipper. Flash is somewhat complicated to use if you try to use all the features.
4,Bulb,Not available in local stores. Pleased to find it on Amazon and at a reasonable price. Functions just fine.
4,"Very bright,","Exactly as advertised - it's a roll of bright, reflective tape suitable for sewing (e.g. non-sticky). It was shipped very quickly!Has an embossed pattern - as can be seen in the picture. In my simple test, the pattern seems to help visibility by breaking up the reflective blocks.Unknown if this is 3M branded product (I thought it might be) - irrespective, it is a bright, flexible, sew-able, non-sticky tape. (I haven't tried sewing it on yet...)"
1,Poor writing & little originality make for long semester.,"As a history major at Purdue University, I was required to read this for a Confederacy History class. Too many quotes and too little original thought made this a terrible text. It also seems to be highly antagonistic towards the South - very unprofessional for an historical text, as this purports to be. The writing style was very high-flown, and not at all engaging. The authors were also found to contradict themselves on several occasions. About 90% of my class-mates were dissatisfied with the book."
4,Great Product,"I really enjoyed the DVD. He is a very talented guitarist and provides great information in a format that is easy to follow. I appreciate the individual breakdown of the segments he plays throughout his extended example piece. I makes it easier to digest the material and see how the individual licks incorporate in the ""Big Picture"" of developing solos. The split screen of both hand's activity is always a blessing for this type of instruction video. Highly recomended."
1,no answer sheet,the book does not come with an answer section which is vital in order for this type of book to be worthwhile for the home student.
5,Look no further,"I spent the likes of three days trying to find a book that had a realistic application towards ATM and SONET/SDH technology. Practically by mistake I got lucky and found this one, (via the local bookstore). Not to say that others don't share the same depth, it's just that this one has a format that flows very nicely and is very well organized in thought and technolgy. It also seems to have the best collection of graphics, especially for understanding the bigger picture of device connectivity. It also provides a great history as to how the industry and need for this technology evolved, making it an ideal book for sales and marketing personnel. However, the author describes it as a post-graduate level book. So it is very specific, but its very easy to understand and flows in a logical manner. I can't imagine you would be disappointed. Feel free to write me if you have specific questions about this book."
2,Disappointing,"I found this book to be a real disappointment. While the words ""all kinds of families"" seem to open up a world of possibilities, the pictures tell a different story. Yes, the families may be black or white, old or young, married or divorced, or even include someone who is in jail. HOWEVER - the pictures almost always show an adult male and an adult female. As a single mother of two children, both of whom came to me through donor insemmination, I do not feel that this book sends an inclusive message to families that do not include a father figure."
1,Disappointment,"The title in no way comes close to describing different families. If your a male and a female with a house that seems to be the ""typical family"" this book refers to . There is no hint of diversity."
4,Enjoyed this book. It held my interest.,I liked this book much better than Lord Of Magic.I like Anne Stuart's use of a major female character and a minor one.
2,Not a page turner&#65533;,"I guess I'm the odd man out, but I just could not get interested in this book."
3,Bright but flickers,"I bought this direct from Sharper Image about a year ago. I still use it today. It is very bright and it clips to books firmly, yet doesn't destroy the pages. My very big problem with it is the light flickers if you breath while reading. I'm being sarcastic, but literally any movement of the light causes it to flicker and sometimes go out entirely (and then back on when you touch it). Maybe I've got a bad one. It seems to be getting worse the longer I own it. If this one problem could be fixed... well, I wouldn't be on Amazon looking for another light."
1,Inaccurate,"Many of the sources in this book are used incorrectly, almost as if the authors merely skimmed the primary sources they used to write it. Also many illustrations are historically innacurate."
5,My favorite book of 2003,"When I picked this book up off of the sale table, I thought it might be a bit outdated, (having been written in the late 70's.) What a gem! The chapters on riding in the Middle East are riveting. The chapter on riding in Florida is maddening. The people Barbara and Larry meet throughout their travels are amazing. And as you finish the book, you'll feel genuine sadness that Barbara is no longer with us. I felt as though I lost a friend. With only a few weeks left in the year...I think this one will stay in the top spot for 2003."
5,Miles From Nowhere,"Miles from Nowhere: A Round the World Bicycle AdventureOne of the best accounts of travel by bicycle I have ever read. It shows both the benefits and problems a couple can encounter when traveling together. It is well written and hard to put down. Another book I enjoyed as much, and a bit more current, ""The Lead Goat Veered Off"" by Neil Anderson, is about the month he and Sharon spend on the island of Sardinia, because they got to Holland too soon to see the tulips. For stories by lone riders, it is hard to beat ""Metal Cowboy"", by Joe Kurmaskie, and Spokesongs, by Willie Weir. All have been an inspiration to this lesser traveled bike tourist, and past president of our 1000+ member bike club."
5,Excellent touring book,This book was well written from the first person of Barbara Savage. It did not give details about how to proceed on a around the world tour of your own but it gave an excellent first person perspective. Barbara is a very good writer and makes you feel as though you are there. The book is dated in that it was written in 1983. They started their tour in 1978. I wish there had been more about the U.S.A. touring.
4,Miles from Nowhere.,"This is a true adventure story, true in more ways than one!. Some of the places they cycled through were lovely, but the ones that stuck in the author's memory and will stick in the reader's memory too were the places that were really scary, or were really awful places/countries from a facilities point of view. It's the sort of story where you can't wait to see what happens next."
3,Same As It Ever Was,"Good old Brylcreem! Isn't it nice to know that the products you saw your folks using when you were a kid are still around? My husband thought that this would be a good alternative to hairspray. It kept his hair in place but I didn't like the look. Still, it gave his hair a nice shine and made it easy to manage."
1,boring,"If you like big tattoo's and trashy women, this is the dvd for you. Ten matches and a kayfabe/shoot mix of backyard shoe scrapings will leave you wondering what happened to that $... you must have misplaced, oh yeah, you bought this .... Do yourself a favor, if you are an ECW/WWF fan, wait for the best of the Dudlys to come out, leave this dvd on the shelf, right where Lita's career will be when the WWF hype machine finds a new woman to gawk at for a few months.p.s. 10 matches of lita? Flair-Steamboat watch out"
1,Hell with this crap.,"If anybody considers to this the best of this s*** DVD right here, it would be that w**** herself, Lita! After that real life situation break up with Matt Hardy cause of her cheatingness by going out with Edge(yuck), she then lives in Atlanta again which I formely used to live at, but now I'm in Columbus Georgia.So much for this crap here, if Amy ""Lita"" Dumas wants to impress people like myself, then she should do the honorable thing what everybody normally does best is to, APOLOGIZE!"
1,Do not buy!,I bought this for my fsx and did not work t all! It even crashed my computer! So if you don't want to waste your money do not get this.I hated it.
3,i love this story,"hey there.i hope this finds you well.i saw a tv mini series on this years ago back in the 80's.i really became fascinated.nat geo, produced this and it is really good."
2,Not very useful,"I was looking for a novel guide that includes student activities--vocabulary, plot development, characterization, literary elements, etc.--as well as quizzes and/or tests. This one doesn't have any of those things. It provides excellent background information for the teacher, but none of the time-saving activities I hoped would be there!"
1,for sensitive readers - look elsewhere,"Read this book if you are mature, able to understand the complex symbolism in it, and don't mind gruesome and incestuous situations described in great detail. I feel the back of the book did not warn me enough. Besides the parts that made me uncomfortable, the plot and characters gave me little reason to want to even finish the book. I would recommend this book to any reader with background knowledge of Japan's complex history and culture, but for any sensitive, and especially young reader, you probably won't get much out of it."
4,Savage but not brutal...,"Good, fun puzzles. Seldom trivial, but not super hard. I use a pen, however not unerringly. I have a second volume to enjoy."
1,Mythology and Mistakes abound,"Glenn Tucker's work may make a good story, but unfortunately it doesnt make for accurate history. Chickamauga: Bloody Battle in the West presents a very flawed history of events that occured in that Battle of Chickamauga, from Claiming a courier Missed seeing a whole Divison in the Woods to laying too much blame on Bragg for mistakes that were shared with other commanders. Its better to get Cozzens, Woodworth, or Robertson's books on this battle if you are after an accurate version of events."
2,"Writing horrible, plot good","This book kept me reading in spite of the bad writing. Laurel keeps you wondering what's going to happen, yet I found myself skipping over much of it because I couldn't swallow the wording. I would love to quote the many examples found throughout this book, but I don't have persmission to do so.If you want to enjoy a good plot, grab this book. If you don't think you can take the bad writing, skip it. Although, in my opinion, the ending was a let down."
5,One Word...WOW,"WOW is all I have to say about this book. From the second I recieved this book in the mail I couldn't put it down!!! The characters demand your attention as they draw you into their reality and the plot is absolutly AMAZING. You don't know what's going to happen next and you can't wait to find out. I'm thrilled to know that there is a ""part two"" on the way and I want to be the first one to get it!!!"
4,Torn Thread,"This book can make readers to image the view in the ghetto and the camp. Also this is good for knowing how people were working in the factory and how they were treated.There aren't much scary stories in this novel, so it's good for young readers to start reading about the Holocaust."
3,Powerful and Touching,"This was a great Holocaust story, and gives a new perspective on the holocaust. INstead of being about concentration camps it was about a labor camp which is not heard about as much in HOlocaust stories. This story has a strong conflict. Eva and Rachel try to survive this camp while working in this camp. Without adequate food, hygiene, or good working conditions life is very difficult. This is a great story and must read."
4,Torn Thread,"Torn Thread is a great book. I would definatly reccomend reading it. It has great information from the holocaust, and is a less chalenging book than some holocaust books.Also this is a less saddening book than some others I've read from that time. Lastly I think Anne Isaacs did a great job and I think its cool how she's related to the main character. I would mostly reccomend this book to kids above the age of twelve and I would think adults wouldn't think it was as good but may still like it."
4,"un des bon ""dream mixes""","Un tres bon album de la serie dream mixes. Plusieurs vieux morceaux magnifiquement retravailler vraiement different des originals.

2,smells great... FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES!!,i love the delicious tropical smell. Just wish it lasted beyond the time it takes to apply it. less is not more.
3,Family Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection,"Although I have not seen all 50 of the movies, this brought back memories of more carefree days. Be prepared to view some silent films. The older films also took liberties with the original stories. The Man in the Iron Mask combined a version of the Three Musketeers with it. A lot of Shirley Temple shorts. Good if you like Memory Lane."
4,Family Classics 50 movie pack,I bought this product as a Christmas gift for my Aunt. She loves old movies and said these are great
2,So-So,"Not too happy with the quality of this package of movies. Also, I guess I should have read what was actually on this compilation.A LOT of old, old '20's and silent movies - not my favorites."
5,Family Classics 50 movies,Absolutely great collection of classics. 50 movies in one package. One regret is that the movies are in paper sleeves and hard to tell what is what. But the movies are irresitable. Brings back memories of childhood entertainment. Love all of the movies.
5,Whew.....,"I bought this collection last Christmas (about 9 months ago), and have finally watched all the films. I watched them when I found a couple hours here-and-there of down time. Seeing as I have never seen 95% of these, it was a real treat. Only one movie was so bad, that I couldn't finish it (Long John Silver). The rest varied from good to excellent. Just picked up the 50 pack of westerns, and am looking to watching all of them too. You'll probably see my review to that about 9 months from now (chuckle)."
5,HE THOUGHT HE WAS TOO GOOD FOR COUNTRY HE WAS WRONG,"When Graham Brathwaite loses his job as a symphony musician, he finds himself on a touring gig with a country band. It's a real learning experience for Graham, playing small towns and community halls with a motley mix of musicians called ""The Harmony Cats"". Debbie, the group's singer and frank, the band's leader help Graham shed his narrow-minded views on life and become a person with some ""soul"". Harmony Cats is a tribute to all those bands who play the small town circus, looking for that one big break into the big time and a fleeting moment of Fame!Featuring Hoyt Axton"
4,Good,"This show is just flat out funny. I watch it with my kids all the time, not really a greatest episodes dvd though."
1,Release seasons 1 and 2 and I'll buy them!,"Go away cartoon network. No one likes you anymore. Hell, I can find all the regular show, adventure time and any other show i want online for free..... I find the only reason to buy a cartoon dvd is to get the WHOLE season. Not this hodge podge. Come out with the whole season of shows and people will actually buy them. Even if season 1 and 2 together was like 30-40 dollars I would buy them. Stop being so greedy Turner/Cartoon Network. Otherwise I'll just watch online forever and you wont ever get my money, and from the looks of things, The majority of the fanbase agrees with me. Like you guys dont have enough money or something. You basically have the young adult to adult market monopolized with CN and then Adult swim. Whats youre problem?"
2,Overpriced poor writing,"This book seems to be written for undergraduates. It is, at times, insultingly simplistic. It is a very long text... and that is partly because the author is redundant and verbose. If he were to edit out all of the extraneous words he used, the book would probably be half the size it is now. For that reason and others, it is very frustrating to read. If you really must buy this, DO NOT buy it at full price. I highly recommend that you buy it used. It is NOT worth $85!"
5,Awesome. The best of this genre I have heard so far,"I highly recommend this one. It is the best of its type that I have heard so far. Mystical and serene, hitting a great varity of intermeshed tones."
5,A wonderful story of Africa,"A great story with adventure. It puts into perspective, what happened in Zimbabwe and much of emerging africa"
5,New Band CD,Congrats to the RCC Wind Ensemble for this new band cd.It's great to hear new works played well
4,A worthy addition to elementary school libraries,"I am a big proponent of the teaching of mythology to elementary school students, by examining the myths of many cultures, the students can be exposed to so much of how other people viewed the world before there was scientific understanding.This book is a reference work, containing explanations of mythical places such as Asgard, Lemuria and Hamistakan. The entire world is covered, with references to Chinese, Egyptian, African, Indian and Iranian myths. The coverage also extends into the more modern mythical places, describing placed referenced in works by Jonathan Swift, James Hilton, Milton and C. S. Lewis.A worthy addition to the library of the elementary school that explores mythology in order to teach multiculturalism, this book will answer many questions about places of the imagination."
4,"Amazing writing, but the plot could have been better...","I was drawn in by the idea of this book--an epic friendship between two women (because there seems to be so little of that nowadays), but to top it all off, one is straight and one is lesbian? Sadly, although I was entranced with the humanity of Ms. Jacobsen's words and with some of the completely amazing ideas/ideals that she came up with, I was disappointed with the relationship between Ashmont, Emily and Val. I really want to ask the author--Ms. Jacobsen, what is so unrealistic about a lesbian being friends with a woman and yet not being in love with her? I just feel that that was a plot point that would have been better served left out of this novel."
4,Handy light for keeping night vision.,"I bought this as a gift for my brother who often fishes at night. He can change lures, line, etc. without messing up his night vision."
5,A fabulous techno thriller!,"Techno thrillers are definitely not my cup of tea, however, this one is written so well and so clearly, that I was hooked after the first chapter. Most techno thriller authors get so caught up in technical details that they lose the average reader quickly. Not so with Chris Stewart. He captures the reader's attention from page one, and explains all the normally boring technical details in such a way that I never got tired of reading about them. This book was given to me by a friend, and now I am ready to buy more of this author's work."
2,Not enough whomp...,"I personally dont think this book is worth the money spent on it. While the premise and general idea was good, the Stewart failed to develop the storyline to its true potential. It could have been SO MUCH MORE!Characters were not well fleshed out, and ended up as mere skeletons. While Stewart does make an attempt to give his lead character Richard Ammon a personality and to try and make the reader feel for him, somehow he falls short. The result is a rather loosely pieced together character ensemble.Plot-wise, the book went rather slowly in my opinion. Again, Stewart does try to give us different angles from different POV's but to no avail.If you HAVE to read this book, get it from the library. Spend you money on something else, like Ken Follett's ""Jackdaws"" for example."
4,Great first novel,"I enjoyed this book tremendously. It was a little difficult to get into the authors writing style, but as soon as I did I couldn't put it down.I only sorry that he doesn't have another one out there. I would purchase it right away."
3,And then....?,"This book was like the movie ""Remains of the Day"". ""Huh?"" You say?Well, I enjoyed the little adventures John faced upon his arrival inBoonville and they kept me interested throughout the book. However,I kept waiting for the real story to start and then it ended - justas I was surprised when the ending credits scrolled up on ""Remains.."".I suppose having driven through Boonville many a time,let me get into the book more then your average yutz."
1,Boring!,"Adam: God's Beloved is a book written by Adam's friend and caretaker, Henri J. M. Nouwen. ...It is, by far, the worst, most mind numbing, book I have ever read. Sure, Adam made an impression on Mr. Nouwen and touched others who met him as well. However, is it really necessary to compare the man to Jesus? And for 128 pages, at that."
4,Fascinating historical novel!,"I really enjoyed reading this book! I was familiar with Michelangele as nearly everyone is... as the creator of the Cistine chapel's ceiling fresco. I also knew of the David statue and the of the Pieta. But I had never seen them first hand (still haven't). Reading this book gave personal insight to the man behind the creative genius! I had no idea he was so young when he first began to sculpt nor lived to be so old before death took him from his work. I didn't know his connection to the Basilica in Rome.... This is a very long, very informative book about the Papacy and the Warring Political factions during Michelangelo's lifetime. I am glad I read it. The only thing it needed was an accompanying book depicting the real life art as it exists today ( I bought that book separately so I could see in detail what the author was describing)."
5,"Loved the story, Loved the author","One of those books that is, for me, a classic. What a fabulous piece of history in a marvelous story format. When I was in Italy and standing before Michael Angelos's work, I was so grateful for the history of his magnificient talent and life's journey with that talent. Through Irving Stone's eyes, I was brought to an indepth understanding and appreciation of this man."
5,Behind Bamboo,"We had a friend who knew the author of this book. As a matter of fact, they were both taken as prisoners during World Was II by the Japanese and this is a real account of what they had to live through. Very interesting. I bought this as a gift for my husband who served int he Korean Was."
4,Beautiful Green Mugs! Sturdy Corelle Plates,"Simple, clean style. Patterned for the kitchen without being flowery, they're lovely for a more feminine decor but yet still okay by men. The green mugs are bright and cheery (better than the picture), though the green on the plates is a little more muted than shown. Standard, sturdy, light-weight Corelle material for the plates and bowls. The salad plates are a bit small, though this does lend them well for portion-control with desserts."
5,Wonderful Baby Yarn,"This exceptional baby yarn knits up beautifully and very soft - almost like a very soft terry cloth. I have been using this for baby blankets, sweaters, hats, booties, and everyone loves the product. I recommend this yarn very enthusiastically."
1,Wrong picture amazon dudes!,"The image connected with this knife depicts a folder with a nice wood handle.It's description, on the other hand, states that the handle is rubberized black thermoplastic."
2,Not worth it.,"The price of the product had me leading to believe that it would be some amazing,y detailed product. It's a small DVD sleeve with a DVD in it. Not worth my 40 hard earned dollars."
4,Fun ride,"Path of the Assassin is the first book by Brad Thor that I read. It's fiction, so just like Hollywood, there are a lot of improbable scenarios and circumstances that occur in the book. But hey, I accept that, cuz it's fiction. This book is one fun ride that kept me tossed and turned around curves. I enjoyed it thoroughly and finished it in a couple of day."
4,Thriller,GREAT YARN. FAST PACED THRILLER WITH A GOOD PLOT. Lead character is appealing and so is the female lead. Thor is a great author of action novels.
5,great books,"I bought several of the Brad Thor books for my husband, so I haven't read them but he did and he loved them.. He is usually a pretty slow reader but he read all 4 in two weeks. And I was not to disturb him while he was reading. Ha-Ha!!!"
3,Ho hum Kaboom!,"If you need pure escape into super spy land with plenty of near escapes, explosions and a hero who knows all and can do no wrong, this isn't a bad pick up for afternoon read.Mister Thor has done his research regarding the topic (although, I have some trouble believing Abu Nidal had a son no one knew about). He has a firm grasp on units and organization. However, this was a novel that reminded me of those martial arts films where people perform impossible leaps and jumps. His hero Scot Harvath seems capable of any feat - he has no weaknesses - and that isn't real.When the main character stretches believability past the breaking point, then the entire story suffers. This would have been a better book if the hero was a little more human like the rest of us mortals."
1,Path of the assassin,Excellent book was good on the elliptical at the gym. When the time was up I always said not yet.
3,Enjoyable Thriller,"This is Mr. Thor's second novel and it's a breakneck ride from the first sentence to the last period. I was exhausted by the time I reached the last page. I thoroughly enjoyed his ""The Lions of Lucerne"" and pre-ordered ""Path of the Assassin"". Mr. Thor's second novel, while still good, is not as good as ""Lions"". Hopefully, Mr. Thor's next installment in the life of hero, Scot Harvath, will have a little more plot and a lot less testosterone. There was a little too much verbage about how much smarter, tougher, and more heroic Mr. Havath was than anyone else in government service (this is what stopped me from giving four stars). We accept this; just get on with the story.This is still a good thriller -- and it's one thrill after another. The story line was right on and liked the twists and turns. Also liked the heroine and the fact she can keep up with Mr. Havath; hope to see more of her. Looking forward to the next installment."
3,too thin and popcorny for me,"It was ok I guess...but honestly, I found the book too shallow. The characters lacked depth and everything seemed to work out perfectly for the protagonist. I also found the premise of Scot Harvath, the protagonist, being a Secret Service agent a little hard to follow as I don't think Secret Service guys have the freedom to run around the world shooting at people and blowing things up.Sorry Mr. Thor, but your books are a tad too thin and popcorny for me."
1,awful,"true one can glean some interesting information about weaponry,warfare and such but Thor needs a couple of years in writing 1,2,3,4 until he gets it right.very formulaic and ultimately boring."
2,Lacking in details.,"For an author who traveled the world and actually visited many of the places in his novel, his details regarding places are so flawed they completely ruin the ability to ""suspend belief"" required in many novels of this kind. The liberties he takes describing events on the Island of Capri are so far beyond what actually exists on Capri, I almost quit reading. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone, especially those who like Clancy who does tend to get details correct."
5,True Stories of America,"A fabulous primary source, all American History teachers should have a copy!!! This book is full of stories about the lives of many men who lived by ""riding the rails."" It tells how men, boys, and a few women, made their decisions to leave their families and how they survived on their own. My grandfather's story is included in this book. As I read his story next to the stories of others who lived during the same period, a great picture is painted of what life was truly like for so many Americans during the Great Depression."
4,"Sad, Moving Stories Tinged with Triumph","I am sorry I never had a chance to see the documentary, Riding the Rails, because as moving as the book was I can see this approach and this material working so effectively on film. I will, of course, now see the documentary.I was very moved by the stories in this book. This is not in any way, shape or form a scholary historical study of the phenomenon of kids riding the rails during the Depression. Instead it is a panorama createde from various of their stories and all the more beautiful for their tales having been told in this manner. The ways in which these kids were helped along the road and how these experiences changed and enhance their world view was particulary note worthy. Receiving compassion taught compassion. It was a scary, important time and it was nice to hear some authentic voices from that period."
2,may be a fluke but...,"I bought this drive and couldn't get it to mount so I had to send it back - LaCie support was kind but could do nothing to help, they said it was defective."
4,cheap mass storage,"Like an extra storage closet in a basement prone to flooding, this is a decent solution for storing large amounts of non-critical data. They're certainly not the fastest drives out there, and I don't have great confidence in their stability, although they've given me no trouble so far. I have two of these units attached to my iMac, and I'm basically mirroring data between the two in case one of them unexpectedly goes south. Oh yeah, they're cheap and stack nicely. For my upcoming purchases though, I feel that it's probably time to move up to a bit more solid 500 GB drives."
4,"Canadian DVD is superior to this, and more expensive.","This Platinum U.S. DVD release is mastered from their VHS masters. Get the Canadian DVD release, it looks very good. Yes it is quite a bit more expensive (cheaper if you buy it directly from Amazon.ca, the Canadian division of Amazon)."
4,Great DVD--terrible packaging and engineering,"Despite only lasting three seasons, Due South has spawned a number of loyal fans. The show depicts the adventures of Mountie Benton Fraser and Chicago PD Detective Ray Vecchio. The pair work together to solve crimes with the occasional assistance of either Ben's or Ray's dead father's ghosts, Ben's deaf wolf, and several others. Episodes have wonderful, quirky humor and an excellent selection of then-up-and=coming Canadian musicians, e.g.: Sarah McLachlan, Ashley McIsaac, etc.The one reason I gave this set less than 5 stars was the quality of both the packaging and engineering. I won't belabor the point about the poor package design and labeling. To preserve your disks, put them in another CD case. Engineering, on the other hand, is dreadful. I can see ghosting and artifacting on my 27 inch TV, so I can only imagine what it would look like on a larger screen.Season Three is on its way and I am hoping the quality is much better."
1,Inadequate Info on amazon; puposeful misrepresentation,"Received the product and was greatly disappointed even without using it. The amazon description was purposely inadequate. Smaller than expected. The statements like 2.0 gallons output make one think that the reference is to tank capacity which is only 0.5 Gallons. I would remember to be careful about buying anything online that I have not personally looked at in a store. Return policy of Allergy B Gon requires a 10% restocking fee and paying the previously free shipping charges, making returns a second mistake on the same transaction."
1,Horrible,"Product leaked on the first night that I used it, only lasted 5 hours as well. Had to refil in the middle of the night since it wasn't producing any mist and kept making noises. Not a quiet machine, returning asap."
4,Perfect for RV's,We travel in an RV 8 months a year and stay in very dry climates most of the time. This humidifier is just the right size to raise the hummidty to keep the wood in the RV from shrinking too much. It also helps keep our skin from drying out. Sometimes the unit is hard to get started and sometimes makes noise. Both are not big issues but just the same it you should know this prior to purchase. Good unit and will keep going throughout the night.
5,Personal Humidifier,"The emphasis is on the word ""personal,"" which translate into small and something you can take with you to any room: bedroom, living room, etc. Be prepared to fill and refill the water about every 3 hours or so. If you take it to the bedroom, it will not last the whole night! That alone reduces its usefulness to many people.Beside capacity, another real serious shortcoming is the mist. If you put it on the floor, since its height is only about 7"", the mist does not shot up high enough. It falls right to the floor. It needs to have a longer funnel that extends out a few inches. I like to use it in the bedroom, too, but I don't want it to mess my dresser, nor do I want to get up in the middle of the night to refill it.Now I put mine on top of fireplace mental when the fireplace is on. So the mist does not mess up the carpet or floor. But each time I turn around when I am working, the water is half empty! With that limitations (or irritations) I still rate it highly."""
1,NOT GREAT,This product was a waste of money. The device leeks and the mist is a white dust. had to throw away after only a few uses.
2,Non-stop mist only to wet surrounding area,"This unit lacks a fan or moisture control, it just continues to spray moisture and makes the immediate area wet. I don't think they should sell this item given the poor design."
1,dismayed,I obviously did not realize this was a 14 page BOOKLET. This should have been offered for free on the website that mentioned this author; I paid .75 for the booklet but 6 times as much for postage. The booklet only covered conversing with an aging parent. I was very disappointed; I expected more depth and/or information.
1,Please don't read this book!,"If you read this book, which is part three of Dave Duncan's ""A Handful of Men"" 4-book series, then you may be tempted to read book four. That would be an utter waste on your part. I really enjoyed Mr. Duncan's ""A Man of His Word"" series, which is the prequel series to this one, so I picked up this series expecting more of the same or better. Boy, was I wrong! This book itself may deserve 2-3 stars, but book four, The Living God"", is SO bad, that it lowers all of the first three books' levels. It is not just bad. It is attrocious! Only read this series if you really enjoy being disappointed."
1,TOO DIFFICULT FOR BEGINNERS OR EVEN INTERMEDIATE STUDENTS,"This book simply has too much information that tries to be packed into the limited number of dialogues and chapters. It might be a good quick review for people with very solid Korean language background, but it's certainly not a book that someone would use to start learning Korean."
2,needs improvement,"this is an alright course... it does a REALLY nice job of teaching you to write korean, but that's about it. The rest of the lessons are hard to understand. It doesn't talk much about grammar or anything, and has almost nothign on verb conjugation."
1,Has to be the weakest volume in the series,"Unless you're looking to complete a set, or you just happen to like one of these episodes on the disc, this volume has to be the worst one. I've seen all 43 volumes, and some are packed with great episodes...Volumes 2,3,8, and 11 are examples of all 4 on the disc being well made and well written. Caesar and Me and Sounds and Silence are the bottom of the barrel. Krozers Noshe. I would only buy this if you wanted to place the disc face down on the sidewalk and scrape it with your foot."
1,Another Chinese rip-off,Are there any knives made in the USA?Shame on Amazon for hiding the truth. These are not US made as indicated.
3,Does not lock,"Good knife, but I would love it so much more if the blades locked into place during use. Came sharp from the factory and retains its edge well. Slightly dangerous for using to whittle, though."
3,On the heavy side,"A little too heavy to be comfortable in my front pant's pocket. Surprisingly heavy - but it's basically a hunk of steel. Take the dimensions and think ""chunk of steel"". Seems like it wouild be a nice camping knife though (but not backpacking due to the weight)."
2,Poor quality,"The cups I got have hard red lumps on them that won't come off. These cups work, but they are definitely low quality."
5,Sturdy,"These bolts are pretty thick (but not overly thick), so i know they won't fall off the post like previous lightning bolt/star earrings i've owned.They look great with just about anything, and they're absolutely perfect in the higher hole, if you have your lobes pierced twice."
1,Not my cup of tea,"I have known these artists for a good 20 years now, and have seen 2 of them in concert many times, but I didn't like this album at all. (I listened twice then gave it away.) It has lots of sad and ballad-like songs, which is not my fancy. Perhaps some like this style better than I, but I was really disappointed since I have always liked these artists."
3,grandpa,I haven't put together yet but I anticipate being satisfied with product but not rating guidelines they have put in force
5,Fantastic!,I recommend this book to anyone but especially to all mothers. I especially enjoyed the relationship between Jennifer and the nuns and the way her spirituality matured and she learned to accept the people she served while she brought babies into the world. The stories of these births were fascinating
4,A great book to read!,"I really enjoyed this read. It was one of those books that really captures the time it was set. It's intriguing, sad and enlightening. Although it is one of the shortest books i'v read."
4,Meet Some Delightful Hard-working Ladies,This is one of few books I have read lately that I found hard to put down for any length of time. I was amazed at what life was like in London in the years covered by the author's service. It was much more primitive than I would have thought it would have been in the '50s! The life of the midwife was fascinating and no doubt very beneficial to all those pregnant ladies! Anyone who enjoys reading human interest and/or medical services stories would like this book.
3,Mini-series much better,"I read this after loving the BBC mini-series, hoping that like most books, it would be much better with more depth to the story. That was not the caSE."
5,Call The Midwife,"I absolutely loved this book. I learned so much about childbirth,and the terrible hardships these women endured. It was bothexciting and at times heartbreaking. I loved the characters,especially the nuns. Great Book"
4,Not to be read before dinner.,"This book is graphic in its descriptions. you need a strong stomach when reading this.It could also be recommended reading for slimmers! I was surprised that in fairly modern times, for London certainly, this type of lifestyle took place. You also see the sincerity among people who are joined in poverty.definitely worth reading, especially in a reading group."
5,Call the Midwife,"I decided to check out this book after watching several episode on PBS. The book is well written and keeps your attention throughout. It really ""fleshes"" out the characters and makes you want to know more about them. I highly recommend this book both to male and female readers. It really gives you a look into post-war London."
5,Book,We loved the TV production and then I loved the book also! Both a little different though. A good read!
4,Takes Some Tinkering,"These ""universal"" fenders did not fit, at least not totally and definitely not at all when I tried it in combination with my rear rack. However, after buying some longer screws (and a couple shorter ones) some lock tight nuts and a whole lot of zip ties at the hardware store I made it work.I bought the yellow version so it wouldn't fade in the sun as bad (plus you can't beat ""free"" shipping). Once I got them on they did their job perfectly, that is keeping all the mud and rain from spraying my face and back. They're nice and light and seem to be sturdy enough. No complaints so far. Just keep in mind that the install might take a bit of elbow grease."
3,Too light,"I thought this pendant would be bigger and heavier, but it's so light it moves around on it's chain throughout the day. It's pretty, but not as nice as I expected. I don't think I'll be buying jewelry I can't try on beforehand anymore."
3,"Good charm,bad chain","Got for the wife, it looks great and she likes it....but she informed me,the style of chain that it came with gets caught on her hair. When she takes it off some hair comes with it,not good. So she just puts on a different chain when she wants to wear it. I say if the person your buying it for has short hair buy it, but if they have shoulder length hair or longer plan on buying a replacement chain and consider that when looking at the price."
5,Loved it!,"I bought this necklace and the matching earrings. I love them both, and have received a lot of complements on the set."
2,Thick book... tiny content,"I did read all these great reviews and finally decided to buy this book.To summarize - its rather disappointing.Lighting? Not so great on it. Retouching? Beauty retouching technique (yes, no plurals) is pretty much ""blur + brush"".. With some texture to throw in. Sharpening technique (yes. No plurals again) - well.. not a lot of use - could be better done with LAB space. Most of colour discussion is about RGB space. Excuse me, what happened to CMYK and Lab? Bits about calibration - yes, nice, but not a lot of details. Its almost like someone thought up an idea for book, wrote few chapters then got sick of it, and started to throw in random thoughts and ideas just to fill up space.I woulnt recommend this book to anyone who ever read Welcome To Oz! or any other decent book on photoshop."
5,Fits like a glove,"I love the ergonomic fit of the handle of this knife. It fits my hand perfectly and allows me to direct some pretty serious downward pressure which is good fof breaking apart ligaments, popping knees or hip sockets open and that sort of stuff. It's a rubbery feeling material on the handle that is non-slip, an important thing when skinning a critter so you don't slip and hurt yourself.It's a solid feeling knife that holds an edge well. Plus, it's a BUCK knife and they're the best as far as I'm concerned. Made in the USA!!!"
3,Too small,This bag was a little too small for my needs. I was also not a fan of the fabric once I saw it in person.
5,Beef is Beefy,If you're into the rap culture and you want to get a perspective of the various rivarly in that industry I definitely recommend it.
5,Fascinating nutshell,"This is a great little book for the combined careers of Lorre and Greenstreet. It doesn't go into as much detail as thorough-going biographies (such as Stephen Youngkin's excellent life of Peter Lorre, ""The Lost One""), but is none the worse for that. Highly readable, entertaining and informative - thoroughly recommended to all."
3,Nice but can be better,"i got two of them and work nice, the only problem is the blue led light, is too strong. But if you will use in your office it is ok."
5,"Great Vacuum- great suction, easy to use, and quiet.","This Kenmore Progressive, Elite upright is excellent and far superior to the several Hoovers and one Eureka I have used through thirty years of vacuuming. Hoover does not make them like they used to. This Kenmore is bagless, beltless, is nice and quiet, and has a nice long cord. It has great suction for carpet and tools on board, as well as settings for bare floor. It has a nice handle for carrying up and down the stairs, which for me is good since I have a multi-level home.It lists for $349 but I got this on sale at Sears for $240. You might buy a cheaper vacuum, but I don't think you can find a better one. I love this machine, and I did a lot of research. I'm very pleased with my choice. By the way, my local Sears did not have it in stock, but I was able to order it anyway on line, and they delivered it to my local Sears where I could pick it up. They notified me by e-mail when it was ready. It was very convenient."
4,Good,"Good cd, more consistent than the first, and an overall better listen, but lacking some of the stronger more upbeat qualities the hit singles on Read my Lips contained. Still worth the money!"
5,Outstanding!!!!,"I bought this album just a few days ago and i dont know what took me so long to get into S.E.B. I loved ""murder"" but didnt buy the album. I logged onto her website and watched the video for ""mixed up world"" and was hooked. That has to be one of, if not the best songs of the new decade. The entire album is awesome. Pure disco/pop the entire way through. I have heard this album didnt do well in England which is very surprising. I am also surprised that she does not have a record deal in the States. I think she would go over huge here. She is extremely talented and writes all of her own songs. Her music style reminds me quite a bit of kylie minogue as it is pure pop all the way through. She is coming out with a new album soon and i cant wait for it. Good going Sophie!!!! You have a new fan in the States."
3,"Very basic, but it functions.","There is no beep.When taking measure, it is easy to touch the button to switch it off. But if you use it carefully, it seems to give a good measurement.I would rather spend a few more dollars to get a better one."
5,Helping mate to keeping your sanity.,"Mommy Ceo is a helpmate. It is a great guide for new parents who have never had to deal with children before and children's constant stages of testing parent's love for them. It addresses all stages of development until they are out the door. Common sense is needed in all relationships and a habitual show of consistant loving guidelines given by the parents to the children is ever needed. Mommy CEO reinforces these techniques and gives the parents professional resources for more in depth help. Plus, the author is open to all questions. If you have an immediate problem, e-mailing the author will get you a quick response. I had a concern for my grandson in kindergarten and she e-mailed me in return within 24 hours. I have given the book to many parents who have appreciated it and have used it as a guide in their families. I recommend it for all households."
