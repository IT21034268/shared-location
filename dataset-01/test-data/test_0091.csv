1,"Please, no quickening","This first literary endeavor by the actor,comedian, and self described ""sexual pioneer""(?!!) is a disappointing effort. Although I really enjoy his work as an actor, this book is amazingly lacking in humor and laced with self-indulgence and condensation. (Yes Larry, we know why native Americans are called Indians.) The only bright spot for me was a poignant story about racial prejudice toward the end of the book. If you are looking for laughs, keep looking.One can only hope there will never be a ""Spoiled Rotten: the Quickening."""
1,Can't get the popsicle out of the container,"I was really looking forward to this product. After attempting to use it to make pudding pops, icecream pops, koolaide pops, etc, I have finally decided that they don't work. The popsickle does not come out of the plastic container. I called the company that makes them and they did not have any suggestion as to how to make these work. They told me to return them to the company that I bought them from. Well, my husband threw away all the information because he was frustrated so now I have these plastic things that are worthless. I don't recommend these to anyone. If the company would like to contact me and do the honest thing and let me know either now to make them work or how I can get my money back, it would be nice. I am sure this won't happen. I guess this is the way you learn your lessons the hard way in this world. What a rip off!"
1,Poor design,"There is nothing easy about using this product. The sticks which came with our set were much smaller than the slot for them, so they float up out of the slots at strange angles. You have to let the icepops partially freeze (about 1/2 hour), then remeber to jam the sticks in. Also, the only way to get the pops out is to run hot water on the mold, which defeats the purpose of having a nice icy pop. There must be a better product out there."
2,They make pops,"Just dont try to get the pops out after, the plastic mold doesn't release from the metal tray. Unless you plan to remove all pops by placing the entire mold in a container of hot water."
1,Save Your Money - Or Buy Mine for Cheap at Goodwill,This popsicle form is pretty much useless --> Impossible to get the popsicles to stand straight (and thus be able to take the top off to get at the popsicles) without constant babying.> What family eats 10 popsicles at a time? Must take the top off all of them to get out just one popsicle. Then what about the other eight or nine?I do love the traditional shape and read both the positive/negative reviews before purchasing. But this one's a bust. I've purchased another that better suits my needs elsewhere - it's not sold on Amazon.
5,Great Product,This was my first set of popsicle molds but they were great easy to use. I accidentally purchased two and was glad I did I've made 25 varieties of popsicles and counting.
2,Difficult to insert wooden sticks,"The tolerances on stock wooden sticks just aren't tight enough to expect an easy fit with every stick. Some slid in too easily and didn't stay put. Others couldn't be pushed in. Worse, some couldn't be removed after freezing without breaking the stick. They need a better system for holding the sticks or offer custom sticks. The pops looked nice though."
4,Great Popsicle Mold,"Received this item yesterday and couldn't wait to try it out.Blended strawberries, white grapes, honey dew melon, and watermelon with some peach yogurt and poured it in.Had trouble getting sticks into the metal slots, but I just pared them down with a razor blade and they went in easily. I guess because my concoction was so thick, the sticks didn't sway like other reviewers said theirs did.Froze up beautifully. Ran the base under some water, and they popped out quickly. I had a tough time removing the metal lid, but nothing too troublesome. The second batch I will pare down the sticks the whole length so when I remove them next time, they should be easier to manage.Put the extras in a separate container separated with some wax paper and started the second batch now.Cherry yogurt/vanilla icecream and frozen berries. YUM! The 'leftovers' are so tasty ~ can't wait to try the finished product."
4,Pretty good stuff,It smells really fantastic. But I'm not really sure what it is doing for my hair - I don't see much of a difference and my hair is still pretty tangly after using it.
3,Disappointed but so it goes!,"I had a chance to listen to ""And so it goes"" contained in this SACD at a high-end hi-fi show demonstration. It blew my mind on the spot and rushed me to order one. It turned out that ""And so it goes"" (a composition of Billy Joel) was the only tune that grabbed my heart. Other songs written by Jennifer Warnes were, simply put, boring to my taste. It only gave me a chance to reappreciate Billy Joel's strength as song writer, though he failed to make the song a hit himself. ""What a waste of money to pay extra bucks for this SACD,"" I found myself saying, but that's not so uncommon when buying records, so it goes."
3,Useful starter book,"An interesting , well presented book for the novice. It is frustrating however that the readability of this book in terms of measuring.. is only of value in the USA. A metric scale for those of us who have no idea what a pound is would be helpful"
3,Disappointing,"I have read around 6 of the Ackroyd-Thackeray series and, up until this one, have enjoyed them all. Perils of the Night was a slog and I should have given it up half-way through. I can only feel the writer was having an off-day or was carried away by the subject matter so that she got somewhat preachy and forgot about writing a good mystery. Still, everything else I have read by her has been terrific."
4,It is simple to read and understand.,I enjoy reading and learning about all types of yoga. This book is easy to follow and understand. It is also informative. Thanks.
1,Save Your $$$,"The first story is flat-out brilliant. I strongly suggest going to your local bookstore, reading it and walking out into the world with different eyes. But stop reading there, or you'll end up bitter with disappointment. The rest is repetitive write-by-numbers counterculture for the 21st century: derivative, tedious and overblown."
2,Hard for the short n chunky gals,"The petite plus claims to fit a 4'10""-5'4"" gal with a broad weight range of 155-210 pounds. Since I'm 5'1"" and 168, these should fit perfectly, right?Wrong.The control top part was ranging on the the dominatrix side of ""control."" There is NO way any woman closer to the 200 range is going to be comfortable whatsoever in these. Also, the ""petite"" aspect also wasn't all that successful either as I had plenty of fabric bunched at the crease of my thighs.You're 0-2 there, DKNY. The only saving graces are that they are closer to being accurate in size than the Spanx brand since they I will be able to wear them and the fabric is otherwise comfortable."
3,Catchy but could be better...,"Several of the songs on this CD are quite enjoyable, withcatchy hooks I find myself singing long after listening. The titletrack ""Marks of the Mission"", ""Holy One"", and""Left of Nowhere"" all have this effect. ""I Will SeeYou"" is the best of these, joyously anticipating the day allbelievers yearn for.Musically, the arrangements are somewhatconventional. Many of the songs have a dampened, predictable style.Some do break away, and they stand out: ""Freed"" is movingand meaningful, and ""Holy One"" and ""I Will SeeYou"" inspire praise. The rest, however, merely have the feel ofa talented performer doing just that -- performing."
4,Great for Bible School Students,"As a Bible student, I am required to read a book of the Bible two and three times before proceeding with a lesson. Now this can be quite tedious if, for instance I have only two months to read the entire Old Testament. So, I've come up with a for study: read the complete text first, then review the text using the Kwikscan Bible. It's been a great help. I would not recommend using this Bible for one's personal devotional time--God uses the whole Bible to speak to us--but for a quick review of a text for test or sermon preparation (as another reviewer stated) this Bible may come in handy. Apparently, the Kwikscan Bible is now out of print. I'd recommend purchasing a used copy if you can get your hands on one."
5,awesome produt,these came in the mail very quickly and exactly as stated. brand new in box with everything that I need. I cant wait to be able to put my motor together. i am very pleased working with amazon for all of my parts!
5,Thank you mr brust,"Out of all the other books in this series this one had to be the best i have read. Usually a brust book i move through fairly quickly, this one i savored. I enjoyed every bit of it. Thank you for starting and continuing such a interesting story in Vlad Taltos."
5,More To come,I have talked to Steven Brust recently and he has informed me he plans on a few more books after this one so keep looking for more to come.
4,Douglas and his experiences will stick in your mind...,"I listened to this book on tape. Once you can get past Douglas' ego the information he shares is valuable and important to everyone that interacts with strangers on any level. Read this book to become aware and somewhat street-wise of what can happen in the blink of an eye by almost anyone around you. I'm not the paranoid type, but this book sure made me glad I never let my son out of my sight as he grew up!"
4,"The inside look at the FBI, and the mentality of a killer","This is the first pleasure book I have picked up in quite some time. This is because I have been a full time student for the past 16 years. This book transitioned me from acedemic reading to pleasure reading. I found I just couldn't put it down. First of all, it is an autobiograophy, which I prefer. Secondly, it explore and somewhat explained the criminal mind, and who better to report than the FBI themselves. In general, if you liked ""Silence of the Lambs"" you will like this; (one of the characters from that movie is suppost to be a representation of John Douglas himself). It's not much of a holiday subject, but I am sending it to a friend of mine for Christmas cause I know she'll love it. I gave it only an eight b/c grammar was poor, writing was far from superior (but i think he didn't try to hide that, which I can respect) and transitions were weak, but as you can tell from above, who am I to talk.:)"
1,"Tired of Amazon passing off USED items as new when they are old, used, worn, or pass their sell-buy date.","Received ""Mindhunter"" hardback copy listed as ""brand new,"" but upon receipt found the spine cracked, and the pages at that point torn and separated from the spine. Not what I was looking for in a Christmas gift for my sister. Too late to replace it now. Needless to say I'm extremely disappointed in your product and won't be using your services again. Amazon is starting to go down hill lots. It is now like the new ebay it's getting that bad."
3,More Ego Than Info,When I began Mind Hunter I was expecting a lot more than I actually received. The book is interesting but it really lacks insight as to how the FBI actually arrived at their profiles. Most of the time a quick summary of the crime would be given then the author would describe the killer without ever explaining how he came to the conclusions he did. It left me with more questions then answers.
4,Not for the weak of heart,"Mindhunter is one of the most vivid and terrifying accounts of what evil lurks in the hearts and minds of people. Stories of vicious and sadistic killings, disturbing accounts of frail minds, endless sessions attempting to analyze and predict the killers' next steps and the successful captures and persecutions of several serial murderers are just a few of things one discovers while reading Mindhunter. The book has a fast paced tempo and readers soon become intimately involved in the search for justice for the victims. Not for the weak of heart."
3,Lots of apparent hocus-pocus without good science,"Although the meat of Douglas' material may be appealing, struggling through the self-serving ""I's"" ruins the punch. The arogant and condescending tone makes it difficult to find the useful information that I am sure is in there somewhere."
3,Very disappointing,"I had expected much more from this book after hearing some interviews with the author. The first one-third of the book dealt only with his personal life. I'm sorry, but that's not what I bought the book for. I did finally get an impression of what ""profiling"" was all about, but it was a struggle to sift this information out from the totally unrelated facts of his personal life. I feel like I was cheated out of my money!"
4,Loved it - very interesting,"Thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was extremely interesting, if a little unnerving at times, but always fascinating. There seem to be so many creepy people out there, but as the author says there needs to be more prevention of crime rather than detection after the event, although obviously this is not always easy or possible. Still a great book. I would highyl recommend i"
3,"More of a bio than ""inside the FBI's..""","John Douglas spends a lot of time talking about the cases and the workload, and his criss-crossing the country. I wish it went more into the details of each crime, spending a little more time on the details. I began Mind Hunter expecting a lot more than I received. The book is interesting but it really lacks insight as to how the FBI actually arrived at their profiles. Most of the time a quick summary of the crime would be given then the author would describe the killer without ever explaining how he came to the conclusions he did, and take credit for solving it. It left me with more questions then answers, and knowing a lot more about John Douglas than profiling. It's only 384 pages so its worth reading to the end, just know it's more about John Douglas the the ""inside"" story."
4,Mindhunter,"Fascinating insight into the development of profiling. Full of real case studies, it is hard to put down."
5,Profiling,"Great Book!!! Entertaining, well written kept me turning the page. Super informative and one of the best books I have ever read!!"
2,"Distracted and anecdotal, but interesting nonetheless","I was disappointed, sometimes confused, with the structure of this book, which attempts to involve us both in John Douglas's life and also examine general case studies. It attempts to reveal intricacies of Mr. Douglas's life, yet wasn't nearly as specific and detailed when discussing his interviews with serail killers or his specific case work. The authors would have done well to either focus on Mr. Douglas's human experience or describe profiling in detail. Instead, we get both in a series of interesting anecdotal crime stories peppered around Mr. Douglas's life story. It lacks both linear focus of case study and in-depth autobiography. This book will be of interest to those looking for an overview of profiling. The book attempts to cover all aspects of its subject, spread itself thin, and is therefore a hodgepodge rather than a tight, focused read."
3,The Man Is Not All Knowing,"While I admire the authors many accomplishments and can appreciate his contributions to the art of profiling, his ego leaves no room for admitting mistakes. This gives me reason for concern, no one is ever right in every instance no matter how experienced. For instance the William Heirens case which he breezes through with broad strokes doesn't touch on any of the contridictions of this particular case and in the end he writes William off as guilty without ever looking into any other aspects of the crimes and the man who supposedly committed them. I've come to know Mr. Heirens personally and quite frankly Mr. Douglas' treatment of his case was an insult. I was even more disturbed by Douglas' quick defense of Patsy Ramsey (for pay) when everything about Patsy's behavior fits his 'murderer' profile to a ""T"". I simply refuse to trust someone who believes they're incapable of being wrong."
2,All ego and little substance.,"What stands out most in this book is that the author has an ego that is bigger than the state of Texas. Some parts of the book are interesting, although it would be much better if Mr. Douglas could focus more on the functions of the Serial Crime Unit and less on his accomplishments."
2,Don't bother reading this book,"I believe this is my second John Douglas book and although I enjoyed the first one, this one was rather boring. I still haven't finished reading it. Douglas put too much of his own personal life in this book and as always he likes to praise himself , things I don't care for. He jumps around too much in this book and it sometimes get's confusing. If you like John Douglas don't buy this book."
2,Annoyingly Arrogant,"This book, is something of a journal in which John E. Douglas comes across as a testosterone-heavy policeman glorifying his career (and personal life) after the fact. It was interesting to read this book at the same time as Robert Ressler's ""Whoever Fights Monsters"" to compare the two. While both books contain similar information about the inner workings of the FBI and profiles of murderers, Ressler's ""objective"" accounts were refreshing compared to Douglas's continual self-aggrandizement. Through Ressler, we learn that many of the deeds for which Douglas claims credit were actually undertaken by Ressler while he was ""breaking in"" Douglas. Save yourself the annoyance, and read Ressler's book instead."
5,Excellent book,"I am the Director of Criminal Justice courses at Dodge City Community College, and I offer a course in criminology and offer a serial killer course. MindHunter is a required book for the criminology course. Douglas is able to explain psychological and criminological theories in a way that is easy for the average person to understand. Reading this book helps students apply the theories from the course to something they can understand. I receive positive feedback every semester from students who have really enjoyed reading the book.I met John Douglas a few years ago, and attended one of his seminars--his presentation on profiling was excellent!"
2,Meta Givens Modern Encyclopedia of Cooking 2 Volumes,"The problem is not with the books themselves, but the copies which were sent were in very poor condition, although the advertisement said they would be in good condition. Very disappointing!"
3,"Authentic Design, all you need to recreate Classic Arts and Crafts Projects","23 pages of ""how-to's"" and then detailed 2D and isometric drawings with dimensions and with cut lists. Cheap paper, no color, but clarity is very high because the plans are in drawing form rather than photos. Could have been improved with exploded diagrams of through-tenon joints, but Stickley's craftsmen didn't need that evidently. The projects are authentic, and work for woodworkers who don't want any style upgrades and only want the 1rst generation Arts and Crafts that the book represents."
1,Not happy,"Picture quality was absolutely terrible, almost appeared to be the last run of a multi copied pirate version from the Internet."
5,A peculiar glimpse into the relationship of two physicists,"Take a great mathematician, add to it the talent of a philosopher, the mindfulness of a Buddhist monk and the intuition of a gifted doctor and you get a world's greatest physicist. This book is a peculiar glimpse into the relationship of two accomplished physicists. The letters touch up on a number of scientific, humanitarian, and political issues. Enlightening account of two intelligent people dealing with the inevitable intellectual and personal differences within the context of their freindship. A fascinating account of Einstein's state of mind during his last days and his general attitude towards dying at the end of the book. The translations are done in questionable English but it only adds to the charms. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
5,Hard style to find.,This shoe runs a whole size to a size and a half too small. I ware between a 9 to a 9-1/2 in a D width. I ordered a size 9 and 10 only to find they were too small and I had to send them back. The size 10-1/2 fit perfect. Great looking shoe. Great quality.
4,Cool post-hardcore,"If you think that all hardcore sounds the same (which it doesn't) then you should try this album out. It is heavy, abrasive, uncompromising and unconventional. There are the occasional hints of melody buried within this madness, but the overall atmosphere is very dark and depressive (just check out the song titles) and this will put many off. This album takes quite a lot of perseverance, but if you are willing to give it time you will discover an excellent left-field hardcore album perfectly suited to a hate filled world."
4,We like the hardcore.,"""Rock And Roll Killing Machine"" brings to mind a blend of the melodic, yet extremely caustic screamo-emo sound of Planes Mistaken For Stars, and an equal dose of the schizoid, hate-filled math-core sound of Dillinger Escape Plan. While the musicians are quite skilled, versatile players, the highlight of ""Rock And Roll Killing Machine,"" is Simon Brody's vocals, which deviate from the all-out screaming devised by most modern hardcore bands, and tend to utilize more melody, which is usually a disaster in most hardcore, but works great here. Brody is a skilled lyricist as well, tossing out vivid, disturbing lines like ""We're in control, though losing blood through every hole."" While ""Rock And Roll Killing Machine"" does have it's shortcomings, (sitting through the entire thing, even at 28:39 long, is nothing short of exhausting) Drowningman will definately be band to watch over the course of their next few releases. Recommended."
5,La Crosse Technology WS-9611,"The weather station from La Crosse is very accurate and easy to read. It contains the date, time,an alarm clock, and has icons in the center that let you know if it is raining outside, sunny, etc. Settings are easy to use."
2,Hokie,The man seems hokie. All I really needed was an interior and exterior temperature and humidity measure. Sorry about this choice.
3,Great value for the money,Great product features for the money! I especially was looking for a unit that measured indoor humidity and had wireless outside temp. This unit met my needs.On the downside the backlight is a little dim and the outdoor wireless sensor required new batteries after a month of use. When replacing batteries on the outdoor unit you have to remove the batteries from the inside unit to get them to sync up. Then restore all of your local settings.
4,Great device,I like this product. Its easy to read and has been really accurate. Its fun watching the guy change clothes according to the weather.The reason I didn't give 5 stars is that I wish it came with better instructions.
2,Incorrect Remote Temp Reading,"I am dissatisfied with this product. The remote temperature reading is up to 4 degrees off (warmer) I also had a difficult time reaching their customer service. I tried via email and phone. Someone finally returned my call about a week later. After explaining my problem with their weather station, she said it was not unusual for the remote temp to be 2-4 degrees off. She said she would transfer me to the service dept but I was disconnected. I finally gave up and will probably return the weather station. All the other features work fine but what good is a thermometer if it does not give correct readings?Dissatisfied in Maryland"
2,Unfavorable,Product would not display outdoor temp. Did everything suggested in the manual with no success. Called LaCrosse three consecutive days without talking to a representative but able to leave name and number for a return call. Took LaCrosse another 4 days to return any call. By then item had been returned for a refund.
4,Wireless Weather Forecaster,"The outside readings would stop working on and off at times. This Wireless Weather Forecaster was a good value, I wish it would work all of the time."
2,"Looks like it has potential, but didn't work for me.","I recently purchased the La Crosse Technology Wireless Forecast Station. One of the reasons I decided to purchase this item was because it had several features I desired in a Wireless Forecast Station. It seemingly should have been a ""plug and play"" technology. However, after receiving the unit I took it out of the package and began to assemble it as directed. Assembly was easy (more or less it was just putting in the batteries). However, when I followed the instructions for set up I never could get the temperature gauge to read correctly. Unfortunately I will be returning this unit and attempting to find a different one that may work a little bit better out of the box."
4,"Pleased, but small.","The La Crosse WS-9611U is nice, but very small. The unit is only 4""X6"" and hard to see if your two far away. I ended up giving it to somebody."
3,problematic,"loved the idea of this. Today it showed the outside temp as 95, (a clear cloudless hot day), but the kid was wearing cold weather clothing with an umbrella. Hoped for what was promised, got an outdoor temp gauge."
2,"gave for xmas already broken, and cannot be repaired per the company","I bought this as a gift for my husband and it is now September and the device that goes outside is already broken, he called the company and they cannot send us just the unit to go outside we have to purchase a whole new unit. Terrible design with wireless device should be made to handle the elements because that is the only reason I can think of why it stopped working."
1,Dissatisfied coustomer,"Item did not work properly. After many delays finally given an RMA number. Warehouse draggged their feet in responding about status of item.More delays in sending replacement, on top of that sent to wrong address.Tried to change delivery address and told it cant be done )too close to delivery date) yet UPS has the means and ability to change delivery address.Overall a bad experiencs and question Amazon's ability to satisfy coustomer complaints."
1,DID NOT WORK,"Purchased this for a Christmas gift...will not show outside temperature. Followed instructions to the ""T."" Customer service IMPOSSIBLE to reach."
2,should have listened to the other reviewers,"Well this should teach me to believe it when I read the reviews and not take them with too much grain of salt.good stuffwell packageddisplay as describedit's cheapbad stuffthe antenna on my unit does not broadcast the temp.(this is probably busted but not worth the hassle of trying to get the unit replaced.)Instructions for setting up are not complete, the instructions for re-setting the connection have important information about distance between the units in it.there are buttons every where! cant touch the silly thing without hitting a button by accident.no reset button means you have to take the batteries out to attempt to reconnect or add a sensor. (I have done this over a dozen times this morning, but again I think mine is busted.) and if you touch any of the buttons you have to start over again.rest of my issues are covered in the other reviewers comments so no need to repeat.Next time I buy a better one and save the aggravation"
4,On the Go Weather Station,"La Crosse Technology WS-9611U Wireless Sun/Moon Weather Station with 15 Advanced Forecast IconsThis is a great mobile unit with its out side sensor, great for RVing, camping & boating, has acceptable range of transmission. So whats not to like. Easy to set up clear instructions. Four out of Five stars not perfect but what is!!!E. DeardorffPrineville OR."
3,Disappointed,"Our six-year-old twin grandsons enjoy checking the weather on our wireless forcast station so we thought it would be fun to get them one of their own with Oscar to show them how to dress for the day's weather. Our station measures 12""x 7"" and this one appeared similar in size, however when it arrived we were disappointed to find that it was much smaller - 3""x 5"". We will keep it because our grandsons will still enjoy it, but we are disappointed with the size. This would be a much better product if it were larger and you were better able to see Oscar from a distance."
4,Outdoor equipment,"This unit has a light weight and compact design which makes it easy to display almost anywhere. The digit display is noticeable up close and accurate in a moderate climate. Battery life is not known however the unit ships with the first set of batteries included. All in all, this is a nice novice weather reporter for the price."
1,wheater station ws -9611u-it-cbp,wheater station.ws-9611u-it . wheater man dus not change. always the same .Lost sales slip
1,Dead after two years,"Update: the unit died after two years of use. There is no display no matter what batteries I put in. I checked other reviews and found out I am not alone.The station works fine as advertised. The build quality is superb, and it feels good in your hand. One warning, though: the unit is quite small. If you don't have a perfect vision (like me) you would have to get close to the unit to see the numbers. I own WS-8117U-IT-OAK wall clock and just assumed that station wouldn't be too small, and didn't read closely the product dimensions. Other than that, I like the unit - and it's perfect for my kids."
2,A Sisappointment,"The news of the death of Beryl Bainbridge last year made me want to read books by a very accomplished writer. In our book club we chose to read Master Georgie.This was a great disappointment. We should have asked for advice on what books to read. The book was nominated for the Booker prize in 1998, but did not win the award.While there is an interesting historical episode as the background, and there were different viewpoints, the reader never feels that this is a book that must be read. At times it seemed disjointed. There were narratives from different characters, but that style did not feel the gaps. Different narratives normally means the reader gets an insight into an event from different perspectives. This did not happen.So need to read other books to appreciate the greatness of Beryl Bainbridge"
3,Thank god it was cheap,I had to get this movie for a project in a comp class. It is long..... I thought it would be funnier.
4,Great movie but...,We were very anxious to get this classic CG movie. but the movie was in black and white. not color as advertized.
3,Pre-Color Money Pit,"Although this movie starts out a bit dull (due to actors' lack of comedic timing or poor direction?), it winds up being pretty funny. Stereotypical by today's standards, it's hard to overlook the full-time maid and stay at home wife of a family who has financial challenges. The script and acting abilities, though, saved the film from total hopelessness."
2,Funny? Far from it!,"I bought this movie because of my girlfriend's recommendation. I told her that I loved the movie ""The Money Pit"" with Tom Hanks and she said I just had to get ""Mr. Blandings Dream House"". In all fairness, I did not finish seeing the movie to the end but came within a half hour of seeing the entire movie. Why? Because it was that bad...not even a chuckle. Even if the last half hour was rip roaring hilarious which I highly doubt, it would not be worth seeing. I love Cary Grant but this movie did not do him justice. The quality of the movie was excellent but who cares if the movie stinks. I don't know why other reviewers are giving it such high marks. I may be missing something but I'm not going to waste another 2 hours to find out what it was. Stick with ""The Money Pit"". It's the REAL ""Dream House""."
5,great movie excellent price,It makes me happy to see old movies and when I get them for such a great price it feels even better. Thank you
5,Lived it,"Every time I watch this move, I think about the BS my wife and I went through building our house. The only difference is that we build 90% of our house with our own hands. We had floods like they did, we had no money like they did, as I said we lived this movie and can related to the average slob fighting the system."
3,Snapshot of Life at a Research Facility in the 1920's,"This book was written by the wife of a marine biologist working at a research facility at Woods Hole, an island in Massachusetts. Told from the point of view of a young college student acting as nanny to the daughter of one of the researchers, it paints a picture of the scientific community there and the discoveries being made in the 1920's. Unfortunately, the college-aged protagonist is boring and the social conventions will be confusing to younger readers. The scene where the scientist's wife gives a tea is so dated it's painful to read.While I wouldn't recommend it for young children history buffs will enjoy the book's authentic flavor and the detailed description of life at a a research facility in the 1920's."
2,Not happy with the set,"The picture shown on the package is not on the sheet set. It is the picture that is on the comforter. Because it was on the package, I assumed it would be on the sheets. The picture is of figures wielding lightsabers. Only the pillow case had this.I was very dissappointed as this was a gift for a grandchild.Sandra LaPorte"
1,Cheap Sheets,"I read the reviews, but purchased these sheets anyways. I needed Star Wars sheets for my sons bedroom and nothing else is available. Not sure what the thread count is, but it must be the absolute lowest. It's too bad that sheets with a higher thread count aren't available. I'm sure that I'm not the only person who wants her child to be comfortable."
1,Waste of money,This was a present for my husband for Christmas. He set it up on Boxing Day and a week later it stopped working. He has had rain gauges before and knows how they work. This was a dud. And the return by date has expired (I bought it in November) so it seems I cannot get my money back or a replacement from Amazon. I am very disappointed.
2,20 Bucks for 20 Weeks,"Over a period of time, my wife has always demanded that she be able to measure rainfall. Each and every time, my transmitter unit will fail in 20-30 weeks. I guess this unit can't simply tollerate the South Carolina hot sun. My THIRD LaCross transmitter has now failed. I GIVE UP ON THIS PRODUCT..!"
4,Good Rain Gauge,"I bought this gauge about 9 months ago. It is mounted about 60 feet from the receiver and it picks up the signal through window glass and around a small obstruction. I've compared the gauge readings with the television weather report and they often match within 0.1"", so mine is very accurate.Pro: The gauge is continuous and doesn't require dumping water. You don't get wet reading the rainfall. It seems to be very accurate and reads in the hundredths of an inch.Cons: The three year battery life reported by Lacrosse is a joke; it's about 9 months for the transmitter. also, when you replace one set of batteries in the transmitter, you need to remove the batteries in the receiver to reset the signal; I had to do it a couple of times to work."
1,"Thin, weak plastic and poor design causes batteries to lose contact","The batteries for the outdoor part of the rain gauge are in a plastic box with a long, somewhat rectangular lid that holds on by two small clips, arranged at the very ends. If only they had used more than two clips or put them on the long edges rather than the small ones, it might have worked. But as it is, the lid bends because the first, positive-side-up battery pushes it out too far to meet the negative-side-up battery right beside it. You can solve this with a bit of tape at the contact or tape to hold the lid down (or both). But it really couldn't have been much more idiotic considering how simple this device is. I kept it because I don't know where I put it's box, but I wouldn't buy it again; a plain old rain gauge works just as well for me really."
2,Agree about the buttons...,"This phone has been good for me for several years, and it is certainly less ugly than most phones seem to be these days, but the buttons have started to go on mine, and I am about to ditch it for something better. Either they are totally impossible to press or they press twice, making it extremely difficult to dial or even answer this phone. Really, it's an unacceptable situation, and AT&T should be ashamed about this."
5,Happy to have this....,I had a Rowenta and it never worked like this one. I like quilting which requires a lot of ironing with good steam. This iron has great steam. So far I am very happy with it.
4,"Great iron, but NOT for lefties","This is the best iron my husband has ever owned according to him. It heats well, uses steam well, overall a great product. Luckily, he is the one who does most of the ironing in our home. I am left handed and it is absolutely annoying for me to use. The cord comes out on one side and can't be adjusted. It always gets in my way either when ironing or when trying to set it down upright. My husband (a righty) says no wonder it never gets in his way. I agree that it is a great iron, works well, no complaints (no leaking like others have mentioned). The retractable cord is also great. If the cord could be switched from one side to the other, it would get 5 stars. A great iron for right-handed people!"
2,Bad design,"I am surprised this item has 4.5 rating1) Major design flaw: indicator light is lit only when iron is warming up. After it reached desired temperature it turns off. So there is no way to tell if iron is off or warmed up to desired temperature2) Indicator light is obscured by the handle and is not easily visible.3) Iron tips over very easily (possibly due to having a cord storage reel)4) [Not 100% sure about this one, haven't tested enough] Seems like when iron is shut down after time out indicator stays off and there is no indication that iron is plugged in.Here is how indicator works on my old iron (and should work on any iron IMO): it is not lit only when iron is unplugged. When iron is warming up indicator is orange. When temperature is reached it becomes red. After auto-shutdown (due to time-out or tip-over) indicator blinks red until it is unplugged or righted.That being said iron performs well but these design flaws make it dangerous. I returned it."
5,Works great for me,"I needed a simple iron that i could use to iron my polo shirts and khakis the night before work. The cord keeper is a very nice feature. It doesn't snap the cord in right away, but after a couple of pushes it take the cord in slowly. Which is probably safer than it going in too quickly. It glides just right and i am very satisified so far."
2,Not a Rowenta Replacement,"My 8 yr old Rowenta malfunctioned, overheating and scorching a shirt (as well as the board cover beneath) within 3 seconds of touching the fabric even while the iron was moving. So I went for this popular Panasonic model. In short, on the ""silk"" setting, the temperature of the soleplate varied tremendously, cooling to the point where I could comfortably place my hand on the soleplate before the thermostat finally kicked in to reheat. I could tell when the plate was cooling when the steam generation stopped and wrinkles didn't disappear. Even on the ""linen"" setting, when the iron was hottest, wrinkles in linen didn't disappear, even with the the steam burst. I had to ""spray"" the wrinkles, but the spray is a thin stream which just saturates the fabric in a thin line. IMHO, the detachable tank and retractable cord features are just gimmicks."
4,"I like it, would buy again","I have been using it for last 8 monthsI really like itpros1-The detachable water tank is very convenient.2-The Soleplate is very good quality(was very easy to clean after it was dropped on the carpet and got lot of burn deposit, was able to clean it off easily)3-The steam is fast4-Auto shut off is very comfortablecons1-Difficult to empty the tank2-If there is water left in the tank the next time its used it gives trouble for first few minutes3-The retractable cord does not work very well, you have to try a few times before it retracts fullyBut since all the cons are not effecting too much the main purpose of iron, i would say its really good"
3,Buy a Rowenta Instead,"My wife could iron for a living. She irons at least a dozen shirts and skirts a week. She has used both Rowenta and Braun over the past several years, which heat up quickly and give lots of steam. She was not happy with how much steam comes out of this iron. I do not like the detachable water compartment as another moving part is something else that can break on the iron. The cord retrieval assembly at the base keeps it very neat."
4,Makes ironing easy,"After years of using a Black and Decker iron that spewed water all over the laundry room and ironing table I decided it was time to replace it. I am quite satisfied with the Panasonic NI-C78SR. It heats up fast, irons well and sits nicely for storage. The only thing not completely great is the automatic cord storage, which doesn't always roll up the cord completely. Otherwise I am completely happy with it."
5,I love this iron!!!!,I love this iron. It is so easy to fill and empty the water out of it. There is plenty of steam and this iron is not too heavy. And did I mention the storage of the cord. I probably like that feature best of all. I would recommend this iron. Good value for the price.
2,TOO MUCH TIME AND EFFORT WASTED,"I already have a full time job and I don't want it to be spending 15 minutes ironing a shirt. The steam power is ok. The most annoying aspect of the iron is charging the cordless iron DURING ironing. You have to constantly put it back in the base to charge every 3 minutes. This is such a time waster. On a positive note, it comes with a case to easily put away, which I have a feeling will be useful as I dread using this iron so it'll have a nice cozy stay in the closet. I will whip out my rusty old Rowena."
2,You get what you pay for,"quality is so-so. tried to iron a few cotton dress shirts and they were semi-wrinkled afterwards. summer pants made of linen (a super thin fabric) were also wrinkled after ironing + using steam with this little guy. i followed the ironing instructions to the letter!also, the hide-away cord design is a great idea but poorly executed in this model. plastic is flimsy and i have a feeling that the place where the cord rolls into is going to break any minute. also - heat settings are printed awkwardly at the bottom of the iron.for all the great reviews, it's not a great iron :("
4,Pleasantly surprised,"After about a month, I'm quite satisfied with this iron. My last few have been very expensive units that ultimately get knocked off the ironing board.My wife really wanted an iron with a retractable cord, and I wanted something a bit more cost effective.The switch from ceramic soleplate to steel wasn't too bad. At first, it did not glide as well, but that improved and I now find it satisfactory.The removable water tank is actually a pretty nice feature, and feels more solid than I expected. My only concern is that the water fill cover is going to break off before long.So far so good, though..."
1,Disappointed after reading reviews posted,"Purchased iron from Amazon in July and steam feature gave out by November. I treated iron well, did not drop, used distilled water since our water is very hard per instructions etc. I would not buy this iron."
4,manageable steam iron that doesn't leak!!!,"Light enough to be used without pain, retractable cord a plus. DOESN'T LEAK OR SPURT WHEN NOT NEEDED!No negatives"
4,The Pill has been swallowed,"I think Mr. Seay and Mr. Garrett have done in outstanding job in their communicating the spiritual connection between the Matrix and the world we live in. I believe John Calvin said ""All truth is God's truth, all beauty is God's beauty"". This book helps us to see the truth and beauty in film. It helps us to understand our own spirituality in a way that many of us are not accustomed to, especially from the Christian perspective. I highly reccommend this book not only to better understand the movie, but to get a better grasp on your spirituality."
5,"Unbelievable, it is a great read for any Matrix Fan","When I first saw The Matrix I was blown away and this book is the perfect companion to the films. Seay and Garrett pack the book with information about the varied symbols and influences in these films such as anime, greek mythology, postmodern philosophy, gnosticism, budhism, comics, and of course Christianity. The discussion of both films make it the only book out that is current and timely. I am buying more for gifts."
2,"Misleading, on the whole","A quote from page 126: ""A good steak dinner laced with strychnine is farm more dangerous than a clearly marked bottle, especially if you are hungry.""Anyone hoping this book will help them understand homeschooling should know that it is a pro-spanking, fundamentalist Christian tome and not even clearly Biblical. ""Pain does teach!"" and ""Spanking is not hitting"" take it outside the field of homeschooling, and perhaps Amazon should re-categorize it."
2,moderate indie OG flick,"Not in the same quality of plot, production, character development of Boys n the Hood or menace 2 society. Not even in the same quality of ""in too deep"" or or ""Belly"". But if you like this genre and can sit through minimal plot, moderate acting then this movie is for you."
2,Hot Falling Plaque And Dripping Glue...,"We purchased two of the black 10 piece model (cast iron) of this fondue set for a party we were having. Although it did the job fine be warned that the ""fondue"" brass plaque that is featured on the side is glued on. Once the pot is heated the glue melts making the hot plaque fall off onto the table, then the melted glue will continue dripping down the side of the pot into the flame permeating the air with a burnt chemical smell. It is obvious that this product was not tested before going to market but on the bright side, the plaque is (in my opinion) ugly so the fondue pot looks better without it. FYI: After the pot cooled down I managed to get the remaining glue off by using a blow torch to heat up the glue then wiping it off with an old rag."
5,The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,"This is a brilliant movie...and deserved the awards it received. Although it is despairing at one level, it is inspiring on a deep level."
5,Worth watching,One of the most beautiful and astonishing films I've ever seen. Jean-Dominique Bauby is a hero in that his persistence resulted in a book about the reality of locked-in syndrome. This film is quite uncomfortable in that you get to witness firsthand through his eyes the confusion and frustration he felt when others made decisions for him and he couldn't voice his opinions and feelings. This film will remain in my mind for a long time.
3,Sticky buttons in Big Button Telephone,"As anyone who reads my reviews will know, I like to praise products I buy from Amazon. It is rare indeed for any product to fall short of my expectations. In this case, I bought the Big Button telephone to mount on the wall next to my desk. It turned out that the telephone has been sitting on a shelf in storage too long. The four button stuck. I disassembled the unit, and fixed the button to some extent, but the stick-up plastic stub designed to hold the receiver when the phone is wall mounted did not hold in the up position. I ended up not using the phone."
5,Meredith's secret,Great Book--It kept me reading until I was finished(strange twist at end made it worth missing a night of sleep)!!When is the next book out!!
4,plenty of jokes,quite a few good jokes. some adult humor that i did not care for but overall a good buy
1,Dont waste your money,How come I don't see anyone without a job? Dont waste your money buying this useless book. Watch a movie in the theaters instead.
4,This game plays on xp!!,"Talk about a gem ... Ive been playing this game almost solid for two weeks..I'm giving it only a 4 overall cause its old and the video clips are kind of dated but this game rocks..you fly around buying and selling cargo and dodging these creeps trying to space you. the physics of the space combat are great and you dont have to have a joy stick.. easy to fly with a mouse! great ship upgrades and tons of ships to choose from.. of course you start out with only 13000 space units to spend so you need to earn some cash delivering cargo bounty hunting or picking up spaced cargo.. look for missions on the bulletin board at any space port.. you can hire freighters as well and wingmen if you like..Ohh!, and you get to find out who you really are... Lev Aris. You will need dosbox(google dosbox) to play this one and there are instructions for mounting the game on dosbox at Wing Commander CIC(google it). If you like space flyers you will kick yourself for passing this one up!"
5,"If you're in E-business, you NEED this book!","Outstanding coverage of E-privacy from the political end as well as the technical end. With the renewed emphasis on personal liberties and personal privacy, this friendly and easy-to-read guide will help everyone who runs an E-business to mind their customers privacy or risk it all in the justice courts of in the courts of consumer preferences. Do yourself a favor and buy this book NOW!"
1,Astoundingly Boring,"I liked some of Fripp's other sound loop projects, but this was so boring I couldn't stand it. Better to get one of those ambient sound records of wave crashing on the beach. At least there is some rhythmic component to that. New age music at its worst."
4,Rosalia De Souza - Garota Moderna,"The handiwork of Nicola Conte is all over Rosalia De Souza's debut album, Garota Moderna. There are plenty of Italian jazz flourishes over the tracks, sprinkled on generously like freshly grated Parmesan cheese over a steaming bowl of pasta. De Souza's voice is light and gentle, perfectly suited to the quick and easygoing rhythms that Conte lays down for her. A few tracks, like ""Saudosismo,"" go for a more relaxed attitude, rather than for a samba. A little more than half the tracks are remakes, but Conte shows that he's comfortable arranging others' tracks for maximum enjoyment. Garota Moderna is irrepressibly sunny, from ""Bossa 31"" to the beach-ready ""Ipanema."" Plenty to enjoy here!"
4,AT LAST A REAL BAND OF THE NEW MILLENIUM,"The DAMAGE MANUAL came out with a mediocure EP entitled ONE a few monthes ago, but I was very impressed with their debue full length album. This band is basically an all-star industrial mega-group. Chris Connely (revolting cocks) on vocals, Martin Atkins (PIL, Pigface) on electronics, Jah Wobble (Killing Joke)on drums, and the fantastic guitarist also from Killing Joke, I forget his name....Any how, Atkins is the all reining master of gritty-techno electronics with Connely's David Bowie like voice to top it all off. This album has unique remixes of Sunset Gun, Blame and Demand, and Damage Addict which 1st appeared on the EP. This is a must by for any serious music fan, these guys aren't no TRL sell-outs, THIS IS THE REAL THING !!!!!"
1,Big Disappointment,"I was anxious to see this B movie mainly because of the stars and the great supporting cast of character actors. Do not buy it. The quality is zero. I could cope with only five minutes of it and discarded it. Since purchasing this, I have found the same movie complete online. The quality there is not all that good but is a lot better than this inferior copy."
2,my dog wont use it,I bought bothe the purple one and a sky blue one. My dogs don't like either. I thought they were going to be fluffy and deep but these dog beds are more like kennel mats. I wouldnt buy them again.
3,Should be called crate pad,Once I received this bed I noticed it to be smaller than pictured.The outer ring is fluffy but inside part is thin. I think it works best as a kennel or crate pad rather than a bed.
3,smaller than size chart,"I ordered the pink 24 X 18, and the bag said it was that size. I measured and it was actually the smaller bed mislabeled. Looks well made and pretty soft material. I'm not using this for a crate, but to give my small Papillon a place of her own in my bed at night. Her buddy that she slept in a big dog bed with died this week. She had to move into my bed as she is grieving, so am I. This has no padding except the rolled edge, which is fine and will keep her in one spot and let her know her boundary. I read one other reviewer that said they also ordered the pink and the size was not what she ordered. Be aware of this problem with the pink one being sold as a larger size than it is. If you are looking for padding for a crate you will need to add some foam under it as it is very flat and thin except the rolled edge."
5,The Best forever!,"Although I am a 59 year old man, nevertheless, I, for a strange reason, love reading children books. The first time, I read this book I was a college student and working in the university's library. One day, I saw a book laying down on a desk, grabbed it and read the first or two pages, by the time I put back the book down on the desk, I found myself spend 4 hours and missed my chemistry class!!I tried to find and buy this book for many years but it was out of print. Until few months ago, I found it in Amazon. I love Barbara Wersba writing style, She is the best and my favorite writer. I strongly recommend this book."
1,A Misfit Copy,"of The Fast & The Furious movie and only 20% of the movie time contains racing, Simply the movie is an advertise for a Misfit car called 2005 GTO (a.k.a Holden Monaro desgined and produced in Australia) also released as 2003 Chevrolet Lumina SS Copue in the Middle East (I bought one before & sold it after one week only), This car simply not Pontiac or Chevrolet it's Holden and you can find alot of them in the streets because of it's cheap price as a sports car.for more info. check: www.holden.com.au / www.chevroletarabia.com"
5,Awesome!!!,The final part of the trilogy and it's freaking awesome!!! I've followed Herculine since she was but a girl and now she's all grown up...
2,strange film that ultimately falls flat,"I really don't get all the positive reviews on this movie; it simply wasn't that good. Basically, it is an extemely bizarre and violent film which attempts to blend extreme horror with dark comedy, but ultimately fails in both areas. Movies this strange are sure to gain some cult notoriety, but with all the five star reviews I expected so much better.If you are really looking for something strange, pick up All night Long instead. It succeeds in every area where this one fails."
3,"Two boys' review: Great design, but not very durable Batman villain","This Clayface design comes from ""The Batman"", the animated show on the WB.My sons loved the design but this action figure wasn't durable enough to withstand their gameplay. I'm still looking for a stronger action figure to replace this one, which only lasted about four months before the arms were pulled out of the sockets."
3,little surprised,I wanted to see Everlast in movies. Judgement Night stays as the classic. Peter Greene is no doubt good at what he does.
2,Milquetoast,"For the most part the writing was descriptive and engaging. However, the word ""brilliant"" became a nuisance, like a pimple on the end of another's nose, so that every time it showed up it became more irritating. My real beef was that the story line was nothing more than a modified, modern version of Jane Eyre without conviction."
3,My son loved it!,My son selected the Bionicle Vakama and was very pleased with his purchase. He loves to mix & match pieces from the Bionicles to create his own after he's built the original model.
5,Autumn In New York,"Michael by Michael Kors is a rich elegant and utterly sophisticated scent for any gentleman of discerning style and taste. Hiting notes of leather, tobacco, and plum it has the feel of tony aristocratic mahogany panneled New York men's clubs, or a brisk walk to the boathouse in Cental Park in the golden glow of a late afternoon in Autumn. Certianly not for everyone, least of all a kid, this is strictly for a man who just who he is and where he is going."
1,A distressingly biased book,"This book distorts history by omitting crucial information. In its first two pages it gives an overview of the Arab-Israeli conflict without mentioning either a) the decision by the UN to divide mandatory Palestine into two states, b) the acceptance by the Jews and the rejection by the Arabs of this decision, c) the invasion of Israel by the armies of five Arab countries, d) the expulsion from Arab countries of hundreds of thousands of Jews, or e) the occupation of the lands designated for the Palestinian state by Egypt and Jordan.Without these facts, it is impossible to understand the subsequent history.This book carefully selects its facts to paint Israel as the aggressor and the Palestinians as the blameless oppressed people.It does not belong in the classroom."
3,Too much Talking,My 4 and 9 year olds love Monster trucks but they weren't crazy about this DVD. Less talking more action is needed.
5,This work out will kick your butt!!!,If you are not serious about exercing then this product is not for you. This work out is one of the best work out ever put out there and the name says all SHAPE IT UP!!. If you wnat to shape your figure and love yourself when you look in the mirror then you better be ready to work it ..
1,Quality Control is an issue,"I took a leap of faith with this product even though some of the reviews I read were not good. This product looks great! However, one of the channels did not work. It cost me $61 to ship it back and 2 weeks to get a refund."
1,poor product,I got this as a gift... first system was faulty and was sent for a return. The second system lasted 2 months and is now dead. I have not been sucessful in getting any assistance from parent company.
3,eh,"There were only three songs that I loved, (two of them are on the radio). There were a few I could stand, and I couple I had to skip when they came on. I was expecting more dance-style/hip-hop, however I was disapointed with most of the songs, as they didn't excite me as much as I antiscipated."
4,JUSTIN BANG!!!!!,"i luv this album!!!!!!!! my fav. songs are lovestoned, until the end of time and much more!! BUY THIS ALBUM RIGHT NOW!!"
3,Justin Gets in Touch with His Inner Prince,"Justin Timberlake should give any award that he wins for this album 50% credit to producre Timbaland. Their collaboration has made a surprisingly enjoyable album that makes you forget Justin was ever in that boy band. My favorite tracks are ""My Love"" and the last 4 tracks. The middle of the CD is forgettable in my opinion. Some of the tracks reminds of the Prince/Detroit sound from back in the day."
2,B-O-R-I-N-G,"I read a few reviews from music critics comparing this to ""The Gloved One"" in his prime. Needless to say, I had high hopes for JT's sophomore effort. Unfortunately with the exception of the title track and the infectious groove of the radio hit ""Sexy Back"", this CD had me looking for the nearest recliner rather than my dancin' shoes. One tired track after another and I suddenly found myself looking forward to the end of the disc. Justin is a very talented guy and the vocals are impressive on a couple of tracks to be sure, but whatever talent he has seems wasted on this snooze-fest. I give it 2 stars and a bunch of zzzzzzzz's."
5,amazing album!,"for the birthday girl who was disappointed, this is how you spell repetitive..also given that you're 30 something, i would have assumed that you were listening and lovin' the music during the 80's. that's the era justin based this album on..sorry you found it a ""total disappointment.""Anyway, this album totally rocks! if you're from LA area KIIS FM actually played the whole album some days ago before the album was released and Valentine gave little tidbits about what each song being played was about. for example-Losing My Way was written after Justin watched a documentary on a man whose life was completely destroyed by his abuse of crystal meth. also, the last song,the ballad is exactly how he sang it, it's the first cut or something. Justin really went out on a limb with this album and his collaborations are amazing. i 100% recommend this album!!!!!"
5,Not what i expected but love it,Got this album a couple of days ago and can't stop playing it. This album is nothing like justified but is just as good if not even better.
4,His Best CD To Date,"I have to admit after hearing Sexyback I didn't think much of Justin's new CD but then I heard ""My Love"" then ""What goes Around"", hearing them made me want to hear the rest of the songs. The song (Another Song) All over again puts me back in the 70's when they really new how to make songs. And that is saying a lot. Losing My Way is a great song about drug abuse.A well rounded CD. Good job Justin transformed from Boy to Man.L"
5,Awesome CD!,"I was not a huge fan of hip hop or Justin Timberlake in the past, but this CD is awesome! It has some great dance tunes as well as ballads. I highly recommend it!"
1,"You can dance, but he can't sing","This cd has only a few songs that have a good dance beat. Seems that it's one of rip off deals where the single was pushed because it's one of the few good songs. But, I'm sorry, you can dance to these few upbeat songs, but Justin just can not sing. The vocals are horrible. Bottom line, you'd be better off to just buy the single. The rest of cd is just okay, and if you like good vocals, don't bother at all."
5,great,"i love this cd. i think that this cd is the best cd ever, this is the best work from him yet.i like the last three songs and what goes around come around. you have to buy the cd, it is great. go justin go. i can not way until the tour in jan."
5,AMAZING!,"Soo, I didn't really know what to expect from this album. I had a $5 credit from Amazon since I bought textbooks.I decided to use it on this album on a whim. It didn't disappoint. I'm loving the songs and I love that fact that they aren't ""NSYNC-ish""He has definitely developed himself into a solo artist and I applaud him for that.I would recommend this album 100%. It's fun. It's catchy. It's a definite mood lifter. :)"
1,My Birthday gift sucked!,"So all I wanted was this CD for my b-day (Sept. 12th). My husband went to every music store in Houston and finally found a copy.I guess Thirty ""something"" year old's are just not meant to listen to Justin. I loved his first album and all my friend's ribbed me about it, and said I needed to listen to their stuff that had much more substance. Well, now I see why. I flicked through every song, some with robot sounding ""Justin"" voices & songs that just had repetitive lyrics. I don't see the talent in this album y'all are talking about. Sorry!WHAT A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT!"
2,Should be bringing Pharrell back...not sexy.,Pre-ordered this on the strength of Pharrell's production last album (not on the weak effort by Sexyback) only to find that Timbaland is the exclusive producer on this album which is unfortunate due to his latest fasicination with an overproduced 'degraded electro' R&B sound. Just like Nelly Furtado's new record only Justin singing. I incorrectly assumed that Pharrell and Timbaland would again be sharing production credits. Oh well...for an artist like Justin he's going to be as good or as bad as the person producing the tracks. Unfortunately for him Timbaland is definitely in a slump creatively at the moment (past 2 years). The tracks and the vocals just don't function as one cohesive solid production. Justin...you need to bring Pharrell back...not your sexy
1,JUSTIN TIMBERFLAKE........,"To think you played your best music as a BACKSTREET BOY has to be a sad &depressing experience...Oh, well...at least we know you're NOT a lesbian in spite of recentlypublished photos...All those who are are so thankful..."
1,Garbage incarnate,"I can't believe anyone would take this junk seriously. The 'music' is so inept, clueless & boring it's inconceivable that anyone with an IQ over 5 would like this. This goes to show you the power of marketing & how true it is that there's a sucker born every minute. This guy 'sexy' ? He looks & sounds like a brain damaged troll. I've seen better looking poo.I give it -10 stars."
1,blue,"The only song I like on here is the one when he writes about the man and his life passing him by. I feel like Sexy back is not Justin at all. I feel like it should have a warning label saying this is computers, not justin. I found it annoying to hear all these preludes. You have to fast foward through them to get to the songs. Very annoying."
3,we-ell,"I don't even like justin as a person at all and think he's overrated in terms of looks and all that but I have to admit this CD was really well done. I loved the beats on here, timbaland really delivered this time. Some of the beats resemble brandy, aaliyah, ginuwine, michael jackson, prince, usher, george michael and aaliyah's work. Those are some of the artists I was reminded of when listening to this CD. Does justin get too much credit? YES! But is this CD bad? Not at all, I think it's one of the best to have come out this year, but janet jackson's 20 yo CD is also awesome. If you want simple r&b/dance music that you can chill too and dance too without being overproduced, janet is a great choice and if you want r&b music with more of a hip hop and pop flavour this CD is good. Forget the past, both have made good albums this year and have really delivered!"
2,Not sure what I expected...,"Justin Timberlake and I are no longer ""on the same page."" I liked SexyBack, but I should have downloaded the song, instead of buying the whole album."
2,Not impressed,"Each song sounds the same. Quite boring except for Sexy Back. Thought it was going to be a little more upbeat and fun to workout to, but I was wrong. Boring......"
5,"Stop Hatin, This Album is FIYYAAAAHHH","Wow, where can I begin but with the first song to the last, this album is the best album of 2006. As another reviewer said, YOU HAVE TO LIKE R&B and EURO Pop to like this album. Appreciate good work ya'll. Stop hatin! ""Oh, it doesn't sound like Nsync, all the song are the same, blah blah,"" HELLO! The songs are supposed to be about the same thing, that's why albums have titles to sum up the the entire feel of the album (DUH). I think Timbaland has found his new ""Aaliyah"", and I'm happy about it. She will forever be missed, but at least we can expect to continue to hear straight FIYAH from Timbaland & Timberlake in the future! And I'm out (dancing off to sexyback)"
1,????,"I believe in Justin's talent, but I think ""Justified"" has alot more solidity in terms of the sound and it was a pleasure to listen to.This is the same song played over and over again, with too much of a harsh electronic sound overall. I really dislike it.I agree with one viewer who gave it a bunch of zzzzzz's. He could have knocked our socks off but hasn't."
4,Lie Down with Lions,Not as good as Mr Follet's most recent books - but a good read non the less. At least I didn't want to put it down when I started it - a good sign then?
1,A silly romance novel,"Girls who are sophomores in high school might like this book, but I had to give it up after a couple of chapters. Just plain silly. Shallow and giggly. I have been fooled into buying this author's books before, but never again."
3,great entertaining thriller romance,Gave insight to the Russian/Afghanastan war era. Also was an thrilling and entertaining romantic novel. Didn't keep my interest as other of his novels usually do.
2,A very disappointing set,"Based on the other reviews and descriptions, I was very eager to receive this set and then very disappointed when I did. Everything is very nice quality, but the deck (far from being ""beautiful"") is quite ugly. The colors are muted and dull. The pictures are juvenile and creepy in a sort of silly way. The book has a lot of interesting information in it but is a tremendous departure from any tradition with which I am familiar. I may keep the book as an off-beat reference, but I will definitely divest myself of the cards. I don't like looking at them or handling them, and I would find them very difficult to read since the pictures and descriptions do not coincide with any other information on card reading (tarot or playing card) that I have encountered. If I saw this set in a store, I would not buy it."
3,Another filler 2nd novel,"I really adored the 1st novel The Smoke Thief because of it's unique shape-changing hero and heroine and the dynamic storyline. I was not too keen on this 2nd novel not only because the characters were not as vivid, but also because I'm tired of the Carpathian Mountains. I guess I will re-read this book when I am not too influenced by my annoyance with Feehan's Carpathians, which I think influenced my opinion of this book, so for now the first reading garners a 3 stars."
5,Undead & Unreturnable,Ms Davidson thank you for keeping me up till late hours of the night. I have enjoyed each and everyone of your Undead books. I can't wait to read the new one.
3,"Fun, light-hearted romp","As with many 'funny-book' writers its possible that Davidson has run out of steam. After a slow beginning with a number of over-the-top characters, I found myself really enjoying the silly adventures of Betsy, her lover Sinclair and the host of kooky characters which haunt...er... Live in her mansion.While I enjoyed the story, part of me wonders what might happen if Davidson chose to write a non-humorous book. Her vampires are interesting and funny, but there's only so much the valley-girl jokes one can stand. This book reminds me a bit of the Stephanie Plum books...Silly, light-hearted froth not to be taken seriously.Unlike other readers, I was glad this audibook was short. I'm not sure how much more froth from the air-headed superficial heroine I could stand. 3.5 stars."
2,Only a Partial Manual,"This book consists of only Sections I and II of the SR-71 ""Dash One"", which contain the equipment descriptions and normal procedures. The sections containing information such as emergency procedures, flight characteristics, crew duties, and aircraft performance data are all missing. This unclassified information is available in online versions of the manual, therefore this book has to be rated as a big disappointment."
2,"The Real Deal, but .....","This is the real deal, but regrettably it's a scan of a poor quality printed copy (perhaps exactly as it was declassified). Some of the diagrams and illustrations are completely unreadable thus extremely disappointing. Reading the 'ragged' body text is also tiring on the eyes. For the price, I was hoping for a higher quality rendering."
1,3+stars you got to be kidding,sorry folks but this was Asprin's worst work to date. He came off a long hiatis and wrote what appeared to me to be woman hating drivel. Im left asking what happened? and if that wasn't bad enough he went back on hiatis right after publishing this one. well one can only hope that the next one will redeem him.
2,Marilyn from Calif.,I wasn't expecting alot for the price. But I was really disappointed in my pearls. Every pearl had a very noticeable flaw on it.
3,Seasons Comeback,"After Frankie Valli scored a number one hit in early 1975 with ""My Eyes Adored You"" and followed that up with a top ten hit ""Swearin' To God"", the Four Seasons regrouped later in the year. The album produced their biggest hit, the radio classic ""December, 1963 (Oh What A Night)"" that went to number one in early 1976. Also hitting the top ten, peaking at number three, was the title track that while not as popular as the former, it is the best track on the album. Tight harmonies and trading of vocals from Mr. Valli & Bob Gaudio make for a great single. ""Silver Star"" was a minor hit and has a old west theme while ""Harmony Perfect Harmony"" is pretty song that harkens back to their salad days."
4,1975 Sees The Four Seasons Recording First Disco Album.,"From 1962 onwards The Four Seasons battled it out with The Beatles The Rolling Stones and The Beach Boys for the top band in the US, until The Byrds, The Doors and others joined in.As a collection of their career from 1962 - 1978 The Very Best Of Frankie Valli And The Four Seasons Jersey's Best should be bought, it contains nearly all their best material.In the mid 1970s the Bee Gees released Jive Talking and The Four Seasons decided disco was the way to go.From this album Who Loves You and December 1963 (Oh What A Night) are included on the above Very Best Of and they are excellent disco numbers.The remainder of this albums tracks cannot be easily found elsewhere and Silver Star is a standout for me, although it is very different from their earlier work.Other tracks Harmony Perfect Harmony and Slip Away are slower numbers which work well.All in all a disco type album many Four Seasons fans will enjoy."
4,Another entertaining collection of mulletude,"While I prefer the original Mullets Rock CD, this is another entertaining collection. The songs are all well known mullet-love masterpieces, and the artwork is as hilarious as the artwork on the first effort."
4,Bunn Coffee Decanter,The all glass decanters work much better than the ones with a metal bottom. The metal ones scorch the coffee and tend to leak out the sides also.I originally received my 2 glass decanters very poorly packaged. They were in a large box side by side with no protection around them so needless to say one of them arrived in a million pieces.I emailed the company right away and within 24 hours they sent me 2 replacements packaged properly in their own individual boxes then those boxes were protected in a larger box.
5,Music from my childhood,"Like many others here, I grew up listening to this album every Christmas as far back as I can remember. It's as much a part of my family Christmas tradition as anything else we do for the holiday. My only problem is that it has problems playing back on my PC (the 1st disc I've ever had problems with), but plays just fine on my CD player in the living room. A must have for Christmas."
2,fisherman,Seemed to work OK but the company did not send what was in there add. Thats why the rated was low
1,Not happy,"I assumed that buying this thing from you would be painless. It was delivered two days late and needed 5 hours of hard work to assemble it. When I got it working, it leaked so much oil from the control valve that I couldn't use it. Northern replaced that valve for me which took me another three hours to do as well as oil spilled. With some wood, it won.t split and the geomitey of it will not allow it to be set up without jacks or other forces.I am generly unhappy with this purchase and wish that I had never done it"
3,When you need to go a bit deeper into cleaning,"This book is filled with tips. It does not tell you step-by-step how to get a room clean, as does so well the magnificent ""Speed Cleaning"" by professional cleaner Jeff Cambell. So, as a companion to Speed Cleaning, 10-minute Housekeeping is like the frosting to the cake (the cake being Speed Cleaning).It takles specific problems: pleated lampshades (baby hairbrush), inside of microwave (water with white vinegar on high setting), stainless steel appliences (waterless hand sanitizer), and many more. I found about 10 tips to be usefull to me.But, since what I needed was a detailed plan of speedy weekly cleaning, I give this book only 3 stars. Its a good book to have once you have the basics down."
1,Buyer Beware,"Don't be mislead with the headline AquaSurge 5000 in the real world it performs like a 3,000 pump. It is a bait and switch tactic to make you think you are getting a pump that delivers 5,000 GPH"
4,Classic Martin Luther,Glosses over much of Luther's life but does hit the high points. Great classic film. Well remastered. The quality was good.
2,Welding and brazing,This book had a lot of nice pictures but not much information. It was somewhat entertaining if you liked Monster Garage but not very helpful. I needed more specifics on how to do it since I have not welded since high school and that was a long time ago. I ended up going to the library and getting a big heavy book on the subject and that was much more helpful.
3,"Best in series, but...",...it's not a very good series. The book does contain useful information about electric welding processes. However it leans too heavily towards welding for aerospace - a reflection of the author's background. Bottom line is there are better welding resources out there that support custom car building. As a Monster Garage souvenir it misses the grade with only a passing reference to the show and Jesse James.
4,"Four Stars For Rejar,Lilac who??","After reading all three books in this series,I must say the men are to die for. The woman should have been killed. But maybe its the fact that the mens charecters are soo hot,it would be hard to make a female as interesting. All in all I loved the books,thought they were funny and well wrote,if a little vauge on some of the plots. Iam waiting for the next novel of Traed and possibily one of the parents also. Hopefully it will be soon!"
5,PERFECT,"I have fallen inlove with Rejar, his relationship with Lilac was perfect. Rejar character's was so kind and very sensitive, you could feel how much he cared and loved her. Lilac was so sweet and innocent, it was a perfect match."
4,Very Good Read,"This second book in the Matrix series (the sequel to Knight of a Trillion Stars) was another great novel by Joy. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I read it immediately after I read the first book and the first book suits my taste in romances better. (It was funnier, the heroine was spunkier.) Had I read them out of order and finished this one first, I probably would have given this a 5.Rejar is a great historical book (very little of it takes place off-planet like Knight of a Trillion Stars) and is worth the money."
2,just not good enough!,"THE BEGINING WAS VERY AMUSING BUT AS IT GETS ON I JUST DON'T FEEL THE ROMANCE ANYMORE. THE SEX IS PRETTY MUCH CONSTANT BUT THE HEROINE'S CHARACTER WAS WAY TOO CHILDISH. SHE DOESN'T REALLY CHANGE UNTIL THE END OF THE BOOK. SHE'S NOT VERY EXCITING OR UNDERSTANDING LIKE THE OTHER FEMALE IN DARA JOY'S OTHER BOOK. THE GIRL JUST LEFT ME COLD AND SORRY FOR THE GUY. WELL, THE GUY IS VERY SWEET AND TRIED TO WOO HER FROM THE BEGINING TO THE END. AT FIRST IT WAS JUST A CHALLENGE TO HIM BUT THEN IT BECOMES A LOVE CHASE. I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY CUTE. ALTHOUGH HE'S A GREAT CHARACTER, THE ONGOING OF HIS MASCULINITY IS VERY ANNOYING IN THE HEROINE'S POINT OF VIEW. IT MAKES ME THINK SHE'S LUSTING AFTER HIM. BUT ANYWAY, I FIRST I ENJOYED THE BOOK BUT STILL IT LEFT ME UNCERTAIN OF THEIR FUTURE TOGETHER. IF IT WAS ANY OTHER HEROINE, THIS BOOK WOULD HAVE PULL IT OFF EASILY."
2,What a disappointment,"Given all the hype about her, I was expecting something more from Dara Joy. While there were entertaining scenes, I found the prose, and the characters to be irritating. References to ""said cat"" leaped out at me through out the first half. The secondary characters seemed to be constructed of the flimsiest cardboard, and, once you got past the gimmick of the book (shape-changing alpha-male alien woos Regency England babe), the plot seemed very unimaginative. My wife says the next one is much better."
3,An exciting story without a stong ending,"While Regency England is one of my favorite settings for romantic fiction I wasn't quite satisfied by this book. Rejar, the character, manages to maintain his place in society by the fact that he is an ""original"". His interaction with Lilac is excellent and the love scenes are great!The reason I didn't give this book more than 3 stars is I felt the ending was contrived. It was too convenient how Lilac suddenly accepted Rejar as her husband. The book also didn't leave me with a sense that the story was complete. I wanted to know more about Rejar's quest.I am hoping that there will be a third story in this series, which started with Joy's _Knight of a Trillion Stars_. Because _Rejar_ was the second book you will find continuation of the story line of the first, which adds to both stories.It was written very well which is why I am looking forward to more books by this author."
5,"This sensual, fun story piques the imagination!","I have read, literally, hundreds upon thousands of novels - mostly historical romances. When I read ""Rejar"", my search for the perfect novel was over. Rejar was sexual, funny, and endearing. Lilac was an unwitting magnet to him. This book was extremely well-written, not to mention extremely sexy. Dara Joy is now my, unrivaled, favorite author. I can't wait to read her other works."
2,Not a fan,"I truly did not care for this book as a textbook. It reads more narrative style and it is very difficult to find information quickly. The author makes some great points, but the book as a whole is poorly organized and written. In my course evaluation, I suggested the professor discontinue the use of this book. This is one of the very few textbooks from graduate school that I don't mind reselling. We used this in conjuntion with Nancy Helm-Estabrooks' Aphasia Manual, which was a much easier read."
4,A hilarious spoof on science fiction! Funny and readable.,"This is one of the classic funny science fiction novels. Don't even think about taking it seriously, but this is a book to be read on a long boring afternoon with beer and chips.Harry Harrison tells the story of Bil (one ""l""...two letters for officers only, bowb, know your place..."") who is tricked into volunteering for the Troopers, the army of a very ramshackle, barely functioning, galactic empire. The laughs begin on the first page and don't stop. This book manages to poke fun at just about every novel or movie ever written or produced about starships, starship troopers, or galactic empires. In fact, this book manages to poke fun at novels and movies that were written long **after** Bill the Galactic Hero was published. Now that is the mark of your true timeless classic!This is a fun book that will please most readers."
3,Camilla & Charles: A Selfish Love Affair,"While I felt that this was an interesting read I felt the author painted an unfair portrait of Diana. She portrayed Diana as a crazy, unstable shrew and yet it was Charles refusal to end his relationship with Camilla that caused Diana to be so unhappy and angry. I don't think there are very few women on this planet that would be happy and accept the fact that their husband has a mistress for 20 years that he refuses to give up after marriage. It proved to me at least, that Diana was justified in her ending her marriage and giving up the throne. The author paints Charles and Camilla as 2 poor lovers who go through hell just to be together. I felt no sympathy for either of them. But it is an engrossing book none the less."
3,Frog and Dog,"While I no doubt the frog aka Prince Charles loved his dog I usually refer to her horse face Camilla;he and she went into his marriage with Diana knowing full well what they were about. I have no care of either of them and only sadness for Diana. I saw them on television all those years ago when the media asked them if they were in love...Diana's reply was ""of course"", while Frog's was ""what ever love is""...that told me all I needed to know about him...he had both feet of his parents on him to get a heir. Now he can live out his life being horse face's tampon.Great pic of the cover showing just what style and beauty Diana had verse's...that other thing. Almost the same dress except for the length and even down to choker.While it is not Christian to state what I have;I blame them;they started the path to Diana's death."
5,Tart pan,"This type of pan is almost impossible to find in the stores. I was quite happy when I discovered it on the web, and was not disappointed when I received it. Just what I wanted!"
4,Classic R&R,"Although there's only three songs that I like on this CD, The 4 Season's version of Little Darlin' is reason enough to buy this compilation:)"
4,Very good for this genre,"This is one of my favorite series of this genre. It is easily up there with Salvatore as an example of how fun and entertaining this pulp fantasy can be. This work, more than much of the toilet paper printed by other gaming worlds, is nuanced and original. I wish there was more out there like this to read on a sunny beach or a dark corner."
2,"Wonderful designs, but....","I recently purchased this book, and was somewhat disappointed. I am a beginning beader like the other reviewer. I found the instructions were not clear and are difficult to follow. I recently finished an extensive bead and wire class (i.e.4 week course). I also agreed with one of the reviewer, in regards to materials. The book uses the WigJig on several of the projects. It would have been nice to see more designs using just wire techniques. This book is not for a beginner. It is intended for the more seasoned wire worker."
1,"Should be called ""Look at Finished Product""","This book shows a finished piece of jewelry and gives some written instructions. NOT HELPFUL! It's almost like going to Macy's, looking at jewelry and going home to try guessing how it is made. This is really the worst book I've ever seen that claims to teach ""Making Bead & Wire Jewelry"". I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK."
1,Impossible to find refills for this dumb mop,"The Quickie web site says that the HomePro mop (model 041) uses the 0472 & 0473 mop refills, which are ""Type H."" Amazon tells a different story? Who's right? I have definitely wasted more than 2 hours of my life getting the wrong refills at Safeway and my local hardware store.The best use for this mop, as far as I can tell, is to take this mop and smash my computer screen, because my only choice before contributing more waste to the landfill is to take a gamble and buy the refill that Amazon wants me to buy--the Type J--which is not the manufacturer recommended Type H refill. Even writing this review is a waste of my time. I feel this mop has aged me by at least 20 years. Cruel world. I just want to clean my floors."
4,great for the kindle price,"ive read better from Witness Lee, but still enjoyed portions. if you are in the mood for some neat insight concerning Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob then you will like this quick read."
3,CISSP Training Guide by Roberta Bragg,"I personally liked the way this book was organized and found it easy to read and understand.The information was helpful in preparing for the CISSP exam but I must caution prospective buyers to consider additional study resources rather than relying solely on this book.Some areas of the book did not go into enough detail on the subject matter. Specifically, some things you are expected to answer in the CISSP exam was not covered enough for you to answer the question correctly.The PreLogic test engine included with the book had numerous errors. Sometimes the answers were blank, sometimes the answers shown was marked as wrong but when reading the explanation it was actually right.I am glad that I puchased other CISSP books besides just this one. The combination of study material is what provided me with the knowledge to pass the exam.Good luck in your quest for CISSP"
5,Great shoes,This is my first pair of Bruno Magli shoes and I feel very fortunate that I was able to find my size at this price. I will buy from this manufacturer again.
2,Too Much of a Great Thing,"The first three installments in the ""Anne of Green Gables"" series have to some of the most wonderful, enchanting, all-around greatest books I have ever read. L.M Montgomery has done an absolutely splendid job bringing to life the red-headed girl with a fiery temper to match, but the farther I progressed into the series, the more disappointed I became. For me, the series became monotonous and depressing; the war kills Anne's beloved child, and I cannot help but despair in the numerous times Anne is mentioned with streaks of gray hair, and wrinkles in her face. This is not the lively girl of Avonlea I have come to so dearly love. So, my advice to you would be to read the first three books, and the first part of the 5th, for the end of the series should not overshadow its timeless, and inexpressibly wonderful beginning."
4,Panasonic KX-TG5776S 5.8GHZ Phone,I was basically very satisfied with this product with the exception of the volume level. At the highest volume it is still fairly difficult to hear the other party. If I had known this I probably would not have bought this phone as this is fairly important to the function of the phone.
1,Just short of useless.,"The book basically gives you an outline of things to study, test-taking strategies, and a practice test. I don't know about you, but I don't need anyone to tell me how to understand a question, I need a crash course in music history and theory to prepare. The book reviews absolutely no content. NOTHING. It breaks down questions so you understand, reminds you not to panic, and gives you a practice test, that's it. At most, it explains the answers to practice questions, but unless I'm going to see that exact question on the test (probably not), that still doesn't help me.If you're an awful test-taker and need strategies, sure, buy it. If you need to take a practice test, sure, this'll do the job. If you need to know what to study, yeah, this gives you an outline. Just don't expect to actually study anything from the book because it gives you none of that."
3,Best book so far about the Balkans,I thought it was a pretty good story. The prose is functional not elegant. But the story informs by enertaining. I thought Fullerton's Russo convincing. My thoughts return to Dennis Quaid in Savior and my expereinces in the placid atomosphere of Romania. I'm thinking about giving this book as someone's Christmas present.
4,T-Fal 1749 Ultraglide Diffusion Iron,This is one of the better irons I have owned. I like the one feature that it doesn't have an automatic shut down. Because when I need the iron during my sewing I don't want to have to wait for it to reheat. Also the steam is excellent.
4,T-fal Iron Review,"I've used T-fal irons exclusively for the past 10 years. The non-stick plate is its best feature. I have turned my family into T-fal iron users also. Since Hurricane Katrina, my family and I have been replacing our T-fal irons!"
3,Slightly disappointed,"I reviewed several irons and purchased this one because it seemed to be the best without getting really pricey. It does a good job with either light or heavy fabrics. There are two things that disappointed me about the iron: it does not have an auto shut off (I left it on a whole day), and I have yet to figure out where the mark is to tell which fabric the iron is set for. I have obviously turned it too high for some fabrics (they stick to the iron, and the soleplate of the iron has an area of brown residue that I will have to try to clean). Because of these two things, I have already ordered another brand of iron."
2,The little radio that thought it could,"Maybe you will and maybe you won't pick up a signal. It is hard to tune or obtain a strong signal with this radio. I live in a valley surrounded by mountains and I get a very poor reception. So I take the radio up to a higher elevation, say around 3500Ft ASL, and I still get a poor reception on this radio. The speakers are weak but the batteries last a long time. I wish now that I sent it back. I am still looking for a decent and affordable Worldband radio. I don't know if I will consider a Kaito."
2,Shortwave is weak,"I bought this because I wanted to hear stations in either Europe or the Middle East. I really can't hear any of those places. I heard Toronto, Mexico, one Asian country, and a French speaking station that wasn't come out clear enough. The AM and FM are very good, though. And it is a very small radio. But I am looking for a strong Shortwave at a bargain, and I didn't get that."
5,"The Cd Is Wonderful,I Love Ever Song On It.",Voices of Theroy is a wonderful group the CD is wonderful.Ever song is THE BOMB!i Play The CD ever day and I fall and love with each song over and over again.
3,Disappointed previous Panasonic fan.,"Speakerphone base does not have a caller ID screen so you have to have the handset at the base in order to see who is calling. Caller ID announcer is difficult to understand. Cannot set answering machine pickup to more than 3 rings. We frequently cannot get to phone in 3 rings when handsets are on the charger. Do not really care for the process of checking & deleting messages. This is probably one of the best products out there with the features we were looking for, we are just disappointed based on the previous ""outdated"" set we have. Hoping that when we have to replace this set, Panasonic will have improved this version. Will definitely buy Panasonic again."
4,Greate Book for AD agency producers.,"This book give a comprhensive view to productions from the view point of an Ad agency producer, very usefull for any one who in ad agency or thinking of getting in to same."
5,Just BUY it. NOW.,"This is the premier death metal album that will take the genre into the new millennium. Karl Sanders explains every song in detail, taken from Egyptian history and legend, and even explains the recording techniques of the instrumentals. ""Black Seeds of Vengeance"" is something every fan of this music can relate to. With the title track as an entrance into the abyss, Nile pulls no punches as they blast first and never let up throughout the entire length of the album. ""Masturbating the War God"" and ""Chapter for Transforming"" are the other choice tracks. A solid album from beginning to end. Not for the weak."
5,Wonderfully written book.,"This is from the my perspective as a basic research scientist and sometimes informal hiker and naturalist who never took zoology or botany too seriously, but on a whim wanted to know more about plant evolution.This is a wonderful book. It is engagingly written, and more importantly isn't a litany of facts, but rather discusses the topic in the context of biomes, geology, and the evolutionary solutions reached by plants.One small modification would be useful. Although the book is remarkably jargon free a few more terms in the glossary would have been useful to the non specialist. This said, as a non-specialist I read this book cover to cover and highly enjoyed it."
4,Would recomend,"Well written but very dark. There is a light at the end if the tunnel, but feels like it comes to late."
5,"Painful, but highly important reading","I found ""The Warmest December"" to be very painful reading, but couldn't put it down. Through the vehicle of fiction, McFadden studies the impact of alcoholism and domestic abuse upon the lives of children. McFadden explores the emotional, psychological and economic reasons why women stay with abusive men, and the destructive consequences of remaining in such a relationship. Although she vividly depicts the nightmare of cruelty and destruction that can accompany alcoholism, she also writes about the potential for healing and redemption."
3,OK. Book,Pretty depressing for a Holiday read. Always difficult to understand how families could have such dysfunctional people and still stay together
4,Distressing,"This book was very disturbing to me and at the same time, I couldn't put it down. I can't imagine having to go through life the way Kenzie had. Ms. McFadden gave me insight on what it is like to be the wife/daughter of an alcoholic and the reason(s) for staying in that relationship. An important lesson was reiterated, ""Forgiveness is good for the soul."""
3,Depressing,Very depressing but I know this happens all the time in the US and this saddens me. People should know about this type of thing
1,The warmest December,Understanding enough to be able to forgive is first real step to a true and strong sobriety. Sobriety is not just not having a drink its facing the reasons you drink and realizing you deserve the right to better life. This story says it all.
5,Greatest Cartoon on Earth,"The Family Guy is the funniest cartoon ever. Peter is a fat moron who doesn't have a clue about the Earth and he loves drinking beer and watching Tv. The rest of his family include Stewie the little baby who wants to conquer the world. Brina he martini loving dog, Lois his wife who tries to keep him in order, Chris who will probably grow up to be just like his dad, and Meg, the teenage drama queen. This family get sinto all sorts of predicaments but it's so funny. Peter always gives up time that would be spent with his kids to go hang out with his friends. This show is so great and i'm glad it will be coming back in January next year."
1,"Sucks, basically","You can try all you want to pretend the Family Guy is'nt a sad, low-brow ripoff of the Simpson's but you'd be living in denial. It speaks volumes about a show when, by far, the most interesting character is the familiy dog. You might laugh here and there in between the celebrity cheap-shots and painfully typical movie parodies but I would'nt hold my breath. Bottom line: the Family Guy is to the Simpson's, as Go-Bots were to Transformers."
2,Not very good,"I guess Family Guy has some funny moments, but I completely agree that Family Guy is a complete copy of The Simpsons. I think for the most part it's pretty boring and never makes you laugh nearly as much as the Simpsons. All in all, I don't think Family Guy is worth buying."
3,NOT Better Than The Simpsons!,"""The Simpsons"" is classic! Peter is funny and very stupid, but not stupider and funnier than Homer. I will give this show its props it did push the envelope when it came to issues, but ""The Simpsons"" debuted in the 80's very different from now. Homer is an icon, i don't see how any one can come on here and say Peter was better than Homer, the best cartoon character created. The DVD set is a good collection and if your a fan of the simpsons you'll like this show, one thing that turned my off from this show is that annoying baby."
3,"Funny and different, but destined for oblivion","Family Guy was a very humorous addition to broadcast TV, although fans may have had a hard time keeping up with its constant schedule changes. It has never failed to make me laugh, and often raise an eyebrow asking ""Did they really say that?"" Unfortunately, the humor in it is highly topical and dated, and many of the references will become more obscure as time passes. Unlike the Simpsons, who balanced topical humor with parody and tributes to many classics, Family Guy is destined to be a footnote in animated television."
5,All Season 1 and 2 episodes are here.,"Disregard the poster that claims there are missing episodes. He or she doesn't know what they are talking about. Season 1 had 7 episodes and season 2 had 21 episodes, so they are all here. Season 3 (22 episodes, one unaired) will be coming later this year.Excellent Show!"
5,How Can I wait for The Next Season?,"I love this friggin' show so much. I can't begin to tell you how funny it is. I own the first DVD set, yet I watch it on Cartoon Network almost every night. I love this show. If laughing you like doing, then must you get this. Oh yes, this is funnier than people who try to tell you that Episode 1 and 2 were good films. You thought they were? HAHAHAHAHAHA!!! Oh..you were serious...HAHAHAHA!!!! Jake Lloyd is all I have to say, but then again there's Jar-Jar, or Hayden Christiansen, or whoever casted it, or the scripts, or......."
5,FANTASTIC SHOW! DON'T MISS EVEN ONE EPISODE!,"This is an awesome, awesome show. I can't tell anyone in words how funny and exciting this show really is. This show has jokes that will leave you laughing about them for days to come. You will want to run to your friends and tell them about this show. If you are the least bit of a fan of Family Guy, this set is for you. In a larger picture, EVERYONE who is a fan at all of Family Guy should not hesitate one second to purchase this awesome DVD set. Don't worry at all: I gurantee you will never be disappointed with this!"
3,"Almost Simpson-like, but not quite","personally, Quahog's favorite family doesn't quite reach the classic comic antics of Springfield, but it does have its charms. Probably my two favorite characters are Brian the talking dog and of course, Stewie the megalomaniac infant. Those two steal the scenes everytime!!! Possibly the least likeable character is Peter, the patriarch. He's quite the wanna-be Homer, boorish without being likeable. Unlike Homey, Peter is an ugly drunk with delusions of grandeur. How the wife ever fell for the fool beats me. Other than the father, each of the other characters can at least original. All in all, this set would be a great complement to the one series that started it all."
4,"quantity, yes....quality, no","This comes with the full seasons 1 and 2. Since it's early in the series some of the voices are a little bit different, like Chris'. There are a lot of episodes per discs which I loved. Had a few of my favorites on it. The only thing is that once i was watching the second season, just wasn't as good as the first or 3, 4, or 5. This is a must for all family guy fans!!!"
4,"Don't Die Laughing, We Could Get Sued.","""Family Guy"" is always funny. Maybe sometimes over the top, but always funny. It is a comedy about about a dim dad (Peter, a smart and sassy mom (lois), a teenage drama queen (Meg), a smart and person like dog (Brian), a fat dumb 13 year old (Chris), and an evil baby (Stewie). Generally enjoyable and load of laughs comedy, ""Family Guy"" proves (in my opinion) to succeed ""The Simpsons""!-Ben Russell"
5,Unbelievably great show,"This show can be described in one word: fast. The jokes just keep coming. Family Guy is also good at producing shock value, with deeply penetrating jokes and satire. Highly recommended for all comedy fans."
3,Censored!?!?!?,"I have to be one of the biggest Family Guy fans, but what the heck. How dare they not add the unaired episode in this dvd but they put it in the region 2 dvd. Not only that but they censored one episode, the osama bin laden joke was taken out the ""Road to Rhode Island"" episode"
5,Family Guy Rules,The Family Guy is by far the funniest show to come along since The Simpsons. I was shocked when it was cancelled for Greg the Bunny. That show sucked and lasted about 1 month. I wish they would bring back the show or at least release new episodes on DVD. This DVD is a must for any Simpsons fan.
5,Lush beautifully arranged classic holiday tunes,"This album was released several years ago (with a different, but gorgeously photographed cover) and it has become a staple of my personal holiday listening fare.The arrangements & instrumentation are lush, classic, lovely and have withstood the test of time since they are all of a traditional nature.Standout tracks include ""Christmastime is Here,"" the stirring ""Overture,"" ""White Christmas"" - a duet with Ms. Boone's late mother-in-law, Rosemary Clooney and a beautifully sung ""Hark the Herald Angels Sing.""Debby Boone's touching version of the oft forgotten ""Some Children See Him"" is also not to be missed.Christmas is simply not the same for me withoutHome for Christmasby Debby Boone. Five Stars."
4,Crystal clear conversation,"As with all typical Plantronics headsets, this sound is clear and no one can tell you are on a headset on the other end. My only gripe is the cord seems a bit fragile the the earpiece volume is not as loud as it should be for use in a vehicle which is why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. Other than that, it works very well and is fairly comfortable for extended wear on your ear. I like the fact that it does not go over your ear so wearing glasses is not a problem at all."
1,"charger OK, but phone -- forget it!","Have the charger and the phone, and I hated it so much 00 it's too big for my hards! -- that I gave it away!"
1,Not as funny,I didn't like this cd as much as some of the previous ones. Its like hes trying to clean up his act a little because of his family. The other Larry the Cable Guy cd's are much funnier than this one.
3,Too Much Poop,"Larry just cracks me up sometimes but he is getting way too poopy for my..dare I say, taste.LOL. Anyway, this has some real laughs but as another reviewer pointed out, the earlier stuff was better. By the way Larry, you used the Wal-Mart checker's brow and low prices line in Bare Arms. C'mon guy, you can do better than this. I hope you aren't under a quota from the recording company."
3,Good but one gripe...,"I am a big fan of Larry the Cable Guy and I thought this cd was great expect for one thing: he recycled about 3 jokes from his old stuff. His last big joke about him doing a 69, was straight from his last cd, even the punchline was the same. Overall, I laughed alot but come on Larry, theres no excuse for using old jokes."
2,Running out of material,"Sure there are a few laughs here, but they are fewer and farther between than his first CD or two. Simply put, his material isn't as sharp and surprising as it once was.Apparently, he thinks anything he thinks of and writes down on a napkin is gut-busting funny. Some of it is, but most of it isn't.The best thing ""Larry"" could do, recording-wise, is take 2-3 years off, re-focus his delivery, and bounce back with some GREAT material.If he keeps putting out mediocre stuff like this, his star will fade sooner rather than later."
4,A bit disappointed . . .but the artwork is gorgeous,"Honestly, I was a little disappointed when I got MKR. I think it was mainly because the translation wasn't that great. I noticed that Cephiro was spelled two different ways. I dunno. It just could have been better. The story itself seems promising, but the first volume just didn't have that extra 'umph' that made me seek out the next volume. I rated MKR 4 stars mostly because of the art. CLAMP's artwork is beautiful and very unique, so that alone gets 2 stars, the story itself gets 1, and I gave the extra star for Mokona cause his so kawaii! ^__^ I personally like Card Captor Sakura and X/1999 better,(buy the X/Zero collection artbook!) but, y'know ... whatever floats your boat. . ."
2,Lacking support,I weigh over 200 lbs. and this cushion offers little if any support. Save your cash unless you weigh very little.
1,why?,Okay this U.S DVD is just a mess okay. There are so many people that have already bought this movie online that this new release serves no purpose what so ever. And worst of all they are going to release this U.S cut which is 20 mins shorter than the original Hong Kong release which is my personal favorite. If you like this movie my advise go and search other asian DVD internet stores. They have a version that you would like better and they come in a 2-disc case loaded with features. But if you did not like this movie then ignore what I wrote.
5,Wonderful! Stunning movie!,"I had been looking for this movie on DVD since not long after it came out in theatres.Visually stunning, wonderful color that really flows thru the entire story. The story is incredibly touching. Worth watching over and over again.DVD quality is great! Special features are so cool! Dubbing was very well done (although having British voice actors was a little strange) but I would recommend watching it with original audio with subtitles.First- rate DVD experience all around. Highly recommended!"
1,POOR QUALITY good idea,this is great idea. I bought 3. This product is VERY Cheaply made and was ineffective in keeping tie in holder. I never used it and ended up returning them. DONT BUY
3,Needs updating.,"I received this book as a gift. Based on reviews I read, I requested it. I am disappointed. It is the usual basics, covering the usual of composition, center of interest, perspective, atmosphere, color harmony, da da etc. I actually think I might have gotten more out of it, if the paintings depicted weren't so distracting. I found them boring, mostly of the same color palette of yellows, oranges, burnt umbers with a little green here and there. Every tree looked the same and with the exception of a barn, a few birds or corn rows, everything was interchangeable.Unless you're a beginner, I don't recommend this book. There are many other more recent books that offer SO much more...for instance Color And Light by James Gurney. Now there's a five star book!"
5,Lots of valuable information for beginners/pros alike,"Good solid information and examples. Value scales, color harmony, and composition are discussed in a way that makes sense and is demonstrated visually. Very happy with this book and the ideas it helps to bring to fruition."
1,Messy,"I was using a similar product and found these to try. It seems to take off the color in layers, so multiple wipes need to be used. Also it leaves the color you took off all over your finger tips. Overall, very messy. I gave them away."
3,Small,Thought this was going to be bigger but only blew up to be 44 inches. The girl who got it for Christmas loved it tho
4,Small,"I have a small just 4yr old daughter (31 lbs)....I don't think this would have been an ok gift if she were any bigger. A lot smaller than I expected, but perfect for her right now."
2,WAY smaller than advertised,"We received this ball as a gift for my 5 year old. The box says ages 4+, and the picture on the box shows a child approximately 3 years old holding a huge ball. It is very misleading, as it only blows up to about 36"" circumference. It is TINY-smaller than a beach ball. It is PERFECT for our THREE year old. I would say the perfect age range for this toy is 18 months-3yrs, NOT ages four and up. My five year old is VERY disappointed that she can't play with this ball as effectively as her little sister. The product packaging is VERY misleading!!!"
5,Captivating love story between two subborn characters,"Very enjoyable book. Storyline based in the gothic era after Kenric ""The Butcher"" returns from his 3rd tour of duty in the Crusades. He is ordered by King Edward to rescue Tess, Lady Remmington from her evil step father. She is running for her life since she's suffered physical abuse from her step-father & his clan. She meets Kenric and nothing is the same. Both characters are stubborn & tend to ""misinterpret"" the other person's feelings. However they eventually admit their love & as they say...Love Conquers All... Great read; 1st in the Warlord series!!!!!!"
5,"Excellent... It was well wriiten, fast paced, and magical.","I read a clip of The Warlord in a writing manual and I was hooked. I had to order a copy for myself. I wanted to be Tess and be the one forced to marry Kenric the warlord. I could identify with the charcters and the plot had so many twists that it kept me on the edge of my seat. I've read the book a few times and each time I pick it up, I notice I something I missed that makes the story even more enjoyable. It was the kind of story that is worth reading over and over again."
5,Great,Great overall transaction. Everything went well. The shipping was prompt and the price was great. Amazon has the best customer service.
3,one of the first computer hacker movies,"As unlikely as it seems a young high school computer hackerlogs into a government super computer that controlsICBM launching across the United Stated.The resulting trouble almost causes WWIII with Russiawhen the AI in control of the super computer wants to play games.Tron (20th Anniversary Collector's Edition),Sneakers (Collector's Edition)andHackersare some of the movies Hollywood has made to exploit this gold mine of the personal computer."
5,Still a great movie,"CD arrived as promised. This movie takes you back, with all the 'high tech' references, but it still holds together after 25 years."
5,Definitely a classic!,"Great movie! I loved it! Wish I could get the soundtrack. I'm surprised the song ""Video Fever"" didn't catch on more than it did.So when's Wargames2 coming out? Perhaps Matthew Broderick can be the dad this time! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!"
4,Excellent DVD to refresh our Cold War computer fears,"I admit that I have an affinity for films that play on a human's fear of computers (like Desk Set). It seems silly to us now, but let us remember a time when the computer was a rare item in the home. And never forget that people are always more afraid of something that they do not understand. War Games combines this fear of something unknown with the greatest fear of the 1980's, nuclear war. Can a kid hack into the government war system and trick us into thinking that the Soviets are launching a surprise attack?There are two very funny moments to watch for in this film. First, does the military give guided tours to the public of NORAD? My guess is no, but it is cleverly included in the plot. Second, listen to the background when Matthew Broderick enters his parents house and goes upstairs. Something about ""condom recycling""? I guess they wanted to see how close we were paying attention."
4,Great Movie,"I bought this movie because it has a very nostalgic feeling for me, but the movie is quite well, is not that well made, and the acting is not that really good.With all his flaws this is a great movie because of the Plot which is great, and creates the feeling of not knowing what is going to happen."
4,Entertaining,"As commentary against Cold War values, this film can't compare with a great films like ""Fail Safe"" or ""Dr. Stranglove."" Still, this film has enough good will, mixed in with an important point, to be very enjoyable. Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy have a great amount of appeal and chemistry in the two lead roles, and the supporting cast is alright as well (though it seems unrealistic that so many men in such high places could be such idiots). Although we don't really dought the ending, director John Badham manages to add just enough suspense to keep things from being too predictable. Well worth a watch, but don't expect a masterpiece."
3,War Games,"A bit silly and would never had happen in real life,just a cautionary tale with computers and nerd innuendo. decent to watch."
4,A well thought out plot which raises plenty of questions,This film was made in 1983 when the Cold War was still in full swing.The basic idea is that a teenage hacker gets into the NORAD mainframe and sets wheels in motion which bring the US and USSR closer to war. A lot of the action takes place at NORAD HQ under Cheyenne mountain.Computer geeks will love it as the screenplay is pretty well researched with the appropriate military acronyms and computing terms being used.It's a well thought out plot which raises plenty of questions such as the role of humans in the military decision making loops. It makes computing seem relevant and interesting and surely that's a good thing?Bloopers: 2 F-16's are launched... they turn out to be F-15's.The bottom line is I was thoroughly absorbed for the whole 108 minutes.
5,Get your retro computer geek on!,"I actually bought this movie because I was doing a Tic-Tac-Toe project with my AP Computer Science classes and I was told this movie was relevant :) and in the process of watching, I realized that I missed out on a classic! Between the vintage computer equipment and the social undertones which still apply today, this movie is a great watch, even for people like me who never saw it in the 80s. It's tough to find even in the most eclectic used DVD stores, so purchase here if you can. Also, never released on BD."
3,learning about what to eat with diabetes,This book is more about learning what to eat with diabetes than just a cook book. I was disappointed because I was looking just for a cook book for diabetics not a how to book.
3,Very experimental,"Basically a side project with Brian Eno, Wah Wah is basically a collection of odd ball half-baked songs that would have been album rejects. It is best listened to drunk and with pretzels, if that's not your everyday listening mode you will find this release too inconsistent for full length album listening. There are a few good songs but if you have all of James CD's and are looking to expand your collection just hunt down the b-sides of their many singles. I highly recommend that you look for any James b-sides off their CD singles from Laid up to the recent Pleased To Meet You CD before you invest in this project."
2,I Was Warned by the Reviews,I was trying to hang a coca cola tray on my wall. The reviews showed that the springs were too weak for plates. I thought it would work for a metal tray but I was wrong. I had ordered 2 hangers and had to use the springs from the 2nd hanger or the tray would sag enough for the top hooks to let go of the tray. The hooks are too large and thick and show too much.
5,Great fit,This belt is the best I've used for water aerobics. It doesn't need constant adjusting while in the water. So glad I found it.
5,Perfect and barely noticeable!,"This clear ring is the perfect size and is flexible and doesn't rub or get caught on clothing. If you sometimes want to make your piercing less noticeable, buy this! I didn't know what to expect buying body jewelry online but everything I ordered arrived quickly and is great quality!"
3,Interesting Piece of Americana,"I found this book among my grandmother's belongings after she died. The illustrations are only a bit risque by our standards but would have been quite racy by the standards of its publishing date of 1867. It's more a historical curiosity than anything else as it is printed in a dialect of English rather than standard English and it is a pretty thick dialect at that. Most of my students have a hard time reading it but find it humorous once they acquire the skill to read the dialect or, better yet, have it read aloud to them. (I use it when I explain to my classes why we write our English compositions in standard formal English.)"
1,"Great price and quality, until it died within 6 months.",This item failed within 5 months and 9 days. The Red went out. Warranty should cover it but what a inconvenience.
3,"Cute concept, but a little too silly for my taste","Overall, I like the concept of this book; The homework tips are great, and it is written in a catchy, funny way to make it entertaining for kids. My only complaint is that some of the jokes are a bit over the top- a bit too silly/ immature kind of humor. I am a school counselor and I was hoping to read it to students in my organizational skills groups, but there are a couple parts that I really don't feel comfortable reading out loud to the group. I have read small sections of it to the group as part of the curriculum and it went over very well."
4,Kid friendly,"I got this book for my 9yr old son, he found it funny and easy to read. Took all of 10mins but he laughed out loud a couple of times during the reading of it. Has some good tips that kids can relate to. I feel it's a bit overpriced for what it is."
5,To assure my vehicle emissions are correct,"Just what I needed. I would rather use factory *AC Delco* when available. The price was right and shipping was a snap. I am aware that AC Delco is a tad more expensive than after-market; however, in most cases, the item is a direct fit. Be sure to order the gasket separate; for one is not included."
4,Almost made the 5 star cut...,"I take 5 star ratings very seriously, saving that distinction for only the very best handful of albums in music history. With that being said, I had to struggle not to give this album 5 stars. Milton's second best to the 1972 classic ""Clube Da Esquina"", this is a very focused and beautiful tribute to Geraes. You will not be disappointed. Peak Milton."
5,Hotel Shampoo,"I got a good laugh when I opened the box. It came in this huge box with all sorts of packing cushion. This is a trial size. There's just about enough for you to use it for lip balm. It does what it is suppose to do. What can go wrong? Very little chance of failure with any brand of dielectric grease when applied properly. You just can't spend so much on such a small size. Vendors might give you a sample about this size along with a free wallet size calendar card. Perfect if you are only connecting two wires, installing 1 spark plug, or changing a light bulb. After all, why get stuck with a tube that you can actually use again later, when you can get this disposable application? I think MacDonald's ketchup & Taco Bell sauce packets hold more."
5,Amazing,"Kids of all ages will like this jazzy collection from america's favourite show.Aged between 5-8, or in my case 12+.This is so great although i would not be allowed it my self"
5,Rotational Shot video,"I was hoping to get some additional information to help one of our high school shot putters and I wasn't disappointed. This is a good video, it helped us!"
2,Upgrade my Jeter 360 Tee for a 'Tanner Tee',"I liked the placement options of the 360 however as this unit was used by my two boys (9-10 yrs) to hit the inside and outside pitches the ball holder was destroyed. This unit probably ok for young kids with slow bat speed, but as strength increases this unit will not hold up. Upgrading to [...] this unit is used by colleges/pros alike."
2,Too tiny,"These salad servers are barely bigger than a soup/ dessert spoon. I bought them for a craft, to make beaded salad servers as gifts for friends, but was really surprised at how small they landed up being. It was too much effort to return them, so I still beaded them, but I felt sheepish giving the gifts, as I had hoped for larger more impressive servers."
3,Interesting Show,"A neat show, not great but fun to watch and learn. HD transfer was not up to par, but still watchable."
2,Disappointing,"Not as interesting as the reivew has said. Actually, I found it quite boring in some episodes. Sorry for the poor review."
4,good,"the acoustic songs on the cd are very good. my personal favorite is make yourself although stellar is very good. pardon me sounds funny on acoustic guitar probably because singer brandon boyd tries some [very bad]rapping. the song crowded elevator is a non-lp song that was featured on the scream 3 soundtrack. it's pretty decent... nothing special but it reminds me of earlier incubus. the live tracks (favorite things + pardon me)are excellent. and the bonus track is very strange. it's called smoking the herb again. everybody has their theories on who is singing but nobody knows for sure. some say it's dj kilmore, jose, mike, and brandon but most people believe it's brandon and M.C.U.D. from hed planet earth.all in all it's a nice gift for an incubus fan and it's limited availablty(it's made in canada) promises it to be a rare collectable some day."
4,Not bad,"I've always waxed hot 'n cold on Patti Smith, but she does all right by several of the songs on here. If anything, I wish she'd dug a little deeper into the catalogs of some of the folks she covers here; for example, Smith doing Grace Slick's ""White Rabbit"" is good enough, but I'd have loved to hear her have a go at ""Eskimo Blue Day"" or ""Two Heads,"" two of Slick's more ""out there"" songs. But this is a quibble, especially when I never could've guessed that Patti Smith could cover The Allman Brothers and actually make ""Midnight Rider"" her own in a super version. This is a covers album that I won't mind playing again at all!"
4,"One of the better ""covers"" efforts","I believe that ""covers"" albums are little more than a stopgap (not unlike a quickie best-of or live set) to give an artist more time to come up with new original material. ""Twelve"" is no exception. However, this is a lot more creative than the covers CDs of GnR, Ozzy et al. Patti Smith is cleaver enough to pass most of these songs off as her own! With few exceptions (ie ""gimmie shelter"") she doesn't just deliver a carbon copy. Highlights: ""boy in the bubble"" and ""everybody wants to rule the world"" (good thing she grabbed that one before Marilyn Manson did!). Not all of it works, however: her overly somber take of ""white rabbit"" and the Cajun of ""smells like teen spirit"" could have been better. Plus, by the final third the listener's mind starts to wander. Still, this is a wrothwhile purchace for Patti Smith completists. Not bad at all..."
5,"I don't know if it deserved the Academy Award, BUT ...","I can say that this is a great script, as I've been reading some pages around the internet and I'll surely buy this book very soon. The dialogue, as well as the whole script, is very realistic, and also very enjoyable.I can't say if it really deserved the Award, but I can say that this script deserves to be read by every screenwriting fan."
3,Not quite as good as I had hoped,"Sometimes, it almost reminded me of The War with Kevin Costner, but not quite. The plot is okay, but what really makes it worth watching is David Strathairn. He's a brilliant every-man actor and does a good job with the character he is given, hinting at the depth that the writers never got around to writing. Gregory Smith does a good job in his role as the son. I also really like the daughter. I wish she had more screen time because she was entertaining. Plot gets 2 stars, but Strathairn and Smith bump this movie up to 3 stars."
2,I don't get it,"I realize this series is a huge hit, and I watched it in large part because the male lead (Damian Lewis) did such a fabulous job in Band of Brothers, but I really couldn't summon up any interest in either his or Claire Danes' characters. Nor did I get why a Marine sergeant who has been turned by al Quaeda would be such an enormous security risk that half the CIA is on his case. (I'm sure there's a reason--I think it's that he wants to shoot the VP, but I'm not sure, it wasn't clear to me.)Understand that the problem may be mine and not the drama's, but I didn't get more than halfway through episode 2 before throwing in the towel."
1,I've been foxed again,"The Company ""FOX"" did it again, I can not see the Serie, because its BluRay Region ""A"" The next thing I do is, I will buy a regionfree Player, so I can f..k back. I hate FOX!!!"
3,Watched first two episodes--won't watch any more,"There are things that I liked about the pilot and the first episode. The plot kept my attention and the acting was very good. But there was too much explicit sex and violence for my taste. I understand the show is about a Marine who was held captive and tortured for 8 years. But there was no need to show the torture and inhumane treatment in such detail. It could have been done more indirectly, without so much explicit violence. I felt the same way about the numerous scenes with couples having sex. Also, in one disturbing scene there was almost full frontal nudity with a woman who was interviewing for the job of a Middle Eastern prince's mistress. It dehumanized the character even more and also the actress. I won't be watching any more episodes."
5,Best show out there!,"I have only watched through episode 4. Am having to pace myself. We don't get showtime so I want to wait til I can get the second season to watch continuously. It's hard though, the kinda show you wanna curl up on the couch and devour the first season in one sitting. Fantastic!"
3,It's Okay,"I liked the characters and the acting but the story felt very much like a season of ""24"".Don't think I'll be tuning in for Season 2."
5,Homeland--So Many Plot Twists You'll Get Whiplash,"I white-knuckled my Kindle Fire while pigging out on the 13 episodes of season 1 over a two-day period, completely riveted by Homeland's compelling, complex characters and roller coaster plot twists. Enthusiastically recommended."
5,This is a really good show!,homeland is a very good show. i just wish showtime would post the shows to watch on Amazon sooner after it has aired. I'm willing to pay for it. Other shows I watch post the next day.
3,nothing spectacular,"I made it through the first season, binge watching in 4 nights over a week. I'm not sure what all the hype is about. I'll probably buy season 2, but will get it on dvd via netflix."
5,TERRIFIC SERIES . . . B U T . . .,"This is a great series -- very thought provoking, but I keep hoping Hollywood will turn out a series like this WITHOUT ALL THE NUDITY AND FOUL LANGUAGE. In that regard, this series is disappointing. Homeland has an all-star cast led by the intense Damien Lewis. It doesn't need the nudity and foul language for character development with such great actors on board. Enough said!!!"
5,Best series ever,"can't wait for season 2. This show is electrifying , full of suspense and is just a good example of good acting."
5,"""HOMELAND"" will keep you home watching your TV","Make certain you have your popcorn and drinks BEFORE you sit down to watch this tense, dark, well-written TV series, because you won't be able to turn away from the TV a second once you start. My family has become addicted to this action-packed, mystery involving the CIA, the government, terrorists and the dynamic acting of stars Claire Danes and Damian Lewis. The actors and writers deserve all the awards that have been given to them. Not written for children."
5,The BEST,An incredible series - one everyone should watch - but the access to it was spot on. A wonderful way to catch up on past seasons whenever you want.
2,Great Story....Why do they ruin it with trash?,If they would leave out the language and raunchy sex/nudity this would be an awesome show. I wish I didn't buy the whole season right off the bat.
5,Great choice,This was recommended by my sister. She was right! Riveting from start to finish. Can't wait to view the rest of the season.
2,Are you kidding?,"The whole premise of this series is nearly beyond imagination.A US marine that helps kill one of his buddies in Iraq? Seriously, between the implausible story and Danes as a CIA agent, the whole thing is unbelievable.Probably nobody is watching."
5,Great,Awesome story line!! Kept my husband and I guessing the whole time. Would most def reccommend this to other viewers.
4,Gripping!,We're only 5 episodes in and we're addicted. A great way to fill the winter break. You'll have a hard time watching just one in a sitting.
5,WOW!!,"This is an excellent new series, my husband and I really enjoyed it. I usually sit and watch television while doing needlework but I couldn't with this series. Kinda of reminds me of 24."
3,Not enough action.,Not as much action as I had hoped. I enjoyed 24 much better. I might try the second season but right now it's still pretty pricey.
5,Homeland Season 1,"Anti-war, anti-the-war-on-terror, and USA propaganda all at the same time. Made me ask myself big questions and find my own answers- great show."
5,Second viewing better than first...,Well done story that deserves a second look to pick up nuances missed first time.Quality of DVD is excellent.
5,Highly addictive,"Great story, great characters, excellent acting (especially Mandy Patinkin, Claire Danes, and Damian ? (""Brody""). Just a terrific show. Can't wait for Season 2 to hit Instant Video"
1,"Big names, big offense...",It sounded great - we're partial to the Marine Corp at our house. Bought the pilot and watched about 30 minutes of it; counted at least 10 f-words and finally turned it off in disgust when the second sex scene started. Wasted my money! jj Las Vegas
2,Great program . . . terrible DVD formatting,This DVD formatting is terrible. This listing says there are three discs and there are four. And the formatting that advances from one episode to the next doesn't work correctly so trying to be sure you are seeing all the episodes is a pain in the neck.The program is great. This DVD is the worst we have ever had.
1,Do not buy the Blu ray version - doesn't work,It is too buggy and asks you to insert the first disc after you've finished watching it. Do not buy the Blu-ray version.
4,HOMELAND the series,Well done series. I discover a new and interesting fact each time I view it. I'll share it with friends.
3,An interesting show,"I had heard a lot about Homeland, so I bought the DVD for the first season. I saw the first season and thought it was a good show. More sex and nudity than I had expected, which takes away from my enjoyment but I tolerated it. The story is reasonably good. The lead actress is especially good during the later part of the season when she has to go through a major personal transition. It shows good acting ability. (I am being vague here so that those who have not seen the season would not have the ending spoiled.) I preordered season two after watching season one, so it was good enough for me to want to see some more. I had heard so much about it that I expected better, but it was OK and worth watching. I'll review season two when I get it."
5,Great series!,"This series is top notch. The writing, directing and the acting are all exceptional. Keeps you wondering! Refreshing to find a well done series."
3,"awesome series, great picture, limited to viewing on kindle or PlayStation!",The only issue is that I cannot download it onto any device except the kindle. I am not a kindle user so I'm screwed watching it on PlayStation.
5,Homeland,One of the better shows on television. Great for someone who does not have access to showtime cable television station.
5,Homeland,"Great!!! Homeland is great show from the first episode. Every episode gets better and more captivating!! Unlike most T.V series, there are no filler shows to make a full season. So far the second season is following the same recipe for a great season!! A MUST SEE!!!!"
4,purchase Homeland via Amazon,I purchased this as a present for a family member. I had to wait for the price to come down to make it worth while.
5,Intense,Thanks for the quick turn and delivery. We have been savoring each episode to stretch it out while waiting for the second season to become available on DVD.
2,The Clare Danes Show,"Why oh why do I have to look at this hard faced actress in what appears seems to appear, every scene. When are we going to have a male actor to make this part more solid and believable. This series needed beefing up by not pampering to the female audience which is rampant throughout TV over the last twenty years."
3,"Great series, DVD fell short though","If you have not seen the series then I would highly reccomend you buy it. It is one of the best shows in the last 10 years. So when I heard the DVD was coming out I was excited and pre-ordered it so I would be able to see some behind the scenes, deleted scenes etc. Unfortunatly the DVD was so weak compared to the show. It had 5 or 6 deleted scenes, a little segement on the characters and only the first episode had a voice over thatdid nothing to explain the episode.Like I said before this is one of the best shows in the last 10 years, But if you have seen the series I would not reccomend buying the DVD."
2,Disgruntled,"Fabulous pilot but I thought my $2.99 was paying for the entire season, not jus t one episode of streaming, and it keeps prompting me for another payment when I try to move on to the next episode. What's with that? Mighty expensive, Amazon prime. An rethinking my subscription"
5,Homeland: The Complete First Season,This is a great series. It was very interesting from the very first. I can not wait for season two to come out.
5,Awesome,"Awesome Series! It's a wonderful show with fantastic acting! I can't wait for season two to come out! Ahhh! I just love homeland! A must see if you like anything like 24, James Bond, Bourne movies, Hurt Locker, or suspense!"
3,Mediocre,"If you're looking for a strong female lead or even a pseudo realistic plot, keep looking. Every female character in this show is a terrible cliche of unstable stupid females."
5,Fascinating Drama,"Have been a huge fan of Damien Lewis since I watched him in the Life series I discovered on Netflix. Was interested in the show because of Damien, but was pleasantly surprised to find excellent drama set in current political times. I enjoy the intelligence and the suspense. This show is addictive. Can't wait for Amazon to get season 2. Well worth the wait. I would recommend this show to anyone who enjoys good suspense, real life drama, and covert plots. This show is for the discerning and intelligent watcher who enjoys following the intricacies of a political thriller."
3,A simple book to find gorgeous looks,"If you are looking for a comprehensive, in-depth guide on vintage beauty, then this book will not satisfy you. However, if you want a good, short overview of all the different looks attached to your favorite decades, you'll like this book. As a collector of antique beauty books, I bought this title to read a modern woman's take on past beauty styles. I think the author did a good job selecting the different looks and providing the guidelines to create them. Overall, get this book to get a quick glance for inspiration."
1,Average at Best!!!!,"This book is completely useless to anyone trying to recreate these looks. There is not a single color photograph or even a color diagram to refer to. In fact, this book is completely black and white. As a professional makeup artist it is quite simple for me to look at a face and recreate it, however, any novice would have no guidance with this book. There is no way for someone to know what colors or products were used. With descriptions like ""Product Used: Lipstick"" I find it hard to believe that anyone would find much use for this. Some of the recipes in the back of the book are interesting, but I find it somewhat irresponsible that they were reproduced in this book- many of them are just plain dangerous and with so many young girls getting into makeup sooner, I fear they may try to recreate these products."
4,Its a good one but....,"This book covers all the steps you need to know but the thing i didnt liked is that it have a few chapters from other books. So if you have ""cheap tricks & special F/X of craig Fraiser"" you will not be happy to see a part of this book (37 pages). and from onother book i have - one about pinstripping (also Craig Fraiser's) (33 pages). So if you dont have these books i will recommend to add this one to your collection."
4,Good product.,Product arrived promptly. It was easy to carry and comfortable to sit on. I used it constantly for two weeks until I was healed. Lived up to Amazon's good products and service.
4,Good for the office,"Good for long sitting, but not very supportive in middle. Sinks slightly, would recommend for 150 pounds or less. Helpful."
3,Starting an Indexing Business,"An easy-to-read book that covers the basics. I would have liked it to have a bit more ""meat"" to it. At $30, I expected it to include more than what seemed like articles that would be available online."
3,Good the Second Time Through,"From early in the top decade for Perry Mason mysteries, the 1940s, this book offers a plot so complicated it took me two readings to sort it all out. Several plot threads, of the kind that in later books would have been followed up, are simply dropped here. For example, at one point, and after a long argument with her, Mason agrees not to tell the police about a woman he has just discovered at the scene of a murder -- and the woman never appears in the book again! The overall effect is good, though, sort of like a stew so rich you can't identify all the ingredients. A reader willing to draw maps and make character lists could get quite a lot of fun out of this one even on her first time through."
3,Mr. Ghost Whisperer,"Is Murray psychic? He talks to the dead and comforts them in their lonely graves. When he hears a new voice in the cemetery, he's sure it's Nikki, the cheerleader who has been missing for months. But who will believe him? He's a loser.Then along comes Pearl, daughter of the cemetery caretaker, who befriends Murray and tries to enter his world.I really loved the whole premise of a teen Mr. Ghost Whisperer, someone who communicates with the dead in cemeteries. Murray is a believable character, one I wanted to follow throughout the book.This is a fast read with twists among the way. I especially liked how the author wove in the mystery of who killed Nikki.What I felt took away from the story was the shift in different character's POV. I got confused and had to stop and go back a number of times."
5,A proud granddaughter,"I am the author's great granddaughter. She wrote this book when I was twelve years old and I remember our entire family being very proud of her and thankful to have her memories to treasure in writing. I love to read and re-read this book and I take in something new each time as I place myself in her shoes and imagine what it would have been like to live out her adventures. While I am most certainly biased, I can honestly say that this book is a pleasant and enjoyable read. It contains romance, history, and adventure and paints many delightful pictures for the reader. If you are inspired by stories of people who worked hard for everything they had then you will enjoy this book. This book, perhaps, was my great grandmother's attempt at reliving life's journey for herself while inviting others to enjoy the journey with her. I know that I am grateful for the places she took me in her memoirs."
1,The product they're selling here is a dud - possibly expired?,I had previously used this product many years ago and I remembered it to be very effective. It's supposed to burst into a cloud of white smoke a few minutes after you place it in the water cup.The product I received 3 days ago from Amazon (from Markson Supply) which I used today did not do that. There was just the tiniest wisp of smoke which left a thick gel on top of the can. I seriously doubt any bugs were killed today.There was no expiration date on the packaging so I couldn't really tell how old this stock is.I've had many satisfying purchases from Amazon. This is definitely not one of them.
3,50/50,"This is one my wife and like for different reasons. It was, by american standards, a hoaky film. But, it's Jackie Chan! It's a love story with some non-blood fight scenes. Ok, BOXING scenes. If you going to get the film, get the DVD to see the behind the scenes stuff. Brad Allen, who fights with Jackie, was cast specifically cast because he was smaller and faster the jackie. Seems hard to beleive? Watch the film. Those of who kickbox or like to watch it will be taken to school."
3,Cheesy plot but funny,"The movie has a simple cheesy love story plot --- the usual fairy tale ""rich guy-poor girl"" kind of thing. However, they have their funny moments. & of course, a Jackie Chan film will be incomplete if you don't show his talent in martial arts.I would say this is a much lighter & funnier version of the tearjerker movie ""Message in a Bottle"" (just kidding :-))"
1,"Rent It, IF YOU DARE","I purchased this DVD based on the other reviewers positive recomendations and I have to say, they are SO wrong. This has to the dumbest Jackie Chan movie ever. I have seen most of his movies and built up a respectable Jackie Chan movie collection and I only wish I had rented this movie first. Kudos to Brad Allen for his impressive moves, but if i ever meet him or Jackie in my life time, I will be asking one of them to refund my $20. If you want to pick up a good Romance-Boxing movie, go out and buy ROCKY. You've been warned."
1,Lousy Product,"It's way too easy to screw up the pull system for the wipes, so either nothing comes out or you get two or three. The top does not go on easily. But that's not the worst part. Using the product leaves the leather glossy and streaky unless you go over it again several times with a cotton cloth while it's still wet. There are many better products out there. I'm throwing the rest of mine away after two tries."
1,These are no good,"Got these wipes in hopes they would work well on my leather seats. I spent more time wiping off this crap then I did applying it. Looks awful, do not buy do not use."
5,Neil is at his best here!,"I think Neil Diamond is not given the recognition he deserves as a singer/artist. His voice is better than many more popular singers out there yet he is often overlooked. ""Hot August Night"" pulls together the best of his work and the fact that it's live adds an extra ""punch"".If you thought Neil's work was limited to ""You don't Bring Me Flowers"", think again. There's some great rock 'n roll on this album and you may find yourself surprised by the versatility of his voice."
2,Can't go back in time can we?,"I still haven't figured out why his chair doesn't listen to him but beside that I was hoping to find better sound quality (since it was ""remastered""). No chance. If you want to listen to this on your car radio (circa 1950's technology) you will be fine - anything better and you will come away with a head ache.Consider yourself warned. As I was listening to it I couldn't help but wish that Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs had gotten hold of not this - but rather the original Tap Root Manuscript LP recording and remastered it. That is THE Neil Diamond masterpiece (2nd side). That said - Soolaiman ? Brother Loves Traveling Salvation Show minus the Brother Loves poriton is awesome (again if you don't expect too much sound quality)."
5,Obsolute Classic,"Every music lover should own this album no matter what your musical preference is. My taste in music would be mainly ""hard driving"" rock,but still rate this album as an all time Classic.A favourite that brings on the goose bumps through excellent musician-ship by the Master and all his band(killer drumming too).Just try and prove me wrong."
3,Remaster but do not expand....,"Hot August Night is probably my favorite all-time album period. I completely wore out the cassette so I ordered the CD. The CD is ok but it is not the same as the original album as they have added several songs onto the CD that came out after the original. Some of these songs are, in my opinion, not typical Neil Diamond songs and really take away from the original. I actually was disappointed they saw fit to expand the original............."
5,BEASTS,"I found the book exciting and suspenseful. The characters felt real and alive to me. The author doesn't go on any long drawn out tangents, but gets to the meat of the story. I really enjoyed it!"
2,Dezo,"The size was listed 1-3, but too wide looking, the starp was too cheap , came off easly. I will be returning this pair again!"
4,Excellent product shipping too expensive,"I have used RainBirds dripline system for over 10 years and have learned two things; try to buy your parts from a Rainbird dealer since the quality is higher and these 1/2 inch Rainbird Barbed Couplings always work. Note, other 1/2 inch couplings never work :)I found the same coupler at [...] and shipping was only $3 versus $9 on Amazon.Good luck..."
3,"Decent, but could use some improvements","I was hoping this would be a little better quality with ""Professional"" in the name. But I think I'll be moving back to a traditional style cotton head mop. Everything on this mop is sturdy, the handle is great, and the sponge portion itself works good. But if you do any kind of real scrubbing by pushing down, after a while the plastic quarter-turn nuts that affix the sponge to the mop break. Thankfully replacement sponges come with new nuts."
3,Great float,"Not much to say, It works as advertised. I purchased this to add to my anchor line which I cast off to fight large fish. It keeps the anchor line afloat for retrieval after the fish has been landed."
3,Iron Review,"The instructions are complex, the iron requires too much maintenance, does not produce sufficient steam."
3,okay,"I use the iron everyday. Just tested 4 irons (shark, t-fal, a couple rowentas) in the 50-$120 range. This iron is okay except - it is worth another 10 bucks to get an iron that has anti-drip. This iron leaks ALOT of water unpredictably...I would say at least every other use. The steam is not the greatest, though not bad either... I would spend another 10 bucks on a rowenta."
3,"An ""OK"" Iron",When it's working this is a nice product. Reliability though is not it's strong suit. For the price we expected better quality and performance. We're on our second one now. Kind of makes me wish Whirlpool or Bunn made irons.
2,Not their best,I purchased this iron instead of the Rowenta I had looked at and now wish I had purchased. The T-Fal is OK but I believe I would have been much happier had I purchased the Rowenta.Sorry T-Fal but you need to try harder.
3,I needed a expandable handset,"I purchased this handset, because I had the base cordless and one other handset from panasonic. I loved them and figuered I would get another expandable handset for my sons room. I love it however the charge does not last as long as the other two I have. other than that it is a good phone as far as quality."
2,"Timekeeping great, but big problem with design","I received this watch 3 months ago as a birthday gift. Loved the watch, the features and look were great. Then this week, the plastic piece that is the bracket for the band broke off when I took it off. The plastic material it was made of appears to be substandard."
4,"Casio WVA104HA-1AB Casio Atomic, world Time Watch","This product was once sold by Hammacher Schlemmer until early last year (don't know why they did away with selling the product), however, I like the way the time stays accurate. The biggest drawback would be that if the watchband snapped after lots of wear and tear putting it on and taking it off (which happened to me that's why I purchased a replacement, it couldn't be replaced. Perhaps this model is discontinued."
1,disappointment,I bought this watch about a year ago. It was pretty convenient when I traveled and I loved the look on my wrist. Unfortunately it stopped walking about seven months after I bought it. Casio did repair it and it walked for another five month and Stopped again. caso is asking me to pay them to repair it again for the price I bought it 40$.
1,"Oh, please!!!","...The idea of the book in and of itself is plausible and poses some interesting qualities; it's the way the characters are written, shallow and unbelievable, and the typical format of a child changing everyone around him/her to such a degree as to be miraculous ..."
5,Love is a Blessing,"I too just loved this book! I wasn't expecting such beautiful prose from Anna Quindlan. This is my first venture into her novels. I am mostly familiar with her Newsweek writings.She wrote this story with such a tender perspective of a woman Lydia Blessing in her eighties who lived through all the stages of life...young to very old. Then as it seems by some miracle there came a change in her life with the hiring of a good man. A young and well intentioned fella who finds a baby left on her property. The baby, a little girl, is the center of love and hope within this story. Skip's love for her and awe in the newness of her life unfolding to the world all about her creates a ripple effect in his own world. I think Anna Quindlan gives light to the notion that we all rescue each other every day in many ways. Love is within us and all around us as we help, rescue, stumble, forgive, and make right each day."
1,A Blessing it was short.,"Page after page of waiting for something with substance to happen. (If you really want to read this, wait until it comes out in paperback.) Not what you would expect from Anna.It was very good at provoking impatience in the reader."
4,Worth Reading,"I am a fan of Ann Quindlen's books. This one confused me at times, but other than that I thought it was a wonderful story. I think that the story of Mrs. Blessing and the realtionship of Skip was very well written, however the flashbacks sort of confused me a little bit, cause they just flashbacked without starting a new chapter. But its worth reading. I also loved the book Object Lessons and Black and Blue."
3,Predictable but Sweet,"Outside of the fact that one wouldn't expect the handyman to find the baby, this book was predictable. The other reviewers who wanted it to end ""their way"" should have known better.I will admit it had a sweet, quiet current. It was an enjoyable, quick read."
1,Screwing up a good thing.,"Donnie Darko was one of my favorite films of all time... Until I saw the director's cut. To make this short, the DC took out ALL the good music and replaced it with other stuff which didn't even fit the scenes. Secondly, they added the ""scene titles"" which literally try to explain what's going on so you don't have to use your brain. In short, the DC killed everything that was unique and interesting about the film and made it into a film for the masses (just to make more money). If you really enjoyed Donnie Darko, don't watch this horrible version of it... go buy the original. And if you haven't seen the original, you're missing out."
3,GOOD BUT NOT HALF AS GOOD AS SOME PEOPLE HAVE YOU THINKNIG,"Good film, entertaining, although depressing.Acting is good and interesting.However this independent film, albeit the best I've seen in a while, is NOT HALF as amazing as some of these reviewers will have u thinking, and NOT HALF as DEEP as these people have you thinking.Hyped to muchh- this movie won't deliverMediocre review- Some will watch it and say hey its not that bad.If you give it a terrible review- most will like it because they won't consider it terrible.Not much replay value in this film if you ask me and I love many films. But the DVD is cheap and if you like these sort of films I recommend pickin it up or at least renting."
5,WOW - You'll either love it or not!,"Sorry Benjamin, I don't agree. Please believe the hype. But as one reviewer already said, ""You'll either love it or hate it."" And I loved this movie. As the review on the box says, ""It'll knock your socks off."" And it knocked mine into the next stratosphere. And the actor Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko) - WOW, WOW, WOW. This guy is off the charts GREAT. Even if you don't like the movie, you'll love him - guaranteed. Some big named actors could take some lessons from him :) And I got the soundtrack to the movie which is haunting and beautiful. This one I will watch many, many times. Oh, and one other thing, this is one of those movies where if you have to take a bathroom break (or whatever), stop the movie, because you need to see everything so that you won't be lost."
2,More pseudo-intellectuals,"I actually liked the movie a lot, but I get the impression that some people (read: stoned teenagers) try to find hidden meanings of things in the movie. I also fear that this was the intention of the director. God I hope not.I think it's an indication of under developed appreciation of art to have to add some sort of logic to things like this movie. Simple style and mood, hints at motivation, and bizarre imagery are fine on there own. They don't all have to tell a story. They don't even have to even represent anything at all.I'd give it 4 and a half stars but I'm going to try to offset the art school kids on this thing so I'll give it 2"
2,I think the director of this movie was drunk when he made it,"I purchased this movie based soley of the reviews that I read here on amazon.com. WHAT A DISSPPOINTMENT! I was expecting something that what leave me with something to think about afterwords. The only thing I could think about afterwords was that the writter of this movie wrote himself into a corner with the ""Frank"" character and did not have any idea how to explain Frank.The other reviews of this title have made it sound like something an interlectual would love. I currently have an IQ of 120 and I think you would have to be drunk or stoned to find this movie to be signifigant and full of meaning. I would have given this movie only one star, but the untouted appearnce of Maggie Gyllenhall (Jake's real life sister), the star of ""Secretary"" is worth at least on additional star."
5,Incredible in all aspects,"What an incredible movie. A great movie that I can't stop raving about to my friends. Granted - every movie has flaws - but this movie comes darn close to flawless. In my book - it's the king of ""psychological thrillers"". Once again - a MUST HAVE for anyone's collection. Believe the reviews - this movie is so fresh and entertaining. A twisty plot, a great cast, and a killer soundtrack make for an excellent film.Hands down - 5 stars."
5,Movie review,"Wow! Hauntingly beautiful and sad. Mysterious and deeply absorbing. Superbly choreagraphed, story, characters, and music all."
5,Donnie Darko's Greatness,"While watching this movie, you begin to ask your self ""when the hell will this movie pick-up"" This film hides its great sophistication. Its not till the movie ends that you realize just how wonderful this movie is.The story is about a delusional teen Donnie Darko(Jake Gyllenhaal) who sees a six foot tall bunny rabbit named Frank. Donnie is saved for some reason by Frank and is forced to do his bidding. Donnie goes through the film affecting charectars one way or another which all ties together in the end. The ending is one of the best film endings ever and is well worth whatching over and over.Jake Gyllenhaal gives a spectacular preformance he keeps his charectar restrained and makes you believe this guy is insane. The rest of the cast does an excellent Job.I expect great things in the future for writer/director Richard Kelly"
1,Pants........,"Let me add to that.....total pants! Judging by most of the other reviews, I believe I'd have to start partaking in illegal narcotics to like this movie, let's face it, something must be altering their minds to actually like this big steaming pile of bollocks!!! Decent soundtrack though, that's worth the one star!"
5,...speechless...,"Going to try to keep it short. My sister recommmed this movie to me. I went in blind, not knowing anything, coming out totally loving it. The first 10 minutes got in hooked. It was so amazing, I had to see it again with comentary because I just had to see/hear what Richard Kelly was thinking when he shot certain scenes. I couldn't stop talking about at work. My bf loved it but couldn't tell his coworkers cause, well, to be honest, they'd think he was weird, or think of me weird for finding intrest in such a movie. I hope you love it. One more thing, the 6 foot bunny. If you ever saw that standing in your path, you would pee your pants...I know I would."
4,Five Star Movie; One Star Commentary,"Only four stars. Don't get me wrong, Donnie Darko is one of the great films ever, and that's no exaggeration. And this Director's Cut is even better. Five stars plus. But the ""Director's Commentary"" extra is abysmal.For a movie that cries out for in-depth analysis by its visionary creator, the choice to have writer/director Richard Kelly be ""helped"" in his commentary by friend Kevin Smith is epically misguided. Self-centered Smith just won't shut up about his own movies, Mallrats, Dogma, and Clerks. Some may say these are fine movies, but I for one have no interest in how any scene in Donnie Darko is ""just like what I did in MY movie, Mallrats."" Kevin Smith, your movies aren't even in the same league. Richard Kelly can't seem to get a word in edgewise, and the result is an annoying and frustratingly unenlightening commentary.By all means watch Donnie Darko - The Director's Cut. Go to donniedarko.com for further info, but spare yourself the commentary on this DVD!"
2,Too weird for my taste,"After watching the movie Donnie Crapo, I mean, Darko, it seems more clear to me, why the minds of so many people are totally screwed up. Let's face it, the only reason why this movie deserves at least a two star rating is because of the awesome songs and fascinating musical arrangements. The rest of the film could be accurately filed under ""Garbage Productions""."
1,Horrible,"Just another boring movie that goth kids will pull-one off to. The pinnacle of pseudo intellectualism and kids who beg their parents to take them to Hot Topic, then pretend like they don't know them."
3,This is funny...,...cuz it was a gift for someone. I've never seen it myself...soooo...I can't tell you if it's good or not. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is good tho....U should hurry up and go catch it in theaters!
1,THIS IS NOT HIGH DEFINITION!!!!,"this is for those curious about the blu ray edition, first off, i love this movie and i owned the previous blu ray edition which was not in high defintion either so when i read about this and heard it actually was to be converted in true high definition this time, i was stoked and shelled out the mere $16 just to again find out its the exact same disc used as the previous ""blu ray"" edition. Sadly the only thing new to this package is the digital copy and a standard dvd copy...i wish i would have just kept my older copy, at least it had a cooler cover design"
5,"Good God, where to begin...","Donnie Darko is my absolute unquestioned movie of the year. I honestly do not believe that I have seen a more incredible movie in my lifetime. The acting was superb, the cast was wonderful, the plot was incredible, and it all came together to create what will no doubt be a cult classic forever. If you have any doubts about this movie, I can guarantee you, they will be erased upon viewing it. This movie is as close to perfect as you can get. Unforgettable."
3,Interesting sci-fi,"My 17 year old daughter loves this movie and bought the recently released directors cut. I'd only seen part of the original version, so this cut was my first full viewing.I can see how this film has acquired cult status, my daughter loves it and thinks it's much better than The Butterfly Effect, however, I didn't agree, I thought this flick was a bit disjointed.I would definately recommend watching this film if you're into this kind of film, it's certainly entertaining. Whether or not the film version or the directors cut is better, I'm not sure. But I do know I enjoyed watching the film and discussing some it with my kid.You'd probably have to be really into the story to want to buy this latest version, but if you're thinking of getting for a gift to the older teen, twenty-something set, you'll probably be doing ok."
5,This movie HAUNTS me...BRILLIANTLY DONE !,"I must say, I've seen this movie 4 times now and I still haven't completely figured it out. In fact, I've changed my perspective on this movie every time I see it. I've never experienced a movie so thought pervoking as 'Donnie Darko'. 'Equilibrium' has come close, but I figured that movie out the first time I watched it. I kept coming back to 'equilibrium' for the drama and the fantastic story line. 'Donnie Darko' had me waking up the next day thinking about it. Painfully wondering what I'd seen and what had happened. I suddenly found myself on a quest to understand this movie. It drew me in and I didn't even see it coming. It seemed like I was watching a normal movie, all the signs were there, but something hooked me in and I havent' been the same since. Seriously, be warned, this movie is addictive. I think that's why it's such a favorite of many reviewers. I highly recommend this movie and if you figure it out, please let me know...SERIOUSLY!!"
3,"Great for a serious collector, but lacking on anything new","I love collecting the FYE collectors tins, and the very rare Hot Topic ones as well. If I am mistaken this was a Hot Topic exclusive, but it could have been FYE too, don't recall, but it is out of print. Watch out for the Japan knock-off's. I bought this when it first came out, save the two disc collectors dvd which is inside the tin box shrink wrapped, and the sealed necklace, and the Tin, which is much better than lets say the flimsey tin that 10,000 BC and The Departed are in, this is more of a Tin Box, rather than the Tin Specials FYE usually releases.Great for a die hard fan or this movie or collecting, but other than that just a ploy to get more movie fans and cult fanatics into shelling out 20-40.00 to make them more money."
3,Stick with the original release,"Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie, but I felt the Director's Cut too long. I also was disappointed that the song, ""Under the Milky Way"" by the Church was removed from this version. Music plays such an important role in the movie and the Halloween party scene was ""limp"" because this song was taken out."
2,collapse,"It started out good and by the end of it, you keep looking at your watch, waiting for it to be over."
2,What is all the fuss about?,"I was hoping for something engaging and entertaining but that is not what I got. They should call it Donnie Dull. Sure the acting was good. The storyline was offbeat as well, but a good portion of it just did not keep me interested. I am personally getting pretty tired of movies where most of the characters are depressing. There were afew laughs but if I want laughs I will just watch the Marx Brothers. I doubt if I will recomend this to anyone. I kept looking at my watch wondering when it was going to end. It sure takes a long time to get to the point, but maybe that was the point?"
3,Way Out,"Even though I know that this is generally regarded as a ""classic"", I'd have to say that the story line was just too screwy for me to enjoy."
3,What The ?????..............,"wow. i have no clue as to the piont of this movie. it wasn't really scary, it wasn't funny, it wasn't action packed, and overall it made hardly any sense....MY KIND OF MOVIE !!!! this was the most screwed up, out there movie i've seen in a long time. Frank is the best part, though. it's sort of like a mix between Terminator, and bugs bunny,.....anyway i can't really explain it so you'll just have to watch it yourself!"
5,WoW WoW WoW - Must See! Highly Recommended!,I haven't seen a movie that I enjoyed this much in a long time! And it wasn't bloody or anything like that. I highly recommend this movie.
2,WTF ?,"OK...I was entertained but, this entire movie is really strange and then NO ENDING! :)Probably I should have given it more stars but, I hate movies that leave you hanging."
5,"A wonderful surprise, thought-provoking and well acted","Donnie Darko was a movie that I had wanted to see, but hadn't gone out of my way to do so. It was on late one night, and it certainly kept me up. This is one of those movies that, if you get it, will probably be one of your favorites, but if you don't get it, you won't like. It certainly is not frivolous and you have to watch the movie and pay attention, and probably will require multiple viewings to really see everything. That's ok because it's a wonderful movie, despite its dark overtones. The acting is top-rate from everyone and it was well cast and directed. If you like movies and aren't afraid to be challenged a bit, this comes very highly recommended."
3,"Alright, I kinda like this movie...",It's pretty good for the most part. But I like how flawed it is as well. I like flawed films. You will probably like it.
3,dvd,"i rated this a 3 because the quality and packaging was good but the movie was lame, very boring."
2,Good and bad. A slow discussion piece,"I can't say I loved, or even liked this movie right after I saw it. In my book it committed the cardinal sin of movies and dragged. Right in the middle it just seemed to be going slower than a dead snail on a salted sidewalk. It was extremely creative and imaginative, and defiantly one of those movies you will be discussing with friends after seeing it. The end really threw me. I didn't see it coming at all. Worth seeing, but not worth owning. And if you made it to the end, I would defiantly watch parts of it with the commentary on. It was really worth it to hear the makers of the film talk about their work, especial the last few scenes."
2,Just dont get it,Just cuz a movie is wierd and twisted doesnt mean it is necessarily good. I love twisted movies - that have a point. Whats the point of this movie? All my family and friends who say they love this movie cant even explain it to me. Its so good cuz of the cast. Oooo its so good cuz that bunny is so crazy. The colors are so cool. The soundtrack is really good. Thats all fine but none of that matters if the movie doesnt make sense. Is there some big statement about the state of the world? An observation about the power of love? Something about white american surburbia? Time travel? Schizophrenia? I dont get it. The whole movie is a just a countdown and then jake goes back and doesnt talk to the bunny so he dies. big deal. Events are altared. Wow. There s never been a movie about time travel where events in time are changed. Someone please explain this mess to me.
4,interesting reflection about life and death,"This movie is an interesting and provocative reflection about death and the role of death in our life. The actors go well and the script is well written. You can't predict what's going to happen in the next moment. This movie uses a non traditional form of story telling (I would say similar to David Lynch's style) trying to reach the unconcious.The reason I like this movie is because it has a point (I won't say what it is). And after my initial sadness of thinking of my own mortality, the movie actually made me feel better about myself and death. This is not just some weird movie that appeals to the wanna-bes of this world."
1,Don't Buy This,"This Movie Sucks. I don't recommend this movie to nobody. Only watch this movie if your having trouble sleeping. Donnie Darko should of been called Donnie boring cause that's what it is. The critics said it was nail biting, well they're right, I was biting my nails to keep myself entertained. Is It me or did this movie have 30 endings. Donnie Darko sounds like a SUPERHERO, but It was far from a SUPERMOVIE. Don't Rent It, Don't Buy It, Don't Try It."
2,"Alas, nothing new under the sun!","Someone on this board headlines their review: ""Remarkably original."" Well, hardly. Listening to the director's commentary, he credits a Twilight Zone episode as perhaps having inspired him. The episode mentioned is ""Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge."" While there is something to this comparison, the episode that ""Donnie Darko"" is virtually a twisted rip-off of is is a rather obscure episode written by Earl Hamner of ""The Waltons"" fame. The episode is called ""Ring-a-Ding Girl"" and is, in essence, the entire story of ""Donnie Darko"" told under half-an-hour, in a much more touching manner. And yes, there is even a jet crash in it and the ultimate sacrifice. But - watch the TZ episode and see for yourself. Just like ""The Sixth Sense"" was lifted from an old ""Thriller"" episode....alas, there is nothing new under the sun!"
5,Seed for a Parrot,This brand of bird seed is the best of what is out there. It contains no peanuts which can harbor mold nor does it have any sunflower seeds which make your bird fat. My birds love this seed. It is well worth ordering from Amazon. You will not find this classy seed in any pet store.
3,Just ok,Quality-wise this shirt is ok. When I read styled in Italy I expected it to be a little more fitted but it is really not. To me it feels somewhat baggy. The button or cuff option is a good addition too. For under $20 is very decent shirt.
1,"Terrible, Frustrating, Impossible","Do not buy this toy!!! I really would have liked to give this a ""zero"" star rating. My son received this as a Christmas gift and it has been the most frustrating project we have ever attempted. The machine is durable enough and fairly well constructed but it seems almost impossible to achieve success. We have made dozens of attempts to make the cars and have only been able to successfully complete one. The worst part is having to see how disappointed he is every time we open a mold to a failed attempt!"
1,Find something else to play with while you wait,There is not much fun in waiting for 15 minutes for crayons to melt and another 15 minutes for them to dry in the mold. The cars break apart easily after taking them out of the mold so you have to start the process all over again. At least you can make the time go by faster the second time by vacuuming up the small bits of wax off the floor from the first mold.
1,Spend a little more and buy something that actually works,"As soon as I received the product, I returned it. MS Paint probably works better than this junk. Pen does not work properly, you have to really press the pen hard on the surface to make it work and even then it works with a delay. You press it hard, after a few seconds something appears on the screen that might resemble what you actually intended to write. Maybe for drawing it might work if you press it hard but if you want to write with it forget it. Software that comes with it is clumsy and too simplistic, saving your work doesn't work most of the time and even if it did you are saving it on a pad that only works with their software, you can not save it on MSWord for example. My advice is, spend a little more and get something that actually works."
4,Who needs a Wacom...,"...when you can get a Genius for half the price? I will admit that the pricier ones are nice, but the genius tablet works great for only costing $50 bucks. It's smooth, you change the settings, though sometimes I wish I could make it a little more sensitive, that's the only thing that really bothers me about it. It always works, always senses the pen/mouse. And if you have vista, your computer will automatically recognize it so you don't even have to download the software.8x6 is the perfect size, not too small, not too big. It sits nicely on my desk without taking up too much room.It's great. Perfect for professional stuff or just for messing around. It's my new mouse for my laptop."
2,Fail,"I got this as a gift from my wonderful wife as a birthday present, God bless her soul...she had good intentions but man this thing a pain in the ace to setup! It took hours and many uninstall and reinstalls for my PC to recognize it.The worst part? It doesn't work with CS3 and up! It works fine with CS2, but if you want any pressure sensitivity at all in CS5, save your money and get something else. Hopefully these newer Geniuses I see are compatible, because not even the updated driver worked."
5,Wonderful device!,"This is my first tablet that I've ever had and the setup was extremely easy! It works with Microsoft Paint, Word, Adobe Photoshop 7 and a ton of other programs. This tablet has completely erased my use for a mouse. I am 100% satisfied with my purchase.However, when I open Word, it says that the macros have been disabled. Not that I mind, I don't use macros but the error box is really annoying."
1,"Didn't work, No support","I purchased this tablet a few days ago, and it is already on its way back to Amazon if that tells you anything. I was not able to get either of my systems to recognize this tablet. None of the websites listed in the documentation exist according to DNS, so I was not able to contact them for assistance. The documentation is written in broken english that is difficult at best to read and was not helpful resolving my problem.I'm going to give the wacom BambooBamboo (Small) Pen Tablet with Pen Onlya try and see if it works better. I guess if it works at all, that will be better."
3,good for starters,"This was my 1st graphics tablet. I bought it for myself just before my birthday. It worked really well and was very easy to use. I feel in love with it. The only problem is that randomly one day, (about 3 or so months later) it decided not to work anymore. I did travel with it a lot, and I think i accidentally ""frayed"" a wire. I had somebody look at it and that was it. Not as durable as I thought. Was taking it to and from college. Otherwize it is a really good product."
3,Couldn't get used to it,"My first tablet, to be used as a mouse replacement for ergo reasons. After 1 day I couldn't get used to it, (not easy to click unless pen is vertical which is not the way we normally hold pens; large size makes for too much arm motion; I never could figure out how to easily click the thumb-button) so I gave up. So it has not been useful for me, but I may not be a good data point."
2,Doesn't work with Mac OS,"After installing the tablet drivers for OS X 10.6, (this process itself didn't instill much confidence) the tablet failed to work. As another reviewer said, the light comes on for a brief moment, and then goes dead. The tablet never worked, which is a shame because of the potential value. I got a wacom bamboo and it worked immediately upon plugging it in.You'd think due to the large amount of gfx artists on macs, that they'd really nail down Mac OS support.One more note: the mouse provided with the tablet is cheap... super cheap. The wacom didn't come with one, so it is a bonus of sorts, but be warned, it feels like junk."
1,Shaky and Drifts,"This thing was great for a couple months. Has not been heavily used, but recently the cursor began shaking and drifting, which makes it unusable. Both the mouse and the pen suffer from this. I was hoping to get more than a couple months use out of it."
3,software poor,The software that interfaces the tablet to photoshop isn't very good. The eraser portion does not work at all. It does not function as a mouse so you must continually switch from the pen to the mouse for many functions. Not nearly as nice as the wacom but it was very cheap
2,Wacom Bamboo does it better,"I've been switching back and forth for a few months between this tablet and my beloved BambooWacom Bamboo Connect Pen Tablet (CTL470)and can honestly say that for a few dollars more, there is absolutely no comparison. The Wacom tablets are the standard of the industry for good reason, and even their lower priced offerings have the same wonderful touch and control as the more expensive versions.This tablet does work as stated, it will get the job done, and would be fine for a child to use, but the pen action is not as precise as Wacom's, the tablet has a few spots which are slightly dead (causes the pen to ""jump"" to a different spot on the screen), and the mouse is too lightweight and small to be comfortable for daily use.If you are thinking of buying this, do yourself a favor and look at what Wacom offers, even their cheapest tablet will outperform this one."
4,Works with Linux,"So far good. It works very well with Linux and I've been comfortably using it to scribble notes down for the past 7 days.I had used an older version of this product for a couple years, and I would suspect that it might not be very reliable in the long run, but it works for me.Once you get used to looking at the screen and writing on the tablet, which is not very difficult, this is a very cheap alternative to those expensive tablet PCs.I use xournal on Linux to take notes."
4,"Awesome Tablet for any drawing,painting,and etc","I really enjoy this product, I like to draw and this tablet really has help me. Overall I enjoy my purchase and I really like it ."
1,Genius MousePen 8X6 Graphic Tablet for Home and Office,"This product does not work properly.It says on the box ""Certified for Windows Vista"", but the true is, it only works with windows vista.The driver don't even run on windows xp. It doesn't even get installed.And if you try to contact genius, because all the drivers you downloaded didn't work, they will start a very stupid mailed-conversation, asking you the specification of your windows xp."
3,A pretty good product,"The instructions on how to open the pen to load the battery was no where to be found.Overall, it is a good product. It has been able to capture as I guide it around the tablet. I know many people like the smaller tablet. I like the big tablet size. It makes it feel like I am actually drawing on a piece of paper.If you are wanting to try using a mouse pen combo this is a good place to start."
2,"Terrible product, but at least they'll replace it endlessly","Everything was peachy for the first three months, and then it quit on me without warning. I called up the support team, and although it was a real pain in the ass to talk to someone, the representative was really helpful. Eventually I got a free replacement, and I was over the moon. I got to draw again!Unfortunately, that's not the end of the story. Before long, the new tablet crapped out on me, and I was forced to go through the process again. This time I felt that I had to be the one at fault, and asked what could have caused this. The representative was still happy to replace it, but was very unwilling to help troubleshoot.This time I treated my tablet like a vial of nitroglycerin. The amount of care and caution was ridiculous, and yet I got maybe 4 months out of it before having to get the replacement I'm using now.What the hell."
5,Another good product,"This tablet is fantastic; i love all the things it can do. It was such a wise choice to buy, and I'm glad for the low price. i wouldn't have another pc without one of these."
2,Genius Graphic Tablet,"I've used tablets before and asked for one for Christmas 2007, and this one worked great until June. The wire started getting a short in it, and you had to play around with it to make the computer recongize it. Finally, it just stopped working all together. I opened up the back to see that one of the white wire was exposed. I take care of my things, and I didn't hit it or bang it around. Who knows why it just stopped?"
3,Good and Bad,When it was working properly it worked awsome. I checked to make sure that all the drivers were updated and I changed the batteries right away and then one morning it just partially worked. Some parts of the pad would not work - there were some small areas that would quit working and wouldn't start working until you scribbled on the unit. I don't plan on doing anything professional either so I just figured that would be something I could use for the projects to get me started. Oh well I guess.
1,Too sensative!,I am going to return because it is too sensitive. The cursor moves even when you do not touch the pad!
5,Great service and product,Great service got delivered on time ..I was damaged but was sent a replacement right away Thanks-Thanks
3,Basic,"This is a very basic graphic tablet. I've used it a couple of times, it is something that takes time to get good at and enjoy."
2,Problems with pen,"The tablet works fine. So does the mouse that comes with it. The pen, however, will work for a little while then stop working. After a few minutes it will work fine. Five minutes later it quits again. Not happy."
2,"frustrating, waste of money","I brought this product last year, and i initially really liked it despite the fact that it felt a flimsy and cheap. It definitely got the job done, at least at first. There drivers aren't compatible with Vista 64-bit, but, hey, you can forgive that, because there is plenty of things that don't work with Vista 64. The hardware itself still worked, but the pressure sensitivity was lost on Vista.Futhermore, it shorted out.My suggestion is to go with the wacom bamboo, which has a better reputation."
3,not my favorite by this author,"This one was hard for me to really get into, mostly due to a near-total lack of likeable characters. On the other hand, it was much more enjoyable than the author's ""Cities of the Flesh"", which has the most annoying punctuation- way too many and lengthy (......) plus the most shallow and unpleasant characters I've seen in a long time. It's a bad sign when you find yourself rooting for the bad guys because the good guys are such a pain in the neck."
5,Excellent Music!,"Amazing CD! Very soulful, funky,laid back and REAL to the Brazilian experience. Everyone I've given this CD to enjoys it, even non-Portuguese speaking people. If you understand Portuguese, it adds to your experience since Nativus gets political as well."
5,Impressive. Most Impressive...,"Well, I'm original Little Mermaid child from 1990 and I can tell you, the music on this CD is absolutely wonderful. It's definatly not as good as the original, but ""Down To The Sea"" and ""For A Moment"" have the same effect on me that ""Part of Your World"" did from the original: I can't stop singing! Beautiful job on the soundrack, movie was a bit dissapointing, but that's another review ^_~"
5,A must gift for any Green Bay Packer fan!,I purchased this CD for the purpose of listening to highlights of past great Packer games. I have been a fan of the Green Bay Packers since 1971. I play this CD at tailgate parties and I always draw a crowd. Fans love to hear the play by plays of past games. This CD really pumps the blood through the veins! I recommend it to any and all Packer fans! Go Pack Go!
4,Nice turtle-quarium addition,"This is a nice, scenic addition to my turtle aquarium and has plenty of flow and filtration for my needs. The only thing, my baby sliders have a hard time climbing up the sheer face to get to the basking platform. It usually takes them several tries. You can't raise the water level past a certain point, so you have to provide a ramp or some other lower place to get out of the water. I bought the 12-pack filter kit to save money because believe me, they fill up quickly."
3,My Feelings on the Filter...,"...Meh!I've used this filter for 1.5 years and it's just OK.Pros:Cute decorationWhisper-quietSurprisingly keeps my 40gal tank cleanCons:Waterfall is much too steep for my 9in yellow-bellied slider to climb, so can't be used as a basking areaRequires the water level to be incredibly low, leaving my swimming space (took multiple trips to Lowes to buy planters to place under the filter to increase water level)Cartridges are rather expensiveNeeds to be cleaned and de-gunked very frequentlyOverall, may be great for smaller turtles, but my full-grown turtle needs a filter that will allow ample swimming space, and maybe doesn't need to be cleaned as often."
5,Exactly what I was looking for,"This fountain looks nice, has 2 filters to help keep the water super clean, and is affordable. It shipped quickly and arrived as expected. It runs very quietly and works well while providing a nice looking water feature for my critters to enjoy."
1,Dead wire,"I've used Live Wire for years but lately get the feeling their parts are flimsier, their quality control poorer... I bought two of these and the tips on one fell apart after 3 uses. Because I live outside the US I can't take them up on their lifetime replacement offer and I'm just pissed off... especially if my only recourse is a WAY TOO EXPENSIVE Monster cable."
5,"A very good price, and a very good item!!!",fits the zen perfectlygood screen protectorsnot bulkymuch better than theleather case!!!
2,Too much lifeless dialogue and not enough action,"As usual, the powerful female figures on the front of the DVD got to me. First, I watched all of the OVAs. They disappointed me so bad I ended up sellign the whole tape. Then I bought the manga, and I thought it was decent. Then comes the movie. I will agree that the animation was excellent and the effects they used were amazing, but the content of all of it suffered. I'm going to give the series one last chance: I'll soon buy the mini-specials. Get Dirty Pair: Project Eden instead."
1,Ugh,"Although the premise is interesting, Wright did not do justice to his own idea. The story is slow-moving and totally unbelievable. It's as if the author knew the outcome of his novel and had to go back and fill in the blanks, regardless of how senseless this makes the story seem. Furthermore, the character's (or is it the author's?) machismo is displayed on about every other page, and this rapidly becomes irritating. I regretted that I had spent the money on this book."
1,What a waste,"What a waste of a great idea! The story doesn't really go anyhere, the science is vague yet still unbelievable, the romance is dull and the journal style used by the author falls apart on more than one occasion. For some reason it reminded me of the Planet of the Apes TV series. It is a book for adults with a plot that young children could find fault with. My advice is to read something else."
3,CUTIE PIE,This is a cute book with very colorful illustrations.The farmer and his wife get some animals and have a nice time. THE ANIMALS ARE BROUGHT BY BOAT FROM THE WILD. Who wouldn't want to live at this cozy little wooden farm. This review refers to the 1968 hardcover edition. anilmals sounds repeated.
5,OLD SCHOOL MUSIC NEVER GOES OUT OF STYLE!,"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST OLD SCHOOL CDS OUT THERE!! THE VOICES, THE INSTRUMENTS, AND MICHAEL COOPER MAKES THIS CD WORTH PUTTING ON REPEAT FOR AN ENTIRE DAY! WHEN MY 3 YEAR OLD GRANDSON IS SAYING ""GRANDMA I LIKE THIS SONG(LOVE'S TRAIN)!"" YOU KNOW IT'S BOMB! LOL!!"
4,Enjoyable Bond,"My great disappointment with the movies has been the way the originals have been treated. The early movies, Dr. No, From Russia With love and maybe Goldfinger were reasonably respectful treatments from the source. Casino Royale proved that they could be made successfully with minimal gadgetry or any sci fi aspect. 'From Russia' had a booby trapped attaché case with a gun in it!I often wondered why they made 'Dr No' before 'From Russia With Love', in the books Russia precedes No. In Dr No reference is made to an enemy agent almost killing Bond because his gun jammed so they supply a new one. The agent who almost kills him is Rosa Klebb at the end of From Russia. My theory is, why not start all over again? Casino Royale has started off well,ignore Quantum, Skyfall. But now remake them all, in chronological order. Without the gimmicks and gadgets. They wouldn't really be remakes anyway, most of the films were nothing like the original stories. Just saying."
5,Excellent book,I love it. I am a big fan of the entire James Bond series. I think I have watched all the movies at least a dozen times. The books don't dissappoint.
3,Interesting to read!,"This is a fairly decent book, a good bit of quilting history and a must if you have a large library and are interested in quilting. There are, however, no patterns, and it's mostly just for reference. The pictures are black and white, but there are some wonderful quilts featured. Good book for a quilting history buff."
5,NGE Fan,I love this collection in fact i always purchase the dvd from amazon they have great deals on their anime dvd.
4,No Closed Captioning for Deaf or Hard of Hearing fans,"(This review is for deaf and hard of hearing fans only)This is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. Other than that, plain subtitles is pretty good, better than most. The picture is beautiful, and a lot less shaky picture in compare to non-platinum collection. I enjoyed it and am proud to have it in my anime collection."
5,My fav all time anime...,"You have to be a fan to appreciate this set... Though the ending is bad on this particular set (only because the other ending is not included) I enjoyed it. Maybe I am bias? Love the packaging, Love the small dvd cases, love the anime."
1,I want to write review but amazon.com canceled my order w/o notice,I have seen that gimmick from some other websites when they made the price error. but Amazon.com? It was pretty shocking when I discovered amazon.com took out my order for this dvd set without notice and pretended nothing ever happend. i am really disappointed.
4,"Great book, good food, pretty pictures ...","Never mind the reviewer who said that this book is poorly organized. Indian cookery revolves around pastes and mixtures of spices and rather than repeating these procedures time and time again in every recipe they are separated out into a great section that deals with the spices and sauces common to many Indian foods. This is a great primer for people unfamiliar with cooking Indian foods and a broad and useful book for those of us experienced but maybe getting bored of cooking the same old foods time and time again.My mother, nearly sixty years old, Indian and cooking curries her entire adult life spent hours pouring over this book and so I bought my second copy as a present for her and she loves it.My failure to give this five stars is only because I own an old Penguin Paperback called Indian Cookery (Dharmamjit Singh) which I regard to be the holy grail of Indian Cookery books.Indian Cookery (Penguin handbooks)."
1,"If I could rate zero stars, I would.","I HATE tracfone with GOOD REASON. They suck!!! Just today I tried to buy min and guess what? They both double-charged my credit card AND I have no minutes! Woohoo, they SUCK! It's so hard to understand their customer representatives, most live in South America (nice place, nice people, but THICK accents. How am I supposed to understand them??). Avoid this company - I plan to leave them!!"
5,By far the most used cookbook in my house.,"Quick and Healthy Recipes and Ideas contains easy-to-follow, healthful recipes that your family will actually eat."
3,It is ok I guess,The book is not what I expected. It does not give you much information in the recipes. It seems someone put it together in a hurry.
2,Awfully bland,"The concept is a good one but the recipes aren't tasty. I cook quite a bit and was looking for one cook book I knew would be quick and easy- this isn't it. Some of the recipes are not what I consider healthy - due to fat grams, calories as well as suggestions for buying prepackaged/prepared food (that is no where near healthy in my opinion)."
2,newbies to healthy cooking MIGHT find the book helpful,"This book and the second volume were two of the first books I purchased when I first decided to make cooking healthy part of my daily life. They are very simple, and for a person with practically no kitchen experience, much less experience with healthy cooking, these books may make a decent primer.However, she does call for a LOT of processed foods. The sodium content in most of the dishes is insane. Many of the recipes are so basic that even the inexperienced cook might feel insulted that they were included in the volume. There are at best a half dozen recipes in volume 1, and NONE in volume 2 that I currently use. My need for healthy cooking goes far beyond what little she offers.Unless you are a brand new cook with limited resources who just wants to get your feet wet with healthy cooking, I would recommend against purchasing this book."
5,Daughter LOVES this book,"This is one of the few books my avid reader has taken the time to read more than once. It is a shame that this compelling story is out of print. I believe that this tale, which follows the life and times of a young orca, will help readers appreciate wild whales and other marine animals in our oceans without sappy fictional accounts. The main character definitely faces the challenges of living in the wild, so please keep that in mind if giving to a young child. However, even my fairly sensitive daughter (she was probably 8 or 9 when she first read it) enjoyed this as she has seen many nature documentaries and understood the food chain and inherent perils within the natural world. We stumbled upon a tattered paperback at a used book sale and after a couple of readings had to replace it with a hardback as this is definitely a keeper! Perhaps this will become readily available again.Update: Almost 14 yr old avid reader STILL raves about this book and the outstanding writing."
2,"ANCIENT AUDIO, BUY THE 2007 REMASTER INSTEAD","In 2007, Universal UK released a 2CD set,Gold, that is actually Addictions Volumes 1 & 2 remastered.The original Addictions CD's are well over 15 years old, and completely out-of-date, from an audio-quality perspective.The remastered sound is great; all RP fans should divest the older discs and get the Gold set."
5,St. Sargent charcoal drawings,"This book is worth much more than what you'll pay for it! These masterful portraits are beautiful, simple, personal. Executed with fluidity and rapidity, the people captured here practically breathe within the pages of this book. Every artist can learn something about Sargent's quiet intimacy here."
5,Good quality,It's really happy to receive such book. It's handy with good quality and reasonable price. Good to recommend to others.
2,Just for Decoration,"This bellows is far too small and far too chintzy to actually use. It's fine if you just want a fashion accessory for your fireplace, but it's cheaply made and really does NOT push enough air to get even the smallest fire going."
5,This is my first Bellow,If you are looking for a moderately priced bellow I do believe you will be happy with this one. Although it may small it really does the job for me just fine.
4,glad to find one,"came on time, seems to work fine, looking to try it in the cold in a couple weeks or so"
3,"I liked the book in the beginning, then it got boring...","When I first started reading the book, it seemed really cool. After all, Sabrina got to be a mermaid and try to save the city of Atlantis. Then it began to get really boring and I found myself skipping pages, and sometimes chapters. If you really want to get a good book from this series, get ""Eight Spells A Week"", that books the best."
1,The new Queen Of Bad Singing,The worst thing to happen to adult popular music since Barbara Streisand. Mouskouri's clumsy phrasing and lack of swing make her unbearable.
5,The best female voice of this century.,"I have Concert for Peace and Falling in Love Again on CD. Return to Romance, and Only Love on cassette, so I must now buy these also on CD. The most beautiful touching song she sings is ""Even Now"". If more radio stations played her songs so that people would get to know her voice, her CD's would outsell even Celine Dion and Whitney Houston!"
3,not for one who can read armenian,"well, for those who only speak Armenian, this is an extremely helpful book. But if you can read the Armenian language, stay away. You'll be frustrated by the ""mix up"" of the different T's, P's, K's, etc. Although this book does have quite a few ""modern"" words that other dictionaries lack, it is not helpful for those pursuing scholarly activities."
3,Took longer than expected,"I ordered 3 books from independent dealers--two were delivered within a few days, but this book took longer than expected. However, it was in good shape when I received it."
3,Kind of Boring,"I saw Sizzla at The Ark this summer and he gave a great performance, better than the ones he gives on EITHER of the discs that make up this album. I own all of Sizzla's albums but I find this one kind of boring and repetitive. Just because his message is good doesn't mean the method is great. I'm ""in the know"" and I STILL agree with the reviewer."
1,you have got to be kidding me,"this product was a size of a chap stick, and had only one use. I am so disappointed, what a waste of money."
1,Disappointed!,It does not work. I had razor burn and it made it itch more and more. It was a complete waste of money.
1,That's terrible,I have hair on my face and I had hopes this product would help me. What a nuisance. It just dried my skin and made me waste money!!!!
5,It's Re-Release Is Just Great! Better Than I Thought,"Positiva Records is celebrating their tenth anniversary by re-releasing their CD singles like Binary Finary's ""1998"", Alice Deejay's ""Better Off Alone"", DJ Sakin & Friends' ""Protect Your Mind"", and other songs with all new remixes.I thought I was gonna put in three stars, but it turned out a lot better than I thought. Tracks 1 & 2 are the Radio Edit (3:35), and the Original Mix (7:03). The remixes in the CD single are the Ronald Van Gelderen Remix (8:55), the Kenny Hayes Remix (7:46), and the Origin Remix (9:20).I would have to say that this is the ""flawless"" CD single. I feel so glad I bought it, I'm buying more re-released CD singles from Positiva."
3,"Interesting topic, irritating author","While the topic of taking young children on a long distance hike is interesting, and the author knows how to write, you quickly get the feeling that she would be an insufferable if she worked in the cubicle next to you."
3,Waiting for a REAL Marc Almond Greatest Hits....,"This collection is anything but complete (where are all the tracks from his solo albums from 1984 to 1987???), there are not all the Soft Cell hits, and most of the tracks are remixed versions, so I would recommend to buy the original albums instead. ""I Feel Love"" is a bad track, and I can't understand why there is a 12"" mix of ""Say Hello Wave Goodbye '91""... I would have preferred ""Stories Of Johnny"", ""Love Letter"", ""Tenderness Is A Weakness"", ""Melancholy Rose"", ""Black Heart"" (from the brilliant Marc And The Mambas release ""Torment And Toreros"") and ""Only The Moment"". Waiting for a real Greatest Hits collection, I'm not very satisfied with this one, althought it contains many strong tracks like ""Something's Gotten Hold Of My Heart"" with Gene Pitney and a very good remix of ""Memorabilia"" (much better than the original)."
3,Dated romance,"Even the chateau and grounds of Versailles have gone through enough changes for good and bad in the last 45 or so years to make this publication be dated. Still, it is an ode to the palace and its statues and fountains to make for an enjoyable enough reading excursion. I would not say that this benign Audrey Hepburn era book is especially remarkable. A reader can resource a plethora of more recent and intriguing publications surrounding the vast subject of Versailles. But I'll keep my copy of this square format book since its worth so much more than the fraction of the price I paid for it at a used book sale this year. A pleasant distraction at best."
4,Great follow up from a great band!,"I was verrrry pleased to hear that Zebrahead stuck to the same formula that made 'Waste of Mind' a killer CD to listen to. Particularly 'I'm Money' and 'I am' stand out, as well as the title track, 'Playmate of the Year'. These guys are amazing live and everything they record is tight and infectious to listen to. This CD won't be leaving my CD player for quite some time!!"
3,PLAYMATE OF THE YEAR,This cd isnt as good as thier first one. It's ok but i wouldnt really recomend it unless your a big fan. It has a punk sound to it.Only good song on it is ( Playmate of the year) other than that song the rest are so-so.I would skip buyin this one.
4,Review for American Dad vol. 2,The DVD was wonderful. Very entertaining and funny. The amount of shows contained in this volume is great. There is enough material to keep you entertained for hours.
4,An engaging challenge to traditional ideas of alien life.,"We take an enjoyable and memorable journey with an astronaut researcher searching for life beyond Earth. His first encounter with an alien species is hilarious at times. This lasts only temporarily, as the aliens soon present intriguing ideas about how immense and common other life is. The story concludes in grand fashion, as the main character discovers other life beyond anything he could have imagined. There are few dull moments, as we try to figure out just where we're headed. The answer is simple and easy to accept in the end, but is still fascinating and intriguing."
1,Worthless piece of plastic,"Very disappointed in this lousy piece of bent, cheap, plastic. Don't waste your money, it is very overpriced for the quality."
4,It would have been 5 stars...,"I couldn't do it. I loved the first series of Black Books. This second series just didn't measure up. I felt that Bernard Black's anger was diminished, which for me provided most of my enjoyment of the character. I also felt that they were trying to give each of the stars equal time. This just caused the episodes to fall flat. I expected more, and perhaps that's why I was disappointed. Two of the episodes came close to capturing the last series spark, but the rest just left me bored. It's still a great series, I just can't recommend this as highly as the first."
5,You said we'd never mention Canada!!!,"Dylan Moran is brilliant. The perfect antidote to those oh, so perfect american sitcoms filled with bright and shiny people. You know, the ones with impossibly white teeth who never look rumpled or stinky or real. Moving walls, thongs, and summertime girlfriends...this one's got it all. You will need your pause button as you'll laugh right through the next jokes!"
2,very wordy despite the length,"Billy Budd, a story set in the sea is said to be one of the best short books of all time. The truth, is that the number of pages has no reflection on the length of this very hard to get through story of jealousy. I am inclined to say that for those of you who are forced to read this as I was, should seriously consider buying cliff notes and renting the movie. My candid opinion is this: Billy Budd is just a mess of words thrown together and it is a shame it had to be written by the same author of the classic Moby Dick."
1,Better hire a translater for this one...,"Because it was written as if it were from another planet. It must have had a decent moral in it, but you'd need someone who reads these for a living to tell you. You can tell a book is hard to read when even the cliffs notes make no sense! I'm sure that it had a good story, but I couldn't find it. Unless you can understand this stuff, I wouldn't suggest it. If you want to read it, I can only say, good luck."
3,A little dissapointment,Comming from Patrick McCarthy I expected a more elaborated work. I bought the book like most of the others assuming that there will be new or at least information related with Kobudo or in the other case important information about Karate or other Okinawan martial arts. This is not the case with this book. Although interesting it is not an outstanding job. It is a good addition to your libary specially if you are interested in expanding your vision about Okinawan martial arts.
5,Martial Arts History,"It is hard to find accurate information on the history of the Martial Arts. Everyone has a slightly different slant on what they know or want you to know. However, this book has some profound information in it. I am not sure that any work of history can be without bias or simply have details lost in time but this book reveals some truths that are hard to ignore or refute. A little dry if you are looking for a book with action sequences but if you want to know how we got where we are today in Karate this book is a must read.The author has spent many years studying the martial arts, both as a scholar and a warrior. His dedication to this search for truth shows in this book.Nicholas Guinn5th Degree Black Belt - Aikijutsu4th Degree Black Belt - Shotokan KarateGuinnMartialArts.com"
1,Hhhhhmmmmmm...........................,"Nicely designed cover,but the rest,well a nice list of names and dates,too many pictures of maccarthy himself.I expexted a little more from someone with a reputation like mccarthy`s.Not very interesting except for the serious historian.There are a lot of pictures of kobudo sequances but no applications so whats the use in that?Somebody that has never practised the forms shown in this book would gain nothing from it.For the general reader look elsewhere as this is not useful unless you are seriously interested in history."
1,There is no Santa Claus.,"Evolution is supported by mountains and mountains of documented, irrefutable evidence from educated, professional, intelligent people who have simply followed the course of where their research took them. It's no longer about one guy who wrote one book in the mid-1800's. Not any more. Inform yourselves, people. I challenge anyone reading this to actually investigate how much supporting research there is out there for evolution in science, in astronomy, biology geology and physics. It's overwhelming. Check out some web sites from some universities and research institutes to get an idea of how research is being done on evolution all over the world. Do you think they're all in a conspiracy, and that they're just making it all up?"
2,somewhat disappointing,I bought this game for my nephew as a Christmas gift and we took it on a ski trip for everyone to play. All of us were disappointed in the format in that each team plays for a lengthy stretch of time while the other team just sits. Plus the music seemed like studio or elevator remixes with other intro music all around it making it difficult/inaccurate to guess the answers. There were a dozen of us playing and we all much prefer the Shout About games ~ they need to do a vol. 3 for music.
5,Stone Cold,"This is the best that hardcore country music can get. Real Old-Fashioned Broken Heart, I Buy Her Roses, Every Third Monday, and the unmatched Yard Sale are some of the best sad songs I've ever heard. Don't Go Near the Water, Cadillac Style, and Anywhere But Here are more upbeat. Harbor for a Lonely Heart is a beautiful song. There isn't a single bad song on the album.Sammy sounds like George Jones, and these songs are definitely up George's alley, but Sammy is still pretty unique. I've never heard a traditional country album that sounds like this one in terms of production and song quality. Sammy rules!"
1,Very Unhappy In Alabama,"This CD is unplayable,seller stated ""used very good condition""thats not true,I will never purchase from this seller again,you need to say CD skips and has scrathes on it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"This book teaches Visual Cafe, not Java","This book seems to assume you know some Java, and is a good resource for an overview of the features of Visual Cafe. It _does_ have an overview of Java, but not to the detail that I, a new learner, need. To learn Java itself, read Dietel & Deitel's book. Now THATS detail! ......Im glad I bought Visual Cafe Frontrunner."
5,Pleased with Tiger,"I always dread the updates on my computer, because it's Murphy's Law for me. Something always goes wrong. However, I was very pleased with Tiger. I followed the instructions and installed it without a hitch. I'm thrilled with the new ""goodies"", too. I like Dashboard that allows me to check up on the weather, time, and other options at the click of a button. I use the dictionary and calculator often, because they are so easy to access. Mac did a nice job on Tiger 10.4.6."
4,A literary staple,"Not only a must-have for Brautigan fans, but I believe, a novel that should be present on the bedside bookshelves of all. Great characters, and Brautigan is at his best when he goes off on little tangents or flashbacks. This book has one of my personal favorite such allusions, that being one refering to a comic book hero called 'the mound' (this is not the correct name, for it has been some time since I read the book, but you get the idea), which was this hero who never did anything particularly heroic, just kind of slothed around in a 'mound-ish way."
1,Big disappointment,This is not a serious design tool. The program is very limited. If you are only going to design square or retangular rooms (the program restricts you to these options) - it might serve some basic needs - otherwise I would not recommend it. Tried contacting the company for further assistance - got no response.
1,Not worth your time or money!,"This software is very unfriendly. You can't delete windows once they are in place. The 3D rendering doesn't work, either. I have windows ""floating"" in mid-air in the middle of my virtual kitchen!"
4,Imperial Life in the Emerald City,"This is a 'must-read' history/current-affairs for those who want to understand our situation in Iraq. No one book says it all, but this gets you started."
4,Maybe this book will also be made into a comedy?,"The book is helpful for understanding why Iraq is a disaster. However, you can also wait for the movie version, which could be made as a comedy. I was surprised that Charlie Wilson's War was made into a comedy (though the book has funny moment). Guess funding the moujahadeen is funny, as long as it is in the past. In a similar vein, this book depicts the ancient history of 2003-2004 (and has some very funny moments). Maybe in retrospect the Iraq war can also be depicted as ""funny"". Haha!"
1,More of a craft item,"I bought a couple sizes of the Milestone forms for use in cement stepping stones. They are probably fine for craft projects for church camp or such, but for the items I make, they are not heavy duty enough. They are made of a rather thin clear plastic, comparable to the blister packaging of, say, batteries, for instance. Altho the thicker mil black forms are a bit pricier, they are worth the money: strong & durable for multiple uses. Cement step stones should be about 2"" thick, these are not very deep. Additionally, the ""brick-size"" form I bought had some ""crimps"" in 2 of the corners. Portland cement when cured properly, shows every mark or indentation in the original mold. I ended up tacking mine over the electrical outlet near the sink in my work area..."
3,Good Effort!!,"Al Dimeola absolutely dazzles me with his guitar playing, preferrably with the 70's fusion jazz group, ""Return to Forever"". There are a few songs that are outstanding on this album. ""Arabella"" is really an outstanding piece of work with its guitar arrangement and production value. ""Smile from a Stranger"" is another highlight on this album with its haunting melody. Unfortunately, that's about it on this album. I really thought it was up and down for me. But it still a good effort!"
5,Sheer Joy,"The nineteenth century British clergyman Sydney Smith said that one idea of heaven was eating foie gras to the sound of trumpets.He predicted Jazz In Marciac and Wynton Marsalis's ""Marciac Suite"".A technically complex and brilliantly executed composition which overflows with joie de vivre, romanticism and optimism.Just listen and enjoy."
2,Rufus King is Just What You Need,"The songs I loved in the movie were not the ones that ended up on the soundtrack. This CD is a collection of JockJams, without great songs by Sum41 and Mest that you hear in the movies. I was really looking for the song ""Just What I Need"" that is written for Torrance in the movie. ..."
3,Good Cd,It was a great cd if you like pop/r&b dance music. It dissapointed me because i was looking for the song that cliff wrote torrence. i like that song ALOT and have gone crazy trying to find it. no luck so if you want to by this cd it doesnt have it on it! it was a good cd though.
1,Meh.,"Basically, I think they sold out on this soundtrack. Alot of the songs that are prominently featured throughout the movie are missing (for example, Sum 41's Makes No Difference, Mest's What's The Dillio, Bis' Detour (Do You Wanna Go My Way?)) and instead, we find alot of songs of which we simply hear clips of during the competition mixes. Now, if they had actually featured the mixes in their entirety, it would be different. But instead we are left with a bunch of, quite honestly, mediocre songs."
1,Defective and warranty not supported by Sony,"The unit is a great idea, but either has a poor design or my unit was defective. It failed outside of 30 days, so I called Sony. After a lot of time on this, they finally said that they would eventually (no time line) replace it if I paid $15 to send it to Texas. After chatting with second level support, it seems clear that there is no good process from Sony US to support warranty on small items.So, if you buy this, be prepared to throw it away if it has the same defect. Or, look for another brand, which probably means not using Amazon."
1,Ghosting and color glitches,"I purchased this cable because the hdtv/tv selector switch on my original cable failed. I had to tear the old cable apart and rig the selector switch. Once i did that the original cable worked perfectly, but i figured i should get a new one on the way.I ordered this type instead if the microsoft cable because it was cheaper and looks like a better cable. This is one of those times that looks can be decieving.With this cable i get ghosting and color glitches that are not there with the microsoft cable.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM. BUY THE MICROSOFT CABLE, IT WORKS, THIS ONE DOESN'T."
2,Review for III,"I was disapointed in this movie. I had to make myself stay with it. My husband watched about 30 mins of it and then left the room. It did not live up to Saw I and II, which I liked very much. I think there will be a IV and I will watch it."
3,THIS *SAW III* IS NOT THAT SHARP !!!,"U know the first SAW, was SCARY and SHOCKING in the end, Frezz me & people in the chair End of ""SAW"" in the theater!! Everyone loved it & shocked! Well everyone I know, I guess just hit the spot.! ""SAW 2"" was good, I liked it too, But not like the first SAW, But this SAW 3 is kind of looks like a lots flash backs and getting little lame and drama type the flick, I guess really wasn't all that like first saw & saw2, A bit downfall to me. The ""SAW"" series is kind of like ""HOSTEL"" scrip. Well ""HOSTEL 2"" going to release in theaters soon, Hope they NOT going to screw it up like they did with this SAW3!!I bought first SAW & 2 on DVD ...But this ""SAW3"" is ok rental instead to Buy!! C+"
3,good movie for the saw francise,"this was a good movies and if you like saw 1 and 2 then you would like this one also, just more of the cuts and gore and the riddles. just a good addition to the francise and worh buying."
3,Like watching Leave It To Beaver,"Watching the two guys in this movie was like watching Eddie Haskell and Wally Cleaver in Leave It To Beaver. LITB was better, though, because the conversations were natural and unforced. This movie left me with the impression that a group of comedy writers wrote the script and these guys simply mouthed it. Nobody -- I repeat, nobody -- is capable of retorting with such sharp responses so quickly as these guys were doing. The think time between one guy's statement and the next guy's response was in the sub-second range. Also, the humor was juvenile -- not very sophisticated, with a false sense of erudition on the part of Eddie Haskell."
1,Huh?,"In an attempt to ""identify"" with the hip '90s generation, this film fails to cover the bases of a sound script, a good delivery by competent actors, and above all, a somewhat believable premise. I was amazed to see none of these while suffering through this one. However, I faintly picked up a glimpse of a good idea toward the end, but by then it was too late. Neat camera angles and a picture devoid of color, while intriguing at first, do not make up for this film's shortcomings (Hey, I just memorized this amazingly long monologue or I guess you'd call it a run-on sentence ten minutes ago and I think I can spit it out and remember to use words like ""self-nullifying"" and others that I would normally not EVER use in a normal conversation)."
2,What's the big deal?,"I saw this on cable. It was mildly amusing. I was able to pass the time pleasantly for 2 hours watching ""Clerks"". But I really can not understand why anyone would think it was a great movie or hilarious. Jay and Silent Bob were much funnier in ""Dogma"". I also could not understand why any young woman would consider the main character serious boyfriend material. All the characters except maybe the lasagne girl are losers."
5,This movie is a 20 something Seinfeld with a kick.,"A bunch of 20 something kids in dead end jobs attempt to build themselves up, and create a sense of self worth. This day in the life picture is something that stands out to people of that age.As you look at the way Kevin Smith put all of this together it is very obvious that there were items of interelatedness to it all. He has created themes and stuck to them so there is obvious continuity.The humor was great, and the premise was strong. The swearing was a bit much, but it was real. All in all this is a great film to see even if it is just so that you can see what life is like for a bunch of bored kids."
5,Hilarious - Uncut,"This is in my top 5 movies EVER. Clerks is the epitome of funny. Silent Bob created a masterpiece while only spending around $30,000. This is one of the 3 best comedies of the 90s (alongside Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary) The only thing I could say about this DVD is to buy now, or be sorry later."
4,"A film of note, a genre in its own right","Very enjoyable comedy and a new way of watching a film. Somewhat voyeuristic... you kinda feel like you're covertly watching these people via a closed-circuit television. Considering that this film was made for less than $30K, I can't imagine how little these fabulous actors were paid for their roles.You don't feel like you're watching performers, but real people experiencing the weird things that happen in life... just in one little store.This is a must-see film for budding film-makers and film aficianados. You don't need a lot of money or endless resources for a good film... just a good story, a good screenplay and real down-to-earth characters. Life is often much stranger than fiction and this film shows how funny people in their own environment can really be. A great film for people-watchers and anthropologists.... and just plain funny."
5,HD offers improvment despite original source material.,"I know a lot of you are thinking ""hey! Wasn't this movie grainy and kinda bad looking on dvd!"", but even though the HD does not add to the visual clarity, it does better represent the original look of the film. The Clerks X dvd masked many of the flaws in the 16mm film format with digital compression artifacts, but the bluray shows the film as it really was, ""warts and all"".Oh Yeah! Its a funny movie too!"
1,Overrated --Read a Book Instead!,"After hearing people talk about how great this low budget film was, I was expecting to see a good comedy about what its like to work in one of those mini marts and the oddballs that drop in at all hours. Instead, I was totally bored and had no trouble keeping myself from even a chuckle. The dialog between the characters was not particularly interesting---just mainly vulgar which bores me to death. My wife left the room after a half hour of it as she felt it was too offensive. I think I turned it off after 45 minutes. Recommendation: Buy a good book instead and don't waste your time or money with this DVD."
1,Potty-Mouthed and Boring,"""Clerks"" is a comedy, filmed in black and white showing a day in the life of Clerks working in a convenience store. It is a cult film directed by Kevin Smith. Most of the film looked like it was shot for a high school film project. Potty-mouthed dialogue between Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson) was ninety-percent of the film. Two scenes outside the convenience store (hockey game on the roof and visiting a funeral home) were the only breaks one got.Overall this cult film is just boring."
1,Very Bad Movie,"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. As much as I tried to watch and be open-minded about it. Sorry but this is a bit of a BIG let-down. I gave it 1 star only because a half was not shown. Unless you like that kind of comdey, I just feel I totally lost my money."
4,it was OK,I really hate giving anything a 4 out of 5 but this movie wasn't incredible like mallrats or dogma. This movie has some really funny lines and if you don't listen closly you wont like the movie at all.
5,"""Just because they serve you,dosen't mean they like you.""","Two convenient store clerks come to terms with there love life,there friendship and there future.Discovering in the process that they are not better than any of there customers{which they hate},and that just because you love someone,dosent mean they love you back.CHARLETTE K"
4,Kevin Smith Genius at work,"Kevin Smith is an evil genius. In my Kevin Smith Collection, Clerks comes in at 4th. #1 Mallrats (would you like a chocalate covered peritzel?), #2 Dogma (naked big breasted women don't just fall out of the sky you know). #3 the Clerks animated cartoons, then #4 Clerks and #5 Jay an Silent Bob Strike Back (""smokin' weed, smokin' weed, doing coke drinkin beers..."") If it had the deleted sceens in the movie it would have been #1. And Last at #6 Chasing Amy (""fingercuffs"")reason: less the 5 minutes of Jay and Silent Bob = crime !!!Everyonme should own this DVD and all the DVD's I have mentioned above. It is well worth it."
4,16mm film that doesn't suck. ..,"The film that introduced us to Jay and Silent Bob, brought writer/directer Kevin Smith to the forefront. This movie is brilliantly witty and criminally vulgar. Above all else it is hilarious. Brian O'Halleron's character Dante plays a great loser. Dante and Randall are great at debating the most pointless things. It is also funny to see the placement of this film in the series of Kevin Smith movies as they are all inter-related. Well worth the money, and damn funny, this is a must have for anyone who likes sarcastic comedy or has liked any other Kevin Smith movie."
3,Call Me Crazy!!!,"I love the movie Clerks, but how can you possibly rate this new release of this movie, and all the extras, when it has not even been released, nor is this version available for public viewing? Use this ratings forum for what it is designed for...any post prior to this should have been under the original release of the movie, not an unreleased version. Call me crazy, but that is how I see it. By the way, I am looking forward to the new release...especially now that I have read all the 5-star reviews. Love ya...mean it!"
3,Damn good first effort,"What I'd like to have seen more of in ""Clerks"" was the idiot customers, like the 'Milk Maids' or the guy who wants ice in his coffee. That stuff was right on the money. The Death Star discussion, too -- I actually had that conversation with folks BEFORE SEEIN THE MOVIE!What drags the film down is the love interest part of it. There's like this long conversation in the middle of it that goes NOWHERE for like 10 minutes. Also, what went down in the bathroom kinda ruined the credibility of the movie.However, as a whole I found ""Clerks"" to be an accurate depiction of life working at a convenience store."
3,should have animated series,"its got alot of extra features to a hilarious movie, but for it to be complete, it should include clerks: the animated series"
1,Clerks,"I ordered a DVD in""LIKE NEW"" condition.When I received it,it was loose in it's package therefore it was horribly scratched up."
4,Kevin Smith's First!,"Excellent flick about the daily life of Dante(who wasn't suppost to be there today!) and Randal. Shot in Black and White this Miramax flick was made with a budget of $27,000.Well scripted by Kevin Smith."
4,You'll like it...despite its imperfections,"After having seen ""Mallrats"" and ""Chasing Amy"" first, I finally found and rented ""Clerks"", the first installment of Kevin Smith's New Jersey trilogy. I knew beforehand that it was black-and-white and that Kevin Smith sold his comic book collection to get the film made. Knowing that, I was already impressed. Though not as outright slapstick humor-like as ""Mallrats"", ""Clerks"" is amusing...in that sickening sort of way. It is twenty-something independent film at its best...complete with actors who are not in the least ""quintessential Hollywood"" (and never will be). It took me a second viewing of it to appreciate it as I do now. Don't let its drawbacks detract you from renting or buying this movie. You'll find yourself loving it without even knowing a valid reason why."
2,not worth the money,"I love Mr. Egoscue's work. His techniques are right on! However, this book was very wordy and did not deliver like his other media has. Pain Free and the Pain Free workout are much more meaty and helpful."
2,too wordy,"I highly recommend Egoscue's other book PAIN FREE which worked miracles in my life ....helped me aleviate back pain I have had for years! This book, however is tedious and wordy. I would recommend you stick with his other books ...unless you are pregnant and then this one might be very helpful."
3,NOT AS COMPLETE AS THE ORIGINAL PAIN FREE,"THIS BOOK WAS EXPRESSLY FOR WOMEN'S ISSUES, I AM EXPERIENCING SEVERE NECK PAIN AND FOUND MORE INFO IN THE ORIGINAL PAIN FREE. THIS BOOK WOULD BE FINE IF YOU HAD A FEMALE PAIN ISSUE."
5,You will see yourself in the book,"The book was AWESOME. You will see yourself in each character. I could totally relate to Yolanda. I saw myself in the others as well, but Yolanda hit home for me. It's a good book for self-reflection and group discussion. You will not be able to put the book down. It is a MUST READ."
3,Gift,This was a gift for my wife that didn't stay on her shelf for long. She was moderately engaged reading this book.
1,Only 1 Star for Me BUT..,"that's because I watched my daughter live the first chapter; didn't need read about it. However, the writing IS very good, plot seems to make sense."
2,This thing drips,The product looks nice and is constructed of thick stainles steel. I don't like the rubbery stopper at the end of the spout but it works.The problem is that the thing drips like crazy if you're doing anyting less than a max pour.
3,Not for those with arthritis,"I thought the design was sleek and loved the idea of the spout cover. However, I have arthrtis in my hands and could not remove the spout cover. I also found it awkward to hold with my tender hands.This would probably be perfect for younger cooks with no hand problems, but for me, it didn't work. Shame - because it seemed very well made.I asked for a return and refund and got an instant response, so 5 stars to the seller for customer care."
2,Faulty design,"When you tip to pour sufficient liquid, it overflows over the top. This is a faulty design. If I could, I would return"
5,A wonderful classic,"Reading this book each Christmas has become a tradition for our family and everyone we have given it to. I have been reading this story to my children for 8 years. They are now twelve years old and still enjoy it. The illustrations are wonderful and the story has a great upbeat rhythm. As the tree gets cut smaller and smaller and someone smaller inherits it, we take turns remembering who gets it next. When we need a christmas present for a young child, this book is always our first choice."
5,This book brings out the true meaning of Christmas,"Well, I rememeber this book from when I was a kid. It is fitting that those families who found the top of Mr. Willoby's tree thought of it as a gift, not something that had to be bought. I made sure I had a copy of this book for my daughter to grow up with. I love Mr. Willoby's Christmas Tree"
5,Great Story,I grew up reading this story and wanted to get it for my son. So glad that I found it so easily and it was brand new.
5,A second generation gets to enjoy this book!,I first bought this book many years ago after hearing Captain Kangaroo read this story on his morning TV show. My children all enjoyed it. Now I am buying it so that our grandchildren can have a chance to read this book. It is a charming story!
2,"To quote the Beatles ""It's a dirty story of a dirty man...""","I read this book several years ago, and i don't look back to it as one of the books that i really enjoyed. Sure, if you want to prove a point that people and society are evil, then you could probably use this book. The characters have no redeeming qualities to them, and so when their lives slide into ruin, you can maybe feel sorry for them, but you aren't torn up that such bad things happened to them. Life is a lot better than that."
2,Mellencamp's disappointment,"After his best album ever (Big Daddy), Mellencamp followed it up with this waste of time. Apparently he tried to regain the hard rocking sound he had with earlier efforts (Uh Huh and American Fool), but whereas those albums had great tunes, Whenever We Wanted is just a mangle of hard guitar sounds.The opening track, ""Love and Happiness"" is probably memorable with its political commentary, and ""Get a Leg Up"" got some radio play, but the album as a whole is quite forgettable. This one and Mr. Happy Go Lucky are two Mellencamp albums I wish he hadn't made."
1,Check to make sure they fit your speaker,"the brackets only fit those speakers. under compatible speakers it list almost all of Sony's speakers but what it does not say is that you have to purchase additional arms so it can fit your particular speaker. there are at least 3 types of arms (type A,B,C)it also does not tell you that the arms are 70 dollars and only available via Sony Direct Accessories website(DAPC) oh yea one more thing that's 70.00 for each arm if you have 2 speakers that's 140.00 if you have 6 speakers (like I do)that's 420.00 for arms (that should come with this kit) plus the 90.00 you initially spent."
5,HP Black Inkjet Cartridge,"I ordered the cartridge from Amazon mainly because I could not find it anywhere in my town... rec'vd the cartridge pretty quickly, installed it, works fine."
1,Not for kindle,"No table of contents makes it unusable. I could not find a way to locate the scripture index and even if I could there is no page reference, with the kindle, to locate the associated figure of speech by page. I'm disappointed that I had to return this great work."
2,Okay but fell apart quickly,The gloves look and feel great but the stitching started to come out of the thumb and one of the fingers the came out the second time I wore them.
5,Before Antillia,This movie tells the story of what happens before the game called Zone of Enders for the PS2. Its basically about how the first Orbital Frame called Idolo and its team of creators lives are spent out in the area's of Mars. Also includes a bit of the origin of Viola. The plots interesting with a few twists here and there and the animation is perfect. A definate pickup if your a fan of Z.O.E.
3,Not the Best!,"I always like to go to the nearest supplier of anime, and just pick something out that's a reasonable/low (heh) price. Well I happened to see this, at the store, and knew I've heard it from somewhere but didn't know where! Anyway... it's ok, the story and everything... but really mecha series get kinda old after a while... I mean there's just too many of 'em like Gundam, Gasaraki, Nadesico, Robotech etc. The animation is well... the opposite of what my friends think anime is, in other words the people seem to have small eyes! I've seen better animation but it's still worth watching! It's an ok movie to watch, but if your looking for something really awesome try Nadesico!"
1,Ghastly,"Most of it is NOT about the NDE... and ALL of it is religious fundamentalism. This is pretty much the OPPOSITE of what the vast body of literature about NDEs has to say. AND it has a strong Catholic leaning. My personal friend (a fellow doctor) had an NDE and had specifically asked about her Catholicism. The spirits around her found her query amusing and explained that there IS on one ""true"" religion (the nature of her query), that almost all religions miss the point, and it all is about LOVE.She is now strong in her belief in God, her confidence in a loving and wonderful after life for ALL persons, she is now strongly pro-choice and is strongly in support of gay rights. She had not held those views before being bathed in God's Love.This book is awful. Don't waste your money or your time."
1,"This Movie Really, Really, Really Sucks!!!!!!","I hate this movie so much. Im not gonna go and tell you what it's about, just that the previews are false advertisement. This is not a horror movie, it's not scary, and it sucks. There is some lame ass killings, but at the end it was all a prank, nobody died, except the teacher. Just by reading this, it's like you seen the movie. No need in paying money or buying it when it comes to DVD."
3,"It's okay, but.....","I wouldn't call this movie perfect, but I'd call it okay. It's not really a horror, but it's a mystery. It was good 'til the end. Once I heard about it, I thought it would be a slasher like Scream or Friday the 13th (In Cry_Wolf, 'The Wolf' used the same knife that Mrs. Voorhees and the Scream Stalker used), and, to conclude this review, it wasn't too scary (to me)."
2,Cry Wolf hardly has any bite,"Cry Wolf should probably never have been in the movies. It would've made a good after school special though and that's about it. Julian Morris and Lindy Booth play two students who create a serial killer as a prank. Things go bad when the killer becomes real and no one believes them because they have lied already. Supernatural fans may also want to see it for Jared Padalecki as Morris' room-mate who is also in on the prank. The movie offers a lot of decent plot turns but most of them might annoy you, except the last one which is actually brilliant in a Usual Suspects rip-off sort of way."
1,Woefully Bad,"When a supposed horror film is rated PG-13 - the original rating of this film - you know that its a bad sign from the start. That's only the beginning of the crapness of this blundering, stupid and uninvolving film which also strangely features Jon Bon Jovi in a rare acting role. The film centres around a group of school friends who love to play games with each other realising that someone is no longer playing fair or at all, for that matter. What ensues is a pointless, boring and ultimately unsatisfying ride which ends with what I can only assume was meant to be a twist ending. Don't waste your time on this rubbish."
2,This is high school. Nothing's for real.,"To keep it very simple, this movie is cheesy. It's basically a teen movie, complete with corny teen movie soundtrack, about some high school students who pull a dangerous stunt on campus, attempting to convince their classmates that there is a killer lurking about.It's just barely entertaining enough to hold your attention and keep you mildly amused. The story takes a few turns and ends no better than it begins, in the vein of ""twist ending"" suspense films. Cry wolf is neither scary nor gory - and there is certainly nothing ""Unrated"" about the movie or this DVD edition. No nudity, gore or cursing... I don't quite understand.This movie might be good for some amusement if you have nothing else to watch and need to kill some time. It's not completely terrible, but there's nothing that stands out about it, either."
2,Not quite,"CRY_WOLF is not an absolute stinker, I must say, but on the other hand not near the likes of Scream, Nightmare or Halloween. The greatest problems are pace and acting, as the script is quite good. If only they had given dear Julian Morris some acting lessons, instead of Valium, I would have given it 3/5. Rent it if you have nothing better to watch, but I wouldnt buy."
4,great teen movie,"I really enjoyed this movie, I thought it was a good movie for teens. But I think even adults would enjoy this movie. I really liked the twists in the movie. The movie went in an interesting way that was a little unexpected, however it was a little bit expected as well. But I did enjoy the story line, however I did feel that the character's were very much predictable teens that seemed almost cookie cutter. We have seen these types of characters before in other teen slasher movies. However, the movie with it's ""slasher"" dynamic's was believeable. The fact that a teen girl can get that invovled to push her to do outragious things is very believable. All in all, it's a fun movie. I remember playing the wolf game (they played in the church) at camp. I did feel that the movie depicted the game as being this taboo game that the teens in the movie may have taken too seriously. When actually playing the game in real life is just fun and a good way of getting to know each other."
1,a waste of five dollars,"This movie is so stupid, dont see it, unless you want to waste your time and money. playing with grass is more fun. the only thing good was when the kid shot Jon Bon Jovi."
3,An interesting ride,"I give Cry Wolf 3 1/2 stars. You could certainly do worse than this little flick, which will keep you entertained, despite the PG-13 rating. Cry Wolf focuses on a group of high school students at a prep school. They play a game that involves lies and trying to get others to take the bait of those lies. But the group wants to take the game to the next level and use the whole school as a playing ground for this game. A local woman is found murdered in the woods, and the group decides this is the perfect basis for their lies. They send out an email warning of ""The Wolf"" who is supposedly responsible for this heinous murder and isn't going to stop with one. But soon it's hard to tell what's truth and what's lies. And that's what makes Cry Wolf plenty of fun. It's interesting enough, although I must admit I've seen better. I could think of much worse ways to waste my time, so if you like things that aren't quite what they seem, you'll indeed appreciate Cry Wolf. Enjoy!"
4,Great first attempt by someone new to the movie scene,"While I was one of the two oldest people in the theater (my friend being the other), I actually really enjoyed this movie BECAUSE it is a scary movie that I would be okay taking my twelve-year-old brother to see. If this was meant to cater to twenty-somethings, I might have been disappointed, but it's supposed to be for teenagers so I pretty much knew what to expect upon entering (not quite sure why others seem surprised). The camera work was fantastic, acting was pretty good (especially the kid that played Owen) if perhaps a little over-done at times, and the story line had a few twists. I will take my little brother to see this and be comfortable, and he will love it (as did the other teens in the theater). Not bad for a first-timer."
2,Does God is going to send me to Hell?,"As a humble Mozambican I don't to say anything contrary to that magnificent man Mr.Warren,although I must say that I consider unfair that God send whoever eternally to Helll.If a simple man don't muster enough courage to condemn his son to Hell,how to think that the so called mercy God can do so?However,I am an ignorant and poor Mozambican..."
2,Only a pamphlet,I thought I was buying a book. My mistake. This is a tiny pamphlet and it doesn't say much at all.
5,the purpose driven life,A fantastic life changing read. I hope everyone takes the time to read and enjoy this book. God bless us all
1,Only an abbreviated version,I was disappointed this was not the whole book. This is like a 60 page summary not the whole book. That was not stated. I would not have purchased had I known this.The book itself is excellent and I would highly recommend it. I got it from the library.
5,Very Helpful in My Journey Through Life,I am a believer and this book clarified some issues for me.This is a good read for all Christians.
3,Not the best,"I would have loved more information, but this book did not cut it for me whatsoever. I have deleted this from my kindle, and wont be dowloading this again"
2,Brown Essential Work Armor Gloves,"The puncture resistant material on the palms of the gloves is fabulous! However, the thin material over the backs was shredded withing a couple of days. Wouldn't bother wasting my money!"
2,Good explanations but too many errors in the solutions,"I bought this book because I liked the way it was organized and the material it covered. The explanations are good. However, when I started to work the exercises, I found that many of the answers in the back of the book are wrong. To prove it, I input the values into Excel and had it compute them. My answers matched those from Excel, so I must conclude that the answers in the back are wrong.I suggest buying the Schaum's Outline book on Statistics by Spiegel."
5,Good Resource,"Okay, so this isn't pleasure reading...And I only bought it because it was assigned.Still, I'm working in the securities area this summer and I don't know what I'd do without it. Hornbooks are great and I highly recommend them. But sometimes they don't really delve into the fine points of the law. This book is all about the fine points. I'll admit it's dense, but securities law isn't the simplest of topics. The other textbooks I've seen don't have as many cases and they seem to gloss over important topics like materiality which isn't that terrible until you need to know whether a particular activity is material.Does the book cover a lot of ground? Yes. Is it a challenging read? Yes. Is there a better Sec. Reg. text out there? I haven't seen one."
1,very unclear,"This is a very unclear book with horrible, dense prose. The authors seem to have an impressive grasp of securities law, and fill the notes with many meaningful substantive explications of various technical points, but they are basically just awful writers, which makes this text a serious chore to read. Of course, no one is going to buy it unless it is assigned in a law school class, so its lack of clarity unfortunately won't really induce ""customers"" to buy a different securities text, but it is worth noting that you will probably need to go ahead and buy a very good hornbook right from the start. In your class, I'd suggest you read this text as little as possible: it will make your head hurt, and it's far too dense to teach you securities regulation effectively."
1,Poorly Written,"Clumsy, obtuse, talentless writing, riddled with passive voice and tortured syntax. Securities Reg is hard enough as it is without a lousy casebook. Advice to other students: skip the readings if you can get away with it, and rely instead on Gilbert or E&E. Advice to professors: get some other casebook--any other casebook--because this one is a dog."
3,DISAPPOINTING,"I have terribly dry skin on my thighs and the back of my arms. I was hopeful this lotion would help, but it didn't seem to. I gave it a lengthy trial. My search for the right lotion continues."
1,BHT and EDTA!!!!!!!!!,This product doesn't sell well and/or isn't popular because it contains BHT and EDTA. Please stop using this! Some people will put anything in/on their bodies...
4,It works.,My girlfriend says she only has to apply this moisturizer about a third as often as her old moisturizer. And she loves that it doesn't smell.
5,look into the future,"I found this movie to be one of the many animes about cyborgs, this one has a twist, the cyborg is having trouble controlling his aggression when taking on the bad guys. The thought that he is becoming as violent as the enemy he must stop causing him to doubt his affectiveness as a hero."
2,Buy the 1999 edition or another collection of reviews.,The 1999 edition is better because it contains lists at the back of titles by selected directors. Maltin is trying to sell his movie encyclopedia; so he leaves out these lists in the 2000 edition. Maybe you should pay a little more and buy the Video Hound guide.
2,Seambuster,My husband was a little disappointed because he found the same exact tool for half the price at Harbor Freight! But he kept it anyway.
3,Great watcch Terrible Strap,"Received this watch with Amazon's usual speedy delivery and service. As soon as I opened it and tried to put it on I knew there was a problem. Getting the clasp on the strap is a challenge and once closed, the strap is very uncomfortable. It feels bulky and clunky. Why couldn't they just have put a simple leather strap on it? The watch is beautiful but I didn't think I should have to go and buy a new strap for a brand new watch. Unfortunately, I returned it the same day I received it. It was a beautiful watch and I'm sure I would have enjoyed wearing it."
2,A clunker of a book...,"In her Pulitzer Prize winning ""No Ordinary Time"", Doris Kerns Goodwin quoted some interesting excerpts from Winston Estes' novel. I was intrigued to find out more and tracked down ""Home Front"". Unfortunately, the Goodwin's well-chosen excerpts were the only good things from Estes' novel which was a big disappointment.*** Estes' focuses on the small town community of Bentley near Atlanta, Georgia where things move slowly and not a whole lot happens except for church gatherings and whenever trains pull into town. When WW2 comes along, you can hardly tell the difference except for the heavy-handed sermons on the merits of the war. The writing style is simplistic and very reminiscent of Reader's Digest stories, and the characters are wooden and aloof. Even the war can't provide Estes with a real plot. Spare yourself the agony of searching for this book, much less actually reading it."
5,It is so different from the series!!!!! I LOVE IT!!!!!!!,"This book is totally the bomb!! It is so different from the series but in a way it's better!!! I absolutely love act 4: Masquerade!! I love that love scene!!!! And since Sailor Jupiter is my Favorite character!! I loved seeing her blast away Nephrite!! Well I don't want to spoil anymore so I guess I'll leave you who hadn't read it yet, to find out for yourself what happens next!!! > ^ _ ^ <"
5,The Begining,"Sailor Moon 1 - where do I begin? This book is wonderful! Definetally a must own for any and all Sailor Moonies out there. Sailor Moon and her fellow scouts awaken and they begin battling the evil Queen. It ends with them finally getting Sailor Jupiter. The drawings are breath taking, and the words were well translated, as well as they could have been (Good Job). I love it, as I'm sure you will to! Buy it!"
4,"Well, it's been quite a wait...","So many Sailor Moon fans have been waiting for years to see it printed in English! While I'm no big fan of Mixxine, I have to say that this is a must have for any English-speaking SM fan. If you've only seen the DiC'd version, you have got to experience the real thing!"
4,Very easy to install and works as promised,"I just installed this thing and I am pretty happy with the results. It's hard to see how installation could be any simpler - simply screw the two provided screws into the wall. I did it with a plain old screwdriver although it'll be easier if you have a power drill of course.It's very easy to get a bike on and off. I'm a bit nervous about how stably mounted it is, there's a bit of give if I pull down on the bike, but I think that has more to do with the stud placement and strength of my walls versus the design of the product itself.There's really not much else to it. I'm only docking one point since it is $15 which seems a bit high considering that there's really nothing in this package other than exactly what you see, and I feel like to deserve a 5-star rating it would have had to be less than 10 bucks..."
2,"Screws break, so get your own.","So I've pre-drilled the holes and I'm drilling past 1/2inch drywall into a stud. The first screw head twists off. The second screw twists appart in the wall, leaving me with half a screw. The third screw gets 90% of the way and the head pops off.Made in China strikes again. The screws provided are near worthless. I have provided my own, quality screws and mounting went up alright.I gave this product 2 stars because I'm getting tired of buying junk from China, made to inferior specs. I would have chalked one breaking up to myself, but 3 out of 4 is a manufacturers defect, you simply don't have those issues with a Made in the USA screw. Home Depot saved the day. FYI, I'm not some first time installer either, I do all my own work in the house and on the cars. Screws breaking while installing is classic bad product. We wouldn't expect this anywhere else, why are we putting up with junk from China?"
3,"Decent, but not rugged","I bought 12 of these for a hanging bike rack in a co-op house. Within 6 months, 3 of them broke. The welds that attach the bar to the base snapped off. 2 of them are still usable, as only 1 joint broke.I don't know how rough the person was on the hook to make it snap, and 9 of them are still working. So I would say if you are gentle with them, they should work fine. Maybe not so good for an industrial, student co-op, or teenagers who are liable to drop the bike onto the hook."
1,COMPLETE TALENTLESS NUMETAL GARBAGE!!!!,"This album not is comparable to Slipknot but its pretty much the same exact band. Only non musicians and kids can possible think these guys have talent. There absolutley no structure in the song writing. The lyrics might b ""deep"" but theyre just random words with no ryme or reason. Typical new metal garbage is right they re all the same. Its a disgrace that this style is even called metal its not its pop with screamed lyrics , metal is about emotion and musicianship which this has neither of. And to even dare say that the bass player is liek les claypool is pure filth, there less than zero similarities."
1,boo hoo i need a tissue,i also need a bucket to puke in because this album is terrible like their new album it's a load of......um i better not say because it would offended all the mudvayne fans and send them into a rage i was definalty in a rage after hearing this album i couldn't believe how horrible and dis-jointed the band play together the worst excuse for a band..this sux this sux this suxboo hoo i've used the bucket after a minute of this album
5,Defining Album,"They can't live up to this and thank God, for that. This album is a hallmark of an age. An age of metal, that will come in about 5 to 10 years. People will look back on this album and realize that this was the first of a new generation, and that it has been vastly under apprectiated. First of all, the Bass... Ryan Martinie is flawless... The bass actually serves a purpose in the songs... not just a walking backdrop. It acts as a second guitar, the way its supposed to be. Chad Gray, has written obviously superb lyrics, and he underscores his singing with some dramatic off center screaming. Every thing on this album serves a purpose. It is efficient and direct. If you listen closely enough you'll start to hear things that you never heard before either. Especially in the bass section. Don't let people fool you. Listen for yourself and decide. This is truly a masterpiece before its time."
2,Not all that,"..there are a few catchy songs on the album, DIG and -1 a lot of the songs have no structure, its just non stop screaming, Kud does have an excellent singing voice, but on their next album they should work on making the songs a little more catchy ala Dig ,"
4,Their loud and obnoxious and parents think they (...)-they're,"MuDvAyNe!! Except Mudvayne should be called KUDvayne. Because Kud is one of the best singers out there. He can roar, scream, or SING. The rest of the band is awesome too. Mudvayne's costumes are great too, especially in the video for Dig.The best songs are Dig, Prod, and Severed. Dig is a great single except for the fact that in every line they say 'F**k' or 'motherf**k'. Severed is 6 minutes long and it's a great blend of singing, screaming and growling. Prod frequently stops after a line or two for about 1-2 seconds and then goes back to the loud vocals and instruments.MuDvAyNe is not the most talented band, nor the most easy to listen to, nor the best, but they rock. Period. Buy this album f you are looking for something like Slipknot except heavier and slower. Also if you want something with nice blends of amany things get this."
3,Descent CD,"First of all, let me give them credit. They look awesome, and sound awesome. They are one of the most unique looking and sounding bands. In other words, what they do, they do well. Dig is also an awesome music video and song. Now the bad stuff. All the songs (except ""Dig"") sound almost identical! The lyrics, guitar riffs, and drum beats do vary, but not enough to make it better. It was hard to tell the difference between some songs when I first bought the CD. As for the whole thing about the Mudvayne-Slipknot comparison, they only sound a little similar. Their lyrics are completely different! I do like both bands by the way. If you want ""quieter"" (compared to Slipknot) and more ""thought provoking"" music go with this. But if your expecting chaotic tunes throughout the CD like ""Dig"", consider not buying this (instead go with their big brother Slipknot). Both bands are good though!"
5,A Perfect Cd!!,"First of all this is one of the greatest bands of all times.The lyrics really stand out!...Not a single song on this cd is bad.The best songs on this aulbum are DeathBlooms,Dig,Served,-1,Cradle,Pharmaecopia.Heck they all good!!If you Like CoalChamber,Slipknot,korn,and all them kick A&& bands then you will like this to.Buy This CD!!!...Buy It!!"
3,Wow!!!,"Don't get me wrong with the 3 stars. I really do like this album! It has a great, new sound and all the members are talented. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because I only like about half the tracks. The half I do like are all unique and don't sound at all similar. The last half just doesn't do it for me. The songs kinda blur together and I end up pressing stop. But I LOVE Dig, Internal Primates Forever, -1, Death Blooms, and Nothing to Gein is simply one of the best songs ever. This band gets real melodic at times and then just whiplash! I may just need to listen to it some more before I begin to appreciate the entire disc. I'd really like to give it 3.5 stars, because I like it better than 3. The only album I would even consider giving 5 stars would be Snot's Get Some."
4,"WOW, great album","Mudvayne really hit a plateau with this album that I don't believe they ever had before or will in the future (judging by recent releases - Lost & Found, HELLYEAH?). Amazing musicianship for a metal band here. Reminds me of a mix of Tool and Pantera, but they definitely have their own flavor as well."
5,Second to only Slipknot!!!!!!,"a very long and great cd!!!!!! hardcore slipknot-like music!!! i really enjoy the begining of the cd. he sings a little too much on the second half instead of screaming but i can let that go. if you like slipknot, or soulfly, youll like this cd tracks 2,3,4 will blow you away. a worthwhile investment!!"
5,Metal Masterpeice,"Mudvayne IS NOT a Slipknot clone at all. They are one of the most intelligent original and thought provoking bands out there. Buy this cd. ""Dig"" is the WORST song on there. So don't judge them by that song."
2,not great,"To tell you the truth, I was very dissapointed with this CD. I heard the single ""Dig"" on the radio, thinking that the band produced many songs like this. After buying the CD, I realized how 'not good' it was. One thing you'll notice is that there are many of what I have come to call ""B.S. Songs"" on this cd, which are tracks that are nothing more than sounds created by a synthesizer, and a waste of time and space. Even Slipknot is better than this band. The only thing good about MuDvAyNe is the interesting war paint designs, and bassist RyKnow has some neat bass lines and techniques here and there."
4,Falling Between The Cracks,"Releasing ""Dig"" as a first single was a big mistake for Mudvayne. It became a hit with the mindless nu-metal ...fratboys and the rest of their album is forgotten because it sounds nothing like ""dig"". Mudvayne defines progressive heavy metal, not Tool progressive rock, but metal...that means it's heavier and the singer isn't always singing(which he should be, Kud's voice is great)...progressive music is difficult for most people to get into these days because ""rock"" fans just want something to mosh to. Actually thinking about the music structure and experiencing the songs are apparently too much work for your average 12 year old in a Slipknot t-shirt. Hopefully somebody someday in the near future will realize that these guys have some talent and killer potential that lies outside of ""Dig"" territory...pick this up if you really enjoying listening to music and not just throwing yourself into someone else."
5,Just another fan of MuDvAyNe,"This CD is one of my favorites of all time. It's got some of the most kick-ass lyrics that you will ever hear(Especially in Dig, Severed, and Death Blooms) The only problem I have is that they didn't make a music video for the song ""Severed"". That song is my favorite off of the record."
5,Before MuDvAyNe Went South,"This album rules. I saw the video for ""Dig"" back in 2001 and got hooked. That is until ""Lost And Found"" came out. I honestly wanted to cry. I really tryed to like that piece of crap, but I just couldn't do it. Use your money to buy this instead. Listen to ""Nothing To Gein"". It shows true musical talent."
1,Horrible,"This is the worst band ever. Im sure people will get this because of ""dig"", but dont. Save your money.This is so bad. Im sure people say it's like SlipKnot. Its not, its a gothic version of koRn.My advice, Save your money"
3,this is not the tape measure you will receive,"I have used this tape measure for years, I had to buy them online when they stopped selling them in all the Lowes/ Home Depot. Unfortunatly this is not the tape measure you will get. The one you get is the stanley max air lock. Basically a cheaper version."
4,Tragic love story,"As part of the British band the Kydds, Seth Grealy and Peyton Masters conquered the world in the mid-60s and 1970s. When they came out as lovers, after witnessing the Stonewall riots on TV, Peyton and Seth find themselves both embraced and rejected by those around them and the world, and their lives are changed irrevocably. And years later when Seth is killed, Peyton has to come to terms with his own life and with his lover's killer. ""Plastic Jesus"" is a glorious homage to the Beatles and Beatlemania, as well as a tragic love story in the vein of Emma Donoghue's ""Hood"". This illustrated novella, while missing Brite's usual gothic textures, nonetheless radiates her storytelling prowess."
5,Great,"That is the only word that will fit. Dres is my favorite HIP HOP artist. Not that Rap bull. He does everything right on this album, with the exception of THe choice is your, in which he says he doesnt like he just did it to get radio play. Listen to the album. In the skit before it he is making fun of ignorant listener who want him to make a song on their level which he prominently states ""Get out of here"". Then at gun point (metaphorically) he is forced to put this garbage out. Dres Is the purist lyricist I've heard and i'm 29 not 19. If you don't like Radio Rap, you Must have this and every Dres album made. Yes De La and Tribe are great as a group but put Dres up against any of them and it's over."
1,"Hey, Andrew ""Radaar""","When you say something that gives away the entire ending of a twenty four hour series, why don't you put up a notice so someone doesn't just stumble upon it. Here's an example:THERE ARE SPOILERS AHEAD!1.2.3.4.5.then put whatever you want. Please don't spoil endings for someone. Assume they haven't seen it."
5,24 season three action,Excellent program filled with action and excitement. We can't wait to get into season 4. The program was very well done.
1,Two of the disc did not play.,The show is good but some of the disc would'nt play. There was also a glitch on the first two disc.
3,"not as good as season 1 or 2, but still entertaining","Season three starts off slow in the first half. It's still entertaining, but not the must-watch-every-episode-now drama that is in every episode of the first two seasons. However, in the second half, it really picks up, and the last few episodes are great. The final episode may be even better than season 1's finale.Definitely a must have and must own, as with all the 24 season DVD's."
5,Gotta love Jack,I am a huge fan of 24 and I normally ending up liking the season better when I watch it the second time. A well worth buy. Jack is one crazy man and you can't get in his way.
1,DO NOT ORDER THIS FROM DUDJUNG,Beware...do not order this CD from the reseller Dudjung...he is totally irresponsible..shipped me a defective CD and won't even bother to answer my many emails about it....have asked Amazon to delist him...

Amazon will not cover this either, they only help with items which are materially different than what you ordered.Buyer, beware."
2,disappointing,"I picked this book up thinking it would be a fan's eye view of the New York punk scene in the 70's. Although there is some of that in there, the vast majority of the book is an autobiography of the writer. This is where other's may disagree, but if you find tales of relatives, and drug use fascinating, then you will love it. If not, then you won't."
5,Excellent book for learning about the body,"This book is an excellent resource for music teachers who recognize the need for sharing accurate information about the body with their students. It is intended as a workbook. The pages follow a certain presentational order but each can be taken alone as a ""project"" to be worked on during a lesson or a practice session, depending on the student's (and teacher's!) needs. I have succesfully used the book as a text in my college-level classes, and with musicians one-on-one, ranging from the professional musician to the 5-year-old beginning piano student. That is the beauty of the book: it's text and illustrations readily convey important information to any musician.Although the book is directed towards musicians, the information would be useful to any performing artist or person seeking information about anatomy and its practical application to movement."
3,Analysis of military's dilemma holds up well post-9/11,"Interesting 1998 book discussing the U.S. military's inability to deal with post-Cold War realities. Greider argues that, determined to maintain all its Cold War capabilities as well as the capacity and profitability of the defense industry, the military failed to adjust staffing, procurement, and strategic planning to the `new world order.' Most of his conclusions hold up well post-9/11: an emphasis on high-tech weaponry at the expense of appropriate staffing levels has led to near-disaster in occupied Iraq, and the vast ramping-up in the defense budget hasn't helped retrieve the situation--though, ironically, it has helped shore up defense industry profits and avoid the downsizing of that sector that Greider predicted. As for the peace dividend, it is long gone."
5,Finally!,A greatest hits collection that actually has all the songs you'd want on it. TFF were a great and original band.
2,Only barely finished this one,"This book is completely ridiculous. I really like the ideas of what happened to Atlantis, but beyond that, the book had its head in the clouds. The author spent pages and pages of each chapter describing technical mumbo-jumbo that was impossible to understand and didn't contribute to the novel. But probably my biggest problem was that the main characters lived to the end! They should have been dead half-way through the book, but apparently disarming a warhead, sinking to the bottom of the ocean, being shot, running out of oxygen, being fired at with missiles, jumping out of flaming helicopters, being attacked by a tiny submarine, and escaping a terrorist prison are all just in a day's work for these people."
2,Not fun at all.,"After reading the review of A. Scott from London, I felt that I just had to throw in my 2 cents worth. I absolutely agree with Mr Scott. More irritating for me than a history lesson being recited, was the one dimensional charaters. I just didn't find any character believable, and really couldn't give a crap whether they lived or died. I knew very little of Atlantis before reading this, but apart from the one or two facts I learned, I have to say, I have wasted a week's reading time."
1,won't even finish it,"I very rarely will not finish a book, but this book just is boring. I love history, culture, archaeology, etc. I expected that I would enjoy this book. The book is just filled with facts that really don't seem important. It it taking forever to get through the book. Maybe the plot is good, but it is so full of other information that most times I forget what the plot is. I have tried on 2 different occassions to finish this book, but I am giving up."
1,Don't go for it!,"Bad character's development. Too many technological devices descriptions. Poor dialogues with comic dramatic situations.Don't go for it, you'll be bored to the bone.The location and how the characters got to it is ridiculous, everyone knows everything, you could discover atlantis while driving your car.Reject it, go for When the Sky Fell, In the Search of Atlantis, Flem-Ath book."
4,Contains some of her best songs...,"This is something of a transitional album for Melissa Etheridge. After he stellar debut and a follow-up that was a bit too raw for the mainstream, there is something of an effort here to go 'pop'. Such songs as 'Ain't It Heavy' and '2001' add some pop beats that are ok, but pretty much disposable. 'Must Be Crazy for Me' and 'Meet Me in the Back' are also upbeat songs but these work.However, digging into the album a bit more we find her strengths, when that acoustic guitar get strumming and her voice really penetrates to the very soul. One of my favorite songs, 'Keep It Precious', is found on this album. The other slower numbers on this album are also excellent showing her range. She is no flash in the pan. Overall, it's not as strong as her debut nor as consistent as 'Yes I Am' but this one's a must have for any fan."
3,"Same Lawall, different day.","Don't get me wrong. It's great to have a text of Petronius for study, especially at a level where young, impressionable students may read it. But look out: all of the really juicy bits were excised under Uncle Gilbert's sharp eye. The raciest anything gets is some innuendo in the Matrona Ephesi. All the good parts are gone, but so are the boring bits of the Cena Trimalchionis and a lot of incidental linking material. You get a nice, tame, classroom-ready version of a trashy Roman novel. Gil Lawall's edition is as mistake-ridden as all of his best work (Ecce Romani, &c.), but the fun of Petronius shines through. Suitable at third-year level and above, with facing notes and generous but not comprehensive glossary."
4,Extech Analog Sound Meter,A good device for the price and for a person who has only occasional use for a sound meter. Easy to use. Easy to read. I bought it because I was going to spend between $600 and $1500 for a new dust collector and wanted to understand the relative noise levels to expect.
3,"Be careful, the paperback version is a study guide","I had to quickly cancel the order. I saw the hardback at >$150 and the paperback at around $40, figured let's go for the paperback. What's not clear is that the ""paperback version"" is the study guide, not the book itself. Too misleading."
5,Who is Jill Scott?,Jill's first album and it came as a breath of fresh air. Not only has Jill Scott one of the most soulful voices i've heard in years but she has integrity and spirit. Her studio work is excellent and Jill Scott live is magical and well worth a try if you like this. There are so many stand out tracks on this CD it is hard to pick out one for special mention. All I can say is buy this album and enjoy the poetry of her lyrics and feel the soul in her vocals. Amazing artist!Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
4,Another great Piece,"I bought this item used and was very pleased with the condition. If you already own Jill's other CD titled ""Experience 826"" then you may be a little disappointed since many of the tracks are repeats. I would still recommend this CD. There are original tracks that you will love. Besides, Jill is a great artist and even though some of the tracks are remakes, it is still great."
2,I should like this album more than I do...,I should like this album more than I do because of it's originality. It's a mixture of street poetry and hip-hop and she has a fine voice but it just doesn't do it for me. I'll stick with Patti Smith or Lauren Hill.
5,Music to my ears,"Jill Scott's cd is one of the best out in a long time. I bought the cd because of word of mouth and not even hearing any songs of hers on the radio. I usually have a ""3 song rule"" in order to even buy the cd, but I took a chance on this one without even 1 song. Her spoken word is as good as her other songs especially ""Exclusively"", but I don't feel like she really got to show her vocal range on the cd. You get a TASTE of her range on the excerpt from ""The Roots"" song on the cd, but I know this woman can blow. I guess now I'll just have to hunt for her concert dates. I know she has to be good live!!"
2,overrated,"After hearing all the hype, I was so excited about my Jill Scott album, only to be let down by a CD that is nothing special... Jill has a great voice, but I just couldn't get myself to care about this album. It reminded me of a cross between M'shell Ndegeocello and Janet Jackson's ""Janet"" album, but not as good as either. It's very earthy, but not profound. If you want some nice background music that doesn't require much concentration, then this is for you. If you're like me and only want to spend your cash on albums you LOVE, maybe you should think twice before ordering this one."
1,Ruth Brown she ain't,"... To be clear again, my only point is that I did not like her music, not that it wasn't any good. It just isn't my style. I assumed it would be more traditional jazz/blues, which it is not. It didn't meet my expectations, even if they were unrealistic."
1,garbage,"This is not soulful, spiritual or any of the other adjectives I have heard hurled around this album. Miss Scott is simply heralded because she is the visual antithesis of the current tired r&b , however her music is really just an inadequate parody of the classic soul that filled the 70s. Dont waste your time or money on this disc unless you just want to be ""hip"" or r&b PC. Pull out your Natalie Cole, Chaka, anything other than this garbage."
5,Who Is Jill Scott?Words &Sounds Vol. !,"DO NOT SLEEP ON THIS CD........this cd should be the cd of the year......Jill Scott has taken music to a whole new level.....all you need is wine, grapes, candles and that special someone to listen to this cd.....IT IS A MUST BUY"
4,"If you didn't know who is Jill Scott, you know now!","In this day of booty-shaking, hood-rat wanting, bass-beat grooving music, it is so refreshing to have Ms. Jill Scott on the scene. Today's music is all about a funky track with horrible lyrics--if you want to call them that. This album contains lyrics that I can actually understand, relate to, and groove to. Her sound is so mellow and poetic. I am now hooked to Jill Scott and I definitely want her to stay on the scene! If you are a true music fan and simply fed up with the so-called music of today, you will be refreshed by Jill Scott's LYRICS AND MUSIC."
3,Grooving,"Jill Scott has the voice of a diva, the looks of a diva, and the presence of a diva, yet I can only give this Cd three stars. Why? Mainly because all the vocals and arrangements seemed to be to similar. There was not much variations to the music. It is worht owning especially for quiet dinner parties."
5,It Will Stay In Your Car,"I have hundreds of CD's and I listen to many different artists but there are four artists that never leave my car. Jill Scott, Rahsaan Patterson, Marvin Gaye and Jazzyfatnastees you can't go wrong with these."
5,Where has this woman been?,I have only had Jill Scott's CD in my hands for about 24 hours but I have been listening to it for almost 20 of those 24 hours. I love her voice! This is a great CD and will definatly NOT be leaving my CD player anytime soon. I especially am lovin the poetry. The women has some serious talent. Makes me wonder what took so long for her to hit the scene?
5,Jill Scott steps out of the shadows,"Every year there is an artist who steps into the limelight (i.e. Badu, Hill, Gray, etc.) and this year that artist is Jill Scott. This is the excellent type of album that will become huge, when the rest of the world catches on at Grammy time. Jill is one of the new wave of artist that have brought the soul and vocal talent back to music and the scary thing is she has even more talent than has been displayed here. Thank You Jill."
5,Philly's best kept secret,"Wow! Why did it take this soulful songstress, so long to step out of the shadows and blow us away with her first full length CD. Jill Scott, who many foolishly compare to Erykah Badu(note to all they are both wonderful singers, with very different styles)puts together a masterpiece on wax. This CD is like a cup of good, hot gumbo, there is a lot of different things in it, but it's all good. We hear Jill flip it from spoken word, to urban soul, and then she even mixes it up with a little hip hop. Stand out tracks include the beautiful ""Love Rain"", ""Gettin In The Way"", and ""Watching Me"", which should feature Goodie Mob if she decides to remix it. All in all this is $12.99 well spent. This CD is actually a ""two-for""- since you will need two copies, one for the car and the other for the crib.Peace, Digge"
5,Realistically speaking,"This is a wakeup call for the ladies of the world. Not only did Ms. Scott mesmerize us with the sultry sounds of an experienced jazz singer, she also expressed a need for woman everywhere to look within themselves, and wake up to whats really going on with relationships, society, personal enrichment etc....a true ""girl"" CD."
1,what??,"Even I can write better songs than Jill Scott. I give her 1 star for the ""effort"" that she put in to this album."
5,The Miradors,"The Miradors is a gripping rendition of a man's struggle to overcome severe clinical depression. Mr. Sherman, having been a psychiatric nurse, was well versed in the treatment of the problem, but finding himself the patient was both frightening and annoying to him. How he copes with the situation, and overcomes it, is as spellbinding as any mystery story. Truly a wonderful, thought provoking, non-fiction work. Mr. Sherman, thank you for sharing this experience with us so we, too, can learn and possibly benefit from your strength and courage."
5,Spyder Marker Maintenance,"Very down to earth, if you're just getting into the sport, or want to know how to break down & fix your marker. this is a very simple guide. glad i bought it, keeps me from having to go to the pro shop with silly problems that I could already fix"
4,My favorite Sibelius recording,"I own seven recordings of the Sibelius violin concerto--it's my favorite violin concerto--but this one takes the cake. Joshua Bell's playing is superb, better even than some of his other recordings. His tone is beautiful, his expression flows magnificently. Nothing is underdone, he plays this concerto to the hilt. When I saw Bell in concert I was annoyed with inconsistencies in his playing, but there are none in this concerto. I have to admit, sometimes I don't listen to the Goldmark concerto on this CD, but it's still wonderful. Still, I think this CD is best bought for the Sibelius. If you're looking for a great recording of that monumental concerto, then look no further--buy this one!"
5,A True and talented man and very missed!,"I have been a fan of Andy Gibb when I was a teen. Now in my 30's I still listen to him and is brothers. He would be 40 this year and he is now gone for 10 years. He is surely one of the talented teen idols for our time and dearly missed. He has a song Arrow through the heart, not release due to his death. I sure would someday like to hear it if his brothers, The Bee Gees would release it in his honor! I will love you forever!"
4,"A Great ""Weird Al"" Yankovic Idea","Here's a great ""Weird Al"" [From The Weird Al Show and Tim And Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]Idea!In since ""Weird Al"" has already done two Michael Jackson parodies, [Eat It [Beat It] and Fat] [Bad] He should do another one being of Michael Jackson's unexpected death called Remember The Dime [Parody of Michael Jackson's Remember The Time] about a guy and a girl breaking up all from the flip of a dime.I'm not bragging but it kinda DOES sound like ""Weird Al"" Yankovic's type of funny music.Anyway...BUY THIS ALBUM OR ELSE ""WEIRD AL"" WILL SIT ON YOU!!! And he's FAT!P.S. I think Remember The Dime would be a song on ""Weird Al"" Yankovic:Greatest Hits,Volume 3. [If Made]"
4,What a band!,This is older music that still rocks into 2007. I bought this for my husband as a birthday present and got a very pleased husband for my trouble. Check out Gov't Mule if you like Allman Brothers.
3,Def. A great Classic Rock Gem!,"Orginally,wasn't too familiar with the allman brothers band. I'd heard of them,but was not really in the mood to download them since I have ton of old music that i listen to. I decided to get their best hits album, and I thought most of it was pretty good. I really enjoy their rough garage rock sound, and though the lead singer's vocals were pretty standard for a rock singer. I was afraid that this album would be a bit too much on the country side, but I was glad that they didn't stray away from the rock sound. Overall, my favorite songs that I really like were southbound ramblin man, and whipping post. I really liked the folksy blueness of this band. They seem to remind me alot of the Doobie Brothers which were propably competing against them in the charts during this time frame."
1,This charger feels like a vending machine toy.,"The Delkin battery seems average, but upon opening and plugging in I felt the charger...roughly the weight of a piece of printer paper. Very poorly made, to say the least. Still looking for an alternitive brand."
5,Great Price!!!!,Great Price!!! I shop around my neighborhood and just a waste of gas money.I looked into this place in the internet and saw the price and just could not believe it. Price is low compare to any electronic store. Will shop in this place in the future if I need anymore batteries.
3,Not a bad debut. Their one good moment.,"""The Tower"", ""Rock & Rollers"", and ""On & On"" are great songs that make this one worth a listen. ""The Tower"" is reminiscent of Rush's fantasy/sci-fi concept period, while ""On & On"" and ""Rock & Rollers"" recall Angel's other obvious influence, Kiss. Angel wasn't a great band but they did have their moments. All of those moments can be found here, on their debut album, on which they turned in a session of not-bad hard rock before churning out teeny-bubblegum pop for the remainder of their albums."
3,Really bad sound + not bad music = average disc,Really bad sound + not bad music = average discI think their 2. LP is better (catchier)! Remastering I guess would help here a lot.
3,"Writing, Wrestling, Bears, and Vienna","The above being the 4 things Irving is most known for in his books. Thank God there are no bears in this one. What is present are 2 couples who mutually agree to swap lovers to spice up their lives. Only something happens that hurts this little arrangement: husband and wife from marriage #1 fall in love with the wife and husband from marriage #2. Only, the feelings aren't reciprocated. Jealousy, competitiveness, contempt, and bitterness follow. The couples' children are totally ignored except when one of them is almost killed by a faulty shower door.In situations like this, the story can never have a happy ending.Sidenote: The ""158 Pound"" title refers to the different weight classes in wrestling. 158 lbs is the heaviest."
3,An interesting novel of personal interaction,"Being brand new to John Irving, I decided to grab the smallest novel he wrote to see what his writing style was like. This novel provides the story of two couples and their wife swapping, intermingled with their past histories.I found the history and back story somewhat interesting, but not mundane minglings in the midst of war atrocities, art dealings, college wrestling tournaments, and in their suburban family life.However, the mundane nature of their lives, even though appropriate in terms of sticking with the plot, doesn't tend to a page turner. The terse language and lack of fluidity also makes this book a somewhat chore to read.While it an interesting look at love and personal relationships, the lack of anything compelling with below average fluidity means that I can't really recommend this book."
5,zoomania,The first of 3 novels in this john irving series was SETTING FREE THE BEARS @it was worth every minute it took to read it!John IRVING has such detail @imagination.Reading this story will make you a fan of all things John Irving@you will want to know all of his characters.
2,Bland and Puerile,"Beyond the obvious titillation of this novel, there is little to be said for this work. Irving masks his lack of skill as a writer by simply going over the top with his characters and situations. He is like a magician trying to distract us from seeing the real action going on, which in the case of his work, is unimaginative and boring. The novel has serious moral flaws. He cavalier in mentioning violence, as if it is just a bit of backdrop, ignoring the shattering implication of this in the life of women. There are Irvings gag names, his fixation with wresting, his ""imaginative"" flights of fancy which are little more than filler. Any interesting observations he has about life and love are buried in the ground of his compulsions."
5,Can't wait to dig in!!!!!!!,"A funny, charming and delicious book. Nothing rrruffff about it. Gillespie and Sampson have completely won me over with their narrative and recipes."
3,Entertaining,"The author was entertaining, however, I would probably not have purchased this book had I looked at it in a store."
1,did not work,"this product did not work for me at all. I bought two of them and used them all and i saw no change. besides them not working, the horrible herbal smell seeped though my skin and came out though my urine and feces."
3,"A well-written, readable book","Robert Asprey writes well, and convincingly. This is a very entertaining book, on a subject that is not well-worn in the English language. He has written a competent History of the German High Command, exposing them where they deserve it, and those who read it will better understand how and why the allies won. If there is a criticism to be made, it is that he glosses over some important points, or fails to go into enough detail, or smoothly avoids the real issues. He also should more carefully document some of his statements. For all this, it is a worthwhile book. Alan Culpin Austin, Texas. Western Front Assoc."
2,Pretty hokey by today's standards,"""Westworld"" scared the living crap out of me when I was a kid. My how things have changed. I saw it again recently and laughed at how hokey it is. Sure, its a great sci-fi concept (imagine a place where you could live out your fantasies with androids attending to your every whim), but the filmakers didn't have much of a budget to really pull it off. Actually, this would be a good movie for Hollywood to remake as a summertime blockbuster with a $100 million dollar or so budget. Yul Brynner probably enjoyed hamming it up as the gunfighter in this film, but the movie itself has not aged well at all."
2,Gimmick as story,"Somebody running away from something scary in a gimmicky setting with twists and turns; that's Westworld. One-dimensional characters, inane dialogue, cheesy costumes, predictable machine goes berzerk ""story"", and generic sets are the essentials that provide the thrills in this over-long movie. Like a majority of scary movies and the stories from which they are derived, the premise is to pile very contrived problems onto the harried protagonist trapped in a ""Bloodybones is on the first step-Bloodybones is on the second step-Bloodybones is on the third step..."" dilemma (Michael Crichton and Stephen King are the masters of the genre}. There's nothing new under the sun and there's nothing new in Westworld."
4,Westworld - A good little Movie,I am a person who likes Science Fiction. This movie Kind of is and is kind of Not. It still is a good movie in it's own way. I really like Futureworld. A step beyond Westworld.
4,STILL A GOOD MOVIE!,"It's thirty years since I saw this movie and yes it's dated visually but still a great story, and still scary too! Yul Bryner is excellent as the robot gunman. Good adventure ... my teenage sons thought it was really cool!"
5,Angel's Best album,"Far and away the hardest and heaviest of Angel's first five studio albums.I'm curious to hear their new release albeit without several key members. Glad to see these released on cd, however Live Without A Net, On Earth As It Is In Heaven and Sinful albums are almost impossible to find on disc. Wassup?"
5,This albumn woke up a sleeping side of my soul,"Ive never heard music like this before. The third song on the alubmn, Tunula Eno, fills me with tears and joy everytime I hear it. Samite fills his music with raw, beautiful emotion and has the uncanny ability to remind the listener of the strength and intense beauty that lies within all of us. This albumn touches deeply."
5,African muscian's CD,"This musician is a master of the ""thumb piano"" and the music is authentic and well done."
2,not much here,"This is the first Barker that I've bothered to pick up. First, the good points: The original idea is great, and the author is at his best with his excellent phrasing.But, the characters were so shallowly drawn and the plot executed in such a mediocre fashion that I found myself no longer interested _at all_ a little after half way through the book. I was carried through the first half simply by Barker's style. But, truth be told, I really didn't care what happened to any of the characters or whether either of the worlds that Weaveworld ""explores"" vanished forever with no trace. It's been sitting, unfinished, for a month and will remain so permanently. Forgettable indeed. ;-)"
3,Made me long for The Books of Blood again.,"Barker goes heavy on plot and description, writing with a verbosity I don't remember encountering in his short work, but skimps on the characterisation. I really didn't care about or feel I knew any of the people in the story. The wordiness made reading a little tedious and I soon became anxious just to finish the book. Where Barker excels is in his unique, horrific imagination and there are a few scenes that shine, such as the introduction of the Rake, and the discovery and assault of the Scourge. But there wasn't enough in here to satisfy me. I can't recommend either for or against reading 'Weaveworld' as it wasn't *bad*, and apparently a lot of people loved it, but I thought it was just fair."
5,We should to play it!,"One of the greatest book, what i read...im often play rpg [live], and after this book my first mind was a WOW, and the second one: WE SHOULD TO PLAY THIS GAME! Everybody, who think the same, or who would like to help me...please mail me!Regards, Krisztian"
4,The Never Ending Story,"I almost didn't read it because of the reference to ""Horror"" on the cover, but to me, it didn't fit that category. It was more imaginative than that- better than I thought it could be. In fact, I don't know where or when I bought the book, but I was getting books off to the used book sellers when I needed a novel, and there it was. I could put it down, but I picked it up regularly over the 5 days or so it took to read."
1,Yet Another Boring SF Version of the Frankenstein Myth,"This is yet another boring SF version of the Frankenstein's monster myth. Nothing interesting is added. The only plot ""twist"" is predictable and obvious. The happily ever after ending is not credible. The technology is superficial and illogical."
1,Not As Advertised,I was looking for some gym shorts for my little girl. These said they were for children. The shorts were adult size. I was stuck with them as to ship them back would cost more that I paid for them. I threw them in the garbage.
5,Great exercize shorts,"Originally bought Soffe shorts for gymnastics many years ago. They are cool, allow freedom of movement and fit enables them not to get caught on equipment or spotters. Now wear them daily for walking, lounging and sleeping--very comfortable."
3,Athletic shorts,The only problem is I think they run just a little smaller than other athletic shorts in the size small.
3,ok for around the house,these shorts run small and the elastic in the waistband is not very nice quality - kinda stiff and chunky. For athletis shorts to be worn exercising or working in the yard they are acceptable but they look cheap and I wouldn't wear them in public.
2,Even the LARGE is too small for a child,"I ordered 4 pairs of LARGE, and the shorts are way too small -- might fit a 10 year old!"
3,No white band,"Like the shorts except the pictures show a white waist band, and you only get that if you turn over the top."
5,SUCH A GREAT ALBUM!!!!,"this is a great album to get if your new to James. a awesome album from beginning to end.have no fear. this album is beautiful, loud, and fantastic.if your new to James. this is the best album to begin with. enjoy it."
2,Spoiled brat & rude guardian behave selfishly.,"Georgette Heyer is my FAVORITE author. Bath Tangle is my least favorite of her books. The Mistress of Manners has created two individuals who will annoy the heck out of you. They are uniformly selfish, childish, bad-mannered, ungracious and everything that Miss Heyer's usual characters are not. Bet they got divorced before the year was out. However, as always, the period is perfect and the dialogue outstanding. I love Heyer even when I don't like her characters."
4,a Tangle,Wow! What a tangled web we weave when we...wrong story. Another one of Heyer's delightful misadventures. Leaves you wondering how things will ever get untangled. A lovely read.
3,It works,"For everything you get, it's a great deal. The CD player has no skip protection at all, but it can take falls and beatings very well. The mini speakers are good to have around and they, too, stand up to beatings."
4,"COBY RATING with reservations""","In all I am very pleased with the Coby CD player. However, that beingsaid, I have reservations about the accompanied accessories.1. The ear plugs are very uncomfortable.2. The exterior speakers are tinny.To counter both deficiencies I went out and purchased a Bose QC3.Problems solved. However these two lapses should be considered whenpurchasing the setup, unless pricing can make up for the deficienciesso the customer feels they got a special deal."
5,Perfection!,"I've always used Stant as replacement parts on cars and trucks, and I was pleasantly surprised when I found this one for the old Honda Goldwing I'm restoring. That, plus the great price at Amazon.com, and it's perfection!"
1,dead after <200hrs,Bought this from amazon because I thought OEM part would be more reliable and amazon would stand behind it...Wrong..dead after 5 months . Amazon doesn't take returns after 30 days and directed me to NEC who never answered my email. This time I'm going with a knock off which is much cheaper and comes with a 6 month warranty from the seller. Total rip off on this item from amazon..for that price a faulty product should be replaced.
2,won't be traveling with michelle in the future,2 good songs does not a good cd make.good listening to those of you who venture out with this one.
1,dictionar englez-roman si roman-englez,"I-mi car scuze ca va deranjez,eu nu stiu prea bine engleza si nu am nici bani pentru a-mi procura un dictionar. Va rog sa-mi spuneti si mie de unde pot sa iau si eu un dictionar care sa-l pun pe calculator ? Va multumesc!"
4,"Good, and Should Have Been Great","I purchased this book with the appetite of a shark after a seal. It is a very good book, but it has a couple of things that could have improved it beyound measure. 1. There are so many remarkable men in all navies and battles that the reader needs something to distinquish them after the years of war. 2. I wanted more details on the battles, perhaps some diagrams. 3. I would have liked to have known more about what happened to these men after the wars. Cochrane, as an example, died the year the american civil war started. But not to quibble, this is a good book that puts it all together. You just stay hungry."
1,Sandwich Smandwich---Three reasons not to read this book.,Reason #1. There are no sandwiches in the book that you can eat.Reason #2. Not enough sandwich humor...i.e. sandwich/pastrami jokes.Reason #3. Phil Sanborn is a tool.
5,Roadside Geology of Wisconsin,"I have several of the Roadside Geology Series and have found them to be very readable for a novice, and Wisconsin is no exception.As usual I got it after the fact, and wish I had it before. Our trip would have been that much more interesting if I had known all the interesting things I know now.I highly recomend any and all Roadside Geology books."
3,"In response to ""Gloin of Bag End""'s scathing criticism","I have not even read this book, but I am defending it as an example of parodies everywhere. You seem not to understand why people write parodies. Parodies are not written because someone hated the books or wanted to disrespect them. They write them because they have read them enough times to poke fun at every aspect of them."
3,Ahem...,"There should be two sets of reviews for this book: Loved it, or Hated it. This isn't a review column anymore, but a bunch of people fighting over a guy who died a long time ago. I liked it, but I also liked LOTR. I am not a fanatic of either one. I do not consider either great, nor stupid or filthy. Can we leave it at that?"
3,bdgluvr181 Probably Has Nothing To Say,"I haven't actually read bdgluvr181's review below, but I bet if I did I'd find plenty not to like.He probably has a lot of comments based on guesswork and ignorance. If I took the time to read his ill-advised review of Bored of The Rings, I'd probably hate it.Seriously?I find it (a) hilarious that somebody feels any piece of literature is beyond reproach; (b) surprising that this dude (for surely it's a guy) doesn't recognize that parody is almost always a sign of flattery. A loving tribute written in the form of barbed-wire prose; (c) comical that someone actually felt compelled to write a negative review of a book he hasn't read. I'd like to see this trend expanded to The New York Times Book Review (""Probably a Classic!"")"
2,Bored of the book...,"I was expecting so much more from the Harvard Lampoon- ""Nightlight"" and ""The Hunger Pains"" were both rolling-on-the-floor hysterical. Maybe because this was an earlier effort and the parodies keep improving as they continue? At any rate, this parody was inferior to the other two mentioned."
2,Bored of this Book.,"A stupid and silly spoof on the Lord of the Rings books. With some idiotic humor (that is funny in some placed), this book did not keep me interested. It tries to humorize the epic story of Lord of the Rings with exagerated discriptions of its characters. With every old joke that has been heard a million times, this book tries so hard to humor intellegent people.The only people that would find this book any good, are simple people that hate Lord of the Rings and that have a very high sence of humor.An idiotic book for easily amused people."
2,the best i can say about it is that it got more people to,"read the lord of the rings. The book was cleverly worded. I just hope that Tolkien was dead when this was written, even if he wasn't he probably would of turned over is his grave."
2,Two-star insults!,"I began reading ""Bored of the Rings"" with great expectations (a mistake?), but soon was bitterly disappointed. Since the book is some dozen times shorter than the work of literature it parodies, the text is a summary of LotR at best. Because of this underwhelming lack of structure, the writing moves clumsily. Although the authors were certainly successful in making fun of the characters' names, they made the mistake of making everything into a tasteless gag. The truly humorous parts are few and far between, and to get to them you must find your way past unfunny oxymorons, senseless one-liners, and odd, but certainly not entertaining descriptions. Sure it's worth a read- if you aren't afraid of poking fun at great literature, that is- but only the patient few will have the nerve to get through the lewd misadventures of these hapless, reptilian boggies."
1,Bored of the Rings,"This is example of how not to do a parody. They go in for a lot of cheap and easy jokes, especially cheap and tasteless sex jokes. I'm not a hardcore LOTR fan, and I'm not offended or angered by the parody; I just think that the potential of this book was squandered. There was the potential for a lot of big laughs, but for that to happen you need writers of talent."
4,Oddball Epic,"If you've ever wondered what ""The Lord of The Rings"" might be like if written by the 1960s version of Mad Magazine, this book is for you. It's short, vulgar, cluttered with pop culture references, and totally disrespectful to the source material.In other words, this is what comic satire ought to be.If you don't share my sense of humor, you won't find this funny but this is one of those books that I couldn't stop laughing at when I first read it and I still find it hilarious several readings later. If you have just a passing familiarity with the Lord of the Rings novels, you'll get most of the jokes so don't worry about it being too esoteric and precious. Just roll with it and laugh along with the ridiculous and often Pythonesque comedy."
4,Bored of the Rings- Just what you'd expect,"Well, if you're a fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and don't mind poking a bit of tasteless fun at the classic literary genius of Tolkien, this book might just be for you. It needs to be read in smaller doses in order for the continuous barrage of bad puns and jokes not to get TOO old to you, but in such smaller bites the book is indeed enjoyable.Some of the jokes are a bit dated (remember this book was written over 30 years ago) but you still get the drift. It's exactly what you'd expect from a ""Lampoon"" type of product. Overall I'd say this is worth reading. You'll at least get a chuckle or two if not full-on guffaws."
2,Same as Standup,"If you've heard his standup routine or watched the tv show, don't bother wasting your time on the book - it's the same material, only drier. Save a few bucks & get the stand up routine alone if you're a fan."
3,It was a great comedy that very was funny and entertaining.,His book was pretty much about his life and hilarious things that have happened through out. It keeps ypu very busy and is a good entertainer.
3,Splits in the center,"This does what it's supposed to do. In that regard, it's a good product. But I have two significant gripes.First, the material the toy is made of attracts lint like moths to a porch light. It must be kept separate from other toys, and can't be used near anything fuzzy. It's annoying.Second, there is a seam running down the center that will begin to split if this is bent with any regularity. We will be replacing this with another, hopefully better, brand."
1,This book has no value,"I am a teacher in Colorado. Being interested in new ways to stimulate my students and inspire them to learn, I picked up this book. Although its message sounds good, it is in fact impractical and impossible to apply to the classroom without losing control of the students. It is obvious that the author made up many, if not all of these stories about his successes, because he is obviously a failed teacher. I pity all of the students he has taught."
2,Essther's Gift,"I found this book disappointing. After reading all of the Mitford Series and Father TIM and enjoying each one to the fullest...and looking forward to the next, this book just didn't measure up. Think I'll go back to looking for Mitford and my own Father Tim!"
1,Boring Waste of Time,"This was this first time I had read one of Mitford's books. While it is a quick read, it is also a dull and boring read -- not to mention a big waste of money. Read Grisham's Skipping Christmas for an uplifting, fun, and surprising Christmas story!"
1,Jan Karon is selling out,"The story here is almost too short to be called short. It is teensy. It took me 15 minutes to read it in a book store. Did I enjoy it. Yes. I love all the Mitford books. But, Jan Karon should be ashamed of herself for presenting this teensy story and recipe as a book. However, I bet she'll make big bucks selling this bitsy thing as a Christmas stocking stuffer. Don't waste you money--read it in a library or a bookstore. Jan Karon, Father Tim would not approve!"
1,"If a ""0"" star rating was possible...","DO NOT waste your money. Dull story that takes 15 minutes to read. Not at all interesting. The other Mitford books are worth rading, but not these short xmas ""specials""."
2,Barebones Suzuki,"In buying this book, I had hoped for considerable information about the underlying principles for the famed Suzuki method. I was disappointed greatly. Perhaps there is a cultural translation issue, but there seemed to be a dearth of theoretical and practical information. I will search for a more work that yields greater methodological insight."
3,Friends: Complete Eighth Season (2004),Friends: Complete Eighth Season (2004) i thing it is a little much for a 2004 season buy the kids wanted it
5,Friends Season Eight: A Pleasure,This is the first season that I saw completely. This season was very good. I have absolutely no qualms with watching it again and again.
1,Do not buy this one... get the UK version instead,"Why? Because you will not see the original episode 3 ""The One Where Rachel Tells..."" re-shot because of 9/11. The UK version has the removed portion on the DVD."
5,One of the best books i've ever read!,"This book was amazing! When i read the title i knew this book was going to be good. This book is funny and right when i got it i couldn't put it down. It took me less than a week to read it and I want to read it again.If you are looking for a gift, it would be great for someone who wants to be an actress or maybe someone who stands out from the rest.Lola is my hero and I'm so glad this book was written!"
5,This book is a movie now!,"I read this book about two- three years ago and it really was a interesting story. It wasn't untill the movie ""Connfessions of A Teenage Drama Queen"" that I remembered the book. I rented the movie and as i watched it, my mind started to put the story toghether. By the tail end of the movie i already knew what was going to happen at the end. The movie pretty much does the book justice, but so does Lindsey Lowhand who plays ""lola"". I suggest read the book , then rent the movie!"
5,Such a great book! now they have to ruin it...,"I totally looovveedd this book! Lola is so cool...wow good stuff but guess what? Lindsay Lohna (parent Trap, Freaky Friday, ya...) is gonna play Lola in the new movie Confessions of A Teenage Drama Queen! totally cool! NOT. o lord."
5,Still my favorite bass cd,"Without the tone of the instrument, you would never guess that a bass was playing at this level of precision. The pharisees of classical music who critique Meyer's performance for not sounding enough like a cello or not being Baroque enough is the equivalent of criticizing an apple for not tasting more like an orange. This cd is inspiring for any musician, but particularly for bassists tired of being relegated to simple droning on their instruments."
4,A Book Of Useful Hints,This book is well written by an author that seems to know quite alot about the subject. His writing style is very good. This book is well illustrated with many drawing and photos of the subject that is being discussed in the subject area that is being covered. I would recommend this book for the some what experienced modeler as the subject matter is presented in a way which assumes that the person reading the book knows the basics of the subject.
4,James Browns's 20 All-Time Greatest Hits!,"I had to get this album, somehow, and this is the format I got it in because ever since I were a child, I've danced to this album, so we have history. Thank God my mother figure (R.I.P) had this in her collection.I got this album as part of my outside entertainment so I have something to dance to and regale the people with.I'm an energetic guy, so depending on what the song is, if it's slow, I'm likely to turn it down; thus, give me all the energetic songs on here from ""Papa's Got A Brand New Bag Pt. 1"" to ""Get On The Good Foot Pt. 1."" And that's the thing that detracts from the quality of this album: all the parted songs are incomplete, which could tempt the listener to buy individual songs out of inconvenience. The only full song on here with parts is ""Super Bad.""Noteworthy beginner's collection of James Brown memorabilia."
4,YOU'VE GOT YOUR MONEY'S WORTH,"JAMES BROWN's sexual appeal has of course lost the ability to schock when gangster rap came around a few years ago.Still,he was the first one to use music as an exciting aphrodisiac,a sort of prelude before the act.I was always much more a WILSON PICKETT fan,because he is such a driving force.The problem with JAMES BROWN is that the lyrics just seem so futile that you could do without them.That package gives you the meat you asked for,just don't think about it too much.The grandfather of soul ,he remains a great performer;it is on stage so much more than in a recording studio ,that JAMES BROWN really comes alive."
5,Get on the Good Foot,"Whether he's being his bad self, getting on his good foot, searching for some getback, or getting down with his girlfriend, James Brown is hilarious. There's not a lot here musically except for a strong beat and funny lyrics to go with James's noises, but hey, it's James Brown, what else does anyone need? And this has all his hits - and all his noises.My favorite track is The Big Payback. He goes into how he needs some getback and how he doesn't know karate but he does know crazy. It's worth the price of the whole CD."
1,"Save your money, don't buy this!!","After a few days the cd stopped reading. Still the radio is working. In reallity I never expected to get a quality product for 35 bucks, so I'm not surprised."
3,Too Much Light!,"I usually listen to music as a go to sleep, and the only problem is that it generates lots of light. I solve this problem by putting a black pillowcase over it, but then I can't see what song is playing, which is usually alright, except for with new CDs. It also lacks essential features such as shuffling songs, an alarm, and a clock. Overall, it works great, but if you're planning on listening to it in the dark or as an alarm, there are better products out there."
4,Better than karaoke,"Beneath the ""pro vocal"" logo at the top of this book is a catchphrase, ""Better Than Karaoke!"". This time, I'm inclined to agree with the hype. When purchasing a music book / accompaniment CD set, it's easy enough to preview the printed music to ensure that the charts are faithful to the original version (and they are in this book). But when it comes to the included backtrack recording, it's the luck of the draw. In this instance, the accompaniment CD delivers nicely, with real or real-sounding instruments across the board (apart from synthesized strings). The CD is also enhanced for Mac and PC so that the key of the song can be altered without affecting the tempo. Nice touch! Chords and lyrics are included with the lead line. There are no guitar tabs."
3,mixed feelings.,"i never really understood the point of having someone deconstruct fanon, when the whole thrust of fanon was to deconstruct things to begin with. did this guy feel like fanon missed something? in defense, i know two cool people who really love this book. i guess for some, the language of bulhan is more in line with their thoughts. in defence, althought i personally feel fanon needs no further deconstruction, he can be hard to follow. fanon is like joyce. he is very deep, and his points penetrating and insightful, but it's more of a narrative in how it's constructed. i can allow that for some, to have it organized in this way, can be helpful."
4,Fair and well thought out.,I'm about two thirds of the way through the book and I have to say that it's well ballanced and well written. The author takes great care in presenting accurate and unbiased descriptions of the world's religions. I'd recommend it for anyone trying to gain an understanding of what each of these religions represent.
3,Reasonable,"I used this book for an independent study course on world religions. It was fairly user friendly and got me through ok, considering I only received a small amount of instructor time. Not something I would have selected on my own, but since I have it, I will keep it. Actually, if you were reading it for yourself and not fretting over an exam, it would be fairly interesting."
5,"An excellent, thoughtful book, gorgeously illustrated","I'm involved in a church class on world religions, and picked this as our text. It is an excellent book, well written, accessible, stimulating, and beautifully illustrated."
3,More nostalgia than instruction.,"The subject more difficult than it looks, mainly owing to the variety of scorecard layouts and symbols involved (all entirely subjective). But whatever the system, the scorecard should document the the game sufficiently to record the statistics of the players, and in this, the book fails. Not a word about fielding averages, e.g., but still fun."
5,Sinus infection,This products works really well for me when I have a sinus infections coming on. I get relief from the pain the same day I start using the spray.
5,The GIG continues...,"Now that Section 9 is up and running again, their skill can be put to good use. Crisis is growing in Japan as whispers of war and need for independence rise out of the refugees, after the Refugees Special Treatment Act is repealed. While at the same time it seems members of the special self-defense force have their own plans. And what roll does the Individual 11 play in the whole scheme...This DVD set includes the following:2 Discs:Disc 1 - 4 episodes in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound (English and Japanese)Disc 2 - 4 episodes in DTS (English and Japanese)Episodes:1.

DO NOT BUY!"
3,Not a great but at times Clever Thriller.,"A Professional Hit-Man by the name of Robert Rath (Sylvester Stallone) finds himself haunted after a Hit goes wrong. Another Professional Hit-Man named Bain(Antonio Banderas) targets him as an unwanted rival but things get complicated, when Robert gets involved with an attractive Computer Hacker (Julianne Moore).Directed by Richard Donner (Lethal Weapons Series) shows a stylish thriller but It`s also a slow moving thriller. It`s a huge Box Office disapointment back in 1995, despite a few good action scenes and a sense of humor. The film is Written by Andy & Larry Wachowski (The Matrix Trilogy) and Brian Helgeland (A Knight`s Tale). It`s worth a look. Grade:B."
5,Number One With A Bullet,"We would have to recommend this to any fan of Sly, or Antonio. Julianne Moore was a wonderful supporting actress as well. We had a hard time deciding who to root for. The entire movie was classic Sly, and a nice surprise regarding Mr. Banderas in his early years. Action, fun, intrigue and the usual cat and mouse. But with excellent delivery. Well made, perfectly pulled off. I had to give it a five star rating for those reasons."
4,Spaceland...,"Spaceland is a good science fiction book, but it doesn't appear to be much more than that. Overall, the book as a whole is a good read, but for those who are looking for something which is more of the tune of Flatland, you would probably be better off looking for a different book. The twist in the entire story is probably one of the best ""scientific"" reasoning which make it plausible, but it could have been expanded better."
4,Brilliant music,"This album tells a very lose story. To fully understand it you need to watch the movie. The music, however, is top notch. It is full of powerful songs such as Give Blood and Second Hand Love. Because it is a concept album, it has more flavor that an album that is just a collection of songs (something like Who's Next)All in all this album is an excellent album, and deserves a place in everyone's music collection"
4,Owwww!!! Good God!!!! It'll make you feel good!!!!!,If you like James Brown you'll love this CD. Its one of his best compilations of the recent years. Gett Up Offa That Thing/Dr. Detroit is especially good and a very rare song to find. Granted its not his best work but its good. I think any true fan will enjoy this CD!
4,A Good Mystery,"While its portrayal of Icelanders may not be spot on, this book is a good one if you like a good, intelligent mystery."
4,The most complete guide to American sterling silver patterns,"Ms. Hagan's ""Sterling Flatware"", revised second edition is a must have book for any silver pattern matcher or anyone seriously interested in American sterling silver flatware. This book contains several hundred more patterns than the ""Jewelers Keystone"" pattern matching book and is a vast improvement over the Authers's First edition.There are some disadvantages. The first is that after minor use, the pages will fall out. This can be remedied by puting the pages into plastic sleaves and than into a 3 ring binder. The second disadvantage is that line drawings are used instead of photographs. This often makes it a little more difficult to identify a pattern.Still this has to be the book of choice for myself and other professionals in this field.... Marc Cutcher / Solomon Enterprises, Inc."
4,EXACT same phone as the 600B - 50 # directory,"Actually, I haven't bought one yet; I just wanted Amazon shoppers to know that this one has a 50-number directory, just like the KX-TS600B... the ONLY difference between the two are the colors - black or white. Makes one wonder why one got 3.5 stars and the other 4?!"
1,Not Happy with Kindle version,I downloaded this book on my Kindle and you cannot even read the book at all. A waste of money if getting it for your Kindle. Hard to rate a book that you can't see on the Kindle
3,The Iceman is great. This compilation is not,"While Jerry Butler is great, this selection leaves too much to be desired.The early work with The Impressions (including the doo-wop classic ""Your Precious Love"") is missing. So is the Henry Mancini classic ""Moon River"". Ditto ""Make It Easy On Yourself"", and his seminal duet with Betty Everett ""Let It Be Me"". Without these, the Anthology is incomplete, and to leave these out of a two disc set is inexcusable.For me, Amazon's offering The Best of Jerry Butler is a better buy and has much more of his great work."
5,Great booster wax,"I use NXT paste wax a lot and like its look on reds and dark paints. This spray wax gives the same look and will bring back the just waxed look. Spray onto a folded microfiber and then spread thin over the car, let haze and wipe off with a dry towel. I had zero streaking and it was super easy and quick to wipe off when using this method. Much quicker than regular liquid and paste NXT and will last a month or better on its own."
4,Gave it to my son.,"We loved the movie, my son was grateful at Christmas. he said he had just searched this out on Utube not long ago."
4,"Great music, but find me Tender Years !!","Great CD, but where is Tender Years? They need to re-issue this and the original Eddie, bringing back Tender Years. That song is hot. Someone tell me: do those import versions have it?"
2,Lost and Found,"If you have followed and enjoyed the movies chronicling the fictional rock band, Eddie and the Cruisers - Eddie and the Cruisers (1983) & Eddie and the Cruisers II: Eddie Lives (1989) - then the CD may be a means to bring the story to an audio conclusion.Issued in 1991, it is the ""unreleased tapes"" that was a major part of the storyline in the first movie. John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band again portray Eddie and the Cruisers, but these recordings have a more unpolished sound of a demo tape, in an obvious way to closely follow the movie scripts.For the uninitiated, the 49 seconds of Eddie's Confession will be nothing short of puzzling, since it explains the major mystery which would only be known by watching the movies. And with the total running time of a few ticks under 30 minutes, this may ultimately be an unsatisfying game of lost and found."
3,Resourceful but disappointing,"I had been avidly awaiting the release of this book. But I came away from it uninterested and unmoved.I had expected, based on the description, something that was part ""Lifestyle's of the Rich and Famous""and part mealplanner with recipes. The latter was as promised in every sense. The former consisted of an enormous display of what I can only describe as a painfully awkward attempt to portray a glamour and beauty that had faded and an importance by association rather than accomplishment. I would think that such a reknowned hostess could have supplied a far more impressive narration.To buy or not to buy? Buy. The meals look scrumptious and the recipes are items that look gourmet and taste gourmet but can be replicated with skills of an amateur. (Like me.)"
5,You may find yourself re-reading this book several times !,"The first time I read this book, I felt a great sense of relief knowing that I wasn't the only parent living this nightmare. I can honestly say that I believe the stress created by my drug-addicted son would have killed me had I not kept coming back to this book and eventually acted on the advice given. I am healthier, wiser and stronger than I have been in years."
5,Thank you!,"What a blessing, I felt very alone and lost. This book was such a comfort to me in the horrendous situation I found myself in. Every parent should read if dealing with addicted children!!"
5,awesome buy,great for the rocky fans espicially me rocky 4 is one of my favorite movies of all time no micheal bay film can compete
5,"This time, you can Believe The Hype!","This is a book I was convinced I would enjoy when I heard about it's publication, yet feared over the past few weeks. Press send-offs like that enjoyed by Mr. Fox in the last few weeks tend to diminish the enjoyment of any memoir, and Michael has been all over the press like cheap cologne lately. Having said that, it took me a day and a half to read ""Lucky Man"", and I was sad that it ended so quickly. Rarely have such tragic circumstances (Parkinson's, alcoholism...) be portrayed with such an ""I can take it all on"" attitude. The side characters (Tracey Pollen, preious castmates...) are skillfully described. And you just know by the end of the book that there lies a BIG 2nd (or 3rd or 4th) act in Michael's immediate future.You'll probably trip over a lot of people reading this on the beach this summer. That's all good, for there is a lot of ""uplift"" in this story. Bravo, MJF, for sharing with the rest of us."
4,Lucky man,An honest review of his life. Good for anyone dealing with Parkinson's.Everyone would enjoy this book. Read it on kindle.
4,Interesting Read,"Lucky Man is an interesting read - a well-written celebrity biography with a serious side. Fox writes very well - excellent style and vocabulary - and is candid about the impact of Parkinson's Disease on his life. Since his struggle with the disease and his acting career are both on-going, the book did not have a strong finish, but I found it insightful and worthwhile. I never read celebrity books but read this one because I admire Fox's candor about his illness."
5,Honest and Intelligent,A man who is gifted in so many ways. Intelligently and honestly written. Kept my interest from beginning to end.
5,Touching memoir by a brave man,"I found this book to be very insightful...at times funny, at times sad. I felt like I got to know the man, Michael J. Fox, and I appreciated his journey. Written in his words and told as only he could tell it...very nice job."
3,Hopeful,"I have always enjoyed the roles played by Michael J. Fox, so I wanted to know more of the man behind them. This book accomplishes that purpose. I am impressed by his grace under pressure and his willingness to go public with his private pain to try to help other sufferers. I normally read fiction, but I choose nonfiction for very specific reasons. This book is interesting, fairly well written, and certainly worth reading. I am hopeful that those who suffer this cruel disease will have a cure sooner through increased attention and research spurred through the author's efforts."
4,Inspiring,I really enjoyed the honest portrail of what it must be like to find out you have a life altering disease.
5,A Well Written and Courageous Story,"Reading about a person who has an incurable illness can be a real downer for most of us, especially if it's a celebrity that we really admire, but this book does just the opposite. It not only carries us along but leaves us with a hopeful feeling at the end. It is a chronicle of Michael's fight with PD and his life before and after becoming a big TV and movie celebrity. His sense of humor and positive outlook on life is always evident as we discover how he deals with his disease personally and with the adoring public, his family and fellow workers and the ever-present, prying media. Besides giving us a great insight into that privileged world of Hollywood it shows us that even those special people who seem to live fantasy lives also have problems that money cannot always solve. For anyone experiencing bad times personally or helping another with their troubles this book should help you find hope and courage while still entertaining you. It sure did for me."
5,Loved it!,"I don't normally read autobiographies, but a friend of mine had read Lucky Man and recommended the book. I was hooked right away, I loved Michael's honesty about his feelings and all the ups and downs he encountered while managing his newly acquired celebrity status as well as learning he had PD. I thoroughly enjoyed his book and definitely recommend it. Now I want to watch Back to the Future again!!"
4,Lucky man,I felt the book was brutally honest...something you don't see very often especially with many people in the public eye. It gave me insight into accepting an illness that cannot be changed. Go Michael J. Fox!
2,Textbook for TWC431-TWC531 online class at ASU,"This book was used for the TECHNICAL EDITING online class for Arizona State University. I would call it an obsolete textbook. From 1992, it has no real usable technology information, only information about basic editing techniques. But that's what they chose for teaching this course, so if you're taking this class, you're stuck with it. Enjoy! :-)"
2,Would not recommend,"Hard to reference simple grammer rules, e.g., how to use quotaion marks. Too much information on how to document computer language. Not what I expected and not what I want...can I return this book?"
5,Excellent Resource on Technical Editing,"For several years of my technical writing career, I had the pleasure of having Judy Tarutz edit my manuals. At that time, Judy was a supremely gifted editor, but her wonderful book did not yet exist. Her excellent book is the culmination of many years of experience and has become the standard reference on technical editing. I totally disagree with the previous reviewer in giving this book two stars (and leaving typos in the review to boot). Judy's book is a five-star book found on the bookshelves of many professional writers and editors in the computer field."
5,The Hot Chick- Best comedy of 2002-2003,"Well, I have seen this comedy and it's funny and great. Absolutely recommended! You'll regret not to own its DVD. Rob Schneider has done a remarkable job in this comedy but you'll feel the pretty girl Rachel Adam misses out most of the scene except from the very beginning. The whole film just put everything on Rob Schneider. Rachel Adam is almost not there(a little setback)."
5,Non-Stop Laughter,"I loved this movie. It had me laughing from begining to end. Its one of those movies that you don't have to think about. You just sit back and enjoy. I love everything that Rob Schneider does and in my opinion this is his best movie yet. If you loved his earlier films, you''l defeinitely love this one."
2,Stupid if warm one-joke comedy strikes some appeal,"Hot Chick, The (2002) Rob Schneider, Rachel McAdams, Anna Faris, Matthew Lawrence, Eric Christian Olsen, Robert Davi, Melora Hardin, Alexandra Holden, Sam Doumit, Tia Mowry, Tamera Mowry, Adam Sandler, D: Tom Brady. Low-humored duplicate of FREAKY FRIDAY-a Happy Madison production, about a thirty-something bandit waking up in the bed of a popular, cold fish cheerleader due to a pair of magical earrings from Abyssinia that has the power to switch bodies. You've seen it done many times before and many times better than this. Lackadaisical comedy can be amiable and tepid . . . but tries too hard to be funny with dopey and offensive jokes. And Brady wrote and directed films at Harvard? Schneider co-wrote and Sandler co-produced. Running Time: 101 minutes and rated PG-13 for crude and sexual humor, language, and drug references."
3,Great to whet the appetite for a Safari,"I found this book great to whet the appetite for safari, but once I decided where I wanted to go, I found the detailed information lacking. It's great for a broad overview of LOTS of places though.. but needs to be used in conjunction with other more specific travel guides."
3,Is he marrying her for revenge?,"From back cover: Newly arrived in Manhattan, Lisa Hayward meets Thornton Landers, a sexy multimillionaire with seduction on his mind! Lisa tries to keep Thorn at a distance, but it proves impossible. Swept off her feet by his ruthless charm and powerful persuasion, she agrees to marry him - only to discover, too late, that Thorn has a darker motive for his proposal: revenge! Thorn's family had been devasted by Lisa's brother. Now Thorn finally has the chance to repay some of the pain he suffered. But can he really go through with it?"
5,I love this shampoo!,"I purchased this shampoo after a friend informed me that yucca would help my hair stop thinning. My hair had become stringy and thinned so much I didn't even look like myself. The company shipped very quickly, I received the package before the stated date. When I first started using this shampoo it was hard to get used to the fact that it doesn't lather like a regular shampoo. I thought ""Oh yeah, like this will get my hair clean"". BUT I was delightfully suprised when I dried my hair and it was more manageable. It looked cleaner than it had ever looked and not near as much was in the sink or the brush. Now, weeks later, my husband even commented on how great my hair was looking and he even started using the shampoo. I came back to order more today and will continue to use this product."
3,Une nouvelle mouture des fameux Guides Bleus.,"La tradition d'érudition un peu austère des Guides Bleus Hachette est mise à mal dans cette édition honnte mais sans plus. Le voyageur visitant pour la première fois notre région trouvera le nécessaire, pas le superflu ni ce supplément d'me qui faisait des Guides Bleus une référence absolue."
5,Garage Storage Lift,The Racor Heavy lift is a very good product. We have a high ceiling in our garage and the lift works very well to storage items that are sometimes heavy to lift up high.
4,It's OK,"I installed 3 of these in my garage. They are good, because you can get a lot of stuff off your garage floor. I installed them by myself and that made it somewhat difficult. You need to be a little handy, but not a handyman to install them. They don't hang squarely, because of the way they are designed and the safety locks on 2 of mine don't stay engaged. If I had to do it over I might not go this route, but I have so many hours invested in them I'm not going to remove them. They were installed 2 years ago."
5,Very Awesome Storage Unit!,"This product did exactly what we needed. We live in and area where ice fishing is a winter activity, the only problem is you can only fish about 4 months of the year. We needed a place to store our portable fish houses during the rest of the year so I started looking for storage units. All of the ones sold in the stores were permanent ceiling fixtures so you would have to get the fish house up there some how in order to store it up there. The nice thing with the Racor is you can load the fish house on it at waist level and hoist it up with a drill. It takes very little muscle to use it. Everyone that sees it thinks it's a great idea. I would recommend this product for anyone looking to get their garage space back."
2,Cable-lifted storage rack,"THE ROTOR LOOP METAL, WHERE IT HOOKS TO THE TURN SHAFT, WEARS OUT QUICKLY, THE MORE WAIT THE FASTER IT WEARS OUT. THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL FAILURE FOR THE DURABILITY AND OPERATION OF THIS PRODUCT.ALTHOUGH IT'S RATED CAPACITY OF 250 LB THE COMPONENTS DO NOT SUPPORT DURABILITY. THIS PRODUCTS WOULD BE EXCELLENT FOR 75 LB."
5,Works great- just watch the install videos first,"Works great- I use my drill to raise and lower the platform. You'll want to remove the nylon rollers before you begin hanging it on your ceiling though. Nothing in the instructions about that. Otherwise, common sense and the video install instructions will make it a 2-2.5 hour installation. Almost bought a second one, but ended up buying a fixed rack that I can slide stuff from this platform over onto the fixed rack, and back to bring it down."
4,Good product for the money,"The lift works as advertised. I would agree with others that the heads on the bolts that come with the lift easily can be torked off, but if your careful they'll work ok. (Racor obviously knows this, because it is the only hardware in the box they send you a few extra of).It does take a while to install - this is not a 20 minute project.The lift itself does the trick."
2,Worse than IKEA,"All I have to say is that as easy as this looks to install from the marketing.....well it's not. I ordered two of these things and have them still sitting on the garage floor because I have to get a board to mount to the ceiling so the mounting hardware that was supposed to mount to the ceiling directly can actually work. I also have to get some new bolts that are actually threaded, I understand these are mass produced but have some kind of quality control if customers aren't even able to use the hardware included to put together your product. I actually have at least 3 of the nuts that have zero threading on them so how am I supposed to use that?To say the least this is a cheap setup for the price they charge and especially in the quality of the material. I can't speak for how it works because I havent been able to get to the hardware store yet to finish building these things.There has to be better products out there!"
4,Nice Storage Solution,"Shipment came double boxed with no damage. I watched the online video which was somewhat helpful. The instructions are not clear, as the the bottom grids can be installed two ways. No problem just check the picture on the box, but they had one metal grid going one way and the other the opposite. I installed 2x3's with 3"" lag bolts to the ceiling joists and then used the included hardware to mount the cross bars to the 2x3's. For some reason the side with the crank assembly was higher, so I had to loosen the cable clamps to level the platform. Loaded the platform with about 200 lbs and cranked it up. I will have to invest in an 5/8 drill as cranking the platform up is a real workout. Total time spent was about 5 hours. Well worth the investment."
1,Warning - Dangerous,"Worked great for the first year of ownership. Installed per instructions then one day the worm drive tension system gave way when my father was lowering the unit using the supplied crankshaft. It caught the corner of his forearm and tore his skin pretty badly. I used it with my HD drill and had no problem. I used it again with the crankshaft and had no problem. I then went back to the drill and it happened to me as well. It now just sits up there, locked, until I figure out what to replace it with or how to repair it safely."
1,Poor quality and missing hardware,"Very poor quality, holes were not drilled correctly in the supports for j-bolts to go through. They were uneven down one of the bars. Came with 15 j-bolts I assume because they were very poor quality and the threads were pre stripped on half of them but given the extra bolts I was shorted 5 nuts. Still cannot wire racks to fasten securely after reading several other reviews I am off to the hardware store to just replace all the hardware as I am now worried about the poor quality of the screws to hold it to the ceiling."
3,"Good idea, but poor parts. I'd buy again.","The concept is great. I enjoy not having to get on a ladder and bring heavy items down over my head. The drill connection is good but by hand is fine too. It isn't ""easy"" but considering there is +200 pounds on mine I wasn't expecting it to be easy. It takes about 30-45 sec to raise or lower. I'd recommend a female use the drill though. Getting level and plumb was a pain. I had to redrill some of the holes and I used plywood on top of the grates for stability. I also used a few extra lag bolts that I bought because ...the thing is holding +200 pounds over my truck. I figured it was worth a couple bucks in bolts just to make extra sure it wasn't coming down. I'd buy another. It does take a good hour or so to put together but I did it alone."
4,Great Lift,We have two of them in our garage to safe space. Works great the bolts on the other hand are made of poor quality and I would reccomend that you purchase new ones prior to installing this. I would have giving 5 stars except for the bolts.
2,TOO SMALL,THESE WERE REALLY TOO SMALL. THEY DON'T COVER MY NOSE AND MOUTH COMPLETELY. I DON'T HAVE A LARGE FACE SO I DON'T KNOW WHO THESE WERE MADE FOR. THEY WOULD WORK FOR CHILDREN. I WILL TRY ANOTHER BRAND NEXT TIME.
1,"not good, very difficult to breathe in","Although the quality feels strong, the mask itself is not good. It has a chemical smell to it. The main problem with the mask is that it's very hard to breathe in it. There's not must air flow inside the mask so every time you breathe, your breath gets blown upward into your eyes. If you wear goggles, your breath will fogged it all up and you wouldn't be able to see through it."
4,Good quality disposable masks.,This is an economical way to get a supply of decent quality basic general purpose masks. They are pre-strung with elastic bands and have a metal pinch strip across the nose to allow for some fit customizing. They are not rated for hazardous materials nor are they meant for anything but for use in well ventilated areas and non-toxic materials. Those who are allergic to dust withh find these to be a good option. I use them for cleaning when I'm working on items such as ceiling fan blades and mini blinds. I even wear one when I clean out the litter box so that the dust that is generated doesn't end up in my lungs and mouth. They are designed with a slightly lower profile so that they can easily be work with glasses or safety goggles.
2,the lost archives appear to be still lost,The footage in this film is fantastic but in no way whatsoever does justice to what the individuals who participated in the war experienced. Unlike the Land of the Czars or other films produced this production does not provide enough detail for any of the events listed in the contents. It is almost like fast forwarding through the war. There is no way i would subject my students to this film. I would be boring them to death and I would here about it.The purchase of this dvd was a total waste of money. I would sooner use many of the dusty copies in our library.pjk
4,Shaking away,The puppies like to grab it and swing it then they try to play take away.It is holding up well
4,interesting,"This was one of the more interesting books I've read, for sure. It is very detailed and ties in a lot, linking everything to...sex. As someone whose interested in human behavior, this was a fascinating book that tied in my interests in anthropology, psychology, and biology, and sex of course."
2,Kind of complicated,"I don't recommend if you want a simple book detailing sex and human nature. This book is kind of complicated, which is fine if I were reading it for a class. Not a casual read"
1,Does not stick,"I would like to start with the good. My 3 year old son, whom has a fascination for construction vehicles, absolutely loves the border.Now for the real. I have 3 boys, and have gone through many bedroom revisions, as each child has their own room. I have put up wall stickers, borders, more stickers, and even more borders. This is easily the worst wall border I have ever worked with... EVER! It simply does not have stick to it. We were going to go down the path of using glue, but I was too scared of what will ultimately happen to the walls, so we opted to use stick tack instead. Sure you see the small ""bubble"" from the stick tack every 18"" or so, but at least the border isn't falling down now.Be warned, this wall border does not stick at all, and you will need to come up with a solution to have it stick to the walls, even during installation."
1,"""piece of garbage"" dosen't quite do it justice.","Even garbage has some use, but this thing...Sony should recall this stinker immediately. It's currently the only stand-alone burner sold in places like Best Buy or Circuit City. It overheats (or something) after about 40 mins...this is power time, not 40 minutes of burning time. At this point it starts introducing static-hellicopter sounds over the music...utterly useless. It is marketed as a cd archiving device for transferring lp, cass, VHS, DAT...whatever. Nobody would buy this thing to just play discs, as it only reads cd and cdr and is 300 bucks retail. On it's main selling point of burning, it fails miserably. I'll get my money back, but not my time wasted on this thing. Buyer avoid!"
1,Lasted about 4 months,"I bought this for use in a church to record sermons, etc. So we didn't exactly super-stress the unit. After about 4 months (note > 90 days) it would just stop recording after about 30-35 minutes. Sometimes we could finalize what we had, sometimes not. I didn't want to believe the negative reviews I saw before purchasing - I should have. If you do get one, get an extended warranty. I got one for 2 years and they're refunding my purchase price. Sony decided it's too costly to repair."
3,Not happy with product,Unfortunately we had to ship the item back. It does not have the capability to record from analog sources. I did not have a good experience with the seller either. They made it very difficult to return the product.
1,Too Complex To Matter,"This product was represented as being very good....but with frequent statements about ""Read the Directions"". This sounded like warning enough. ""Read the Directions Over and Over"".It is much worse than that. The is no place in the directions that tell you how to record single tracks from multiple discs. The directions for finding this are actually intermingled into 3 separate places..one being...in how to PLAY from multiple discs. I have had other recording machines...so..although not the most ""tech inclined""...had enough knowledge to use and enjoy the others.This machine is terrible. Try finding the ""Program"" button....usually a first step in recording from multiple discs. This machine is just not worth the trouble. It does do a fine job in just copying an entire disc...beyond that? Garbage heap material."
5,great product,"Since I'm old-school, I was glad to get one of these Sony RCD W500C's in NEW condition even though the product has been discontinued."
4,Just as ordered,"Arrived on time, and just as ordered. What more could one ask? I already knew that I loved almost everything by Andrew Lloyd Webber"
2,"Okay, but I'd rather take the Original Broadway one","This recording is kinda cheesy. A lot of the songs use a synthesizer, and it sounds like music that a toddler would use to learn the colors or the alphabet. This version isn't all bad, though; I reeeeeely like ""Close Every Door"" and ""Who's the Thief"". They're a lot more powerful than the rest, because they've got a lot less of that toddler-ish style. The CD is not entirely bad, but I would advise you to buy another version, because this musical is way to good to be ruined by a cheesy recording of it."
3,"OK, but...","OK on basic information, could use some more examples. My main goal was using color with SCO/Linux programs. Unfortunatly this book gives no hint that color is even possible, much less how to do it. This book must be 20 years old and doesn't appear to have been updated in all that time. HAY!!! There are color terminals now!!! And Curses supports them!!! Xterms can be in color too!!!I found the doc files about ""ncurses"" that came with my ""Slackware Linux"" far more helpful than this book.The book is probably OK for intro in a classroom setting to give students background, but I can't really recommend it. You can get more ""useful"" info from a ""Yahoo"" search or from linux ""ncurses"" documentation.It can provide a quick reference for finding which curses function calls to use to do basic windowing and such."
3,A good picture -- and all I could find,"This book is the only general resource I could find on curses programming. Since everyone wants to make forms on character interfaces, the best way to do it through the standard TTY drivers is with the curses library. The examples were enough to prove to me that it's not a plug-in method, but that one needs to adapt one's application to use the curses library from top to bottom. It will be better to write my program with curses in mind from the beginning than to try to retrofit a finished product."
1,Travel Laundry Kit,"Good idea, but the suctuion cups were defective making the item worthless. We sent it back."
1,"SORRY, NO GOOD!!!","SORRY, AS I STATED ON MY OTHER REVIEWS MY GERMAN BREED, G.SHEPH. IS VERY PICKY...AND HE JUST DID NOT CARE FOR THE SMELL OF THESE BEEF ROLLS, HE DID NOT EVEN CARE TO COME CLOSE TO TAKE 2ND SNIFF....SORRY, NO STAR!!! BUT IT TRIGGERED ME TO GIVE IT AS LEAST 1 STAR TO CONTINUE MY REVIEW."
4,WHO COULD ASK FOR ANYTHING MORE?,"As avant garde as some of his fashions, the bottle designer Jean Paul Gaultier created for his signature fragrance is a stand-out. Then, with a so-who-cares bow to the accepted he presented his Mae West shaped bottle in a tin can. Women loved it, and men did, too.It brings smiles to faces when they see it on a dressing table. And, most importantly, the fragrance is delightful - a heady but not intrusive blend of roses and vanilla."
2,GOOD ENTRY LEVEL BOOK,The book is informative. Unfortunatly not much info on ballistics and effective distances. More doing with the people that are linked with the .50 BMG. Similar to an Elmer Kieth entry were the 44 Magnum is mentioned. Still a good book just not as in depth or balistic related as originally informed it would be.
4,Opinionated but entertaining,"This guy likes to run his mouth and you will not always agree with him...but I find him entertaining and informative for a person who is new to the subject.The .50 BMG rifle shooting hobby seems facinating, I definately want to get one now. If you are shooting enthusiest and want to get a look and an interesting sub-section of the shooting world, pick it up."
5,"Yes,","this is every bit as good as everyone says it is. Waits and his band slither and clank and clunk their way from a world I guarantee you've never heard from. Cynics and realists will appreciate his affirmative to the finality of death in ""Dirt In the Ground"",lovers will fool around to ""All Stripped Down"", heavy drinkers will slur along to the sly smirks of ""The Ocean Doesn't Want Me""...then get up for another beer when the delirious ""Jesus Gonna Be Here"" comes on. You aren't fully human if you hear ""A Little Rain"" without getting a bit emotional. Incredible, evcoative imagery on ""In the Colosseum""-you can actually visualize the horrific violence fest he is relating. The fact that I have left out many songs in this description says nothing about them;honestly, I just can't do them justice with my words.What a disc, what a guy."
5,Bone Machine,"If you are a Tom Waits fan, this is his best as far as I am concerned. I actually love EVERYTHING he does but you will not be dissapointed if you purchase Bone Machine. This is the true Tom Waits at his best."
4,This video is better than expected.,"If you can pretend that the actors are not high school kids and focus on the subject matter and presentation, you will find this a great video.This video handles the topic of leadership and team building using contemporary terminology. It provides strategies. The video compliments most current text books (in terms of approach).The high school actors do take away from the credibility of the instruction unfortunately."
5,Their best,"One can argue that their later CD's miss the mark, but ""Ferment"" is a stunner in every track. Watch out, these tracks will work their way into your head."
2,Ever heard of Ride?,"This album is not the pinnacle of shoegazing that a lot of people seem to think it is. This band seems to have stolen most of its ideas from the band Ride, and its album Nowhere. If you like Ferment, take one listen to Nowhere (released 2 years before, in 1990). You'll hear what I mean. Don't get me wrong, Ferment is a nice listen in places (I like ""Flower To Hide"" and ""Balloon""), but all I can think when I hear most of it is ""rip off!"".To the band's credit, they really honed their craft on later albums and concentrated on songwriting, rather than trying to take your head off with walls of guitar noise. If you compare this to their 2000 release Wishville it doesn't even sound like the same band."
4,Worth the price of admission,"Is this the most all encompassing documentary about Hendrix - No. Is it a nice look back at a rock legend and the people who know him - Yes. I enjoyed the DVD more from the historical perspective than the from the depth of information provided, but it is enjoyable none-the-less. As Belen stated in a previous review, this is a good primer for those who know little about Hendrix or those like myself, who want to have it all in the collection.The extras are nice and there is a good bit of live footage so you get the opportunity to see Jimi at work at the top of his career. This DVD is a great addition to any collection and it is inexpensive to boot!"
5,The Genuine Article,"This movie not only captures the flavor of who Jimi Hendrix was, but is a pretty accurate depiction of what the sixties was like. Jimi was probably the most brilliant rock and blues guitarist that ever lived, and anyone who wants to experience him should own this movie. As someone who was around at the time, I can testify to the authenticity of the footage and the interviews. As a true Hendrix fan, I like all the movies about him, but consider this one the best of a good lot."
5,Nice set of crimps.,"I was pleasantly surprised that these crimps worked well for the low price they were sold at. Most of the time if I replaced this tool it costs $25-30. They're durable, easy to handle and do the job just as good as the most expensive variety. Great product."
2,an old favorite but...,"This sweet book of poetry was a favorite of mine as a child and so was hoping to pass it on to other children. Unfortunately, the 'good condition' is what I would classify as poor."
3,track#3,"I'd like to know who wrote track number 3, like the writing,and where it going to,also like the vocals-not bad, for someone who wears a hat that big."
4,read it in two days,A great read. It was well written and after reading 11 of Edward Lee's book I found this one very enjoyable
4,"good group, good album","The first seven songs with the exception of ""You Know Who You Are"" are all huge hits and the reason i bought this album. It was definitely no disappointment with songs such as ""Eye of The Tiger"" and ""Search Is Over."" Everybody in my family also liked it when I played it in the car. For the first 7 songs, this album is great. The rest of the songs are good, but they don't come close to comparing to the first 7 and I didn't even know but one of them. That's the only downfall I could find with this album.After listening to Survivor, I thought they sounded a lot like Journey, but they never got quite as much hype and didn't have as many hits. They are still a great 80's group though, and I recommend this album to anyone."
3,Not Dimmu Borgir's best...,"This is one of the few occasions Old Man's Child is better then Dimmu. I love both bands and own just about every album both have produced. This album is great if you have never heard old Man's Child before, it gives you a real idea of what OMC is all about. Dimmu on the other hand gets a poor representation at best. Their tracks are just lacking, pure and simple.Buy this if you're collecting Dimmu Borgir and/or Old Man's Child albums, but other then that you're better off buying a full album from either(or both) of these great Black-Metal bands."
2,Tasty but too much sugar,"I was trying to increase my consumption of coconut products without increasing my intake of sugar.Unfortunately this pina colada mixer has ~ 22 grams of sugar (sorry I don't have itin front of me, but it was way over what I allow in a day), so I won't be buying itagain!"
3,Wide range of style,"I became really interested in Vic Dana through his version of ""I Love You Drops"" which in my mind is the very best version of that song with very rich orchestral backing. However, his most sucessful song has to be ""Red Roses for a blue lady"" which went to the top of the Pop chart. In this collection, you will encounter various styles of Vic Dana ranging from the crooners to country style. I particularly like his country style. Vic Dana in my mind did the best version of ""Wild Side of Life"" in the ""I Love You Drop"" style and backing but unfortunately this album did not include this lovely song which can only be found in his album ""Town & Country"".Some of his better efforts which I particularly like in this CD are ""Red red wine, Lying is all we need"" and ""Big and Little Sunshine"". This CD is certainly worth having."
5,works like promised,"Good, thick plastic with the same hinge as the original cover.I only wish that it came with the small slider clip that the original one uses. Sometimes they bend or wear out. But, that is not the fault of the company. they give a good description and fair price!"
3,Works but flimsy,"The vent works great so far. Easy to install. Not the prettiest vent lid and definitely not the sturdiest, but so far so good. It rained last night and it kept the rain out. Lets just see how long it hold up."
1,Horrible,"I too used Poise for several years. They have now ""imporved"" the old design. There are many complaints on the Poise site about itching, swelling, rawness and hives or rashes. This is a big change from the former product. Because I too experienced some of the above symptoms I have notified the company but have found a suitable generic brand. Some have had to see their doctor symptoms became so severe."
3,"3-star. it is not as good as it could be, I am comparing the long overnight pad only.","I am comparing the overnight & very long pad only.I will have to try all the other brands now to findwhich one comes close to being satisfactory for me.The new design is fine for ""smallest"" pad but doesnot extend to the largest. Designer lost his/her wayas the pads got larger/longer. Unfortunate.Poise Maximum Absorbency Pads, Long, 42 Count (Pack of 4)"
4,"Small Town Arkansas 1920s, 30s","Typical well drawn Douglas Jones characters populate a small northwest Arkansas town during the 1920s, 30s.. The focus is the Pay family, son and grandson of Eben Pay who was featured in other Jones' Arkansas frontier and Indian Territory novels. Father manages local railroad operations, buying ties from the hill country folks. The son, along with a trouble making ""sticks"" sidekick, rocks his neighbor's goats and steals from the merchantile. Mother has married down from a prominent big city family. Grandfather Pay's trial scenes near the book's end were the highpoints"
3,Chapter on statistics is poor,"This book presents a good overview of the theory and practice of environmental monitoring. If you intend to use it as a text, however, I would recommend using another reference for statistics. The chapter on statistics is poorly written and has numerous typos."
3,"Cute, but get something else if you have a dog","I bought this because the vacuum specialty store told me it was the best he had for dog hair on carpets.It was also adorable! Orange and purple! Nice living room sculpture!But it was very expensive, and I now know that cost is not a guarantee it is worth the money.Right now I use a Dyson I bought on sale.Yes I empty the container every 3 minutes during use, but at at least I see what it has picked up.A quick non-scientific test against Sebo Felix? Dyson wins hands down.Be prepared to replace a vacuum every other year or so if you have a long haired dog anyway.I suggest getting a bagless vacuum. WalMart has several that are a lot less costly than Dyson, and buy a replacement guaranty."
3,I Really Wanted to Like this Book,"I really wanted to like this book. After all, it was written by a woman who hiked the PCT - something I dream of doing. Most of the books about such long-distance hiking trips seem to written by men, so I was excited to find one written by a woman. I found it so hard to get through this book because of all the weepy whiny writing. If this were my first exposure to the idea of through-hiking the PCT, it would have definitely made me give up the idea! If I didn't know that hiking the PCT can be an uplifting experience, I certainly wouldn't have felt that after reading Cindy Ross' book. This book reads like a long conversation with one's therapist."
4,"""Journey on the Crest"", a journey of extraordinary endurance","I admire Cindy's extraordinary edurance and her finally fulfilling her goal although I cannot relate to her need to do such a thing. Cindy wrote of her experiences with clarity. Also, it was interesting and humorous and I enjoyed the book very much. For anyone who comtemplates doing the same thing, I heartily recommend they read her book first and for anyone not thinking of doing the same thing, I recommend it anyway just for the great entertainment, education and enjoyment of reading about a grand adventure."
4,Loved the planter...,"However, one of them did arrive with a hole punched through the side, just like a forklift might do to such an item...."
3,The Hanson of metal LITERALLY,"Amsvartner is a band that truly defy belief,These guys can play like Mother F*$&rs and they are arent even old enough to go to the pub.Its 9 tracks of thrash/black metal with some instrument work that puts even their peers to shame.Not just that Its worth buying for the killer bass opening on Funkyman."
3,Strongly recommended for book lovers,"I was sitting by my pool when my housekeeper Juanita presented me a copy of this biography of Louis Freeh, a fine and notable work of literature in the tradition of ""Farewell My Concubine"" and ""Spartacus"" by Howard Fast. In a subversive sense, I truly believed Mr. Freeh was writing the book and that he believed every word. The realism of this literature and particularly his inner dialogue, reinforcing that realism, held the book together.As if it depicts real life in the late 90s-00s, the book weaves good intentions with a subtle yet dreadful undercurrent of mania and delusion. The setting is modern-day - with meetings and public figures or something like that. But that hides the true literary intent of this work, which is to show how a man can devolve into subtle episodic periods of unhinged, jaw-twitching insanity. In coming years, this will stand strongly alongside similar works of political fiction and may even be taught in schools."
4,CAPTURES THE SPIRIT AND ENERGY OF THEIR LIVE SHOWS!,"IF YOU HAVE EVER HAD A CHANCE TO SEE JASON & THE SCORCHERS LIVE, YOU ALREADY KNOW HOW THIS CD SOUNDS. IF YOU HAVEN'T THIS WILL MAKE YOU WANT TO GO OUT AND SEE THEM NEXT TIME THEY ARE IN TOWN. THIS CD IS LIVE PERFORMANCES COMPILED OVER THE BANDS 16 YEAR CAREER. IT GOES BACK AND FORTH FROM THE ROWDINESS OF THEIR ROCK'N'ROLL TO THE SOULFULNESS OF THEIR COUNTRY MUSIC. THEY ARE TRULY A ROCK'N'ROLL BAND WITH A COUNTRY SINGER, AND IT STRENGTHENS THEM INSTEAD OF WEAKENING THEM. GUITARIST WARNER HODGES SKILLFULLY PLAYS OFF OF JASON'S LYRICS AND SINGING. IF YOU HAVE NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO PICKUP ONE OF THEIR ALBUMS BE SURE TO CATCH THEM AT THEIR BEST. LIVE AND LOUD. GO SCORCHERS!!!!!!!!!!"
3,The title song is incredible,"This is an album that clearly shows that Mr. Muñiz is a very old man doing a very admirable effort. Anyway, the title song: ""Definiciones"" is wonderful. It is poetry with music written by Raúl Rodríguez Prieto, a mexican composer that has been doing great music for quite a while. The title song itself deserves five stars and it makes this album worth listening."
4,Great resource!,"This video does a very nice job of presenting the facts and letting you decide for yourself. Great resource & tool. I especially liked the ""BITE"" acronym-Behavior control, Information control, Thought control, & Emotion control. This is more common in many denominations than you might think!!"
4,Deception Detection: Wining The Polygraph Game,"My son was acused of a sex act with his ex wife,the officer asked if he would subject to a P G test,with out thinking he said yes. So i picked up a couple of books about polygraphs & how they work,just for the mechanics on them. Scary machine,buy the book or talk to a lawyer first."
3,Just a note to the other reviewers,". . .but have those of you who call ""Frank's 2000"" TV"" an original ever heard of the TV show ""Mystery Science Theater 3000""? They're the ones who broadcast awful old movies just for the sake of wisecracking upon them. (And yes, one of the characters is named TV's Frank.) The song bears suspicious resemblance to their theme song, the 'MST3K love theme'."
3,GrooveHandle it isn't,Weird Al's level of enthusiam is only matched by his mediocrity. This is an album that you won't miss. Try some of the fresher acts such as the Juicepigs or Groovehandle.
2,Very difficult to read hands,"My wife bought me this watch as a Christmas present last year and while I like the craftsmanship, the watch face is VERY DIFFICULT to read even with excellent eyesight that I have. It's too bad because I do like it but you literally need a magnifying glass to read the hands."
3,"Good, but not great","I thought I was going to be in for a great novel, but it turned out that it was just an average book. Although I was extremely happy to see the resurrection of some of Sauls old characters (Elizabeth from Suffer the Children, Melissa and Charles Holloway from Second Child) I was disappointed with the writing. It was not as exciting as I first thought it to be. It didn't really hold me and the ending was predictable. However, as I said before, I loved the idea of Saul putting in old characters and hope that he does this again."
3,"Entertaining....But, Too Predicatble","This is the first John Saul book I have read, and I chose to read the serial thriller in its entirety rather than in pieces. I liked the developing of the history behind the Asylum while weaving the story of the town and the history it had experienced. I did not like the story being too predictable. Oliver's headaches and some of the background on him seemed to give away the story. It seemed like there was no guessing to the outcome. Overall, I enjoyed the book, but felt that the ending was weak. I think the ending could have been developed better."
3,Reads like a technical manual - what's the point?,"I wasn't very happy with this book. It reads like a technical manual. Not very intuitive and is probably useful if you are already compitent with sendmail. If you are already compitent, what's the point? Was difficult to find even the simplest details on how to do something. Impossible to read cover to cover. Like reading an encrypted phone book."
3,"Poetic, but limited","Maybe Mary Renault intended ""The Praise Singer"" to reflect the work of Simonides of Keos--compact, yet expressive and beautiful. Well, ""The Praise Singer"" is beautifully written. It is also too short. On the one hand, I'm grateful she avoided the temptation to have Simonides' fingers in every political pie in pre-democratic Athens; on the other, I wish she'd fleshed the story out more.The book is typical Renault: exquisitely drawn characters (I will never forget her Anakreon) and lyrical language that moves you along (necessary, because there's not much of a plot). But her retelling of the story of Harmodios and Aristogeiton (which feels like a random vignette, unfortunately) is flat compared to the downfall of Polykrates of Samos, which is told second-hand but still gave me chills to read. The book is no epic, and it isn't one of her best historical novels, but if you like Renault's novels on ancient Greece, you will like ""The Praise Singer,"" faults and all."
2,don't pay more than $20,"The book is fine... informative... I like it... but I feel incredibly price gouged!! Amazon listed it new for sale at over $200, so I thought that the $50 used one I found must be a good deal. The list price on the back cover is $12.95!! It is a TINY book... and it only covers a portion of available essential oils regarding their fragrance properties. For the price I paid I thought for sure it would be more comprehensive.Overall it is a good buy if you do not spend more than $20 on it."
5,The Next Few Hits...,"...Greatest Hits Vol 1 had all of the most popular songs that Elton ever sang. This is Vol 2 and it goes a bit deeper into his vast musical history. Some songs may not be known by anyone who is a casual listener. Whether you know these songs or not, this is an excellent disc. You gotta hear Elton's fast paced cover of The Beatles' ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds"". Other highlights are ""Levon"" and ""Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word"". If you got Vol 1, don't stop now!"
3,1-Size-Fits-All Classroom,"I enjoy the succinct review of the issues one must deal with as a science teacher. Each chapter left me thinking, ""I'm sure that there's something more useful that a few lesson ideas and hit-or-miss advice on what works in the classroom.""I encourage the clueless beginner to use this book as a reference, but not to rely on it for all the tricks that only you will adopt and adapt once you get a few more years under your belt. Example- I've found that using interactive notebooks makes grading less complicated for the assessment of groups and individuals, too. I'll add ""Help!..."" to my library, use the links, and continue to hone my skills academically and in the classroom."
4,Shame on you Amazon.com!!!!!,"I liked Angel. Lots of people liked Angel. Yes they were ridiculas looking and they had a guitarist named ""Punky"" but I liked Angel. Why would Amazon.com put a poor review of the band on a page where, I assume, they are trying to sell records? If you liked Angel you will like this compolation. It has an unrealesed version of ""walk Away Renay"" that is worth the price alone. Saddly none of the live stuff from ""Live without a net"" is present and my personal favorite ""On the Rocks"" is absent as well. Still this is a fine collection from a band who deserves better then to be disrespected by the online company who is carrying there stuff. Shame on you Amazon.com.""Lost Johnny"""
2,Gene Simmons thingy,"I purchased this used a few years back because I was always interested in the band though I had never heard them, I had heard ABOUT them , but never heard their music. It was a complete letdown. It sounds mostly like Kiss reject songs. It does have a nice 1970s production valkue to it, but the songs do not, I repeat, do not deliver. If this was the band's best of then I have to say the band was a complete waste of time. ""White Lightening"" is the only thing that resembles a good rock song, it has a good solid riff and chugs along quiet nicely, but the best song on the whole two discs is the re-working of ""Walk Away Renee"". If you liked this band when you were 10, then you are forgiven for having a soft spot for the group, for everyone else, however, skip this tripe."
2,Not Creditable,"When it comes to spirit communication, I tend to be more of a believer than a sceptic but this book does not seem creditable to me. For some reason, Princess Diana, Al Capone, Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe and Elvis just happened to drop in for a chat. The author really lost me when he said that Princess Diana told him that she and Mother Teresa wanted to start a hospital on the other side! I can't say for sure if Mr. Solomon is a genuine medium or not and my respect for Dr. Holzer, who wrote the introduction, keeps me from dismissing this book completly but I can't recommend it either."
5,Pure energy and soul,"I live in Austin and have seen Mingo live many, many times. They are simply incredible live....soooooooo much energy and soul and musicianship. Their first cd did a poor job of capturing the essence of Mingo but this cd is leaps and bounds above the first effort and is as close to hearing them live as you're going to get.If you like this cd you MUST go see them live - they put on an excellent show. If you like their first cd or have seen them live, then purchase this cd. If you don't know who the hell Mingo Fishtrap is, prepare for some down and dirty funky soul music."
2,Jodster,"I wish I had taken Bobbbb's review to heart before I bought this album. I agree wholeheartedly that, while this isn't bad, and may be something different to those unacustomed to a capella groups, it is NOT the innovative sounds of the Nylons when they were the original group. I'm a big fan of their early work, but anything from the 90's on just is not the Nylons. I was very disappointed in this album, and I'll be playing my ""Rockapella Christmas"" album by the group Rockapella over and over again instead of this one. Rockapella has the spark and the fun that the Nylons used to have, in spades."
3,"OK, but the other Witzy books are better","This book's illustrations are more basic. The drawings have a white background, but not a big deal. However, there are no words to read to the baby! There is one word spelled out in the blocks of the drawings ""Music"", ""Yummy"", ""Follow Me"", ""Goodnight"", but that's it. It gets an additional star because my baby likes looking at this book, but I have nothing to read to her, except to describe whats going on in the picture."
5,Born In Death,"Eve and Roarke fans will love this selection!!!! The last chapter had me holding my ribs in laughter! As usual Eve works to exhaustion. Although the mysteries, I agree with other posts, were transparent, it will not disappoint diehard fans!!! This series continues to surprise me that it still has so much life left in it! Bravo JD Robb!"
4,"While good, not her best","Eve Dallas has a lot on her plate right now, a couple that dead, a missing mom-to-be and her best friend is about to give birth. While it seems that her two cases are not related, they are. Now Eve, Roarke, and and her faithful crew are under the gun to solve these crimes.""Born in Death"" is the lastest book by J.D. Robb, while the Mavis giving birth is funny, overall this book is lacking the grit of past books."
5,The Lives of the Kings and Queens of England,"Very good. The presentation does not read the books in order. The set has several authors. Instead, the readings are chronoligical and are very easy to follow."
1,$5.95 worth of nothing,"I bought this to copy and give to our spelling bee winner for our school, and all I received was a partial sentence. There is nothing else available. There may have been an interview and an article, however, it is not on here. Do not waste the money on this."
4,"Welcome to the world, Monotone Pictures","This was passed on to me by a friend and my ears have been greatful ever since. There is a future for this band--it begins with this album. Favorite tracks: ""String"", ""Avoiding Summer"", and ""Slip Away"", but with each listen, another favorite is added to the list. There is evidence that this band has room to grow (""Candles""), but overall, this CD does far from disappoint. I highly recommend this buy and I'm looking forward to more...."
5,"accessible, lyrical, smart - among my faves","While it is lyrical, and lovely in its prose and thought provoking and thoughtful in its content, this book is also light, charming and completely accessible to anyone with a reasonably sound 8th grade education."
2,For insomniacs only,"Can't sleep? Call Dr. Feldman! His medicine (in painless, easy-to-take CD form) will banish your anxieties and allow you to get the rest you need. It's more effective than counting sheep, and unlike sleeping pills, won't make you groggy all the time."
4,4 disc,"hey, want to know EVERYTHING about thisPermanent Record: Al In The Box is a four disc compilation boxed set of songs by ""Weird Al"" Yankovic. It features his favorites songs from his first eight studio albums, plus alternate versions of ""My Bologna"", ""Happy Birthday"", ""UHF"", and the previously unavailable new single, ""Headline News"". The Andy Warhol-esque cover art and ""Headline News"" also appear on Yankovic's Greatest Hits Volume II, which was released a month after Permanent Record.The boxed set also comes with a booklet written by Dr. DementoPermanent Record went out of print on March 1, 2006, because the artwork was lost."
5,laughable but fun,"I don't know what it is about Leif Garrett, but there's something about this particular pretty boy that just makes me want to...well, listen to his ""music."" (I use that word loosely.) He is hot stuff and I put this CD on when no one's home and lip synch in front of the mirror in my spandex, Leif-style. I'm a teen of the 90's, and I wish there were more heartthrobs like Leif instead of those greasy Backstreet Boys."
4,WHEN I THINK OF LEIF!,"wow - a leif garrett collection in one cd. i was only 12 when leif entered the scene. he was the favorite cover of then emerging teen magazine ""teen beat."" his first single here in our country was ""surfin' usa"" which was a ctually a remake of the beach boys' hit.as he grew older and years passed, fans saw that he coudl actually generate a hit after a hit...and so on...my fave tracks here include ""memorize your number"" ""when i think of you"" ""surfin usa"" ""runaround sue"" and ""i was looking for someone to love."" this cd sounds great as the tracks were all remastered. it seems just like yesterday when leif was so popular and not nearly 30 years ago...in an era where only few dared, leif was at the forefront of pop music, and this compilation summarizes the greatness of his short singing career."
5,Great Pictures,Good book.It has a sweet storyThis book has beautiful picturesWould recommend this book for any young horse lover
5,Best black metal...HANDS DOWN!,"Once again I'm speechless! This beats Emperor, Marduk, etc. (Although they are great...don't get me wrong) Every metal fan should buy as much Enthroned as they can get their hands on!"
4,apocalypse now,"I am a big fan of modernday black metal and this is one of the most important torch-bearer in this genre. The music is as intense as it gets. Although I consider their sound a tad to light (more bass, please) they certainly make this up in speed and aggressiveness. In the near future I will definitely try out their other cd's. It surprised me to read that the members of this wonderful band are from Belgium. All hail and raise your banners for the apocalypse manifesto!!!"
4,"Great pop, endlessly interesting","This album showcases the widely varying styles that have kept EJ in the public eye for three decades. These are a smattering of recordings from his finest, when he and Bernie explored together the pop possibilities of lead piano coupled with lead guitar.Elton's voice is not overbearing. He lets the words speak themselves on most songs, which is appropriate with lyrics this poetic.A great buy, but better is ""Yellow Brick Road"". Strangely enough, that album is the masterpiece from Elton in the 70's, not this.Pray.Out."
5,Greatest Hits by Elton John...and I agree!,"Every song puts you in a good mood. If you want to buy an Elton John album, this should be the one!"
1,MP3 Downloads are MONO!!!,"Buyer beware... the MP3 downloads may be technically stereo tracks, but the sound is totally mono. Just listen to the samples... the actual downloads are the same."
4,Pretty good but not his best,"I first read this when I was on my Koontz kick. (My Koontz kick started with Strangers, then progressed to Watchers and Lightning. Midnight was the 4th book I read of his, and I was a little disappointed with it as compared to the others. The other three did a much better job integrating horror and science fiction. In Midnight, the horror elements almost seemed like caricatures (loony/megalomaniacal scientist, nasty shapeshifting creatures, etc.). Still, the suspense was there (the scene with Chrissy in the closet was quite well done. And the dog, as always, was great!"
4,I liked this book..scary and fun,"I have read this book twice, about 10 yrs. apart and enjoyed it both times. I think it was scarier in audiobook version, something about hearing the changes described verbally rather than reading the words.If you are looking for something that is really fantasy based then you will like this, although some of the descriptions are fairly gory. If you are looking for some realism, this is not for you.To those who couldn't get past incorrect police procedures and very smart pets, relax a little and get lost in the fantasy. This is pure escapism!!"
2,Living on borrowed ideas,"This here's a retread of several other classic books, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Island of Doctor Moreau, and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. I really loved Koontz' Odd Thomas and Forever Odd, and decided to explore his other novels, and found here, quite a stinker. The old adage of if you're going to do a remake, it had better be better than the original is a good standard to uphold, but the author does not apply it here. Although this novel is mildly diverting - why waste time on a weak remake? Also, I got to say the authors photo on the backs of most of his paperbacks is a rather annoying, self indulgent feature. I'd much rather see some information about the book itself."
3,Unknown,"This is the story of a group of men who wake up in a locked warehouse with no memory of what happened. Their only clue is a strange phone call at the beginning of the story. Filled with suspense as they slowly and painfully begin to unwind the truth of what happened, the viewer is left guessing all the way to the end. Featuring a talented ensemble cast of young, seasoned performers, featuring Jim Caviezel, Barry Pepper, Greg Kinnear, and Jake Gyllenhaal, you will on the edge of your seat trying to figure it out with them. Some scenes may be too intense for very young viewers. Also filled with profanity."
5,The BEST ZOMBIE MOVIE EVER!!,"I realize that I will be in the minority on this, but this remake is FAR FAR better than the crap that Romero did. His original was painfully horrible. This version ix beautifully designed. Actors were perfectin this. I have this in my movie collection."
1,28 days in the USA instead of the UK,"Dawn of the Dead uses the same type of fast moving, infectious, pack animal, zombies from 28 Days Later. This time the story doesn't attempt to convey any message at all and the actors have a California accent instead of a British accent. It has the fast intro followed by the slow, ocassionally interrupted, waiting scenes and then the ending. If you have seen 28 days later, then this movie is a waste of time. That is unless you wanted an extra couple hours of those slow, ocassionally interrupted, waiting scenes. If you go, stay seated when the movie ends! There were extra scenes in the credits and those bored people who were trying to leave the theatre were blocking my view!!!"
2,Dawn of the Duds!,"If your going to watch this movie, I Prefer that you rent it before you buy it. Some Good zombie effects, but the plot lacks as it builds up to the end. All in all a real dumb ending, the credits roll, with quick cuts as to what happens to the rest of the cast. Better off watching the original!"
5,Love it!!,"Scary zombies eating people is always fun to watch late in the evening on the 70"" screen. If you've got a great theator system to go with it then this movie is for you, but make sure you turn the volume up loud so you can experience the thrill!Forget the negative reviews! Buy this movie! It is scary, funny, and exciting all wrapped into one! Who cares about comparing it to the original? This is simply a great zombie movie!"
1,Zack Sydner's Awful and Pointless Remake,"I groaned aloud many times sitting through this awful ""remake"". They could have at least updated the movie with new technology but no, the way the script was written, it could have been filmed in 1978. I was glad to hear that Ving Rhames was in this movie, until I watched it for myself. Suprisingly, Ving is downright DULL in this movie. The marathon racing zombies were terrible, they aren't even used to good effect. This movie is neither funny nor scary, and never decides which. The original was both. There are TOOOOOOOOOOOO MANY CHARACTERS that we never get a chance to get to know the ones that first enter the mall. the mall was not used for ANYTHING other than just being something stolen from the original. There could have been lots that the director could have made fun of to update the movie: video games, cell phones, the internet, rap music. (...)"
4,Zombie movie insanity,"This has to be a first in the zombie remake history,this film kicks so much ... its unreal,from the word go all hell has broken loose and the zombie threat is relentless. What appeals to me is that the use of CGI isnt too much,it all looks pretty realistic,and vile. There are not so many shock moments but there is plenty of tension to be had through out. There are a few cringe worthy bits in here too,but the original one had these also.For gore fans and horror buffs this is a great film,for those who want to see how it shapes up this film is awesome."
3,"GOOD, BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH","I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A FAN OF ZOMBIE MOVIES ESPECIALLY ALL OF THE NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEADS. SO AFTER CATCHING THE FIRST ""PREVIEW' 10 MINUTES OF THIS ON USA, I LOOKED FORWARD TO THIS WITH ANTICIPATION. THE MOVIE IS FAST PACED, ALMOST TOO FAST TO FOCUS ON AT TIMES, WHAT IS HAPPENING. SINCE WHEN CAN ZOMBIES MOVE THAT FAST? SOME SCENES COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER PLOTTED. THEATER GOERS WERE LAUGHING MORE THAN SCARED.THIS MOVIE IS A MIX OF HUMOR AND BLOOD SPURTS."
4,I was pleasantly surprised........,"on how good this movie was.horror movies have SUCKED over the past several years. in a world of crappy flicks like ""scream"" and ""i know what you did last summer"" and ""the grudge"", its nice to see a real balls out gory horror movie, that isnt geared towards 13 year old girls.i saw the remake of ""texas chainsaw massacre"" and thought it was crap, it wasnt scary or gory and when this came out i figured ""here we go again"" and when i hear ving raimes and makah pfieier, or however you spell them, was in it i was like ""god, this movies gonna be lame"" but when i rented it last night and saw it.......i was surprised on how gory and creepy it was.not bad...i give it a 8 out of 10"
5,A fun movie,"Apart from the fact that the survivors of the zombie outbreak congregate in a mall, this film is an almost completely different story than the 1978 original by George Romero. This is not an art-house film, it is clearly written for mass consumption. Romero's Dawn of the Dead meets The A-Team. That said, the film has a lot of scares and a lot of action. I enjoyed it more than the first Resident Evil Movie, and more than the remake of Night of the Living Dead. I enjoyed it about the same as Resident Evil: Apocalypse and Aliens."
1,Review of the trailer...,"...Since that's all that's out yet. Remaking George Romero? The trailer showed much better production values than the original (not necessarily a good thing - style cannot replace substance) and revealed an alarming plot change: zombies doing ""wire-fu"" jumps. I paid my 8.50, I saw the Matrix, I don't want to see zombies move faster in death than they did in life. This film looks like it will follow the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" remake path - straight to discount video heck. How much did they have to pay Ving Rhames to be in this? I may just see it on the off chance he saw something in it worth putting on film. Gotta give points for the ""population:"" sign gag in the trailer, though - cleverer than most trailers."
4,blast from the past!!!!!!!,"THIS FILM IS THE BEST REMAKE OF RECENT HISTORY. A FILM THAT GEORGE A ROMERO SHOULD BE PROUD. THE SET UP OF THE FILM IS QUICK AND FAST PACED. IT'S A FILM THAT GETS TO THE POINT AND DOESN'T MAKE YOU WAIT FOR THE ACTION. SIMPLE FORMAT BUT IT WORKS GREAT! ANY DIRECTOR WHO IS SHOOTING A REMADE, SHOULD SIT DOWN AND WATCH THIS FILM!!!!!!!!!!!!ACES!!!!!!!"
5,One of the best zombie movies,"This movie is one of the better zombie movies out there. It really set the stage for the ""fast zombie"" movie genre. These zombies are not the typical walkers you see on TV!This movie is scary, suprising, and funny at times."
5,"AS GOOD AS THE FIRST! BUT BETTER,? NO!","I HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS WAS A GREAT REMAKE OF THE CLASSIC ""DAWN OF THE DEAD"" BY GEORGE ROMARO. BUT IT IS NOT BETTER THAN THE FIRST, ITS AS GOOD BUT NOT BETTER. THEY ARE BOTH DIFFERENT MOVIES. THIS IS WAY BETTER GORE AND I LOVED EVERY HEAD EXPLODING, BRAIN OOZING, NECK BITING BIT OF IT. IT WAS WELL PACED AND ON FIRE! SEE IT AND YOU WILL LOVE IT! I KNOW THERE'S HARDCORE GEORGE ROMARO FANS OUT THERE THAT WONT GIVE THIS A CHANCE, BUT GUESS WHAT? GOERGE IS LITERELY DEAD, AND ITS TIME FOR A NEW HORROR KING TO RISE!"
3,Don't watch the bonus features,"If you liked the movie, like me, don't watch the bonus features. It's like watching an unfunny skit on Saturday Night Live. One is a video diary of the guy across the street who communicates with the people in the mall. This thing is so long...and so boring...and so poorly acted...I wish I never even bothered to watch it all. And then there's a mock news broadcast that is just as long and just as poorly acted. And the whole thing just looks cheap. The sets are cheap, the scripts are cheap, the actors are cheap. In one of the news broadcasts, a zombie, strapped down to a table in a hospital, manages to eat a doctor. How? I don't know.As for the actual movie. I enjoyed it. It was a bit cheesy and stupid but it was good. Not as good as 28 Days Later...but good. Worth a rental."
3,"""Tell him to shoot burt reynolds.""","A very lame attempt to reguvinate the franchise that is the dead series. Sure, it has style. But the gore gets reptative, the characters are two dimensional and the plot . . .well, actually there's not too bad on plot. this one ends differently than the original. Way different. On a sharp note you might say. But I would have liked it much more if they used more items in the mall. All they ever did was hang out in the cafe area. Totally lame, man. All that free stuff and you're not going to use it?"
4,Decent remake of the original,"I thought this was a decent remake of the original Dawn Of The Dead but if you haven't seen the original 1978 movie then you need to go back and watch it right away. And if you're a huge fan like me, you need to buy the Ultimate Edition four-disc set that Anchor Bay just released. It has the U.S. Theatrical Version, the Extended Version, the European Version and tons of documentaries and extras! Don't wait, don't hesitate, buy it today!"
2,MTV version,"Mediocre just like the rest of the modern day MTV style ""horror"" movies. A boring movie that lacks any kind of feel and very little gore here folks.Running zombies? Sorry but rigor mortis wouldn't allow that."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGNAL!,"First I would like to say I love the old zombie movies, and I'm a huge horror fan! I love ROMERO'S zombie films!!!!! But this just did nothing for me. Sure the gore was there, a little weak but there. And I could not get into this movie because every person was a total bastard!!! even the good guys in the movie sucked! And what's with the lame 28 days later hyper zombies??!! I keep asking myself "" how can you remake some of the greatest horror movies ever??"" go geT SHAUN OF THE DEAD!!!!!!!!! now that's a cool zombie movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Good B movie,"This movie is a great B movie. Has a few ""shocking"" moments but over all its a good movie. Love it!"
3,A tad bit cheesy.....,"I thought this movie was going to be wicked scary, while it does have a few shocker moments when you jump the rest of the movie is rather cheesy and silly. If you want to have a good laugh go on and see it. I would recommend waiting till dvd realease and renting it."
4,good remake...BUT WHATS WITH THE ENDING!!!,"I dont understand what the commotion is about the DAWN OF THE DEAD REMAKE ending. FIRST OFF iM not gonna spoil it cause....THERES NOTHING TO SPOIL IT ABOUT!AND IF YOU FEEL like Youre being spoiled dont read this.HOW THE HELL is this such a ""unique"" ending.ALL YOU SEE IS VING RHAMES SHOOT HORES OF ZOMBIES AND YOU DONT SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO THE OTHER CHARACTERS. All you see is the ving rhames shooting LOTS AND LOTS of zombies and then more keep coming. MORE MORE MORE until This camera that was taping ving shooting the zombies drops or brakes, something like that and its in the middle of the credits. Than zombies keeping coming up to the cam qaurter and going back to credits. Credits, zombies in the screen, credits, You get the picture. SO if you people thought this was even an ending your absolutley wrong!The original had an ending. Acctually 2 endings. One was taken out. Thats all I had to say"
2,TOO BAD FOR ME,I really wanted to like this film but it didn't hold my interest past the first 15 minutes. I guess I'm just not the zombie fan that I thought I was and playing Left 4 Dead on Steam doesn't count. MY GRADE: D plus to C minus; WHEN WATCHED: 02/22/2011.
4,No me and my wine,I'd give five stars and then some but two songs are missing. The other version of bringing on the heartbreak and Me and wine. Why are the two songs off?
1,Bland vanilla beats,"I saw these guys live once, and they seemed more interested in striking poses than they did in creating memorable music. Tailor made for some Sassy cute band alert or something, The Push Kings are masters at image-maintenance (even if they haven't gotten big). With hip haircuts, carefully-selected vintage wear, and not an ounce of real talent, they strut their stuff like they're taking lessons from Liam Gallagher. FAR PLACES is just the latest insult in their catalogue. It sounds like they're taking lessons from Hanson this time out (whereas on their first album, they were ripping off the Beatles). There's simply nothing here. Vanilla beats everywhere, and mmmmmbopping vocals, but it's a confectionary with an arsenic coating. Steer clear."
1,Came apart - 2 times!,"I've used Quickie's sponge mops for years, always using the head until it wore out completely. I recently had to buy an entire new mop after the pole rusted out - hey, it was old. After a couple of months of light use, the sponge separated from the plastic backing. Quickie replaced the head. Happened again. Once is an accident - twice is a bad habit. I'm off to buy a different brand - metal, American made."
2,Should have released Retro Active instead,Def Leppard should have released the rariteis album Retro Active and used these filler songs for the b sides. This album is weak. The only reason i give it two stars is for the only two songs on the disk that are not filler. Those songs would be 'White Lightning' and 'Tear It Down'. This album did well but it was just a poor attempt to recreate 'Hysteria'. Pick up Retro Active instead.
2,Missing quite a few b-sides.,"I have always loved this album. BUT the bonus disc is missing ""Action"", ""From The Inside"", ""Miss You In a Heartbeat"", ""Only After Dark"", and ""She's Too Tough"". I know they were previously released on Retroactive, however it would have been nice to include them here to be complete. Still hoping for a REAL b-sides comp."
2,yuck,"If there's any fan of DefLep from the ""High and Dry"" and ""Pyromania"" who likes this album, please step forward and seek medical attention. I suppose if you came to DefLep at ""Hysteria"" you might think this is more along those lines, and a good album -- but even then, I don't see it ... since Hysteria was still actually pretty solid, and this is, for the most part, purely awful, Michael Bolton material. Let's Got Rocked is a pretty good tune, and it goes downhill from there.The ballads that are in here helped DefLep stay on the charts, but compare in no way to ""Bringing on the Heartbreak"" or even the likes of the song ""Hysteria"" itself. They are embarassing.DefLep came back to redeem themselves with some real cool tracks on later albums - which I wasn't sure was possible. But this is the only DefLep album I do not own."
2,Beginning of the end for Def Lepp,"I remember full well when this CD came in 92 the year of grunge of course it went in at #1 in the charts everywhere. With a handful of tunes written/co-written by the great late Steve ""steamin"" Clark I thought this'll be all right well I was wrong for the most part sugary sweet sappy ballads (well this is the same DL we've had ever since this album). These guys no longer rock I really tried to like the 99 release Euphoria but alas Viv is really no replacement for Steve. You'd think given Vivien Cambell's past Def Leppard would ROCK AND ROLL. I know that Phil Collen was playing all the guitar parts by himself on this album the band should have gotten a tempory replacement in the studio at least (to play Steve's parts). Well at least their are 4 master pieces of work from these guys prior to Adrenalize."
3,A good novelty album for fans of the show,"Pretty good, though Catherine Bach (Daisy) is painful to listen to. The General Lee songs are good; I didn't enjoy listening to the big car race sequence, ""Duelin' Dukes"", which I felt should be left to the show. ""Laughing All The Way To The Bank"", song by Sorrell Brooke (Boss) and ""Flash(TM)""(Rosco) are excellent. CD has a special bonus track not available on original LP. I liked The Band's version of ""Up on Cripple Creek"" better than Tom Wopat's. All said, if you liked the show, this is an item worth owning."
1,A Disappointing Book,"The self-important author favors generalizations, over-inflated ideas, and wrong terminology. The book is an quasi-academic treatise in which obvious concepts are discussed in depth by a writer of limited professional knowledge. I returned my copy. Spend your book-buying dollars on another title."
4,"One of my favorite holiday albums, but overpriced now...","I bought everything by the Trio starting in 1959, when I was 15 and discovered folk-style singing. This was a record I played to death every December for 10 or 15 years, until it wore out. I have not purchased the CD because as much as I love the 30-minute program, it is not worth a dollar a song. Perhaps it is a case of my being more interested in bargains than in nostalgia. Some other reviewers are correct in that the tunes are mostly done for quiet beauty rather than for joyful spirit, but still, they are sung well. I still want this, but for about half of what the current market seems to bear. If you can afford it and you like folk-flavored Yule songs, this is a winner, with a couple of songs you probably won't find anywhere else, ever."
2,Well-esteemed by closed and less-informed minds,"this is a widely praised novel and even became a movie. It is basically propaganda but as propaganda it is quite good, hence the popularity for a book involving an incident whose real-life Jewish survivors have said the novel was false (the Exodus ship). Still, it tells people what they want to hear and so it gets rave reviews. Actually, few notice the anti-Arab racism, the distorted history, and the button-pushing manipulation behind the well-crafted characters and events. The despoiling of the Palestinians is skirted and justified. This should be read to uinderstand how pro-Israeli opinion is manufactured and nurtured in popular opinion rather than as an accurate novelization of history. One day Uris will go down with Steicher, Goebbels, D.W. Griffith, and otehrs as a succesful purveyor of racist political art."
3,School assignment for an 11 year old,Our 11 year old daughter was given a choice of books to read for spring break by her school. (Not public)Exodus was one of the choices. We looked at all choices and did research on Amazon.com. Exodus sounded like the best choice based upon the jacket quotes and statements on amazon.com. Our Daughter has been very dark and brooding recently and we finally ferreted out that it was because of reading about the torture graphically described in the book. Not cool for OUR 11 year old. You make the call at your house. FYI
5,An amazing read,"Although a bit slow at the beginning, Exodus was an incredibly compelling book. Anyone who would like to learn more about the history of the Exodus back to Israel or of the Arab/Israeli conflict should read this book. It is a story of fiercely determined people who will give up their lives, both physically and emotionally, to Israel. It was a book that requires ""recovery"" once it is finished. It gave me a greater understanding of why the Jews are the way they are. It's definitely not a ""feel-good"" book, it's a dose of reality. It is worth a read or two."
4,"over all, a good book","This a captivating story, masterfully written, and on the most part, well researched.I read this book already knowing the story of Israel, and as such i can say that the things Uris describes in his books are true. It may be slightly biased against Arabs, however he does present good Arab people too. And if someone says that the great zeal of the Jewish people for the land of Israel is absurd, i would have to disagree. As a Jew and an Israeli i can say that Jews do indeed feel the kind of Zeal for Israel as is described in Exodus, at the end of every year Jews sing the traditional song which consists of the words, ""Next year in Jerusalem"", thus i cannot agree with people who say that it is biased and it's ideas are false."
4,Never Again,"It never hurts to review and remember our own heritage. I have been faithful to tell my children of WW11 and the Holocaust. I support the Holocaust Museum and give regularly to Anti-Semitic societies. It is all too easy to think that mankind has evolved beyond this type of behavior and beliefs. However, news events everyday should remind all of us that unreasonable reactions of suspicion and hatred based on ignorance or propaganda can slowly undermine everything we ""think"" we've overcome.To read of the hardships Israel went through to realize the dream of becoming once again a nation, should prick all our consciences.""Never Again"" is meaningless if this generation knows nothing of the events to begin with. This is a beloved book. I recommend it to everyone with preconceived notions of history versus ""Today's Headlines."" In fact, I honestly believe it should be required reading in high school."
3,"A good read, but over-simplified view of the subject","I first read this book as a freshman in high school and was enthralled by the story--it formed the basis of my opinion on the Middle East conflict for the next several years. Of course, as I learned more about the issues on both sides, I quickly learned how much more complicated the issues were for all sides. The book is entertaining and engaging, but you need to read it with a full understanding of where Uris' sympathies lie, and how this influences the story he tells."
3,My mistake.,"I ordered this because I'm a purple freak. I also got so carried away by the picture, I didn't read the description closely enough. I was on an elongated seat search, and, looking at the picture, thought this was one. It isn't. It looks very little like the picture. It is regular, and the color is much more toward blue. Of course, a corn flower IS blue, but purple was part of the description, and ...I was really just totally in love with the picture. The lower rating is mostly because there was a noticeable flaw on the top of the lid. I don't consider it to be the companies fault that I wasn't more careful to check the size, but I do think they should have had the right picture. I had this seat and another one, from a different company, in my wish list. The pictures were identical, and the other one WAS labeled elongated and NOT labeled corn flower. Unfortunately, I picked the wrong one...and adding to my mistake, I picked the more expensive one, thinking it would be a better product."
3,Run-on Sentences,"This book is informative and the author is obviously intelligent. The reading is hard to follow, however. The author makes a great use of run-on sentences. He is constantly interjecting side thoughts within a sentence that makes the use of many commas with some dashes the norm. Sentences greater than an inch in width down a page are quite common. One must reread continuously to try to connect his thoughts. Except toward the end, this is not a light reading book."
2,"A comprehensive introduction to ""addicting"" as an adjective","I found this text to be alarmist/naive at worst and dry/laughable at best. The author writes very little for himself and the style of citation used is completely disruptive. It is not the worst book I have ever slogged through, but it fell far below my standards for reference literature; I require at least the impression that the writer has mastered the grammar relevant to his subject."
3,Very few phone pranks!,"I've really gotten a kick out of Richardson's phone pranks. I bought this CD thinking I was getting just that. As it turns out, there are only 4 pranks (right at the beginning). The rest is pretty much just him on stage telling jokes. He inserts some of his ""family members'"" names in the jokes. Overall, it was okay. Just not at all what I expected."
3,Mistaken Identity,"If you're looking for the MTV version of this song, this is the wrong CD to buy. If you like dance mixes, you'll get your money's worth."
4,Help for the Job Needy,"As educators know, it can be difficult to put together a resume filled with all that goes into teaching: classroom, coaching, club advisor, education, licenses, etc. This book not only tells the career educator what to include, it helps weed out unnecessary information. With sections such as Production Guidelines, Tailoring Your Resume, and Resumes for International Teaching, this book is for the teacher seriously looking for a new position. It even has a section on Cover Letters."
1,these treats make dogs sick,"I gave these treats to my chihuahua mix and he developed renal failure. I then found out the FDA had issued a warning about these treats causing renal failure. I'm amazed Amazon is still selling them. My dog just spent 2 days getting IV fluids at the vets and may still not survive. Yes, he absolutely loved these treats. But please, at the very least, read about the warnings and what's happened to other animals before thinking about giving them to your pet."
4,Good afro-beat grooves,"If you're into Antibalas or any other afro-beat orchestras you know what you're getting. Prominent barri sax parts with awesome rhythms and brass parts. Not pushing any new boundaries here, but definitely solid for what it is."
2,Go with a defferent recorder.,"I also had problems with converting file formats. Don't buy if you are planning to burn recordings onto CDs. Also, apparently the headphone jack is designed to only work with one headphone instead of both. Kind of annoying. And the quality of the recordings in NOT very good at all. Perhaps due to comparison (Sony IC Recorder ICD-PX720 - MUCH better product for about the same price). True, this Olympus recorder is one of the only ""cheaper"" digital recorders I could find that works with Windows 7, but hopefully that will be resolved soon enough. Oh, and be careful about ordering through BuyAccessories. If you have a return problem, they are not very easy to work with."
2,Came in with High Expectations.,"Maybe I came in with to high of expectations? I don't know, but I did not find this movie enjoyable at all. Some people might say that I didn't get all of the hidden meanings and innuendoes. I did pick up on everything and still found myself thinking 'So what, get on with the movie already!'.With a great cast of actors and people telling me how great this movie was, I think I just came in expecting to much. I was very disappointed..."
3,It was ok,I saw this film yesterday on Encore and I will say this was a pretty decent film and Edward Norton showed a great Performance as a Drug Dealer who should have stopped along time ago(doing what he does I mean..duhh)and now spends his last day with his family and Friends before he must serve a Prison Trial.I thought the movie was pretty decent I mean it's nothing new here. Not Spike Lee's best but still worth a watch or rent.3 out of 5
1,Worst $5.00 I have ever spent,"Movie jumps from scene to scene. Don't know whether you are watching the past, present. Boring. Don't waste your money renting this one."
2,Fans can never be objective...,"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...Elton live is rarely good and expanding this to include the full London and New York concerts doesn't mean more is better, it's just more."
2,Rocky Fossil,"This CD of an ancient video is a fossil from the early days of primitive television in America. Production values were low. The series was originally shot live so all the scenes are genuinely sequential. Yet there is little evidence of the dramatic tension that supposedly accompanied live broadcasts of such ""classic television"" as Marty. Roscoe Karns as the eponymous Detective King obviously has a little trouble from time to time with his lines as written and instead paraphrases. The plots are as simple as you would expect give the restraints on numbers of characters and impossibility of exterior scenes. The series uses the even then hokey device of having King speak on the phone in every episode to his never-seen wife whose voice is nevertheless heard. There is novelty value here but not much else."
3,Ok movie,I bought this movie because Mya was in it. She played the part of a very passive girlfriend and it was not a good part or something that I really wanted to see. No backbone. The roles of the other actors are very flip and I would not buy it again if I had to do it all over again. It's the kind of movie that you could go outside and talk to your neighbor while it was playing and them come back in and see basically the same stuff happening to the people in the movie dating each other. It is not so much predictable but just plain closer to boring.
3,Average bootlet quality only...,"Here's another one...another audience recording of John Wetton live. It is a very good sounding audience recording, but certainly not worth the money...Did Wetton not record any of his concerts that he has to officially release so-so (this one) and awful (Live in New York, for example) audience recordings? I understand trying to boot the bootleggers but I have better-sounding concert recordings of Wetton I've traded for and been freely given.Honestly, John, if you're looking for soundboard quality live recordings, give me a call...I have better sounding shows than this one that you haven't released."
2,Patio Fan,"Although well made, and competitively priced, the unit was a disapointment because the fan does not ocilate, and so the mist concentrates in one area causing wetness. I returned it to get another model that does ocilate."
2,Not very useful,"I purchased this textbook as required reading for a grad class, and barely used it. It's a short, thin book, seems to be lacking in key topics, and the index is minimally useful. If I had it to do over, I'd purchase a more rigorous soil chem textbook."
2,It's.....really not that great........,"I tried to give this book a chance. I really did. I tired to read over three separate times, but just couldn't read it. The writing is wired, with several typos. Some parts are ok, but it seems rushed and sloppy. Also, some of the sentences didn't make sense, and I had to re-read it many times to get it. I am also one of toughs book hoarders who, if it's not pilled into their bookshelf, then I put it in a box, not throw them away. I ended up tossing it. I just couldn't get into it."
3,Persisting odd flaws in a textbook,"I am using the 44th printing (2007) of the 1999 textbook's first edition.The book is published by The Japan Times which may explain the failure to issue a new edition through that decade.There is now a second edition (Oct 27, 2011) at this amazon page:http://www.amazon.com/Genki-Integrated-Elementary-Japanese-Edition/dp/4789014436Were the workbooks updated?Students are often glad that the same edition is used year after year when buying used textbooks. But imagine using a 1979 text unchanged in 1987 (no personal computers, no laptop computers, odd-looking radio-telephones ...)There is an edition of this older version with a CD but it is not clear to me that the textbook was improved."
2,Thumbs down,"Weep No More My Lady.Sorry, this books just didn't do it for me though I wish it had. I have read many books by this author and enjoyed all of them, especially, Pretend you don't see her. This one though, ....Oh wellI feel the Characters found results too easy and a line of though for the characters was not concise or even given. The main character, Elizabeth, tends to have many epiphanies. Too many.And that annoying Alvirah is heard and not seen, not really her style."
2,"'Tis Okay, Typical Mary Higgins Clark Script","Weep No More My Lady follows the Clark formula for her stories. The suspense and guessing part is to find out who amongst the people surrounding the principal players is the killer. Clark was okay, but is now beginning to be a ""read one, read all"" type."
5,It Was The Best!,"Weep No More,My Lady was a great book! I thought it was the best book Mary Higgins Clark has ever written. It had suspense, romance, and very nice detail! I would have given it 10 stars but there's only 5! I would suggest this book to anyone who likes to read!"
4,My Opinion of This Book,"This book was an easy read and it always kept the reader guessing. It toyed with two major questions did Elizabeth's sister commit suicide or was she murdered? And if so why? This was a classic Mary Higgins Clark. And like most of her books it goes along with a song intitled Weep No More, My Lady. She allows you to learn about the closeness of Elizabeth and her sister Lelia. This is a must read for Mary Higgins Clark fans."
1,Strange,"A fox terrier with a broken neck. A tortured donkey. A German Shepherd trained to kill. What was up with all this animal cruelty? Not only did it make me not like the book, but it soured me a bit on the whole series and on the author.This series has long been the better of her two, but it's starting to lose steam. Vida needs to be killed off already, because she's got to be one of the most annoying characters around. Get off the fence with Milo, Emma. Cut down on all the""colorful"" characters because there's way too many and it's hard to keep track of them all.Definitely not a good effort."
4,review from lecturer,i used this book for some lectures i taught second year undergrads in a biology dept at a big uni ... it is a tad expensive (like all text books) and i would probably try to pick it up used to be honest.. (the development text books don't change that much year to year ..) and in the usa the undergrads are not expected to be using primary research papers by the second year... all in all a good book of its type.
2,A good source of pretty pictures for your lecture presentation....,"I used Wolpert's text for an undergrad developmental course. Given that the test assumes previous coursework in genetics/biochemistry, the content of the book could've been more in depth, especially in the chapters on vertebrates. Sometimes extra detail makes the big picture easier to understand; this book leaves a little too much to mystery and results in a confused reader. The glossary and index leave much to be desired. On a more positive note, the illustrations and photographs are as good as you'll find in any textbook. However, I suggest Gilbert's text."
5,"The best RL Stein Book. No, the best book.","Thousands of years of artistic and literary achievment have all mingled and evolved into once source: Say Cheese and Die. This book is why the written language was formed. To describe this orgasm of words is to describe the face of God himself. One can only say that he should look onto God himself for a description as no written language can ever describe even a foggy detail of what he is and what he looks like. My friends, pay whatever amazon.com is selling this for. It will be worth it regardless of the price. What is a peice of green paper compared to the most pleasure you will ever experience in your life?"
5,SAY CHEESE AND DIE,SAY CHEESE AND DIE IS THE BEST BOOK IN THE WORLD ANDI THINK THAT IS A GOOD SELER IVE GOT SCARED
3,Say Cheese By: R.L. Stine,"This book was of the normal, nothing really god, but fits my standers.Well, this book is about this boy, who went into this abanded warehouse, and found this poleroid camera. He took it home with him. When he got home, he took pictures of his family of friends. The pics were normal at first, butthey started to make the people look dead in the picture until they dissapered in the pictures. but the same thing was happining to the people in real life, there soles were trapped in the camera. Will he ever get his family and friends out? Find out your self..."
2,If you like techno...,"you might like this. But be warned! The original single is actually not on the album. While some of the remixes aren't too bad, most are like the Don't Cry for Me Argentina dance remix or the Titanic song techno style. Some songs just shouldn't be messed with like that. But the last remix is good, slower than the others."
3,okay if you're able to tolerate the irish accents,"The goddamned constant fake Irish accents in this movie makes it sometimes seem unwatchable. Cate Blanchett did a better job with The Missing. I never heard of the actual person Veronica Guerin. At first, I wondered if she was related to Bill Guerin. Apparantly not. The climax to this movie really brought a smile to my face. The main mobster was named Gilligan. It's sometimes predictable, like the cheesy, overdone scene that is supposed to be suspenseful where someone is on the phone chatting and there is someone at the door and it's trouble. Fallen had that too. I originally thought Joel Schumacher was a good director, but I won't say that now. The Client and A Time to Kill were good, but that was only because the books did all the work."
2,Don't waste your time,"When I saw that Cate Blanchett and Colin Ferrel were co-starring in a movie chronicling the life of the Irish journalist/martyr Veronica Guerin, I was immediately excited. Excitement however quickly turned to disappointment.The story is flat. Even Blanchett couldn't save this script, which is saying a lot considering her talent. Ferrel is in the movie for a total of 45 seconds. There are many holes in the plot, making me think that the movie was originally an hour longer, and they took out random scenes in production. That's how jumpy and uncomfortable it felt to sit through this film.Blanchett is her usual good self, but this is a waste of her talent and your time."
3,Odd Fit,"What you can't tell from the picture is that this is HUGE and floppy. It looks gigantic on my king size bed. The actual texture and color are great, but the case itself seems too big for a standard euro pillow and the edges are too big and floppy. I'm hoping to shrink it slightly with the first wash. This would look ridiculous on anything smaller than a King - however would make a great floor pillow in a large room."
2,It took 192 pages to make a simple point,"Stay calm. No matter what happens, stay cool when you win and lose. It takes practice to control your emotions and that is the basis of this entire book. I think that if you had some time on your hands, and didn't mind wasting a couple of bucks, than I am sure that you will enjoy it, but I wouldn't recommend it. There are some concepts that you MIGHT find helpful, but you have to sort through all of the non-essential info first.Remember: This is MY opinion of the book! I am not much of a critic either."
5,"Sheer talent, beautiful tunes, and interesting lyrics ...","... this CD is a work of art.Ladies and Gentlemen, I've heard music from all around the world; I've heard it all. This is one of my favorite CDs. I love the lyrics. I love the melody. These boys can pick, and they pick well. If I could have met them all, I would have given them a hug for all the hours of joy they've given me. Seriously, along with Bill Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys, and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Lester Flatt, Earl Scruggs, and the Foggy Mountain Boys will be one of the best purchases you could ever make."
4,Classic fragrance but not for everyone!,"When I first applied Cabochard, I had a what-the-heck reaction. What was everyone thinking? Herbs & citrus was not what I was expecting from this revered leather. Thankfully I waited, patiently waited. It was an hour before Cabochard began to peel back its layers. First, the beautiful floral heart that is not overtly femme. Then, a smoky, dry strapping leather to rave about. Later, almost a worn & loved suede jacket. It's love.I'm uncertain how wearable Cabochard is for me because it hasn't passed the DH (darling husband) test. However, I now have an appreciation for this new-found classic, and I better understand where citrus-leathers (like the lighter & well-done Cerruti Image Woman) may have got inspiration."
1,Not the original Cabochard,I used Cabochard many years ago. It was introduced in the 60's. This product is not the same as the original perfume. It has a very strong and unpleasant (to me) aroma.
3,Not the original recordings,"The other reviewers must be blind or be working for the record company that released this slight to the great Jose Feliciano. There are no liner notes except for a summary of his career. There is no recording information whatsoever--no recording dates or previous release info. And, these are not the original recordings of at least some of these songs as recorded in the 60's. For instance, ""In My Life"" uses background strings instead of flute as on ""Feliciano!"" on which the song first appeared. ""Light My Fire has also been rerecorded. For the others, who knows when and where they were recorded? They are still beautiful recordings, it's just a shame that this is a hastily thrown together package.Total time is skimpy too: 94 minutes between the 2 CDs."
4,Another great read,"This book is detailed and extremely informative. I also just picked up Sailing Ships of New England which is an equally great read. If you're interested in the historical importance of ships, I highly recommend it. It's full of great illustrations, and makes for an interesting follow-up to Last of the Cape Horners."
3,One of the best of its type,"Music in every room starts with the simple premise. Can two people, involved in a rocky relationship, make things better by escaping into the bigger world together? Like reading Moby DIck, even guessing at the endgame of this saga is foretold.The getting there, like all travel stories is what makes this book wonderful. Traveling to all the well know dreamy eyed escapes that Westerners love, each provides a series of dreadful reality checks for the author. Can a couple make things better when they are all stressed? Could removing your jockstrap on a Nepalese trail be worse than the groin injury that caused you to wear a jock in the first place?Why do dyspeptic people write the funniest stories? The darkness and occasional self lacerating wit makes this a great read. Although I gave it three stars, it is really worth reading."
4,Musical Mickey Watch,It worked great and looked great but in the first week it managed to loose the button for the music to play. Sorta the point in purchasing this item. The replacement so far has been on my wrist for a week already without any further incident so I'd gather it was a single defect event. Love that it plays the Mickey march. Works well in my business with children if I need a distraction to get there attention.
2,LIke Gilligan's Island On A Bus,"The fog shrouding London is as thick as pea soup. A relief bus from the airport with seven persons aboard are going around in circles due to the low visibility. There's also 200,000 pounds sterling of purloined gold bullion is in the trunk and the mastermind of the heist is one of the passengers. Who could it be and do we really care? Not really. Frankie Howerd as the driver mugs for the cameras. Petula Clark as the stewardess-escort is efficient. Margaret Rutherford as the pushy old lady blusters. Mundane to the extreme. If Petula sang a few bars of ""Downtown"" it could have helped matters."
4,Emotional Intelligence: Key to Success,Daniel Goleman has made a huge contribution to Executive Coaching by defining emotional intelligence and providing strategies for life and work.
4,All you need to know about EI,"""People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel"". Brilliant. Very well said. And if you agree with this, you ought to believe in Emotional Intelligence. And if you do, just do yourself a favor by reading this book.It was an absolute delight to read and understand each of the 13 key relationship skills explained in the book; yes, all with great practical examples that you can apply from day 1. It surely helped me to become a better person and would certainly help anyone who wants to improve his/her ""inter personal skills"", a much/must needed trait I guess, especially in today's ""world is flat"" much diversified work environment."
5,working effectively with co-workers,"a followup to emotional intelligence a good foundation book to understanding the compleities involved with the office place. during the course of reading the book, i would often think 'oh yeah!! thats how i feel! or 'I wonder if I'm looked at that way?"
3,EQ at work,"This is a nice addition to the original ""Emotional Intelligence"" book by the same author. Although some of the examples seem to repeat the information from the original book, overall idea is quite nice. I found myself to be a little bit more intuitive to people's behavior at work after reading this book. Sometimes one can just ""feel"" that something is cooking although one will not always know what exactly it is. Next one to read would be ""Social EQ"" by this very same author."
2,Buyer Beware,"In the first place I received an older version of this book. I waited so long for it that I decided to go ahead and keep it. I just hope that it is not much different then the version that I ordered as I have to write an essay on the book when I finish reading it. If it is then I will be very upset with the store that I bought it from. Plus, it took forever for them to ship the book in the first place."
4,Emotional Intelligence in daily worklife,"I came across the name ""emotional intelligence"" in different media: newspaper, TV and even advertisements. However, I have seldom been able to look at the whole topic inside out.There are several items that I have learned after reading.1. EI can learn at any age2. EI is not favourable to any gender.3. People implicitly evaluate your EI to decide who is more suitable for a senior position.4. EI needs a lot of practice, learning and review.After reading the book, I decide to read the original one ""Emotional Intelligence"" to know more and have a deeper understanding on EI. I believe this book has already started changing my views in daily work. Recommended."
4,Read The First Book First...,"...with all apologies to Steven Covey. While Dr. Goleman spends a little time introducing the ideas of ""Emotional Intelligence,"" that is no substitute for reading the earlier work.Great ideas, though not quite broad enough to form the basis for a comprehensive organizational development strategy. Goleman is still more clinician than O.D. specialist."
2,Too Much Science About Emotions,"I feel the premise of Goleman's book is highly relevant to those of us who work only to be undermined by feelings and emotions gone awry. I expected a ""back-to-the-basics-common-sense"" approach, but rather I got a lot of science and intelligence-speak."
4,Book,So far the book is good and I plan to read the whole book. Working with Emotional Intelligence was recommended by co-worker. Have not finish but seem like a good book.
2,Sheer Disappointment,"Compared to the auther's first book that has bought me such a new insight into human nature, the second book is like an old man reiterating what he has learnt in the past and see everything through the same len. Maybe what he said is still right, but it gives me a feeling that the idea are not all interconnected, well-knitted and insightful. The theme of the book is simple: The business circle has further proven his EQ theory. The volume of supporting data only highlight the hollowness of the idea presented in the book"
2,A Sequel With No New Idea,"It looks like the author is trying to spread his gospel of EQ to the business world. His message is, to succeed in business, your organization needs to become an emotionally intelligent organization. It should be full of EQ staff. Or, to put it the other way around, if you want to succeed in an organization, you should be an EQ person. Then he goes at length to tell stories to support his proposition.Unlike Emotional Intelligence, this sequel is light in contents. The book is loaded with interviews and observations. There is almost no new idea for those who have read EQ. It is admirable that the author can make it so thick (383 pages)."
5,Great - but so sad,"I think it might be hard to appreciate this without an understanding of the musical context of the late 80's. MTV was full of hair metal bands and the beginnings of hip hop. Mother Love Bone was so different -- a throw back to the 70's but at the same time very new and forward. Listening to this now (2009), I can't help but remember the Seattle that existed at the time and feel very sad that it's gone."
4,Andrew Woods Swan Song,"As I think back on all of the musical talent of the Seatlle Sound in the early nineties. I can only ponder on what would have been if the drug of choice, heroin hadn't taken so many of them, especially the vocalists of that era, Layne Staley, Kurt Cobain and particularly Andrew wood.Although, Malfunkshun was a great band, in which Andrew Woods vocal talents began to gain noteriety, this album truly defines him as a lead singer.I believe that if Andrew Wood hadn't been taken so early in life, he would have been a mega-star and Mother Love Bone would have been mentioned along w/the great bands of that era such as; Soundgarden, Nirvana, Temple of the Dog, The Mudhoneys, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam etc.Highly recommend if you want to listen to Hardcore, Blues and Anthem Metal combined rock n' roll.In my humble opinion one of the best eras in rock n' roll history.Enjoy!!!Billy G-Drive"
5,before PEARL JAM,"This is BONE cd to get. it contains everything recorded by the young band before ANDREW WOOD'S untimely death.groove seatle rock.The sound is reminiscent of early Pearl Jam, mainly due to the inclusion of Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament in the line up, but with a beautifully haunting edge on tracks like Chloe/Crown of Thorns and Gentle Groove, which would probably have to go down as my favourite song of all time. The harder rock of This Is Shangri-La and Mr Danny Boy is just superb, as is every other track on this amazing album."
1,Negative One Star,"I knew within the first 90 seconds (near record) that this made for TV film was going to be a ff (fast forward) genre movie. The give-away - you ask? A script that is 90% pointless fake military jargon e.g. ""clear"" and lots and lots of swearing. It's obvious that the script writers, actors and director have a psychological issue with how they've spent their lives in Hollywood boutiques and are overcompensating by creating toughness the easiest way they know how - let's talk tough. Besides the totally, totally unbelievable tough guy/woman acting was the single day rental fee for a helicopter and some industrial warehouse basement to provide the obligatory concrete passages and steam piping. The story was nothing more creative than the time worn plot of the military hiding an alien or devil or whatever. Finally, the prosthetic makeup infected skin and gunshots were so juvenile dumb - yawn."
2,Shameful quality,"I really hate having to give two stars for this, but Paramount should hang its head in shame for releasing any DVD set with quality this poor, and doubly so for such a well-loved series as this. I have at least one season of about 20 different TV series and the video in MacGyver by far the worse I've ever seen. Nothing in my collection looks anywhere near this bad, and I have shows of all ages and types. Oh, and the extras. There aren't any. Double shame on Paramount.This just another case of Paramount figuring they can sell junk because the fan base is so loyal. The did something similar with the Star Trek series: good quality in that case, but no extras and exorbitant pricing (which they are only now starting to change). I haven't bought any MacGyver myself, but I've watched some of the DVDs that a neighbor of mine bought and I'd never give Paramount a dime for these, if only on principle."
2,Super Reader,"A lot simpler this one, as Rush and fellows race around doing the superhero thing - a bit shorter too, and really this could have been broken up or expanded a bit, as a whole lot of stuff thrown together too quickly for this novella type publication, with nowhere near the character interest of the previous installment."
4,bold and simple pleasure,"this movie is entertaining and the dvd does it justice. no extraordinary features wowed me, but they were as insightful as you'd expect from the makers of a creative flick like this. david hyde pierce is always a pleasure. here, he taught me the use of drinking from the bottle. no, that's actually a lame thing to say. drinking blood, though, that's a riot."
2,OK....,"I thought this movie would be a lot better than it was, but I guess it wasnt all bad. The cinemitogorphy was wretched and some of the actors like Julia Roberts, David D, etc...didn't play their charcters well and were very boring. The only role that kept me in the theater was Nicky Katt playing Hitler. He was very funny, great at improv, and did a great job. He is also hot! Anyway...I wouldn't reccommend seeing this movie, unless you're a Katt fan."
4,You'll be Nightclubbing in your own home with this CD,"This CD is great and has some of Blank and Jones best music, a must buy CD.Beynd time, Heaven (can wait), and Nightclubbing are the best tracks on the CD all very good dance tracks especially beyond time.Dj Fans and freaks, Fragile and Darkness are quite good dance tracks, they tend to get boring after youve listened to them a fair few times. Tribal attack and Electric circuis are rubbish. Secrets and lies is not to bad and Invocatio is just an intro."
3,Strange Morality,The characters in this mystery take it a cut above most of the genre. I was enjoying the book until the reveal of one of the murderer's motive and how the characters accepted it as justice. Totally turned me off and I am unlikely to seek out another book in the series.
5,Absolutely Great!,"My favorite movie of all time has got to be The Lion King. I never knew what I liked about it, but all I know is I've loved ever since I was 5 years old (I'm 12 now). The music is just wonderful. There's just no better way to say it. The Lion King 2 wasn't as good as the first one, but the music was absolutely amazing. There are some similarities between the songs, such as ""Be Prepared"" and ""My Lullaby"", ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"" and ""Love Will Find a Way"", and ""Circle of Life"" and ""He Lives in You"". Overall, the music is amazing. I loved the movies, and I loved the music. Anyone who loved the movies will love this CD set."
1,Be warned,"Lots of people like this series, but I can't personally call it better than ""mildly amusing."" In fact, it's generally so ""fan service"" and insipid humor based that it's barely even watchable. If you like ""Those Who Hunt Elves"" you'll probably like this. If not, don't plan on being able to stomach this more than once at best. Buyer beware."
1,product rating,massager appeared to be used as the motor was not strong (we have owned one of these in the past) I returned this for an unsatisfactory purchase
3,It's okay,It is strongWish we would have bought the two speedWould be nice to have a lower speed alsoIt is heavyOver all its ok
5,The best book i've read,We share everything is a good book. My favorite part is when the teacher faints. I recommend this book to first and second graders and teachers. I think two and three year olds would like this book. I like this book.
5,The best book ever.,"I think that it was a good book because they screamed, fought and shared everything. My favorite part was Jeremiah screamed and Amanda shoved the book in Jeremiah's mouth. It was funny. It was also funny when they were fighting for the Lego piece. My favorite character was Jeremiah because he was the funniest one. I like the pictures because they're funny."
1,Not great if younger siblings are listening,"This is one of my 6 year old's favorite books. Unfortunately my 3 year old has memorized it & thinks it's appropriate to say, ""If you don't give me ....., I'm going to yell and scream!"" and, ""If you don't let me have those....., I'm going to knock them down."" I wasn't thrilled about the sexist ending either. Robert Munsch often starts with a great premise, but goes overboard with the rude language. There are so many other ways to get kids to laugh; it's too bad that he resorts to this so often."
4,Classic Sara Vaughn,"A real treat to listen to. Soulful, sassy, well composed, some of her great songs for sure - but not all of them."
2,Inadequate,"This mop was a disappointment. It leaves a lot of water on the floor and also leaves streaks, doesn't seem to soak up dirt or water.I'm taking mine back to the store for a refund."
1,Made in China,"My vet has my dog on a very limited source of low fat treats due to her impaired fat metabolism. She suggested chicken jerky, but specifically said to avoid those made in China due to all the contimination problems they've had.I searched here on Amazon for ""chicken jerky"" and one of the suggested searches that popped up was ""chicken jerky dog treats made in usa."" Great! I used that search and this was listed at #8 on the list. Nowhere in the product description did it say it wasn't made here. I ordered it and was unpleasantly surprised to find ""made in China"" on the label, when it arrived.The FDA has several warnings out on dog chicken jerky treats made in China. The latest ones were Nov. and Dec., so it's an ongoing problem. I never even opened the jar, as I didn't want to harm my dog.Had the country of origen been in the product description, I never would have ordered these."
5,The ultimate in Fashion and Safety,"My daughter got a pink Razor Scooter, so of course we had to accessorize with the pink Razor helmet! She loves it and is always running to put it on before she even thinks about getting on the scooter, which makes me not have to worry as much about her being safe"
3,Size !!!,"You see the product description up there where it says 5 and up twice?! Yes? Well, this helmet is not sized 5+, like you might think. Nope. It is size 8+. It is difficult to buy helmets online because no one posts something as simple as the size of the helmet. So, your sitting there thinking this helmet is a 5+ because it keeps saying 5 and up in the description, you order the helmet for your 5 year old, you get the helmet and it is 8+. So, if you are looking for a 8+ helmet, this is for you. If you are looking for a 5+ helmet, better luck next time."
5,Happy girl,"This purchase was for my three year old great granddaughter. She is extremely happy with it. It was on her birthday wish list and the parents are pleased with it, also."
2,Not very comfortable,"So we really wanted this helmet to work out, but it's just not comfortable. Looks cute, but just isn't comfortable."
3,"Almost four stars, but funny fit","This is a nice quality helmet, and my daughter loves the pink. It's not too metallic and shiny - more like a satiny finish. She likes the 'skateboarder' shape of it (unlike her round bicycle helmet she had outgrown). The straps and padding are nice, and unless it gets thrown around a lot, it seems like it's going to be pretty durable. We give it three stars instead of four because of the fit. This is a very, very round shape. She has a round head, but even on her, the helmet has gaps on the sides, and presses on her forehead slightly. On my more narrow head, it was extremely uncomfortable and wobbled from side to side. She says it's not uncomfortable on her, so even though I probably would have sent it back and tried for something with a better fit, she's happy with it and doesn't complain about wearing it."
5,A Favorite,"I have read this book many times since I first encountered it over 20 years ago. Dr. Lindner, sadly deceased too young, bravely recounts his treatment of five extraordinary individuals. He was a psychologist and applied psychoanalytic technique along with tremendous intuition and empathy to the treatment of the sort of people that might be considered untreatable. He gave them time to heal, and mostly they did. This book, this man, is an inspiration to me (I am a psychiatrist). He demonstrates kindness, patience, rigorousness, the ability to surmount prejudice and a willingness to go to the ends of the earth to help a patient. He is not perfect and they did not all get better, but what a great book for someone embarking on the impossible profession of psychotherapy."
2,Nothing new here,"There is nothing new in this book. That doesn't mean it's bad, but all it offers is a simplistic (but helpful) rehash of what you've probably read a thousand times or more. It's sort of a two-step ""Eliminate the negative, accent the positive"" approach, to paraphrase the old song. Nothing wrong with it. If it helps you, fine, but the book and its little process offer nothing original."
5,Amazingly wonderful!,"This grill is wonderful. Even though you can't tell from the pictures, it is a real outdoor grill, just like a charcoal grill, but electric. I cook everything fron chicken, to fish, to burgers and hotdogs, to grilling vegetables. Even though it is portable, it has ample cooking space. It can also be converted into a charcoal grill. Clean up is easy. I line the bottom with aluminum foil, and use cooking spray on the cooking surfice. It cleans with just a sponge. I highly reccommend this grill, especially for apartment living!"
1,Poorly made shredder lasts but a while,This is a light weight low cost shredder that stopped working 6 months after I purchased it despite very light use. The shredder now works only one way not both ways hence you can shred provided you are inserting paper from below and want it to move upwards as its being shredded. Needless to say becomes useless at this point.
2,Good historical document. TERRIBLE EXAMPLE OF LENNY IN ACTION,"Lenny Bruce was at about the end of his rope when this performance was filmed. By that time, he appeared on stage with a court manuscript talking about all of the mistakes the peace officer made who wrote down his act and used his notes as evidence of Lenny's obscenity. Bruce was ultimately found guilty on that evidence and this film was Bruce's rebuttal to the verdict.Unfortunately, the performance is not funny. Funny is Lenny Live at Carnegie Hall, his albums and the ""Thank You Masked Man"" cartoon included on this DVD. If you are familiar with Bruce's work before seeing this you will likely be filled with little more than just sadness at the sight of what years of legal problems did to a funny man.It's a good historical document and if you want laughs, at least the cartoon is funny but you will find much better examples of Lenny Bruce the comic in all of his glory on his albums and the exhaustive box set ""Let The Buyer Beware"""
3,Worth it for less.,"TCM has it at their site for 12.99. Worth that much only for ""Thank You Masked Man"""
2,O.K.,"As a die-hard fan of Lenny who was born after his death, I must warn those that in this he strictly just goes over his court problems and doesn't do routines or bits."
1,Not a Driving Lamp Unit,"This is not a driving lamp unit,(Not an individual driving lamp). It is only the lens/reflector assembly and does not include any housing, mount, cover, bulb, or internal wiring to the bulb."
1,MISLABELED & MIS HANDLED,"I ORDERED THIS CD THE PACKAGEING AND CD SAID TAVARES LIVE. THE CD WAS AN OLD COUNTRY ARTIST.I WAS SENT ANOTHER COPY THE SAME SAD MUSIC,THE SAME PACKAGING AND SAME SAD MUSIC. I PAID TWICE TO RETURN 2 CD'S I WOULDN'T KEEP FOR FREE IF OFFERED. BECAREFUL WHEN U OPENA BOX U THINK U WANTED. YOU MAY WANT TO RETURN IT RIGHT AWAY.I WOULD LABEL THIS NO STARS IF I COULD."
2,Didn't work for me,"Didn't work for me. I have memory loss/ lack of concentration from Hypothyroidism, i hoped this would help correct that. Also got headaches if i went over 10 mg."
5,A book for all ages..,"I first read these three books my first year in Highschool. I loved them.. the action, suspense, and the excellent character development.But a true test of a books greatness is its ability to be enjoyed by people of all ages. I recently grabbed these from the library, and was pleased to find that they had lost none of their thrill.They are excellently written books that all ages can enjoy."
3,nice book,"I stumbled upon a used copy of Crace's Continent in Berkeley. Loved the reviews on the jacket, bought, and read it. It's a fine book, with lovely, simple prose. Like Paul Auster's New York Trilogy, the stories seem to add up to a novel. Light and easy, but not superficial or trite. These short stories leave me hungry for more Crace: I will certainly try his other books."
3,Clouds Roll,"A nice Hollywood biopic of Jerome Kern, like most of the numbers and a favourite actresses Judy Garland and June Allyson. Performance of Dorothy Patrick is good."
5,This is a new Joe.,Joe's sound has definitely matured. The song just goes to show that the right combination of music and vocals can take you a long way. I can't wait for his next dingle to be released.
5,TOTALLY AWESOME AND BREATHTAKING!!!,"I can't believe how wonderful this CD is!! Actually I can! Joey McIntyre is an amazing singer and person. He has definitely matured since NKOTB, but hasn't lost his talent. This song is so beautiful and I love listening to it. Hearing his voice brings back memories of when I was younger and in LOVE with him--he was my favorite from NKOTB. I can't wait to get the whole CD!"
5,Joe Mac is the BOMB!!!,"Stay The Same is one pf 12 fab songs on Joe's album. It is awesome! The best $16 I EVER spent! No kidding the style of music on this CD ranges from a 70's type song, to ballads to funk. It's perfect for anyone. I love it and Joe!!"
4,dimwit,"I thought this was a good movie, a bit pulled by the hairs but thoroughly enjoyable, joseph gordon Levitt is great, so is Matthew Goode and Jeff Daniels. I think it is a must watch movie"
5,"if you liked the movie,you'll love the book",I think it's not possible to have a precise idea of what mafia is before reading this book.Every chapter is a small piece of a big puzzle which shows you a world completely different from how you think. Great.
5,"The greatest book ever written, HANDS DOWN !","Like others I saw the movie before I read the book. I was amazed how much they left out of the movie. Don't get me wrong, the movie is one of the greats. But, the book goes into the backround of characters who have small parts in the movie. Some of the most anxiety filled moments in history are found in this masterpiece. The final chapters have staggering realism. With The Corleone Family extremely weak, the new Don, Michael, with one master swipe of his hand, returns HIS family to supremacy. A must read for anyone who....( fill in the blank ). IT'S THAT GOOD!"
3,Not bad.,"Not much can save the book itself, which in my opinion isn't all that good. But this is a very nice cast (especially for an audio book production) that doesn't try to overdo accents, inflections, etc., beyond what is clearly called for. I'd rank this well above the version that is read by Joe Mantegna.My biggest gripe centers on the packaging. Brillance Audio (like many publishers) uses a small package for the CDs which is nice, but the CDs themselves are housed in individual envelopes...very inconvenient and hard to keep in order."
3,"OK, but it's not as good as I remember it.","I read ""The Godfather"" eagerly back in 1971 as an 18year old, an 18 year old who didn't know as much as Iknow now, either about life or literature. I think Mr. Puzohas a good book here. Not a masterpiece, though Idon't know exactly how it could have been written better.It just seems to me a little more overdramatic andunreal than it did back when I first read it. 'Over thetop' might be the best way to describe it. I could not do itas well, not even close, either writing it or imagining,but I can't give it more than 3 stars."
3,"An Average Mafia Book, Nothing Special","This book was pretty good. However, I would not read it again as once was definately enough. I would not say the ""Godfather"" is a classic either, by any means. It was just an average book that was pretty good...If you are looking for a suspenseful book in the mafia genre, then this may be the book for you. Just don't go into it expecting a classic. A classic is something more on the level of ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" or ""The Fountainhead""."
5,The book so good it spawned 2 movies,"Th ebook is exactly like the movie except for a few touches that I really like. You get to hear what the charecters are acrually thinking. In the movie you had to guess by what they said(they always did a very good job). The secound thing that I really like about the book is that eventually Kay excepts that she is never going to change her husband Mike and ceases to moan and complian.Conclusion-If you liked the movie, you will love the book."
4,Godfather Mario Puzo kindle edition - not available in NZ :(,"why are some books not available in the Pacific regions - These are more not available.No mention is made of the fact that we down here can't get the full collection of Kindle BooksI would be pleased to hear when they will be made available and at least to be warned about this fact!The Fountainhead, by Ayn Rand,The Gatekeepers, a book about the US college admission process - not available."
3,Rare Occasion When The Movie Trumps The Novel On Which It Is Based,"I have this to say: this silly novel was badly-written, unrealistic, and it made those at the head of the industry of evil seem aristocratic, merely because they were sufficiently removed to keep their hands from getting dirty and bloody. The best thing that ever happened to Mr. Puzo was the release of the superior film version of this campy book. Because of the film, some of the gravitas there has transferred to this novel, which strictly taken on its own horrendously misses the mark."
4,"Good, but read it before seeing The Godfather II","I first read The Godfather when I was a teenager and absolutely loved it. Nearly twenty years later, I re-read it and was mildly underwhelmed. The fault for that, however, lies with The Godfather II movie because it expands the story so much beyond what is covered in the one book that the book feels incomplete.On its own, the book is very good. But I strongly recommend reading it before you see The Godfather II."
5,A Timeless Classic!,"What a story! Like they said, not just another gangster story, but a family epoch. A riveting page-turner that will live for decades!"
