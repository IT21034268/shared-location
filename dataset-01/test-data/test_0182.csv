3,The Godmother's Apprentice,"I really enjoyed The Godmother and found the Godmother's Apprentice OK, but I didn't enjoy this one as much, I felt it was too bitty."
3,"talking cats, what could be bad.","Cute story, talking cats, an easy read for a clearing the mind and cheering the depressed. I would read another in the series if I were having a tough day."
2,"Review of ""Vita""",I am very disappointed in this book. I am of Italian ancestry and my family lived in NY when they first arrived from Italy. I was anticipating a more rivieting story. Im having a hard time getting through it.
3,Vita: A Novel,"This novel peaked my interest primarily because I am Italian-American and my grandparents came from a town not too far from the town this book. It gave me an interesting perspective on those that immigrated, and hence what it might have been like for my own grandparents. It certainly makes you grateful for the ""easy"" life we have now. But it also makes me long for the lost connection to Italy that could have been my life. The book was well written but towards the middle it sometimes rambled but overall I enjoyed the book and would recommend it."
5,very helpful,over the years I've read many such books and this one helped me put so many things into perspective
3,Written for Men by Men?,"Advice to women by men on battering doesn't exactly make good sense since few men have lived the lives of oppression that women live when subjected to abusive relationships, and couldn't possibly relate in a meaningful way. Simply being human isn't enough to observe characteristics meaningful to the opposite sex - rather like a woman trying to provide a role model for male children on how to be males. It's comforting to know that all battering falls into two predominant types, however, using dog types as the analogy. I wonder whether many breeds of dog justfies the categorization. It's possible that characterized all males as forms of dog breeds might be more accurate to characterize their personality, being the territorial animals they are, even when they are neutered."
2,"Girls, Ghouls, and Guns...What else do you need for a good time? An aspirin","Dead Moon Rising, another zombie movie that looked good from the cover. But it doesn't have the touch that George A Romero or Sam Raimi (Evil Dead trilogy) gave to the public. The gun toting, crazy female was hot! If you are in the mood for cheesy zombie movies try Return of the Living Dead, because Dead Moon Rising had me out of my chair and returning my copy to the movie store. P.s. having the hero talk to the viewers about the issues going around him went out of style back in the 90s. It worked for Ferris Bueller, Army of Darkness, but not for this film"
5,Very Modern,"This film was made in the 70s and touches on so many topics that would have made it a banned film in the US. For it's time, it is a masterpiece and a great film altogether. It's very edgy, but what do you expect from a French film shot in the 70s?"
3,In Need of Commentary/Notes - Read Snorri's Prose Edda first,"Handy book with nice format and readable translation. However there's virtually no context here as far as a meaningful introduction to the individual works or the work as a whole. The individual introductions are cursory at best, written in a dismissive ""Oxford"" tone which assumes the reader is familiar with the works and their context. Imagine mixing up the books of the Bible, and removing most of the study annotations now included in most versions. Reading the Prose Edda first was EXTREMELY helpful, as Snorri does what the editor of this book should have tried harder to do herself. If you know little or nothing of Norse mythology, you'll be lost if you start with this book; but after the Prose Edda, things become much more meaningful."
1,An horribly inaccurate translation,"While it's popular to criticise the Hollander translation of The Poetic Edda for being more poetic than accurate, compared to Larrington's version, his is nearly ideal.I've been studying eddic poetry for years, both in the original and in translation, and recently picked up a copy of this book because several friends insisted it is more accessible and easily read. I immediately saw why it is often suggested as an alternative to the archaic language sometimes used by Hollander, but simultaneously horrified. Of course, no translation will ever convey the full nuances of a text, but I found numerous places where Larrington either lost all subtext to a passage, or was simply inaccurate.I would only recommend this translation for comparison to others, such as Hollander, Bellows or even Thorpe. The work simply does not stand on its own as a trustworthy edition."
5,Could Not Be Happier. Love This Net!,"I bought this a couple summers ago and have used it a LOT. I doubt you find a better net for the money. It holds up to anything, stays tight as when you set it up and wind has no effect on it.It's also great fun to setup at the park, next to a group of volley-ballers who settled on the $80 department store net.. thinking it was the best around. They'll be asking you all about this one by the time you're done playing.It's a pro net and if you play a lot, it's the net you want to get. It's been the standard for years and years.. and for good reason."
5,Park & Sun volleyball net set,"A friend has an older earlier model of the Park & Sun Spectrum that we've used for many years. Often we needed a second net, so I decided to get another of the same type. This one is great (as is the older one). It's real easy to set up and tear down. It provides excellent net action. I highly recommend it. I also ordered direct from Park & Sun some extra stakes to use with the old net and they were excellent to deal with."
3,"Great Movie, but Meg Ryan...","We loved the movie, my husband and I, but were a little disappointed in Meg. Hugh Jackman carried the movie great, he was charming, handsome and fit the part. But Meg Ryan is looking a bit worn for the part, perhaps due to her recent breakup, but her lips appeared swollen like she'd had some collegen that didn't take well, and her hair was awful. Despite that, I plan on seeing it again and will certainly buy it when it comes out on DVD!"
1,Worst Romance Ever!!!,"This is honestly the worst romance and attempt to comedy ever. Meg Ryan is the most unfitting for her role, I mean only Hugh Jackman was the most decent actor in this movie who made me give this movie a one star because he actually lived the role; everyone else, big thumbs down!!! This movie also is historically inaccurate; the Duke of Albany lived in England, not NYC; and whoever head of a Duke living in the US which is not a British colony anymore in 1876; and the time is set to 1876, whoever heard of Dukes living here in the post-civil war (reconstruction) era! Queen Victoria was this person's mother who accually outlived him! Duhh! Do some research James Mangold! Euckkkkkk! Horrible movie...Do not waste your time and money as I have!"
2,Meg Ryan - Ugh,"I can't recall any movie of Meg Ryan's where I disliked her character as much as in this movie. She is irritating and looks like hell to boot. Hugh Jackman is charming as Leopold but I kept thinking, ""Why are you wasting your time on this not very interesting dingbat""?"
3,On Anachronisms,"Leopold is so clever in correcting Kate's boss on ""La Boheme's"" being in Italian and not French, or that the lead character is Rodolfo and not Andre. (While we're at it, can we buy that a corporate bigwig living in New York can be that culturally illiterate as to need such correction? ""La Boheme"" is, after all, probably produced more than any other opera. I mean -- didn't the man even see ""Moonstruck""?) Since Leopold is from 1876 and La Boheme was first produced in 1896, Leopold is not only clever, but clairvoyant. Or perhaps, while Kate was at work and Stuart was in the hospital, Leopold was viewing a Puccini Special on PBS? And wasn't it also clever of Leopold to refer to Kate's boss as ""pond scum."" Now's there's an 1876 expression definitely due for a revival!"
2,Ryan was flat and colorless.,"I'm really sorry to be the lone voice of dislike, here, but this movie had no color. It was almost like Ryan was saying, ""The studio is making me do another one of these stupid romantic comedies."" She obviously didn't want to be tHere, whcih made it really hard for the audience to enjoy viewing her performance. Because she was so colorless, negative, and almost bored with her performance, there was really no chemistry between her and Jackman. He did a wonderful job, as did Schribner as her nutty ex-boyfriend. even her brother lit up the screen. Unfortuately, chemistry is the main ingredient in any romanitc comedy, and this one had no fizzle at all. I could have walked out halfway through, and never missed a thing."
5,Delightfully romantic & irrepressibly funny,"This is perhaps one DVD I'll watch till the disc melts in the DVD player.Dashing Leopold (Hugh Jackman) is the epitome of very vitally attractive gentlemanliness. And going by Kate's (Meg Ryan) expression in one scene, I was just as shell shocked. Horray for men who still have integrity all rolled up into one swooningly romantic package of gentlemanly courtliness. Bravo to this romantic comedy for bringing back a reminder of just how beautiful (so what if it's hokey?) romantic movies are without the blatantness of sex scenes or gory violence. This movie restores my faith in the movie industries talents and skills to make a film that offers funny, old-fashioned romance (even one set in the 21st century) without a lot of sex and violence. Even my 4 year-old niece watched this movie with me! All four times!A major plus to your DVD library."
4,Kate and Leopold,Great Chick Flick with a time travel bent. Very entertaining and I enjoyed watching it with my wife.
4,A very pleasant surprise.,"Kate and Leopold was a charming film. A bit of a fantasy and accidental romance. It was interesting and humorous as Meg Ryan falls for a time traveling inventor. A goofy sort of plot device, but the terriffic cast makes it work. The characters were seasoned and worked well together. It's a love story even a guy could sit through. It's what a film should be. It's good and light from beginning to end. Most anyone would like this film."
4,Hugh Jackman Elevates This Movie,"This is a pleasant romantic comedy about time travel that is truly elevated by Hugh Jackman's carefully constructed, nuanced performance. If you're a fan of Jackman's, this is a must see.This is not on the level of a Nora Ephron romantic comedy with her trademark witty character development, but it is amusing, sometimes thoughtful, and very romantic. Even Meg Ryan, who I've grown tired of as a rom-com staple, is better in this than in some recent films she's done. Breckin Meyer as Ryan's brother turns in a low-key, endearing performance."
5,Cute,"Being a Meg Ryan fan, this had to be a must-see, but I was pleasantly surprised with Hugh Jackman's input as well. They make a terrific duo, as well as Meg with Tom Hanks! I enjoyed the mild fantasy along with the time changing past-present idea. Along with Meg's charm, all this mixed together, gives the romantic-comedy lovers a sweet treat."
1,Are we sick enough of Ryan's shtick already?,"Once again Meg Ryan does her ""ain't I the cutest thing?"" bit in another boring film that isn't worth the price of a small Coke, not to mention the price of a movie rental!! Too bad there isn't a negative star rating. Barf! Barf! Barf! A great argument for why American society and culture just keeps getting dumber and dumber (but then, there are people who think Adam Sandler is funny, too, aren't there?)"
3,Romantic time travel...,"Leopold (Hugh Jackman), Duke of Albany and renaissance man, is astonished by a man who is in a crowd with a miniature item, which he later stumbles across at his announcement party for his bride to be. Leopold follows the man, Stuart (Liev Schreiber), and is pulled away from the 1870s into present time through a time portal. In present time he meets Kate (Meg Ryan) who despises Stuart and is a successful and ruthless advertising representative. Kate and Leopold is film that has some funny moments and witty dialogues, however, falls short in some aspects. Overall, the film produces a feeling of deja vu."
5,Great film,"I'm a sucker for a gentleman and Leopold is the kind of person that I married. Cute love story, huge fan of the lead man not acting like a douche and it's funny."
1,Stupid!,"Here is typical Hollywood drivel. A slightly new twist on a cliched plot, with so little fresh flavor to it. Meg Ryan looks like she was very bored making this movie, and plays a pale version of her usual, competent if not brilliant romantic heroine role. Her hair looks like it was cut with a hacksaw and she is getting too old for the emaciated waif look altogether. The only reason I sat through the whole thing was that I had bronchitis and had not much energy to do anything else."
4,A Contrast in Values,"In addition to being entertaining, I enjoyed the contrast between Leopold's circa 1876 values and Kate's ""money is more important than integrity"" set of values. At a time when character and integrity are frequently poo-poo'd as irrelevant by Hollywood, this is a welcome breath of fresh air."
4,"Hugh Jackman is brillant, handsome & quite the gentleman!!!","We went last night to see Kate and Leopold. Our family enjoyed it, and quite frankly cannot understand why so many people have been negative with this movie. As my daughter was in line with her father to get popcorn, people were saying Do not go see it.We thoroughly enjoyed it and would say to go and have a nice time. There is almost no swearing, and thank God there is not the sexual stuff, that most of us parents have to view. This is a movie that parents and children can see together. A+ per my 9 year daughter, my 12 year old daughter said this is a family movie. *Hugh stole the show, Meg was just okay in this movie, her brother played by Breckin Meyer is funny and of course Liev Schreiber is always joy to watch. Thumbs UP!"
5,"Hugh, take your shirt off! ;)","He turns a character that could have been an English fop flop into a chivalrous romantic lead. Whatever happened to the scene of Hugh in the bath tub, though? The scene made the trailers, but not the final cut. What a shame. I was beginning to thing it was a Hugh Jackman ""thing"" to give us a little pectoral peep in his films. Remember X-men, Swordfish, and Someone Like You? Heck, even Paperback Hero, I think. Oh well...maybe X-men 2 will make up for it.Oh, and the story was sweet.Hugh, take your shirt off! ;)"
3,Disappointing,"This movie is so slow in the begining, I kept yawning. It has a cute story but not-so-good acting and no action makes for a poor film"
4,New York Duke,"Duke Leopold might go onto invent the elevator. He might go onto get married to a New York heiress. He also might not. Stuart, a fourth dimension hobbyist has accidentally taken him through time to 21st century New York, back to his flat above his ex-girfriend Kate. Without the Duke, there are no elevators, and in a world with tall buildings, this is trouble. Stuart is determined to put Leopold back, but he ends up getting put in hospital. Leopold is left on his own, and gets a job in commercials for Kate. Being a Duke, he's well spoken and dressed. It charms not just the camereas...Worth a look. Twist of sci-fi here. It's entertaining enough. Hugh Jackman (Leopold) & Breckin Meyer (Brother of Kate) have a pretty interesting dynamic, my favorite scenes had them in it together."
2,Disappointing,"The performances were uninspired. We thought from the description that this would be a good movie, but we were wrong."
5,A brilliant folk tale of a tragic love - in Ukraine!,"This classic cult film by the late, brilliant director Sergey Paradjanov is still playing on the American and European college campuses or in art cinemas - from Berkeley to Boston, usually (and curiously) bundled with another cult classic, the ""Eraserhead"". It's about old traditions, mysticism, sorcery, and the inescapable fate, among the Ukrainians of the Carpathian mountains, in western Ukraine, known as the Hutsuls. Beautiful scenery of the Carpathians, native Ukrainian-Hutsul costumes, magical, traditional weddings and funerals all in the Ukrainian language, spoken in the region to this day. Film was released during the brief thaw under Krushschev, in an otherwise oppressive and murderous era of the old Soviet Union. The earlier comments about the film, erroneously refer to the film as being ""about old Russia"". The film has nothing whatsoever to do with old Russia."
4,"The Best In Non-Fiction, Action/Adventure",I chose this book because of its historical/political aspects in a very volatile part of the world. This would be a classic fictional action story. The fact that The Jewel Carriers is based on real people and real events made it very appealing to me. I read in two days when I was home sick. I could not put it down!
1,Price???,"I wonder why the List Price says $12.99 and the ""New Reduced Price"" is $28.99. Seems like an awful lot for 2 little stylus!"
5,THE CLIENT,"A sterling cast headed by Oscar - nominated Susan Sarandon makes this slick thriller the adaptation of a John Grisham bestseller. Mark Sway (Brad Renfro) witnesses the suicide of a Mafia lawyer, who confesses that the mob was behind the murder of a U.S. senator. Mark's brother is traumatized into a coma by the incident; gangster Barry Muldano (Anthony LaPaglia) is soon on Mark's trail, and in desperation, he arrives at the office of recovering alcoholic lawyer Reggie Love (Sarandon). With the mob after them, and a ruthless federal attorney Roy Foltrig (Tommy Lee Jones) trying to force Mark to reveal what he knows, Love battles to guarantee the safety of her client and his family. The relationship between Reggie Love and Mark Sway is the center of the film, adding considerable character development to plot's routine elements. Director Joel Schumacher helmed another Grisham adaptation, A Time To Kill, in 1996."
4,Not a bad thing...,I first watched the film and some months later I read the book. The story is very believable and very intelligent. Also the tensions during the film will never end. But there are so many differences between the book and the film. It's better if you read the book...
4,Smart script; great cast,"I'm not a John Grisham fan but I actually watched this film twice. The first rate cast made it worth it. It was fun watching all the smart people trying to outsmart each other. Susan Sarandon was her usual sexy, smart, stubborn and soulful self. Tommy Lee Jones gave her a good run for her money...they are an excellent match. It would have been interesting to see some more sparks fly between those two, but that would have been a different story. Jones brings his enormous charm and intelligence to what could have been a one-dimensional character. The boy, Brad Renfro did an amazing job for a non-actor. The rest of the supporting cast was good too.The relationship between Sarandon as the lawyer and Renfro, as the boy, is very well written and wonderfully played. Sarandon walks the line between tender and tough beautifully and she deserved the Oscar nomination for a memorable performance.four and a half stars"
2,DVD WAS DAMAGED CAUSING VIDEO DISTORTION .,"I SENT A E=MAIL TO PROVIDER LETTING THEM KNOW THAT THE DVD WAS DAMAGED AS I SAID THE AUDIO WAS OK, BUT THE VIDEO WAS VERY NOISY ( SIGNAL TO NOISE) LOOKED LIKE WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT IN A BLACK AND WITH MOVIE VERY GRAINY IN PLACES THE VIDEO JUST WAS BAD. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME READING MY COMMENTS.REGARDSW.A.TALLEY"
3,in my top ten list of court room dramas,tommy lee jones and susan surandon are awesome actors!together they sizzle!
4,Two good movies for the price of one.,"This is a great deal, because you get to watch two good movies at the same time, and only have to pay for the price of one. I enjoyed Armageddon very much as solid entertainment, nothing more, but I have to say that Pearl Harbor was the better movie. I had alot of fun watching it, and was totally thrilled by the 45 minute bombing sequence, that has some of the best special effects i've ever seen in a movie. I feel that Ben Affleck did a decent job here, and with armageddon, and Michael Bay is at the top of his form with these movies. Go out and buy these movies a together if you love action movies, because you won't be disappointed.Armageddon***%Pearl Harbor*****"
3,Short but still awsome,"Alright, these cables are very short. 10inches was what I thought would be enough but apparently I need a 12inch. and the head is a small concern to me. My hdd bays are perpendicular to my case so my hdd stick out. the head didnt fit my case because the case panal would crush it. I had to lower my hdd bay to get the cables to even remotely work. But the UV cathodes I have in my comp make this cable look freaking sick"
1,Terrible,"As others have noted, this book is geared towards ESL. No Arabic pronounciations are given (but there's plenty of English) so you'll have to use another dictionary to cross-reference. The exchanges are all English, and the big two-page world map will educate you on the English names of continents and countries. Don't make the same mistake I did."
2,"Incomplete, no phonetics","A dictionary without the appropriate short vowels is pretty sad. This one has no fatHa, kasra, hamza, or sukoon marks to assist with pronunciation if you don't know the word, and no english phonetics to help out either. As a reference, it is practically useless to the novice speaker."
2,Good for installing but nothing else,"This is a good guide if you are planning to install Linux. However, the version of Linux that comes on CD (RedHat 9.0) is SOOO!! easy to install this book proves to be a waste of money.During installation RedHat 9 asks you what you would like to install and it even tell you what the packages come with. My 60 year old mother was able to install it without this book or any help at all. (And she can't even use Windows that well)I wouldn't suggest buying this book unless you need the computer so watered down for you that it becomes a trouble just to find the ""any"" key (in this case you probably shouldn't be installing Linux anyway)"
2,Not very helpful,"You could spend less time looking up the information in the book, on the internet rather than spending time and money purchasing this book.I'm sorry, but I have to say that this book was NOT a good read overall. I was hoping for more."
4,How Meet Strawberry Shortcake should have ended,"Strawberry Shortcake's clothes get messed up with juice, her hat gets chewed up, and her house blows up, then EVERYONE DIED! The end.How do you like it?"
1,Barrington Oboe (just say no!),"I looked at one of these oboe's and was surprised that these were called""oboes"". I don't think the life expectancy of a Barrington to be morethan a year. I tried to post my disappointment on woodwind-brasswindonly to be shut down. I've never in my life saw such a horribleinstrument (and I've been playing oboe's for approximately20 years now, in community bands)."
4,Real classic series,"Please oh please we want this in digital format. This was a fantastic sci-fi series with the best on screen character out there Max Headroom, complete with his own computer glitches. I first saw this in Australia on TV and would love to have a DVD collector set."
4,Good for very mild exercise,"This is a soft foam ball that offers very little resistance. That probably makes it good for rehab, though it would be nice to have a slightly firmer version for progressively more resistance. The 3-inch size is good for medium-sized hands."
3,Over Rated,"""NeatReceipts"" Scanalizer is seen at airports and retail shops throughout the country. However, the product is slow, requires extensive input and does not produce the results it advertises.I would recommend a regular scanner and a reasonable filing system. The product is very portable, but for the price, it doesn't accomplish it's goal."
1,DOA,"We received the neat receipt scanner for Christmas to be used with our business. I spent 2 hours installing the software: updating the already out of date software, reinstalling because the first install and following update did not work and finally installing it cleanly from their website. This was on top of several restarts some of which interrupted the install process that was still ongoing. I then spent almost another hour trying to log in to their ""cloud"" using the email I gave them. I never gave a password but it still showed my email address as registered so I reset my password then it asked me a security question that was blank that I had not given an answer to because the setup had failed earlier. Once all the other issues were finally worked out the supposed document scanner would do nothing but return blank scans of the page. Returning for a refund..."
5,Neat product,"Neat Reciepts is a great way to organize for tax, business and home budgeting. It is important to keep your receipts and scan them the day you get them. Depending on the type of receipt the system sometimes has problems figuring out the correct total cost but it is easily rectified with a manual entry. The product is easy to set up and gets rid of lots of clutter."
3,You have to really want to use this software...,"I purchased this version Jan 2008. I tried to install the latest version of the software (confirmed by checking on the NR website) and it would only install to a C drive. I spent 3 hours IM'ing with NR staff & they finally got it installed on my computer. The software is really buggy. (Don't even try ""Smart sorting"" - I just scanned in 14 receipts in ""Smart Sorting"" & try to get them filed & the program just sits there - the status bar in the lower left shows nothing going on.) I have to manually start up the database each day. But when it works, this software is nice. But you have to really, really want to use it, since it's the buggiest software I've seen in about 10 years.PS - if you check my reviews, you'll find a followup review I did in July 2008 for the latest release of this software. In a nutshell, AVOID!!!"
2,Great idea - poor execution,"I purchased Neat Receipts after reading mostly positive reviews here and elsewhere but have been disappointed. At least 75% of receipts scanned are not ""read"" completely or improperly, and I end up manually typing everything into the program. Many businesses now use the carbonless receipts and the customer copy is a light yellow with faint imprinting. Neat Receipts will not recognize these types of receipts - I realize they are difficult but are also a large percentage of what I have to work with. Right now it is gathering dust on the shelf as receipts go into a shoe box, just like before. Can you say EBay?"
2,Not enough patience with faulty products,"Bought this item the other day. Received it last night. Tried it on a few things and seemed to work ok. Today I used it on several Home Depot and Lowes receipts. I am a contractor and bring home dozens of these receipts each week. Tooooo bad it will not read half of them. They are completely flat and I notice the scanner pulls them in and they slowly begin to rotate a bit. It comes back with errors galore. Waste of time, money, and my patience on this ""Professional Scanner"". I will be sending this item back. Rather keep my $170 and deal with it come tax time."
3,No Bad,"I was excited about this product when I first bought it. It works fairly well and does help manage paper better - particularly receipts. The software needs some ugrades, and then it will be 5 out 5."
5,Neat Receipts Scanalizer,"I have used this product for the last couple of years. With the lastest software updates it is an extremely good device. If you need to scan receipts and put them into an organized data base, this is the apparatus and software to get the job done. It is also easy to use and setup."
2,Misleading - Very Frusterated,"Regret paying $200 for this. Love the idea! If it really worked the way it was advertised I would be elated. The tempermental scanner works 50% of the time. To get the scanner to take my receipts is often a hair pulling experience. It freezes my Mac and I often have to reboot my computer multiple times to get it to scan. Other times it works as normal. The application certainly doesn't ""pull-in"" the data as the advertisement. It pulls in the wrong vendor, price, date. I basically end up manually entering all the information.I still have hope for this because I think its a great idea. If you want to use this to file and store your receipts than its great. If your purchasing this because you think it will save you time and energy - think again."
1,Scanalizer,I didn't receive the necessary SOFTWARE to make the item functional. I'd appreciate it if the vendor would please send it to me.
1,neatreceipt scanner,I never received the item i took me 30 days to get my money back from amazon. WILL NOT BUY AGAIN FROM AMAZON. PLUS I WAS DIRECT THERE BY NEAT RECEIPTS. THERE CROOKS THERE SCAMMING TOGETHER I THINK.
2,Does not work yet with MS-office 2007,"I spoke to Neat Receipts. They confirmed that the business card scanner does not work as yet with MS-Office 2007, the primary purpose for which I bought the product. They requested me to hold on to Neat Reciepts until July, by when they promised the problem will be fixed. I am waiting!"
3,"Good Idea, but the software could be much better","The software, which is really the bulk of what you are buying, is not efficient. It's designed for the novice user which could be frustrating for more advanced users. It takes forever to load the software when you start the application, and it uses a lot of memory (150+ MB Physical Memory and 400+ MB Virtual Memory)Overall, I am happy with it at the price that I paid for it ($140) but that would not be the case if I paid retail price."
4,Great Scanner with sub par software,"I used this to scan all my receipts. Scanning worked great. Software is ok, even after free update, but the export to excel needs improved."
5,"Funny, Witty, Loving, Suprising... amazing..","Because I am in a very conservative country, I don't get to read a lot of lesbian fictions. I finally bought my first lesbian fiction from Amazon and once I started reading this book, I simply refused to put it down.I love the way that Swannell potrays both her main characters, Jo and Cadie. While, I find the names she chose for them (Jossandra and Arcadia) somewhat cheesy I like almost everything else about it. She potrays a very very good image of the country I learnt to love so much, and you could almost hear Jo's accent while reading this book.One of the best aspects of this fiction was the way Swannell stacattoed witty remarks everywhere. I couldn't help laughing out loud at some of the comments she make.. and the way she beautify the simple language of English totally massaged my linguistic nature. Thank you Swannell for writing such a delightful book :) I would definitely buy more books by the same author from now on."
3,"slow, enjoyable romance set at the Great Barrier Reef","If you like slow-food, characters resembling the Xenaverse (dark, brooding, blue-eyed heroine, blond, green-eyed, shortish side-kick who are soulmates), a leisurely cruise in Oz with all the trimmings of Australia you are in for a good read. Of course there are villains and esp. an obnoxious US-senator who require some a**-kicking and also great mates all around.I read the re-issue as an ebook and even as a lover of slow-romance this book shows that it once was published as fanfic with lots of delays and repetitions. And it is no fun to see in a book which is priced as a re-issue for well above 9 $ the same old typos and some messed-up ebook-formatting."
2,Too Much Friction,"A great idea, but not well implemented. In mine, there is enough friction in the joints that the motion quickly slows and stops. The expected chaotic motion is barely, briefly present; the motion isn't very interesting.I'm an old-timer and haven't tried this out on a youngster, but I wouldn't expect it to hold their interest. On the other hand, I have found the ROMP pendulum to be fascinating to play with, even after much use. Both toys aim to illustrate the same chaotic motion principle."
2,Abridged release of original film,"This is a mildly interesting release, most engaging when Joe E. Brown and Zasu Pitts are on the screen. Jeanette MacDonald shows why she went on to bigger and better things, while the other men in the cast, including leading man John Garrick, show why they didn't make a lasting impression in Hollywood.The most disappointing aspects of the Kino Video release are the running time - only 67 minutes - and the black and white image throughout. The original print runs for 78 minutes, with the final scene in vivid (for the time) color. This uncut version with the color finale was recently shown on Turner Classic Movies. Dare we hope for a release of the complete original film?"
3,INCOMPLETE!!!!!,"Stars were knocked off for Kino releasing the 1937 edited version. Perhaps the full version with the color sequence was not available, but the full version should have been released if it was. This deserves a corrected DVD release. Otherwise, this DVD was of good quality."
3,Obscure Disney Flick,"It's not well-known and did not fair well when it came out, but ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" is actually a pretty decent movie. Ray Bradbury narrates and Jason Robards, Jonathan Pryce, and Pam Grier (WHO NEEDED A BIGGER PART) costar in this modest period family film perfect for those in search of some gentler scares this Halloween. You can almost smell the frost-covered pumpkin patches when you watch this movie. ""Something Wicked"" has the original Dark Carnival (sorry, ICP)."
2,Love Bradbury! Not so much love for screen adaptation -,"Something Wicked This Way Comes - staring Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce. A screen adaptation (1983) by the author, of his own novel. The film is good only during scenes with Pryce and Robards (it's VERY good). Yet, the plot is motivated by the actions of the characters of the two boys, Will Holloway and Jim Nightshade who, were inadequately cast (it's hard to find good child actors). Along with not being shot very well (Director of Photography, Stephen H. Burum [the writer of this review simply can't tolerate the day-for-night scenes.]), it seems 10 to 18 pages of the original script are missing from the final cut (the whole Tom Fury, B-Story). Much of the special effects scenes are cut in such a way as to reveal they simply didn't work and had to be cut out all together &/or ""cut around."" Much to my dismay, the story simply falls apart. Somehow, a beautiful script ended up as a film that, ""...had to be saved."" That's Hollywood..."
5,Favorite Halloween movie,"If you are looking for a family oriented movie for Halloween scares, this is your best bet. Appropriate for adolescents and above it may be too scary for very young children."
5,Great movie !!!,"I remember seeing this movie many years ago and it kinda scared me. Since I love movies that are suspenseful or scary, I knew that this is one I needed to add to my collection !!!"
2,Ho-Hum,"I was looking for a starting point for making bags...this is not it. They have a few cool bags, but I was looking for something a little more ""practical"" and frankly, a little more ""cool"". You know? Buy this book if you want a coffee table book, but don't buy it for anything else..."
1,Will not fit all models,"This is in case anyone ever reads this; two years ago I spent months tracking one of these down, they were scarce even back then. I have a NOCX-5M and the collar just behind the threads is too big for it to screw in. I assumed it was because I had a Marine model with extra sealing/gaskets. I did some research and several places said a NOCX-3 would work and bought one off Ebay--same problem! I assume they revised the models at some point to have a smaller mounting collar, but I have no idea which ones or how to tell the difference."
5,Another Shrek great,"A wonderful movie. I highly recommend it, especially if you have children to share it with."
2,Dissapointing At Best,"I was very dissapointed with this movie.After all the hype you would think that it would be a certainty that I would love it.I found it to be predictable,not very funny,the baby vomit scenes were gross, and the film was boring in general.The animation didn't even look as good as it did for Shrek 2.This movie smacks of being rushed into theatres to capitalize on the previous two films success,an undeniable fact that resounds throughout the film.They definately could have done much,much better.They should have spent more time in story developement and improving the overall animation.Even the music they selected could have been better!""Live and Let Die""by Paul and Linda McCartney was,in my humble opinion,the only truly decent song in the entire film soundtrack.My reccomendation for those of you who may not have seen this film is to wait until it comes out on DVD and rent,do not buy,it."
5,It Shrek and He Fat As Ever.,This third movie in the series. Is one for the girls for a change. The girls are the hero in this movie. Should of been called Mrs. Shrek. What not to love a fat green creature who is fatter then me by one size. Great movie for all ages. A must for ant DVD collection.
1,Watch out for shipping,Shrek The Third (Full Screen Edition)I ordered this DVD on November 28th for a Christmas present. I tracked the shipment of it and saw that it arrived in a USPS warehouse in Kentucky in November. There it sat for the next three weeks until I was notified by Amazon that they had received my return. It sure would have been nice to have received it in the first place. If you're counting on this for a gift - put some thought in how you choose for it to be sent.
3,Still Funny with Less Magic,"Although by the third movie most sequels are finding it hard to keep the magic. Shrek is no different. Amusing story, good animation, and another round of the characters we enjoy. This time Prince Charming is looking for payback and enlists the bad guys and gals from all the fairytales to help him. While Shrek is off looking for Arthur ""Arty"" Penndragon to take over a kings crown he doesn't want, the castle is invaded by Charming. All the fairytale ladies have to break out of the tower and give a nice fight sequence, but are recaptured. Shrek returns and with the help of Arty, saves the day. My only complaint is they put way to much time into sophomoric characterizations in the extras about the kids at Arty's high school where Shrek found him. A little is nice, but it went way beyond little. Nonetheless it is a nice addition to the other two movies. Great DVD quality and enough extras to make you sick of them."
3,Not the best of the Shrek series,"For anyone familiar with the Shrek series, this comes as no surprise when I tell you that this movie is the worst of the bunch. While not a bad movie per se, it is watchable but not as much so as the first two and #4 is. Still, not a bad movie, but does not live up to the other three, which is why you can buy this one for $4.99 versus $10-$15 for the other three."
2,Shrek the Third,"They said that this one was the best yet? I must disagree. The other two were great- this one was over-the-top. Neither I nor my husband enjoyed it. Thank goodness the kids did, but even so, its not one they will watch all the time- or even all the way through!"
1,"Much, much worse than any other Shrek movie","It's as if the movie was done by weird, immature teenagers. Honestly. The jokes are either cruel and just not funny. The plot is lame, dumb, and flat. The story happens in just, hmm, three places. The new characters feel flat, the original characters now feel flat also. Well, I can honestly say that neither parents nor children (at least those with a slightly sophisticated sense of humor) will be entertained by this."
4,Good family entertainment,"This is a great family movie, with gags for all ages. Whilst it is not the best of the three (in my opinion) it is easily up there with PIXARS more recent efforts.HD presentation is superb, with really strong colour and detail levels. sound is also very good indeed, with a lively mix that uses all the speakers in my 5.1 set-up.Good film, but leave it at that now. DON'T MAKE A FOURTH!"
1,Horrible!,"The movie didn't even work! It froze and never even made it to the title screen. Very disappointed with it, never had a problem with buying off of Amazon, but now I do."
1,Worst movie I have seen in a while,"How can I begin? I was so looking forward to this installment of the Shrek movies, that when I finally saw it, I was in shock! It was hands down the most terribly boring movie I had seen all year! I fell asleep about 30 minutes before it ended (something I never do watching a movie) so I asked my husband if I had missed anything good. He laughed. He thought it was as terrible as I did. Come to find out every single person I talked to after watching it said that it was as terrible as I did. Shame on the writers for making such a dull and boring movie after the first 2 were so lively and wonderful. Hopefully the next one will be more like the first 2, I would hate to see them end with such a horrible conclusion like number 3!!"
1,Unbelievable,"If the first two Shrek films did not exist, this one would be just a silly, stupid film (due to the dumb dialogue, foolish ""plot,"" in-your-face moralizing, excessive vulgarity, and... well, it would just be silly and stupid).But Shrek 1 and 2 do exist; therefore Shrek 3 is an abomination, a monstrosity; it is testimony to the utter intellectual collapse of those who wrote it.If you admire Shrek 1 and 2, I strongly suggest not seeing Shrek 3 at all, for even after you have cut the CD into pieces and thrown them away, it may leave behind a lingering stench that will slightly cloud your enjoyment when you watch 1 and 2 again.I guess that ""2"" is the magic number when it comes to film series. Godfather III, Aliens III, Shrek III--the third time is not the charm."
1,Pathetic - Don't bother - Horrible - Horrible - Horrible.,"This movie was a complete waste of time, totally disjointed and unorganized. the writing was lame, I don't think there was a script at all... Shrek 1 & 2 were fantasic funny movies... I rented this movie expecting a similar enjoyable experience.. 25 minutes into this DVD I had not cracked a smile, there were no jokes and the story just made no sense at all.Don't waste your time or money on this one... go get Shrek 1 or 2 over this disaster"
2,Not the best Shrek Movie,"Wasn't as good as Shrek 1 & 2. Too long, slow paced, not enough jokes...actually boring at times."
2,Disappointing!!!!!,"Thirs third time failed to charm!! Based on the delivery of the last two episodes and the amount of laughter one had received, it was like a total punishment to sit through 1 1/2 hours of nothing. There was not much laugh out loud moments in the cinema. The story line was extremely weak and I believe it also lacked research. What could have been a movie to talk about for years has disappeared in the minds of many."
1,"BAD MOVIE, VERY BAD","Both ""Shrek"" Two and Three sucked big time. The First one was good, probably the only reason to buy this Dud is because it is in High Definition."
4,Shrek 3,"This movie is a lot of fun, although not as good as the first two movies. There are a lot of both adult jokes (which are over-the-head for little ones) and kid jokes as well! Overall, Shrek rocks my socks:)"
1,Disgusting,"Like everybody else here, I found the first two Shrek movies to be entertaining. The second one was my favorite, since I thought its writing was the best of all three. But this one...ugh. It was just plain gross. There's too much bathroom humor. Who would want to see a movie full of burping, farting, butt jokes, and explicit depictions of vomiting? Not me. AVOID this movie, especially if you are sensitive to vulgarity. (In comparison, the first two movies did not have nearly as much crude humor as this one -- they were much more serious, which is why I enjoyed them more.)"
2,Borrow from a friend or rent....,"The animation is great, but the story line just did not live up to expectations. We bought this for our family (all members over 17), and while we laughed a lot at Shreks 1 and 2, Shrek 3 was a disappointment. Jokes were forced and we felt as though the writers were scraping the bottom of the barrel to come up with something new. This is one that we will not keep."
2,Milking it for More than it's Worth.,"I'm a 23 year old, and I was a huge fan of Shrek, a pretty big fan of Shrek 2, but I wasn't impressed by the Shrek the Third trailers. Shrek the Third has very little plot and no true character development. It's stagnant. It really feels like a collection of all the deleted scenes from Shrek and Shrek 2. Each scene is over the top and becomes irritating before it finishes. Many of the characters phase in and out of character. Worst of all, the movie seems no longer to have an adult appeal. It's a kids movie with a story so stupid you'd have to be a kid to not notice."
2,One to many,"I had hoped this installment would be as good as the first two films, alas this movie is no where close to as cleaver. I wish I could pinpoint exactly why it is not as good, but I suspect it is a combination of small points, from the cliche Aurthur character to boilerplate Shrek fear of fatherhood dilemma. For me the only highlights are Puss and Donkey, even Charming get tiresome despite Rupert Everett's wonderful work. To me these movies are pure escapist fun and I am not expecting anything more, but with this outing it is just no longer fun. Finally I find this Shrek has lost the wit the first two movies have, which may explain why it never worked for me. By the way I am not a very good writer mainly because I refuse to edit. Hmmm, perhaps I should move that to the beginning? Nah."
3,Shrek,Ordered at the same time as other products. This arrived almost a week after I received the other product.
4,Third Shreik,"Not quite as impressed as with the first, definately better than the second. Probably more impressed with the first as it was a new concept and new view at the Fairy Tale venue."
1,Don't waste your money on this one!,"If I had seen this movie before I bought it, I wouldn't have spent the money. Shrek #2 was almost as good as the first, so I thought this one would be reasonably good quality, too. Wrong!! All but about three allegedly funny/entertaining scenes fall flat. There's none of the original spark, and the whole plot seems to be a stretch to fill time.I see another reviewer here said there's going to be a Shrek 4 -- say it ain't so!If you must see it, borrow it from your local library."
5,Excellent Video,This is even better than the previous editions. It is enjoyable to children but has a lot of humor that is enjoyable to adults.Shrek The Third (Full Screen Edition)
4,Interesting Book!,"From the very first page, this book kept my intrest. I enjoy reading things about the LEEDS DEVIL, or the JERSEY DEVIL as commomnly known. This book had me rooting for the devil. I was drawn into the story. I hope that there will be a follow-up to this book, as I was left wanting more. There were things in this book for all. You were given an insight to local politics, the land, and the local people. You couldn't help but care what happens. I enjoyed this book. And hope to see more from this author."
3,Mother of Pearl is ok,"The product arrived in a reasonable time and in excellent condition. Unfortunately, I ordered to big of a size but the ring is still very beautiful. Great product!"
2,Outdated text,"This text is a classic and has been around a long time, however, it fails to reflect the current state of engineering graphics. A lot of the text covers the basics which is important in the understanding of drawings and documentation, but I don't know anyone who does board drafting anymore. Everything is done in SolidWorks, Pro-E or some other 3D modeling program and this book touches on it, but it is brief and not very infomative. With the technology we have today, this book should spend the second half getting students up to speed on creating models, drawings and assembly drawings in CAD programs rather than how things use to look drawn on paper."
4,"Some issues, but not a big disappointment","This books goes over several new weapons (Both martial and exotic) which may be implemented into your D&D; campagin. Though it's magical item section was rather disappointingly lax, it however, had useful details on various types of sailing ships, as well as mechanical flying devices.I would have perfered if it had included some tables to aid in the creation of your own vehicles, but unfortunately I was unable to locate any. All in all, however, it is useful reference, and the various new armor materials, weapons, and more will prove interesting for your campagin if you are willing to pay the price."
2,Hardly worth it...,"If you are expecting a comprehensive guide to arms and equipment, this is the wrong book for you. It brushes past those subjects and touches on a bunch of other stuff that has nothing at all to do with the title."
5,good bag,"exelente maleta para dj les recomiendo comparar es muy fuerte la maleta y resistente es muy buen producto, la he llevado a varios compromisos y es muy practica"
1,You do not own this Receiver!!!,"Directv will tell you that after you have ended your service with them, this item is THERE'S. You are not purchasing this item, you are purchasing a chance to lease this item. This is a way for Directv to take you money, do not purchase it. Also, if you end service within a year of activating, you will be charged a EARLY TERMINATION FEE."
5,hilarious,"This will be a great Christmas present for my 26 year old daughter who has a ""flawed dog"" of her own. I think this book would appeal more to a 12 years and up category. The variety of bizarre looking dogs coupled with the very funny rhymes made this a laugh out loud book for me."
3,Ultra Light Ghillie Jacket & Pants Woodland Camo.,"This ghillie suit is pretty good, but it could use some more jute in some areas.It is also mutch lighter and compactable than I expected, And that is a bonus.The pants are a little short for tall people, but other than that I would recomed it..."
4,Solid game,"This game is very impressive. It is easier to run up the middle and harder to pass than 99's version. There is one flaw in the game that I found. In a two person game, if you recieve a personal foul on a kick return and the penalty is accepted the referee picks up the ball, signals the penalty and drops the ball. He does not put it at the line of scrimmage, and you have to reset the game. Also, if you make too many substitutions the game may freeze up on you. Finally, the play control is slightly harder but more realistic than the previous Madden games. Other than that it is a very good playstation game."
4,Vampire Love,"This album has some great lyrics!Some songs are not that great but Ash does give you really great love songs.""Starcrossed""...saddest love song since I heard the Cure's ""Love Song"".""Vampire Love""..reminds me of Hellsing. The dvd that comes with it is really neat!""Girl from Mars"" is a unique music video and so is ""Clones"".Im so glad I got this record."
3,Gamer,"This game is great fun for one player. They've created a whole golf world to walk around in where you can talk to people, practice, accept challenges, and walk to the different courses. However, they don't allow you to play two player games on one gameboy. The only motivation I can see for this is that they wanted to force people to buy another copy of the game to play with a gamelink. This is a shameful ploy if true or at least a careless oversite. There is no reason that a golf game should require two gameboys for two players as both players do not need to see the screen at once. If I had known this before I bought it I would have got tiger woods golf instead. If your only interested in one player though it is a lot of fun."
4,Gerard,This sprayer is good.Pro: spray presuure builds up fast after a few pumps.Good spray nozzles from fan to narrow sprayCons: very heavy when filled with liquidno handle /belt to carry the sprayer aroundno release valve.Overall this is a decent garden sprayer.
2,More Planet Pirates,This is an expanded look at one episode in the Planet Pirates novel and is a bit much if one has read the other.
2,The Mystery of Ireta: Dinosaur Disappointment,"Anne McCaffrey is one of my favorite authors, but even that can't change the fact that I was greatly disappointed by this book.If you've read the 'Freedom' series, or any of the chronologically first 'Pern' series, then you've read 'Ireta.' It's another rehash of the same old storyline- Beautiful, physically perfect people trapped on an alien planet. How will they ever survive? Probably in the same way all the characters in her previous books survived.I was able to predict the ending with 100% accuracy from the first ten pages of the book, and though the last few chapters did take a turn for the better, it hardly made the previous several hundred pages worth all the time I devoted to them.One never really comes to care about the characters- They aren't presented in an endearing way, otherwise, Ireta would have been a much better book to read."
5,Beautiful Nail Style Cross,"I purchased this cross as a gift for myself for Christmas it was one of four cross's I bought myself and I am truly glad I did It is so beautiful, It means so much to me to be able to share my faith with others.When ever someone notices my cross it is and instant conversation starter and of course the conversation always turns to religion,we talk about where we go to church It gives you a chance that you might not otherwise get to talk to someone about God. and you never know when that might just be what that other person needs.So buy it because it might suprise you and help you reach someone, by it because it is a very nice way to share your faith and buy it because it is beautiful."
2,"Slow Down, Denise","I like this video but Denise is too fast. She needs to slow it down a pace for the beginners, like myself. Since, I've gained weight from a thyroid problem, I'm not that agile yet. She also doesn't show too many modifications. A good workout if you are an intermediate."
4,Nice workout,"Yes she talks a lot,but during the time you are working out you don't notice and is a nice not really challenging workout"
2,Super annoying,"I have had this DVD on the shelf for a while. I bought it a while back when some friends and I started doing various yoga/pilates videos together regularly. We could hardly get through this workout without pulling our hair out and choking the television set, not to mention rolling around on the floor laughing. Denise Austin does not shut up for one single second. And the stuff she says is completely ridiculous -- very little instructional help but lots of cheesy encouragement and nonsense chatter. Eventually we started muting the TV and playing our own music, but pretty soon it found a nice place on the shelf to gather dust. I can't even remember the workout aspect, except that it was hard for some of us but not for others, but I'll never buy another video from Denise Austin."
3,Informative and useful,"Denise Austin is a self-made health and fitness universe. She has a vast line of workout dvd's to address diet, spot fitness, overall fitness, even post-pregnancy recovery. If you want a workout with her effervescent and enthusiastic ""rah rah"", then this dvd is for you. It does require a small investment in getting pilates or similar mats, etc.Denise Austin's TV career has had two different forms. If you want the extremely comely version of Denise that was on ESPN for years, forget it. Those years(oddly) are not on this or any disk. That's a pity as she was perhaps the most beautiful workout female to have appeared in general broadcast. Alas....If you want the more current Lifetime channel ""Denise"" with extremely(I mean extremely) conservative workout togs, then this is for you."
5,Besy way to buy a DVD,"I got exactly what I wanted without leaving my house to shop. Best price as well! Quick delivery, 100% satisfied. I've been recommending Amazon.comPilates for Every Bodyto others."
4,tough for a beginner,"I started pilates this year and I love it. I bought Denise Austin's mat based pilates and loved it. When I saw her new video Pilates for every body, I immedietly bought it. It is a great 45 min routine. The only downside is she goes rather fast and does not give much instruction. Luckly, I had started with her mat routine video and I knew how to do the stretches. I love the new video, but would suggest starting out with the 20 min. Denise Austin mat based pilates first."
4,Fantastic - even for beginners (who don't give up :-)),"Excellent Pilates work out video. You can certainly tone and sculpt your entire body, especially abs if you do this 45 minute workout everyday or every other day! I sure did...I love that the exercises are slow & graceful. There are a few difficult exercises, but with repetition, you will be able to achieve the movements. Don't give up after a week and say things are not working....it reshapes the body. I lost 10lbs in a month and a half by doing this video every single day so there is hope!"
1,Entertainingly Stupid,"I literally almost lost my life watching this movie when it first came out. My friend went to see it and told me it was so funny that we had to go. The theater was jam packed and we had to sit in the front rowe. I was eating popcorn and we were both laughing so hard at how dumb and ridiculous that it was that I sucked a piece of popcorn down my throat. And when they tell you that when you are choking you can't make a sound... they are right! I managed to lean foward, stick my finger down my throat and dislodge the meddlesome piece of puffed corn.Now... that is how stupid this movie is. It is SOOOOOOOOOO STUPID it almost killed me. Now that is STUPID."
3,"entertaining, but terrible","Recently I watched this movie, it was fun but filmwise ""DUMB"". Come on why would anyone love seeing action and explosions instead of ""PLOT"" and ""CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT"" like in the amazing First Blood before it."
3,"Me Rambo, You Cheeta","What can I say, it's a Rambo movie. It is what it is. I like Rambo movies............"
3,He Went Home!,A pretty good sequel. Get the blu ray. Great picture & sound. I'm sure anyone can enjoy it even more.
5,all in blue ray glory,"really a good remake of Rambo 2, the best in the series in my opinion. clear and fine in HD. the only step back i had was my wish to see arabic subtitle, so i can i enjoy it with friends who do not speak english. but i guess thats the same problem with all new blue ray titles."
3,Good voices. So-so songs.,"I really only bought this album to get a copy of the song ""Und wenn ein lied"". The other songs aren't the quality of this song. I think most would agree that they aren't anything that would top billboard charts. They seem like 'filler' sings, sung to fill up an album."
4,"Comparable , maybe better than Playstation!??","A gift for my husband...he felt the quality was much better than our PS '99 Madden game. These games change so quickly though and now he is already looking at Madden2003 (or is it '04?!) Excellent quality, better plays, a good choice (if you can find it anywhere now!?)"
2,Smaller than Expected,"Nice enough looking, but smaller than I'd expected it to be. Tried to return it to the merchant, but could never reach anyone within the designated timeframe. Now I'm stuck with this item that serves zero purpose to me."
1,Should be higher,"I find it hard to believe that this book is way down at 207 thousandth place. It should at least be up in the 206 thousands. There are some neat ideas in here, but also some dogs. And speaking of dogs, that whole series of activities where you dress up animals is just weird."
4,Excellent west coast/chicago blues harmonica album,Very good album. Lots of well played harmonica with a great deal of chromatic playing.
2,"OK hold, but contains bad ingredients...","I like the feel of the gel, not too sticky and not too hard. On my hair it didn't clump up or get hard. The gel did hold my sides back...to a limit. It didn't hold it all day, just 2-3 hours or less. But that's not why it got a low rating from me. It contains petroleum and minerals not good for the hair. I ended up throwing it out because you don't need something unhealthy on your hair when the goal is to have healthy hair."
1,DVD arrived broken,"Unfortunately, had to return the DVD unopened. It arrived broken in the package. Nothing against the movie itself - we saw it years ago, it was the first and best of the ""Rambo"" series."
2,Guy flick,"But which guy? He must be caught and punished. But seriously, the director knows how to keep a story moving and Stallone's sympathetic (if over-acted) performance helps but when his character says ""let it go, or I'll give you a war you won't believe"", THE END should have come up on the screen. A nice little 45 minute movie ending satisfactorily. Unfortunately, the film goes on and a man in a grey overcoat and silly beret shows up with a pair of water skis and a rubber shark. This toe curlingly cheesy performance ends with one of the most embarrassing moments in film history. ""Don't do it, Rambo!"" Yells the afore-mentioned Colonel. Indeed, John, don't waste your bullets on Brian Dennehey, whose rather a good actor. Aim it where it counts. The man is destined to get you into more mischief anyway.Meanwhile, back at the ranch....(what's left of it.)"
2,Disappointing,"Its tender allright, but leaves lots of stubble behind. Not a close shave at all, & on your face, the stubble is very obvious. Wouldn't purchase again; not worth the $$ or the trouble."
4,Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within,People were disapointed with this movie. I liked it. I think thereshould be a sequel.
2,Fleshless is Bloodless,Who cares?interesting technological advancement but WHY?The end is no big surprise.neither is the middle or the beginning for that matter.
2,Final Fantasy?,"Wow, this movie really had NOTHING to do with the video games. The only thing that was the same was Dr. Sid, and he's really not that great of a character. The plot was needlessly complicated, the characters were irritaition, and there was very little action. The only reason to see this movie is for the effects, and I mean that. It's really got pretty cool gadgets and some cool death effects, but that's about it. Let me summarize, the plot SUCKS, the effects rock, and for that alone, I'm thinking of buying it."
4,GREAT MOVIE,"I know people are made that the movie had nothing to do with the games. Everyone please remember that the games are all different in many ways. The movie for example is a completely new world, new characters, and theme. And you really care about the story and what happens to the characters. That is what makes a Final Fantasy. Not Cloud or Squall swinging swords everywhere. People have just forgotten what makes the Final Fantasy series so great and that the storys."
3,Needs to work with story,"The animation was very good. SQUARE's animation has been high quality. The story is the problem. I was bored in the theatre. I have been reading Japanese comic books since my elementary school age, and own 4 game machines. Final Fantasy presented nothing more than the average level in the respect of the story. It is a good example to learn that master work in visual presentation doesn't get filmmakers to get them to the top. This is the first trial for SQUARE, I hope their second procudtion will be better. I thought ""Final Fantasy 9""(Game) was more fun to play than watching this movie."
3,Why Square? Why did you have to be so stupid.,"Okay this is one of the most amazing looking movies I have ever seen. It's worth watching just to watch the CG. The story is mush. And that's very surprising considering Square's penchant for spectacular stories. I will say this once. IF SQUARE USED THE CHARACTERS AND PLOT OF FINAL FANTASY 7, THEY WOULD HAVE MADE ONE OF THE GREATEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME. RANKING RIGHT UP THERE WITH CITIZEN KANE, THE GODFATHER, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, AND SCHINDLER'S LIST. As it stands though, it is merely an alright movie with breathtaking visuals."
2,If you like Japanese story lines...,"I'm not going to ramble like some of the other reviewers here so let me just say this: ""Mind-blowing animation"" but the story failed to hold my attention. I found myself watching just to see the imagery. I've always found that the Japanese have trouble editing their stories. They seem to want to put in everything but the kitchen sink whether it contributes to the telling of the story or not. In this film one can notice it's been edited for an American audience, but still, the story is very esoteric and not very believable, I don't care how spiritual you are. What a shame. Worth a rental not a purchase."
2,"Great CG, horrible story","Yes, it's amazing that this movie is completely computer generated. It's an unimaginable task to construct and animate a movie of this detail, and kudos to the army of animators and artists who created it.But the plot is awful - there is little in the way of suspense, emotion, or intrigue, and the ending was very disappointing. The CG characters and acting are wooden, and due to some shortcomings in animation, especially with their eyes, they never come across as anything other than puppets (the more cartoonish ""Toy Story"" characters did a better job of appearing life-like).The story is very mystical in nature, and since it obeys no rules and its ""revelations"" make no sense, you can't invest in it or be rewarded by it.Bottom-line: If you're a CG fan and must see it, rent it. If you're after an enjoyable movie with a decent story, skip it."
3,Historic but dull,"Having seen ""Tron"" when it played in theaters and now ""Final Fantasy"", I feel like someone who was a child when the Wright Brothers achieved flight and then lived to see the moon landing. There's no question that this is an historic milestone in film history. As such, it deserves viewing despite its well-documented shortcomings as a work of art.Not least among these is the disastrous voice-casting of Ming-Na (formerly Ming-Na Wen, but apparently graduated to single-name fabulousness - like Cher), an exceptionally inexpressive actress, as the heroine. No doubt Meryl Streep was unavailable but I can't believe that no one better could be found. Similarly, Alec Baldwin, a fine actor elsewhere (check out his powerful turn in ""Glengarry Glen Ross""), sounds audibly embarrassed to find himself here."
4,CGI supasses Walt Disney Productions this time around.,"Just a couple years ago, it was said that with the new computer effects, it would be possible to, for example, have a computer-digital Bruce Lee appear in a film (even though the actor died years ago) and look so realistic, you almost could not tell the difference. Well, the future is here! A CGI film has created a film totally by computer and the people do look realistic, you swear sometimes the people are actually human. They claim no photographs or scanners were used. With all due respect to Disney, this CGI film even supasses Walt Disney Productions. The plot really isn't that meaty and I felt no emotion towards the end. But I was surprised that the voices were of Alec Baldwin, Donald Sutherland, James Woods and Jean Simmons. Suggestion to the CGI Company: Make The Teeth Bright White!For a real CGI Science-Fiction experience, seeImmortal(2004)."
1,The End of the RPG Universe As We Know It!,"Three words, WORST FILM EVER! It doesn't take a moron to make a louisy film but it takes a special one to make one like this. The worst part is that the setting is in NEW YORK! Where's Spira or Midgar? It may sound weird but the animation pushes it so far that it almost looks real and without any true special effects. Yet another thing, every character is original and American. I want to see Sephiroth and Cloud go all-out on each other! The fights are boring, realistic shooting battles against pyrefly (FFX) rip-offs that feed on people's souls. I couldn't stand this movie and after just 20 minutes of viewing, I stopped watching it. Don't bother wasting money on this movie. Instead, buy something that has even just the least bit to do with Final Fantasy!"
4,This is a keeper,"OK so there are some problems with this movie in plot line, story and a disappointing ending, not to mention some bad (voice) acting. However I did enjoy the Gia story, I found it quite interesting as a philosophy. I write this review 8 years after the movie came out and it is still the reigning King of Computer Generated Graphic movies."
2,not for everyone,"after hearing so much good reviews upon this movie, finally bought it a week ago on blu ray. well, i am not a Final Fantasy's fan, this movie didn't do me any good, the blu ray format is so so. nothing to write home about. the story line, for me, so so too. will check out the [7th] soon."
2,needs a better script,"Ok if this was cartoon it would get 4 stars however, this flick tried to put itself in competition with a real movie by giving us these realistic textured effects therefore I am rating this as a sci fi movie. The special effects were unquestionably remarkable and the characters were one hair short of being viewed as real however, this movie suffered in giving us good suspense, drama, and diolague resulting in dull moments and a lack of excitement and anticipation. They need to perfect all those factors for a movie of this type to be considered a classic."
2,"Brilliant Animation, Lousy Script","I don't think the actors actually knew what they were talking about in this let down. It sounds as if they were just reading the script, not being able to inject personality into the animation. Still, this was a good idea, as the animation was incredible, the planets, landscapes and creatures all made it an enjoyable visionary experience. I am hopeful this will inspire similar style movies, just with better scripts."
3,My family enjoyed this movie,Truly amazing what can be done with computers. The plot kept me interested until the final ten minutes where it became it predictable.
2,AWFUL!,"i hated this movie! it was dull, and confusing. the graphics were exceptional, but it didn't make up for a poor plot line. IT looked really good in the beginning, but it turned out to be junk."
2,Tomb Raider is much better!,"One of the most dissapointing movies of this year, are 'Final Fantasy', the animation and the confusing story could have been done better, and something is missing in this 'from console to movie' event, that i thought should be the biggest computer animated movie of this year, don't waste money and time on this underrated movie, go for 'Tomb Raider' instead, even if this movie ain't 100% computer animated!"
2,Nothing new,"Well, OK. The animation is the saving grace of this film. Not much else is present, though. Bad character development, predictable plot, and a story that follows the Buddhist doctrine to a T-these are all reasons I find this movie under-par.The over-all crappiness can be attributed to the fact that square had it's thumbs in too many pies at the time of development (""pies"" like Final Fantasy IX-XI). Maybe that's why the movie came out second rate (FFIX, too!) In closing, it's worth seeing once for the CGI, but not a flick worthy of buying."
4,Good movie...better is on the way!!!,"This was a good movie! The CGI folk looked very real and sometimes I too forgot it was animated! Anyhoo...a lot of people don't understand why this is named ""Final Fantasy!"" But, they're stupid! Because, the real question would be...Why is FF2 named ""FF2"" when it has nothing to do with FF1!"" OR any other number...like 4..5..6-10...none of them have anything to do with each other, so just think of this as another game...same name...different people and story...and quit whining! And...X-2 is a sequel (And, it is NOT named ""12"") so that one deserves a number! Anyhoo...your prayers have been answered! The best game (FF7) is having a sequel (a movie) out in July! I suggest everyone purchase the game(15$) for PSone(50$) and get to playing before July rolls around! Subtitle is ""Advent Children"" Will be several times better than this movie!"
3,Not a bad DVD,"I am a big Final Fantasy fan, and I was very excited when I went to see the movie. The excitement didnt last to long however. This movie does have the best CGI graphics that I have seen. However I found the whole movie pretty darn boring, and even fell asleep a few times. The DVD does capture these images very well, and it has some nice extra's. I would not recommend this as a purchase, maybe a rental. The CGI is well worth seeing however."
1,It's not FF VII,"When I heard that they were making an FF movie I was so excited that I pooped myself. Then I found that it wouldn't be based on FF VII directly, so I pooped myself again, this time out of sorrow.Sure it's brilliant, but knowing that I could be watching the spiky headed, giant sword wielding Cloud star in this movie just destroyed it for me."
2,Fun!,"I watched this movie twice, once, I went to actually see the movie (on friends' initiative) at the cinema with some friends, about half way through we gave up on trying to watch it, so being that apparently we were the only ones who didnt get the new that this movie sucked, we ran around inside the unsupervised and otherwise unfilled movie theatre (yes, we were the ONLY ones)the second time was knowing that no one wud come and we just skipped the ""trying to follow"" bit."
3,stan larano,"it had holes in the screen the biggest was 6 inches in diameter,i neglected to ask for some patches or something,i have it open all the time for now.maybe the company can send me some mending kit???? it is faded in color too, no big deal....seems sturdy,survived a couple of storms already....let's see when the snow comes.Texsport Westview Screen Arbor"
3,Great Product for the Price,"The first attempt to put the tent up was not fun - but after the 3rd time it goes up very easy. It's easy to put up but a bit flimsy - the sides don't reach all the way down and bugs do get in but we take it camping with us and set up the spare tv in it and a cooler. It is so much better than sitting out in the sun - it's cooler and despite the fact that some bugs do get in, it makes sitting out in the evening much better - a couple of citronella candles help a lot."
5,Love it!,Love the taste!The only downside is that they package it in threes; can't just take one to ration or monitor self.
5,A Care Package Item for a Freshman College Student,"Our nephew loves these and when he left for college, I sent him these and he just loved the surprise. They arrived fresh, and well packaged."
5,Delicious and fast delivery!,I ordered these in time for christmas to give to people. They come in packs of three's so it was perfect. i tied a ribbon on top of each pack and gave them to old coworkers and some friends
3,Bela Didn't Do It!,"This entertaining murder mystery features Bela Lugosi in a typical red herring role. Shot at the low-budget Tiffany Studios, ""The Death Kiss"" (1933) is distinguished by the imaginative hand-tinted sequence in a projection room. A solid cast includes Bela's ""Dracula"" co-stars David Manners and Edward Van Sloan. Despite his limited screen time, one of Lugosi's better Poverty Row efforts."
1,"Terrible service, EXTREMELY slow shipping....yuck!","I paid for expedited shipping, but my order took forever! Communication with the company was unacceptable to say the least. At first I received only half of my shipping refund and had to complain to Amazon and BestPriceCenter to get the rest.There is NO way I would ever do business with this company again, and I would like to urge others to do likewise. This is not personal, just bad business practice."
1,It doesn't get much more rediculous!,"This movie could so easily have been a spoof comedy, but I think they were trying to be serious! My favorite part was when the terrorists just stroll up to the nuclear facility gate, and the security guard offers to take them inside with the tour group, but then they shoot him anyways! Then wandering around inside they run into the security supervisor, who answers all their questions about the tour group, and tells them to go join the group up on the roof, and then says: ""well, I've got to get going"" and he just walks away leaving the terrorists to just continue wandering around! What a security force! What a joke this movie is"
2,Appreciated far above its merits,"I was sorely disappointed with this supposed game studies classic. While charmingly written and enforced with good examples, it offers nothing really significant. The author's definition of games is overly convoluted and not just a bit tautological. He has severely misunderstood both Suits' and Wittgenstein's ideas and thus represents them in a way too negative light. And the titular concept of half-reality is mostly just a useful simplification for speaking to people who have not read semiotics or hermeneutical appropriation theory.If this is the first book on video game studies you read, it will look damn impressive. If, however, you are more versed in the field, and especially in the study of games and their like outside the video game perspective, it will look just misdirected, outdated and hopelessly shallow."
1,inaccurate description of the Catholic Inquisition,"After only perusing the book, I caught many inaccurate depictions of the Inquisition. The stories are the repeated tales of anti-Catholic propaganda and inaccurate unsubstantiated accounts that have permeated history and influenced researchers.If the author repeats such twisted stories, not sure I can trust his other interpretations of history. Too bad."
1,Don't bother!,"I was quite disappointed with this product. It came in a timely manner, but the condition it came in was terrible. The lenses were scratched up so badly that your vision will be impaired if you dare don these glasses! I know Superman had X-ray vision, but I didn't know Clark Kent was blind as a bat whenever he wore his glasses! The best you can do is to pop the lenses out and just use the frames. Then you'll be like the Clark Kent that George Reeves played on TV back in the day. :)"
1,The Stickup,their are only spanish subtitles; As I am 77 years old I needthe normal subtitles to be able to follow a movie on DVD
3,littrell,"I just watched this movie and I disagree with lala - I think the movie was well worth watching, it kept you guessing as to what was going to happen next and what really happned. I don't think it was oscar material - but worth seeing"
2,another movie,"another movie madewith no zeal or inspiration, just a bunch of druggies trying too make a buck,holloywood has lost its drive"
4,Not bad at all,"First, the bad news. This game can be extremely hard on the beginner, but practice the unit controls and camera movements, and it should get easier. Myth II is easier to navigate because you can use the mouse for camera movements.Now the good part. In almost every strategy game I've played, I had to worry about resources constantly. Myth doesn't have that problem. The tactical aspects of the game are amazing; if you hope to survive, you need to know exactly how to use each of your units. You can't rely on ""tank rush"" tactics like in traditional strategy games, because in most cases you are completely outnumbered. Finally, the music is just stunning, and I recommend you buy the soundtrack from Bungie Software. These games may frustrate the beginner, but the persistant gamer will find a lot to enjoy here."
1,IT IS A SOUNDTRACK,"Although Massive Attack is one of the greatest band of all times this is a soundtrack music ...so you need to see in order to understand the music ,the music itself is not that good ,songs of one or two minutes that goes nowhere without a story"
3,Over the top religious action mishmash,You need to love Jean Reno to be able to get through this over complicated French action thriller which deals with our man for all seasons Reno saving us from a German SS man's quest for a re-forming of religious structures hidden in clues deep in the fortified tunnels built along the borders of Germany and France before the Second World War. Early on the killing of people by hooded zealots using planted religious metaphors to link the crimes indicated something that may have proved ultimately more rewarding - but this was not to be.Great digital sound though!
3,Serial Killer Stalks Elite University,"Pierre Niemans (Jean Reno) is sent to the small village Guernon in the French Alps to investigate a murder where the killer has cut off the hands, cropped out the eyes, and strung up a body in fetal position 150 feet up on a cliff. Meanwhile, Max Kerkerian (Vincent Cassel) is checking up on a grave desecration where someone has opened a grave and painted a swastika on it. The two detectives converge with their separate cases and something untold is about to be revealed. Initially, Crimson Rivers reveals a very dark plot that crawls under the skin; however, the storyline loses ground as it is being revealed to the audience. At the end the audience is left with a story of flat feeling."
4,TERROR IN THE ALPS,"Director Mathieu Kassovitz whose movieLa Haine (Criterion Collection)has just entered the prestigious Criterion collection, co-wrote and directed THE CRIMSON RIVERS, based on Jean-Christophe Grangé'sBlood-Red Rivers, in 2000. Mathieu Kassovitz, like Luc Besson and a few others, belongs to this new generation of French directors who try to deliver films shot ""à la Hollywood"" without losing their particular and local specificities.I liked a lot the first half-hour of THE CRIMSON RIVERS with its tragic and heavy mood and its flamboyant direction but I am a little less convinced by the second half of the film as soon as it becomes a buddy movie in the LETHAL WEAPON style. Too many references or hommages to American films, too many easy jokes and sometimes almost laughable dialogues. But, all in all, THE CRIMSON RIVERS is a movie I sincerely recommend to those of you who aren't satisfied any more with the actual Hollywood production.A DVD zone it's French but it's not boring."
3,Ultimately Nonsensical,"This is a well-produced film, however it's not a very well-written film. The plot makes sense only as long as you don't actually think about it. But Jean Reno and Vincent Cassel both turn in likeable, interesting performances and the suspense is fairly well-maintained. A fine Saturday afternoon matinee..."
3,A very average read,"Like many reviewers I have read and enjoyed mr.Margolins earlier books and am a little surpirsed with this one. The plot is OK, if somewhat simple. It does not take too long to figure out the main culprits, but the issues raised are interesting. What I find puzzling is that the book reads like it has been written in two weeks and somehow bypassed a good editor. Some parts of the story are far too long (like the development of the marriage between Laura and Quinn or the early court room scenes) and others are an insult to the readers intelligence, like not sharing the findings of the M.E.officer with the reader. What annoyed me finally was one of the recommendations on the paperback cover claiming that ""the book reminds me in many ways of IN COLD BLOOD but in a way it is even better"". That is bullocks and the publisher should know that."
3,How dumb can a judge be?,The courtroom dialog is quite accurate- but I never met a judge that naive - of course he was a contract lawyer before coming on the bench. Robert traver where are you?
4,Quick and Suspenseful,"I flew through this book after having read a few slow and dull novels. This was very entertaining and fast paced and even though I felt I knew ""whodunnit"" from the beginning (I did), there were lots of twists and turns that created doubts. On the down side, a few portions (such as the St. Jerome interlude) seemed too drawn out and at times I was annoyed at Quinn's naivte about being set up, etc. But all in all I found this a good tale and will probably read other books by this author."
4,This book keeps you guessing! The end is a total surprise!,"I finished the book in one day. I just couldn't put it down! The characters are well written with no one being too ""saintly"". Just when I thought I had it figured out, another twist kept me second guessing myself. I thought the moral delimmas were well done and not too outlandish, something we can all probably relate to at some time in our life. If you enjoyed his other books this one won't disappoint."
4,"Enjoyable, But Not His Best","Margolin's latest is a fast-paced, entertaining, but somewhat predictable, thriller. If this is your first book by Phillip Margolin, you'll probably like it a lot and look to read other books by him. If, however, you've read most or all of Margolin's previous works, as I have, you'll likely consider it to be not one of his best."
3,Ho Hum Court TV Drama,"I read ""The Undertaker's Widow"" in 2 days and figured out the mystery, i.e. who was responsible for the murders of Hoyt and the intruder, in the first 100 pages. Please!!! This is a ho hum the way ""The Firm"" was (and it didn't help to have Tom Cruise star in the motion picture same name, still booorrrrriiiiiinnnnnnngggggg!!! Too much time spent in court. I normally put any book down before I buy it or read it that features some attorney and his client or his own legal problems. (I'm from Portland and that didn't even keep me awake from this snoozer.) Who are these people who just couldn't put it down??????"
3,Something's wrong somewhere,"As a fan if not necessarily a connoisseur of Sichuan food, as eaten in Sichuan and in the Sichuan community in Shenzhen next to Hong Kong where I live, I bought this book in the hope of being able to create some of my favourite dishes at home. But despite being a reasonably accomplished cook, in Chinese and Western cuisines, I have not yet, using her recipes, been able to create one dish that tastes remotely like the real thing. And a Sichuanese niece-in-law, looking at some of the ingredients and methods, laughed her head off. Like I said, something wrong somewhere. Never mind, three stars because its a nice book with nice pictures and the text, apart from the recipes, is readable and quite informative. Should I try her book on Hunanese cooking, another regional cuisine I'm rather fond of? Perhaps not. I also have a Hunanese niece-in-law."
5,Truly Amazing... Truly Authentic,"So far this is the BEST cookbook I've seen on Sichuan Cuisine. The author does an incredible job with the research on both the recipes and even the histories of the dishes and factoids on Sichuan cuisine. If I could wish for an improvement, it would be for more pictures. But trust me, that is not a reason to detract from the excellence of this book. If you are looking for an authentic Sichuan Chinese cookbook, this is as close as it gets."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"I recently purchased this product and I am very disappointed. Everything negative that they say is not true of this product, is actually true. It leaves a flaky tacky looking mess in your hair. It looks like you have really bad dandruff.I regret buying it, because the place where I purchased it will not accept returns on these kinds of items. Do yourself a favor and spend your money on something else."
1,You get what you pay for,"Nothing but trouble in the long run. Anemometer replaced twice under warranty. Now broken again just as the storms build up. Sending unit no longer sends temp/humidity, even with new batts."
1,Save your money!!!,"I have had the unit for about 3yrs. rain guage was repaired once. Didn't work one more year. Just had a storm with 50 mile an hour winds. I watched the wind guage, it showed 18 miles an hour. Need I say more!!"
4,Watcher in the Woods,"This movie has suspense and is so good ! I like it very much and would recommend it to everyone. It is clean entertainment and holds your attention. It won't scare you to death, but it will keep you watching non-stop."
5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE,"I saw Watcher in the Woods when I was little. Now at 23 I saw it again last night. It is so scary, I wanted to sleep on the floor in my parents room. It is nothing like a Disney movie I have nave no clue why it is rated G or PG. I would never let any small kids see this movie. If you are older and want to see a really scary movie go out and get this one."
4,Atmospheric Disney Effort,"Forget Midnight Madness and The Devil and Max Devlin. Disney's main foray into more adult features (aside from the GREAT Night Crossing) is ""Watcher in the Woods."" Hopefully, this Anchor Bay Release will deliver the goods they've promised (the original ending). The film is BEAUTIFULLY shot, and certainly atmospheric. And it features a pre-stroke Bette Davis in one of her last potent film roles. Poor Lynn Holly Johnston (Ice Castles) suffers the most, as the re-shoots during post-production really show her age difference. Still, I'm anxious to see this film again..."
4,Great movie...Great performance,I really enjoyed this movie. One of the best romantic comedies I've ever seen. Reese Witherspoon gave a great performance.
3,"Sweet, Silly and Sexy","A romantic screwball comedy that hits all the classic areas, but does it with style and flair, and just enough offbeat attitude (until I read the Amazon review I didn't know Kevin Smith wrote the original script, but there are still plenty of traces in the finished product) to make it well worth seeing. Paul Rudd and Reese Witherspoon have genuine chemistry, and Reese has never been more adorable. Would have gotten another 1/2 star if not for the no-frills package, but does contain both widescreen and pan-and-scan versions."
2,Stretch at Your Own Risk,"After seeing how highly rated this video was here, I decided to see for myself. So I went out and bought it. Well, I must say, I had a totally different experience: I didn't like it very much! Though I found the instructor Kim Haegele to be very friendly and clear in her directions, I did think that she could've been even more so. Because this was allegedly aimed at beginner's, I think it would've been far more helpful to have someone else besides the instructor demonstrating the modified poses, as opposed to just occasionally flashing them on the screen and hoping that we'll remember them! Needless to say, by the end of the tape, I felt more nauseous and confused than relaxed. For a tape that is truly accessible to the beginning student, I recommend Crunch's Fat Burning Yoga as an alternative."
3,The Not Quite Right Path,"The Right Path tells you the tale of Morgan James, who is visits her friend in Greece while on vacation, and Nicholas Gregoras, a secretive man that lives there. While this is a okay story, it is far from Nora Roberts best. I found the characters lacking, they seemed to be two-dimensional to me, more Nicholas than Morgan but not by much. At times I found my attention wandering from the book and had to get my focus back in on it, usually N.R.'s books' keep me riveted page by page. I think the main thing was that you didn't see how they fell in love, what made them love each other. You could see they had passion, but you didn't really get to know them all that much. The plot was good and it worked out nicely, I just wish there had better main characters, or at least they weren't so flat."
4,Great foundation for film students,"This book reads as a bit dated, but the foundations you learn from it are terrific. I used this as a textbook in a film production class and learned quite a lot. We were assigned certain chapters but I read the whole book on my own because I learned so much from it. If you're new to film and media production definitely pick up this book. I still keep it on my shelf and reference it every once in a while."
4,WM - 1941 to Chessie to CSXT Diesel ERA,"Well researched book including numerous B&W (75%) and color (25%) pics of WM diesels throughout the diesel era at WM and afterwards. The back cover is more beautiful than the front cover. I keep a copy as part of my Western Maryland Railway (& Railroad) collection. Includes WM diesel roster with Chessie and CSXT renumbering, ALCOs, Baldwins, EMDs, GEs and homebuilts, route maps and more. ISBN 1-883089-24-7"
1,it's corny all they try to be like is TLC.,i don't like it. every time someone come out talking about something like TLC did guys didn't like that so to be on the defensive side some guys had to come out dissin females. Guys can't stand hearing the truth and just let it be. The song maybe selling but I guaranteed we won't hear nothing else from this group. ONE-HIT WONDERS.
5,PIGEONS IS OFF THE HESEY!!,PIGEONS IS THE COME BACK SONG TO NO SCRUBS. I MEAN I KNOW MAD SCRUBS BUT I KNOW TOO MANY PIGEONS. THIS SONG GOES OU TO ALL THE PIGEONS IN THE WORLD. YALL KNOW WHO YALL ARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,I despise this game!!!,"This game is horrible! I have seen game demos longer than this game. I beat it the day after I got it. It has a totally pointless goal, where you are supposed to take pictures of the pokemon. When will the people at Nintendo stop being stupid and learn that if they stick to the material, such as the gameboy games, then there games would not be selling for 20 bucks right now. My only regrets(besides buying this game) is that you have to put one star up there. This gamedeserves zero. please, do yourself a favor and rent this game before you buy it."
1,BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!,"What are you looking for in a game? Are you looking for action, adventure, learning, or boring hours of repeated gameplay? If you are looking for the fourth choice, you definantly found it. I could give myself more entertainment with watching Barney. Seriously, unless you are looking for endless hours of taking pictures of little (...) creatures jumping around on the screen, Don't Get This."
1,boo!,"If I could pick the most boring, esiest game in the world,I would pick this one. All you do is z+a=a picture. Throughout the levels you get things like bait and stuff, but unless your a serous camera fan, this game should be reccomended to no one."
4,fun for young players,"Pokemon Snap was an eye-opener - finally! a fun game for me and my 6yo son. Neither of us have much experience with video games (do the Lost Years spent playing Tetris for Macintosh count? :) This was our first time using the Nintendo joystick, and we both had some trouble mastering the controls. Listening and watching for Pokemon characters while snapping a photo while panning the camera while the car is moving... you get the idea.Once you master the camera, the game is fun and challenging - to a point. There are a few quirks - for example, the presentation of the character ""Professor Oak"" has some glaring flaws. (He has a lot of lines to deliver, but only the first line in each scene is spoken. If the player is below reading age this could be very frustrating.)I agree with other reviewers, the game doesn't have legs. I can't imagine playing more than a few times. Nonetheless it's a great game for younger players./kmc"
1,Pointless and Endless,This game is the worst game I've ever played with! It was dumb and boring. You just take pictures of Pokemon and that is not a challenge.The other games like Pokemon Yellow and Blue are much better.i suggest those games.
1,Don't Get this game..,"Don't get this game. It is not worth the money. Ok.. you can print the picture out but then you have to buy the pokemon snap card and it costs about $5 and it is just not worth the money. And it is to short. No plot, no challange, might as well go through your photo album, it would be more entertaining"
4,"good, clean fun","If parents are having trouble finding a violent-free game for their little kids, they'll fall in love with this game. This game is not simple though, because when you take pictures, you get scored for them, this depends on the angle, the pose, etc. Once you get enough points, you can go onto the next stage. Another thing that occasionally happens when you get enough points is you'll get new items to attract the pokemon, you can get better shots this way. This game is easy to learn, but hard to master. This is a definite buy for little kids, but anyone over ten might just want to rent it. If you play your cards..er...cameras right, you might find Mew..."
2,this is not one of the best games i have ever played,at first this game is alot of fun but then it starts to get boring I have beat the game and id say once you get used to it you coan beat i n about hmmmmmm about 8-10 hours
5,Fun for everyone!,"My little four year old niece owns this game. Every time she comes over, the adults take it over! I caught myself playing once for over four hours. To begin with Pokemon are incredibly cute, and it is nice that this game does not focus on the trained Pokemon doing battle with each other but rather on the wild Pokemon playing in their ""natural"" habitats. The whole concept of taking pictures of Pokemon and then having these pictures scored by ""Dr. Oak"" is not only great for young children but gratifying for adults as well. And since you can increase the difficulty, the game really increases your hand-eye coordination without the use of violence (a major plus). And you can't forget the bonus of turning your favorite snap shots into stickers at the video store. You can bet ""Pokemon Snap"" is on MY Christmas list!"
1,"""When they mess with the best.""","Lindt's original recipe was the gold standard of dark chocolate. Mother Temptation's favorite child. But what is success in today's world if it can be exchanged for failure? And failure itself is the success of this new recipe. Lindt soyed the taste to where the experience of flavor is completely overtaken with the question of: ""What have I just eaten?"" Remember the world in the movie Soylent Green? This is the chocolate for them."
1,Dreadful,"The new formula 70% Lindt chocolate bar is terrible. Nothing at all like the old formula which was one of my favorites. I wrote to Lindt about this and they responded that marketing research found more people preferred the taste of the new formula bar.I wonder if they used the same company that recommended ""new coke"", that British Airways change their tail design, and that Citibank start issuing their PDF statements on 7x14 paper size!Yes, the average American prefers a Hershey bar to most other chocolate, no surprise there. It's what we grew up with. But they're not going to pay $2 for one in a fancy dancy euro-style package."
1,wrong product,"They will send you 70% cocoa lindt chocolate but it has a ""new recipe"". It's 30 calories more a serving, all sugar, and takes like crappy milk chocolate you'd get in a cheap easter bunny. Has none of the cocoa bite that it used to. This is kind of sad, since this chocolate used to be the best readily available dark chocolate on the market.If you're looking for a dark chocolate that's kind of low in carbs, this isn't it. Save yourself some money and buy a hersey bar."
2,Vanilla Cream,"This review is only for the Natural Vanilla Cream flavor. Get the regular vanilla, tastes much better and is a great product. I bought this, figuring it is natural and would be a healthier alternative but ended up throwing out the entire container due to the terrible smell. Curdled milk with cottage cheese would be a good description of the flavor."
3,Tastes great and helps me recover from workout quicker,"I just started taking this, not as recommended, but one serving after my workout. I take all things in moderation. But i have noticed a quicker recovery from after my workouts then from taking nothing at all. I don't really have anything to compare it to but it tastes great and works quick."
3,Not the best strawberry flavor,"This product has the original fat content, and does not use aspartame for sweetening. It's good if this is suitable for you. However it does not taste as good to me as the strawberries & creme. Also the strawberries & creme has the new lower fat formula."
1,Nasty,"The ""Fresh Strawberry"" flavor was so bad I washed my mouth out after drinking it.However, the vanilla is good and the chocolate is especially good."
4,Nice flavor and all natural,"It has a nice flavor but doesn't get as thick as the ""non-natural"" muscle milk. I like the chocolate flavor as its not too sweet."
3,It's delicious. But results are just ok,"I order this first, because I ran out of Syntha-6 and second because it's all natural (per say). It's a little too sweet at first because of Stevia but you'll end up liking it.Okay I start taking this after workout and felt fine first week. but now been taking this for last 3 weeks i've lost some mass. Not same results as syntha, but it ok product."
3,I prefer peanut butter chocolate,"I love the muscle milk line of products, but I found the flavor and taste of their regular chocolate lacking. I have only thus far mixed it with water, so I'm assuming it would taste much better with milk. However, I've only ever tried this flavor and peanut butter chocolate, and far and away the peanut butter chocolate is much better.If I order this product again, I'm definitely going back to peanut butter chocolate!!"
2,Muscle milk NATURALS- sweeter taste,Ive been using the muscle milk powder- chocolate flavor for sometime now but they were out of the 'regular' one so i bought 'naturals' same flavor- I hate really sweet things and the naturals version of the product is significantly sweeter than the original. If you do not like sweet stuff- the naturals line is not for you. I could not even get one drink down :(
4,"Sags in the middle, and then picks up!","We really liked the first season of Supernatural because of its original theme (we love watching scary movies and shows) and because the repartee between the two stars gets to be funny sometimes. Not to mention the fact that both stars are quite hunky. This second season has the same type of stories as the first season, however we found that the writing was a little too soft at the beginning and in the middle of the season, between the 3rd and the 10th episodes. We were actually considering not to buy the next season when it goes on sale, however, as we watched the last 12 episodes of this season we were hooked again. Now we're really looking forward to see the 3rd Season."
5,Supernatural-The Complete Second Season,"Supernatural - The Complete Second SeasonI have been a Supernatural fan since the beginning of the series and have been interested in the supernatural since I was a child. The mythology and lore in this season is very well written. I particularly liked the episode ""Tall Tales"" which featured a trickster. The special features in this set add to the overall experience of the series."
5,what I wanted but the amazon player sucks,exactly what I wanted to see but I had to download the video and the downloading took all night before I could watch the show.
2,Boring,"I am trying so hard to like this show. The actors are good, but the writing is predictable with silly dialogue. The concept is a good one; I just wish there were more momentum and better lines for these poor actors to deliver."
5,Best series ever!,"This show never disappoints, one of my favorite series ever! Very intriguing storyline, always something interesting & different to look forward to. I love Sam & Dean!!!"
3,Supernaturual 3rd Season,Love the series can't wait to get season 3 if it ever ships! However its marked new never opened in the description yet 2 of the disks have smudges and 1 had a bad scratch that required taking to have repaired to be viewable.
2,Back when it was the WB,"This show just took over the spot Buffy the Vampire slayer left behind, most fans did not want Buffy to end, so a few years later comes a show about two guys hunting demons, monsters etc, Hmmm sounds like the scooby gang to me, only extra-testosterone added. I'll give it this much, they do use some nice cars."
1,the bestseries on tv,well here it is for those with brains and like violence and good acting you should buy it !great series!
5,SUPERnatural,I already had the first season so I HAD to get the second one. This is just a really fantastic and unique series. Any one not watching is really missing out!
2,Alien meets Predator meets Jurassic Park in Borneo,"This movie had potential.. but blew it quickly. The filming itself was good... as was the background music. The acting not bad. But the plot!!! Once it began unraveling it was very very clear they borrowed heavily from Alien, Predator and Jurassic park. To the point where some actual scenes were recreated such as the scene in aliens where the little girls hands come up through a grate. The scene in jurassic park before the mayhem when they're in the computer room and Samuel Jackson has a cigarette in his mouth while he tries to save the system is another.The Special Effects for the monster were mixed. When it was CGI it was terrible, when it was a costume it fit.If you have time to waste... this is wastable. Otherwise, don't go out of your way to find this one. It doesn't even fit in the 'B' category."
4,"Good, but not as good as Ricky Schroeder's version",I would love to find Ricky Shroeder's Version of this classic. If anyone out there knows where to get it - please let me know!!!
2,Overrated,"I bought this on a whim when I saw it in the bargain bin at the local store. Angry Cockroaches, the one song I remember from the movie ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is still awesome, but the rest of the album is generic mid 90's schlock.If you like the type of music played in ""From Dustk Till Dawn"" check out a group called Ch*ngon instead (and yes, that is a swear word in Spanish). They did some of the music in Planet Terror and the Kill Bill films, and it's much better than this."
3,for ZZ Top fans - Good southern rock with a taste of latino.,"first heard in the Tarantino flick ""from dusk till dawn"" great pieces of rock with a glimpse of latino sound. for ZZ top fans"
1,Junk,Will amplify noise only about 1 feet away from it. Totally useless. Looks and Feels like a toy.
3,Not satisfied with the delivery time,"They charged me $10 for two day delivery, but it did not arrive in 2 days as promised , so i am not happy for over priced shipping."
4,Good book but short,"I would say get this as an accompaniment to the best home based businesses, I dont see the difference between the part time jobs she lists here and her full time jobs in the other books, but maybe you will. A good book but shorter than the others"
2,makes odd shaped bones,"This cutter duo makes an odd shaped bone and makes it look like they were stretched in an odd way, kind of lopsided. there is writing but it's hard to get it to show up on the bone...never using it again. :("
1,"Bad battery, Very disappointed",The Lenmar cell battery lasted two weeks then it stopped recharging. the battery just gave up. It was a waste of money
1,Doesn't work at all,"Purchased this item even though it was more expensive than some others offered because it said it was specifically for the Motorazr v3m, which I own...cannot get it to work at all, every time I have tried I get an ""invalid battery"" message on my phone."
4,It was decent,"This book was good, but it was a bit hectic, as one of the previous reviewers mentioned. Alcoholism was the only problem that I felt like was addressed in any depth, but being at a point in my life where many of my friends are starting to drink it was good to see how Christians can help those that face this struggle. It was also a good reminder that drinking is a temptation like any other temptation, gambling, guys, lying, etc, and that we do all need each other and God to help us be free from those temptations. This book was definitely meant for a younger crowd, maybe junior high or early high school, but still had a message that spoke to me as a college student."
4,Do you know someone from England??!! Prepare yourself!!!!,"I'm taking a trip to England in a couple weeks and I was going through the travel section where they have the travel guides and I came across this book and I thumbed through it...And since I correspond with people in England it was very interesting to me...and as reading it I found myself smiling cause of some of the things mentioned were true, and I couldn't help but buy it and read it completely. Despite the fact that I found it focusing on the negative aspects, I think that that is to prepare you for some facts that you will find true in the English...(The good side will always cheer us, and the person I deal with is full of beauty and life, but the bad I rather not be surprised with). Overall a great insite to the mentality in a comical way."
2,Tarnished,"I bought the key ring for a Betty Boop fan, but when it came, I changed my mind on giving it. The metal ring itself was extremely tarnished and even though I know I had just purchased it, it looks too old and used to give as a gift. One day, maybe i'll use it myself. I give it 2 stars because Betty herself is fine, but it's purposeless and just another item in my junk drawer until i decide to use it. Not really worth the gas money and time to return it."
3,Helped me feel better about myself,"It's easy to see why this book has sold over a million copies. The images are so appealing--honest and funny. I laughed out loud at the page ""Breasts like women come in all shapes and sizes."" That page illustration helped me feel better about myself. Girls often stare at me when I'm at the gym. So I smile and say, ""Breasts, like women come in all shapes and sizes."" This book introduce preteens to puberty and, it's a great companion book forFlowering Woman Moontime for Kory, A Menarche Adventure & Rite of Passage Story"
2,Good intent,As sad a book as it is it is also inspiring. I enjoyed the characters and did not feel the need to put it down however I was quite disappointed as it seemed the story just jumped over a very big part of Sofies story to suddenly end when least expected
5,"Ah, the Nostalgia","The game itself is exactly what I expected, all the bits coming back in memory and fun. The pokedex is still relatively empty, so I am able to continue a great deal on my own. The controls take a bit of tweaking, and the rumble pack may be optional (I choose not to use it due to shaking the old gameboy's components) but it can add a great deal of appeal.A word of warning: When I received mine, the battery cover was stiff, and took a bit to get off. I also noticed one of the prongs of plastic to clip it in had been broken off before receiving it. One was still on, so the cover still fits snugly, however I stress the need to be careful when adding or removing the rumble pack batteries, especially if you still have a fitting cover.A true gentleman plays on the blue field."
2,"Not a Nutrition or Diet Book, Simply an analysis.","Well written, well researched, but not what it purports to be, nor what many consumers think they are buying. This book is simply an endoresement of Barry Sears ""The Zone"" diet, which the auther himself wholeheartedly supports. He even confirms that The Zone is how he lost and maintains his weight. If you want a book that does no more than describe why The Zone works, buy this one. But if you want a plan to meet your goals, look elsewhere."
5,Topnotch studio album,"In many ways this is their best studio album. You've read here and there of the Russian influence to their music. This album exemplifies that most clearly and lent an added dimension of power to such songs as ""Running Hard"" and ""Mother Russia."" As a result the entire album hits harder than any of their other releases, yet never loses touch with all the other elements that contributed to this band's greatness. Recommended most highly.James Buffington, authorPolitically Incorrect Liberal Obama Jokes: Funny Liberal Bashing Done in Good Humor; Barack Obama Jokes, Congress, Rev. Wright, & Democrats"
3,Mixed deck,"Mildly powerful progressive melodics keep the album perched nicely between mechanized and pertinent, not exactly a fierce poker hand."
4,One of a kind Sound,"Possibly Renaissance's very best effort. Includes Renaissance's best song ""Things I Don't Understand."" This lesser known song has all the trademarks i.e. the heavy,heavy Richenbacher bass, Annie Haslam's voice of an angel vocals plus Jon Tout's prodigious piano playing. Jon really pounds the keys on this one! The song is written in the minor key like so many but up tempo for a refreshng change. Also included is the more well known ""Mother Russia."" A really fine ballad but not quite as good as the live version."
4,Well-done dictionary,"For any student of the Ilocano language, a comprehensive dictionary such as this is needed. This dictionary has many entries and very easy to look for the English meaning in Ilocano and vice-versa. However, I think that this dictionary should be a bit modernized."
3,Gold binding post Pair,"A second SMALL NUT AND 2 SMALL ACCOMPANYING WASHERS to ensure good tight connections at the small end.Knobs look to weak to tighten firmly,"
3,Breath Exerciser,"I k now this is designed to be sports equipment. I tried for myself as a lung strengthener as I have COPD, Stage III. It did not really work right for me. That is not to say that it might not work for another lung disease sufferer. It is a good product. Though once I opened the package I was surprised it was so expensive, Its just plastic with a ball in it."
1,Horrible chemical taste and smell,Do not waste your time. The chemical smell and taste of the mouthpiece is enough to make you vomit! I tried numerous ways to remove the smell and taste but nothing worked.
5,Breathing Exerciser,I had heard about this method of exercising the lungs and have to say I am very impressed with the simplicity and yet the exceptional results in ony a few days. Amazing.Since we receive about 90% of our energy from oxygen this is much more valuable to humans than most would believe.Thanks
1,"Horrible stench, vile taste",The plastic stinks so bad that I do not dare expose myself to whatever toxic noxious chemicals were used to manufacture it. I tried running it through the dishwasher but the stink did not dissipate. It was manufactured in China so minimal quality control. Do not buy this product. It is unsafe and unusable.
3,"Important historical document, but for Bach look elsewhere","No doubt we have to thank Casals for resurrecting the solo Cello Suites in the XXth Century, but we have come a long way in understanding Bach and the XVIII Century since the 1930's. I would recommend everyone Pieter Wispelwey exciting new recording in Channel Classics as a first choice, but there is also Anner Bylsma in SONY and Jaap ter Linden in Harmonia Mundi, all these cellist can take you to Bach's sound world, and will show you why Bach is SO important."
1,Teena Marie has nothing to worry about,"Nikka Costa been given way too much hype.She has some Grooves,but Vocallly&Lyriclaly She is very generic.alot of watered down grooves that show just show how just kinda there this Chick's music truly is.without Her Pops&Connections she would be washing Dishes at Dennys.she is alright Live,but the Problem is that on Record she seems to Generic&Contrived.Lady T would Eat Her Musicially for Breakfast,Lunch,Dinner&After Midnight snack.Nikka Costa is more hype than Substance."
5,"One of the best albums of the year, period","Forget mistermaxxx's review. Teena Marie is not someone Nikka Costa is trying to be, she has always been her own artist and it shows in this album, featuring a wide range of styles that a lot of artists I feel are lacking these days. If you want heartfelt, it's here. There's passion, there's pain, and if you want rock, you got some of it here. I for one to not feel she is trying or struggling to be someone else, for she is herself and you can hear it here."
3,Ceasar 3,"When I found this on the internet I immediatly bought it. It looked very exciting. Buy when I found out the real parts of the game, I kind of felt like I wasted my money. The good part is the improvement Sierra made with the Empire/City/Battlefield maps. The bad part is you can never have your people happy with the Employment. Unlike Ceasar 2, you have to watch out for unnemployment and not enough workers. Once I was building a big city with large houses and when they turned into villas, the population went down by 200, and I couldn't bring it back up because I didn't have enough workers to power the appliances the houses needed (like fountains and markets). And that ruined my whole city. I wouldn't recommend this product to any people who hate wasting their time building and only to people who are extreme city builders."
1,Tough,Maybe I'm impaitient. This game just takes way too much time to learn. I played a couple times without reading the manual. No goThe manual is about 60 pages. I would not recommend this game.
1,Caesar 3,I don't know how much fun the game is or how I would rate it simply because the CD does NOT work. Even though I tried several times the game will not load to my computer. I am very dissapointed.
4,Totally engrossing and entertaining!!,"Sorry mom, I can't do the dishes; I have to plan a festival to Venus and then send a troupe of slaves to the Emperor!This game was fantastic. There were a couple errors (like Neptune being referred to as Jupiter and small things such as that) but I completely ignored them because the game was so much fun. It's like sim city but people push carts instead of driving cars and you have to worry about appeasing the gods rather than robot invasions. Trading with other cities is fun and sometimes challenging, as is building up a military or sending gifts to the Emperor to increase your favour rating. Just don't get in the red too often or he'll arrest you!!Overall I think this game is better than Sim City. The actions you can take regarding the military, gods, dealing with Rome and dealing with all the other diverse facets of building up a roman city make it a great game and tons of fun. I recommend this for anyone who likes building or sim games!"
4,Great! Cool! and Addictive,i never thought i would like a sim game. Butt the the roman setting makes it really cool. I play this game for hours and never get bored. My only concern for the game is that there are many glitches to run into. For instance a guy standing on a plaza and doing the moon walk. Also i had some problems geting goods from warehouses to markets. It took me a while to figure that one out. Overall i think that this a pretty good game. It starts out easy then it gets hard. While playing this game make sure that the gods are happy. hint!hint!
1,Good Product,"This product is excellent! Definitely a must for good health. I used it and I am very happy with it.At any local Indian store, YOU CAN BUY THE SAME EXACT BOTTLE(2.2LB) FOR $8.99. This seller is way too expensive."
5,Fantastic Game!!,"Great game- highly recommended to anyone looking for along, rich game. Cool enemies, weapons, game-play, andreally never anything more than moderately hard. The bossbattles take some getting used to, but there are patterns to work with there, too. This is just a COOL game, with a lotof variety and depth!!"
4,It's Awesome!,"This Game is great! It has great graphics, and has an awesome story to it! This could be the best game for N64 yet! If you like games with action, you should definitely, I mean definitely, get this!"
3,Impressive but uncomfortable,"At 2 lbs in weight and mounted on the front of your face, you have to strap the goggles on pretty tight so that they don't hang down. This makes them uncomfortable to wear for any length of time. It would be preferable if they were mounted on a rigid head piece like a bike helmet with a counter weight at the back for balance.As for night vision capability, they are very impressive and very sensitive, but beware of using them anywhere there are artifical lights, you might end up causing permanent damage to them. Definitely best used in complete darkness."
4,"A bit older model, not latest generation, but still ok.","This is an older, Russian-Made version of the US Military version. It is higher quality first generation night vision, but lacks the clarity of the new 2nd and 3rd generation units, but for it's price, is NOT a bad deal at all. For 3rd generation, be prepared to fork out 10 times this price.I also suggest placing a piece of black electrical tape or something similar over the ir source since it is red and can be seen for some distance, and get the ramsey kit IR-1 which can be found here on Amazon. It requires a small 12 volt source, but be creative, I use one of those fanypack 12 volt kits that will power the IR-1 for a long time, and used 2-way adhesive squares to attach it to the IR Goggles frame. It is like having a huge invisible (to the naked eye), spotlight, and increases the range and visibility over 100 times than the internal visible light source.Hope this helps.WalterUS Dept. of Homeland Security"
5,I am motivated,Very motivational book. Gives the reader a different perspective outside of the self. Reminds all what's really unimportant and to trust in God.
5,My New #1 Best Book on Spiritual Leadership,"Rarely do I read a book cover to cover. This one I read twice, highlighter in hand, enthusiastically marking quotes and making notes in the margin. Besides being well-written and easy-to-read, I was encouraged and inspired by story after story of Billy Graham's passion for God, his obedience in the face of adversity, and his personal accomplishments for which he continues to be amazed. I love how Myra and Shelley then took each chapter topic and suggested ways for the rest of us to apply the principles to our own roles as leaders. This book has now moved into the position of my #1 spiritual leadership book. I will refer to over and over again and highly recommend it to others."
2,Not much of a horror movie...,"I just received this DVD as a gift for Christmas, and from the looks of the cover image(s), my girlfriend and I were definitely looking forward to watching it. Wow, was I ever dissapointed. Don't get me wrong...it isn't a waste of time to watch this movie, it's just not what I was led to expect. For one, the beast on the cover looks pretty damn cool...well, it's not. In the movie it's pretty lame. As a comedy, this movie wasn't all that bad. It was definitely the comedic moments that kept this movie alive for me, as it definitely wasn't scary at all. This is a good one to rent if you feel you've seen everything in the video store, and you're willing to watch this with an open mind. Oh, yeah...do you believe in the power of the human soul? (Whatever that is supposed to mean... it's said about 10 times throughout the movie)"
3,Don't Blink!...,"Well, I admit it. I bought SOULKEEPER in order to see the wondrously hideous demonoid on the DVD cover. As a huge monster fanatic, I thought I'd arrived in critter nirvana! Alas, my hopes were dashed, as the aforementioned beastie only got about 4 seconds of total screen time! Ugh! As for the movie itself, it sort of reminded me of an aborted, half-baked TALES FROM THE CRYPT movie. It had some blood, boobs, and a few instances of humour. Unfortunately, it came off as goofy and half-hearted as well. On the up side, it's always fun to see Brad Dourif and Karen Black in (almost) anything! Though I don't regret watching it, I can't imagine doing so again any time soon..."
5,Boy Meets World,"I watch a lot of different shows but Boy Meets World is on of the best. Even though I like the seasons when Cory, Shawn, and Topanga are older in collage the first season is really funny too."
5,A great start to a great series!,"Anyone who remembers TGIF remembers this show. Overall it was great, from the beginning to the end, and the first season does not disappoint!"
5,Boy meets world,Bought this for my middle school aged daughter and she really likes it. Even though series was made about 20 years ago the topics are still the same things she goes through today.
5,If you like this I have something better!!!,I love Boy Meets World just like everybody else and if you want the whole series they have it all in one set on ebay. I know i'm kind of a traitor to amazon but i cant keep this info to myself because it is just too good!!!
5,Lovin it!!!!!!!!!,i LOVE BMW IT IS THE BEST SHOW EVER THAT MAKES THIS THE BEST DVD EVAIT ROCKS!!!!!! LOLIT IS WELL WORTH THE PRICE I CANT WAIT TILL I GET ALL THE SEASONS ON DVD THAT WOULD BE SOOOOOOOOOO AWSOMEI'M LOVIN THIS~kira~
5,BOY MEETS WORLD,"If you are a fan of BMW, then the wait is over. The DVD of the first season has finally been released, and it was well worth the wait. Every episode of the first season, shown just as you would remember them. The extra's are slightly skimped(the only extra offered is commentary throughout one episode-Cory's Alternative Friends-but that one extra is very funny)It is priced a bit high, but I assure you that it is worth every penny! Can't wait for the next six seasons!!"
3,Works but Cheap Construction,"This is the only device of this type that I have ever owned; so, I can'r compare this to any other product. It does what it needs to do, but the construction is poor. From the start, it has been a battle to keep the battery cover in place. It is almost entirely made up of cheap plastic; and, I do not expect it to last more than a year, if that long."
4,Great show,This is s great show. I only wish I'd seen it when it orinally aired. I can't wait to finish watching it.
4,Good DVD's,Interesting movie about Roswell Alien's. Even though the characters are not extremely strong... they are very easily to be attached to. The plot is good and the characters are nice looking young people. The story keeps you interested defintely and makes you want to watch the next episode! Defintely worth your money if you are into sci-fi in the least bit at all. I really have enjoyed these movies and do not regret the purchase at all!
5,a very addictive show,The first season of this show is bound to leave you wanting more. I bought it because it was a favorite of mine when it aired originally and now I have my boyfriend hooked on it too.
4,A great series.,"We started watching this tv series, it makes you think about if there really are aliens living amongst us? Who knows?"
5,A GREAT SCI-FI SHOW AND A GREAT LOVE STORY,"First off, the dvd set is wonderful, everything works as promised. An amazing amount happens in the three seasons. Fortunately the writers were actually able to bring a very cool ending to the show when they found the show was cancelled. So the show runs from season 1 to season 3 quite smoothly. I am a male, and I really like the love story element in the show. Roswell is unique in its ability to bring off drama, suspense and comedy all in the same episode. You will not regret buying this and it is nicely priced, especially compared to such sets as Farscape and the last 2 seasons of X-Files."
5,The Best Show Ever!!!,From the moment this show first started it was the best. Now it is finally out on dvd. You get to relive all the drama and romance all over again. I can't wait till the next season comes out. This is one show that should have stayed on the air.
4,interesting and enjoyable,"This is a really good series, well done and interesting! The acting is quite credible and the episodes are all very enjoyable. I think that Max and Maria are the two best characters."
5,A Fan Forever,When I heard that a dvd of Roswell was coming out I look everywhere for it and when I found the dvd I was in heaven. I would start with one episode and I would end up with watching like four episode in like a night. I just hope that they'll bring the second season on dvd. And if anybody knows anything about the secong dvd coming out or not just like me know. Thanks
5,A Classic from Depeche Mode,"My new favorite album in the world. What a revelation. I missed this one completely in the 80s, maybe because of the lack of big ""hits"", but I finally picked it up in 2007. Since then it's been the most-played CD by far in my rotation. The tracks delight every time with a variety of energies and moods, atmospheric, danceable and mature, with gorgeous vocals from Gahan and Gore, and sophisticated blends of synthesizers and other sonic surprises, like the rockets on the title track. The sweet spot for me is ""A Matter of Time"" + ""Stripped"". The DVD is a mildly interesting account of their touring and the making of the album. The album is simply terrific, perfect for aging new-wavers."
1,CAN'T PLAY BONUS SONGS ON A NORMAL CD PLAYER,Got as a Christmas Present. Can't play bonus songs in a regular CD player? What a rip off!
3,Only semi-useful to me.,"This book is a typical Dover survey -- page after page of only lightly documented images, line-drawings of items, but no actually pictures of the items cited. As a historical costumer specializing in Keivan Rus' (SCA), I found this book only moderately useful, such as a jumping-off point or idea-prompter. I'm sure this book would be more useful for folk artists and crafters."
3,You must like it,"This book is nice when you love Russian motifs. A lot of paintings are childisch but real. I will use it, but my acspectations are not satisfite."
1,Throw-Away,Tis item has been discontinued and there no refill tank available. It is a one tim use and then throw it away.
5,Highly recommended,"Working in the film business and having been a member of virtual teams in the past, this book has helped me understand why some teams have worked while others haven't. In particular, I enjoyed the section on climate and interpersonal communication and bonding. With the future promising increased use of distance collaboration, this will be my reference for being part of a healthy, productive team. I highly recommend this book."
4,Great Read,"This is a very good book about three holy men whose lives and experiences show the power of faith and God's continued action in our lives. There isn't much original here if you have read books about Solanus, Padre Pio, or St. Andre Bessette, but the author does a great job of laying out their lives, their holines, their humility, and the wonders worked in God's name through their intercession. Holy Simplicity is a significant attribute of each of these men and the author does a great job of showing this. The last paragraph of the book is a fitting way to end this review:""Andre, Solanus and Pio came from marginal beginnings, and they struggled a bit to find their way. They faced failure and hostility. Yet they knew what they wanted to do: to dwell in the house of the Lord and serve God and God's people, especially the poor in body and spirt. Our true vocations can emerge in doing the same."""
1,American Education books aren't as good as this one,The book had a lot of preschool curriculum in it. (see first review about the details). It was a great purchase for my children.
1,This book is not what I thought it would be,I looked at the number of pages and it said that it contain 556 pages. This book is a thin workbook that will not be of help at all.
1,Canine Heraldry,"The idea of a coat of arms for a particular breed of dogs is humourous, at least for the first few pages. The author's blatant disregard for the art of heraldry and utter disdain for the idea of good design will cause this book to grate on the nerves of anyone who appreciates a real coat of arms."
2,waste of $$,"This movie is of poor visual, content, and story/plot quality. I love westerns but this one was very disappointing and a total waste of money."
1,...,I was excited about this product when i first saw it because i needed another cradle and i wanted to take my palm on the road. I though the idea of using batteries to power the Palm Vx was great. I got the BattPac and started using it. At first it worked great. After two sets of batteries the batteries started falling out becuase the clips holding them in are made of very thin metal that bends beneath the weight of the battery. Then the clip on the battery cover cracked off. ...I would hope that... the product would be of much higher quality.
4,POOR QUALITY TAPE,THE WORKOUT WAS GREAT BUT DUE TO THE POOR QUAILITY OF THE TAPEI WAS ONLY ABLE TO USE IT FOUR TO FIVE TIMES. VERY DISAPPOINTINGPURCHASE.
4,Before I say I do,My pastor had me and my fiance read this book. It stated a lot of the obvious. I would have rathered something a little more insightful.
3,Violence and lots of fights.,"Mixed. Very talented writing. Faults: the solution is just a guess, physical clues nonexistent. The murderer and his motive lack credibility. Would appeal more to readers who like violence and lots of fights."
4,Works great,"This product works exactly as you would expect! It took a few tries to get over the learning curve, but once I figured out the correct angle, etc., it worked like a champ. I find that its easier to frost, use the comb to go around the cake once, and then refrost the areas that were a little too thin the first time. Then go around the cake with the comb again. Also, if you hold it at an angle rather than perpendicular to the cake it makes it smoother. I used it on a three-layer cake w/ filling in between each layer, and it was plenty tall enough. The only reason I gave this product 4 stars on Amazon is because of the price. I bought this item at my local Ben Franklin craft store for $1.69 (and that store is usually higher-priced)."
1,"Wow, this was an Epic fail.","The movie is beyond B... well below, badly acted, badly filmed. watched it due to the music track which is the only great thing about this movie. You will regret the minutes of your life lost watching this..."
1,Refilled ink cartridges sold as new,"When I ordered these ink cartridges, Amazon?s product pages said they were new HP ink cartridges. I was wary because the price was low, so I carefully read all the descriptions and other information I could find on Amazon. Nowhere did I find anything that said these were not new. Finally, thinking Amazon would never purposely misrepresent a product, I placed my order. After I received confirmation of the order, I went to the pending order pages and confirmed that I had ordered new HP cartridges. I was sent remanufactured off-brand cartridges. I contacted the supplier, through Amazon, by email and was ignored. I have since seen other complaints about this in Amazon reviews. I feel that Amazon believes they have no responsibility for this and that the supplier believes that Amazon is at fault. I am very disappointed, but nobody seems to care."

4,Great book,This book was very informative and covered a broad range of subjects. Highly recommended!
3,"Informative, perhaps too much so","This is the fourth pregnancy book I've purchased, and I was a bit disappointed. Yes, it contains a lot of information not found elsewhere, but honestly I could have done without reading about all the potential birth defects, fatal complications and generally bad things that can happen. Not for the weak of heart, or the hormonal."
3,"Informative, perhaps too much so","This is the fourth pregnancy book I've purchased, and I was a bit disappointed. Yes, it contains a lot of information not found elsewhere, but honestly I could have done without reading about all the potential birth defects, fatal complications and generally bad things that can happen. Not for the weak of heart, or seriously hormonal."
3,Pretty good book,"It's a large book, however half of it is about after birth and another good part of it is about conceiving, so when I bought it when I was already pregnant and wanted more advice during that time, it seemed like a waste of money."
3,Especially written for those already pregnant,"I was a little disappointed that the book did not cover more in depth how to get pregnant. However, I will keep it around for when I do."
5,Great Book!,"This book has a great section on conception, an aspect missing from many pregnancy books. I highly recommend this easy read that is filled with tips and tricks from conception to birth."
5,Highly recommended!,"This is an amazing book... any woman who is pregnant, or is thinking of trying to conceive should DEFINATLY read this book! It truly covers everything in a funny, easy-to-understand way. She gives wonderful advice.TWO THUMBS UP!!!"
2,Not worth the money,"Against the popular positive review of this book, I think this book is awful. The humor in the book is really humorless. It didn't tell me anything new or that other books haven't already said in a better way. And, the first third of the book is on whether you are ready to be pregnant, how to get pregnant, etc. I am already pregnant and didn't expect the book with its title to spend so much time on this topic. On the up-note, it is written at a 4th grade level, so I have breezed through most of the book in a night. I bought another book at the same time, the Mayo Clinic's pregnancy book and like it so much better. It is truly a valuable, well-researched reference book. Although a bit hefty in size, it is truly useful. The Mayo Clinic book I shall keep for a lifetime. On the hand, I am bringing the Mother of All Pregnancy books straight to Goodwill or the recycling bin."
3,"Lots of fun, little substance","I found the short, chatty discussions in this book annoying and I stopped referring to it very quickly as it never provided good answers to my questions. It's light, it's jolly, it wasn't for me."
1,Waste of time and money,"I have been using this ""thing"" for months now and didn't write a review right away and thought if I keep using it for some time it might actually work! First of all you have to spend one minute on each single hair before you can pull it easily, sometimes it doesnt come out at all, and if it did, it WILL grow back (no such thing as permanent hair removal), so might as well go back to the traditional hair removal methods to save time and energy and you'll get the same results,In my opinion, this product is very inconvenient and impractical to use."
5,Wonderful book by a great man!,"This is a wonderful book wirtten by Linwood Smith who was taken from this Earth way too soon. A brilliant scholar, social activist, and writer! Great book with surprising histories told! I highly recommend it for classes that are exploring deaf culture and African American deaf culture."
3,Nice product...with some exceptions.,"Although I didn't have too many problems typing on the GoType, there were a couple of things that made me wish I had purchased the Stowaway instead. First, the gotype is bulky. It's inconvenient to lug around, and will easily get scratched if you don't buy the case for it (available separately.) The other issue is that the handspring doesn't stay in the cradle very well. It doesn't lock in there and can easily fall out and make you lose your connection. I would have done better with a full-sized keyboard even though my hands are pretty small -- I make a lot of mistakes with this keyboard. Overall, it's okay for home use, but I wouldn't recommend it for travelling."
2,Better than the Stylus / Lesser than the Targus,"I purchased 2 of these when I pre-ordered and thought it would be worth keeping both to share in the office. I was wrong. While the GoType for the Visor is faster to use than the stylus for straight entry, it was difficult to master the keyboard buttons that correspond to the PDA. It is also a little large to carry in a pocket, although a woman may get away with carrying it in her purse/backpack. At that point it loses the immediate practicality in my experience.I also bought the Targus folding keyboard for a few dollars more when it was introduced, and that would be my Handspring-down choice. The Targus folds neatly into a suit-pocket appropriate size and has a roomy feel when extended for typing. I would say that the Targus is twice the keyboard for 10% more in price. Borrow a GoType to try and then buy a Targus to keep and use. You will definitely prefer the Targus."
4,Ultimate Labrador Retreiver,Very detail oriented book. Has a lot of information regarding the breed and care of the breed. I would have liked more information about puppies but this book was a general all around book
1,No Depth.,"The contents of this book would better be found in technical documents such as user guides, architecture guides, and admin guides. That some reviewers report that this may be the only place to find some of this information says more about the paucity of good IBM documentation (or perhaps just the poor organisation of the IBM portal support site) than about the quality of the book.This book is fairly limited to the ""To save your data, click 'save'"" brand of instructions (I thought Microsoft owned the patent on this technique?). Since many many portal configuration pages are self-explanatory, much of this instruction is wasted. And aside from a brief foray into Portlet development, which is a not-too-bad treatment for a neophyte, there is nothing for a developer.Finally, the name is misleading. Certainly, there is nothing in this book that could possibly lead to ""mastery"" of the IBM WebSphere Portal.Don't waste your money."
2,Use a redbook instead,"This book doesn't even come close to its title. While there is some useful information, it appears to be obvious that this book was slapped together in a rush. Chapter 18 ends abruptly. Chapters 19, 20 don't even exist - in fact based on the table of contents pages 354-403 are missing.And don't bother trying to find these pages on the ""companion"" book site. They don't exist there. You have to beg the publisher to get a copy.Honestly, not worth the time - try downloading a free IBM Redbook instead."
1,Great! (For a Paperweight),"Avoid this book at all costs! The title suggests that this book will help you ""master"" WebSphere Portal by giving you ""expert"" guidance. Nothing could be further from the truth! If the authors of this book were masters or experts of the subject, they certainly did not excel at presenting their expertise in book form. The writing is disjointed at best, as if the authors were passing pen and paper around a campfire, creating an improvised story. The text is full of typographical errors. The images (mostly screenshots) are even blurry, almost illegible at times. This book was definitely thrown together in a hurry with no regard for quality or accuracy. The content barely brushes the surface of various topics dealing with WebSphere Portal. There is no ""mastery"" demonstrated. I am very fortunate that the company expensed this book for my team. I would have hated to sink a single cent into this kindling. Stick to free online documentation where you can find it."
4,"Nude home videos, how could you go wrong!","This DVD is just what my girlfriend and I where looking for. Real, good looking, and no fake actors makes this title that much better. I have had a hard time trying to track down an amateur video that the quality is clear and that it wasn't made on dad's old beta video camera. Hey let me know if there is anything else like this out there! The reason I have given it a 4 star is when ever the sceen was close to a croch shot, they would cut away even on their own produced stuff. Make it real, it is what it is, but make it a must see!"
1,Kiss Your Money Goodbye,"This movie would still be overpriced at 49 cents.War of the Planets makes Ed Woods look like a world classmovie maker. The movie was so bad, I had to fast forwardto the end. War of the Planets is so bad that it did noteven make it to the Goodwill Drop-Off. Instead, I made acat toy out of the DVD.."
1,Stay away from this loser,"Astronauts go to an Earth-like planet to colonize it. Their ship crash lands and they have to deal with hostile natives. I should have stopped watching when the alien creature looked like a guy in a cheap gorilla suit. I already knew the acting was bad. But I was hoping it would be like Twilight Zone and have a good ending to make it worth the time spent watching this flick. But no, it sucked.I lost 90 minutes of my life. Now you don't have to."
1,War of The Planets,"This movie was so bad that I wish I could give it a ""No Star"" rating. What a waste of my time, and it will be of yours. I was, no more than 10 minutes into the movie when I finally turned if off..I have no clue what happens to these people on the ship and I could care less. The monster on the ship reminded me of an old Star Trek monster back in the 60's. These actors in ""War of The Planets"" must of really needed the money. You and I could have done better acting. I want the 10 wasted minutes of my life back! I want my money back! God help us all..."
2,Bottom of the Pile,"I read this book cover to cover and it left me with more questions than answers. This book just teases you and then leaves you high and dry. As a source of general knowledge, the book is not bad...not good, but not horrible. It's explanations are relatively lucid. As a resource for installing and troubleshooting hardware, the book fails quite miserably. And just to annoy you, after each chapter there are multiple choice questions that the text doesn't answer. At best you have to make a leap of faith to answer the questions from the knowledge the text provides. Don't waste your money. There are far better books out there, and for the price, you can have your pick of the litter. Pete Moulton might have gotten 1,200 Compaq employees to pass the A+ Exam, but it wasn't by having them read his book. You may be a lot more knowledgeable about computers after reading this book, but you won't be anything resembling a service technician."
3,Lacks any pockets or slots for other stuff,"The Sumdex looks like it will protect the PDA very well, but it has no inside pockets or slots for things such as business cards or credit cards. Also, it has a battery holder but no stylus holder. Its also a bit big for a Palm Pilot. Back in the box it goes."
4,simple case for palm,"I used palm slim leather case. but its design is so poor as I think. so I changed my palmIIIc case to handmade knitting case. but I'm not satisfied with it also. After changing case twice, the 3rd my palmIIIc case is this product, Sumdex Padded Palm Wallet.It's not expensive and its design is not bad, just simple. I think it's the best in cases which I have used. but, the falut of this case is penholder. there's no place to be suitable for my dualpen."

2,Not worth the shipping costs,"I bought this book out of curiosity about the law suit against JK Rowling. Honey, you gotta be kidding. I doubt any child will find this book very entertaining. The first bit had some potential had NK Stouffer bothered to put any effort into working out what could have become a decent story. But then she lazily side steps into the world of the muggles and it starts to sound like a teletubby story book. How could anyone think JKR would waste her time stealing ideas from this I do not know."
1,Harry Potter couldn't save this mess,"As far as the 5 star review from ""Frank Lauver"" of Camp Hill, Pennsylania: Hey Frank, can you tell the Quality Paperback Book Club, which you obviously work for (QPB, also of Camp Hill, PA) to stop sending me that stupid monthly catalog? I bought something from them about 10 years ago and they're still hounding me for a sale."
1,A complete waste of time.,"I bought this book just to see what it was about. I could not even get past the first paragraph before I went back to the store where I bought it at. I returned the book and I find it not even worth the money I spent to buy it!I would pay someone that much money to watch the book burn up. There was no heart, no soul in the book. The author didn't even do anything special with the story.I suggest not wasting your time in buying this book and then wait to get to read this book. Find another book to read as this was not worth your time.I do feel sorry for the author because she did try but she failed miserably with the stories she wrote. She's no JK Rowling. All I can suggest to her is get a beta reader(or a ghost writer) before you had actually thought of publishing this and the other books. You would have gotten very constructive criticism on your books and improve on the whole entire storyline to where it would stand on its own without trouble."
1,not worth the paper it is written on,"I hate to admit I read this book, but I did. The first part reads like a badly writtem romance novel. The rest is so mindless I can't see how it can be compared to being anything like Harry Potter. The writing is insultingly childish and the characters appear stereotyped.(one of the ocean charaters talks like he is from New York). I couldn't find any redeeming qualities in this book. As a lover of good literature and a fan of fanasty books this book should not be placed on any list with such authors as Lewis, T.A. Barron, Susan Cooper or Rowling. If one must read this book borrow it from the library like I did."
2,A frustrating experience,"I looked forward to reading this book and after the first chapter was eager to read more. The first chapter is the best and the remainder of the book was frustrating and meandered around without finding it's core. There are interesting concepts and probably a few great stories to be developed, but none of this connected together. I kept waiting for it to grab me and didn't give up, but at the end felt I had wasted my time. I always recycle books to other readers, but this one will be recycled to the bin."
4,Recommended,"This is the story of Samson, who in his mid-thirties suffers from a tumor in his brain and is found wondering in the desert, not knowing who he is and having lost memory of the last 24 years of his life. The story follows him as he struggles with readjusting to his old life that no longer fits the man he has become, and as he searches for a deeper meaning to what has happened to him. This is a very original story. Nicole Krauss is an obviously talented author and she tackles this subject wonderfully, with just the right balance of sciencitific facts, emotions, reflections on memory, life, the past and future. Excellent and highly recommended."
3,It has its good points,"Without a doubt, this novel raises important, compelling questions. What would you do if you had amnesia and couldn't remember anything after age 12? How would you navigate living in a big city, as Samson and his wife do? How would you feel if you were his wife, students and friends? Though the book is well-written, the characters, Samson especially, didn't really hold my interest."
2,Unenlightened,"The whole story is cliched and predictable. Even Krauss' reflective writing style too often draws on overused metaphors. There seems to be a repetition in the characters introduced; attractive, young, fragile females or father-figure males.The mysterious philosophy of self and memory is not conveyed as well as it could be, leaving the reader unenlightened.The ending is somewhat unsatisfactory.In the novel's credit, the epilogue is beautiful- although the save comes too late.In any case it keeps you reading right til the very unsatisfying end."
4,"This book had a lot in common with Krauss's later novel, The History of Love.","They were both very moving and full of emotion. They were both about memory and loneliness. They both had messy plots full of loose ends. And they both teetered on the verge of sentimentality. I think The History of Love is more accomplished because its characters were more fleshed out. The main characters in Man Walks into a Room, Samson and Anna, were hollow. The most vivid character in the book I thought was Lana, who turned out to be a dead end. Also, I thought the plot needed to be stronger, more believable, and more organic. Both Man Walks into a Room and History of Love were deeply flawed, but still managed to be very enjoyable and engrossing. Krauss is young and has tremendous talent and potential and I'm sure will grow into an even better writer than she is already."
2,Disappointing film with surprisingly weak acting,"This film was a big disappointment. The story subject has all the potentials for a great film, but the script was completely unengaging. The story is supposed to span 16 years but it felt like only a few weeks. Nobody ages throughout the film. Most surprising is the weak acting performances from a cast of usually great actors like Kris Kristofferson, Derek Jacobi and Peter O'Toole. David Wenham's lead performance is especially weak as he struggles with a Belgian accent.The Father Damien story has all the ingredients for a great film; unfortunately these filmmakers failed."
3,Molokai: the Story of Father Damien,"This video had very fine location photography. I visited the actual site so I know they had to film in a different location than the actual leper colony that still exists because that has been modernized.Again, I feel the weak point of the video was that it was based on the book by the same name. I don't feel the book should have been the only source. They should have looked for other sources for the screenplay as the book is weak. It had big name actors in it. That was impressive.But it just didn't get me emotionally involved with Father Damien and I feel that is necessary for a good film."
3,Compromise,"This movie has a couple of scenes that will stick with you for your life. I strongly recommend it, even though I gave it 3 stars. It seems the makers of the movie tried to make a compromise between the historical facts and the emotional struggles of Father Damien. This compromise takes the edge away the movie would potentially have had: after the movie, you still don't know WHY did he go and live amongst the lepers, not something you do for fun or personal glory, is it? I my opinion this movie tends towards a dramatized documentary, but as I said definitely worth watching if you are tired of all the sex and violence that Hollywood has been pooring out these days."
2,Poor Quality,I liked the story. Some scenes moved me. However the quality of the video is poor. I wish the DVD was done in blue ray.
2,Poor song selection for hit-seekers,"The young Aretha Franklin scored a dozen Hot 100 hits during her time on the Columbia label. Yet only half of those appear here. Her first five charted hits from '61 and '62 -- including a Top 40 entry -- are absent, as is a lower-charting single from early '65. There's really no excuse for these omissions in what is, as of this writing, the only available overview of her Columbia years. Pass."
3,Annoying Flaw: Alarm Cannot Be Silenced,"I have owned two of these, and they basically work fine. My big complaint is that a beeping alarm sounds when your power goes out, and the alarm cannot be silenced! So when the power goes out in the middle of the night, even when your computer is not powered on, the BK500 goes beep beep beep beep beep beep... Sigh."
3,We must have other electrical issues...,"We bought this product on a recommendation from Directv forums. Whenever we wash clothes our washing machine is completely knocking out the satellite reception/connection to our Directv box. The forums suggested the use of this device to eliminate the electrical surges and that if it didn't work, there is more than likely problems with the wiring in the house. Well - it didn't work at all! So I guess we need an electrician to check our wiring. We only gave a 3 star rating because under normal circumstances this UPS system might have worked fine but unfortunately we'll never know."
3,Colonix Cleanse,"This cleanse seemed to be working well the first couple of weeks, but results have waned over time. Perhaps it is because there is less that needs to be cleansed, but not sure....just seems to be less effective as the days progress. Not sure I would do a second month as suggested."
3,amla hair oil,"i was searching to stop stress related hair loss and learned about this product. I have used it about 5 times in the last month. Not sure if i have benefitted from it yet. The smell is surely very strong.I'""ll keep using it. The shipping was speedy. I wonder if the seller has dried preserved amla as well. This berry has several health benefits."
3,daughter loves!,"Not one of my favorites, but my 4yr old daughter watched it once and begged for months for me to buy it. She watches it several times a week. She loves that the boy gets to save his mom."
3,Mars needs Momns,I'm not crazy about this story line but my little man (2 yrs old) loves it. He watches it almost every day - when we aren't watching Woody & Buzz.
3,Fun but could use more material!,A fun and enjpyable movie but seemed to be lacking in clear direction of where it is going or trying to provide to the viewer. I think that the younger < 13 groups will enjoy this a great deal more than anyone older.
2,"Rent, don't buy","Thankfully we got this movie from the library and did not spend any money to rent/buy it. My 11 year old son and 7 year old daughter watched the whole thing and their final commentary was that it was ""weird and a little boring, but OK."" They both said it's not one they would want to watch again."
1,"Scary, Creepy, Ugly, and Mean",We had to turn this off for our 7-year-old twenty minutes in because he was scared. Then we watched it after putting the kids to bed and it NEVER got any better. It is hard to imagine this movie being a hit with any kids. It isn't silly or colorful or lighthearted or loving - Yikes.
3,well-acted but mediocre story,"There was nothing inspiring or heart-warming about this mangled love triangle; the femme fatale was unworthy of the viewer's sympathy and Woody Harrelson was the consummate big-hearted, hot-tempered heavy-drinking loyal-to-the-end type with a big heart; his untimely demise only makes the film seem to spiral downward even more relentlessly."
1,Not receiving Star,"I ordered Star magazine in late December 2003 for my elderly homebound mother who loves the crosswords. She stopped receiving it in June, well before her 12 month subscription expired."
2,It's nothing really special....,"I think Stan needs a more in depth documentry film on his life, these interviews are short and mostly not as informative as you would like."
5,Truly Excellent!,This DVD left me riveted! I bought it for my teenage son who is a comic book fan and was pleasantly surprised at how much I loved it. As a writer I was fascinated by Stan Lee's story-telling brilliance and journey. This is perfect for the comic book fan and non-fan alike.
5,Perfect,Murray Is one of the greatest pianists who ever lived. He is great at every composer. These etudes prove my point even further. These etudes take about 5 years to learn and record and it is great when they are played this well! Buy this!
4,Palm tree lover,cute design but metal is a little thin and there are no drain holes but they are very cute and pretty good quality
4,"Excellent content, prepare to work","I think this is an excellent book. No criticism of any aspect.However, be warned, this is not a quick read or something you can absorb without work. Prepare to read slowly, talk or think, and apply.The authors come at this book from a Christian perspective. I think the book applies to anyone, as the principles are true."
3,"Weaker than the last, better than some others, all in all ok","I thought this book was weaker by far than it's ancestor, Kushiel's Dart. It's hard to follow and the language doesn't ring like it did in the first book, but rather clunks and clogs from time to time. Still, it isn't awful. The first person account gets a little tiresome about midway through the book, and the relationship with Joscelin does nothing for me. Still, I would recommend reading the Kushiel books, assuming you are not squeamish or easily put off by sex of a deviant nature, including child prostitution and glorified S&M. I tend to not make assumptions about the proclivities of an author, but this one made me wonder."
2,"End it soon, please","'Enjoyed' would not be the word I would use to describe how I felt when reading Kushiel's Dart. It made me uncomfortable, not because of its graphic sex and s/m elements, but because I thought the prose was sickeningly sweet and rich, the marks of a somewhat talented amateur, and I also thought the heroine was grotesquely perfect [jeez! Great in bed and she can SING, too! The J-Lo of fantasy!] But I did like it enough to buy this one. What a mistake.This book shows that an arguably brilliant beginning is difficult to sustain. Ms. Carey told a fine story the first time out, but it is now wearing thin. I don't know if I will bother to read the [hopefully] last of the Kushiel books, but if I do, I am certain it will not be in hardcover."
4,Enthralling and engrossing,"This is a compelling novel. The land of Terre d'Ange is one to which I'd gladly move, and I am grateful to Jacqueline Carey for opening the door to it. As in Kushiel's dart, the novel is a superb mix of comparative religion and history, erotica, and just good writing."
4,"Good, but not amazing","All 3 of the books in this series are great to read with the rich detail of the world, and all the great intrigue. Kushiel's Avatar is a good ender book, full of action and the author frantically trying to tie up all the loose ends. Like the first two, there are so many political threads flying around, that after a time you either get it and love it, or you give up on trying to keep track of it all and focus on what is happening with the characters.If you are looking to get into this series, definately start with the first book. If you are browsing for a new series to read because you just finished one, or you have a break between books, this would be great for you.The quality of this book compaired to Dart and Chosen, is very weak. Yes, it is written well, but there are certain things that aren't of the same standard. However, the story is still wonderful, and it is definately worth purchasing just to find out the rest of what happens to the people."
4,Elua Blessed This Writer!,"As a huge fan of the previous novel Kushiel's Dart, I am so very happy this writer could do a follow up to it, that didn't fall too much below it's predecsor. It's not perfect but for second novel and middle book to a trilogy it is very good."
4,good value,"The Taylor 7000 is a little small. Good for tight areas or small people. I have trouble getting my entire foot on the surface (size 9) It takes a few seconds to display the weight, but it is fairly accurate."
4,nice an dcompact,This is a nice scale but the best about it is that it is compact and is almost unoticable in the bathroom. It is an excellent choice for small baths. The quality is OK ...
1,This scale is bunk,"This scale is terrible. According to it, my weight can fluctuate by 3-4lbs. per week. It's very discouraging, I think I'll throw it out and just judge by the fit of my clothes."
2,worthless...,"This scale is for if you want a general idea of your weight. I've stepped on this thing before taking a shower and right afterward and it will say that i've gained or lost 1-2.5 pounds depending on its mood. If you shift around to practically any amount it will say Err. It also takes forever to get a reading, sometimes up to 30 seconds, even with a new battery. Take the keys out of your pocket and you won't be any lighter, then take your wallet out and magically you've lost 3 pounds! Also, if the LCD is in a shadow of say, a hamper or a cabinet, you can't read the numbers. save your money and get a better scale."
1,Another case of incorrect packaging.,"Chock up another mislabeled package and DVD. I was looking forward to The CrawlingEye on DVD, got the sealed case from Movie Mars, and looked like what I had ordered. Nope, another ""Night of the Ghouls' instead. The Crawling Eye is far better sci-fi fare than this ""Night of the Ghouls"" imposter."
4,An example of how good bad can be.,"You need to be a fan of silly, classic '50's Sci-Fi films to appreciate The Crawling Eye to really enjoy it. If you are not, don't waste your time. This movie has some really bad visual effects (Two men, mountain climbing in the Swiss Alps. It was so obvious that they were placed in front of a bad painting, I enjoy that scene over and over.), but it's the acting and the story that really pulls it together. It's amazing that actors can give such convincing performances while standing in cardboard sets! On a positive note, the eyeball creatures were actually not bad. A nice little classic ""Creature Feature"" that should be in everyone's collection."
4,surprising good though still a bad 50's scifi movie,"I watched The Crawling Eye because I knew it as the first Mystery Science Theater 3000 movie. I watched it and was surprised by how decent a movie it really was. It was on AMC and Leonard Maltin introduced it. In that intro he notes how, as in Jaws, we never see the monster until late in the movie. This makes for a fine movie... until we see the monster. At that point the movie starts to degrade. Even the dialogue becomes rather, well, stupid in the end. It starts provoking laughter when previously it was a respectable and enjoyable film. Leonard Maltin's bit here mentions the bad effects. They are aren't effective and I guess that makes them bad but I was impressed by the detailed models they made for this movie. They were impressive in detail but didn't fool anyone. It does have numerous down sides but most of it was much better than I expected. This is not a great movie but it was a fine movie and I enjoyed it."
5,Best Of Its Era. Acting More Than Cinematography.,"DeForest Kelly (F Troop) Stars is this believable story where aliens inhabit a mountain side in Switzerland. I get more every time I watch it! Its not the monster! Its the buildup. The evacuation, the cold! The mountain climber with no head! Listen to dialog and find out it happened elsewhere!"
4,A Classic Horror,"The movie was a clear joy. Fun to watch because we were so terrified as kids when we last saw it. Still thrilling and creepy. The film itself was in good shape and easy to watch,the audio clear also. Very enjoyable and recomended."
4,Any one looking for a better understanding of the American Indians fought,"It kept my interest as well as providing a better picture of what the Indianns and whites face when faced with conflect. It's a quick read, but Ican better understand the position of the killings done by both sides."
4,"Great, but a tight fit","I love it because my laptop, flash, camera and accessories fit, but getting out the camera takes a bit of manuevering. However, while other camera bag straps have left my clothes worn in a strip where the canvas/seatbelt like material has rubbed, the neoprine is not ruining yet another outfit--so that's cool."
1,I can't believe you actually sell this!,20 minutes long if that. This is what you consider a documentary! Shot from a camcorder this is a true joke and amazingly you try to sell this as a documentary. The sound is horrible the interview is horrible and it looks as though I was watching a homemade (movie) in the silent era before film or video technology were discovered. A complete waste of money and time. Being a huge Ted Williams fan this would have turned him over in his grave! He would have never allowed you to put this out i can assure you. Take this off the market or Amazon needs to look at this. I will be reporting this to Amazon as well. An embarrassing joke to say the least!
4,Good story and characters; a bit overwritten,"It's a good story with interesting characters. However, it could have been 50 pages shorter with some good editing (it is too repetitious in places). Excellent light reading. Made me want to take Italian lessons"
5,One of my favourites,One of my favourites of Maeve Binchy's collection. This and Quentins are my two favourite books. Heartwrenching love story and travel guide all in one...that is a perfect book for me.
3,Not bad but not great,So when I first started reading Evening Class it felt a little slow and mundane. At the same time the characters were easy to relate to because they had the issues that most people will face in their everyday life. There is nothing exceptionally exciting about the book but you do find yourself invested in the character's well being. The evening class is an Italian Class teaching beginning Italian that brings together people in Dublin from all walks of life. The class takes these characters away from their problems at home and in their relationships and becomes a home away from home. The class instills a sense of worth and camaraderie among the characters that they are failing to get in their everyday lives. It is very much a heartwarming story in the sense that you want the best for each of these characters because they are good people that live average lives.
2,Used pocket book,Service was prompt by this provider. Book was in only fair condition as it was old and obviously used.
3,Big and Beautiful,"This leather ""wallet"" looks very professional, has plenty of compartments for credit cards, cash, checkbook, etc. The closure is actually a magnetic snap, not velcro (which is better anyway). It's not very well padded, this case is more for transport and convenience than for protection. My problem is that the review wasn't very clear that this is for Palmtops, or much larger organizers. I have a HP Jornada 540 Series and this is WAY TOO BIG! I'm very disappointed as there aren't too many cases out there for my size PDA. Other than that, this would be a great buy, it's very nice."
1,From Back Cover,"Sam Cooper, P.I. - Jeaded and cynical. A real loner. This rogue refuses to take any case where there's more at stake than money. He's been down that road before.Jessica Burkett - Impetuous and daring. And loyal to a fault. Something has happened to her sister, Nicole. And only the arrogant, irritating and drop-dead gorgeous Sam Cooper can help her.It's soon obvious that Sam Cooper's in over his head. In his search for Nicole, he's made some powerful - and deadly - enemies. But worse, he can't seem to keep his hands off Jessie. But will she still want him when she no longer needs a hero?"
2,Not as good as the other Joe Grey books I've read,"I wanted to like this book, but I just can't get through it. I like the cats, and I'm able to suspend disbelief that they talk. I'm about 20% through the book, and it's just been focused on a burglar that Joe keeps following. Also, Dulcie keeps trying to get Joe to visit a senior's home. There's just so little happening and what is happening is boring to me. There's been little mention of the humans who I've gotten to know and would like to hear about. I've read three other Joe Grey books, which I thought were fun, but this one leaves me cold."
5,Great story! Wonderful book!,"A friend of mine recommended this book to me. We both have been researching early American pioneer life. This book is a novelized version of a true story. Mary Draper Ingles was 9 months pregnant, living on the Virginia frontier, when she and two of her children were kidnapped by Shawnee Indians during the French and Indian War. The author did his research well. It's a story of amazing fortitude. She escaped and returned home months later barely alive. The novel was made into a tv movie of the same name."
5,Undying Faith,"I just finished the book this morning and could not wait to find out more about Mary.I live in Virginia in the Shenandoah Valley.So this story really touched close to home.It made me wonder if I would have had the courage and strength to go on.I felt it was I that was Mary.It made me think about the woods beside my house.To imagine this woman,naked,starving,battered and totally at the mercy of freezing wind,rain,and snow getting up each day to go on leaves me in such awe of her courage and strength.I understood her relationship with ""Ghetel"".I was inspired by her faith in God.Thank you Thom for this book.It will forever stay in my mind and heart."
5,one of the best,"I read Follow the River many years ago and it is still one that I whould tell young, old, male or female to read, it was very grafic, and the story kept me turning page after page, it is truly the only book I have seen my husband read every night, I have given this book to many people as gifts and they pass it to others, I once gave it to a friend in a small town and after a few months, people were telling me I should read this book called Follow the River."
4,a very good read,Our book club chose this selection and it was very well received. It is a good story told in a very captivating way. The story and characters fostered much discussion. A true hidden gem. I plan to read all of his other books. A good read indeed.
4,a more realistic review,"I am surprised that three reviewers hated this book, but I am also surprised that the other 48 almost all gave it 5 stars. This novel, while absorbing, is not perfect. Mary's inner dialogues (and her dialect) may or may not be historically accurate, but she does suffer from shades of melodrama. The descriptions of scenery on her journey home could have been edited down some.However, these are not fatal flaws. The book is graphically violent in places, but much less than, say, _All Souls' Rising_, which was a National Book Award Finalist. The violence in _Follow the River_ is not gratuitous but presuamably accurate to its time and place. No, this is not a children's book, but no one said it was; and my best friend and I first read and appreciated it at twelve or thirteen in a way a few adults have obviously been unable to. Finally, does Mary ""willingly abandon"" her children? Good grief, what a claim!"
5,This captive story makes you feel like you were there.,"Mary Ingles' great love for her husband was the connecting link that gave her the courage and strength to make her way home. Captured by the Shawnee, Mary walked 1,000 miles from Big Bone Salt Lick in Indiana back to Drapper's Meadow in Virgina. Everytime the weather is freezing here (Northeast Ohio), I imagine Mary walking without any protection from the elements. The Ohio River was her guide. I am not a strong swimmer and can't belive how she (a nonswimmer) had to forge many parts of the river to continue her journey. The descriptions in the book are so vivid, that while I was driving, I was able to identify cliffs and the New River in Virginia described in the story before I saw any road signs. I also was able to walk a part of the trail that Mary actually traveled. The trail was very dense and heavily wooded. I felt like I needed to be on the lookout so that I wouldn't be captured. I guarantee you won't be able to put the book down."
5,A Great Book,I have been very happy that i bought this book . I enjoyed Follow The River so much that now i am considering ordering more books by Alexander Thom . It is well written and interesting . I bought the book used and had no problem with the condition . I would recommend to anyone to yes do buy this from Amazon.com .
4,my favorite re- read!,"this was probably my favorite DS book! she tells a GREAT story, and while I cried for poor Hilary, I loved the transition from cold and empty to warm and loving.. very well written, and I've read it a NUMBER of times!!"
3,Good subject ; tough to gst started.,Got this because I'm a bit of a history buff.Still trying to get it started.I'm not giving up.
1,EGG ALLERGY ALERT,This product contains LECITHIN!LECITHIN is an egg protein its NOT listed on the bottle as the warning!!DO NOT USE IF YOU HAVE AN EGG ALLERGY!My niece nearly had to go to the ER!
2,Something for voyeurs of either gender,"I checked this dvd out from the public library, to familiar myself with the opera before the Metropolitan broadcast last Saturday. I found more familiarity than was necessary. The topless dancers, the bare male behinds, and Thais' exposed breast added nothing to the quality of the production. The dancer who writhed on the giant cross during the ""Meditation"" was so muscular that there was no eroticism (if that was intended).If you want a dvd of this opera, wait a few months for the Metropolitan's production with Renee Fleming. Based on the broadcast, it is sure to be a winner."
4,Sweet!,"Two for the price of... actually they may be cheaper than other singles I've seen. I've had mine for a couple of weeks now, and they are wonderful! All the controls work wonderfully. [[I was worried that they'd be a cheap knock off or something.]] The only downside is that this particular type of pad crinkles if you slide your feet around, so it's best for beginners."
4,Fabrication w acrylic sheet,The supplier provided timely service and delivery of the product at a reasonable cost. The hot wire was used as a heat source to fabricate parts from sheet acrylic. A typical acrylic sheet can be used continuously in a temperature range of 170-190F. A typical acrylic sheet begins to soften between 210-220F and starts to melt between 300-315F.
2,poor quality,"This table cover is made of a very thin green plastic. I am very dissapointed with this item, because it is called ""Deluxe"", so it made me expect something made with a better material quality. On the other side, it fits ok on my 8' billiards table."
5,it keeps it clean,it keeps it clean from dust and other stuff cant complain about it just a little to big for it
2,As much as I love Bleach....,I really hated it when they started taking away the 'box' from the box sets. They used to come with 5-6 disks now its 3 for the same amount of money! It's stupid! Not only that but what's supposed to be season 11 is actually season 8. Season 11 is supposed to be episodes 206-212. Which is so short they should put it with another season. I really hate spending $30 for 3 disks instead of the usual 5-6. At this rate I wouldn't be surprised if more people started watching it online. I'm really thinking about it.
2,Average collection of world and theater masks.,"Hardcover with DJ, 11"" x 8.75"", 231 pages, 157 illustrations, 24 in color. Published by Harry N. abrams, Inc, New York, 1970.This is definitely not a tribal mask book, but rather a very 1970's examination of all manner of practical and artistic 'masks"" throughout the world. In this book, ski goggles, welding masks, gas masks, medical masks and astronaut masks get as much attention as theatrical masks, make-up masks and (what the book refers to as) ""primitive"" masks. I'm not sure why an old-world deep-sea diver's helmet, or a radiation protective suit, or a photo of Salvador Dali, or a lady in a floppy hat, or a 60's hippy with too much eye-shadow, or a English barrister with a silly wig, can possibly constitute ""Great Masks."" Dated and largely irrelevant."
5,You can't tell me he wasn't having fun,"Remember this says ""Journal"" and that is what it is. It is his first parson adventures on and off the Beagle. He even includes stories about the people on the ship, the ship's life, and maintenance. He is always going ashore and venturing beyond the ship charter to go where no Englishman has gone before. He makes friends with tyrants and the down trodden. Once, to get an animal to come to him, he lay on his back and waved his arms and legs in the air. Whatever you do, do not turn your back on him. He is always knocking something on the head and taking it back for study. It is fun trying to match the old names for places with the new."
1,Unless you want to explain genders to your kids - don't go!,There are transexual cows in this movie or at least really confused ones because male cows DO NOT HAVE UDDERS. They have penises.How stupid are the animators? Or did they not want to offend the FCC?
1,DVD was junk,This DVD was clearly repaired to cover up scratches. It skips a lot and the DVD menu freezes if you try to do anything but play the movie. There was 2 whole parts of the movie missing!?! Just glad my 2 year old doesn't mind to much
2,Eh,"Neither I nor my son enjoyed this one. Over The Hedge- Cute, entertaining movie. This- Even when you get past the bulls with udders, I thought that there were a lot of elements of this film that weren't appropriate for children under 10. There were some cool jokes and sparse pieces of snappy writing- Sam Elliot singing Tom Petty was fun, but the animation of the few people in the movie and the coyotes was a little dark and ugly for my kid. I felt like I watched two movies- one was the Nick TV show, the other a kind of stark coming of age flick. The animation style seemed to change depending on which part of the script you were in- it just seemed choppy. Both concepts on their own were decently done (except for the bulls with udders), but there was enough questionable content that I won't be owning this one or even watching it again."
5,Barnyard,"Lots of fun and some action. It is an excellent movie for children and adults too. I love this movie. Otis is so funny and all the animals are funny and have so much personality, that it is just great FUN!! You will love it!"
3,Barnyard,"`Barnyard' is another computer animated film that seems to be saturating the movie market at the moment. This follows Otis the cow as he takes on the responsibility of being leader of the Barnyard, despite wanting to be a party animal. The animation is pretty basic and you can see a lot better in most Pixar films and the storyline is simple and formulaic. I get the feeling this film is aimed more squarely at the child audience as there seems to be no `in jokes' that parents can enjoy or those quirky touches from Pixar films that make them enjoyable for a wider audience. The soundtrack is pretty good featuring songs by both Tom Petty and Peter Gabriel, but this may have been the only saving grace for the film! If you accept that this film is one for the kids then it will be great to put on and see them enjoy it, just don't expect anything to engage an adult audience at the same time.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
4,Mower blade sharpener,I purchased the Arnold Corp. mower blade sharpener because I inadvertently hit a rock while mowing my lawn and dinged the blade. The design of the sharpener makes it easy to maintain the correct angle of the blade when sharpening. The mower blade balance was useful and critical to insuring the blade was balanced after sharpening. I would recommend this item to anyone wanting to fix a dinged lawn mower blade.
5,Pleased. Its a great book.,"I am pleased with this book. It is a great book talking about really surrendering your life to God, the practicals and challenges."
1,DO NOT BUY,This thing killed my iPod and then the company wanted another $100 to fix it. And when I didn't want to do that they wouldn't take the battery back. This $40 bucks ended up costing me $400 more. STAY AWAY
4,Excellent thriller you probably haven't heard about,"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the story and, although some elements were predicatable, there are unexpected twists that make this a great viewing experence. Admittedly, I hadn't seen any promos or trailers for the movie and only chose to watch it based on the videography of the two main actors, Luke Wilson and Samuel L. Jackson.If you like suspense thrillers you won't be disappointed!"
3,Just ok,"The move was ""okay""... The two main characters were fine... the acting from everyone else was pretty bad. There was a little twist in it. The plot was a little strange... just okay... Glad I didn't have to pay to see it."
4,I like it.,"I like the excavator, but would be better if it were metal. My son has to be careful when playing with it so it doesn't break."
4,my grandson will not stop playing with it !!!,my grandson loves this caterpillar he plays with it all the time .very happy with it would buy it again
4,Big Toys for Big Boys!,"4yr old son Loves Bruder toys and this Excavator is no exception, easy to use, great detail and seems fairly durable. The only problem you may encounter is pinched fingers from using the handle incorrectly. As with most Bruder toys they come big so you may end up like me giving up garage space to store your boys Bruder collection.."
3,"Cool truck, but returned due to durability concerns","This is a very cool toy, but my wife and I decided to return it after seeing how flimsy some of the parts were, especially the tracks. We've purchased several other Bruder trucks, which seem to be better made than this."
2,plastic and flimsy,"too much plastic and flimsy for the price, doubt it will last long with a 7 year old boy. not happy"
3,Good for Improving Listening Skills,"Advanced Italian by Living Language has pluses and minuses. I felt the book was a bit lower level than it could have been, covering topics found in any half descent Italian grammar. The CD's were really good though. The accents were great and the different topics and conversations covered made them most useful. Beware the audio is definitely for advanced speakers, if you find it too difficult (as I first did) continue your studies and when ready pop them back in. I found them excellent for advancing my listening skills. All in all, I likeBerlitz Advanced Italianbetter, but this was a course worth taking even if just for the audio. Recommended."
3,"High Priced, Better out There",I bought this based on the reviews and have been disappointed. I've used Neutrogena Microdermabrasion kit with cream since it came out and haven't found anything that works better for my skin. This was nice but VERY overpriced for what you get.
3,Back to the Archives,"This is a very intriguing release; the numbers were recorded in 1973 and not released until 1986 after being remixed by Edgar Froese.The standout is the title track, as Froese again demonstrates his expressiveness on guitar with a solo that drives the soundscape for nearly five minutes. White Clouds, Astral Voyager and Indian Summer are interesting due to the synthesized noises that weave around the keyboard-driven melodies.While difficult to definitively rate the work in the vast TD catalog, it is an accessible album for those wishing to hear the band for the first time."
5,Amazing,"I LOVE these boots!! They are so comfy and the coolest thing is that you dont even have to wear socks! I love everything about these boots although I wish they weren't as bulky, im skinny and they look a little silly on my toothpick legs but i dont even care because i love them so much! Cant wait for winter so i can wear them more!"
2,Where's my size???? Grrrrr!!!,I want this in my size - give me a 10 because I wear thick socks. You should try and offer more sizes :( I live in circumpolar America for goodness sakes!!!!
3,Buyer beware,"I had a handcranked checkwriter and it did more than this electronic checkwriter. It embossed the payee so it cannot be ultered and the writing of the numbers were better on the handcranked checkwriter than this electronic check writer.Was going to return it but couldn't get a refund as I would have been given a credit and I had to use it at the store I bought it from, but since they don't have anything that I want, I am forced to keep it."
5,i love it thanks best seller,The Coconut Oil Miracle (Previously published as The Healing Miracle of Coconut Oil)my father in law love it so much... thanks you made me happybest seller.His really healthy conscious so he will love this book...
2,Weight gain,"I checked out this book at the public library. It is well written and interesting. However, I started ingesting 3 TBL of coconut oil daily. I am a 51 year old female, 5ft 5"" @ 123 lbs. At first, I lost 4 lbs. However, after a month, I gained up to 125 lbs. I think I originally lost, because the oil upset my stomach and it does clean out your system. So it did NOT rev up my metabolism or give me energy. I cook with it, and use it in my hair, but that's it. I stopped taking it by itself and went down 3 lbs. At first it cured my sugar cravings, but only for a couple weeks. I think it can do good, but do not take it just to lose weight, it won't happen."
5,I really enjoyed the book!,"Actually purchaed the book with two jars of the coconut oil. Since I had previously read that using the oil with cooking and also, in the place of lotion, and for oiling, I wanted to be well informed about the product. This book is an easy read, and enjoyed it."
5,Great Read,Beneficial read for anyone interested in living a healthy lifestyle and taking advantage of all the benefits coconut/coconut oil gas to offer.
2,overrated,"This product is entirely overrated.It is not as many claim a miracle cure.Their is so much hype in the nurtrition field.Eat a balanced overall diet,avoid to much sugar and fats. That's it"
5,Great Replacement,I ordered two of these to replace the old rusted ones in the recessed soffit lights at the Jersey Shore. They fit perfect and installed in a minute.
4,Good card for the price,"We bought four of these for use with dental cameras. There was some odd behavior at first just getting the drivers to work and integrate with the dental software, but once we got it figured out they work just fine."
2,Low flow...,This is a very nice looking faucet. It has a nice finish.It has very low flow. I used this for a client and it provides a third of the flow of the faucet that it replaced.
4,Music from a Primordial Temple...,"A fantastic bit of music. The type of music I would expect to float from an otherworldly temple rendered in an old 70's issue of Heavy Metal (illustrated fantasy) magazine. Long Live Den!!! I purchased Exit as well, but MUCH perfer Atem. Very much worth the dime."
5,Unbelievably Beautiful Sound,"I was surprised that the Craftsman Chime has such a lovely, deep sound, as it only has 4 satin black square tubes/chimes, and yet the sound is extremely clear. You will be amazed, just holding the chimes, they are already chattering. I browsed the Woodstock web site, to hear the lovely sounds, as well as compare their price. There is a savings when purchased from Amazon!"
3,where is the music??,I ordered these windchimes I liked the look and sound and had great customer reviewsThey are nice looking but have yet to hear them unless I hit the striker and we have had some good gusts of wind. I didnt want a display piece I wanted to hear chimes. I had an old non name set for nearly 8 years which sounded good with a hint of a breeze Other than looks not impressed with these chimes!
1,PROBLEMS,"THE PERFUME I BELEIVE WAS WATERED DOWN, SECONDLY I AM VERY ANGRY THAT I PAYED FOUR DOLLARS FOR GIFT WRAPPING AND WHAT I GOT WAS A BOX IN A BOX FILLED WITH PAPER SHAVINGS, I USUALLY LOVE YOUR COMPANY BUT THIS TIME I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED AND WOULD LOVE MY MONEY BACK, AT LEAST THE $4.00 FOR THE GIFT WRAPPING. THE WHOLE GIFT WAS A DISSAPOINTMENT. SINCERELY ROBERT LAWERENCE"
5,A wonderful addition to your child's library!,"This story is charming, well-told and timeless. The bunnies have the sniffles and Mama bunny wants to make them soup to help them get well. All the animals in the forest end up joining in to get rid of their own sniffles, contributing a little of this and a handful of that until Mama Bunny's soup is a delicious kettle of get-well stuff. Your child will love the animals and you will love the way the story moves along."
4,A good looking film.,Good prformances. It's an art gang picture that uses Shakespeare's Richard III. Low budget. Thoughtfuly photographed. Splendid art direction. Story is hard to fallow at times. But it's hubris in performances and directing make up for it. Cult Film. Fun!
4,life of chuck,chuck writes well here in this book that goes till the late 80's. he may need tow riter another that takes him further on down the road. the photos are week in the book and could have been edited a bit better but overall this is a pleasant read.
2,Snow Queen Flop,"Right as I'm writing this review, I'm watching 'The Snow Queen.' And I'm really, really disappointed.It's really, really, REALLY LAME.The movie starts out well with good music, good atmosphere and passable acting. It's like this until we see the adult Gerta, and the whole movie goes downhill.The script is horrible; it makes one feel as though the writers deliberately chose the most awkward phrases for this movie to make one flinch. The acting is wooden, and the two main characters aren't likable in the least. Although I liked the Snow Queen the first time Gerta saw her (in all her dark-maiden glory), this was lessened the next time she came along. I felt they made a major mistake in making the Snow Queen have an american accent and speak casually - it makes her seem much less regal and imposing. I cringed when she said ""c'mere.""Don't bother watching this movie - it's long, it's dumb, and it's boring."
3,NOT FOR KIDS!,I am not sure of the intended audience for this film. It is a very wierd film! Thematic elements ( eg the (suggestive) seduction of young Kai by the Snow Queen) & some very disturbing scenes render this film definitely inappropriate for children.
2,review,"it is very, very borring. If you like to fall asleep at the movies this movie will do it for you. More for women"
5,LTJ review,"Ever since I heard ""this is going nowhere"" off a compilation cd I've been hooked on LTJ since. Pezcore I would have to say is one of their best albums. It captures the perfect ska-punk mix i loved, with fast paced beats mixed with somewhat depressing themes of feeling trapped, isolated...but hopefull at the same time.Over the years LTJ's sound has changed...my feeling is not for the better. Their last few albums feel very studio polished and commercial...which makes me long for the rough, fast pace train-spanking songs they used to write. Pezcore epitomizes LTJ's best and to this day still holds a special place in my great albums list."
2,worst of Gordon Liu,"This has to be the worst Gordon Liu movie I have ever seen. I know that there are others that are on par with the badness of this movie. But on the other hand, this is one of the better Godfrey Ho films. So if you like his stuff, you might be dissapointed at how he almost manages to put together a story in this movie. I thought that some of the fights were very watchable, but the guy who plays the Pei-Mei like character was the most imcompetent martial artist that I have ever seen.The only reason that this DVD got a 2/5 was because of the extras. The # of clips on this DVD has to total around an hour and a half or 2. Some of the best fights ever captured on screen are on this disc."
1,Fury in the Shaolin Temple,"If you like Gordon Liu, then don't waste your money on this DVD. Gordon Liu is in the movie, but this movie does not show off his talent at all. The plot and the story are not good and the action is boring. The DVD format is sharp (considering this is an old movie) but the color format is not that great."
1,Was that a flashback?,"No, it was just another boring album by Tangerine Dream. I have a really hard time figuring this band out. I first started listening to them when Optical Race came out and have liked most of their albums since then. I have started listening to their older music and have not been impressed.This album is extremely monotonous. Zeit is a great title for it. It is as if time has stopped and you will be tortured by this garbage for all eternity.I would recommend focusing on the bands work from the mid-80's on."
4,Good kung fu movie,"I bought this movie because I'm constantly looking for Bruce Li movies. I have to say it's one of the best kung fu movies that Bruce Li stars in. The acting may be a little tongue-in-cheek, but the fight choreography is great. And Simon Yuen adds a little more autenticity to the film, starring as Bruce Li's blind teacher. This is a must for hardcore kung fu fans around."
2,Good but not great,Has good ingredients and could be nice to have around when your go-to products are out...BUT not sure what all the hoopla has been about. Definitely not a must-have.
5,Makes my hair feel so good,"great product, must buy if you are obsessed with your hair like I am. Buy for a Great price. Yippeee"
3,Good but not necessary,"I purchased this book thinking I will look up every word I came across in cases. Turns out I hardly ever open it. It is much easier and faster to turn to the internet. This book is also very large and, for a student, that becomes troublesome with all the other case books. If you want to purchase a law dictionary, it is a much better idea to go with the pocket edition."
5,Great legal dictionary!,I am a 1L in law school and I can say that Black's Law Dictionary Eighth Ed. is a very thorough and helpful legal dictionary. I have been able to find virtually every troubling legal term. Black's makes it easier to comprehend legalese!
4,A moving tribute to the courage of the human spirit.,This is a haunting book. It is amazing what the human spirit can endure when there is bit of hope. Susie's mother not only was determined that they both would survive but she retained her humanity in the process often sharing rations and thinking of ways to help the other prisoners. Sometimes the writing is stiff but is reminds you the story is being told by a child's viewpoint. This would be an excellent book to recommend to students who have read The Diary of Anne Frank and want to know more about the Holocaust.
5,Profound,"This is a very profound and deeply personal account of a fight for survival and a search for meaning. This is a very intimate memoir and gives cause for many deep breathes,sighs,shock, shared grief, and triumph.So well written with an honesty that is rare. The translation from German to English by my friend James Skofield, is exceptional and lends directly to the intimacy and loss one feels as the reader.This is one of those books that I put back on my shelf once I read it;I can glance from a distance at its cover and I KNOW and remember.PROFOUND."
1,Sadistic. Not very much fun.,"I loved Jumper, and have given copies to friends. But I don't recommend this to anybody. There is too much suffering and misery for the lead character as he is kept prisoner. I usually have no problem with the protagonists overcoming adversity. But this just seemed sick to me."
5,Great Dartboard,This is one of the best dartboards on the market. It is totally staple free and built to last. I highly recommend it.
5,Great music!,"I had this version of Les Mis on VHS growing up and I loved it. It's nice to have the music to listen to in the car on long trips. I also like that the album has pretty much the entire musical, not just the major songs."
3,Nice,"this was great, but not stunning... the most stunning is the original broadway recording... although Lea Salonga is great here, she can't be compared to Frances Ruffelle, who is in both the original London and Broadway Cast Recording... and the girl who plays Fantine doesn't sound as well as the Fantines in the recordings i suggested. Valjean is definately better and has a more stable voice in the other recordings as well. overall, i would recommend either one of the original recordings over this one..."
5,I Dreamed a Dream,Ever since this 10th Anniv. Celebration was broadcasted on public television back in 1995 I have been totally in love with Les Miserables. This soundtrack to that wonderful performance is just as exceptional as the production itself. The best voices from past productions (including the one and only Jean Valjean Colm Wilkenson and the highly acclaimed Michael Ball as Maurius) were all pulled together for this anniv production and the result is astounding. For those like me who have heard mainly the Les Mis soundtrack with the Original Broadway Cast - use this set of CDs to re-discover of charm of Les Miserables. If you are looking for your first soundtrack for Les Mis - this is the one to get. I highly recommend this soundtrack and the DVD as well. This Dream Cast performance at the Royal Albert Hall really IS a dream and everything else as well.
5,From a Broadway Lover: THIS IS THE SOUNDTRACK!,"This is no doubt the BEST recording of Les Miserables. It only took three days for me to receive it but it felt like an eternity. When i saw it on Brodway i thuoght that the recording couldn't be any better but it was ! All of the performers gave knock out performances. Lea Salonga is a personal favorite of mine but everyone gave the perfermance of a lifetime! I only wish i could have been at the actual performance from which this was recorded! The only thing that rather annoyed me was the baloon popping during ""castle on a cloud"", my fav. song from this besides ""one day more"". a terrific musical, you should buy the CD today!"
5,Les Miserables 10th Anniversary Concert,Would be glad to write a review. Getting worried as I haven't received it yet. Maybe someone could ck this out for me.
4,amazing,"Saw the musical live in london, loved this 10th anniversary cast, and love this live recording! The sound is clear, the voices are great, and the shipment arrived speedily and in good shape!"
1,Les Miserables 10th Anniversary,"Page listed song title 1 - 19 all stating ""Les Miserable"".No columns to ""click"" for sampling the music, therefore, I was unable access the music. Very disappointing."
5,Les miz: still the best,"the best recording i have ever heard! Super! eryone was great. colm wilkonsin (valjean)~is valjean! great acting!phillip quast (javert)~ has a wonderful voice, and acting abilityjudy kuhn (cosette)~ is one of the best actress i've ever seen! great singing and acting ms. kuhn! :)ruthie henshall (fantine)~ is a delicate & beautiful fantine, but has a great acting ability, and good singing!michael ball (marius)~ is as convicing as ever as marius!lea salonga (eponine)~ incredible and beautiful singing plus wonderful acting as eponine!alun armstrong & jenny galloway (thenardiers)~ cooky, outrageous, and hilarous are just some of the words to describe these innkeepers!michael maguire (enjrolas) great acting and a wonderful voice!and everyone else like adam searles (gavroche) hannah chick (young cosette) and anthony crivello (grantaire) wonderful and superb, bravo bravo!"
3,eponine...,"sigh. lea salonga indeed DOES have a gorgeous voice.. but where is the character eponine? i don't care what you guys think - frances ruffelle IS eponine. lea's voice is too precise for the part, and her enunciation in on my own really bothers me. (and-when-i-lose-my-way) she sounds like she is shouting. frances' version has the passion that eponine needs, besides, lea isn't much of a belter. and eponine's part is basically belting! sure frances' voice isn't crystal clear - but that isn't eponine's character. just compare the OMO's... who sounds more like she is in misery, and desperate? frances. i highly recommend the original london cast, or the original broadway cast (esp. if eponine is your favorite character)"
2,Not a glass front!,"I ordered two of these. The first one had a slight ding in the wood, but it was a present and I had to get it out, so I used a bit of black shoe polish to cover it up. Neither of them had glass fronts. They were both plastic! I was really hoping for a nice glass front, as advertised. I guess I shouldn't have expected it with this price. Matting is nice and it looks nice enough. Just upset about the false advertising."
4,Good Book,"For all those Rifts fans out there, this book is the first of a series that lets you delve into the theme of one of your favorite RPGs.Although the book definately needed to hit a second editer (the Author should definately look into getting a spellcheck program on his computer) But spelling errors aside, I enjoyed this book so much that I went out and ordered the day one once I finished it.The book has a broad cast of colorful characters that insure that there is a favorite character for any reader. Delving into the rifts mindset, roleplayers may find new idea's and more understanding of how the rifts themed world works."
3,Boom almost bust,"Adam Chilson's first novel, Sonic Boom, is a must-have for all Rifts fans. Unfortunately, it's also a must-have for all copy editors, as it's what NOT to do when editing a book.I had to deduct a whole two stars for the horrible and sloppy editing of the book, with all the spelling errors, fractured sentences, and misplaced words.On the plus side, anyone who loves Rifts will enjoy the look into the Coalition States and the translation of the rules into a readable story.The book also boosts a promising start into an exciting series and with many excellent and varied characters."
4,Still An Excellent Book,"As any Rifts fan will tell you this book is a must have. What I would like to say is dont let the editng fool you. Once you have pushed your way through this title and on to the next in the series, you will be glad you did. The editing mistakes that are apparent in this title was due to a computer snafu at the printers (so it is said) and much editing was lost when this book went to print.I still say this was an excellent book. The characters are true to the Rifts world and will bring new ideas to your game. read this and the other two in the series and you will not be disappointed."
5,American made and SAFE,"Both of my kids have been in the Companion. We chose it because it was the ONLY car seat that wasn't some junk made in China. Britax seats are the only American made car seats out there. Trust me, I looked. As a bonus, they are one of the safest. The companion is a bit heavier than others but that's why it can hold bigger and heavier children than the other brands. The side impact protection is an awesome feature. Everyone is amazed when they see it. Luckily we have not had to test it out yet.We liked it so much, we have a Britax Boulevard for the eldest. We will be getting another Britax as the youngest out grows the Companion."
4,Great Car Seat,"I really like this car seat. The head rest especially. It really holds a newborns head in place. It does get in the way a little when you are putting the straps on the baby's arms, but not enough to not love the car seat. I especially love the color for my little girl. All the pink car seats seem to get really dirty quickly. This color hides all the stains. The five point harness is also an easy way to put the baby in and out. It is very easy to get in and out of the base. I really recommend this car seat."
5,"The album Sting, Peter Gabriel and Paul Simon have dreamt...","...of making, but never been able to. This is just an unbelievable album...You will probably have not heard anything like it. Salsa with bagpipes, flamenco guitars and Andean flutes, among others. What Ruben started out on Tiempos was definitely accomplished here. Standouts here are Sebastian, Parao, and Primogenio, although, this album just makes perfect sense and flow, even through all the different instruments. I always wondered how this album would sound live. Luckily, Ruben came to DC last year, where I saw him, and it was even better...This is a great album, and it is a travesty that people are still ripping on him for not ""playing salsa"". If salsa sounded like Mundo, I would throw out all my other music. Keep it up Ruben, you've found it!"
3,"heavy duty photo protectors, not for letter-sized pages","I was attempting to use these to hold pages containing my snack & drink prices for my coffee shop. I have them velcroed to to the side of my counter top. We used to use one of those menu boards with changeable letters, but letters kept falling off. Only problem is these aren't meant for a complete letter0-sized sheet of paper. I just had to cut a bit off one side of the page and they fit. They are heavy duty, and they're clear so contents shine through."
1,Confusion,"I was just wondering how this headset is being advertised as being compatible with the blackberry pearl 8100 and the curve 8300 when they both have different audio port sizes. The Blackberry Pearl carries a 2.5mm (which upon investigation is realised is what this headset carries), while the Blackberry Curve carries a 3.5mm headphone jack port. Is it equipped with an adapter (such not stated), even so, why would I buy a headset to use an adapter when 3.5mm headsets are available?"
4,Good replacement,"Needed replacement of glass jar for old, slightly warped clover-top Oster blender. This replacement works great, fits very snugly at the top, and screws tight at the bottom. Product was new, clean, and packaged well. The only minor gripe I have is that the base doesn't quite fit perfectly so it's a bit tight and minimally tilted. This does not affect it's function at all."
4,A vast jigsaw puzzle where something important happens,"A rude and violent book of Burroughs which make think of Naked Lunch in the really violent moments with huge explosions and international conspirations. But this book is really hardcore and well done in the sense that it is the third book of the trilogy composed of Cities of the Red Night, Dead Roads. This book is the way to the land of the deads which is a difficult road with various cut-ups and flash forward. It is in a sense the new mythology for the electronic area, Burroughs imagine what it would be like if the pharaos lived in the subliminal electronic age, what humanity would be if the great moments of the world history where trapped with this sort of plot.In the same time Burroughs create a new piece to assemble in his huge jigsaw puzzle, where secret agents mixed with Egyptian mythology, and where the symbolic discovered by the pharaos was a key to the new symbolic interpretation of our times."
3,"Maggie is good, but the other stories lack intrest","This collection contains Maggie, a story that captures realism at its finest. It is short, but powerful. ""The Open Boat,"" is an autobiograpical account of a ship wreck, that would lead to Crane contracting tuberculosis. This short story was BORING! I recommend that one reads Maggie and saves the rest of the book for a blizzard to read."
2,Less than advertised,"I have almost 100 Criterion titles, and that's the ONLY reason I picked this up.The film's sexuality was likely avant in the 60s, but it's very tame by today's standards. Additionally, by the time one wades through the cloying mire of Socialist/Communist platitudes, it barely matters because one is so bored that it's hard to pay attention. This is NOT a film of a young woman discovering her sexuality: it's four hours of anti-America prosetlyzing."
4,Brillant DVD edition for a not that worth film,"I didn't understand this film (or two films) very well, and I don't think I need to...A slight waste of time on this, but the DVD making is incredible. HD transfer with full-length documentary and interviews. WOW! Treat more classics like this, OK?"
5,just plain awesome,"this is personally one of my favorite planes ever to roll out of the factories at BAE Systems and i immediately purchased this model. I loved the model not only for the accuracy and durability of it, but also the fact that my father used to fly them in the U.S. Marine Corps. I was astonished to find out that the decals are from a real Marine squadron (the very same one my father used to fly for) based in cherry point, NC called the VMAT 223 Bulldogs. i would highly recommend this iconic Marine aircraft."
1,DOA: DOn't buy it,I had the exact same experience as Tom. The pole doesn't fit in the base and there were NO SCREWS in the box. Unlike Tom I am not handy and will not file it down to make it fit. Nor will I go out to buy small screws. It is DOA
3,A good release for all doom fans...,"This is a good, middle-of-the-read doomy, deathy release. Good vocals, lyrics and guitars make for a pleasent if slightly forgettable release.Tracks such as ""Depression"", ""The Chill From Within"" and ""Tears"" make for solid, foot-tapping doom styled metal. As per most Metal Blade releases the booklet is cool and the lyrics printed as well.No, this won't scrape the walls of time with it's classic nature but it's worthy for all doom fans to pick up. It's almost too bad as these guys really showed some potential on this release."
1,No good,not sure why anyone watches this stuff. They sound like a bunch of high school girls. Not recommended for anyone with a sense of reality.
1,quality was terrible!,"I got a refund... couldn't watch it, this version was not offered in hd. But it was a smooth and easy refund... they credited my account in about twenty minutes."
3,The Game,"The game was very good, but all the characters are the same that they usually are. No diversity of characters and the sides you could choose from were all dark aspects"
5,Doomy gloomy,"Yeah, after Morbid Angel's ""Altars Of Madness"" they decide to create chaos in a more laid back fashion - slower yet heavier but just as deadly and gloomy. This CD has better sound quality than their debut and a more doom death feel to it along with being a lot gloomier. Yet they still retain their typical Morbid Angel chaos with typical blast beats without using them, and displaying the wicked guitar skills of Trey, and the deeper and more growly vocals from David - the vocals are more deeper and more demonic compared to the more ""possessed"" sound in Altars. This is probably my favorite album by these guys. If you're into Morbid Angel, this is a must have following their debut."
4,Very Epic death metal,"When i first heard this masterwork death metal Lp back in middle school, it didn't really grab my attention as i was just getting into death metal. I was more into bands like Deicide, Cannibal Corpse, and Dying Fetus(more strait foward death metal)and the depth and complexity of an album like ""blessed are the sick"" was a bit hard for my virgin ears to comprehend at the time. But like a good scotch or wine, this will grow on you over time. Morbid Angel have a style of death metal that is more deep and meaningful than your average ""gore death kill"" death metal bands. If you like Morbid Angel and don't have this album yet, your missing out."
1,It doesn't do it for me,This film doesn't do it for me. Except for Kelly Ripa who was wonderful in her role. The film was very self indulgent.
2,Historical Fiction,"Though David Pogue offers an intreaguing story, this book has become completely outdated and should only be read with an open mind: I found it helpful to think of it as a ""history"" book on computers. The author obviously knows Macs - or knew them - but has zero literary style, and the story line has become somewhat outdated as well (do we become frantic when a virus gets on the ""InterNet,"" as he calls it, now? In the book they did).An easy, breezy read to be taken with a grain of salt and lots of patience."
5,The book is excellent reading!!,"I have read the book more than once, and i found the book to be very entertaining and enthralling. I myself being a mac enthusiast and an amateur programmer, the book most deffinitely appealed to me."
5,murray is a good writer,how about some sick humor.i am going to write my own book on custer.he flunks west point and nothing is ever heard from him again.
2,Mizani Therma Strength,I didn't find this product to be that great. I would not be repurchasing this. I did love the smell ... very much like a perfume.
4,Like It.,"Sturdy, easy to expand and contract. I think my only gripe about this would be it doesn't look particularly classy, but if it's functionality you're after, you can't go wrong. Expanded to it's largest size, it fits 12 pairs of my size 10.5 men's shoes. Easy enough to construct as well, probably took me 5-10 minutes. I've had it for roughly 3 months or so now, no problems."
5,Top Notch Thriller,"Michael Slade just keeps getting better and better. Can't wait for the next installment in the fight between DeClercq and arch villian, Mephisto. It is bloody and sadistic, but that is the nature of the villian -- someone who knows no restrait in his desire for the ultimate pleasure and we don't know yet what that is. You can see Mephisto going deeper and deeper into evil and DeClercq and crew doing their best to stop him. Couldn't put down and rates five stars (I normally don't give more than four)."
2,Disappointing,"This was the first book I read by Slade, and I was surprised how amatuerish it was, being their tenth book. There was a considerable amount of research put into this book, and it was appreciated, but it's no substitute for good storytelling. A good story should draw you in, making you feel like a part of what's going on. Slade makes you feel that you're being told about something they experienced themselves, and the occasional personal opinions they throw in only only pull you farther away. They draw heavily from Stephen King, but they should leave it to those who do it well. Allusions are made only to have them immediately explained in detail. Slade must think we're ignoramuses! They also kept beating us over the head with the idea of how important beauty is in Hollywood. Enough already! We get it! We were aware of it long before Death's Door was written!"
2,I really didn't get it.,"This thriller/horror novel begins with a stolen Mummy and ends with an archfiend serial killer. How it gets from point A to point B is unclear, and at least a little bit uninteresting._Death's Door_ seems to me as though the goal of the writer was to become known for the most gory and graphic set of serial killers on record. In this, Slade succeeds admirably-- the abominations range from particularly nasty snuff to child torture to necrophilia-- all in a mere 368 pages.Unfortunately, the book is less successful in creating coherent characterization or plot. I never fully got the Special X thing, and the serial killer is so over-the-top bad he brought Boris Badinoff to mind more quickly than Hannibal Lector. And as for a good explanation of the whole Mummy thing? Forget it. It never arrives._Death's Door_ will probably succeed in keeping you awake while waiting for a delayed bus at a Greyhound station, but I would suggest that you pick it up second-hand."
3,Gymnastics: Tumbling: How to do a Better Back-Handspring,Was a little too heavy on the conditioning aspect and not enough on the actual technique needed for back handsprings.
3,Must have some background in music or it's gibberish,"Duckworth is not a very good writer of educational texts. I was able to follow it fairly well, but this was a textbook for an introductory class, and much of the material is poorly explained, with an assumption that the reader, whom he seems to intend to be a beginner, knows more than they probably do. I found this textbook to be needlessly challenging for the wrong reasons. It is fairly useful, but my professor even hated using this book for an introductory course (the department selected it for her). If you are in step with a lot of music fundamentals, it should help you advance much farther; however, if you are not,, this book will seriously confuse you."
3,"Cute book, photos could be better","This book is a great size for little hands, and my little one loves looking at the pictures of babies. However, as someone who enjoys photography (but is purely an amateur at best!), I have to say the photos were not the greatest. They are obviously snapshots, with not a ton of concern for position, lighting or background. I'm glad the feature real children doing real activities but better quality photos would improve this book."
5,Great Mexican Cookbook,"We love Mad Coyote Joe's Chicken Tacos! The sauce, Mad Coyote Joe suggests, is so good, but it does not have a long staying power. Last time I made only half a batch for a double batch of chicken tacos. This recipe book is very good!"
4,Great puzzle but the wood is unfinished,"I solved a similar wooden cube puzzle at a friends house. It was purchased elsewhere and made by a different manufacturer. Regardless, I wanted to add this specific wooden puzzle to my collection. While I love the design and the challenge of this puzzle, I was a little dismayed to find the wood pieces themselves are unfinished. What I mean is, there is no veneer or polish or laminate on the pieces whatsoever. It is naked wood. I can imagine that if any sort of liquid or residue were to get on this puzzle it would soak right in. Be warned. Besides that, and it's rough edges, I still enjoyed it. It does have a low price for a wooden puzzle, so I don't mind so much."
1,MAY be replacement for old style. Won't work for New Style handle,"I uploaded a picture of what was sent me. The official picture is of a new style handle with a round hole. What was sent was the old style handle which has a hex hole for the tip and a sliding pressure controller on the handle.If you need a replacement for an old style handle then I assume this will work for you. But if you only have a button on the handle and the hole for your tip is circular not hexagonal, then this will not work.Again, when I ordered a picture of a handle with a blue button was displayed. This picture ought to be removed as it is inaccurate. I am guessing that Goodman has so many products that the wrong picture just slipped through. My order did include tubing, an old style handle and the angle piece that connects to the base.I gave this one star because it was clearly not what was displayed in the picture."
1,wrong size handle,Most water pics have a round pic. I was sent one with six sides and it requires a different design. I does not work with the round pics.
5,This one saved me money!,"I was able to repair my Waterpik with thei repair kit. I had a little difficualty putting the insert that connects the tubes into my tube. It never inserted in fully like it should without splitting the tube and had to use a file to thin it down a little to get it in and secure the connection with super glue, but after that It works excellent and did save me the cost of buying a new waterpik so I am stillk giving it 5 stars! :)"
5,Excellent materials,This book is the perfect book for a beginner or he expirenced CAD operator. I recommend this book to anyone who is trying to learn AutoCAD.
5,Silvertide is my and my daughter's favorite band!,"I love, love, love this CD! I have seen their show on three occassions and will see any new tours they will be having. The music is upbeat and the lyrics are clever and provacative. I have the edited version so my 4-year-old daughter can listen with me, and everytime we are in the car, she wants to hear ""Heartstrong"" and ""Ain't Coming Home."" For the guitar enthusiast, listen to ""SFC""! There are parts of that song where the lead guitarist Nick Perri is reminiscent of Jimi Hendrix. You will not be disappointed if you buy this album. Check out their website Silvertidemusic.com for new releases, news, and upcoming shows in your neighborhood. Thanks for listening!"
5,Good Old Fashion Rock N' Roll,"Never have I heard such a catchy and talented band. I'm listening to Silvertide's new cd on AOL right now, and I have to say...It's going to become one of my faves. Silvertide takes what made rock n' roll so rebellious and make their own. I really like the lead singer's vocals, he's got such charisma in his voice that it makes you feel everything he's singing. The musicianship in this band is so rockin'. Awesome guitar solos piled on top of a steady barriage of sound. Great melodies and it's extremely catchy. ROCK ON!"
3,not bad,this band has everything i like in rock n roll but the cd didnt knock my socks off. not sure if its the production or the lyrics but it never made rotation in my cd player.they will be great if their record label gives them time to experience things worth singing about.
5,Wicked Rock!,"More younger bands should take these guys as an example of how music should be!!! I saw them open for Van Halen in Toronto. Amazing energy... blew me away, they were smokin'!! I hope they're not dicks as individuals."
5,Rock and Roll is Back,The other reviews say it all. Silvertide is the real deal. They have the attitude and passion that all the great rock bands seem to have. The only thing better than their music is their live performances. Check them out if you get the chance. You won't be disappointed.
3,Mixed blessing,"It's nice the have the original mixes and all, but this has obviously been mastered from damaged tapes. It's particularly apparent on Am I Evil; the high end whooshes up and down like a cassette that was left out in the sun. I'm not crazy about the ""white album"" cover ""art"", either."
5,A woman of courage and strength...,This has been a staple gift that I always keep in my mind when trying to get a present for a woman of courage and strength. It's an elegant box of cards/book that I discovered in the 1990's and my box (now devoid of the cards) has served as a safety box for important things.
4,spaghetti measurer,I purchased this item to see help me measure spaghetti. The device was a little confusing to understand. Wasn't sure if the measurer was in cups or people. But it is a nice gift.
2,So So Performance,"OK performance, but def not his funniest. This is an earlier show and I prefer his harder line that he drew from later in his career."
5,"Hot, Hot, and did I mention Hot?","Those familiar with Changeling Press already know this book is a scorcher. For those unfamiliar with Changeling Press's fantastically erotic e-books, let me just say, they have made the transition to print with stories that will blow your pants off. I loved it! It features vamps, fairies, elves, trolls, and more to satisfy your paranormal cravings! And with authors like Angela Knight, Kate Douglas, Shelby Morgen, and the rest, you can't go wrong. The only bad choice you could make is to NOT buy it! Definitely 5 stars from this reviewer."
2,This is PLASTIC not porcelain!,"I thought I was getting a lovely porcelain pitcher, probably with some kind of liner for insulation. Instead it is plastic with a thermal glass liner.And the editor who said it was dishwasher and microwave proof did not read the instructions.It is a pretty thermos..but overpriced. It would have been a real deal if it was porcelain."
4,Rebuttal to Prior Review of the iPaq AC Adapter,"The above review is inaccurate. Although I am pleased with the iPaq adapter, the review infers that the Casio adapter is substandard, i.e., it continues to charge and creates a fire hazard. I have check with both Casio & Compaq technical support, and both unequivocably state that the switching mechanism for charging is not within the charger itself, but within the Pocket PC. As such, in this situation both chargers are equal. For the record, both the Casio and iPaq adpaters are electrically rated the same, i.e., DC Output 5v, 2 AMP, centerpole +."
4,For the voyeur.,"I will tell it like it is. This DVD is for those who want to see what's going on in the locker room. Hot models taking off their clothes, taking showers and some innocent horseplay. That's about it. I enjoyed it."
2,Not great,"I was really disappointed by this book! I had very high expectations after ""Room on the Broom"" and it definitely didn't meet them. The rhyming isn't clever and the story isn't original. The illustrations are great though."
3,Beware The Darts,"Overall, the dartboard is decent for the money. It's not a $95 professional board, but it didn't cost $95. The darts, on the other hand, are garbage. Better off buying a different board without darts and buy good darts seperately.I'm dismayed at amazon's packaging - the board (in it's box) was fairly loose in shipping box - just a little packing paper stuffed into large box, so much so that one of the cheap plastic dart ends broke off from the banging around. It also appears that the board set was previously returned and then sold to me. Unfortunately Amazon only allows complete return of entire item and there doesn't seem to be any customer service people to talk with. I'd rather they give me a discount on a new set of decent darts than go through the hassle of returning board for exchange. Not worth it"
4,8=My faviote VCA series!,"I have been reading V.C.Andrews since I was 12. I've read many of her books,but the series I like best was the Landry Series. When I read it I felt like I been to the places and known the charicters for a long time. I like the charicters in the series and felt like they were my friends. If you want to read a VCA book you can love I recomend this book"
2,I did not like it,It was really cute but it did not fit my little boy very well. I got the 18 month size for my son who was about 12 months old at the time and it was to short and the snaps around his chest pulled. If you order this get a much-much-much larger size for your child.
5,Mary Jane Clark has performed a master-stroke!,"Mary Jane Clark has cooked up a wonderful blend of suspense and adrenaline in this, her first novel.. you'd think she was an old pro after the surprise ending!Eliza Blake is a sympathetic, endearing heroine in a hectic world of broadcast news. Clark's hawk-eye attention to detail allows us all a peak into the sometimes ugly world of TV news. So, it's a double whammy...a good mystery (be prepared to stay up through the night to finish it!) and a great behind-the-scenes tell-all. READ THIS BOOK! You will NOT regret it!"
4,"Visually rich, good acting, nice twist at the end","NO SPOILERS HERE: This is a shorter film than most and is without a gripping plot, but I was captivated by the acting and the visual richness. There are a few interwoven story lines. If you are interested in restaurants and/or cooking, food and restaurant trends, or just the type of films that have more character exploration than action, you will enjoy this one. The actor who played an art critic taking some artists and hangers on to dinner was so effective at his role that I felt uncomfortable watching him. I had an idea of how it would end and was right, but that didn't spoil it for me. Too bad Hollywood never makes sequels to good films like this one - the various story lines leave lots of possibilities."
3,Somewhat Good with a few Annoying Characters,"I wanted to like this film, but there were too many characters that were one-note pieces of cardboard and some that were overly annoying. For the latter, the older guy who complains about everything (waiting for a table, wine, paintings on the wall, etc.) was the worst. I also don't care for the Geico guy -- the baby-faced mobster who wants to take over the restaurant with his fat brother-in-law. A Aiello gave a great performance as do others, but the bland and annoying characters were to much to overcome."
2,Apple Corer/Slicer,"I would only give this item 2 stars. It looks and feels like a quality product, but the blade keeps falling out of the handle and it's a pain to get it back in. I never use it anymore."
2,Not that good,"""The Banquo Legacy"" suffers by obviously being a non-Doctor Who novel with Doctor Who grafted onto it. A typical, almost cliched gothic mystery is given a few SF motifs, and a very trite explanation is given for the Doctor and Fitz's involvement (Compassion is almost a non-player).Not the worst EDA, but it does manage to mark time until the next novel, the end of the Faction Paradox cycle."
4,Good spy novels aren't dead; read this one!,"Set against the backdrop of The Game in which the U.K. and the Soviet Union strive to influence India's future, this historical espionage novel is a terrific read. The story is a good one, the writing better than usual and the detail and ambience superb."
5,"""Celestine Prophecy"" meets Kerouac's ""On the Road""","From the moment I began reading ""The New Lane"" I couldn't put it down. Codey's vision of the World Trade Center as described in the first chapter is truly transcendental and only heightened the mystery for me about what was to come next in the book.Codey then takes you through a magical journey of synchronicity that is reminiscent of James Redfield's best selling ""Celestine Prophecy"" books. He even recounts to the reader the synchronous events that occur as he is in the process of writing the book. It all comes to a crashing, heart rending crescendo at the end of the book, with the events of 9-11 and the amazing discovery of how Codey's ""The New Lane"" relates to the writing of the classic American author, Jack Kerouac.This is the most fascinating book I've read in years."
5,No longer hate weighing myself...,"Trying to lose weight and wanted a sleek scale to match my bathroom- this is perfect! It's sturdy, seems accurate, and looks nice!"
4,Basic scale for weighing each day,"This is an excellent scale with both standards of measurement. Kilo/English. I like the metric setting, but it weighs accurately in either mode. Easy to see the numbers even without my glasses on--blinks when the weight has settled down which requires a few seconds to do so. Recommend the scale to people who can not have a ""fat"" weighing scale because of havng a pacemaker."
5,Taylor 7506 Precision Tech Scale,"Works great. If one gets off and on to try its reliability, the same numbers come up each time. I have no complaints. I would recommend this scale to others."
2,did not last long,It was pretty good and reasonably accurate for as long as it worked. But within less than a year it went bad. For no good reason it suddenly shows a completely wrong weight. I'm tired of fancy looking products that don't last.
2,Don't buy it!,"I bought this just over a year ago & now it doesn't work. Tried replacing the battery - didn't fix issue. Scale started showing lower and lower numbers (which would have been nice if I'd been really losing the weight), then wouldn't register at all. Now it shows 0.0 when you step on it and when you step off it starts showing 350 + lbs and rising... My last scale lasted more than 10 years and only had to be replaced when a heavy object dropped on it. Very disappointed."
5,Scales,"I have had a lot of complements on the scale, that works just fine. Everyone that comes over has to try it out."
5,Outstanding accuracy!,"We bought this scale to replace an old digital model (not a Taylor product) we've had for years. We knew the old one was not giving an accurate reading and wanted to get something better. After reading reviews in a well-known consumer magazine we chose this top-rated scale. This also happened to be one of the best values with regard to the price. We received the scale quickly, actually a day before we expected it (Great job Amazon!) and immediately tried it out. It is easy to use - no tap of the foot, just get on. What is even more impressive is the accuracy. We checked our weight right before we would be weighed on a calibrated scale. We found with great pleasure that the new Taylor scale and the calibrated scale had given the exact same reading.We highly recommend this scale to anyone interested in finding out exactly how much they weigh."
2,Not a constant weight,"Arrived timely and not a bad price. Looks great. Problem, the weight can change within 5 minutes. Not just a few ounces but sometimes a whole pound. Not consistent at all."
1,Glass arrived shattered at delivery,"I called Taylor's 800 # and was on hold for 30+ minutes. Then in despair I left a message.They never replied. To further complicate the issue,Amazon sent item without a package slip!"
4,It's a scale,"I don't have another scale to compare this too so I'm not sure if my review will be helpful. But, it seems accurate and I like the big digital read out."
5,A Great and accurate scale,I have compared this scale to 2 other scales I know to be calibrated and accurate and it is spot on every time. I like the step on feature and it has a simple design that is easy to clean and the larger numbers make it easy to read. A great scale all around!
5,Taylor 7506 Weight Scale,The design was unexpected for a bathroom scale - it is a beautiful work of design. The large digital display makes it easy to read.
5,Cheap and Awesome,"I bought this scale for its look and its price and also because I needed it.It arrived on time, and it's just like the description of it.Measures are accurate and it works fine all of the time. All of my family uses it, and everyone loves it."
1,junk in 3 months,"Bought this in Oct 2011. It's now Jan 2012 and this thing is apparently landfill. Great looking and worked well till the display started to go psycho. Replaced the battery but no change. Handled and did as the instructions say but no change. I could return to Amazon but since it's over 30 days, I only get a partial refund and get to pay shipping, which isn't cheap however you go. Not worth messing with for the few bucks I'll get back. So it's trash. Lots of reviews, many are happy with it but a fair percentage aren't. Beware."
2,Lots of hysteresis and random fluctuation,"My weight as displayed on my old Taylor weight scale has a huge random component to its output. I weight 155.0, for example. However, if I weigh myself 1 minute later, then I noticed that the weight has CHANGED! Also, if I stand on the scale with a 25lbs. weight, and then re-weigh myself, my new weight is now different at ~156.2. Finally, suppose that I drank exactly a pound of water, which is a pint. Now, my weight on the scale is still 155.0. Therefore, for the most accurate weight, you must average the last 3 days of weights, and have your weight measured at the same time each morning, and under the same conditions (i.e. after going to the bathroom, before eating breakfast).I'm rating this product 2* because of this random fluctuation, as well as my fat-percent never working for me. Finally, my device only lasted 3 years, and the CR 2043 batter didn't last long towards the end."
2,Broken After One Year,"It looks great. It worked great for about one year, then stopped. I replaced the battery, but I either get an error message or a 0.0 result. The price is not too high, but I really think a product should work for more than one year."
2,Doesn't respond to tenths...why does it read in tenths?,"We just got this Taylor 7506 for the shop to do a Biggest Looser event after the Holidays. I tested it out by using .435 pound weights that I had lying around. The reading on the scale never changed with me adding one of the weights to my own. Still no change when I got back on holding (2) of the weights in hand(.87 pounds). Finally, I went back on holding 1.3 pounds, then the scale showed it. I continued to keep adding weights and the same thing continued. This scale does not register until you change your weight by more than a pound. So, why the tenths position??? I went up to (7) of the weights (3 pounds), and then reversed the procedure. The same thing carried on, except I never got back to my original weight, with no weights in hand. I was now 1.2 pounds heavier than when I started. Not a very accurate scale."
1,Very Disappointed Item Doesn't Work,"Purchased this scale based on the recommendation of Consumer Reports. Ordered last Thursday and arrived today (Wednesday). Set up scale in accordance with the included instructions. Every time you weigh it gives a 00 reading. Went to Tayor's web sight and found no help there, just a copy of the same instuctions included in the box. After hours so was unable to talk to customer service. Have requested RMA and refund. Recommend you choose another brand."
5,terrific scale for a small price,"I purchased this scale based on a Consumer Reports recommendation: it got high marks and is among the least expenseive that I researched. An added plus for me is that because of its glass-topped platform, it doesn't appear to take up as much space in a small bathroom that an ordinary scale does. AND I can read the numbers without bending over and squinting!"
5,Bathroom scales,An excellent product at a very good price. My weight on this scale matches exactly my weight on my doctor's scale.
5,Sleek and effective,"This attractive scale goes well in any bathroom. Because I am trying to lose 10 pounds, I weigh myself daily. I enjoy using this scale. The numbers are big enough for me to see and the cool glass has a pleasant feel."
3,Scale stopped working after 1 year,"I bought this scale about a year ago because of its nice design and of course, functionality. It was working great for a while, but then it somehow became wobbly as one of the pegs became uneven. After that the scale stopped working completely. I changed the batteries and that didn't work, so now it's useless. It also gets really dirty, which is unfortunate, but I guess with a glass scale thats expected. It still looks nice and was great in the beginning. Maybe I just received a defect model."
1,SHOCK AND AWE,"Received this thing from Amazon in early July, 2012. I was replacing a scale that I had for about three years. This lasted 3 MONTHS. Talk about built-in-obsolescence! I am furious and don't know if I will ever pay attention to reviews that have been posted about anything I buy. What happened to quality control."
2,"Pretty, but not accurate.","I purchased this scale as a replacement for my old Tanita, which had worked well for 5 years and was accurate to .5 pounds. I recheck the scales with 2 physicians offices annually. Unfortunately, the Taylor measures 1.5 to 2 pounds heavy. It is at least consistent in weighing heavy, but I was disappointed that it was not accurately calibrated at the factory. It is also unfortunate there is no way to recalibrate the scale myself! I'm going back to Tanita..."
3,works for a while,"We bought 1 of these about 2 years ago, and we liked it so much we bought 2 more for family. after about a year and a half, it was time to replace batteries (so it seemed) for two of them. It turns out that one of the two was broken altogether, and the second just isn't the same after the new battery. If you think that getting a couple of years out of a scale is OK, this is a good scale."
5,Works VERY Well !,"Much more accurate than my old Taylor that this one replaces - I don't mind that there's no back-light, but it WOULD be nice touch.Make sure you have it on a level surface - or your readings will be off every weighing."
3,Every High School Grad Should Read this Book,"I think this book was poignant, and should be a high school's grad, last easy read. It helped me get over the high school graduation slump. It's so easy to get trapped into living off your parents money, and letting sexual relationships be your entire existence. It showed that even though this seems like an ideal way of living, it is an entirely futile lifestyle, and your better off just doing what is a more acceptable path, it's acceptable for a reason.I think people who are unattractive and not reasonably well-off, wouldn't understand how something like this could happen, but it happens all too often. Married People and Despairing Students seem to be two of a kind, and when they find each other they fill each other with hopeless and despairing intentions."
2,Bland competence,"2 1/2SE, and bands like Marillion in general, represents how somewhere along the line progressive rock morphed into mildly challenging adult contemporary."
4,Bottom Line: A Very Good Album,"It's quiet simple: Somewhere Else is not Marbles, and I guess it wasn't meant to be. Since I cannot expect and pretend for a band to repeat a formula that worked in the past, you shouldn't have waited for a marbles part II.Like any other reviewer said, this disc is a grower, it has fantastic songs on it and you should give it a try."
2,"""A Misplaced Childhood?""","this band is better than this latest effort. as a fan I come to expect more,instead its confusing why they are ""Clutching @ Straws""?and released this?"
5,Sabbath reborn,"sHeavy rocks. Period. Who cares if their detractors dis them because the lead singer sounds like the Godfather of Metal, Ozzy? That's why we LOVE it! If you like this album, you MUST buy Electric Sleep. They are wayyyyyyyyyyy better than any other stoner rock out there."
1,Could not finish...,"This book was rather dull and painful to read. I attempted to read this book while waiting for an appointment. Fortunately, I was called into my IRS audit before I was forced to read too much out of sheer boredom... The audit was FAR less painful than this book."
1,Should have known better,"I bought this phone in july 2010 for my mom. We are in March 2011 and already giving headaches. At first I was crazy over it and happy that mom liked it so much, but now I feel ashamed whenever she complains about it. It is still cute, but the back simply won't stay in place. No later than 2 days ago a tiny piece came out of it and she had to use nail tools to get it back in place. I am really wondering if I want to get her the same model again although she really like it."
3,Older stock ... caution!,"I could not detect until I tried to use the phone, a month after I received it. The phone battery was dead and it would not charge. I ended up buying another battery and the phone worked fine. Looks like older stock, so check it as soon as you get it."
1,Ordered an unlock world phone was sent T-Mobile phone instead,I ordered an unlocked world phione and was sent an unlocked T-mobile phone. It was loaded with T-mobile programs and I get a T-mobile text message every time I power up the phone. I am very displeased Amozon sent this phone when on their web site you could chose an unlocked world phone or the T-mobile unlocked phone; and I chose the unlocked world phone not an T-mobile phone
4,Not perfect - but closer than most,"I've had this phone for a month or so now. For the most part I like it; not sure what I would have gotten instead. It works nicely, has the features I need, and the audio quality is significantly better than any other phone I've had.A few notes:- One thing that hadn't occurred to me with the slider design: there's only one display, and it's color. I'm used to using my phone as a watch, but, with this one, I have to poke it to make it turn on the backlight. For this reason alone, my next phone might be a clamshell.- The vibrator is wimpy, to the point that I miss calls sometimes.- The battery indicator is screwy - the battery is always completely full until it's empty.- Getting it configured to work with my carrier (I think they're called ATT this week) was more work than I had expected. Non-technonerd people are likely to need help to get things like web browsing or GPRS working.Overall it's a great phone, though."
2,Blaine is a disgrace,"Ok, I am a magician, and I have to say david blaine is the WORST magician today. Many laypeople think he is so ""amazing"". When you talk about magic the first thing they think of is David Blaine. A lot of people have heard of him, but have never heard of GREAT magicians like David Copperfield and Jay Sankey. The truth about David Blaine is this:David Blaine dosn't make his own magic. He goes into a magic shop, buys something, and does it on the street. David COPPERFIELD, makes his own magic, and sooooo many laypeople havn't even heard of him! And the truth about the levitation is that he does the balduci levitation, but then edits the video to make it look like both his feet are lifing 4 feet off the ground! He also hires stooges. For some tricks where the card appears in someone shoes, the people are hired."
5,David Blaine is Fearless as advertised,"This move is fascinating. Some of David Blaine's magic you may have seen elsewhere but some of it is simply astonishing. I don't want to give away any of the specifics but this is a movie you'll find yourself ""rewinding"" to watch something one more time to try to figure out, ""How can he do that?!"". But, that's only 1/2 of his story - the rest is in his tests of human endurance and finding the boundaries of what he can do. Between this movie and one other, we see him perform these feats - he buries himself alive, he stays entombed in ice for days on end, and stands 10 stories above ground for a couple of days with no food, no water - simply perched on a platform that looked to be, at most, 2' x 2'. Amazing. I loved it."
3,"Ambitious, but ultimately disappointing","The author has spent admirable energy collecting images, interviews, and historical data. But she has been ill-served by her editor and publisher. The text and images are made incoherent by not having been shaped, as if the author's note cards had spilled on to the page in no particular order (a simple chronological narrative might have been best). Sadly, the result is a book about beauty that is not beautiful. The publisher seems not to have hired a book designer; the images neither flow esthetically nor relate integrally to the text. Even the index shows lack of care for the material, with the font unadjusted to distinguish between pages with images and those containing only text. Black beauty deserves better than this. And yet, since this is the only book of its kind, it is still worth buying... It is a joy to see these fantastic women all in one place. Kudos to Barbara Summers for introducing them to each other and to us."
3,burns out,"i bought this flat iron because i ahve very thinck, wavy course hair. I had to heat it on 25 to straighten my hair and it worked great, for about 4-5 months, then it burned out.My old flat irons were more expensive but lasted over a year.It made me mad that it burned out so easily considering i didnt use it every day."
1,You should read the book!,"For Don Quixote in particular, no condensed version or outline will suffice. The original material is too rich to capture in this format."
4,The pictured product is what we got,"These chairs look exactly as pictured and are well built.The instructions for assembly were clear, however, there wereno instructions for cleaning the seat. I had to go to the website ofthe maunfacturer to find cleaning instructions.I would recommend spraying the seats several times with scotch guard,but be sure to wipe the excess off of the medal.Good value for the price."
3,This could have been better thought out..,"I have purchased this grill cover to enhanced the look of my Titan but sometimes you have to give up top quality to have a better price. This is grill cover could have been better designed but maybe it would have cost more, now to me this still a bit too expensive for what you really get. The polish quality of the front is good and clean now you have to vend the grill a bit in order to fit perfectly. The mounting hardware is cheap and not very well designed, I had to buy my own mounting hardware because the one that was provided was not easy to fit and the where the securing holes go do not secure the grill cover firmly. after installation the look of it is not exactly as depicted in the picture because you can tell where the mounting screws are but it may not be a big deal. For now I will keep it on my truck but I will be replacing them in the future for something a little more professional."
3,Also mislead by the color,"I am giving this item 3 stars just because of the price drop. I ordered this for my 18 year old son for christmas. The picture is black, what I receieved is white. Too late to return and order another one for Christmas. I will give it to him on Christmas, but it may yet be turned. I can not comment on ease of use or sound quality yet, but I will update this review with the outcome after Christmas. Just beware if the color is important."
2,"OK, its not just me, this book lacks heart and wit","I have to agree with the other reviewers who say this is NOT Goldsmith. The very first part, maybe, her interaction with the little boy. I thought that she was setting Kate up for a fall like in Pen Pals to make her a better human. Also I miss the humor--making fun of the provincial Brookyln folks and gays but not seeing the absurdities and humor in Manhattan? ""And Barbara Pym. A British author she and Elliot both reread frequently, was one of her secret addictions."" What the #$%& ?? I can't see either of these quasi-hipsters sitting down with a copy of ""Some Tame Gazelle."" Better they read Dorothy Parker. Even better the real author of this book read Parker.To quote Miss Parker--This is not a novel to be tossed aside lightly. It should be thrown with great force."
3,Where's the suspense?,"Right away you know the killer and the explanation for his crimes, so it is all very predictable."
5,Excelent Folk from a local guy,Jon Waterman is a local artist here in eastern Massachusetts. I've had the pleasure of seeing him perform many times and own both of his CD's. Taking the Fall (his first CD) is excelent. I'm not a big music afficionado so am not sure how to truly explain just what this CD is like. all I can really say is that if you are a fan of folk and are looking for something to enjoy you won't be disapointed.Remember that you are also helping to support a local artist. Jon has not been signed (although I don't know why) by any lable and creates these CD's from his own hard-earned money.Support your local rock star.
1,Lappo2025,"Was very disappointed with this purchase, must admit i bought it thinking it was similar to many of the cop series of the time. Unfortunately this disc was not episodes of the series was a movie length disc. Watched the footage for 20 minutes or so, and turned it off! I guess it was my mistake as i did not read the product information clearly, i guess i did not understaand what the Criterion Collection meant!"
1,amazon review,"The review says ""With a helicopter shot slowly closing in on Manhattan"". This was late 1940's...only the Germans used helicopters (during the end of the war) in the 1940s. Perhaps it was a Blimp (or airplane at slow speed), but I'd bet big money it was NOT a helicopter taking that shot of Manhattan."
5,*Really* Big Deal,"This book isn't just fun to read. It's actually useful - a healthy, realistic slap in the face to anybody who thinks it's easy to sell a script. The stories the author tells are both frightening and hilarious. The old moguls like Mayer and Goldwyn were infamous, but today's crew make them look like Einsteins. I teach college film courses, and there's always at least one student in each class who wants to be a screenwriter in Hollywood. Now I can recommend a very readable book of real-life case histories - one that spells out to them - from lots of industry insiders' perspectives - what the (big) deal really is."
5,Mois Dix Moi,"It is very good music, it's somewhat heavy. music is great, lyrics are very good too.. dues ex machina"" i know suffering isn't celestrial nor earthly but supreme santuary, origin of the imagination New life is born in this world ruled by choas.""it's a very good CD."
1,Wrong Symbol!!!!!,"First of all, I would like to say I have practiced the art of Wicca and Pagan my whole life I was raised up with it. As I look at this book called Wicca for Beginners, I see something that eats away at me. The star behind the title of the book is not the right star. Look very carefully and count the points on the star. Thats right there are six points. As every true Wiccan knows there are only five points on the Wiccan Symbol. I looked at the other reviews on this book and noticed that the book contains things pertaining tarot cards. All true Wiccan's should know that even the Tarot cards have the five pointed symbol. The six pointed star is know as the Satanic symbol. Know also for the animal head shape. (The Goat) I think the Author needs to go back and look deep within her self and truley figure out the religion known as Wicca!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Blessed Be and Merry Part."
4,EXCELLEN STRIPPER FILM,"This is an excellent stripper movie with the charming Lorissa McComas showing off er well endowed self. A great exotic dance scene by Kim Dawson too. Unfortunately, in my opinion the film is marred by having the male lead played as a blind guy; a dumb gimmick. Does he smell the girls as they do their routines or maybe he is turned on by the fine musical score. Catch the great fast editing in the dance numbers. Some of the cuts must be about five frames a second"
3,Yeah,"A good book, better than many others I have used, but as otherreviews describe, it contains many blaring errors. Its text is muchmore readable than other books I have used, though."
3,Beware,"I purchased the wood dartboard cabinet as a gift thinking that the actual dartboard came with it, and it did not. Make sure you purchase it together. When my brother opened his gift, it was empty inside- no dartboard!"
2,Light Weight in More Ways Than One,"The Bushnell Sentry 12-36 scope provides fair views at 12x in good light, but at higher power the eye relief diminishes rapidly and it becomes unusable to someone wearing glasses and difficult to use without glasses. I was looking for an easy to carry alternate for my 82mm Kowa scope. I intended to use it on a gunstock mount or monopod to get quick views of birds that were too far for my 10x binoculars. I did not find it suitable for this purpose. It comes with a very practical ""scope glove"", a soft case, and a hard case worthy of a much better instrument. Perhaps Bushnell would have a better product if they had omitted the hard case and spent the money to provide better optics."
1,Not worth the money,Not easy to use and not very well constructed. Knurled knob does not lock in very tight and is only good for about six inches.
2,Shockingly Stereotypical,"I value seeing such a candid view of bigotry. I have lived in poverty all of my life and never really understood being snobbed and disrespected by total strangers. Well, judging by what Ms. Payne has to write, I guess folks who are well-to-do assume that low moral character goes hand-in-hand with low financial resources."
1,Sad attempt,"This, hands down, has to be the worst example of bias I've had the misfortune to read. The author's use of stereotyping is apalling. How does one reach disadvantaged children? perhaps by listening and attempting to really learn about the childs community not relying on someones backwards, outdated views as a starting point. Her Cinderella story as told in the vernacular lacked authenticity and Opie and her mother Oprah as well as Vangie (her black subjects) would be well suited as characters in any number of racist tracts. How sad that someone who perhaps is well intentioned could have gotten things so very wrong. I suppose her work is geared towards those Whites who continue to accept Patriarchy and the status-quo as the only way...but perhaps by understanding their students as humans much the same as themselves they can really understand them."
5,Eye-opening,"This book opened my eyes to many issues I have had as an educator, and school-based speech-language pathologist, with parents not participating in meetings, students not completing homework, and attitudes in the classroom. I really feel as if I have a better understanding of poverty and the changes I needed to make in order to help students meet the expectations in my class language lessons and individual speech therapy sessions, that will hopefully carry over into all aspects of their lives."
4,Would you survive?,"I teach in the inner city, and a fellow teacher recommended this book after hearing me say that I didn't understand why the children in my class would never stop talking. Well, now I know why they talk constantly--and I might even have some idea of what to do about it. My favorite part of the book were the scenarios, which paint a grim picture of life in poverty, but aren't too far removed from what I see my students experiencing. It was interesting to see how the people in the scenarios would react, and compare it to the way that I would handle myself. I also enjoyed the ""Would you survive?"" quizzes. As suspected, I would not survive in poverty or wealth. Nope, firmly middle class, not a doubt.An interesting read for people who work with the poor or have an interest in class structure."
1,Don't bother; go volunteer at a homeless shelter instead.,There are a few scenarios that may cause you to look at things from a viewpoint different from your own. Whether this makes teachers develop more compassion towards poor students is questionable to me. Most teachers I know already have that in place.
1,John Calvin in a dress,"I confess that I read ""Nickle and Dimed,"" and ""America's Keenest City"" with skepticism. I couldn't believe that the worst of Calvinist principles were coming back. But here it is in Framework in all it's glory. Here we are, with the concept that the poor are that way because of their immorality and poor thinking skills and that the big brother of the upper middle class can get the surfs to stop their stumbling and backsliding. What about teachers who come from poverty? What about what stumbling blocks that Ms. Payne's class put in place? I was almost waiting for Ms. Payne to speak of the ""White Man's Burden"" of another century."
2,A Casual and Off-Hand Analysis,"The book strikes me as poorly researched. While Payne may have access to boatloads of data, she gives the reader very little reason to believe that she has ever discussed these topics with people living in poverty. Rather, each new idea feels as if it has been thought up off the top of the author's head. This, and the simplistic, vague language, make the book hard to follow. Each chapter seems more concerned with introducing slick, jargon-y lists than developing, proving, and defending an argument.For any educator working with many low-income students, the book's contributions are already foregone conclusions. To its credit, the book would be a helpful introduction to working with people in poverty for a reader who has never before done so. While it might serve as a starting point, it should by no means be the only or final resource for fear of developing a dangerously one-dimensional image of people in poverty."
2,Dear hipster: why read this review -- you're going to buy it anyway,"When I saw the Futureheads at Chicago's Empty Bottle in 2004, it was a revelation of jumproping vocal harmonies, savage guitar abuse and anthemic absurdity. The band's self-titled debut album was just as exciting. The Futureheads have barely stopped touring since, and it shows. All of their technical craft remains evident on News & Tributes, but there are few if any memorable moments. The songwriting just isn't there. And believe me: the band knows it. At this year's Pitchfork festival, they played perhaps three songs from N&T, choosing to lean on the older, tighter, hookier material. Want a great new rock album? Go Buy the Tokyo Police Club EP."
1,apparently overrated,"This band is too all-over-the-place with their melodies, they go off on tangents that don't make sense. They're similar to Hot Hot Heat but infinitely inferior. Don't waste your money on this, it only has about three decent tracks near the end."
2,Just wasn't for us...,"I had a Tofu cookbook that I got from Sunset years and years ago that was far superior to this book. The main issue we have is that recipes are really not something we would eat normally. Plus, there is no nutritional information for any recipe and, because of some dietary restrictions, we really needed to know fat and sodium content. I don't think this is a *bad* book - just don't think it is the right book for us!"
1,Junk,"This is a piece of junk because the instructions are wrong, and the one of the main supporting pieces was wrong, with the holes for the cam and nails and screws being on the wrong side. The nails make the wood crumble like crackers. Let the buyer beware. Useless."
2,waste of effort,It took much effort to read this book as it was clear that it was going to be just another book that described a problem but provided NO solution. I actually read the whole book trying to hang on to hope that at some point there would be practical solutions on how to stop the hurrying in our lives. WASTE OF TIME!
4,Together for the First Time,"When someone attempts to kill him Jim Chee goes to his new partner Joe Leaphorn. Three murders are similar to the attack on Chee. Tony Hillerman brings his two Navaho detectives together for the first time in an uneasy alliance, SKINWALKERS. Total opposites the two explore their heritage of witches (skinwalkers) in a fast paced police procedural sure to keep you turning the pages.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS."
4,Unusual documentary,"Assuming this is a true story, the movie is a humorous education about graffiti art that ""magically"" appears on city buildings, how it's done and the people who do it. It may prompt you to try it yourself."
2,Far from the best,"These were too small to stay in my ear while sleeping on my side without them falling out; pushing them farther in my ear was extremely uncomfortable. I see others have had similar problems, and I don't think my ear canals are unusually large. Buy a small quantity if you want to give them a shot; I prerfer Flent's soft foam earplugs by far."
4,Love these earplugs,I have been using Howard Leight Earplugs for a few years and love them. They help me with sleep. For the most part they keep most sounds out and stay in all night. I have tried every earplug on the market these are the best for me.
4,Comfortable.,"I snore and live at busy intersection, so my girlfriend and I were going through a lot of earplugs, and became somewhat of an authority on the subject. Overall they were very good with the exception of length. My girlfriend has extra small ears, so they didn't fit perfectly, but for most they should be great."
4,Better then I thought,"I bought these for my Grandsons, 8 and 5. They have a nice case and the magnacraft was so each for them to use and they loved having not to share. Great buy for the price."
4,Good Product,This item was bought as a gift. It was well put together sturdy and it was a nice idea.I would certainly recommend it for a gift. Its not a very professional item but its a good fun item for a guy who never had one before. It was well worth the price and the look on the person's face.
5,Compact binocular,"Just the way I wanted, really.Very small size, very light weight, clear lens and adjusting is easy.I just love that they have a protective bag for the binocular and a small cloth for cleaning the lens.Although I'm sure it's not a product made in 2011, a good cheap price and good quality can always make me happy.A good product, my conclusion."
5,Love it,"Love the looks of this one, haven't got to wear it yet, but it is so cute. Very vivid colors, great for summer. Can't wait to wear it."
3,make sure of the color,its says sienna but shipped me 2 tan ones... other than the wrong color on both shipments and i did tell them of the problem i love it..
4,great deal,I love this duvet. I knew ahead of time that the back side is regular cotton but that didnt dissuade me. It is very soft and plush and beautiful. For 20 dollars you cant beat it.
3,Very thin.,You do get what you pay for. This will only work for extremely large comforters; otherwise it won't fit right.
3,A different approach to an autobiography,"I was somewhat disappointed with the way the book was written. Robert Mitchum responds to interviewers questions. The book is not written by him. It is simply a dialogue between him and the interviewer. I learned about a very interesting man--a nonconformist, laid back, doesn't take himself too seriously, and seems to be a very stable person. He married his childhood sweetheart. They raised four children. He and his wife remained married until his death July 1, 1997. He was not the most refined person. He used profanity excessively. He was a kind and gentle man.This book is another one in a series of biographies I have purchased from Amazon.com. The condition was good and processing was within a reasonable amount of time."
4,I Carry A Badge,"This is a good ""old time"" (seventies) police film which needs to be put out on DVD (21st century now). It goes along with other police films such as Serpico, Super Cops, the Seven Ups, French Connection, etc. - a great look back at the world of old-style policing (Hollywood style). Give us a copy on DVD please!!"
3,recv'd damaged,"Seller good, product normally good but not this time. Received it damaged, had to repair so it could be used. Waited long time for arrival and customer needed this to get car back, otherwise I would have sent back. I suggest better packing of product inside box before shipment. Both inlet and outlet tube flattened from bouncing around inside box."
3,"Review of ""Dark Ghetto""","I had to review this book for a seminar on Race and Ethnic Relations. It was a good read, except I think the ideas were dated. I suppose scholars should read this book to gain more knowledge of the subject. But, I would use the theories to compare to the current ""dilemmas of social power"" rather than basing your current ideas upon what is represented in this book. Did that make sense? :)"
1,GET IT AWAY FROM ME!!,"Ok, first off, why are they making a cd with atrocious remakes of good songs (not counting ""The Anthem"")? It's appaling! Next, get some 40-something year old men and 50 hyper kids to sing the songs with horrid results. At this rate, just give the buyers a cd with the REAL people on them and not wannabes. No kid will want this and they don't need it either. they need the real artists with the real song and real talent. Do not buy this. Get it away from kids. GET IT AWAY FROM ME!!!!"
4,Very Beautiful for entertaining,"I agree that the stopper is a loose fit; however, it did not detract from the beauty of the decanter. I've had many compliments on how unique it is."
2,Not really worth the money,"Although it tells time well enough, and has features I want like luminous hands and date, I think this watch is overpriced and poorly designed. It has several annoying features, such as its thickness, almost 10mm. The hands are very skinny, and for some reason there is a triangle at 12 o'clock which I always mistake for the minute hand at first glance. The second hand is black which makes it hard to follow if you are timing something. I am looking for another watch, probably a Swiss Army or a Skagen, both at half the price or less."
4,Wonderfully Engaging,"Very thought-provoking, considering that it is a book for tweens. Even though I thought the beginning was a bit slow, the details were great and the struggles that the protagonist must face will pull you in. If you are looking for an escape from reality and into the surreal, this is definitely a book to pick up."
3,Don't buy,"This thing is fine, it just comes in an absurd amount of packaging. To think of all the paper they wasted sending this to me is embarrassing. Just go to target or something and buy one.P.S. by ""hinged"" lid, they mean ""we put some packing tape on the bottom and lid in the areas were hinges would be"". It lasted about 6 hours."
4,good value,"sturdy with sufficiently thick walls. good size.I purchased this as a creative solution for housing an outdoor plant that needed to be brought into an unheated all season room.It does the trick and the herbs are doing very well. next spring, will repurpose this-perhaps even for the intended use."
5,Trying to teach my grandchild about wooden shoes!,Great story as well! We have watched it over and over and over!!! So glad some of the good oldies are now being made available in the newer format.
4,hans,good version of film.I also bought a version with Basil Rathbone but haven't watched it yet.Excellent acting by obscure actors
2,Delany branches into fantasy.,This three volume set comprises an attempt by Delany to broaden his fan base. Exploring the realm of fantasy fiction with his own combination of psyodelica storytelling.
5,Rock your whirled!,"Glass Backwards is an eye opener, expect the unexpected when you read this little tome that exposes the ugly truth under the surface.. reality is alot closer to what this book portrays than most would like to admit..definitely reccommend it especially for people who may wonder why they made the choice to sell out along the way."
4,Excellent map of a very small area,"This is quite a good map, and as someone who's lived in Boston for nearly three years, I find myself glad to have it more than I'd care to admit. However, purchasers should note that there are significant portions of metro Boston that are not covered by this map, (Cambridge, Allston, Brighton, Brookline, East Boston, for starters) and that to have a guide to most of the city you will need more maps or a larger one.This is a great map of Downtown, though, and provides plenty of detail for those walking the Freedom Trail, trying to find anything in the Copley maze of hotels, etc."
5,Perfect,Good quality. I didn't have any buttons pop off as the other review mentioned. The color is absolutely perfect too. My husband wore this for a formal event and it was absolutely perfect.
4,It's going to be great for what I need it for.,"This shirt came to me quickly and in good quality. The pictures do not do the color justice, it actually looks a lot better in person. The sleeves are a little too short to fold over for the convertable cuffs, but the buttons are a light enough color that if you put the cufflink through the holes with them straight it looks fine. All of the stitching seems great and the buttons are holding strong. I have already worn it a few times with no problems. The only reason that this is a 4 instead of a 5 is that it is a little too loose of a fit and the sleeves are a little too short to fold; however, it still looks and feels great if you are wearing it under a suit jacket or a vest."
5,Wonderful for Prayer,"I KEEP BUYING THIS BOOK AND GIVING IT AWAY. IT IS THE BEST REWRITE OF THE PSALMS THAT I'VE COME ACROSS. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A ""PRAYER"" BOOK, THIS IS IT."
1,"This is New Age, Not Judeo Christian","If you're looking for Judeo Christian prayer, just read the psalms from the Bible. This is a new age rewrite of the psalms."
3,its full lead crystal,I love the glasses...but i am concerned abt them being full lead crystal glasses. I understand its harmful to be exposed ot lead.....i don;t see anyone mentioned anything abt it..any thoughts??
4,Better than buying either on their own,"I bought Shrek the 3rd with Shrek the Halls because I knew there was a sub par shrek movie I had seen and my son loves Shrek 1 and 2. He is just under 2 years old and he will watch either movie straight through no problems. Thankfully he also enjoyed Shrek 3 which I find rather tedious. Shrek the Halls is a breath of fresh air, and rates up there with Shrek 1.Pity it is a made for Christmas TV episode rather than a movie...because it is a great view, just not worth the standard DVD price tag given the length.I recommend this package, my son loves both movies, but we typically watch Shrek the halls and Shrek 1/2, we only watch Shrek 3 once a month tops because it just isn't as good."
1,Died After 2 Years,"At first I loved this TV. The sound was not the best, but the picture was fantastic for the two years I had it. Four days ago, the picture started losing some of its crispness, then yesterday it died right in the middle of watching a movie. Apparently, then main board is fried. I have since heard that this is a common complaint once the TV passes its first year. Out of the box, this TV is great and people will write glowing reviews after owing it a few days. Read the reviews that talk about having owned this TV beyond the first year. I wouldn't recommend wasting your money on this one."
1,Worst television I've ever owned,"I bought this television at Best Buy exactly 6 weeks ago and today, exactly 6 weeks to the day, it completely stopped working. I paid $1800. for it and Best Buy will not accept an exchange or return, no matter what. The home theater manager told me that they do not relax their return policies no matter what. He also told me that there is a power supply problem with these televisions, so beware when buying one, that it may not last very long due to this issue. Make sure to buy it somewhere else, and to get a warranty on it because apparently they are made not to last."
4,Nice stylish boot,"These boots are very cute and super trendy. They run true to size - I wear an 8 and these fit in size 8, unlike most Steve Madden shoes which seem to run big. The bone color is absolutely stunning! It's so unique. I would definately recommend these."
5,Good seller,in the beginning i didn't believe what i found then i realize better to hurry. Good lens for affordable price and fast shipping. Good seller highly recommended. thanks
1,Lemon,"After trying and trying and getting only lousy images, I sent this lens to Canon for a service. I was told ""an adjustment of the circuit board was incorrect causing the focus to operate incorrectly""I received my lens back and, $290 later, got the same poor images: not sharp, almost hazy.I sent it back again and it was returned with the following comment: “lens assembly line did not operate correctly causing the focus to operate improperly”.Either it wasn’t fixed the first time or the product is flawed by multiple recurrent structural problems.Canon would not replace the lens.Would not buy again and extremely disappointed with Canon customer service."
2,"A bulky, detachable snapshooter lens with an ""L"" on the side","This lens is considerably less sharp and less contrasty than my other zoom lenses (16-35mm mkii and 70-200mm mkii). At the 105mm end of the range it is as if you have a bit of vaseline on the front of the lens. Some reviewers have excused this because the lens is a wide ratio zoom. I don't buy that because a 28-300L that I have borrowed is way sharper than this lens and over a much wider zoom ratio.I wouldn't recommend this lens unless you are getting it as part of a kit, where it adds only $700 or so to the overall price. That way when you are disappointed you have a chance to unload it on craigslist for approximately what you have paid."
4,Almost perfect,"After 3 years of using a Tamron 28-75mm, I finally bought the 24-105L for its wider range and build / image quality.Every good thing that's been said about this lens is true, so I won't bother repeating it. I'd like to rate this lens 4.5 stars, but that is obviously not a choice. The zoom ring is a little stiff - being able to adjust would be nice. And I find myself missing the larger aperture of the Tamron.Other pros compared to Tamron 24-75:The difference in FOV between 24mm and 28mm is actually pretty noticeable, to my surprise.Build quality, even the hood. The hood for the Tamron is stiff and takes some force to attach / detach. The Canon hood goes on effortlessly, and the interior is lined with a black velvety material.Cons:There seems to be a fair amount of distortion at 24mm.Price, of course.Would I buy it knowing what I did? I guess so. I'm still not sure if I made the right choice in not picking up the 24-70mm instead. But IS is very nice to have."
2,Ok but not great...,It is good to increase the screen real estate but any dialog boxes that appear in the center of the screen normally are split across both screens. This is annoying for log in or error boxes required with some software applications.Does not work well when you go to standby on a laptop and try to power up and use both screens.Set up was pretty easy
1,It's only a single,"I was very disappointed to find this was a single, with 3 tracks, and not a full album."
2,Get the Book - Skip the Tour,"This book is written in a concise and easy to read format. As a chicago suburb native, I enjoyed reading tales about places and areas that I am familiar with and have been to. AS FOR THE TOUR, I was completely disappointed. Imagine sitting on a bus for four hours listening to the ""micro-machine guy"" rattle through places where people have seen ghosts. Very little story telling actually took place on the tour. Basically, we'd drive past a store stuck between a subway and dunkin donuts and he'd say, ""so and so died here...now it's haunted,"" and that would be it. He even had to nerve to tell us that his last bus driver quit because he saw a ghost, and that was the end of that story. Instead of hearing stories about China Town we stopped at a chinese grocery store and he tried to get us to buy knock-off Guchi bags. Anyways, get the book if you are local to Chicago, forget the tour."
4,"Confusing, yet well written.","Have you ever wondered what it would be like to have acomplete stranger live in your house? A stranger that doesn't even talk? This farmer hits a stranger on the side of the road and decides to take him in until he gets better. This book is somewhat confusing, yet very well written. The illstrations are very well done. I give this book a 4 out of 5 stars."
1,Nothing to write home about,"Without rough use, the rubber has already started separating from the wooden paddle in a couple of weeks."
5,GREAT ALBUM,SCHILLER I THINK THESE IS ONE OF THEIR BEST ALBUM THEY ARE GERMAN AND I LOVE THE ELECTRONIC MUSIC I WOULD DEFENETILY RECOMEND THE ALBUM TO ONYONE TRY IT U MAY LIKE IT IF NOT YOU WILL LOVE IT
5,Totally captivating,I was enamored with this book as a child and now I am getting a copy for my soon to be born nephew. It's the most memorable book I had as a child. The illustrations transport the viewer into another world of possibilities with all their detail. It was fun to spend hours looking into the details of the illustrations for more and more creatures and things. It's also a sweet story with a lesson geared toward simplicity and modesty in our desires.
4,slow train,One of Kim's better accoustic recordings. Love the guitar & harmonica mix. The vocals seem to fit right in not being to loud or soft
3,Instant VB Animation,"It is a good book and probably the only book to start learning animation in VB. Another book ""Animation Magic with Visual Basic 5"" is not for beginners at all."
3,Son liked it,I got this for my son as he requested it. He liked it a lot though I'm not sure that he's watched it much.
4,Magic Johnson Documentary,I have watched many 30 for 30 docs. This one certainly tells the story of Magic and the discovery of his HIV status. He seems like a really nice person and I understand him wanting to tell his own story - but i think the documentary would have been a little better if he had not personally narrated it.
1,Won't Get Fooled Again,"I'm very disappointed with this album. I should have known it was too good to be true. The songs may be by the original artists, but 22 of the 30 songs are NEW RECORDINGS. They don't sound quite the same as the originals."
3,Jinx Ship,"Jinx Ship is not my favorite Howard Pease book. I recently bought a copy because it was the only one that I could find by the author at that time. (They are no longer available in librarys.) However, I read, and re-read all of Pease's books through Jr. High School and High School and good and medium, they were an important influence on my life. Even though it was not possible to find employment on a ship, I was the first woman diesel mechanic employed by a well-known marine diesel repair station here in Seattle. I learned integrity, courage and a love of reading and learning from Tod Moran and Captain Jarvis. If you leave your Howard Pease books laying around, your daughters and grand daughters may read them also!"
3,THISTLE ROCKS !!!!!!!,"THIS WAS AN OBSESSION OF MINE AS A CHILD . I RENTED IT ONCE AND FORCED MY DAD TO BUY IT FROM THE VIDEO STORE . I THINK THAT ( BECAUSE I FIRST SAW IT AT A YOUNG AGE) IT WAS THE FIRST MOVIE I HAD SEEN THAT SHOWED PEOPLE COULD CHANGE . I HAVE TO SAY I HAVEN'T REALLY READ THE BOOK , BUT I COULD NEVER FIND IT . IT'S BEEN AWHILE SINCE I'VE SEEN MY BELOVED MOVIE THAT INSPIRED A LOT OF PRETEND GAMES. ANYWAY I'M GLAD TO BE THE FIRST TO REVIEW THE ELM- CHANTED FOREST . END"
5,Loved George and Gracie -- Absolutely Love This Book,"Love George Burns and Gracie Allen and watch their re-runs late at night on Antenna TV.While I have not yet finished the book, it it clearly a tribute to them both and to George's devotion to his very talented and loving wife. I am thoroughly enjoying every word of it."
3,The Fence,"If you are a fan of Billy Wirth, as I am, you will like the film.This movie has a fair script,good cast and stars Billy.I bought the movie to add to my collection.Would recommend adding it to yours.Enjoy!!!! ..."
4,moments of dark music and poetry,"Followers of Joy Division, early Cure, Echo and the Bunnymen and other darker bands with existencialists lyrics: this is the CD that you are looking for. Crispy Ambulance is a fabulous four-pieces band and they created an explosive combination of harsh vocals, atmospheric guitars plus an incredible solid bass-drums performance. This CD contains studio demos, radio sessions, live tracks and a magnificent artwork. A must!!"
3,Ten year old machine,"I have had my 132Q for about ten years I guess, and it worked fairly well for a while, I was a teen when I got it and only did lightweight sewing, but as it gets older, even with regular maintenance it does a poorer and poorer job keeping up. Oh the headaches this thing has caused! The bobbin does crazy things and spits out thread and bunches thread under the fabric, tangles up and freezes the machine, I know this is a common problem with this model, and can sometimes be helped with a metal bobbin, threading your machine correctly and replacing your needles every so often even if they look fine. Also oiling your machine can help. Hope you enjoy your 132Q and it can make an okay learning machine, but if you are a frequent stitcher or crafter OR know very little about bobbins and tension, this machine might not be for you."
4,Learned some new things.,Good read and study. I liked the book and is a very good beginning book. I hope to build off this learning to more in depth study.
5,Great Explanation of the Truine God,"I understood the doctrine of the Trinity before this book but after reading it, it became a lot more clear. This is an excellent read for someone that wants to dive in deeper with Christian thought. Well done James!"
5,indispensable gem,"Professor Whitebread came to our law school during first year to promote (and give away) this book during a lunch. The advice in it is right on, and I would suggest reviewing it before taking finals in every semester of law school. It is very short, so you probably need an additional book for first year guidance as to outlining, etc., but this book is excellent on taking exams. Also, if you just do all the things that he assumes you have done during the semester, this book might be the only one you need. A great piece of work from an energetic, intelligent man."
4,these guys rock,"An amazing album, it's wonderful to hear some very talented jazz musicians riffing off of pop music like ""Teen Spirit"" with so much creativity. The traditional numbers like ""Stella by Starlight"" will always be enjoyable, but to stay alive jazz needs to keep moving forward as well as looking back. Highly recommended!"
2,Worst Tamilee Yet,"I used to swear by her videos, but this is the worst I've see. The exercises aren't bad, but repeats the warm-up in each section which is a complete waist of time, the camera production is poor, she actually seems distracted and has a cocky little attitude which is so different from her earlier workout videos. She doesn't encourage you to workout with her, and only the first ""set"" exercises are really challenging."
4,Try it...you won't be disappointed!,"Tamilee Webb's excercise programs are extremely practical for women who blame not working out, on the lack of time. Her sections are short and intense and you truly feel the work out paying off, as you do it. It burns!"
3,"simple, concise directions, quick results","let me tell you...I picked this up used for 99 cents and it truly got me the results I wanted. I'm a volleyball player, and after doing this tape for 3 months+ every day for 15 min. I felt I was able to do everything in life better!even play my guitar harder. Sure, it's so 80's, but this isn't a fashion tape. Eat right, use this tape correctly, be motivated, and get the results you want. Demand more of yourselves."
5,A VERY GOOD TRANSFER.,"This is one of my personel favorites, primarily because it made me afraid to sleep at night. It is a really good DVD to Blue-ray transfer, I wish they could have added a few more extras for the Blue-ray version, but this is still a good transfer to this date. Seriously, can you amagine if that Nathan Grantham Zombie guy was in your room while you were sleeping, ""chills""."
4,Captures the campy feel of horror comic books.,"If you loved the old horror comic books you read when you were a kid, you will love this movie. As for the reviewer who finds this film so foolish, I would just respectfully say that this film was intended for entertainment. It's not supposed to be masterpiece theater."
5,One of the Best Horror collections around.,"Based on short stories written by Stephen King, George A. Romero (Dir. Night Of The Living Dead) has made a top-notch horror flick. This movie will make you laugh as well as make you cringe. King also has a role as a backwoods hillbilly farmer. If you are a horror buff this is a must see classic."
3,very creepy,A nice collection of short stories done by Stephen King. Although some people may find some of the stories strange. Because it's not the usual ghosts in haunted houses END
1,Not so creepy,"An episode movie that starts out with a boy not being allowed to read a DC horror comic. Once that presentation is over the viewer gets to see a couple of the comics in reality. Some of them are actually quite good and some I just didn't care about. The first one was a pretty creepy ghost story called ""Fathers Day"" which was less then good(Ed Harris had a role in it). The second was more of a funny screwball piece about a farmer that finds a meteorite and if I'm not mistaken the farmer is played by Stephen King. After that we get to see Leslie Nielsen and Ted Danson and a couple of more actors playing around in something that is less then good."
1,Garbage.,"The old EC Comics were filled with gruesome tales, it is true, but they usually contained at least the kernel of a brilliant ida and were pulled off with excellent writing, artwork, and dialogue. What we have with Creepshow The Movie is absolutely the lamest, juvenile, and superficial adaptation of that genuine artistry into an atrocity of a film. It's as though Romeo and King think that by employing simple gimmicky devices they can get away with absolutely horrid acting and utterly debauched violence. It's a sad, depressing film that defames the excellent work of the original EC artists. Nothing more to say."
4,Fair enough.,"What is there to say? Creepshow is classic old-school horror in short-stories.Stephen King is cool as farmer (""Ow that kind of luck spells B-A-D!"")."
5,Entertaining,"Fun to watch late at night, or early in the morning just as long as it is dark outside. Makes it more creepy!"
5,Awesome lamp,"My mom sufferes from allergies and she snores. My stepdad says since she's had the lamp by her bedside she is sleeping better, and the allergies are not as bad. Delivery was right on schedule as promised."
4,Good BUT...,"If your kids love Sonic like mine, you can't go wrong with a Sonic video. However, out of the four stories on this video, only one of them has a christmas theme."
2,A disappointing DVD,"The ""Sonic Christmas Blast"" DVD consists of the Sonic Christmas Blast special (about 22 minutes long) and 3 Sonic Underground episodes. The Christmas episode itself seems like only a child would enjoy it (and probably a young adult that saw the special when it originally aired in the late 90's). The animation and plot is laughably simple and ridiculous.As for the 3 Sonic Underground episodes, they're terrible. Children might be confused by the sudden change of characters and plot when the Christmas special ends and the Underground episodes begin. Underground is a completely different series in which Sonic has a brother and sister and is on a quest to find their mother. The animation consists of moddy dark colors, the plot itself is a little dark (very much so for a children's cartoon) and in each episode Sonic and his siblings sing a terrible song that makes Barney seem like Pavarotti.If you're buying for kids, it may be a decent DVD. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother."
3,DAZED by the HEAT,"This volume of Midnight Panther is basically an excuse for tiny schoolgirl uniforms. And what the heck is wrong with THAT?This time out, the Panthers are involved in a strange storyline involving this bizarre dream demon causing all sorts of sexy mayhem on a college campus. If you don't think this is going to end in anything other than a catfight, you aren't familiar with Midnight Panther!The most compelling thing about the Panther series is the way it exudes such quiet sensuality. Unlike the straight-forward nudie pin-ups of Satoshi Urushihara, You Asagiri's art conveys a subtle sexiness that hits you between the eyes as opposed to between the...well, you know where I'm going.Once again, You Asagiri's artwork is the real star, and you'll find yourself flipping through the pages to admire the art again and again."
1,Skewed.,"This book is very skewed to the right. Superficial and disappointing, frankly. Had to read it for a class. It spent a dozen or so pages lamenting the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal and had nothing but praise for Reagan and Bush."
5,A Gem of a Documentary,"Even though I am a lifelong Detroit Tigers fan, I learned so much about this quiet man as he excelled as a baseball player. How he dealt with the Antisemitism is a lesson in courage."
3,A decent enough read,"This is a good read for grown-ups in setting boundaries with their parents. Also pretty easy to get through. However, my caution here is that it is written in the US, it's a very monocultural book, and therefore might not be for cultures where parents and grown up children are close and spend lots of time together. There are many psychologists and non-professionals alike in the US who would see this as codependence or dysfunction of some sort. Or whatever.Hope someone can write a book soon about having a close relationship with your parents while having breathing space and room to be an adult in your own right, in cultures where it's perfectly acceptable to still be living with your parents at 30 or 40. And in cultures where grandparents and elders are very important.I guess it's time for someone from one of those cultures to write a book on that topic! Will someone please step up to the plate?"
2,Expect breakage,"If you're purchashing this expecting to get 200 discs, you will likely be disappointed. I bought them expecting to have about 10 discs or so broken because the price was so cheap. I was right, but there were 20 others that only clicked closed on the bottom half. I bought them to make Christmas CDs for friends, co-workers, people at church, etc. It was still a good price for how many discs I got, but it's hard to recommend a product in which 15 percent of the discs were essentially unusable. It's still a great bargain, but don't be surprised to see a lot of broken, cracked or chipped discs."
2,Below Average,"Better than paper sleeves in only one way, puncture resistant. Bought 200 of these at just under $30, that works out to 15-cents apiece. Bought similar, not the same, cheapies from other vendors in packs of 100 at 20-cents apiece and the 20-cent items are far more reliable. These 15-cent items are constructed of such thin (too flexible) plastic that the case will pop open unintentionally with the slightest force. I recommend the 2-cent paper sleeves or the 20-cent heavier gauge plastic case."
3,Poor Packaging = broken cases,"If you order from this vendor, and have the order fulfilled by Amazon, anticipate having broken cases. Of the 200 cases I ordered 13 were broken. I emailed the vendor regarding the issue, and they basically said they weren't responsible because Amazon fulfilled the order. Either order from this vendor knowing that you will not receive 200 useable cases, or consider purchasing elsewhere."
5,Great Product Fast shipping,I ordered three cases of these and out of 600 cd cases none of them were damaged. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a great deal. these case were constructed better than some of the ones that we paid almostdouble for.
4,freddie hubbard live at the village vanguard,"-there are two vendors of the same video (live at the village vanguard)-sound quality is mediocre on both (same recording)-video quality average for this type of recording-too much max gordon, etc-personel: cedar walton (p), ron carter (b), lenny white (d) and freddie hubbard (t)-freddie was the greatest trumpeter of all times? he plays harder and longer than any other trumpeter i have seen. he is technically awesome and also has too many ideas to get them all in like trane.-Fantasy in D comes the closest to revealing freddie's artistrywould buy again as i'm a freddie fanatic!"
3,Love it! or Hate it! you be the judge.,"With no big star names on the box, I went into this movie with no expectations. I was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed this film - don't get me wrong - production values are low, but this is no better or worse than the latest Steven Seagal movies - and they have huge sums of money. This is one of those movies that you'll either LOVE IT! or HATE IT!You be the judge."
5,i like the design of your pacifiers,Chomp Baby Pacifierand i would like to buy another designsthank you
1,tried to break in,Walking around on to 12 hr shifts and the top of the boot kept rubbing near the zippers latch. It's a shame I used the Under Armor boots (new on the market) and they were great right from the start.
2,Disappointed,"This is an incomplete review of The Bones Of Time and perhaps unjust for that very reason. I have read through a fourth of this novel but I am giving up on it. I guess I was expecting something too much on the same level of Wm Gibson, whom I enjoy. But after reading 100+ pages and nothing substantial happening plot-wise, I've become disappointed. Contrary to some of the other reviews here, I feel the characters are flat, with the exception of the young princess. While Gibson is able to weave three separate plots and bring them together at the end of his novel, I was expecting something similar here. I am considering donating my copy of The Bones Of Time to the library. Perhaps someone else will enjoy it better than I. Thank you."
5,A clever story of magic and romance evolves with a strong lesson in self-confidence,Dennis Haseley's The Invisible Moose receives Steven Kellogg's warm illustrations as it provides a picturebook romance for the very young. What chance does a shy boy-moose have to win the love of the most beautiful girl-moose in Canada? He's content to love from afar - until the terrible Steel McSteal captures his love: it's time to stop being shy! A clever story of magic and romance evolves with a strong lesson in self-confidence.
2,"Not so great, much better for the price.","The two stars are for the printer. It works very good and makes decent photos. However, the camera itself is terrible. It has such a slow lens speed that when you take a picture it is usually blurry 90% of the time no matter what setting you are on. It is big, bulky, and so much better out there. Go for the Lumix in my view."
1,Not what I expected,"This video was not what I expected. I was expecting Brendan to give at least a basic explanation of his training as well as tips on training and technique. What I got was video of Brendan swimming with some other guy narrating. The narration was a vague explanation of what makes Brendan Henson a good breaststroke swimmer. I honestly feel I could have just watched Youtube videos of Brendan swimming and got just as much out of it.If you are a Brendan Hansen fan and just want to see him swim and talk in a few small interviews (they give no insight into how to become a better breaststroke swimmer), then buy this video."
3,"Not brilliant, but not bad.","I did not like ""Interference"" and I did not think it was brilliant. Everybody praises Lawrence Miles for being a ground breaking and innovative writer. For someone who is so innovative, he spends a lot of time mucking about in the past. And to the man who makes a past time of slagging off his fellow Doctor Who writers, he got his just desserts with this books and must face the facts that he is not and never will be as brilliant as either Robert Holmes or Douglas Adams!!Almost everything is set right in this book. I thought the writers found a great way of tying up all the loose ends rather nicely in this book while causing a few more problems. Although I am very fond of Gallifrey and I happen to be a fan of most of the stories set on the Doctor's home planet, I'm not bothered by it's destruction."
5,Marie is set to rock the world!,"This awesome little dynamo of Aussie talent has surpassed herself yet again with this superb release. Just when I thought I could not be surprised with the strength of her talent, I was bowled over with this CD. Her versatility in all her CD's is, in my opinion, incredible and this CD is one impressive dance release."
4,Nice Mirror,"Mirror works great, but mounting bar doesn't come with screws or have enough of an ""angle"" to it. I had to move it farther down the wall than I wanted to get the angle I needed. All in all, a great mirror."
5,No more scraped garage wall,"This mirrow is just perfect for my needs. My garage is very narrow, and we have scraped the wall several times pulling in. The mirrow is the perfect size and shows us excatly how close we are to the wall"
3,Just okay,"Mirror arrived scratched up, not majorly, but I was using it indoors as part of a wall hanging and it is not as nice-looking as I'd hoped."
2,A little to basic,"Although I am stating that this book is a little to basic, maybe what I was looking for was just more then this book was intended to deliver. I was looking for a book to help calculate how many zones were needed, what type of sprinkler heads, etc. This book had great photographs and basic knowledge. If you are ready to design and install your own system you might want a more detailed book."
2,"If you prefer good recording sound, don't buy it!","These are Karajan's 1945-1955 recordings. There is no noise but the sound quality is very bad. When I started to listen to these CDs, I suspected that my CD player was malfunctioning. If you prefer good sound quality, then get other Karajan's recordings."
3,WellPatch Migraine Cooling Pads - OK,"I suffer from migraines and figured I would try something different. So I bought theses and tried them out. At first it seemed like a good idea since I usually use a cooling gel mask to help sooth the pain and this seemed the cooling would last longer and not sweat like the mask did. It's a bit to big for my forhead and I lay with my face down on the right so it felt a bit weird laying on half of it. Being scared the gel would squeeze out, but it didn't. It seemed to keep cool, but since I used the blanket to block out any light to make the migraine worse, it had a werid annoying smell from it. So we all know migraines, light-smell-noises can trigger it to be worse. So after awhile I couldn't take it anymore. So I had to take it off. It does say you can put it in the frige to make it cooler than normally would just in a cabinet. It also say's you can cut it, but yet again that was something I didn't try."
2,Intriguing . . . but annoying!,"What could be fascinating swiftly turns to frustration.I honor Shamanism, have learned much from its rich, insightful journeys, and want to learn more. However . . .Ingerman comes across as yet another New-Ager who's just learned something--then, immediately, presumes she's ready to teach it.She's unable (unwilling?) to understand that some Shamanic journeys are not literal but obviously symbolic--as in ""Going to the Land of the Dead,"" on page 113.As a self-appointed gatekeeper, she never questions that her personal journeys might illumine only her own life, but no one else's.This book is a stepping stone, if not a stumbling block, to better, more useful ones."
4,Whoa there horsie,"Some critical reviews on that first page there about the author not teaching soul retrieval and being self important. To teach shamanic soul retrieval in a book would be highly irresponsible. Also if you keep in mind that this is the FIRST book on soul retrieval and that in many ways she was the first person to teach people how to do this in the US, who was she going to reference besides her self? Also the whole thing has evolved since then as well.This is a nice intro to soul retrieval, its not too complex, and the case studies are meant to give people a good idea of what it is, it is not a how to book. If your advanced in shamanism, this is not likely to teach you new things but might give you some insights. If you find anyone who will teach you shamanic journeying/soul retrieval in a book run the other way. The audiotape is also very nice, and the way she presents the material in the tape is very easy to understand. This is not a Carlos Castaneda type book."
5,Sandra Ingerman is a true healer,This is the most beautiful and beneficial work I have ever come across in my 35 years as a Massage Therapist.
1,Soul Retrieval,Half of the book contains all the necessary info. The rest of the material is just redundant. I won't recommend it to my friends. Thank you.
3,Portfolio Keeping.,"Used for class, what else is needed to know about it. Item as described! ! ! ! ! ! !"
1,Oops - wrong disc.,"I had to give this product the lowest rating because the disc within the packaging for ""Egypt Eternal - The Quest for Lost Tombs"" was in fact the disc for another National Geographic DVD, ""Egypt: Quest for Eternity."" I had also ordered and received ""Egypt: Quest for Eternity"" at the same time and ended up with two identical discs. I hope National Geographic discovers and corrects the error."
2,Standard Selections for Classical Greek,"This book has 277 pages. The first part of the book(more than 80 pages) consists of selections from the Old and New Testaments, and Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha. The next parts are the selections from Philo, Jesephus, Early Christian Literature, Greek papyri and inscriptions, and the Pagan Hellenistic Greek. The Greek words are indexed on page 211 through the end. A short introduction in English was presented to every theme or to every author of the Greek text.The book was published more than half century ago (in 1947). Printed in old typography on the old paper. Letters are small, but legible. Recommendable for those who would like to read original Greek text(especially in Koine Greek)."
1,Awful!,"Sometimes a score can be taken from its movie and enjoyed on its own, e.g. The Patriot, Gettysburg, or Glory. Such is not the case here. Certainly, the music in the Four Feathers fit with the episodes in the movie, but it is awful when removed from its visual context. Much of the music is whining Middle Eastern chant and the rest is boring, unmoving piano music. It just doesn't work by itself. Pass on this one (even if you liked the movie)."
3,Suisal Back starap,"Initially it was quite effective and very stimulating. Unfortunately it immediately stretched to 48"" long and narrowed to about 2+"".It it is now very much like a piece of rope when moistened and is now only moderately effective as it covers far less back area.Had it been somewhat wider initially and even shorter, I believe it would be more serviceable long term. The manufacturer showed have allowed for the known stretching characteristics of sisal and compensated with more material.It appears to be remaining intact after five uses but I would not recommend it unless the buyer is acceptable to this transformation."
2,Used product - beware!,I was so incredibly dissapointed. Amazon sold me the pasta maker as new and when I opened up the package to give to my husband for his birthday I found that it had been used. THe machine had oil all over it and the cardboard box had absorbed the oil stains. There was also flour at the bottom of the box.The pasta maker is also much smaller than what is depicted as well even though it is one of the highest priced and rated machines. Read the detailed dimensions.Recommendation: Purchase products like these in person - spend the extra $200-$300 dollars and buy industial.Sorely disspointed in Amazon!
1,poor design,"The key part of it is made of Aluminum! not steel! that's why mine failed in 4 weeks. ""Made of Italy"", so what, pooooor product. I am trying to solve this problem in US, not easy, seems no agent from this company.I should have bought one made in China, much cheaper. maybe better."
5,Best Pasta Maker I've Ever Owned,"This is the best pasta maker I've ever owned. I owned the same model for 13 years before the gears started giving up the ghost and I decided it was time to replace it. I make pasta at least two times a month and I never had any issues with the previous version I owned. This new one seems to be of the same construction as my old one, I've used it about ten times with no issues. Smooth gear action, and good variability in dough thickness you can produce. I've used this machine to make linguine, lasagna noodles and the dough for ravioli."
1,Poor design/execution,"Side plate with thickness adjustment popped on the 3rd or 4th batch. Hubby reseated the single tiny sheet metal screw and all seemed well,,, until part-way into the next batch. Hubby reseated the screw to no avail, he tried installing another, larger one - no go. Luckily, he was able to save the batch with a small c-clamp.More, and beefier screws in the side plates would make this a perfect machine. Disappointing,,, and this is supposed to be the most highly rated manual pasta machines."
4,Sent as a gift,"We sent this to our son for Christmas and he loved it. He is an architect turned chef, so it must function well and make great tasting pasta!"
5,Built to last,"I have had my Atlas machine for about 30 years. It is a good straight-forward unit that will outlast you if you don't immerse it. The trick is learning to get your dough right; too moist & it will stick, too dry and it will crack. Use a pastry brush and flour to work any too moist bits off the rollers and frame and you'll be fine.I have several of the cutter attachments and the ravioli attachment. The ravioli attachment takes some getting used to, don't overload the hopper. I would highly recommend the basic Atlas and cutters but for ravioli you might be happier with one of the ""ice-cube tray"" type forms that are offered amongst the ""customers who bought this also bought these"" suggestions at the bottom of the Amazon page."
2,"Great idea, but...","I've had this pasta machine for a while now. I have made my own pasta for years - by hand - and, as arthritis began to complicate this, someone suggested a pasta machine. I was so glad not to have to do all the rolling and cutting with my bad hand, I put up with it, but I'm finally fed up.This machine is not built well. The handle used for the various rolling and cutting functions does not lock into place. It continually moves out of position or falls out altogether.The clamp mechanism for securing the machine to a counter is far, far too large a mouth to clamp to any of my counters or kitchen island, even at maximum closure, so the machine, heavy though it is, wobbles around and moves out of position, so I have to use one hand to try to hold it, feed the dough in and keep moving it back into place.When it cuts, it does an ok job, but, after today, my hand is so sore from fighting with this darn thing, I'm chucking it and looking for something else."
2,Good but...,"a bit difficult to use. The first one I ordered was broken, the second one is in good shape, but it's not as easy to use as I expected. I'll practice more this summer, but right now it gets so messy that I can't use it every time I want for lack of time to clean up!"
5,Can't make pasta without it!,I love to hand knead dough but for pasta this is my personal helper. It's really not that expensive and if you like A grade pasta then this is an absolute necessity.
1,Avoid if at all possible,"This book is a nightmare. There is nothing fundamental about the statistics within this book. The author provides very few examples of how to work through a problem. Frequently, the author is condescending, and he has a lot of irrelevant information. Several statistics professors at my university have looked at this book when I have gone to them for help, and they are amazed at how poorly the book is written. The questions at the end of each chapter require knowledge that the author has not begun to explain, so students have zero concept of how to solve a problem. Teachers who use this book should be ashamed! Also, many of the website links do not work, so the necessary resources are not available! This book is too expensive to be this poorly put together!"
2,Weak Rapping Good Beats,"Most of the album is subpar, but Edie Brikell with Slug is one of my top ten desert songs.Buy this song!!!"
1,Awful truly awful,"This has to be one of the most annoying and terrible DVD's I have watched in a long time. The narration is absolutely cringeworthy, boring and to be honest if this was the only thing I saw about Hawaii I might not even bother going.Some of the camera work is not too bad but the music, dear god the music. Who chose this drivel. This inane, probably royalty free dross that fills in every single minute of this dreadful DVD.There is clearly a whole in the market for some good tourist videos about Hawaii, but I have yet to find it and this certainly isn't it. It's going straight in the bin."
2,review,After just returing from hawaii....I found this dvd not good ///reshowned several items over and again///was done by some one who really should find other work than try to make a dvd...its worth approx $2.00 to me ..any one want to buy it..........
3,The Game Isn't Deadly?!,"I'm a little confused by what I thought I saw in the trailer vs the movie...In the trailer it makes you think that the game they play is actually dangerous - but in the movie it's really just rival gangs and a very long sequence of ""ROCKY"" training.It's shot well. Other than that - I watched waiting for the game to get deadly..."
4,Hair product that works,TIGI has recently changed the look of their product line and have renamed some of their products. It has been difficult to find Catwalk Work It in the original formula / design. I've tried the newer product and keep returning to this one but getting harder and harder to find - please keep stocking this.
5,Been moisturizer i've used yet.,Gotta join the majority on this one. I really like the moisturizer. Been using this for about a week and my face is dramatically less oily looking at the end of the day. Wish it was sold in stores though.
2,Disappointed,"I applied the Bjore as directed on the package, and used it for about a week. I noticed that the ""shine control"" only seemed to last about 10 minutes, and left my skin feeling dry and cracked. The other problem I encountered is that it caused me to break out with acne everywhere I applied it."
4,A promising debut!,"This is the debut album from Modesto, California's Transport. This album shows quite a bit of promise, as well as containing some very hyphy tunes. I especially enoyed the variety of influences on tracks such as ""Schwinn."" Transport also has a follow up ep titled ""Sudden Oak Death"" which contains some of their best work yet. This is an above-average effort from a band who is showing the hyphe."
2,"WAIT! This is NOT a ""How-to"" video! It's good but understa","I learned the hard way that this is NOT a ""how to do a handstand"" instructional video. I purchased it to help my ten year old daughter to learn safely how to 'do' handstands.This is a short, 22 minute video that shows fine tuning points and techniques of the handstand position suited for athletes who already know how but want to improve technique. This instruction is done very well and in a lively fashion.It doesn't instruct how to get up into a handstand position or how to work up to it. Or balance. Or safe exit techniques. Or hand walking or anything else."
4,"An excellent summary of the breed, characteristics, and care","A very readable, down to earth guide to the breed. The author describes the 'Westie's' characteristics, while giving some insight into the background of the breed and the reasons for those traits. It covers the breed standards (however somewhat generally), and deals with the practicalities of bringing home a brand new ""Westie"" puppy for the first time. Well written, by an author who obviously loves the breed, and conveys part of that love to the reader. I had trouble putting it down."
2,"pretty pictures, some good points but not very well written","The book was a very basic, somewhat helpful book on the breed. It had some beautiful pictures of Westies. It was certainly pleasant reading but not very detailed."
3,Like a good conversation....,"This work was like a good conversation. A bit pithy and cliched at times, it raises many important issues within the black American diaspora yet does not present any specific solutions. The reader definitely gains the sense that he or she is actually engaged in conversation with Dr. West and the other individual; however, just when the reader is about to put his two cents in, the chapter ends. The conversations with Pat Williams was the most enlightening. I guess, one could perceive the levity of the this work as optimism, a quality that earns the four stars. Definitely, a nightstand piece that preps you for a solution-oriented mind."
1,gooses review,Reading this book is like reading a dictionary. It should read more like an encyclopedia. That would make it more interesting. This book is basically one definition after the next. Ive had books that give you a word and then tell you why its important and how to identify it those are much better. When you open the book up and look through it it appears similar to an eeencyclopedia because of all the pictures but that is far from the truth. Now to be fair anatomy by defonition is just listing definitions but the book could have done a better job describing where everything is in relation to other structures in the body. Also more importantly the title says anatomy and physiology and by definition physiology means the function and processes of living organisms which this book did a poor job of doing with the dictionary format it uses.
4,Would have been great!,This basket was exactly what I was looking for but it did not work with my Viking BBQ. The rotissier bar is too big to fit through the small holes and there is no way to adjust it.
5,On time and clean!,"I liked the book. Also liked the fact that it was delivered on time and was a new, clean book. It is a great addition to my 'how to make my home and life better' series!"
4,Great teapot....,"Love this teapot, however the bamboo board that acts as a stand for the teapot arrived split in half at the bottom of the box..."
2,No patterns with digital download!!!!,"Not impressed! The actual Book looks good, but with no pattern???? What's the point????I would print the pattern, which is what I thought I would be able to do.Not happy!"
1,Sew Baby Doll Clothes,I was very dissappointed when I received the book. There were no patterns included and that was the reason for purchasing the book.
3,Not So Great,"I sew doll clothes as a hobby. The Bitty Baby Twins on the cover sold me the book, because I needed patterns for the dolls. However, the paper patterns are a mess to cut out. Many pieces are out of sequence and if you lose one piece (unfortunately like I did), then you can not make a majority of the outfits, because one bodice might be used three times!(No extra pieces are given.) The outfits are very time consuming and not as easy to make as those produced by other companies, like Simplicity. Also, I do not know how to hand smock and some of the clothes called for smocking."
5,Great!,This product works as well as it says it does. My dry skin is soft and looks so healthy. I love it!
1,"'OH PLEASE SPARE US, JADED LADY'!!","'TACKY', IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT, AS A BCR FAN, I SAY TO MS SULLIVAN'GET OVER IT', IS IT ANY WONDER THEY WANT TO SUE HER?SHE OBVIOUSLY DID NOT GET ENOUGH OR EXPECTED TO GO DOWN THE AISLE MORE LIKE IT!! I FOUND THIS BOOK TOTALLY BORING, TACKY AND A PAYBACK TO THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY...OUCH!!! SO SAD TOO BAD."
5,This is a great product,"I love this product. It is a bit pricey, but nothing shines my boots like it and a little goes a long way. It's worth every penny."
1,Beware,"Beware of books in this series. I just finished taking the Custodian I and II exams in Central New York ( March, 2008 ) - 90 questions. I bought the ""School Custodian"" test prep book ( horribly outdated ), the ""Junior Building Custodian"" and the ""Custodian"" books ( interesting but not relevant nor helpful for the test ) and I was ill prepared for the test based on my purchases."
3,seemed very similar to The Baby Whisperer,"The best ideas in this book (in my opinion) seemed to be a rehash of ""Secrets of the Baby Whisperer"" (published in 2002), and I think the plan in Baby Whisperer is easier to follow. I didn't find much else useful in this book, unfortunately."
4,poptarts,"My son loves his pop-tarts, and now didn't have to run around looking for them, just click the mouse!"
3,Well written book about the Italian people,"I enjoyed the book, The Italians. Eventhough Barzini was a newspaper journalist, it seems he was in the business of writing about the social sciences. While reading this book, it dawned on me that many of Barzini's theories and precepts are nothing more than ideas. Of course, Barzini was Italian and I am sure many of his conclusions are accurate. However, some of this book has to be taken with a ""grain of salt"". Barzini, educated at Columbia University, has a witty and thorough style of writing. He makes this book very easy to read and enjoyable. I recommend this book to anyone looking to understand the makeup of the Italian people. It's important to keep one thing in mind before reading this book, it was not written by a sociologist - but by a journalist."
3,Muchos errores gramaticales.,"Aunque el precio es excelente tiene muchos errores tipograficos que hacen la lectura un poco confusa. Cuando lei este libro en escuela superior, mi libro tenia notas al calce que explicaba nombres y/o palabras que no se usan en la actualidad. Esta edicion no tiene notas al calce."
4,Buenisimo,"De manera muy inteligente Calderon de la Barca nos hace entrar en un mundo que va y viene para un afortunado o maldecido hombre, juzgue usted."
2,Much harder than the real test,"That fact in itself is not necessarily a bad thing if your goal is 750-800, but make sure you use other books to fill in the gaps and get a truly realistic impression of the test. I won't comment on mistakes and hasty handwritten solutions posted online, because a newer book by the same author recently came out; I have not worked with it yet.*** Edit ***I have posted this review four years ago. Back then Amazon heeded my complain about a plethora of the glowing reviews to Mr. Meylani books: many of those reviews were written for his various books by the same people; many of those people have not posted any other reviews. The whole bunch of bogus reviews got cleaned out.I can see the avalanche of praise happening again. Buyer beware!"
5,Good Hub,"I've used two of these for my home network for several years. They have been rock solid. It's a 10Base-T network, which is a bit dated by today's standards, but it works for me just fine. I had 12 PCs working off the two hubs and a router at one time."
1,Not worth it,"I received this cream as a gift. Since I don't like wasting things I tried using it even though I was uncomfortable with the origin of the product (Ahava is made from natural resources from the Occupied West Bank by an Israeli business located in an illegal settlement). After using it once or twice I decided the quality was mediocre. For me, the average quality of the cream plus the questionable ethics of the manufacturer makes the use of this or any other Ahava product--even one received as a gift--extremely unappealing."
4,Works well and we are very happy with it,This is lightweight and easy to use. And we don't have to worry about us or our kids walking away and leaving the kettle on and damaging it or our house.
3,alright I guess.,This is very narrow & the head support is a bit complicated to attach at first & hard to put back to fold it all up. Other than that it'a very comfortable & easy to set up.
3,doesn't last long,"initially i really liked this air brush; it was my first air brush purchase. i liked the brush that rotates to release my hair. unfortunately the part that keeps it from rotating ended up stripping. this happened rather quickly, within 6 months. now it doesn't grip; i have to hold the brush portion to keep it from rotating. it's too bad, because if that part hadn't stripped, i imagine it would last for quite some time."
1,Holy cow! Over-rated!,"This book was horrible. It was either too complex, or much too simplistic. There was no measure of explanation on the connections between the various subjects, and no tying in of the various concepts 'learned'... This was bad... DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"
3,A need for a few dollars,"Just needed a few more dollars spent for a qualification. Key chain is ok , nothing special. It worked for me......"
2,Leather Tooling & Carving,"Upon receiving the book, I was NOT too impressed. Although the book had some good ""tid-bits"" of information, it did not stand-up to it's title. (TOOLING & CARVING). About 1/5th of the book covered ""tooling & carving"" VERY LIGHTLY, and the rest were leather-working projects. As a matter of fact, keep in mind that this books copyright date is 1950 - so you can guess at some of the projects. But it is a decent book, and does cover some of the topics ""lightly"". I wish I could find something else to help me raise it to a rating of THREE STARS...but I can't. But as a helpful hint, you cannot go wrong with any of the ""Al Stohlman"" leather-working books. (Look for these, invest in these, be pleased with these). So to end, it's an OK book, but you can invest in a better product. Support your local leather-craft distributers, as they should carry the above mentioned books. (Hey...I bet Amazon.com may carries one or two of ""Al's"" books)."
1,Save your money,"Good concept, poor execution. Had a ""Magic 8 Ball"" as a kid and loved it. This one could be a fun product, but frankly, all the ""excuses"" were just illegible. You just could not read them. Seller was great and offered a refund, but the product was useless. In this case, there just is no excuse (literally). Save your money."
5,"Krosfyah is ""THE BEST"" caribbean group of all time!!!!!","The Ultimate Party-Pump Me Up, is one of the best Albums made by Krosfyah. This CD has 14 wonderful songs- Songs that make you just want to Get Up and Dance. When you play Krosfyah's Music, you cannot sit still. you have to get up and dance. The tempo and the rythum of the songs are truly invigorating. Just to listen to their music is one thing , but to actually see the band perform and see how they can work the crowd and get a 99.7% rate of participation is just fantastic. I highly recommend this CD, as well as all music produced by Krosfyah."
3,Windham Hill Classics: Reflections,"Not your typical ""good"" Windham Hill recording. The samples sounded better than what the actual CD pieces are. A bit disappointed."
5,Not a sellout,"I've heard people say that RHCP is selling out and becoming too commercialized, but I'd say this is one of their best CD's. While they may be a little less, well, funky? they're still producing great music. And maybe they'll continue to get more airplay too. It's a departure from their old stuff, but I think they're just getting better. Listen for yourself..."
5,AWESOME!!!,"This CD is the Chili Peppers best to date!!! By the way surpasses all of their other albums; even BSSM and Californication! It is a little different than their other albums, but still is great!!! Do yourself a favor and buy this CD now!!!"
3,By The Way: They sold out...,"This is the new record of a great band: The Red Hot Chili Peppers. They always tried to show new sounds, new forms of make good music. This new album ""By The Way"" is not a bad album at all, but it sounds like a band that wants desperately to sell a few more millions of records. This is a Pop album, full of soft songs, with some pretty moments, but the magic of the Red Hot Chili Peppers is no longer present like before.If you are a true fan of the band you won't regret buying this and By The Way: They sold out, unfortunetly..."
2,By the Way......this album [stinks],"Very depressed!! Thats how I feel after listening to this CD. If this was the first time I ever heard the RHCPs then I would think that they were a pop sellout band. However, I remember the last 7 albums full of original, rock, rap, and funk. Nobody could play funk rock like the Chili Peppers. Now, I understand that they are almost 40, so I forgive them for not totally rocking out. Where are the funky riffs and rhymes? This album is completely flat and very boring. ""Under the bridge"" was a new direction for the Chili peppers, but they have tried to duplicate it on 12 of the 14 tracks on the Cd and failed miserably. I can't tell you how disappointed I am. This music is supposed to pump you up not mellow you out. At least, I have their last 7 albums."
2,"A bright star burning out,","This album seems to confirm that the Chili Peppers went supernova with BloodSugarSexMagik, and have continued to burn out ever since. Unless they can get back to the down and dirty funk, and explore that region of music again, be prepared for disappointment."
3,"Well, I liked Californication better","I respect the chili peppers attempting to change their sound, and after 20 years of existence, it's about time. But this album, while very appealing to me at first, is just too watered down for my tastes. The top three tracks are ""Tear,"" ""Can't Stop,"" and ""By the Way."""
2,"commercial, melodic, dribble","before the release of this album rhcp said this is the one that they have broken into ""new ground."" i had great expectations for this album and was severely disappointed.this album is very commercial and melodic. it plays too much on being catchy and not enough on the musical intensity these guys played with, like on mothers milk or freaky styley. the solos on the album go absolutely nowhere and flea's bass has no personality on the album. it is subdued and does not drive the songs. the funk is not there, the punk, and elements of thrash have also disappeared. cabron is the only okay song on it because it shows some substance by throwing in other styles of music. and i do like on mercury because when the guys harmonize it sounds almost angelic. but these points will not save the album from a bad review. i now throw them into the same pot with every other ""adult contemporary vh1"" band. this music has no edge!"
1,No So Red Hot Anymore,"Been a fan since the beginning. Gave up on them when Frusciante left. Moved on to different music. Just came back and listened to Blood sugar Sex Magic (Their Opus) and wanted some more, so I bought this one. What the hell Frusciante is with them now. Result - A waste of 14 bucks. This is their worst, as well as one of the most boring albums I have. I'll probably never listen to it again.What's wrong with it?Most of it is ballads/rock anthems - all sung in exactly the same way. Anthony is singing everything the same on this album. The musicianship is lazy, vanilla, safe, and boring.Blood Sugar Sex Magic is as good as these guys will ever get. They should have broken up after that and gone their separate ways. End on a really high note.There is one good song on this album and it still isn't all that great. Can't stop...that has a tiny bit of old Chilis with a new twist. Everything else is radio fodder.I want my money back."
2,70% MAINSTREAM 25%TOO SLOW and 5% RHCP,"I can't believe, that anyone who liked Blood Sugar Sex Magic or older albums of RHCP can identify with By the Way at all.All the great bass lines, drum grooves and guitar excesses have been taken away and are replaced by mellow, minimalistic songs...I am still a big fan of RHCP, but I would never go to a concert of this tour...I can't help it, but this album sounds like as if they lost a bet or something..."
2,Neither Red nor Hot!,"Boring boring boring album. What happened? I'm a fan. I've seen them play tiny, sweaty clubs and huge stadiums. But I'm tired of the sad, slow, listless tracks. Serioulsy. I can't be the only one. These guys used to be funky. They used to rock. They used to have an attitude. They were wild. Now they're tired. I don't want pretty music coming from my chili peppers. Where's the funk? Where's the big sound? Sure, they can ""grow up"" but do it with some energy for crying out loud. The next album better be produced by George Clinton again, or at least have a horn section! Please! Get out of this phase! I need something to bug out to on my house boat! Thank you."
4,More mellow but still very good,This CD is more mellow then their previous CD's. It is a great listen and I would recommend it!
3,not what i expected,"This album is not what i expected. I expected this album to be just like californication which is more heavy and funky.There is only four songs on the album that i like which is BY THE WAY which is a very funky song, THE ZEPHRY SONG which is more of his songs which make you feel like its summer, UNIVERSALLY SPEAKING which has great singing and great vocals and a great chorus, THIS IS THE PLACE which has wierd music. The only song i don't like is CAN'T STOP which has a very old fasion sounding guitar intro and horrible vocals which sound .... overall this album is worth a 7/10 so its worth buying and my opinion may be different to others because the chili peppers did win an award for the worlds greatest band, but all i can say is californication is better, so if you would like to an album by the chilli peppers go buy californication and believe me you won't regret it."
2,"By The Way, Let's Make a CD That's Passionless and Bland...","I'm NOT a big Red Hot Chili Peppers fan for starters, but I do recognize the excellence of many of their past songs. I don't expect them to keep the ""same old style"" from past CDs. I will allow any artist to experiment. The issue I have with this CD is the lack of passion, effort. The overall effect is a sleepy, bland album that is not offensive, but also not motivating. As in the fact that I was not motivated to listen to the CD more than twice. Actually, I was motivated once by the CD -- to sell it!"
4,californication tightened and intensified...,"The new peppers album will disappoint those who funked out to freaky styley and the earlier work of RHCP, but those faithful to the band's ethos and with understanding that change may come will not be disappointed. All the songs are done with punk rock edginess and intensity but the maturity and coherence of the gorup make for mellower song structures. Frusciante is at the top of his game, his riffing and strumming is finger licking good, solidified by the electricity of flea's bass work. Kiedis continues in the vein of californication's 'around the world' and 'scar tissue' with his voice seeped in bittersweet. The mix is strengthened by double tracking of guitars and extensive use of keys time checked by solid percussion backing. By The Way is ambiguous and hard to define, but a beautifully intense and honest piece of work. The peppers maintain their relevance and poise in a music world dominated by emptiness.Fill up on RHCP!..."
2,An opertunity Wasted,This album could of been great following the old rap hip hop rock style but instead they come up with a pop album the only thing close to rap and rock are Miner Thing and Can't stop the other tracks will make you scream!All the tracks are kinda the same the vocalist uses the same tones of voice on every track which gets soo boring.To be fair when i got the album i did think it was alright but this just a 1 hour wonder so i can only give this album a 2 star!
3,"Simply, Disappointing.","This album is easily the worst Chili Peppers album in at least a while. That in mind, the music is decent, and some songs are memorable. But it's not the awesome follow up to the fresh and beautiful Californication of 1999, or the pop-rock-funk-punk fantasticness of Blood Sugar Sex Magic, or Mother's Milk. Some cool songs are ""The Zephyr Song"" (very emoesque), ""Cabron"" (viva california!),""On Mercury"" (ska and tha peppas!), ""Tear"" is ok. ""Minor Thing"" and ""By the Way"" are listenable to as well. Some other songs have more rapping with some decent lyrics, but the melodies fall by the wayside. The conviction and depth to the subjects of californication are gone here, as well as the concept of memorable songs. My advice: Come on peppers, don't become a crap band, release ONLY GOOD material on your next album, and dont rush it, I don't care if it takes another 8 years. This album is about as good as ""One Hot Minute."""
4,Great CD,I am totally impressed with this album! I was a little concerned about buying it after Californication came out. But this album is quality. Almost every song from start to finish could be released. It was definitely not just thrown together. The best song by far is number 7. That one alone is worth the price of the CD! You definitely need to get this album.
2,reach exceeds grasp,"Now that I've had some time to really listen to this, it's not a very good album. There are a few highlights - title track, Dosed, Cabron - but Sgt. Peppers and Pet Sounds are bad role models for this band."
3,Some of the songs are hot,"I'm not a big ""Red Hot Chili Pepper"" fan but this album ain't half bad. It's certainly worth a listen. I love the song and the video ""Can't Stop"""
3,yo,"I've grown with them since mother's milk and BSSM day'sI loved there energy and soul to fill my mind, but after thatthey write, play well, but lost sprituallity to play music,because of they gets older or became business men?,they are coming Japan this summer to play Fuji rock festibal,I saw them the first Fuji rock fesstibal in the typhoon days,it was OK.but no more, this album is too much commercial.I gotta say good bye to them. sorry for my English."
3,Yellow Mellow Bell Peppers,"Blood Sugar Sex Magik was awesome, and even though they lightened up in Californication, it was still an awesome album too. When ""By The Way"" came out, I was excited, cause it was a good song and was ready for a new album! However, I almost threw the CD out my car window the first time listening to it. At first listen I was very disappointed, but listening to it a couple times more, it's a so-so album. There is really nothing special to it. Mother's Milk and Uplift Mofo Party were better albums than this one... It lacks the charisma and chemistry that the other albums had. You can tell that pretty much John Frusciante wrote almost all the songs. It's kind of a depressing album. They should really look into changing their name, cause ""Red Hot"" is not them. I still love these guys, but hey, I guess they were bound to put out a bad one."
2,Fails to impress me!,This is not good chilli peppers music! It's simple- the songs they released from it are excellent and the rest of it is pants! Wait for the greatest hits album out soon- at least you get value for your money
3,Chili Pepers Fans: The funk is dead,"I'm almost speechless at the new album, not because it is so great but because it is not even remotly Reminiscent of the Chili Peppers most of us had loved. Vocally Kiedis is very strong, sounding the best he has ever sounded.Fuciante is somewhat going back to his old, Freaky Styley type playing. However the electronics used on some of his guitar playing remind me almost of radiohead. It was a big shock to find that the bass is almost a silent buzz in the background, flea has definatly lost his upfront in your face funk playing. Chad Smith carries the beat well, but with simple 4/4 patterns, he's truly not living up to his ability. Basically Die hard chili peppers fans have to except the fact that the old peppers are gone and are not coming back, I give this three stars because it is good music, its just not the Chili Peppers."
5,"DEEP, BRILLIANT ALBUM","Red Hot Chili Peppers new CD is proof that Anthony Kiedis & the crew are here to stay,creating songs that are truly excellent and which sound great. I thought it would be very difficult to match the quality of Californication,but they have done it with ease. Yeah,there are quite a few 'mellow' songs,but they are all really creative and you can hear the talent and emotion in the way Kiedis flows with his voice - with Flea,etc,supplying incredible music to go along with his vocals. The more you listen to the CD & soak in all the great songs,the better they get.""By The Way"" is one of the best albums out this year. Highly recommended!!"
3,By The Way....Were popstars now,"After John returned to the Peppers for Califoniacation,it looks like By The Way was gonna be awesome. But it sounds nothing like a Chilli Peppers album. Its sounds like they wanna stay on the pop side for now.If your REAL TRUE DIE HARD FAN then check this one out. But if your into there heavly known funk-punk-rap-rock sound, avoid this..."
2,"Ugh, this isn't funk rock...","What happened to the Chili Peppers? I don't know, they've been popular for many a year but have never been tempted to change their sound for the masses. I guess they changed their minds. I love the funky RHCP from Blood Sugar Sex Magik and Californication, not this bland pop. Unless RHCP changes it's house I guess I'll just listen to their older albums.Don't buy it."
2,"Look at the Turtle Go, Bro!","I thought the Peppers would recover from Californication but it just got worst. Sorry, this cd SUX! I didn't know Lawrence Welk was still alive until I heard this trash. I guess the socks are soo long ago.Fishbone RULES!BROOKLYN S T A N D U P!"
5,Great Music.,"If you want to love a band that never changes, go join the AC/DC fan club. If you want to hear a great CD, buy this one. Yes, they've come a long long way from ""Suck My Kiss"" and BY THE WAY proves it (not that Suck My Kiss was bad...). I listened to this CD with somebody who said the music was ""beautiful"", which is the best descrpition I've heard of it. It is soulful, deep, moving, etc. I loved CALIFORNICATION and was hoping they'd keep going in that direction. They did. Two of my favorites are Cabron (funny)and Dosed, but I like all of the songs here. Some people may like their older stuff better, but if you liked their last album, you won't be dissappointed."
5,Awsome!,This was absolutely wonderful. It was used as background music for a 100th birthday part and it fit in perfectly! It truely is the only big band cd you will ever need!
5,The Bible of Juicing!,"Juicing is definetely a great way of being healthy. Dr Norman Walker lived to be over 110 yrs old and juiced every day. This book is a simple read and gives easy and practical advice into why, how & what to juice.Highly recommended if you want to live a long, healthy & happy life!"
4,grosse madchen wienen nicht,"This movie comes off as a German take on every W.B. teen show,yet still mananges to be quite enjoyable and well directed. Most of the cheesier scenes are due to silly Top 40 Euro-pop music and the ""dorky-yet-dreamy"" schtick of the girls' respective love interests. As for the main characters (Sofi and Kati),the actresses turn in two very impressive performances despite limited experience and pull off a few genuinely touching scenes. Nice one."
5,AL @ PAUL SHOW WHO IS REALLY PST,"Ministry Return with a sledgehammer of their legendary innovative industrial metal, Animositisoina is a cross between their classic Psalm 69 record and their last brilliant the more experimental darkside of the spoon(a fav of hardcore fans). So many bands make music that is pst with no reasons, listen to ministry atleast they have intelligent anger to display in their music and they always will. Thank you Al @ Paul!"
5,"A Charming Story, with Warm and Engaging Illustrations","For Alaskans, this story of ""Benny's Flag"" is part of our history. For others, it offers a unique view into some of the values that shape life in the 49th state. What other place would have a contest for schoolchildren to design the state flag? Benny, who won the contest, wanted to express his love for Alaska in his design, and so he looked to nature for his inspiration. As did the illustrator. The lush and evocative two page paintings bring the reader right into Benny's world, while the author tells the story with simplicity and grace. The warmth of this beautifully illustrated book will draw in adults as well as children."
3,This Secret is Out of the Bag,"As the bowling host at BellaOnline.com, I read everything I can about the game. This book is as basic as they come. It includes a lot of photos that help give understanding, although they are a bit dated.If you have never bowled before, are using a ball without a special composition, drilled normally, you can learn the basics from this little book. Dawson Taylor bowled 194 average om the 50's when that meant something. With today's lane and ball composition, many of the techniques he employs will suffice, but won't really put you in the game."
1,What was the point?,"I'm not sure why this book was even written in the first place. It did nothing to help me get more out of the REAL books it was reviewing. The missing 35 pages was a big error on the part of the graphics contractor, not the author's fault, but was helpful in adding to the frustration. I returned it for a full refund plus got the shipping charge refunded- Amazon returns are easy."
3,World Literature? Or Eurasia and their conquests?,I was curious to know how truly global this mix was so I looked up all of the featured authors and found this mix is represented by continentNorth America - 16%Europe - 61%Asia - 20%Africa - 1%South America - 1%Wow that sure is skewed towards the Europeans! I have a hard time believing that of all the great world literature of all time - only 1% came from Africa or South America.What about the great libraries of Timbuktu!?I want to learn about the world - does anyone know of a compilation that is more globally representative?
3,Fadiman Has Caved,"Even Clifton Fadiman has caved, to the hippies, the yuppies, the politically correct, the Eastern mystics. It is beyond comprehension that a once-tenacious guardian of the gates has sold out. Make no mistake, the heavy-handed liberals hold sway over the contemporary lit scene, and they are not ever going to let go. The great tragedy of it, and what mainstream America doesn't understand (having, in their lust for money and material things, so willingly ceded the cultural and spiritual high ground to the leftists) is that we have given over our most precious birthright to those who neither understand nor value it at all."
5,Great List of Books to Read in your Lifetime,I found this book very useful in continuing not only my general education but also allowing me to read the better works of all time. I have started a book club to read all the books and discuss them...
2,Disappointing contents,"I was drawn to this book because someone said they learned a lot from it even though he had a bichon already (like me). What I learned that was new was almost nil (and I haven't read a lot). Besides, the whole second half of the book is the annoying ""doggie boiler-plate"" info that seemingly gets plopped into all these kinds of books, and is written to be generic for all dog types. What I really want is a book all about bichons, and one that goes beyond confirming that they are great, smart, sensitive, loveable and loving dogs (which they most certainly are!)"
4,Great Product,I loved this stuff from years ago. I still use it. The softness you get from this product is great. My mom used to use this on me 50 years ago. Still great over all other things out there.
3,Anticlimactic...,"An excellend and promissing beginning but the closer to modern era the poorer the coverage. For the coverage after La Violencia I would turn to Palacios' Between Legitimacy and Violence."""
4,Harvest,Just another really good mix of Windam Hill classics by various artists under their label. Not to be missed if you like soft music.
5,Great item,"My 9 month old Golden chewed up her vellux blanket and her fleece crate pad. Got her the X-Large pet Dreams bed for her crate from Amazon, and she has not even tried to chew it. After 1 month, I give it 5 stars!!!"
2,My dog loved chewing this one to little pieces!,"I have gone through many dog beds and I was hoping this would be the one that would last. Unfortunately it wasn't. I have an eighteen month old English Pointer that loves to chew everything, especially her bed while she's in her crate at night. This bed appears to be made well and if your dog doesn't chew on beds this would be a good choice. It fit perfect in her crate and for the short time that it was in one piece, my dog snuggled up in it very comfortably. (I bought it for much less somewhere else)"
5,Pet Dreams Plush Sleep-eez Reversible Dog Bed,"This bed is constructed well. One side is for hotter weather and the other for cooler weather and is very easy to wash and dry. Compared to similar products, the price is very reasonable."
5,Quality CD,"Deborah Coleman makes a strong case for why she ranks among the best of the new female blues artist with this CD riviling the likes of Debbie Davies, Susan Tedeschi, Kris Wiley and Bonnie Rait. Coleman's CD is a mix of soulful numbers, Blues/Rock and Texas Boogie. Two of the best songs on the CD are ""Don't Lie To Me"" ""Nothin' to Do With Love"" and the self-explanatory ""I'm a Woman"". If there is any doubt about this individual's capabilities, catch her live. I gaurantee that after her performance you will want to go right out and buy her CD."
5,Excellent Ring,"I just got my ring and I am really impressed with it. I've searched for a Marquise style ring set, but they are either way to expensive or look fake. This ring looks real and people can not tell the difference. My friends thought that I hit the lottery or something! The center stone is about 2 cts, but the setting makes the whole set believable."
2,Hair improvement,"This product is not the same as the old Wella Kolestral, which would leave hair soft, rich and radiant.This product does not contain lanolin as the old one did. After using this treatment, my hair was not really improved much at all. I used the old Wella Kolestral for over 30 years--This product cannot come near to thequality of the old one.Sharon Hill"
3,Tourist Trap,"Although a few themes are really cool, these guys came off track with this album. It is a very strange mixture of music genres that just doesn't blend in together. It sounds more like a collection of various musicians rather than an album composed by Rob Garza and Eric Hilton.Besides, the album wants to appeal to am intellectual or concerned crowd by dealing with world issues but it does it simplificating it all so much that it really appears like the work of ignorance. The lyrics of one song: ""Exilio"" even got me really mad. It's funny but it appears that Garza and Hilton think that their popularity gives them importance to deal with issues they have no idea of!"
2,"Coming soon, to a hip clothing store near you!","Like that star-studded [cupple dollar] million action-film, Thievery Corporation is one of those things that sounds good in the abstract (or maybe after an initial viewing), yet a closer examination reveals it to be simply mediocre. If only this <<sounded>> as good as it looked on paperImpeccable taste in music (and clothes) does not great music make. You can't fake the bossa nova--and even the dubby stuff sounds conjured. Blandness cuts through this record like a knife, even the collaborators are only blips on the screen. Not even the the beautiful, decadent packaging can save this one.Two stars for the packaging."
5,Excellent for basics,"I love these books. I bought this book because I've found the ""Visually HTML"" book to be so incredibly valuable over the past year when I've dabbled with web pages. It is simple with these books to pick them up, look for what you need and find a straight forward solution/explanation for whatever it is that you're trying to do. The color may seem a bit unnecessary, and perhaps even juvenile to some, but it sure makes the books more enjoyable, and easier to read ... somewhat similar to the old ""spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down!"" If you're already highly proficient at database design, then you don't need this book ... but for anyone just starting out with Access, I highly recommend it!"
4,plug issuses,"this product works great , but the plug for the power do not you may have to tape it to make sure that it stays."
3,Aesthetically nice but...,While I do like the pattern & color...several of the lids are hard to lift off.
3,Love the style but not the tight lids,"The lids on all 4 of the canisters don't fit well. I've been able to make do with 3 of them, they seem to fit better after use. The 4th however, the largest canister - I ended up throwing out the lid because I could not get it to fit at all! It was going to be my cookie jar but now I use the canister to hold my kitchen gadgets. I was able to order seperately a cookie jar in the same style that works perfectly."
4,Good till the end,"Even when they sample the faraway reports of American astronauts or a Russian choir there is something in the flavour of Lemon Jelly (Nick Franglen and Fred Deakin) that is quirkily English. Here, as some boffin belts out on Lost Horizons, their second album, ""All the ducks are swimming in the water, faldaralderaldo, faldaralderaldo."" If this album were an armchair, it would be orange and inflatable. There is nothing exceptional about Lemon Jelly's folky electronica; it doesn't so much push boundaries as graze happily inside them. But it does so beautifully, with a loopy glee that will get you in the end"
1,just as bad as the other one.,"a feeble attempt to substitute humor for good music. two or three good tracks. otherwise annoying. now, please enter that this feedback is not helpful because you disagree."
4,Importantly chill,"LemonJelly's first release was uniquely exotic enough to matter in a sea of faux-experimental electronica. The album is one of the finer examples of when techno can transcend dated confines (and remember in electronic music time goes by much, much faster then other genres) by not becoming a slave to methodical modulations and instead focusing on an all enveloping melodic approach to compliment any fitting percussion."
2,Campbell Hausfeld,"We have used these paint guns to spray sign faces for many years. They changed the opening where the paint is sprayed from to a smaller hole. When I tried to buy the parts I needed, Campbell Hausfeld didn't carry those parts anymore. Now I have 4 paint guns I can't use."
4,This book is a very good book for teenagers to read.,In this book there are a lot of different twisted. Paul Gold is the main charater in the book. He is seventeen and a Senoir in High School. He has a lot going for him right now. But just doesn't have it going on with the ladies. One day he takes a job walking a dog. He finds himself attracted to Zoe Bernstien the dogs owner. The ending of this book is very intersting and this book had a lot of surprizes. I think tis book it great for someone who likes to read about mixed up romances. I would recommend That's My Baby to the younger readers.
3,Thats my baby,I thought the book made a lot of sense when you try and relate it to real life shiznit. ya know.
5,The Real Deal...Just as good as Stay Hungry,"It came before Stay Hungry. People other than the most ardent Twisted Sister fans would not even know about it. But you are here looking at this review, so Twisted Sister must mean something to you. Well let me tell you this...buy this cd right now. The songs are great and rock hard. There are some true classics on this one including the title track, I Am, Ride To Live, Live To Ride, Like A Knife In The Back, and The Kids Are Back. I bought this on a whim and it continues to pay dividends every time I listen to it. Twisted Sister lays the groundwork for Stay Hungry with You Can't Stop Rock and Roll. It is a often overlooked piece of Twisted Sisters catalog. Highly Recommended."
1,"Great Album, Bad Remastering","Buyer beware, this was not remastered from the original master tapes, it was remastered from vinyl. You can hear the slight crackel on ""The Kids Are Back"" at the start of the song, just as the music is building up. My Wife heard it & she don't even have the ear for this sort of thing. Shame, shame on Spitfire."
3,IT'S OKAY FOR AN EARLY ATTEMPT,"Going backwards, this CD is okay at best. The first Twisted Sister cassette/CD I ever got was Love is for Suckers, that was their best work. The CD issued before that was Come out & Play and it was good but a step down. Continuing back, the music is less and less. This CD is okay if you want the complete Twister Sister collection, but as far as fun, good music it's not that great. At least not in my opinion. If you're a TS fan buy it, but don't expect a masterwork."
2,What the Hell Happened,I decided to get this for the bonus tracks but boy something weird going on. I have the Atlantic version and noticed this version has Vinyl cracking sounds on The Kids Are Back. This sounds like it was recorded off Vinyl.
3,Entire Set,"Features & image quality are inconsistent. Best are: Gung Ho, Spitfire, One of Our Aircraft is Missing, Last Chance & Adventures of Tarfu. The rest are forgettable."
1,Heroes of War the Ultimate Dissapointment,"The Heroes of war was the ultimate disappointment as well as the 50 Combat Movie Pack. The movies were vintage all right but not any where close to popular classics. The DVD i tried playing on the AQIOUS Blue Ray player by Sharp and it wouldn't even load correctly. The movies are lame all but a couple. Hope you don't feel like I did, ripped off."
3,Good but sometimes sounds like marketing fluff,"I am fairly impressed with the book. While it does include good information clarifying The different areas of the Middle East and how each differs from the others, all too often it sounds like marketing fluff. Issues such as terrorism and human rights violations, though acknowledged, are often countered with reminders of how large a consumer base is just waiting for international companies."
1,I did not recieve the item,It was empty the box I could'nt see my watch.I like you help me with this item.
1,Stunning memorable movie - saved or destroyed?,"I saw this film once back in 1974, and parts of it are seared into my memory forever more. It is one of the most bizarre films ever and is full of inspired images. I have been wanting to see it again ever since. However, it says the aspect ratio is 1.33:1. Surely Amazon have made a typo here. Could they really have gone to the effort of restoring and transferring it to DVD at last only to butcher it into full-screen? Given the visual impact of this movie, it would suffer more than most from this treatment. Don't even bother to watch such a travesty if this is really the case. If it is widescreen, I will change the rating to 5 stars.4/21/07 There doesn't seem to be a way for me to change the number of stars I gave this. It is a 5* or more, now that I know it to be widescreen."
3,Over-rated,To me 5-star is really over-rated.I am a bit disspointed buying this album after I read so many positive reviews from almost everyone who contributes his/her comments.Not as good as I expected.Very weak song arrangement.Maybe all because it's a low-budget production.
5,made me cry,"love the remake but i will still foreverly prefer the original version, i heard the original version one time and made me wanna cry, god i miss the 70's."
1,Don't waste your money.,"I purchased this video thinking that it would be similar to History Channel's ""America the Story of Us"". This movie had a running time of 88 minutes; during the 45 minutes that I watched it, the narrator repeated many times ""We're going to tell you about the history of the world in 2 hours"" but only managed to talk about the Big Bang Theory in those 45 minutes. I fell asleep so I'm not sure if it ever did mention the rest of the world history."
2,Dense but not very illuminating,"Though it is chocked full of supposedly crystal clear evidence of Opus Dei's evil ways, most of the research is plainly outdated and mostly irrelevant. I tried desperately to read this book with an open mind. Yet Walsh's tone becomes shrill bordering on the infantile with certain phrasing, particularly at the end of the book, not at all hiding his deeply personal hatred for Opus Dei. For a man who left the priesthood, it's hardly surprising that he would have an intellectual problem with celibacy amongst lay men and women. A Catholic group getting political when the Jesuit priest Fr. Drinan spent several terms in Congress? I can't help but find astonishing that a man who used to give out the sacraments to the Faithful could examine another Catholic group through such narrow lenses of supposed ""left"" and ""right"" and could leave almost no material in his ""investigation"" to the actual spiritual content of his subject."
4,"hate crimes, connie's review","Hate crimes by Joyce King was a very interesting piece. I remember when the news of the dragging of a black man in Texas hit Chicago, I was not surprise. It just shows me that racism is not dead and this is how they now deal with racism in the 21st century. I can see the jouralism in this book but after all this is the author's town, plus she is a jouralist so this must have been very emotional for her. Nevertheless, she did do a good job in relating the facts as well as the details of this horrible crime. I got a lot out of this book. The author was very brave in doing this piece being from Texas and all. It lets us all know that racism will never be finish until Jesus comes back."
4,Nice gown but quality of bra/thong is fair,"The product is exactly like what it shows in the picture. The gown is the theme of the set and nicely made. Easy to match with other lingerie. The bra and thong are fair in quality but I got it for 9.60, the gown is worth the price."
5,Asia/TNT styled Bombastic Approach,"1998 release by the British melodic rock band founded by Gary Hughes as lead vocalist and Vinny Burns the guitarist, is quite impressive, passionate, mythic and catchy as well.This fifth album is sort of concept album luring us into medieval mythical wonderland. MARCH OF THE ARSONAUTS, the uplifiting instrumental track opens as graceful as some of the Asia and TNT classics. Gary Huges has such magical talents in vocals managing both ballad-style tracks such as WE RULE THE NIGHT, WONDERLAND, and TILL THE END OF TIME and rock anthems such as RED and SPELLBOUND quite well. Every track is crisp and clear and well balanced in edgy and mellow appeal of the band.Verdict: Late 90s melodic masterpiece.Rating: 96 out of 100Best Fit Mood: Late at Night listening essential.Promotion Tips: The music fits for chivalous and mythically themed movies and games such as Harry Potter Series.Recommended for: Asia, Styx and TNT fans."
4,Step Reebok Circuit Challenge DVD,"I was happy to be able to find this DVD. The sound is slightly off, but it is very usable to work out with."
5,We need to know,"The last 3 chapters of the Men Who Killed Kennedy are hard to find. Originally created by History Channel, they have been dropped from the set they now sell. Perhaps they are too contraversial for their conservative sensibilities.We were happy to watch them. It doesn't matter if you agree or disagree with information, it is good to be allowed to review it and make up your own mind. Thats what freedom is really about.Thank you to the seller. We were thrilled to be able to access this information. Too much has been hidden about the Kennedy assasination. Its about time the people were allowed to think for them selves and form conclusions based on full accesss to the information."
2,How disappointing.,"I eagerly awaited Gail Greeno's next book after finishing the Ghatti's Tale Series. What a truly delightful read. Mind Snare was another story entirely. The characters didn't have the same resonance as the ones from Ghatti's Tale. I found little I had little empathy for Glynn and the relationship established between characters not very well supported.I kept reading the book hoping that it would pull through and at least have a satisfying ending. I found the use of modern references very distracting in the context of the story because it interrupted the content of what Ms. Greeno was aiming for. Only a truly die hard fan or collector should add this to their library. As for me, I'll keep re-reading the Ghatti's Tale and be enthralled again and again."
1,WATERED DOWN !!,"I have used this product for years and very familiar with it's long lasting fragrance and scent. When I first used this product I purchased online though Amazon, I noticed within a half hour, I could no longer smell the scent of the cologne? I continued to use on and off for a couple of weeks and again within a half hour I couldn't even detect the fragrance and friends and family confirmed NO scent at all. I'm completely dissapointed with my purchase and would NOT order Chrome from Azzaro through Amazon again!!I will say in Amazon's defense, they did refund my total purchase for this item ;-)"
5,Hands Down Amazing!!!!,Jodorowsky is the man!!! This box set is amazing the films that he made are cerebral mindbenders. If you watch Holy Mountain and El Topo put your thinking cap on because there is heavy topics of philosophy in the films. La Cravate is great because it reminds me of a Georges Mielies film. Haven't seen Fando y Lis yet but it is a definite must buy if you enjoy films that are more on the artistic side.
5,Gardening Sheer Excellence,"If ever curios as to why or what John Lennon was interested in, this package sums it up into a simply simplistic example:The pure existence of searching for what can be considered as, nothing.For me, love is the only explanation for what I feel for the collection.As for some words of wisdom,well...all that is necessary to say is:JUST WAIT, (for to see is to answer what it is to be)."
1,Agree with 'Had to Be There',"Searched for this movie for so long. When I finally saw it, I couldn't believe I had wasted my time. Not just boring, but obvious and dated. Terribly disappointing."
1,Gross and disgusting!,If I had known this title contained a horrible snake I would never have even opened the cover!! It is my honest opinion that very few people looking for a pleasant read want to read about snakes. I am definitely not impressed with this series. Each title seems to get worse than the one before.
5,Great boots!,"Got these for my wife, and amazingly, they fit. She wears them all the time - they look great, and are actually pretty comfortable!Clarks rock!"
2,heel cap came off,I loved the boots for the 3 times I got to wear them. The heel cap came off of one boot and was lost. A lot of money for that to happen.
1,this is my opinion .........,it stunk i lost all respect for them they even used the NSYNC back ground singers. if i wanted a NSYNC c.d. i would have bought one. did they have nothing better?yuk
4,My Review,"I'm a really really big 'N Sync fan and I was was happy when I heard Alabama was going to record A Little More Time On You, because I also listen to country. To the person that said it was rap, it's not! 'N Sync is pop and this song(when Alabama sings it) is pop AND country. I think its great that they recorded it, but 'N Sync sounds better singing it. Thanks:)"
3,Little Boring,"I got this CD for massage sessions. I thought it would be close to Steve Harplen's ""Gift of Angels"", but it wasn't. There are vocals on track #2, and the CD is only 37 minutes long."
3,Hmm...,"[...] I would like to warn everyone that the explinations in this book are very vauge and he constantly makes asumptions that you know things that you may not. There are more than 2 errors, there are quite a few. For example, there is one question that he solves with a certain exponet to get a certian ratio. I solved it correctly as well, but the ratio is different. The tests range from REALLY hard to moderatly hard. The tests in this book, the author even said so himself, are harder than the real thing, but offer good and semi-realistic practice. The explinations are what give this book a 3. Sometimes, the explination to a tough problem is, ""the requested probobility is in answer C"" or ""all of them but II work"" or ""all of them are possible"". This doesn't help AT ALL! The explinations are too short to be really useful. All in all, a good book with tons of practice. But DON'T rely on this book to teach you the material."
2,"Oh, really?","Sure appears to be a pile 'o crap to me. But I like sci-fi and the X-Files, so the book has some entertainment value, anyway. But really...remote viewing in the new century? Don't make me laugh. I suppose aliens teach eligible viewers how to do it..."
2,difficult reference,Although I found this to be somewhat usefull I thought that many of the questions were not appropriate for a generalist while preparing for the board exam. I was perhaps more frustrated by the number of mistakes that I found in the answer key and explanation section of the text where the answer did not correspond to the letter choice given.
5,Great!!,"I am a all natural mom. I don't take my babes to the doctor for every little fever or cough. Since 85% of all ear ""infections"" are viral, there is no need to go to the doctor everytime. I love that I can see in their ears and make that decision based on my own knowledge. Love love love!!!"
2,cheap and shows,"This product was going to be the backup for at home use. However, the light went out on the second use. I contacted the seller and they sent me a replacement (it didn't fit). Overall very cheap and easy to break."
2,Had better,Yes this is durable and has a nice case but it is very heavy. My other otoscope was much better than this one. You cannot see clearly. I don't know if it is the light not being as bright.
1,Did not work,"After waiting and waiting for the otoscope to arrive, because I wanted to be able to look in my daughters ears to see if she was teething or has a ear infection, it did not work. Tried tons or different batteries. The little light bulb looks cheep. The way it turns on was poorly manufactured. Very frustrating. I would not buy this. I am still not sure what is wrong with it, but with a new little baby I just do not have the time to call and go to the post office and jump through their hoops. These are super expensive at my nearby medical supply shop and now I will get to pay for two of them. Just skip it and save yourself the hassle."
2,"""General Hospital"" in Army green","This is a weak series of books, as far as war novels go. They're more like an ongoing soap opera than gritty war drama (think ""General Hospital"" as a novel, only set between 1945-1970 and revolving around the Army instead of Port Charles.) The characters are given plenty of time to evolve, and some do (Lowell, in particular.) But it all seems too phony. A good war novel should have some truth in it, but it is in short supply with these books."
1,Never worked!,"When I got this product for the first time, the resin bottle was almost empty. So, I contacted the seller, who then resent me a new package. And the second resin bottle was almost empty (it contained only 3-4 drops), too. I read and followed the instructions very carefully but nothing got improved on a small bull's eye on the windshield. I wanted to try another fix (as instructed in the manaual) but no resin was left. I don't think this is a seller's problem because the resin bottles were factory sealed. Everything I experienced indicates that this product is defect."
2,Results may vary.,"The one thing that this product doesn't stress enough is that your results may very depending on the type of damage you have. This product is not very good on star cracks or regular cracks (it may work better on bullseyes). I have a star crack about 1.25"" in diameter with the longest crack extending about 3/4 inch from the point of impact. I've read and fallowed the instructions 3 times and after few tries the product did fill in the small spider web like cracks that extend no longer then 1/4"" from the point of impact but the longer cracks are still there and still visible. The damage does look a little bit better then before the repair but it's definitely nothing like the Before and After picture the manufacturer provides. Honestly I don't really care how it looks as long as it passes the state inspection but I'll find that out in few months.Overall I can only give this product 2 stars, and if you are going to buy this don't expect miracles."
2,Doesn't do a good job,"Poor product. I was dissapointed with the results and will not buy this item ever again. Followed directions, and cracks are maybe only 50% visible now. I was expecting at least 10% visibility when this was done."
2,Not worth the money,It makes the chip look a little better but it doesn't fix it. Its still obvious that there is a chip in the glass
1,CRACKED MY WINDSHIELD!,"OK I bought this item to repair my 84 silverado's windshield. it had minor little cracks on it, so I decided to give this a try.. The tool left a CIRCULAR CRACK around the crack I was trying to repair, and it is really deep. Horrible product!!!"
5,Does what said,"I fixed a Starburst crack in my windshield using this product. At first, I was skeptic about this product or any other windshield repair kit because I didn't see how it could fill or fix something like a starburst crack. I did some research and read other reviews for other products but this was the highest ranking. I did not order this from Amazon, but I purchase it at a local Wal-Mart. Read the instructions and tackle the job. It's pretty easy to use. It did minimize and filled in the starburst crack. Key work is minimize, not make it disappear or make it complete invisible. It clear said that on this package and in the instructions. Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone. It's really easy to use and takes less than 30 mins to complete. It's also reuseable until you're our of resins.It turned me from a person who doubts these kind of products into a believer."
2,Didn't make disappear.,"It didn't make the chip disappear at all. The resin did dry in the hole which is kind of all I was after to help promote less cracking potential. not sure if pleased with results yet.Did research that professional tools fo rthis kind of job are about 500 dollars.so you can imagine how good a 12 dollar one is.i want to add i would personally try a different kit is I was looking for reviews to help make a purchase. as im sure any other cheap kit couldnt be any worse.the main thing in this kit is just the resin. the plastic and the suction cups are just to make the kit look more interesting, while it does serve a small purpose to help push the resin into a chip, it really isnt needed for anything. just putting the resin on the chip will already have no air."
2,Confused and Misled,"Having finished Pimsleur Spanish I and having felt somewhat confident in my progress, I looked forward to Spanish II. I loaded the program and settled back to listen to the next level. I was shocked to hear the conversation, much more advanced than I had anticipated. I listened and tried to follow the conversations in the first segment, Lesson 17, but the conversation was too fast, and the narrator gave very little explanantion. Without a writtten guide, it is very difficult to understand the specific words. What was particularly ironic, there is a detailed explanation of one of the simpler words, but nothing for the more advanced verbs. A very disappointing experience."
3,Too easy for my average 1st grade reader,I bought this book because my son scored at a 42nd percentile for reading and this book is still too easy for him. I'm afraid this will not bring his scores up. The stories are really short but I guess reading is reading.
4,Greatest Hits!,"I bought this album already when it came out last year but didn't feel like reviewing the album until now cause i simply think there aren't so much to say of it. Red Hot Chili Peppers IMO is among the best rock band of the 90's and they have had loads of hits. If you don't have their albums already then this is ofcourse a good collection. Most of the songs are big sellers you probably heard before and most of their hits are included here aswell. The wonderful trademark ""Fortune Faded"" and ""Save the Population"" are new songs, other then that we'll find classics like ""Under the Bridge"" ""Give it Away"" ""My Freinds"" ""Soul to Squeeze"" and ""Scar Tissue"", you name it. The only songs i think should have been included that weren't are ""Aeroplane"" ""RollerCoaster Love"" and ""Zephyr Song"" which is miles better then ""Road Trippin"" from the same album. I'm glad that i bought it, even though i already had most of it. Perhaps this is something for more casual listeners. Overall Recommended."
4,Excellent for Half the CD.....rest is ok....,I so enjoy Red Hot Chili Peppers! The first half of this CD is great and all songs we've heard on the radio! The 2nd part of the CD gets annoying...I'm not sure why but I tend to take it out before it's through playing.
2,What the hell is this ?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!??,"Dear God, this is a load of crap. There's about 5, maybe 6 songs on here that are actually the ""best of"". Do yourself a favour, and buy ""What Hits"" instead. It was everything before they turned into a wuss rock band."
3,DECENT WAY TO KNOW THE PEPPERS...,"This is a decent compilation to introduce your mind to the RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS...All their best hits are here, but i gotta say many many great songs are missing...of course, the disc time is limited, but only MY FRIENDS from ONE HOT MINUTE?????Where is COFFEE SHOP and AEROPLANE???only 1 song from a masterpiece like MOTHER'S MILK???And THE UPLIFT MOFO PARTY PLAN??? Where's BEHIND THE SUN or FIGHT LIKE A BRAVE????Well, this is only a decent way to understand what this great band is all about...try their best albuns MOTHER'S MILK, BLOOD SUGAR SEX MAGIC, ONE HOT MINUTE and CALIFORNICATION..."
5,Magical and masterful performances of the '50s favorites,"Dennis Marcellino's ""Daddy's Home"" is a magical and masterful remake of the'50s favorities ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"", ""Unchained Melody"",""What A Wonderful World"" and ""Daddy's Home"" . A wonderful celebration of the love and joy of family.Madeline Frank,violist,""In Performance"" and ""Madeline's Midnight Melodies"" cds. www.madelinefrankviola.com"
2,Interesting story/literary disappointment,"The reviews seemed to promise something extraordinary, the theme was of great interest, but the reading was a disappointment from the beginning to the end. As an adventure story it was only modestly gripping (unlike, perhaps, ""Endurance""); as a character study I read all but felt I knew none, their inner lives being only sketchily developed. The book displayed scholarly knowledge, and as a development of time and place it was useful. Altogether though, it was a disappointment."
2,Arctic arrogance and melodrama,"After reading other customer and critical reviews I think we need some balance here. I was looking forward to this book and then terribly disappointed when I got into it. What a great idea for a plot! What great research on the setting! What an unbelievable man is Zeke: a devil with a fox on his shoulder. The women tend to be simpletons, so we are left with Erasmus and Ned as the only real people in the book. The plot bogged down in unbelievable detail, and the ending was pure romance novel. Not for me. I am fascinated by writing about the Arctic, but I'll stick with ""Arctic Dreams."""
5,Moving and terrifying,"This is one of the most beautiful books I ever read in my life. It evokes not only the look and feel of the 19th century, and of the Antarctic, but the moral and intellectual climate as well. I couldn't put it down, and when I was done, I felt like a slightly different person, one who knew what it meant to live in that time, and to make those choices. This is a stupendous book: gripping, brilliant, strange, wonderful."
2,Dull writing about a fascinating subject!,"An extremely intersting subject, I found the descriptive passages about the Narwhal's ice-bound polar expedition rather pallid and colorless. It was very difficult relating to these mid-nineteenth century characters who, more often than not, spoke and thought in uncharacteristic nineteenth century speech. Character developent was not only poor but sloppy. Alexandra, Erasmus' amour propre, turns out to be the most interesting person in the novel but is given very meager development and so comes across as a proto-feminist. Erasmus fails to evoke sympathy; he's such a nerd. Zeke is a villain and a rather empty character at that, despite all his bombast. Even the native polar peoples are portrayed as faceless, good-natured stereotypes. A lost opportunity."
3,Didn't really care about the characters...,"Boy, I don't know how to rate this one.At first, I loved it. Then about a chapter into it, I realized this book isneither history or historical fiction. I suddenly became very irritated withit. I vowed to plug on.I unexpectedly got quite caught up in the story (who will survive? who willmarry?) and followed it to the very end.This author writes well. She tells a nice story.But in the end, I didn't really care about the characters (oh, well, heperished in the ice...)This book reminds me of the way I felt about The Corrections. The author isexcellent at copying a paint-by-numbers picture onto another piece of paperand painting in each part the right color. None of the numbers show. Butwhen you look at the picture, you know somehow that it was taken fromsomewhere, that it wasn't drawn from the heart.Does that make any sense?I rate Voyage of the Narwhal a 7"
3,"Good story, but...","The Voyage is a 19th century story told with a 20th century sensibility and style. Written a hundred years ago, the hero would have been Voorhees, the explorer stranded in the arctic and returned a public hero. Instead, today's hero is the Naturalist Erasmus who sees Voorhees for a vain and arrogant fool but is uncomfortable in his own skin, who simmers inside about morality buts commits no action until the tide has turned, who resents the falseness of the world but will take no step to remedy it. Ned and Alexandra were the real heros (in either century!) but they are not the center. Written a hundred years ago, the story would have been a rich, swashbuckling yarn, but in today's style, it is lean and understated and ultimately disappointing. I so much wanted to walk away wow! It seems so many writers would rather we admire their artful minimalism than participate as equals in their real feelings!"
2,Tedious,"Not a bad read, but it pales in comparison to the real thing. I refer to Roland Huntford's ""The Last Place on Earth,"" the story of Scott and Amundsen's race to the South Pole. What a story! Truth is indeed stranger than fiction."
1,Horrible Boring Read,"I was forced to read this book the summer after 9th grade, perhaps you think I am some book hating teen, not true. I love to read but this book was painful to read. It read More like a text book than an adventure novel."
3,I love five of the fifteen songs.,"Californication has its share of lovely, rocked-out hits (the beautiful ""Otherside"" and the title song ""Californication""), but not even all of the hits are very good. ""Scar tissue"" is very boring. It has a bit of a hook, but it doesn't go anywhere special (just like the guys going down a generic desert road in the video for the song). BUT since the Chili Peppers, have done so much for music in the past twenty years by fusing pure get-up-and-groove Funk with straight-up Rock, the mediocrity of Californication is forgivable. The only thing that isn't forgivable is their horrendous video for Californication, which features the guys in a horribly-rendered computer-generated mess. It was meant to look a modern video game, but the effects, which were done just five years ago, are awful. What a misstep.My grade for Californication: C"
3,An Average CD,"I bought this CD after listening to ""Otherside"" many times on the radio. I had also previously watched ""Behind the Music"" and heard the song ""Scar Tissue."" I really had no intrest in the band, and was suprised ""Otherside"" was by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. So, then I shrugged and rode my Go ped over to Sam Goody, where I bought the CD. Long story short, I listened to it once and never again. I figured out that I could have got the song on MP3, and would have been happy.My rating: 2.5 stars are for ""Otherside"" .5 stars for the tight CD cover"
2,Overrated,"I have no idea why everybody likes this record. It's boring, slightly annoying, and only occasionally rock'n roll. Fans only."
2,Far from the Peppers' best.,"I've loved the Peppers for more than 10 years, and this album is a big disappointment. There are exactly 5 good songs on it: ""Scar Tissue,"" ""Otherside,"" ""Californication,"" ""This Velvet Glove,"" and ""Road Trippin'."" The rest are either mediocre (""Around the World,"" ""Easily"") or flat-out suck (""I Like Dirt,"" ""Savior,"" ""Right on Time,"" etc.) The best Chili Peppers albums are Mother's Milk and Uplift Mofo Party Plan. They're just killer. Blood Sugar rounds out their top 3 albums. But even with Frusciante's return, the Peppers drop the ball on this tepid release."
2,YAWN...,"Another album from the always overrated (and musically untalented) Red Hot Chili Peppers. That's all that can be said. Same sound, same irritating pseudo-hip lyrics, all around just the same as any of their other albums. All the popularity of this band is their trendiness (chicks dig Anthony Kiedis) but that's not a reason to buy someone's music. Yes, their radio interviews are extremely amusing, but mundane lyrics (Some of the songs, Kiedis makes unintelligle sounds when he can't think of anything else to sing), and a shot at psychodelic revival can't save this album. If you want the good stuff, listen to Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Now THAT was good."
1,I Was Disappointed,"I bought this CD hoping to have another great pepper album. I think that it is close to there worst albums. Only by this one if your a true hardcore fan, but other than that stay away I plan to sell mine back to Karma."
1,P.O.S.,"the place where I work has this album on an ipodthat plays continuously - along with about 250 othersongs. Whenever anything from this lp comes on, I wantto kill myself. This is lazy music people! crapola."
4,"i give this cd 4 stars, it is of exellent quallity.",This cd was recomended to me by a friend of mine and i would gladly recomend it. It is a cd for many age gropes but i would say you would have had to listen to other of there music before.
4,A good cd to have,"I guess the reason i gave this chili peppers cd 4 stars was because the first 4 songs are great, stuff that you'd buy a cd for, but the rest are kinda dissapointing. Don't get me wrong, I think this cd is great, but only the first 4 songs on it do any justice."
3,"Hey wait a minute!- Its very good, but not great.","I think that people are so excited to have John Frusciante in the Peppers that they are reacting as much to that as to what they are hearing. The album is very good, not great. Its about the same as ONE HOT MINUTE. Does Frusciante's return mean that much? The live show will be the true test."
2,"Eh, overated",It's a shame such talented musicians could make such bland radio friendly pap. Parallel universe and californication are the only standout tracks. The rest of it plays like a bad self parody. Get Blood sugar sex magick of even better one of john frusciante's solo albums.
4,"Interesting ""comeback""","so most people who bought this album saw scar tissue or californication on tv. thats why i bought it. i already had BSSM but i wasnt sure if this was going to be different. After listening to the cd i was shocked at how good this band really were i mean a lot of people had to be dissapointed because not every track had the pop hooks of parallel universe or californication but every track was unique in itself. I think this was a great frusciante comeback the blues was incredible. plus i really like the jams, they are the best part of the cd (end of savior). im willing to keep getting their albums"
2,Snore..............,"I was expecting a lot from this album after a bit of an abscence from the musical stage. This album did not deliver. The only real good song was the first single ""Scar Tissue"". The other songs are very tedious to listen to. They lost a lot of the hardcore funk they used to have which is brought out a bit in ""Around the World"", but the song is hardly catchy at all. The other singles ""Otherside"" and ""Californication"" are very boring and offer nothing to do with the Red Hot Chili Peppers of the past. And Flea, one of the best bass players ever, fails to even show a glimpse of his talent in any song. If you're going to buy a RHCP Cd, get a different one than this."
5,This album rocks!,"I don't know why, but I was never really a RHCP fan until I heard this CD. Shit, I couldn't believe what I was missin, including all their old shit. I'm a huge Chili Peppers fan now. This CD is definitly worth buying."
4,Where's the good funk,"Okay....Everyone is going to say this is a great album. I'd say its a great album, but not incredible. Most of the songs here are great (""scar tissue"", ""californication"", ""road trippin"") You know. The only problem is that it lacks their signature funk style. Damn....I miss it. The only song that satisfies that need is ""I like dirt"". The other attempted funk songs aren't very good (""get on top"" ""emmit remmus"")..ICK Oh well, what can you do. I guess they've changed their style. I like the new direction, but i'm still holding on to ""Give it Away, and ""suck my kiss""."
4,A revelation,"I've always kind of taken the Chili Peppers for granted. Liked some of what I heard on the radio but never enough to spend the cash for one of their CDs. I borrowed this from a friend at work and have been playing it non stop for 3 days.Still funky, still hard, but with a depth of soul and feeling and that wasn't apparent before. The creative sparks fly. Flea's bass playing is as wicked as ever. John Fruscante is clearly inspired by reuniting with his old mates. And Anthony's voice is stronger and more dynamic than ever. He screams, he raps, he yells, he whispers.A really beautiful album with a burnished sadness to it. But NOT depressing. It still rocks."
4,Changed,"At first, it seemed the band whose music had put some spice into all those bland homework hours had gone soft. But after listening to their new album, I realized ""Californication"" was just an addition to the wide Red Hot Chile Peppers experience. This album is mellower, but its messege is stronger. However they choose to push their passion - whether it be by growling distortion or soft acoustic picking - RHCP hits the spot."
2,OK......but no Blood Sugar Sex Magik,"ok.....the chili peppers are back, but they seemed to have forgotten about the great heavy funk sound that got them where they are today. instead, they've tried to make 15 more versions of ""under the bridge""....none of which stack up to the original. only two tracks -""parallel universe"" and ""emit remmus"" show any signs of vintage red hot chili peppers. all the other tracks have some decent melodies, but all in all, its either proof that the peppers are getting old or are looking to pad their bank accounts."
2,A bit of a disappointment - but has some high points,"I've never been much of a Chili Peppers fan but I bought this CD because I liked Scar Tissue and the title track (even thought I think people will agree with me that ""californication"" was far overplayed on the radio). I was hoping that the rest of the tracks would be as mainstream oriented and well-crafted as these tracks but unfortunately, they aren't quite as catchy. The songs have most of the right elements but don't seem like much effort was put into making them sound as good as they could. Still, Otherside, Parallel Universe, and All Around the World are high points. In all honesty, I don't have much chili peppers experience to base my opinions on so I find it likely that fans would find much more in this album than I did."
4,Bring on the Peppers!,"This is my first and only Red Hot Chili Peppers album, and it is awesome. I love the funky beats of Around the World and the more melodramatic lyrics of Scar Tissue and The Other Side. Anthony's voice really stands out and added to their great tunes, they combine to make a fantastic CD. If you have not given the Peppers a chance, take it on this album, it's worth every cent!"
4,Puts bizkit in the basket,A funky combination of bass lines and guitar riffs that puts the Peppers back on the map. Good listening.
3,"Shows promise, but overall it's disappointing.","Nothing particularly inspiring or innovative on this L.P. Flea plays well as ever but the vocals/lyrics are just plain boring. I really don't see how anyone, if you took ""Red Hot Chili Peppers"" off the front of the album, could give this CD 5 out 5."
4,"A change of direction, but still RHCP.","If you're looking for the same RHCP that wrote Blood Sugar Sex Magic and One Hot Mnute, you won't find them: this is a band that have taken a few years out and seriously changed direction, coming out with some mature, collected musings, as opposed to some of the boyish, sexually frenetic tunes of earlier albums. The overall tone of the album is mellower and shows the band's growing experience over the last decade. I confess I was hoping for more of the same, but that would have been unreasonable to expect artistically of the band and I wasn't disappointed to hear the progression... definitely worth a listen, even if you haven't liked previous albums, unless you really _do_ want out and out rock."
3,A milder chili pepper,"As an old Chili Pepper fan, i found this album to be alright; not exceptional, but not bad. Californication is lacking from the original Chili Pepper funk that they did so well in ""Blood Sugar Sex Magik."" If you like Californication the song, then you will most likely love the album, but if you are in search for more of what brought America to love the Chili Peppers, you may be disappointed that you spent nearly 20 dollars."
5,Awesome,"I am not what you would call a huge fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers but I could not help buy this cd after hearing songs like ""Scar Tissue"", ""Otherside"" and ""Californication"" so many times. The songs are melodic and catchy. Getting them out of my head is impossible. This cd is an excellent alternative to anything by Limp Bizkit and Creed."
5,Required Listening,"`Californication' is easily one of RHCP best albums and even after all these years it still sounds fresh. With Frusciante back in the fold and Rick Rubin producing you knew this was going to be something good and you aren't left disappointed. With amazing tracks like `Parallel Universe', `Scar Tissue' the title track `Californication' and the excellent `Road Trippin', this album shows the harder and softer side of RHCP and how diverse they can actually be. This album, with `By The Way', is rarely out of my stereo during the summer and they are the perfect soundtrack to those brighter months. Fun music to put a smile on your face and get you pumped up, what more could you ask for. Well worth a try if you liked their other stuff and a good first place to go if you're new to the band. It deserves all the accolades it gets.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
5,The big Comeback,"After experimenting with guitarist Dave Navarro On One hot Minute the RHCP come back with guitar god Mr. frusciante who's amazing talent is a strong force in the band. to me its one of my favorite albums due to its strong funk grooves and badass rock, I can listen to the album from beginning to end without a problem I Love RHCP.!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,FANTASTIC WORTH MORE THAN 5 STARS,"This was one of the better albums I heard from the band. It has a variety of great songs, from Get on top to Road Trippin'. I dont see how anyone could not like this. i sit and listen to this for hours yet it seems like minutes. this was so great because it made me feel great and has some awesome bass and guitar riffs"
5,WOW!!!!!,"Sherrie Austin has the most beautiful voice that she puts me in a trance every time I hear her. I don't know what it is but she just seems to draw you into her songs. She is the future of country music and, I believe, music in general. Great job Sherrie, keep up the amazing work."
2,wrong edition but will still work. in good condition,wrong edition but will still work. the book i did receive is in good shape

4,Swinging Sounds from Far Out London Town!,"Forget about the Spice Girls, Emma's vocals and lush orchestral arrangements channel the spirit of 60's Brit girls of the Top 40. Evoking lounge, pop and bossa nova Emma sounds a bit like Olivia Newton John with Austin Powers directing her band. Yeah baby."
5,Nice Item,"This is a nice little item. I have used it for a couple of days only, so I can't comment on durability, but it does a great job of heating my office (about 230 sq ft). I've had it on the highest temperature and the ""high"" fan setting for about 2 hours, and it is quite warm now, like nap-time warm. So far worth every penny."
3,It's just ok.,"We had a difficult time assembling this rocker and while I love the look of it, it's not very comfortable even with the padding. Hard on the tush."
4,jazz-rock middle-east fusion,"Good CD. Some songs are jazzy (such as Why-Y), with a middle eastern feel. Oy Vey is very klezmer sounding. Deror Yik'ra and Zumzum have a very middle-eastern sound. One song has the great highland bagpipe in it (Go-Go).Just FYI: This is an instrumental CD (no vocals), contrary to what the other reviewer said. However my CD has a slightly different cover (it does not have the hebrew letters on the right hand side). So I wonder if the version being sold here has vocals (doubt it though).Also, my CD has the tracks in a slightly different order:1. Deror Yik'ra 2. Go-Go 3. Turkish Western 4. The Iraqis 5. Oy Vey (Stoliner Nigun) 6. Night Sail 7. Monkey's Paradise 8. Zumzum 9. Why-Y 10. Deep in the Sea"
5,Excellent for young & old,This video is as great as Volume 1. Our 2 year old grandson absolutely loves this and we enjoy watching it with him. It has enough things geared to his attention and it's enjoyable education. Great job John Deere.
1,The cover,"I have not read this book but I gave it a ""one"" because the cover photo shows the attire worn by the women in INDIA rather than in IRAN.Was it choosen because of the ""persian carpet"" rather than the""Persian bride"" ??"
2,Not a fun read,"This book was clearly written for academics. It is very dense, and uses needlessly opaque language. I realize that history buffs may find this insightful, but as someone not already familiar with Mexican history, I found this to be irritatingly difficult to unpack. This was assigned reading for a history class I took, and I toiled through every chapter. Mercifully, we were also assignedThe Mexico Reader: History, Culture, Politics (The Latin America Readers), which was WAY more engaging.This was not an enjoyable introduction to Mexico."
1,Item received not as pictured - bad customer service,I ordered 2 of these shirts assuming they would be green as pictured - nothing on the web site indicated it would come in another color. When I got them..they were purple. These were for T-ball and did not match the team shirts. Called the customer service department to get the RAN number to do the return and got voicemail. Left a message explaining the situation and that I needed a RAN number to do the return. No one ever called back. I'm Very disappointed all the way around.
4,Beautiful,It was great to finally see a Peter Pan soundtrack that was all instrumental after searching for so long. The music is absolutely beautiful and just what I had been looking for. If you like classical music the songs are really pretty and easy listening. It was a shame that there aren't more tracks.
3,Good adventure information,"This book had excellent information in it, but some of the formating is hard to understand. Also, it is vague in where hotels are located at and without a lot of maps in the book it's hard to figure out where different places are in reference to other places. Maybe, Adventure guide implies that it is focuses mostly on adventure, but I think that budget hotels ($10 and Under) are an adventure in themselves, when I plan a trip I want some more information about what the budget hotel consists of ( Little things that give it charm, hot water, cleanliness, ect..) Overall good information about the culture and osa pennisula."
2,"They're no Intense Mutilation, but...........","they certainly were interesting. A lot of their style was already being done by the NYC trio, Intense Mutilation and GG Allin. And done better. But they were funny, at least back in the 80s."
3,Worth it but...,"Most of the songs are generic metal format with disgusting, filthy lyrics. If you've ever heard the Mentors, you know that, others be warned.Once you get over the lyrics, Golden Showers is the best song by far. What's-his-name shreds on guitar, too bad he played with this band.It's worth buying for Golden Showers alone, but please don't play this around your mother. If you play this for your girlfriend she will leave you, which might not be a bad thing."
2,Annoying and Boring,"Stephen Fry demonstrated he had talent to re-write classics in his very entertaining ""The Stars' Tennis Balls,"" and his good friend and colleague Hugh Laurie proved that actors could in fact spell and punctuate in the competent and entertaining ""The Gun Seller."" Because of the two books I decided to read ""The Hippopotamus,"" hoping to be entertained.The back of the cover reads: ""Ted Wallace is an old, sour, womanising, cantankerous, whisky-sodden beast of a failed poet and drama critic, but he has his faults too."" This is the best writing you will find in this book, which is to say there isn't any good writing in the book. It feels long and ponderous, and there really isn't a plot -- just a lot of that annoying British self-mockery that wears out its welcome by page 10."
1,A waste of time,"I have spent over ten hours trying to get the the Toro 51500 Universal Leaf Collector with 8-Foot Hose to stay on the bucket. First I had to use a tie wrap to keep the black hose in the cloth cover. After doing that, I had to buy a bunge cord to hold the cover on the bucket. Again to no avail!! No place for the air to go so it push the cloth cover out from under the bunge cord. The 15 holes in the bottom are not sufficient. I do not believe these items were meants to be used together and I have yet to figure out what the leaf collector is supposed to attach to.This total purchase was a complete waste of money!!"
4,Good match for Toro blower/vac and leaf collection system,"Bucket is good quality, compacts for storage.Good match when used with Toro ultra electric blower/vac (#51599) and Toro Universal Leaf Collector (#51500).Bucket compacts to a small size and is well made.One negative: when used with Toro Leaf Collector, this covers the upper handles, making bucket hard to maneuver. It really needs mid-mounted fabric handles for this configuration."
3,Smaller than the photos,"thought it was bigger does not hold a large leaf bag, the photo makes it look larger. it does work ok"
5,Toro Gardening Buckets,"I love my collapsible Toro Gardening Totes. As a Master Gardener I find these invaluable to the amount of clearing out and hauling away that I to do at the end of the growing season, as since I live in North Dakota, there's plenty of that to do as we don't have a large variety of perennials that can make it through the winter and I like LOTS of plants and color during our short growing season. I initially bought 4 of these totes and plan on buying 4 more next year."
3,Pretty damn good,"This is pretty good video. But, it doesn't have him fighting HHH or Rocky Maivia like it does on the back of the cover. And the special interview that shows us a side of The Undertaker that we've never seen? Where was that? Obivously, something that we never will see obviously. Other than that, it's pretty good. But, they should've focused on his World Championship reing in 1997 aswell.Or they should of also showed clips from his match with Stone Cold as ""A Cold Day in Hell"""
4,"Okay video, Should show entire match","This is a great video, but I think they should have shown the entire matches. They should have not let that old guy do the narrorating. That killed the movie. After Mankind Hell in a cell, you lose interest. Great ending though, I MEAN GREAT! It was the ending that saved the movie form only 2 stars. Can't wait for the X-Pac video, THEY ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT X-PAC'S ENTIRE CAREER!!!!"
4,Good Purchase,"I received this item in a timely fashion, and it came it good quality. There were a few marks in the book, but they were few and barely noticeable. Overall, this was a good purchase at a reasonable price. This book was a favorite of mine when I was a kid, and I was glad to receive a copy that I could read over and over again."
5,Excellent transaction,I found the monitor to be an exceptional value. It arrived quickly in perfect condition. I would definetly purchase from this sist again.
3,Good vacation read,This was a quick and easy vacation read. I found the climax at little too far fetched but overall it was an enjoyable book.
3,Still worth the money,However I don't think that I would be buying any more from this writer as the plots are too and who done it is predictable.
5,A great series,"Grab this book at the cheap used price for a great read and then go on and buy the rest of his books. This is almost a new genre like the Florida crazy group, only it is in Kansas."
5,Graphically detailed knowledge source,"The print and colors are rich with exact duplication of real time positions thru each page. Walking each page gives immediate sense of where and how. There are formulas for cells and other things such as cell linking and 3d charting that add power for spreadsheets, this book makes Excel 2003 knowledge easier to learn."
5,Waltz Across Texas,All the songs on this CD are rated with 5 stars. I really can't pick just one song. It is just fantastic.
1,"Runs slow, won't keep time",I've owned my Victorinox Swiss Army watch for about 2 months. It was a gift given to me brand new in the box. It is the first watch I've owned since 1980 that will not keep time. I wouldn't have one of these and glad I didn't give any of my money for it. Loses 3-5 minutes a day. I will be buying a new ( different brand) watch as I need a more accurate watch. This is outrageous given the cost of these watches!
2,"Totally unrealistic ""love"" story!","I read Shade of the Maple because of the reader reviews here on Amazon.com and was totally disappointed. I found the story to be very shallow. The lead characters had no flaws and were totally unrealistic and, I thought, poorly developed. I just never believed the story. The explanation of the break up was just too simple."
1,worst book I ever finished,"I really disliked this book. This is not my idea of romance or love; it was sticky, sugary sweet. It also has to be one of the most poorly written books I've ever come into contact with. It is full of gratuitous (and eventually, very annoying) sentence fragments, characters flatter than Kansas, and descriptions of everything possible for no apparent reason. Stay away..."
3,If you can buy that type of love it's wonderful but...,"I found the book unbelievable and wish I hadn't been swayed by a customer rating of this book to choose this instead of The Dive from Dawson's Creek. However, it is a quick and romantic read and part of your purchase price goes for breast cancer reasearch."
4,Teamup International Rc car Body Shell,Teamup International Rc car Body Shell:Nice shell but the photo is slightly inaccurate. The item pictured is not what is being sold. It doesn't have the longer front nose with the black lower valance. That photo is of a bodyshell that is long discontinued
5,THE GREATEST CLAMPS ON EARTH !,"Having so many of Bessey's shows I did not go wrong by buying quantity with quality that will last a lifetime. I do own some cheaper clamps and on the wooden handles the rivets stick out cutting into your hand while tightening. Don't go cheap on the first clamps like I did, buy quality."
3,"Good compilation, but not salvation.","For the most part it is a pretty good selection of songs. However not as good as the past Crow Soundtracks. Several songs on this CD have already been released on other albums but are remixed here and worth listening to. And unfortunately some of the music...wont be making the way to the top 10. All in all I am not sorry I bought it, but it could have been better to."
2,Disappointed,"Avoid this album if you want to listen to the anthems with genuine arrangements. Most of the pieces are awfully arranged. Some of the anthems like Egypt, Bulgaria are no longer of their official ones. Russian anthem is also incorrect - unbelievable! from where did the editor of this album got information? Only the performance of the band is nice if you enjoy the pieces as ordinal brass music."
1,The Best Part of This Album...,"There is some metal out there that is actually good. This isn't an example of it. However, if you can find the album on vinyl you've got something. There was a poster in the album in the likeness of the album cover, and that was worth ownng."
3,3 stars is just about enough,"Well since I haven't seen all of these events, it was nice enough to see the highlights of them. But over all, it was good."
1,It's okay. (yeah right)!,I thought the video would've been better if they would've shown more wrestling than talking. I wanted to see some wrestling. Over all the video was stunk!
3,Not Just for Dogs,"I thought the first part of the book was great. She talked about history of dogs, how to care for them, and nutrition. I scanned through the recipes and noticed that there was not any nutritional information. Also, most of the recipes were more for humans not dogs. And the onions!I tried the first recipe for the teeth cleaning biscuits. WOW the dogs loved them. BUT she forgot to tell you what the do with the parsley. I mixed it with the flour the first time. That was ok, but mixed it with the liquids the second and found that much easier to work with. My suggestion is if the dog is big, make the biscuits bigger. We gave one to a black lab and he did a chomp chomp swallow. Didn't help his teeth!I am going to try some of the other recipes that are obviously just for dogs. Then maybe some of the others that look more human orientated."
5,Great Item!,I am very pleased with this book. It is in excellent condition for a used book. The shipping was very quick. I would definitely deal with this seller again in the future.
3,38x32 waist size not correct,The waist was maybe 36 and much smaller compared with another 38x32 Lee jeans with regular fit and straight leg.
2,Type Levi and get Lee,I searched for Levi 511 jeans and orderd the first pair that came up. Come to find out the first pair that comes up is Lee!! So I'm sending back and can you better filter you searches when I type a specific item the competitor doesn't come up first
3,Has to be wrong size...,"I have owned numerous pairs of Lee Carpenter pants, but this is my first shot at the regular fit. All my other pairs are either 33/34 waist and 32 length...so I ordered a 34/32, but I swear it must be a 32/34 instead. They were a good 3 inches too long and I couldn't even get them around my waist. Besides not fitting, they looked fine."
1,"Lee Men's Regular Fit Jean, Walnut, 34x32","El 10 de Febrero se realizo la compra y aún no llega al casillero en miami, increible como fue enviado en burro"
2,Fit is too tight,"These jeans hug your legs almost like women's jeans. They're also uncomfortable to sit in. If you really want to try them, I recommend buying one size larger than you normally wear."
4,nice jeans,"these are a great color and fit well. i deducted one star because they are not made of as heavy weight material as my lee regular fit blue jeans, but it has held up well so far after around a dozen washes."
3,hard to get the color you want,"I had already bought a pair of lee jeans and didn't care for the finish,the color description was totally different but they were very close to the same. I have been buying Lee jeans for a very long time and have never been able to get the color that I had ordered the time before."
4,Half of this is great ...,"I saw Cabaret Voltaire perform Western Mantra live in Hammersmith, around 1980. It was one of the most awe-inspiring musical events I've ever seen, and the version here is almost good enough to live up to that night. Unfortunately, Eastern Mantra is crap, but the album is worth buying anyway."
3,Complex... too complex.,"William Saroyan's The Human Comedy is quite a complex novel. There are numerous subplots and stories woven into this novel, which put the reader into a state of confusion, as it is very hard to keep track of everything that is going on. New chapters and new scenes occur every couple of pages, preventing any fluency from being established. Saroyan is one of America's truly great authors, and is an expert story-teller. However, his wisdom and talent is very much diluted in The Human Comedy by its extremet complexity. His command of the language and ability to convey feelings through words is remarkable, but this novel does not speak to his skill of writing books that a reader can truly keep up with and fully understand. Nonetheless, despite the cloud of confusion created by this novel, there are many strong lessons and morals beneath the surface of The Human Comedy and for this Saroyan should be commended."
5,WOW! CLASSIC!,O.K. I am a 24 year old college student/us army vet and this book was and is my favorite. I first read this thoughtful and hilarious (odd but it pulls both off easily) work at 14. Since then I seem to read it again almost once yearly. Now contrary to some reveiwers of this book I hardly ever sit and read books for pleasure. The Human Comedy is one of the exeptions to this rule. If you can relate to growing up poor but still finding life wonderful this book is a must read. The main thought/theme is about the war and and its effects on small town america but specifically the Macualy family. For all soldiers or former soldiers it gives an acuarate potrait of life at home during a war. How family life must go on and how wonderfull and painful the experiences are living in times of conflict. My reveiw will not nearly touch all the different plot lines and characters in this short but classic work. Just read it for yourself and I know you will love it.
1,Faulty Description,"The Amazon catalog page in December 2012 calls these 'Standard to Modular.' However, the item pictured is 'Modular to Standard.' Silly me, I ordered four of them because I have four old phones that I want to plug into new outlets."
3,Cooks Really well,"I've been using a cast iron grill pan for years until it started to rust, I got tired of wrestling with it and scrubbing it. I really like the performance of this pan. Lighter, and much easier cleanup. Only one very large problem. The handle won't stay tight where it meets the pan. Not an up/down issue but side to side. I screwed the nut down with all of my strength and it still is a bit loose. Also the sides could be a little higher to cut down splatter. If not for those two defects in manufacturing and design, I certainly give it a 5 star rating."
4,1960's revisited,"Those who wish to look back at the 'news happenings' of the mid to late 60s will find this venturing. Some of this is news (current then) samplings interwoven with a simple music beat to give a hypnotic feel and sense. Musically in itself is nothing dramatically unusual. But giving the ""news sampling tape looping apparents"" will give this collage tapestry a feel. Different music study direction and creation themework. Can inspired collage music ideas. Old lp cover reminds of old 'TOTAL' cereal package, with ""Shure Theater"" printed in upper right center in inverted white triangle of lp cover. lp produced apparently in Claymont, DE."
4,Electrifying,"This instrumental version of Bizet's score is highly listenable--fresh, lively, contemporary. It puts a new wrinkle in a familiar work. Recommended, but Rozhdestvensky's Bolshoi Theater Orch rendition originally issued on Angel vinyl is preferred--a CD reissue of that original LP would be even more highly welcomed."
2,better on paper,this is a little hard to look at on a kindle -it is more of a reference book which means you have specific places you want to turn to and until you have read and bookmarked everything its not user friendly in this format.
4,Very Good Tape,This was a very good tape. It shows these matches: Andre vs Hogan Rockers Mnakind vs Undertaker Mankind vs Kane Steve Austin vs Bret Hart Steve Austin vs Owen Hart Shwan Micaels vs Bret Hart Undetaker vs Hulk Hogan Undertaker vs Yokozuna Bret Hart vs Bob Backlund Shawn Michael's team vs bret Hart's team Undertaker debut Bam Bam vs Goldust The good thing about these matches is it only showed the good parts of these matches. Probably the best mathces were Mankind vs Kane Michaels vs Hart Austin vs Hart It also shows never before seen footage of the Hart-Michaels match. The only bad point is it should mostly new stuff and the tape was a little short. I Still recomend it though
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
3,Shallow beginners book,"If you have limited Visio or VBA experience, this book might be worth the money. But if you have worked with Visio for a while, have written VBA code in other applications, and you know how to use MSDN, spend your money elsewhere.This book only touches basics of Visio VBA, it doesn't show any brilliant, heavyweight techniques."
5,A great book,I read this book with delight in the way the author explained the story of the fisherman. I found this book was much deeper than the waters off Maine. It deals with decisions in life. Everytime Lucky got the chance to make a decision he has a knack for making the wrong one. But there were exceptions such as when it came to his unborn child or his daughter needing help when ready to go to college. It also looks at how people operate in certain patterns in their decisions and how a family often falls apart as a result of a string of poor choices. There is much to be learned from the pages of this book plus it's just a wonderful story about how life in a harsh environment molds people over time.
2,Darwin's Demise & his garbage of nonfacts,"Hey all you athiest.Ken Ham knows his facts.Ken points outmany facts that shoot evolution down.Your pride prevents youfrom learning the truth over evolution.Wake up & smell the coffee.I went through public schools also,had evolution shoveddown my throat.When I became a christian,I discovered Ken Ham.He is an educational scholar.I urge you to look up materialby Ken Ham & read what he says.Darwin did not have enoughinfo to prove his theory. I like Joe White too."
4,Packed with valuable information,"The authors do a great job of collecting a large amount of secular data from scientists from around the globe to refute evolution. They provide a great deal of data in a small number of pages. Plus, it is easily accessible for those who don't have a background in science. This is an excellent introduction into the refuting the distortions, dishonesty and hoaxes that are the foundation of evoltuion.Another similar read is Hanegraaff's book The FACE that demonstrates the farce of evolution."
4,Instigate my feet to dance,"With a touch of his old band OLD 97'S, and a smidgen of Westerburg. Rhett succeeds as a solo artist. I TOTALLY disagree with the other reviewer, this is not a lay down and go to sleep CD. Its a pop the top on a brew, kick back and enjoy the party CD.If ""point Shirley"" isn't a hit... .Also the punky flavored ""four eyed girl"" just kicks ... .Even the corny love song ""hover"" is irresistible.The full tilt rockabilly ""the EL"" just soars.""I want to live is just boogie woogie rock and roll.This CD may just be a 5 star effort. I think repeated listening is in order."
1,Disappointing,"Most of the songs are forgettable, and the lyrics are subpar for Rhett. The production feels all wrong to me... it attempts to be slick and sheeny, but it just feels soulless, plastic, and self-indulgent (although some of the faux-retro stuff -- think early Traffic -- on ""Point Shirley"" is kinda catchy). While I understand that this is a solo project and not a 97's record, I really miss Murry's voice on the backing vocals -- it would've provided a lot of the warmth that this collection is lacking.Bottom line, I think Rhett (or Elektra?) chose the wrong collaborator and, with only a few exceptions, the wrong songs. (I'm hoping this means he's saving the good stuff for the next 97's record.)"
2,Very boring for a toddler...,"I purchased this book through scholastics books thru my daughters preschool... she's 3... this book is very very basic & boring... nice pictures, but that's about it... more for 18 - 24 months!!!"
4,"Take Time For Good, Clean Fun!","This book centers on fun (planned and unplanned) with small, informal groups. This book is ideal for the young at heart, regardless of their age! With this book, you'll be able to enjoy a dozen or so friends and send them home at the end of the evening completely refreshed and talking about the fun they had at your gathering! At your next party, keep the TV and music off and enjoy each other with active games, quiet games, impromptu stunts, and just plain fun! Especially good for kids and young adults. The book is also loaded with practical advice for party leaders on how to create a relaxed atmosphere in which any party will thrive! Also ideal for church groups and gatherings. In summary, this book is about how to have good, clean fun with any small group."
5,A Real Hoot!,"Finally some interesting non-stereotype characters freshly portrayed by exciting new people. The actors, especially Jacob Newton, have a promising future in film."
3,Don't expect too much and you won't be...,"let down.Quite short (less than 80 minutes long), simple story about a closeted student (a cowboy) who fights with his own desires and feelings. Add some nudity, a couple of dirty jokes and hey presto you got ""Longhorns"".It's not a masterpiece and I think it wasn't intended to be. I am giving the 3-rd star for Derek Efrain Villanueva - not my type, but played his part very convincing.Rent it before you decide to buy a copy."
3,fun,"a fun and silly romp! I'm not crazy about it, but I enjoyed watching it and most likely will share with my friends."
2,again,wasn't to bad just where were the nude sex getting it on. It would be nice if there were more front nude and open nude sex really getting it on
4,Great tools at a great price,"This Dewalt combo pack is a great purchase for anyone wanting the best cordless tools. You get seven great tools for an unbelievable price when you consider that solo, most of these tools sell for between $190 - $290. The battery life on the dewalt units are great, I recently sheet- rocked an entire room on the same battery and it was still driving as strong as when I started the room. I also purchased a Jig saw so now I have 2 chargers and 4 batteries, nothing can slow me down now!"
5,All You Want To Know About The Development of Psychology,"The first time I read this book I was so delighted. I had borrowed it from the Public Library to help me with writing a paper. Never did I think I would find everything I needed to know about why and how psychology was developed,and the men that advanced science into the various systems/theories of psychology!I am so pleased that I can now own my own copy, through Amazon.com."
5,Sonique Musique,"This album is one of the rare kind that every song is good. I could listen to It Feels So Good a million times. There r 2 ballad type songs and one r and b flava song and the rest is dance. Sonique has a unique voice and she is highly listenable, it feels so good 2 hear her sang."
1,Disappointing,"There was nothing on here for me. Sonique's voice is stellar, no doubt...but I did not like any of the songs (and I love Dance!)"
4,One of the best CDs to workout to,"Simply, if you workout on an exercise machine and need motivation and a fast beat... this is the one! There are a few slow tracks, skip over them and go back to those tracks for your cool-down and stretch. Sonique has an amazing voice. I can't wait for future CDs."
4,Great Video ROCKY!,The Rock layin the smackdown. It shows his greatest matches like the ladder match from SS. It also starts from the time he was in the Nation. All the way to Backlash the difference between the Rock and Austin's video. Was Austin's video showed more footage of his matches. Rock's didn't but it was a great video. Very great athlete he is the most electrifying man in Sports entertainment if ya smellllalalalala what the Rock is cooking Jabroni's. Awesome highlights and feuds especially with Mankind. You can tell he really hates Austin!
2,know Your Role Video,"This video was very disappointing. Let me put it this way. Have you seen the PPVs with the Rock/Nation vs. DX. Have you seen him fight Austin way back when he first started becoming the Rock? Did you see him fight Mankind for the title during those 6 months where the two had about a billion title changes between them? Have you seen RAW from the beginning of the Nation Feud to all the way when this video was made? Then you basically saw the whole video. If you expect to see extras, that's not happening in this video. Unless you want to relive The Rock's ppv matches with HHH and Mankind in the form of about 5-7 minute reviews, then you should get this. If you're looking for extras, don't bother."
4,Well made toy,"We have certainly gotten our money's worth out of this toy! We purchased it for my son for Christmas in 2008. As of Christmas 2010, it is still being used and is still running just fine. My kids have used it inside on the hardwood floors and the carpet, and outside on the driveway. It runs well in all of these places. It has been through very small puddles, but we haven't really run it through deep puddles, so I can't speak to its waterproofness. Battery life seems long compared to other similar toys."
5,"Outrageous, fun, sexy, comedy!","About Adam is clever, hip and has an amazing cast. Especially the neurotic Frances O'Connor, and the absolutely devilish Stuart Townsend as the irresistable cad Adam. This movie will make you laugh till it hurts. It's absolutly outrageous!Told in the first person perspectives of 3 sisters and their brother all of which form strong ties with the camelian like character of Adam.Adam seems the perfect lover, husband, friend, son in law or anything else he is requested to be. It's a fasinating look at how one man can involve himself so completely with one family in what seem to be a matter of weeks.You should hate Adam, and especially if your a woman, fear a man like Adam, but you just wish that he could come and knock on your door and give you all your hearts desires.This film is a funny guily pleasure that you will be glad to slip in to your DVD player over and over again."
3,they've made better albums...,"alright, so here are my thoughts on this cd -b/c i've loved pmb ever since i heard them way back in 1996, i actually went to the cd release party for ""shine"" here in cville and got the cd free with my admission. the show was great, but i'm really glad i didn't have to pay for the cd. they're an amazing band live - they've got so much energy on stage. b/c they're my boys, i hate to say it...but this cd is lacking. it's enjoyable enough and makes me wanna dance around, but most of the songs ends up verging on generic (lyrically and/or musically). if you want to hear quality pat mcgee, get ""revel"" or ""from the wood""."
3,Really disappointing to a Pat McGee Band fan,"I used to see these guys when they were playing small venues in Richmond. I love this band. Which is why Im giving this 3 stars as opposed to 2. This CD is very sterile for them. Over production has taken away a key element of this band. I cant really put my finger on it, but it almost seems like they were appathetic when they recorded this. I agree with the original review of this CD, with the talents they have, they could have done better. If you really want to give this band a listen, puchase something live like ""General Addmission"". Its much better."
3,Let Down,"I just bought this album on the advice of a few people. I had not heard anything else from the Pat McGee Band before, but I must say this album is kind of blah. It sounds like a cross between DMB and the Samples, but not sure where it wants to go. All the songs sound the same, there's nothing new here. Maybe big fans of this band may like it, but I would have liked to hear some more of these guys first."
5,WOW,The 1812 Festival Overture With Chorus; The Sleeping Beauty; The Voyevoda Symphonic Ballad; and The Moscow Coronation Cantata With The Dallas Symphony Orchestra And The Dallas Symphony Chorus and Andrew Litton all on one CD -- WOW! What more can I say!
3,"""This is not Sherwood Forest. It Is London. And You Are Not Robin Hood You are Prudence Pennhallow...""","But for Prudence, the idea of lifting valuables from fine ladies and gentlemen and turning them into money for the poor seemed an excellent one. And the extravagant affairs of the London Season proved to be the perfect cover for a bit of theivery. Perfect, that is, until Lor Brimley appeared on the scene. Fresh from his country estate and weary of milk-and-water misses, the dashing earl was quite taken with the mysterious Miss Pennhallow. Indeed, her elaborate schemes and feminine ploys kept him vastly entertained. Yet Brimley would not have been quite so amused had he known the danger his ladylove had fallen into. For another world-be suitor was moving in- with greed in his heart and blackmail on his mind..."
2,"Boring, artists beware!","I don't know anything about law, but I had to take an Art and the Law course to graduate. This class was very boring and so was the book. If you don't have to read it, DON'T. If you like law, then maybe you'll appreciate it, but for an artist, don't bother! The plus was that it explained the law, but also explained historical cases where the law applied. Though, it did not show any photos of artwork to be able to better understand the cases--particularly the copyright cases where it would be important to compare. For a ""nutshell"", it could be worse.For an artist, I would recommend ""Legal Guide for the Visual Artist"". It provides examples of the forms that you might have to fill out. It also goes into newer problems within the artistic field, like Digital imagery."
5,My favorite book to date.,"I love this book! Sometimes I am in the mood for a cheap taudry romance novel but I am always in the mood for a fun love affair! Sure there is some sex in it but overall it is a lighthearted comedy love story. I had the book but misplaced it years ago and finally tracked down the name of the book. I just now placed an order to buy a used one from here. I don't care what condition it's in as long as the pages are there and I can read it...over and over again. Before it got lost (most likely in all the moves I have had over the years), I couldn't put it down!"
1,Not good,"This book was filled with normal boring events. I didn't buy the book to go through the process of buying cloths, grocery shopping, eating cookies or pizzas...The romance was sooooo lame... The real life romance seems more exciting than what I read in this book..I had read the author's other romance books as well. They were as boring as this one. I don't why I thought this would be different. My mistake and will not happen again."
1,Awful smell...don't buy!,"I really wanted to love these based on all of the wonderful reviews, but I didn't I also thought Boon stated this problem was fixed, but it's not. The smell was awful and I knew these would make it to my son's mouth and I didn't know what kind of chemicals could be on there. Oh well, maybe someday they will just sell the foam pieces alone..then I'll get them!Since you have to give a star, I'd say that star is for Amazon's customer service and really easy return policy. This is the first thing I've ever returned, so I didn't know what to expect and it was more than pleasant!"
4,anti-climatic,These are great bath toys that don't get moldy and dry out easily and quickly. My daughter didn't find them super exciting though she does like that they stick to the shower wall.
5,My Niece Loves It!,"I ordered this as a gift for my 14-month-old niece, and she adores it! At first, she was fascinated by all the great shapes. Then, when she got them in the tub and realized they stick to her and the walls, she was thrilled--giggles and smiles all the way. Thanks for a great product!"

2,Get what you pay for,"Let me first say that the delivery was excellent. I got the item earlier than expected. I don't blame the seller at all. However, the problem is that I got what I paid for. The balls are plastic so the metal post easily stripped the grooves where it screws into the ball. There was no way to tighten it. I lost the ball and the ring the 2nd day I was wearing it. However, the one day I had the ring, I loved it. It was pretty that first day."
3,Not much bossa.............,"This is a wide variety of smooth Latin jazz, but very little bossa nova, as only track 6 was real bossa nova. These tunes are modern, contemporary mild jazz arrangements, but not what a bossa nova collector is looking for."
