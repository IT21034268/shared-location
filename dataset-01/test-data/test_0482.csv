5,good,"este es un buen articulo , llego en el tiempo prometido y en buen estado, fue una buena compra..g]racias"
1,Stylish but not useful,"I chose this shawl because I hate the patterns that others tend to have. However, people buy those for a reason and that reason is that they are actually useful. The coverage on this shawl is poor. Additionally, there is no wiring around the neck that allows you to peek down and see your baby. My baby is not the best breastfeeder ever and especially early on he needed a lot of guidance from me. It is very difficult to keep yourself covered and see your baby at the same time with this wrap. I'd recommend you get one of the more traditional shawls instead (Bebe au Lait, Hooters Hiders, etc.)"
3,It Looks Nice...Thats About It...,"This nursing shawl is every pretty and blends in, not even looking like a nursing cover. However, it's very big and the sides are shorter than the front and back. It's going to take a couple of practices at home to get this nursing shawl in the right position where people won't see underneath, your baby can breathe, you can see him, and be able to hold your breast (if you need to). This shawl's claim to fame is that you can see your baby. NOT TRUE! Maybe I need to practice more, but it is very hard to see your baby if you have to use two hands. I did use it to cover my baby in the car seat. When we had to go to the doctor and take off all of his clothes, we did use it as a quick blanket so he wouldn't be kept cold. It feels very nice on the outside, inside is fine. And it is very thin, I wouldn't use it in the winter. It is very stylish."
4,"A great low-priced recording ""studio""","I just have to chime in and say my brother and I have been using this product for years now and it is great. To the two complaints below: For the one who hears noise when pushing rec, I am guessing you have the ext mic on (or would it be internal? At any rate, the built-in mic). To the one whose card doesn't work ..... Well, I don't know honestly. I've never had that problem and have never had to update it online. I didn't even know you could.At any rate, compared to the insane prices of most of this type of equipment, this is a great deal. It may not be quite ""professional"" quality but it's really not bad at all. A great product that I would recommend."
1,Junk,"Avoid at all cost. Hit record and all your hear is noise - even with nothing (mic, instrument) plugged in you get this horrible noise on the track you are recording too. Piece of junk."
3,Great for College course material,"I bought this book, hoping to gain more insight about Native American spiritual traditions. Though it is filled with a lot of information, it was too much ""work"" to read and understand the author's points. As my title suggests, it is better used for a philosophy or anthropology course."
3,Nearly the same as the onboard tool!,This accessory is the EXACT same thing as the onboard upholstery brush except this one is 50% larger (about 3 inches longer) and the inside hole is bigger so more debris can get through. This is good for getting pet hair off the couches and mattess faster than with the small onboard tool but that's about it. No fancy bells or whistles. No rotating beater bar inside or anything. Glad I didn't pay full price for it!
2,Not Right For Me,"Unfortunately, this CD was not the right choice for me. I wish there was a way to preview it online first and I would have seen that the music is too fast and not to my liking. She shouold have spent a little time instructing the steps in slow motion first and then speed it up."
5,Great DVD!,"I have no experience with hip hop, but I was able to learn the steps in this workout fairly easily. The music is not something I recognize, but goes well with the steps. It was a pleasant surprise."
4,Great Workout.,"This CD has 5 - 10 minute workouts to choose from. All of them are fun, what I would call low impact, and you can tell you are working muscles! I am 40+ and love the hip-hop theme. I have been doing 2 workouts back to back for 3 weeks and I am seeing results. I must say that the moves are sasy to do when she is showing them to you, but I know I look ridiculas when she brings the moves up to speed. After doing them a few times however it gets better, and my family has quit laughing at me. Haven't tried my moves out in a club yet but my daughter-in law says I'm almost ready!"
4,glad I bought this,"I'm a 50-something women with a dance background (jazz, ballroom mostly). I've enjoyed this video workout. As a working mom, a 10-minute workout is feasible. In fact, I have so much fun with it that I usually let it play for an additional 5-10 minutes."
5,Key to the heart,"While this product is totally useless as a functional key, it is a superior piece in terms of fashion. Made of hard metal (cast iron?) it will not disappoint anyone who wants to add a durable piece of mystique to their person. The painting on the key is slightly lower quality than I expected, but it is a great product for its price."
2,Nice key,"Davy Jones key is nice cause it's kinda metal I think. Not that plastic crap where if you bend it, it snaps, but it's a nice key, especially if you're a fan of pirates of the caribbean!"
3,I found The Natural House more useful,"While a good book, I found The Natural House more useful for my specific needs. To be honest, we decided not to go with solar power due to the cost (and lack of help with the price where we live, in TN) and due to the topography of our lot. The Natural House provided a great resource for other avenues of eco-friendly options for our new house, including various options for heating and cooling. If you are not sure how you want to heat your house yet and you are looking for more general information, I would recommend getting that book instead."
3,"Really Good, But.....","This is a book with a good deal of information on solar homes. But the author repeats himself over and over. The book could have been writen in about 70 pages instead of 270 pages. Also the author does not give you all the necessary information that he could. Instead he refers you to different websites throughout the book. Before I read this book I had already done a lot of research on solar houses on the internet, though this does take more time the information was free and covered at least 80% of what is in this book. With a little more research I probably could have found the rest. The book is still a good read though."
3,I guess the end negated the beginning,"I got this book because I was looking for an inspirational story, despite the title. I was expecting a guy who did great things, then flamed out like Hendrix, but I read about a guy who descended into madness. Left me wanting more."
5,I WAS at the SHOW!,"I not only have the CD; but I was at the concert this CD was recorded at. And I haveta tellya, these guys played their hearts out! Crack the Sky, unlike most bands in their position (playing 1 or 2 gigs a year to the ""true believers""), Crack the Sky has only gotten better over the years; especially with the move back to twin lead guitars.If you like Crack The Sky, you should own this CD. If you've never heard Crack the Sky, this would actually be a good place to start, because this is their best music played at their best."
3,"Good, only one problem...","not bad, but the RF remote function does not work! I can't set one foot outside of the room my receiver is in and use the remote. The RF antenna included is supposed to allow you to operate the receiver from basically anywhere in the house. I have found postings by professional DSS installers that say they have not been able to get the RF function to work. Called support, and they say you have to go through and try changing the RF code until you get one to work, but this is only supposed to be changed IF it conflicts with another RF remote! And there are 256 possible codes! I am not impressed with this option on this particular receiver!"
5,Not Free SF Reader,"This is an omnibus containing Taltos and PhoenixA novel in three parts, or streams. Vlad is involved in some heavy duty witchcraft, is looking back at his earlier life in some greater detail than in earlier books, and is also showing us how he met Morrolan.As far as the latter goes, a complicated sorcerous plot leads Vlad and Morrolan on a decidedly dangerous mission to Deathsgate Falls and the Paths of the Dead.A couple of the important magical artificats appear : Spellbreaker, for Vlad, and Aliera's Great Weapon.4.5 out of 5Vlad gets himself into quite a lot of poo owing to his desire to keep his estranged wife Cawti from being executed as a revolutionary.Before that, though, he makes a deal with his patron goddess of witchcraft, and the two end up being related via the kingdom of Greenaere, some 'work' and possible war.Vlad ends up on the lam from the Jhereg because he testifies about their goings on to the Empress.4 out of 5"
3,Make up in Love,"I enjoy Doug's ""country"" voice so much. The songs are not what I expected. ""Make up in Love"" and ""Take a Letter"" are familiar and easy listening. Doug is the storyteller within his music. I may have to ""listen"" a few more times to fully enjoy the songs without being too analytical. ""Room Without a View"" has great potential."
4,We'll make up in love,"I feel that this song expresses the fundamentals of a lasting relationship. Everything isn't going to be perfect, so we make it up in love!"
1,Boring - What a shame of how to remember one's Mother.,"Trying to get through this book is like watching paint dry. It's written so poorly. Every stinking detail about Marlene's life. Could've been written better. I don't care how many times her breasts were taped up or how many times she wet her pants when she laughed. I'm sure there were more important things that happened. The way this story about her life is written and all her lovers and how she flaunts them in her husband's face, makes Britany Spears and Lindsay Lohan look like saints. Even Paris Hilton is looking more saintly after reading this book! What a shame of how to remember one's Mother."
5,Beastly! Ghastly! GREAT!,"Beastly Boys and Ghastly Girls was one of my FAVORITE books when I was a kid. Unfortunately, my First Edition copy went missing, probably in a flood, years ago. I finally found a good library copy that didn't cost me an arm and two legs, so I could share the naughty fun with my own kids. This is not highbrow stuff; however, lest you be tempted to raise a disapproving eyebrow, note that you will find poems by A.A. Milne, Shel Silverstein, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow - and if you want to encourage a child to love poetry, this is the book that will do it. Read more at http://jahangiri.us/news/2009/08/16/beastly-ghastly/."
1,Don't waste your time,"Buy an actual book on self defense instead, this is just useless. Any man who will lie to your face and tell you that having or carrying a defensive handgun is either a poltroon or the type of wealthy individual who lives behind a group of men who carry guns for him. The endorsements from anti-self defense politicians says it all. Every piece of advice in this book can and will be overcome by a determined criminal, and then you're left with nothing to defend yourself with, just a couple broken locks. Stick to what works ladies and gentlemen, the armed man or woman is the prepared man or woman.I just wish I could rate this lower. Please read the works of Colonel Jeff Cooper instead."
2,Plot a little complicated,After reading this novel. I have found there are not enough words per page to draw me into the wild world of spot!!! I am not feeling the through action line was enough to keep me 'enthralled' until the end( I kept stepping away from the book for breaks). I have enough problems finding my own possesions in my bedroom and am slightly upset that i now have lost some more!All in all i believe this dog has way too many emotions and opinions for a dog as mine blatently does not talk...especially to me!!!As long as you are under 30 you may appreciate this book - or close to senile!!! Have fun.
4,Readable/Undersrandable!,"We are using this book in a class at OLLI, the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at the U. of Arizona.It is meant for lay students, and is superb in every way."
5,I KNOW WHERE YOU CAN BUY THIS FILM!,Go to www.blackstar.com and 'Fall' is for sale there. I know because I bought it!
1,WAY TOO SAPPY with FATTTEST SUPERMODEL EVER!,"Really wanted to see this Movie.... Sorely DISAPPOINTED. Quite BORING. Really just an EXTENDED MUSIC VIDEO. The only humorous part was the CASTING: THIS IS THE FATTEST SUPERMODEL YOU WILL EVER SEE ON DVD(and NOT VERY ATTRACTIVE except for those BLOATED LIPS!) Sorry Schaffer, your standards must be quite lower than mine. I've dated scores of women that are far more attractive."
5,This Movie Should Have Been On AFI Top 100 List,I don't think this movie made it to general release at your local movie theatres. The movie offers humor and drama with a sexual undertone. Eric Schaeffer and Amanda De Cadenet made this movie irresistible to watch and the ending sequence is excellent and well crafted. I thought Good Will Hunting was good until I saw Fall. You don't know what you are missing until you see this one. END
5,Great baby gift!,"This is a great baby gift! 15 piece set at a good price. I gave this to a friend and she loved it.AlAlexander Inn, Palm Springs, CA"
1,Nice light but does not last long,"I have six of these lamps as kitchen undercounter accent lamps and they are not used often, shortly after five years of limited use, my first lamp failed - then my second one failed. Given the cost of the fixture, I am now considering removing all fixtures and replacing them with a different manf product so I do not have to repeat replacement in another five years.These are nice lamps, however if you are considering to use them as a lamp that will see a lot of use - I would consider a different product - they are not long lasting.Also, the bulbs are pricy but the bulb seems to last longer then the fixture as I have not replaced any bulbs after five years - just 1/3 of my fixtures."
1,Book offers mediocre selection of resumes,"This book has a nice cover and title, but the resumes are pretty bland and unimaginative."
3,Walton Symphony,"I'm not as pleased with Walton's symphonies as many. I'm pretty new tosymphony music, so its probably me. I play the piano and a horn as a kid wheni played in school bands and orchestras etc. And now I'm older and study musictheory etc --still don't get it all that well. But the author of my music theorybook loves this guy Walton so I thought I'd get some of his music. But its notso great to me/maybe I'll grow into it."
2,Pretty weak effort - everybody seems to be on Valium!,"Dave Carradine and his Dave Leisure(JoeIsuzu) look alike partner investigatecrimes of dastardly Griffin O'Neal'sstreet gang of punks. Nancy Quan playshis long suffering liberal social worker(??) girlfriend (??) wife, we're neversure. Writer-Director-Co-Producer/NobodyNorbert Meisel's hamfisted directionand the cheap (and dark!) productionstandards hurt what could be a decentB Indy film. Since Carradine did sixother projects this year, he can beforgiven for not being his sharpesthere. Losses an eye in Deer Hunterripoff scene and punk before he pullsthe triger EVEN SAYS IT'S A RIPOFF ofthe Deerhunter! Patrick Culliton, witha mustache appears at the beginning(He played opposite Dave in FutureForce and Future Zone ) gets bumped offso early in film I had to watch it twiceto realize he was in here, as it said soin closing credits. Meisel never workedin Hollyweird again and one or two looksof this film and you will know why!"
1,A FOOLS LED DOWN THE PATH,"IF THEY HAD ANY GUTS THEY WOULD REPORT ON BUILDING 7 THAT COLAPSED FOR NO REASON OR HOW A GIANT PLANE FIT INTO A 20 FOOT HOLE AT THE PENTAGON, HOW AMERICA IS BEING DESTROYED, AND HOW THE FOOLS JUST GO ALONG DOWN THE PATH W/O A THOUGHT TOWARD TRUTH. wE LOST AMERICA-GOD FORGIVE THE BRAVE WHO CARE."
5,Transfer switch review.,I feel that this switch will perform very well if needed in a power outage.It is a lot better than what is available in stores here!
3,You will need expensive breakers,This is a great unit but if your looking for 20 and 15 amp breakers you are going to have to buy them. It cost me 100 bucks in breakers to make this thing usable. PLUS the plastic wire tubing they give you is junk. You have to buy that as well.
1,Five tries and I am out,"I am an experienced home baker with a well-equipped kitchen. I have tried five different recipes from this book--and they are just not that good. Road trip cookies--I have had better, brown sugar chocolate chip bars--not as good as you would think; Mrs. D's chocolate chip cookies--meh, maple walnut chocolate praline--hope you have good dental insurance. The dogwood bark was ok--but it is just melted chocolate over nuts.As other reviewers have commented, there are a lot of errors. I have had to troubleshoot every recipe. Perhaps the recipes were not tested?I am putting this cookbook in my give away pile so that I am not tempted by the lovely photos to attempt any more of these recipes."
5,Production of Viagra discontinued,That's a headline you're likely to see in the future if everyone would buy (and use) Marcel Desaulniers latest book. Mouthwatering photographs along with the clearest directions I've ever come across plus CHOCOLATE!!!!! and tons of it. What better aphrodisiac can a person need?????
1,doesnt work with Vista 64-bit,"If you are expecting to install this on a Vista 64-bit PC, the bluetooth dongle will not work, and the drivers are not yet available"
3,"Bad flick, but dig the Din and Tonics!","This made for TV movie is not going to change many lives or make many lists as one of the best pictures ever made. It is a pretty prosaic story about a Radcliffe freshman's affair with her English professor's husband. The film is noteworthy in part because it features a young Courtney Cox before she hit the big time on Friends. More important, however, is the fact that the film is the first on-screen appearance of the Harvard Din and Tonics, possibly the best collegiate acapella singing group in the nation. Connoisseurs of the acapella scene should check out this snapshot of the early Dins......."
4,"A near classic, runs flawlessly in Leopard","This game is old enough for all to know pretty much what there is to know about it. It's great. I played it originally a few years ago when it was still new to the Mac platform. Thought I'd try it again on the latest Macbook Pro, and it runs without error. If there's any little thing wrong, it's that I can't seem to tweak the settings to take full advantage of the good graphics card in the machine, but it's probably just that compared to Quake 4 (or any of the latest games) RTCW's graphics lack detail and thus look dated. A minor point. If you've never played it, dive in knowing that the latest Mac OS will not give the game hiccups. If you've played it before, you know there's a high degree of re-playability built into the game. Go forth and knock yourselves out!"
5,"Heaven, Simply Heaven!!!!!","1000 words is not enough to explain my love for Nanci and her ever surprising vocal performances. I also like the songs she sings because they are simplistic, honest, and so touching. Darius Rucker also does a great job on Five and Dime. This is her best...and my favorite CD for 1999. Good job Nanci....please please keep up the good work!!"
3,Falling into the trap of over arranging,Nanci Griffith has missed the mark with this one. The strength of her writing and beautiful sincerity of her delivery are often lost in these new arrangements. More is not better.
5,Very informative,I received this book for Christmas and was very impressed. It has so much information and great pictures. I am a self taught beginning water color painter. Very well written book that I could understand. I just hope she comes out with more.
4,"A bargain, if you trust customer applied ECO's","I picked up 4 pairs of these on Amazon, and have applied the CA and Nylon tape fix to the first pair (took about 10 minutes to do, let it cure overnight). Headphones look ok, with just the right amount of Geekhood proudly announced afterwards (reminiscent of the last generation of Geeks with the tape on the glasses). Sound is very good (better than most earbuds), they establish link quite quickly with the dedicated Logitech transiever, and range is outstanding. My only beef is how long I have to hold down the power switch to turn them on, and so far I have not successfully established a connections with my Treo 650. 1 star held back because of need of customer applied ECO, and they are only partially functional with the Nano (can't use the advance track feature of the headphones)."
4,Logitech Wireless Headphones,This product actually works well and is very convenient for exercising and other situations where you dont't want the headphones attached to the player. They are comfortable and the sound quality is good--as good as or better than what comes with the iPod.
1,Logitech wireless were useless,"I could not get these headphones to work with my iPod. These phones hadanother input that made it impossible to connect to my ipod. SomeiPods apparently have a remote control input, and these phones were madefor that. Most iPods do not have this input, including mine. I sent themback, and bought another brand at Best Buy. They work, but do draw a lotmore power than regular earphones. My reccomenadtion is, to stick withplug-in type phones, until the manufactues get it right."
3,"Good sound, poor construction","The wireless performance of these headphones is flawless and the sound quality is quite good. However, they are designed for a specific head size, and any one outside of that range should avoid this model. The head band is made of an inflexible plastic that will eventually crack under pressure. They are also a tad on the bulky side and comments about Princess Leia are not uncommon. Logitech makes a more durable headphone, model F-04618, that will last longer and is less obtrusive. The downside is you lose track control ability since the newer model is not a dedicated ipod headphone."
1,LOGITECH MADE A MISTAKE,"HEY GUYS` DOES ANY ONE KNOW IT THERE IS AN IMPROVED VERSION OF THESE HEADPHONES? BETTER HEAD BAND) OR ANY OTHER WIRELESS BRAND FOR IPOD? EMAIL ME TO PEPELILY@HOTMAIL.COM LOGITECH WAS REALLY GOOD UNTILL THEY MADE THESE SUCKERS,, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, THEY WILL CRACK, AND I DID TRY SEVERAL OF THE REALLY AND EXPENSIVE STRONG GLUES, AND.........WASTE OF MONEY MY FRIEND, THEY DID NOT WORK, HAVE A NICE DAY"
2,very cheap plastic,"Within a week of using these, the plastic band going around the back started to crack. Now I've had them for maybe 3 weeks and today I have to wrap the back in tape or it would have snapped in two. I haven't been abusing the headphones, I'm just a big guy with a larger than average head. It also sometimes takes a while for the headset and reciever to link up. And lastly, they're terrible if you're moving a lot in relation to the base. I was cutting my grass, staying well within the 30 foot range, but my signal kept cutting out. I put the iPod in my pocket and it was fine after that. But if I have the iPod in my pocket, why do I need wireless headphones?They're okay now that I have them, but wouldn't recommend them to anyone if any of the above problems might apply to them."
1,Deceiving,There is no mention on the product about which ipods this is compatable.We have multiple levels of ipods at home.The adapter only fits certain generations of ipods. So it was useless on our current video ipod or nano.It did fit on our 2nd generaton ipod that is non-functional. I think it is horrible that there was not a clear mention of compatability. So now I have to return it.
2,were these things ever tested?,"I got my set of these headphones yesterday, and charged them overnight. Today I came into work, plugged the transponder-like part into my shiny new v5.5 30GB video iPod albeit crooked because the thing isn't compatible, and was ready to go! Not so fast. It took a minute or so to get the headphones to ""talk"" to the main unit. OK.I got music! I can only control the volume with headset, however. The pause/play button in the middle and the fw/rw buttons just result in a ""beep"" noise and no action. This sucks. I'm not sure if this is because the other metal portion of the transponder part doesn't fit in to my new iPod, or what.So far they haven't cracked but they are tight. I give them a week.Don't waste your money and read the fine print, I guess."
2,Wireless headphones,"It is a great idea, with a few qualifiers.I have found that the forward and reverse buttons don't function for my video ipod or for my niece's nano (maybe it would for a non-apple mp3 player?). I have to pair the device to the Ipod every time I turn it on. The bluetooth transponder will drain the ipod's battery even though it has it's own battery. Sound quality is decent."
1,They break !?!,"My first pair broke within a week. Just normal wear and tear, taking them off my head. No snowboarding, no car wrecks, no toddlers. They just snap under their own weight. Then the crack expanded and must have pulled one of the wires loose because they stopped charging. Logitech, to their credit, sent me a replacement quickly. Then those broke too."
3,they broke,"they broke. while snow boarding. before that, they were fantastic- both on the mountain and in the gym. Good range, easy to learn the controls on the ear piece. Battery life really did live up to the 8 hours. but the behind the head band broke in less than rough conditions."
1,Argh! Band breaks way too easily.,"This review is just more of the same. I loved the product, used it gently but the band still broke. Just not worth the price with the cheap construction and lack of support from Logitech. Had a great idea, but didn't deliver is quality."
5,"Latex/natural rubber free tape for those with allergies. Works great, transparent.","Latex free/Natural rubber free-great for those with latex allergies. Works great, even wet. Very strong."
3,Works but not really transparent,"Got this to use, but when I tested it, it's not really transparent, I guess you can see through part of it, but it's not like you can see through it, really, because the threads are not transparent."
3,Disappointing,"Clearly, this woman has talent to spare. And I will even grant her her due as a songwriter. But her songs are so personal that the whole effort winds up boring me to tears. While there's nothing particularly bad about writing personal songs, I think most people want to be able to relate to them on some level -- or at least empathize. These songs are even too personal for that. Too bad, because she is an otherwise very talented artist. Maybe her next album will be better."
5,works great!,"No problems! Highly recommended.It did take a few re-starts of the main unit to get it ""synced.Been trouble free ever since."
2,temp. sensor,"I thought it would replace the one I had, and that it would work with Model RMR112A, but it didn't. I have tried to contact Oregon but can't get thought to the company. The sensor is not being used,"
2,Sorry but horrible performance,"Sir Marriner is in general one of my favorite conductors, but this performance is bad. I am not an expert and cannot specifically explain in what manner this recording is bad, but you would soon realize something is wrong when you would listen to this CD. Perhaps tempi are unstable. Sound quality is mediocre, as is often with London Cds."
3,Hammer review,"The fatmax xtreme Antivibe hammer is awesome, however the model that came in the mail is slightly different than the picture, I was disappointed about that, but I love the hammer."
3,"Ok, but not my favorite CD","I enjoy a lot of songs from this album, especially ""Lost in this Moment"", ""Please Man"", and ""Loud."" I am not in love with all of the songs like I have been with past albums where every song was a fave. I also don't like the setup of the album with the slow songs all in the first 5 or 6 songs and the last 6 or so songs are all fast. I find myself skipping past the slow songs to get to the fast ones. I would prefer a more traditional setup with a good mix of slow and fast throughout."
2,Lousy Album,A very weak album to say the least. It's been all downhill for these guys since Horse Of A Different Color. I had high hopes for this album but there's nothing on it to hang your hat on. Mostly slow songs and even the few uptempo numbers aren't very good.
3,Not As Good As Previous Records by Artist,This cd was Ok but not as good as Big & Riches previous 2 cd's. The hard driving country they are known for was minimal on this record and that really disappointed me. I am used to loving every sone on their cd' san dI only liked about 3 on this cd. They can do much better.
2,These country boys don't rock and roll,"Big disappointment. This album is pure country- gone are the edgy, rock-tinged, hell-raisin' songs of their first 2 albums that made them unique, and made me a fan. The above quote is from one of their songs (""Country boys don't rock and roll, you know, the record man told me so""), lamenting the industry's original rejection of their style. Looks as if they're toeing the line now, to our detriment. I won't be buying any more of their albums."
3,NOT waterproof,"The description says ""water repellant"", which is partially true. A gentle rain falling on the outside of the bag, or dew settling on the bag overnight will not get inside it, because the material it's made from is heavy vinyl.However, it has a zipper. It isn't a waterproof zipper. Any water coming under the 1"" flap that covers the zipper will get all your stuff wet. If it gets wet enough for water to start running off the bag, there's a good chance the stream of water will find the zipper - and it's game over.I wouldn't use this duffel on the back of a motorcycle, strapped to the top of a car, in the bed of a truck or in a boat that might see splashing water. In fact, I'm not sure what it would be good for. A regular duffel bag will shed water for a few minutes, but your stuff will eventually get wet. This will shed water for a as long as you can keep the zipper dry. Not sure of the point.For casual use in light rain, it would be fine.Returned."
4,texsport hydra duffle II,"i like this bag, it packs a lot of stuff and sheds water pretty good.it is not a ""dry bag"" but a really good water repellant bag.great for canoe trips on calm water or up to maybe class II waters.i would buy this bag any day of the week"
2,not impressed,"my last pair of guy cottens lasted 10 years without a problem, these lasted 4 months and got a hole in the seat already. they're not even coated inside, it's just straight canvas that absorbs fish offal. they are comfortable though.i recommend doing yourself a favor and paying the extra $30 for a pair of guy cottens, totally worth it."
5,Perfect solution,I had been looking for a gift for a son who is a fishing nut. These worked out great to allow him to persue his passion--all year around!
2,"Probably a fine lens, but didn't work well with APS-C camera","I now have bought two lenses that were not designed for the smaller digital camera sensor, and both consistently fail to autofocus, the Sigma 28mm and the Canon 50mm f1.8 II, both relatively inexpensive lenses, and both designed for film cameras I believe. I was able to get both to focus most of the time by using my ""live view"" focusing, but it is slow and you can't use the viewfinder. I just couldn't justify keeping this large, heavy, no doubt very high quality lens if it was going to be that difficult to use.The kit lens that came with my Canon XSi focuses much more reliably, maybe because that lens is designed for small sensor cameras."
3,not as good as his first album!!,I like this CD even dough it is not as good as I thought it would be but Im a big O.D.B fan so i support all his projects. He still keept his dirty style that he is famouse for and this makes this a good cd.
2,ODB is back again.,"First, I am not one of those people that go around giving rap cd's 2 stars because I don't like rap. Wu Tang is one of my favorite rap groups out there and odb is brilliant in every wu tang song I've heard. I just don't think odb is ready or capable of putting out a solo album.You will not like this album if you don't enjoy hearing odb screaming out a bunch of nonsense. There is no doubt that odb is extremely unique in his own sense, but he shows no talent in this album. ""Got your money"" is a good song that earned the 2 stars.Over all, if you are a fan of odb, I suggest you buy a wu tang clan cd."
2,"""BIG BABY.........You DO need to wait""","Well first of all....I'm not a Wu-Tang fan, but I did buy Inspectah Deck, and Raekwon, and this garbage put out by Ol Dirty is ridiculous. I think all those times of him going to jail finally got to him.In jail, they might have made a punk out of him,and this album is a direct reflection of it. Only like 3 tracks are hardly worth listening to, and that is not good. 1/2 of the time he tries to show off his vocal skills, and that he can sing but he cant. I cant beleive RZA would even allow something like this out on the streets. The best song is the one produced by IRV GOTTI, and the 2nd one is the intro w/Chris Rock. And last but not least Baby I Got Cha Money. Overall, this album is not worth the money you are gonna spend on it so do yourself a favor and by something else.-One Love ""HDG"" NLS '01"
3,"An above-average album, but not a Wu-Tang album","I'll tell you the problem with these new Wu-Tang albums-they're not Wu-Tang albums!!! The formula for a Wu-Tang album is the artist + the Rza, as sole producer, + and several guest appearances from the clan = A pure masterpiece. I miss the real Wu-Tang albums, but if you like this one, then enjoy. My fellow Wu-Tang fans and I will await the ""hopeful"" return of the Rza to do all of the production, then everyone will understand how good hip-hop was, and can really be!!!"
4,"Dirty, Dirty, Dirty","Ol' Dirty Bastard is insane.Nigga Please is the most original, crazy, completely out there album in rap music.ODB makes previous 'crazy-rap' artists sound tame in comparison.ODB's 1st cousin The RZA, once said 'There's only one ODB, the world couldn't handle anymore'. No kidding! This album has great beats mixed with singing, rapping, and a variety of ridiculous sounds and sqeeks coming out of nowhere.This album is almost too weird to be offensive.Although sad, Ol' Dirty's death recently shouldnt've come as a big surprise to anyone. Givin his reckless, drug-addled lifestyle for many years it's a wonder he made as far as 2005!Nigga Please is the blueprint album for everything ODB!The fact that ANY song on this album got airplay, especially a theme song for Californian pimps (Got You Money), is a testament to what an obvious force and presence the artist was.Nothing out there like it, never will be. Sure to become a classic in later years."
2,Either you like it or You Don't,"I almost didn't finish this book as I found it so depressing, but after reading all the reviews, I did finish it. I now wish I hadn't finished it. Maybe, I read to be uplifted and that's why I didn't like this book. There's enough tradgedy in the world without bringing it into your home.The book was fairly well written, so I did give it two stars. That's the best I could do."
4,Very Touching,This was a really good book. I was very touched by this little girl's tale. It is tragic. This is a quick read. I read it every night while taking a bath and got through it in a week.
5,A Haunting and Inspirational Novel,"Roseflower Creek grabs at a raw nerve of human experience and brings a new perspective to abuse, poverty, alcoholism and above all, forgiveness. Told in the most wholesome and honest of voices; that of a 10-year-old child.Lori Jean's curious and optimistic narrative breathes life into her world of rural Georgia in the 1950's. This novel dives into subjects and situations many people refuse to acknowledge. This book will break your heart then leave you believing in the power of forgiveness and the strength of the human spirit.Lori Jean will stay with you long after the last word has been read."
5,Excellent alternative to photo paper.,Sturdy and shiny on both sides. Prints beautifully. And a great value compared to single-side photo paper. I printed a calendar on this paper with a photo in the middle of the other graphics. The photo just popped off the page. It looked like a photograph was glued to the surface!
1,Intuitiveness at 100% opaque,"I just can't learn this application. Coming from a Powerpoint world, this seems to be just the most obtuse application I've ever come across. Even simple things like making a layer a solid color (any color!) seems to require special skills. The help function is entirely useless. I just don't refer to it anymore. This application seems to assume you already know how to use it. Tremendously high learning curve, at least for those of us coming from the user-friendly Windows environment. And the help you find online seems to refer to a myriad of different interfaces and menu layouts, since Adobe seemingly changes everything with every new version. Yuck."
4,SOME OF MY BEST FRIENDS ARE BLACK.....,"They just better not try to date anyone in my family. It's a shame that we still live in a society were people (minorities included) can't see past the color of a persons skin.This movie puts the spotlight on the harsh reality that this type of thing goes on everyday, in every community. What a shame!I recommend this movie..."
2,Can dissolve into slime,"I echo the other reviewer about replacing this regularly. My filter disolved into a lump of sludge. Hope it doesn't plug up the rest of my plumbing. I've used Pentek filters for years with no issues, but these filters just broke down and washed away. Literally a pile of paper and two rubber end caps floating around in the housing."
5,Work great for rural well water,This filter works very well to help remove sediment from our well water. We notice a huge difference in water quality when we regularly change the filter.
3,"Good for pain reliefe, not for massage","Sombra does relieve pain when applied, but it turns to water when you use it, until it absorbs. I recommend you apply it for analgesic effect, if you're an LMT or bodywork and want a warming gel for use in massage, use Prossage Heat instead. You will still need a regular massage oil in addition to Prossage."
5,Good for severe pain,"A good friend of mine who is a chiropractor recommended this product to me. She said her business partner first got this into their office and swore by it.I purchased this for my wife. She sufffers from extreme pain in the shoulder, back and hips. There is not much out there that can help my wifes pain, but this seems to be helping. Its not a cure, but it does help with some pain relief so that she can get to sleep and rest. I now keep a bottle by the bed, and a spare bottle on stand-by. It is well worth the money and i would recommend giving this a go if you suffer from pain."
1,No show on product,"I was looking forward to giving this product as a gift, however, it did not arrive at all. I submitted a claim to Amazon and instead of a refund, I received a gift certificate, also not what I ordered. I will be more cautious when ordering through Amazon in the future."
3,Compatability,"The game was not compatable with Windows-7. The ad on line said it was a Windows application. When I received product, there was a note inside stating the game may or may not run in windows-7. The game stated Win 95/98 application. Seller should state this info with the product ad. I was promply refunded by this seller, minus shipping/handling and 15% restock fee. Plus I paid for return postage. It could have saved money, time and frustration if the program application had been with the ad. I did appreciate the sellers prompt service."
4,Straw is a name to be remembered..........,"Straw's ""Livin In Tha Negative"" is a groundbreaking music CD, and also comes with a DVD showing the Las Vegas ""Thug Life-style"" and it contains vivid and powerful images of growng up in what he refers to as ""Vietnam streets"".I think, that Straw is a rapper that will bring a breath of fresh sound to the entire hip-hop/rap world! If you haven't heard of him yet,I know you will! I don't mean to be ""blunt"",:-) I know he will be a lasting force in the entertainment industry.I especially enjoy the track ""Sleepless Nites"", I can really relate!! So buy this album, it's great! So roll a B, pour a glass of Hennessy for you and your Boo, and get freaky!!Oh, yeah, keep it real!"
1,Had to return,The description of what this product was about could have been more informative. I had to return it because it was not what I thought it would be.
2,Material change,"The grommets on the previous TEKTON tarps that I have purchased were brass. They are now, not only PLASTIC, but the opening is SMALLER!"
1,Buyer Beware! Fits 1st Gen. Ipods only!!!!,"The one thing that was not mention by Amazon is that this case is designed and intended for 1st generation ipods only! I purchased mine and was quite disappointed by the fact that Amazon failed to mention this important fact. Although the case is made of quality material and seem to fit my 20 GB ipod nicely, the two outer buttons above the click wheel will not be accessible once the ipod is in the case. But if all you want is something to hold your ipod, this may do the job as long as you are will to pay the listed price. I believe you can find something more functional for a cheaper price."
4,Tastes like ham,"I don't like beef jerky, but this is pretty good in small amounts, especially if you don't want to eat beef.It's a good option, but those who love the taste of the regular beef might not prefer it."
4,Assassins and Justice in the Old West,"Author Phillip Swatek weaves fact and fiction together in this page-turning historical novel. The extensive research into turn-of-the-century Oklahoma and its denizens, augmented by well-written and accessible narrative, adds up to a good book. Ada, Oklahoma, now a quiet Bible-belt ranching town, was a Wild West town of the first order, rife with killers and thieves. Go back in history as you read this book and learn the true story of what frontier citizens did to take control of their town."
3,great case but...,great case but the handle broke off after three weeks. same problem with my last case but it lasted 3 years before the handle broke. still like everything else about the case and the factory is going to replace this one for me.
5,Wind-up flashlight,"A great idea! Works well! A few winds and you have light! No hunting for batteries.Product arrived quickly, in good shape."
1,Does not work as advertised,This product does NOT work. I purchased 2 of these flashlights. Advertised as wind up for a minute and they work for an hour. Neither one work. You can wind them up for 10 minutes and they only stay lit for about 20 seconds. This flashlight is crap!!!! A total waste of money.
1,simply terrible,"I purchased this about a month ago and I have to say that I was very disappointed with it. First off the flashlight is enormous! Also, it's not very bright at all. When I received it there was a slight charge so I used it until it died and then cranked it up and it lasted for about 2 weeks on the one charge. When it died I cranked it again and it lasted for about 2 days. After that It would give me about 10 seconds of light and then I'd have to crank it for another 2 minutes to get 10 more seconds. Even though it was only 10 bucks I don't think it was worth it. After this crapped out on me I bought a mini flashlight from LL Bean that ran on one double A and it gives me about 50 hours of light on one battery. Plus it is much brighter. Even though I have to replace the battery once a month it's worth it."
1,Don't even think about buying this,"I bought 4 of them because they are a great idea, but after a few months of use, the rechargeable battery won't hold a charge anymore so they become useless. Threw all of them away."
1,Not Reliable in Emergency,"I bought three of these to keep in the emergency kits in my vehicles. Tested each before putting them into the kits. After being in storage for a couple years, I actually needed to use one of them a few weeks ago.IT DID NOT WORK.The entire purpose of an emergency light is, to provide light in an emergency. A crank dynamo is supposed to provide the power, to avoid the need to rely on batteries that can go stale during storage.I am buying new dynamo flashlights -- from some other manufacturer -- this week."
3,Taste isn't bad but...,"The taste is fine, but the texture is terrible. It's very gritty and feels like you're drinking sandy water. I mix it with a shaker and no amount of shaking takes the grittiness away. Maybe mixing with a blender wouldn't be so bad?"
3,Get what you pay for,"This product is very cheap for 5 lbs but it has a horrible texture, foams up when you make it in a shaker bottle and has an overall below average taste. Next time, i'll spend a couple extra bucks for better tasting protein."
1,Taste terrible,Compared to other protein powders I've used this is by far the worst. It taste bad and does not mix well in a blender bottle.
1,Not great taste and awful texture,"I got this on a deal through slickdeals, well I realized why it was on 1 of those deals. This stuff does not work well at all. The taste is very artificial and it leaves a horrible sandy feel in my mouth. I would blend it with a spoon in a glass for 30-40 seconds and it still didn't work very well. More or less just try to get it down as fast as possible. I got 1 of those blender bottles and that worked a lot better, but I would not recommend this product.As far as effectiveness it didn't seem to work all that great. I did not notice any gains so to speak. I work out pretty regular and am not someone who just decided to do this for new years. I have worked out 6 days a week for probably the last 8 years, so I feel I can comment on the effectiveness of these types of products."
3,Good and bad,"I read quite a few of the reviews... and the best description of the taste i got was ""tastes like chocolate flavored cardboard""... which is the same impression I got. But don't complain. Protein powder isnt supposed to be a replacement for milk shake. 25G of proteins a serving is actually very good. and for this price... complaining about the taste is just ""nit picking"".I am a bit dissapointed that the can i got didnt have a paper air tight seal. I was hoping to store it till the ""Gold Standard"" im using now, finished. Now i use these two side by side because i don't want it to go bad. Yes It has the shrink wrap around the lid... but the paper air tight seal inside the lid was missing (The paper seal was found in the BSN and ON stuff i got). Hence the three stars..."
3,Not the best,"An OK protein. The taste was on par or worse than others I've tried (ON Gold Standard), and it was difficult to mix. There are better options out there but when this is on a low price sale, I tend to grab one to keep on hand in case my other protein runs out. I would try a different protein first before risking your money on this one if you are looking for something that mixes well and tastes great. If you're looking for just your basic protein, this will get you by..."
2,Good price and quick shipment but thats about it,"I recieved this product within three days with super saver. I was impressed with that and the cost. It say's instantized but it's not. A spoon will disolve a true instantized powder. A blender has to be used and that wasn't what I was looking for. Smells good but not very tastey, most protein powders arent so that didnt bother me too much."
4,TGB+1,"It makes my daughter want to go to the potty and practice, which is good. The book is silly, but I guess it gets to the point."
5,Cover the emotional realities of toilet training,"This book was absolutely instrumental in toilet training my daughter. We ha dseveral other books on toilet training (such as ""Elmo's Potty Time"") which covered the mechanics, but I loved the way this book approaches the mixed emotions children feel in potty training. As I read it to my daughter we discussed how she sometimes feels angry at the potty, how she would rather play than sit on the potty, and how after she masters these emotions, she can feel pride in her accomplishment. She identified with the child pictured in the book and the emotions portrayed in a cute and fun way. Over and over again she said ""Just like ME!"" as I read her the book. The more we read it, the more excited and optimistic she became about potty training. I compared the book to several others in the store including ""Once Upon a Potty"" and this seemed to me to connect at an appropriate level and address difficulties and emotions in a gentle and fun way."
3,okay book,"I like this book well enough, and so does my 2-year-old son. I don't like that the kid in the book keeps saying that ""this potty's not for me"" and that he doesn't want to try it. The kid ends up doing it, but I don't like the start. And it isn't small flaps like I thought it would be, it is the whole page that flips open to another page, which is kindof hard to do and read it to someone else. But it is a good introduction to the whole potty thing, which I guess is the point."
2,Not To Sure About This Book,"Let me first mention that I am a huge fan of Karen Katz's books. However, this book was a big disappointment. Instead of teaching the child how to use the potty, the story contradicts using the potty. The child in the book spends most of the time rejecting the potty. This book basically confused my child and I stop reading it. The illustrations are great, but the story indicates that this particular child is not ready to use the potty. The lack of encouragement and motivation of potty training in this story is not great at all."
2,Poor potty training,"If you are only going to buy a couple of books to get your child interested in the potty training process,this is not the one for you. It is very boring and it really does not make it fun or educational. I expected something great like where is the babies bellybutton? However, this was really disappointing."
3,Potty for Me,The story is great. The only thing I didn't like was the flaps they make the book kind of hard to handle and it is hard for my two year old to flip through. They don't fold back the best.
5,Potty for Me book,"This is a cute book for children who are starting to potting training. My daughter loves this book, I would recommend it."
3,"You give a little, you take a little...","This book contains some of the most wonderful music ever composed, which are perfect in themselves, yet this book has several flaws in its presentation of them: You will find that the print is somewhat small in this book, which is good or bad, depending upon your eyesight. And the last major issue I found (besides the fact that the book doesn't contain ""all"" of the Preludes and Fugues) was that there were several page turns which were placed in rather undesirable places. But as the title of this review suggests, for such an inexpensive price, the book serves its basic duty."
1,G5 Freezes,"This was my first mac. Panther is great, and I enjoy working on it. BUT, this machine crashes at least once a day. The screen freezes, and I can move the mouse, but that's it. You have to reboot.If not for this problem, the G5 is a 5 star product, but this problem makes the machine nearly useless. Definetly not worth the price.[...]"
1,Worthless!!,"Don't waste your money on this item. It sheds bits of feather everywhere. I tried shaking it, vacuuming it off, rinsing it in water and still it SHEDS!! Had to throw it away as it wasn't worth the time and money to return it."
1,Feathers all fell out,"We purchased 4 of these in late Sept 2012 to rotate in our small house cleaning service. It's early Dec 2012 and the last one just fell apart. Seller was responsive when the first one fell apart, hoping that we can get through a smooth return. Still looking for quality feather dusters.Company was very responsive in taking care of a timely full refund."
5,Good product,"Do not bother with the fake feather dusters or other dusters if you use on plastic, like an audio Turntable dust cover. This will work without scratching the easily scratched cover or anything else for that matter."
2,"14"" Genuine Ostrich Feather Duster with Wood Handle",The feather dusters are very small and thin and not at all like what is pictured in the promotion. I'm going to have to tape both of these together in order to approximate the fullness and feather count of the one I've got now.
2,Loosing feather,i did not like it too much because it looses a lot feather. when cleaning it makes everywhere feather and not really good
4,Should be on every Producer's bookshelf,"Simply a well written and entertaining book that really gives you great insight into being a film Producer. Keep in mind the studios and the industry works differently now a days, but Turman makes this read a must. He removes the secrecy of The Producers role in Hollywood and he really drives home the point of how committed you must be in your goals, passion and drive to make a film happen.Great book, quick read and well worth it. I reread sections of it to get inspired."
1,Not worth it,Way to many wires after one ride they quite working. I did not drive in water at all but after further inspection after washing my vehicle it caused the whole thing to short out. I removed and went with a much better light as I was removing noticed four of the leds were corroded.
3,A little info and a lot of filler,I didn't find this very interesting or inspirational and it definitely didn't provide any new or intriguing technique.A google search and 10 minutes reading will reveal far more in depth and useful information.I would advise against purchasing.
2,Vomit Gore? More like Vomit Bore!,"These movies manage to make both graphic violence and full frontal nudity boring. Add to that some of the most annoying (not creepy, just annoying) sound design in film history and you are left with literally no reason to buy this. It isn't even worth it for the morbid curiosity, I know because I bought for that exact reason. Don't repeat my mistake. Don't buy this movie."
5,real blues,great if you love the blues. thanks to nap for keeping real blues alive. the album is great. could use more of songs like these. wonderful job on the wedding pledge.
4,A gift!,I hope that this book will help her teach her own daughter how to be as self reliant as she is. I didn't actually read it. The purchase was made as a result of a review in the NY Times. Maybe she'll lend it to me one day.
5,a wonderful guidline,this book is very easy to read and very enjoyable.i found myself learning so many things about my own jewishness along with some ideas for how to help my child find hers.i love this book and bought several more copies to give to the other jewish moms in my moms group.by the way -- while i was finishing up the last chapters...my brother and his wife happened to send me a copy of this book...they had no idea i was reading it and i found it totally randomly while searching amazon for jewish books.
5,The Blessing Of A Skinned Knee: Using Jewish Teachings to Raise Self-Reliant Children,Excellent Parenting book.The Blessing Of A Skinned Knee: Using Jewish Teachings to Raise Self-Reliant Children
4,"sweltering explosion of trance, mixed by one of the masters!",Nick Warren has really done it this time. This is his first non- Way Out West compilation that does his skills justice. He really wraps you up in a warm blanket of trance and moves you to places you've never been before. He moves in and out of mixes very well and really explodes in transition. This is the second best Global Undergound yet outside of Sasha in Ibiza. Nick Warren is the man!!
5,Easy handling,because cooking easycheapermy friend toled me go to on line and buy this product . because he used it .
3,Dimensions are only 14inch cook surface,Read the description of the product very carefully - the cook surface is only 14 inches wide (stated in the description). The reference to 18-inch diameter in the dimensions is because the feet of the cooker stick out an additional 2 inches all around (thus 4 additional inches of diameter). I misread this and assumed I would have an 18inch cook surface which would work for my 1/2 barrel homebrew system - I didn't and a 1/2 barrel won't fit properly on this cook surface.If you need 18 inches of cooking surface look at the Bayou Classic SP2 Double Jet Cooker [Amazon product ID=B001FTS32W - for some reason a product link isn't working here].
4,nice burner,"It's a great burner. The only thing I'd change about it is paint that burns off on the first use. Don't breath the blue smoke, nasty stuff."
3,Hot but bulky,I found it too big and bulky. It needs a windguard at the bottom in a bad way . However it is very hot!
5,"This burner ""rocks""","Have had this burner about 6 weeks now, and it ""rocks"". I use it as part of my homebrewing set-up and it has worked as expected through the first 4 beers I have brewed with it, and I plan to fire it up and brew again this weekend. Thanks Amazon."
4,Great little burner,"I would have given this a 5 star review, except that it took about 3 hours to burn off all the paint fumes from the burner during a test boil. That basically killed about 1/4 of my tank of propane and smelled terrible. Other than that, it is a powerful, efficient and FUN alternative to the grill or stove top. I used it twice already to make a couple batches of 6-gallon beer, and it worked great! Went from steeping at 160`F to a rolling boil in under 10 minutes. Highly recommended."
2,Poorly constructed,Paint peeled and flaked off almost immediately on firing the SP10 up. Why coat a gas cooker with a paint that won't stand the heat? The burner is misaligned so the flames don't hit center of the pot. Sharp edges on the legs cut my finger the first time I used it. It does what it says on the box but clearly made to a price.
1,not as advertised,"As I received this product from ""Lawn and Patio"", one of the burner legs was sticking 6 inches thru the bottom of the original Bayou Classic box. The solution? Put it into another more flimsy box and ship it. Luckily the product itself is quite sturdy and didn't appear damaged.However, I have realized that the unit did not ship with the 20 psi regulator/hose assy, but 10 psi (55000 btu) which has a different end fitting which means I will have to buy more parts to get what I want. At least another $27. The way Amazon does things it is way less than obvious what to do when something like this happens. Usually a lot of effort to get nowhere.I believe the product itself is probably fine. I suggest buying from another vendor not associated with Amazon."
2,broke after 2 uses,"The regulator starting spewing gas (dangerous!) after two uses. I purchased a replacement regulator from bayou and it broke after one use. Cheap stuff, only buy if you can afford to replace it, truly."
4,Used or Returned,"The cooker I got was missing two screws, and there was visible marks in package. So, I doubt it was a returned one. Any way, I started using it and working good."
5,Complete Guide for Installing and Configuring Openswan,"I bought this book to setup Openswan IPSec on Linux server that would connect to a Watchguard Firebox. Since the Linux distro was Slackware, I got to go through the entire build and setup procedure (which, dispite the author's distain for Slackware, was not as bad as seems). The book covers theory and operation of IPSec in general as well as the details of installing (from binary distributions and source tar balls) and configuring Openswan IPSec and overcoming the bumbs encountered getting it all running.Included are details and problems of making Openswan work with other IPSec devices, such as Watchguard (in my case), Cisco and Microsoft's IPSec implementation. And when dealing with connecting to Microsoft, they deal with the problems you will encounter and how to work through them.If you are planning to setup IPSec on a Linux server using Openswan, you'll want this book at your side to help guide you through the entire process."
5,Great Compilation of a Great Team,"Loved all the songs. It was great to be re-introduced to a group that is still on the cutting edge today, over 15 years after they 1st appeared on the scene."
4,"Could have been better, yet still a jem.","This album showcases some of Yaz's best work. Unfortunately it leaves out many great songs like ""Softy Over"" ""Unmarked"" ""Sweet Thing"" & ""Didn't I Bring Your Love Down."" It would have been nice if this album would have contained ""The Other Side of Love."" However, the addition of the previously unavailable ""Tuesday"" made this album worthwhile for me. This song is lavish in texture and pulls you into it. It's harsh realism combined with its well orchestrated sound makes it one of my favorite Yaz songs."
4,NIV Mom's Devotional Bible,"It wasn't the one pictured it was actually a older version. But, It was fairly good condition."
2,Projected images are very dull,"This item is functional, but fails to project well--the light isn't bright enough to project a good color image. Also, the user instructions written in English are not very literate, extremely difficult to follow."
3,Good characters in a modest movie,"Rosanna Arquette and Eric Roberts, especially, are very good in this movie. Their budding relationship and the unfolding of their ambitions for the future, circumscribed by their clear limitations, weaknesses, and past histories, is interesting and worthwhile. Unfortunately I was distracted by what I felt were cheap laughs at the expense of many characters, including Arquette's ridiculous birthday-balloon costume, the incompetence at the acting workshops, and the characters at her workplace. While it was insightful that Arquette was vilified for actions that would be easy to forget in a big city, her family's nature would be enough to place her at the margins of society. Pretty good and worth seeing, too bad it wasn't better."
1,Where is my Handsfree headset?,"I recived sony my cell is motorola so I send back to you ,I have,nt got my hands- Free Headset yet. You have charge to my credit card.so i like to know what happen to my order.please let me know .Thank you"
4,MINT CONDITION IS THE BEST.,MINT CONDITION IS ONE OF THE BEST BANDS TODAY. I REALLY LIKE THERE CD. THE BEST SONG IS IF YOU LOVE ME.
2,Loosing that Mint originality...,"A long-term Mint fan, I was displeased with this one. Mint Condition seems to be taking the generic hip-hop route that many other R&B bands are selling out to. Gone are the salsy interludes that show just how well this band can jam--they are replaced with electronic hip-hop loops. A handful of the songs retain Mint's original groove, but the majority attempt to break into the mainstream by emulating music that's been prooven to sell records..."
2,"Well, it's a matter of taste, but...","First, just as long as you know, it's 'still' not carbonated.Second, there's very little flavor.Third, there's no detectable taste of passion fruit, which is what I bought it for.Finally, not much taste of orange."
3,Portable but slow,"This is a great product for the mobile professional. It is a little slow but alot better that going to a local store like Kinkos for mobile printing, and alot cheaper. Overall, it is a great product"
1,Fair replacement,"I've since revised my original 3 stars to drop to 1. Part broke within 3 months of use. Mower was kept in a climate controlled garage. Spend the extra 10 bucks to go to a sears and buy the OEM part that works much better.Also, I'm still waiting for the replacement part to come back. I was told it takes 1-2 weeks for the part to come back once they receive it. Meanwhile, my lawn continues to grow."
3,Tedious,"The author purports to update the previous (third) edition of his book. However, there are numerous places (see pp. 81, 176, 186, 193, and 197) in the book that suggest that there was no update other than Chapters 15-17 which are actually in a different type from the rest of the book. For example, the book stills discusses the Soviet Union in the present tense. With respect to the content of the book, the author spends all of 10 pages, 12 pages if one includes the map of Cuba, discussing the indigenous people of Cuba. The discussion of Castro's rule is tedious. The analysis of the future of Cuba after Castro is obvious and superficial. Save your money."
5,HANK III rOcKs!!!,"Love this guys music..He is a true artist in his field . His songs are very well written. The bandand him are excellent musicians also..Definately get this CD and if you get a chance see his show live he is GREAT..have seen him about 5 times now..First time saw him was opening for DWIGHT YOAKAM at the""GREEK THEATER"" in L.A..since that have been following all that he has done...."
4,early hank 3,"This is not what hank is today but you can see where he is headed from it, it still sounds great if you like twangy country, cocaine blues is a great remake."
1,very poor aid for mastering French,This is one of the useless tool for learing French. It does not do anything that it is said to learners of French. The sound files are very poor and speakers talk the way only fluent people can understand it. Generally very poor and non very effective to master french. I would never ever recommend it to any one. Ultimae French editions are much better with sounds and methodology but little advanced for begginers. So don't waist your money with this book.
5,Gripping,"I borrowed ""Dancehall"" several years ago, and remembered how much I enjoyed it. The story takes place in the Adirondacks. Not that far from my home town of Albany. Which was another reason I bought the book this time. I could relate to it's locale. The story is not so much a ""who done it"", but why was an innocent young girl murdered in the first place. It's a story of jealously, betrayal, and wrongly accused. I highly recommend it!Steve..."
5,A must-have for anyone interested in the history of jewelry!,"So many books written today about jewelry tend to be heavy on beautiful images, but lacking in useful information. Toni Greenbaum's Messengers of Modernism is truly an exception. With its well written introduction, the author places these jewelers within the cultural context of their time, providing us with a glimpse of the creative environment that fostered such fabulous works. The book is profusely illustrated and highlights the careers of each jeweler/artist. The inclusion of period photos is an added bonus and hints of the artists' individual personalities. Messengers of Modernism is a valuable reference for anyone interested in this fascinating period of jewelry history."
5,Sausage investigation sausage,"Ahh, they don't make em like this anymore, not that I'd know. This is one of the funniest blinking movies I've seen in ages."
2,"Not anywhere stinky enough, nor itchy enough...","I thought I would be the life of the party when my friend Barry decided to throw one. I showed up with three of these packets, along with some whoopie-cushions, rubber chickens, and hand buzzers and boy was I disappointed. These things didn't even measure up to one of my most gasseous passings after a day of eating at my local Mexican establishment. And the itching powder? I've been itchier after rolling around on the grass over at Donny Markus' house. This was just a total waste. The fake dog vomit went over well, as well as the fly in the plastic ice, but avoid these."
1,Wow! What a disappointment!,"After only printing a few documents, my ink is already not working! It seems to not be able to print browns and such correctly. I will not purchase from this supplier again. From now on, I will go to an office supply store like I have in the past. I feel much more confident about their product and customer service should a problem arise."
5,ink use from shopping amazon so much,I use amazon for all shopping. They take great care of you. I'm allways printing invoces....The ink is perfect!!!!! The Price is awsome!!!
2,'66 Series a Yawner,"This is unquestionably the dullest World Series highlight film of the 1960s. Utterly and almost comically inept at the plate, the Dodgers were never in it, as they were swept by the underdog Orioles. This version of the Baltimore Orioles was the progenitor of the mini-dynasty O's of a few years hence. The highlights of this film are few: Brooks Robinson's jaunty home run trot in Game One at Dodger Stadium, Willie Davis's three centerfield miscues in one inning in Game Two, cancer victim and former Orioles' catcher Dick Brown tossing out the first ball in Game Three (Brown had only a few months to live.), and young Jim Palmer besting Sandy Koufax in Koufax's last game ever in Game Four."
2,NOT THE BEST URBAN LEGEND BOOK,"This book calls it self the best urban myth book ever but its hardly that. they left out many poular legends such as the death car. They fill it up with ones that are pointless. Any way the correct tile for one of the storys is urban legends not urban myths. if you want to read a book n this subject read the baby train, the mexican pet."
5,Gray squirrel swish your bushy tail!,"If you are going to sing the preschool song, ""Gray squirrel, gray squirrel, swish your bushy tail,"" then you need to have this little finger puppet. He is actually more of a hand puppet. Your finger fits up inside his chest, and then you are able to move the little squirrel around, and you are able to ""swish his bushy tail"" to the delight of any young children who will learn to sing the song with you: ""Gray squirrel, gray squirrel, swish your bushy tail! Wrinkle up your funny nose. Hold a nut between your toes. Gray squirrel, gray squirrel, swish your bushy tail!"""
3,STAY WITH LONESOME DOVE,I love Larry McMurtry's writing for its own sake but found this book to be a little over the top. Instead read any of the four great books from the Lonesome Dove series.
3,Cuter in the picture,"The color is kinda of mottled... Orange, brown and black color. I think a nice gray with a white belly would be much cuter. The whiskers are flaccid and set too far back giving a ratty appearance. The ears need to be pushed forward to give them a fuller Mickey Mouse look rather than a sleeked back, angry rat look. Tail is literally a piece of beige string. Not horrible and certainly worth the $3 but it looks much cuter in the picture."
3,Just fine!,"I'd say this is only worth a few bucks. It's a 'cute' toy. Nothing to write home about. The ""puppet"" part is a little ridiculousness. CUte and fine."
4,Fabulous Fushion,"Not sure why this is currently out of print, but this is one fine outing from the Tribal Tech boys.Scott Henderson & Gary Willis have done it again (along with messers Kinsey & Covington). This music is adventurous and inspiring, not to mention impeccably played. Boy can these guys tear it up.It's a shame that this 2000 release appears to be their last. Maybe someday they'll get back together and do it again. If you ever get a chance, go see them live. You'll not be disappointed. :)"
2,"Riddles, not analogies","This book presents far more word games than analogies--the relationships between the words presented are too often not the type seen in the SCAT test, or the ""old"" SAT. This is not a book to use if you want to prepare your child for the SCAT (testing to join the Johns Hopkins Talented Youth program, for example). I have taken (and scored very well on) many tests with analogies and studied and prepared my daughter for the SCAT, and was hoping this book would be useful for my son. I was ready to throw it across the room. The ""right"" answers for the relationships between the word pairs are often absurd, or based on the physical appearance of the letters in the word--or, the answer is incorrectly given because it mixes up the word pairs, and the actual pairings make no sense at all!Instead, get Daily Warm Ups: Analogies; it is a GREAT book, though it leaves you needing more practice."
5,Such fun and such wonderful brain training!,"Excellent book to break down the anatomy of the analogy. Readers will learn every type of analogy, how to analyze it, and some awesome vocabulary as well. Good for ages 8 and up."
5,Good Challenge,This game gives you different units from the previous versions. It is nice to have more variety of units and buildings. Much more challenging than prior versions.
4,More of what was already a good game,"BTS is a good addition to a already good game.More civilizations,more tech to follow by expanding the tech tree,more units and iteven has all the content from WarLords minus scenarios.All in all more reason to spend hours on the PC trying to conquer the world."
1,Addictive piece of crap,I bought this game for my husband as well as the expansion pack. This is game is annoying as hell. He never leaves the damn computer. I want to smash this game into a million pieces.
1,THS IS NO A STRATEGY GAME!,"This is NOT a strategy game!!! I have Rifle man getting killed by pike man and Archers; moreover, I have Panzer tanks being destroyed buy Horse archers and Mace man... The idea of the game is to get better technologies than your rival; however, it really doesn't matter how far ahead you are. When the enemy attacks, and when they're far behind in technologies, it's still one to one per unit. The game's units are far more effective than yours are. Again... THIS IS NOT A STRATEGY GAME!!!"
4,My Life As A Girl,"When I first went to the book store to find a summer reading book, I thought that reading all summer would bore me. But, as I looked from shelf to shelf, I found Elizabeth Mosiers, ""My Life As A Girl."" I read the quotes on the back of the book and I found that this might actually keep me involved. That day, I began to read the book. I couldn't stop. This book kept me very interested. I enjoyed how Jaime had difficulties that I once had. She had to deal with her father gambling her money away, I've had to deal with my father spending my money for bad reasons. I also found that she had to cope with her boyfriend. She and I had many things in common. That is a reason I liked this book. The one thing I did ot like about this story was how the plot differs. First, it is present day, then it is the past and soon we're talking about the future, that had confused me a bit. In conclusion, this book had a great overall story line, and I would give it 4 stars."
2,Not worth it!,"The only that keeps me from giving this book the lowest rating is respect for the effort that goes into writing. Mosier's story is scattered and somewhat inconclusive and has an out of place, and weak ending! Borrow from a friend or rent it from the library!"
5,Worked great!,I got this fryer for Christmas. I fryed my first turkey on Christmas Day and it turned out Great! I am very happy with this product!
4,Good starter book for guitar lessons,My 11 year old daughter got a guitar for Christmas and was recommended this book by her music teacher. She's taken to the instrument and this book has been good at explaining certain techniques and explaining what is important to take from each lesson.All in all its a good starter book that seems to progress nicely along as the student learns - giving background on female musicians and how they got into playing guitars.
1,Do girls play or learn the guitar different than boys?,"I am not sure why a beginning guitar book needs to be gender specific. Does this mean that other beginning guitar books are meant for boys and are either to easy or to hard for girls? Maybe I am reading to much into the title. What is different about an instructional guitar book for girls? It seems to me that knowing the gender of the child would be the least important factor in selecting a book on learning how to play an instrument. That is, unless we have discovered that having butterflies, flowers, pink and blue guitars makes girls learn guitar better. I thought, as a society, we had out-grown these gender issue myths. I am sorry but I saw this book at a music store yesterday and it just bugged me."
5,Fabulous explanation of God for small children,"I've read hundreds of books with my four year old and this one is the best! Began reading it to her at age two and the rhyme and the explanation of God's gentle love in the book are a sheer pleasure. I plan to buy one for every child in her preschool class ...great pictures, too!"
4,a nice griddle,"I used this griddle a lot this last summer - works great on a gas stove, but then I tried it on an electic stove top and it warped - not it's fault entirely, the stove top was old and I couldn't regulate the heat."
4,A Good Movie That Is Loosely Based On A True Story!,"I like Helen Hunt, she is one of my favorite actresses I have seen several of the made for television movies that she had made when she was a kid and a teenager and The Quarterback Princess was one of my favorites and I would like to see this movie put on DVD! Okay, I don't think it's fair to jump to conclusions that Tammy and her family had anything to do with the changes in her story that the film makers made. They always take true stories and make changes and the story always comes out loosely based on the true stories so it may be possible that the Maidas didn't even know that the movie was going to not tell the full story and honestly I really I don't give a fig that the movie isn't 100% faithful to the actual story about Tammy! Not only do I think this movie should be on DVD but her other old made for television movies should be on DVD too, especially The inspirational movie The Miracle of Kathy Miller which is also a fact based movie!"
3,Good quality,The picture quality was good for being a rental VHS. Hadn't seen this movie since it was originally shown on TV
2,DMX FlowPak just a lump of air under my foot.,"I've worn Rockport ProWalkers for at least ten years. A week ago I bought the new Astride ProWalker with the DMX FlowPak technology. While they felt okay in the store, after wearing them for a few hours my feet began to hurt where the DMX FlowPak is located (just below the balls of my feet). I've worn these shoes for a week now and they continue to hurt my feet. This ""revolutionary"" DMX FlowPak is nothing but an air pouch in the sole of the shoe. Nothing about it ""flows"" as I walk. These are the most uncomforable ProWalkers I've ever owned. I'm going to try to return these shoes, but my shoe store has a no return policy. I've contacted Rockport customer service. We'll see what type of response I get."
2,Full of inconsistencies and errors,"How in the know is Leamer? He calls Radney Foster ROdney; he calls Shania's breakout album WHOSE BED HAVE YOUR BOOTS BEEN UNDER (which was the first single from THE WOMAN IN ME, the album's real title) in at least three places (in the same chapter); and derides one star's album as ""only"" having reached number two on Billboard's charts. Author tries too hard to expose all the singers as hypocrites (Garth, Wynonna and Naomi, Reba, LeAnn) and it gets tiresome, whether you like country music or not--and I do."
1,This country music fan (AND AUTHOR) doesn't like this book!,"I have been a country music fan for many years and in the last 3 years, I've been to over 250 concerts, attended 3 Fan Fairs(1996,97,98), and I've met over 50 artists backstage! The fact that this book 'EXPOSES' the private moments of some of the country stars really angered me. I am also an author of country music and I too, had a lot of inside information on the private lives of the country stars! However, it was my opinion that their privacy overrides any profit I would gain by disclosing such information. This is, in my opinion, a book that should have never been written for the sake of the privacy of the country music stars!"
4,Nice item for the Land Before Time fan in your home!!!,"Great book, although I know....it is just a coloring book! However, Land Before Time items are are hard to find and my daughter just loved it!"
1,"did not even drill out one mild carbon steel bolt, dull with in a few seconds","tried several bits, even was running them in a cordless drill to have slower speed that my big dewalt gear drive drill.a mild steel bolt just dulled bits like they were made of plastic.definatly not worth what i paid."
3,"Worked once, but not after that - limited application","I bought these to remove stripped allen head bolts on my auto's camshaft pulley. It worked once, but after that, the bolts just would strip down without actually grabbing hold.Because these bolt extractors are so short, you need a lot of clearance around the bolt to get a proper perpendicular angle - it's the only way it'll take hold and actually pull the bolt out. Any slight angle and it will just tear away at it. It definitely is strong enough to drill through the bolt, which is good.For small space applications, it may not work and may be better to find a left hand drill bit set. It may require drilling through the bolts until the heads come off and then using the extractor set (or pliers) to grab the rest still in the hole."
5,I love this show!!,"This series is an absolute favorite of mine! I don't watch TV often with my busy schedule, ut this is one show I take time to watch. Love Supernatural!!!"
3,Interesting,"There's a lot of interesting material here. However, it could be put together in a better, more scholarly fashion. One hopes an author will come along and do that. Does the book support Mormon beliefs? No, but it indicates pre-columbus Christianity in North America which requires that someone (or some people) visited here (i.e. Vikings, Irish, etc). It also does not erase the problems surrounding Joseph Smith."
4,good performance for the $,"The assembly instructions left a little to the imagination, and a few washers were missing, but I'm fairly adept so I got it together. The sliding charcoal drawer is a great idea and handy, but the end doesn't fit properly over the opening and the gaps allow air into the grill when I want to seal it to kill the coals. On the up-side, the cooking performance is excellent. A deeper bed of coals generates volcanic heat, and a shallow bed generates a long, steady heat perfect for slow-roasting a turkey or marinated pork shoulder. Yum!"
2,"Not bad maps, worthless directions","The only value I have in this product is exporting a local map to my PDA. Other than that, Street & Trips is far superior. The automated directions are worthless. They don't pick the fastest route, they don't pick the shortest route, and they go fictitious near the end of the route. As an example, if I map a route from my office to my house, it takes a meander through side streets instead of travelling down the street I work on to the highway, then, when it does eventually get on the highway, the directions say to take the highway directly to my house, rather than getting off the highway and taking the 3 streets needed to do so. The map display shows the intended route taking a straight line through the woods between my house and the highway near the end as well."
1,Rand McNally Street Finder & Trip Maker,"This software ONLY HAS MAPS FOR THE LARGEST 82 CITIES IN THE USA. Don't get caught out of the city, or you will be lost......Pretty useless.... The product description leads you to believe this software covers the entire US, but once you get into it, you have to be in 1 of 82 cities.....it does say it in one place hidden on the box if you look closely....very misleading."
1,About the worst horror Ive ever seen....,"Pick any house on any street.Pick any random two people(Man and Woman), give them a script and let them go wild.I promise you could make this movie work better than the producers.Nothing in this movie stood out and everything about it was boring.The acting and settings in this movie are just horrible. By the end you WANT everyone to die just to become interested.Now, I don't usually give bad ratings and I really like ""B"" horror films, but the lack of effort here is unbelievable.Just nothing to interest me."
1,What a waste...,"This movie is so bad that I couldn't even watch the whole thing and as soon as it was over I felt the urge to write this review so that other are not fooled to watch it as well. The front cover looks amazing, and I was expecting something similar to it or that it had some resemblance to it... But I was dissapointed. This movie actually deserves a 5 NEGATIVE stars if that was possible. It is a SHAME for Amazon.com to sell this kind of crap, I bet my dog makes a more interesting movie.Everything is terrible, including acting, landscape, the house and even the cat!! The director should be ashamed of participating in this garbage. PLEASE, DON'T WATCH OR BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!! IT'S NOT EVEN WORTH 5 CENTS!! BEWARE... AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS!! DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GO FOR A WALK INSTEAD!!!"
4,oil filter,Same as can be puchased in an Auto supply except at a lesser cost. Purchasing on line and having it shopped to my house is very convient.
1,The worst Physical Chemistry Book ever written,This book is used at Rutgers University and no one including the professors had one good thing to say about it. It is both confusing and unreadable. I have never encountered a book that is as useless as this book....save yourself money and go to you college library and check out Ira Levine or any other P-chem. book not written by Atkins. I cannot understand why universities across the world use this book. In my entire life I have never had to struggle through a class as much as I have had to struggle through this class and this is mostly due to Atkins inability to explains the topic of physical chemistry in a clear manner.
1,"Like Overcooked Fish, dry","If you are a completely dry and boring person, then this is the text for you. That's the reason I believe that others rate this book so high. First of all, having a grasp of the concept has nothing to do with the reading of this terrible book. It is awful, and I recommend that you look for something better. Atkins may just have well put this in greek. If you have nothing better to do with your time, then by all means read this God foresaken nonsense. Yet, if you really want to learn P. Chem, then I strongly suggest that you check out the book by David W. Ball. The book is simply entitled Physical Chemistry, and it really makes sense. I love the Ball book so much! It's a huge improvement over Atkins. I don't care what any of the other reviews say, this Atkins book is horrendous. (...) It is clear, concise, easy to follow, has great examples, and really explains P. Chem. (...)"
1,"useless, expensive, confusing","I am a lecturer for a P-Chem course and I found this book terrible. It didn't help students learning at all. Problems given at the end of every chapters might be good for practice. However, it won't help you a lot in understanding the beauty of P-Chem course."
5,"what a book! by Guillaume Fontan,11","This book is absolutly the best tsunami book ever.(thats why its rated 5 stars.)There is one tiny problem,though.You don't find out if one of the main characters is a boy or a girl until the end. Otherwise the book is almost full of action and suspence.Recomended to all buyers."
1,"This is a BAD novel, not a travel book.","This is a novel about a group of fundamentalist Christians trying to escape Romania through the forests and across rivers to Yugoslavia during the 1980s. I thought it was a travel book that would be useful in planning my trip to Romania and Bulgaria. I was very wrong. If you like novels from the Jerry Falwell press, you might enjoy this book. Otherwise, save your money. I must admit that I read only about 50 pages before I tossed it."
4,A pretty good read.,"This book opens a door to possibilities that might be real. His basic point is soild, and amazing in it's simplicity. He relates the change in orbital rotation with that of the migration of the magnodynamic flux of the Earth. This, while is completely well known in the world of geology, is little understood elsewhere. That is too bad, because his theories answer many questions....many that cannot be answered using the current accepted evolutionary theories. This is not a book for someone to read cold turkey. I would suggest some fine books on alternative science and history first. But once read, his points are clear and stunning. Was there a global seafaring culture in 75,000 BC? I don't know, but he certainly has opened the door to speculation."
2,Formula typo errors makes the first edition unreadable.,"A good text but wait for the next edition before purchasing.The text contains numerous typographical errors in it'sformulas. Bounds of intergration, and summation aremissing, as well as, numerical values. Equations withoutboounds in DSP theory is useless"
5,Slept on...,"This album is really great. I don't know why Davina has been so slept on. I love the texture of her voice. It's a little like Mary J's but does not seem at all unoriginal. She does a cover of Michael Jackson's ""can't Help It"" and it makes me wonder if anyone who had a part in Mary's ""All That I Can Say"" heard this and thought they should sample that bass to go with her voice. Yes, I am actually wondering if Mary J bit off of this girl. That's how good I think she sounds.In particular, my favorite song is ""So Good"". I love to listen to it in headphones. All the vocals blend so nice, I just put it on repeat."
3,Nyman's Two Pieces,"This CD has two pieces by english composer Michael Nyman. The first is the score for the movie ""The Piano"". This is a well known piece, and its cliched, new age-y undertones made it not very good one in my opinion. The second is more promising: called MGV (french for Music at Great Speed), it was commisioned apparently for the unveiling of a high speed train in Europe, and this great piece really suggests of trains and railways."
1,Very Flat&Boring,I Dig Old Jodeci.but their's a Reason Why Mr.Delvin Never Sung On Their Records.The Material here&His Voice are Both Flat.I Dug The Cut Dangerous with DeVante but aside from that it's Pretty Weak.what's so funny is that He had the nerve to say that he had been Listening too Old Michael Jackson Albums FOr Inspiration? More Like Michael Jackson The Beer Columist.I Hope Jodeci Comes Out with a New Disc&Keep Mr.Dalvin in His Place Away from The Main Mike.
1,Garbage,"Being a big Jodeci fan, I expected a lot from this one. So how is it? Lemme just say that if I made a list of the ten worst albums I have ever bought, Metamorphic would be on that list. He is a horrible singer and the songwriting is horrendous. I would say two tracks are just average. And everything else is simply garbage."
1,WTF!!,Just listening to the sampler on amazon.com is reason enough NOT to purchase this cd. This is a hot mess!
5,good price,"Good quality / resolution.connected PC to LCD TV and couldnt be happier. Movies are true HD.pc: Asus Maximus Formula, Nvidia HD video 9800gtx, Intel Q6600tv: Toshiba Regza U 42"" 720p LCD"
5,This HDMI to DVI cable Works Perfect with PS3!,This cable works perfect! I have no problems with it. Its been over a year now and still no issues. The picture is razor sharp on my old Toshiba 34 inch CRT HDTV! The price is unbeatable and the gold plating will last for years more. I recommend this product if you have an old HDTV or PC monitor that has DVI interface and not HDMI. Its well crafted and the price is unmatched anywhere else on the web. Even if anything were to happen to it; at this price I would buy two more as back ups. Everyone that sees my PS3 in action with this cable immedialtey just assumes its an HDMI picture.
4,Excellent Alternatives To TV,"The games in this book offer parents excellent alternatives to TV. For the child, it really depends on whether they are interested in any particular game. Some of them may work for your child, some of them won't. Many of these games are also quite familiar to parents or the kids may already be playing them in nursery school or kindergarten. I'm sure everyone has already played the coin rubbing or tracing game with his kid.The book may not score points for originality, but as a guide for parents who may not be able to think up so many games offhand, it is still a valuable reference book. I especially like the which floats and which sinks game."
5,Good product,"What's there to say about an ionizing wire? Hmmm, it was exactly what we ordered? It keeps our air cleaner functioning like a charm? Yes, yes it did. We did order two; good thing, because we broke the end off the first one. Doesn't come with instructions (you have to be smart enough to know what you're doing to order it in the first place I suppose). So, if you're in the market for a replacement ionizing wire, this is the deal for you."
3,What Is Wrong With Feminism?,"Why are feminist so obsessed with men? I thought they didn't give a rat's a** about men!Another feminist wrote how, ""men are fascinated with toys"". Well, what about feminist being ""fascinated"" with men? So what does that say about them???And still, another feminist wrote, ""women need men like a fish needs a bicycle"". Actually, the real problem more correctly stated is, women trying to live WITHOUT the need of men is like a fish trying to RIDE a bicycle.Fer cry'n out loud...... GET MARRIED!!! HAVE CHILDREN!!! Heck, play with the toys while were gone! Ride a bike with flippers! Who cares??? Just don't mess with my stereo or wreck my car."
1,Self-absorbed nonsense,"OK, we get it, she's clever.However, Dowd is extremely superficial in her treatise on whether or not men are necessary. Maybe in her conception of feminism (which is that of ""Me Generation"" Baby-boomer trash), give-and-take is impossible within the confines of a relationship.It is possible for a ultra-successful woman to be happy in a relationship (in fact, it is likely) with a man, provided that the woman is not a self-absorbed harpy like Dowd. The reality is that a relationship is an entity in and of itself that must be given constant consideration -- this is hard to do when either partner only looks out for number one.Gee, it is a wonder that no one has snatched that lil' lady right up and married her, huh? I checked this one out of the library. . .I didn't think I wanted to commit to Dowd by purchasing her book. . .kind of a theme, eh?"
2,The downside of feminism...,"The successful, intelligent, 55-year-old Dowd can't figure out why no man wants to marry her.Memo to Maureen: Men propose when they want to have families. If they don't want kids, they prefer having a girlfriend. Girlfriends can't cash out, so they're nicer to be with."
1,Wow! Who knew?,"It never fails to amuse me when liberals discover something that the rest of humanity has known for centuries. Remember when liberals discovered sex in the sixties? Wow! Who knew? Likewise, our girl Maureen has discovered that relationships between the sexes are difficult and strained. Wow! Who knew? Well, over the centuries humanity and religion have developed marriage and a set of moral standards to help men and women find ways to love each other and respect each other and live happily with each other. Anyone genuinely following this guidance will live a happy life.Who knows, in a few years I expect that a bright liberal flame over at the NYT op/ed section will discover that the world is ROUND! Wow! Who knew?"
2,Ms. Dowd should stick to being a columnist,This book is more about women vs. women and what a feminist is or should be vs a book about men and women. The title is totally misleading as is the cover illustration. I was looking forward to a fun lighhearted read about the ongoing battle of the sexes. Men who are offended by the title of this book will be pleased to know that Ms. Dowd spends more time attacking women than men. It doesn't seem like Ms. Dowd could make up her mind what she wanted to accomplish with this book. At times it is fun and light hearted but turn the page and she's making unsupported arguments of a more serious nature. It doesn't work for this book. Either make it fun or make it serious. And please will someone burn Ms. Dowd's thesaurus?If you are not a fan of Ms. Dowd this is probably not the book for you. This was a painful read but I kept at it hoping this book would eventually redeem itself. No such luck. Can I have my money back?
2,"An entertaining read, but no substance","I read few of Dowd's columns, but I enjoyed reading them. They are witty and insightful. I expected to be entertained, but also educated. I thought I'd get a substantive, albeit tongue-in-cheek, analysis of feminism, women's progress, etc. This is a great disappointment. Not only is the book not substantive, it's sloppy. The book came out a couple of months ago, yet Dowd mentions events that happened in the middle of this year. This means she slapped the book together in a month or two, and it shows. That's unfortunate, because she squandered an opportunity to write a great book."
5,eddy,"these heads only last for a year or two, and you have to buy another one. all in all buy a differant brand printer next time. I have had four differant canon printers."
1,This book sucks,"This is the worst book I have ever read. Its high price is ridiculous.I can hardly imagine how this kind of trash book can be published.It is a big humiliation to the reader's intelligence. It is a shameto our human culture for how many trees and paper are wasted for printingthis useless, awful and sick book."
3,Silly Morals,This book has beautiful pictures. The situations are ones that kids can relate to - and offer an opportunity for kids to learn some appropriate behaviors in difficult situations. Then they follow it up with a moral that is pointless. I am disappointed in the book.
5,Courageous book,"In a time when so many authors simply whine about injustice, Raybon does something about it. But what she does isn't the usual attack-the-bad-guy stuff. Instead, she does something much more courageous: she forgives the bad guy. This is a book of encouragement, of hope, of rare character from someone who would have every right to seek revenge. Raybon has written a book that dares us all to look inside ourselves and to God in our quest for harmony with one another."
1,"""STEAMER"" is the incorrect word to describe these!","WARNING: These are NOT steamers. The manufacturer's box does not refer to them as steamers, and unless you steam things IN water rather than ABOVE water (using an insert that these don't have), these cannot be used as steamers. Further, Customer Service has assured me the description of this item will be changed (I don't know when) to stop misleading the customers. 5 stars for customer service, zero for these little storage/microwave warm-up containers."
1,If you can get it in Once piece,I'm sure the product is great if you can get them to send you one that isn't broken! I had to return the item 3 times and everytime i got a broken one back. If you looking for reliability or a nice gift for someone this vendor is not the one to go to
1,A case for the no-stars or negative-stars option,"I don't usually write DVD reviews, but this is THE WORST movie I have ever had the displeasure of watching. I can't get my time or money back, but maybe I can save someone else from wasting theirs by writing this review. This sucks: plot, acting, production values, the whole nine yards. Run. Run very far away from this tired flick."
5,Diamond Blade sharpener,"Self contained inside the handle locks to open position and offers Course sharpening for the blades with nicks in them and on the other side is the Fine blade sharpener for a Razor sharp blade. The design allows the metal shavings to fall off the stone, you need no oil for sharpening this is an easy fast excellent blade dressing kit."
5,Love this music......,"When I saw the movie, the music added something more to it...and I believe without it, the movie wouldn't be as entertaining."
4,Way too expensive,GOG.com just offered this game via download with zero DRM for $9.99. Makes it hard for Amazon.com to keep up.
4,"Very entertaining game, despite its age.","I experienced an apparently common (but disabling) glitch when attempting to first load the software (September 2006), but it was quickly resolved (~24 hours) by Atari's support department. The single player game has an engaging story line and the community content allows for endless game play. One could waste away in front of the computer playing it! The graphics, while certainly dated, reward users with more modern video cards with rich environments. I first played this game back in 2003 and the interface felt flat - somewhat bland. Now, with a newer vid card, it is like an almost-new game!In this age of ""more is better,"" NWN continues to provide refreshing, casual enjoyment that may be had during a 15-minute session or a 15-hour session. If you opt for the latter, be sure to keep a large glass of water and some eye drops handy!"
4,Slight dissapointment,"I purchased this game hoping to play it as soon as I got it, but as luck would have it there were no CD keys for the game in the box. The page was there in the manual it was just blank. So it took we over a week of playing e-tag with Atari before I could play :( Otherwise it's been great"
5,"A great game, but GOG has it for $9.99","I won't bother adding to the praise for this game; I'm just posting this to say that, as of today, you can get the NWN Diamond Edition at [...] in a completely DRM-free, fully patched digital download version for only $9.99. This will be the definitive version from here on out, so don't waste your money buying it here."
4,Very Satisfied,Very satisfied with the product and the seller. Game was bought for my son and he has enjoyed it very much . Thank you.Neverwinter Nights Diamond
3,"Bought from amazon, cd keys still messed up","Hey guess what all you guys saying ""Buy the game from Amazon, the cd keys are good if you buy it through them"". I DID buy it from Amazon directly and HEY it has the same 3 same cd key problems other people have. And this just happened recently, so stop saying that Amazon has the ""good working"" copies when they don't!!!I just wanted to clear this up since everyone is saying ""Go through Amazon and get a good copy"" when they are lieing."
2,Great game - BAD DISTRIBUTION!,"This is a great game for RPG fans. But, due to a manufacturing error, these $20 Diamond packs DO NOT COME WITH CD KEYS.This means you have to email tech support, send in photos, and wait several days to get your keys.Buy this somewhere else."
5,A great pocket guide to Caribbean Seashores,This is an ideal book for beachcombers with an interest in natural history or for marine biology students on a Caribbean field trip. It is a bit more than your standard identification guide as it has substantial sections of natural history. Kaplan was the founder and director of the Hofstra University Marine Lab for many years and this book reflects his decades of fisled experience and enthusiasm for teaching marine biology in the field.
2,"""Aliens have landed"" whisting tea kettle","I do not recommend this tea kettle for 2 reasons:1. It has a strange, low pitched whistle that sounds like an alien ship landing rather than a pleasant high whistle. It's so low, that I don't even know when it's whistling, except that I hear this annoying ""wee-oo wee-oo wee-oo"" sound that makes me get up to stop that crazy sound.2. When you open the spout, a spurt of hot water comes shooting out, which has burned me twice now.Anyway, the one good thing is that it heats water to a very hot temperature and it looks nice sitting on the stove (the roosters are tasteful). We call it the Alien Tea Kettle at home."
3,Medium flame ONLY.,Only medium flame because of the structure of this kettle. Anything higher will cause the kettle to break.The teakettle is stylish and adds a country feeling to your home.
1,Contemporary Native American singer bashes this book,"The boarding school system this book is about was one of the darkest, ugliest moments in the history of US/American Indian relations. Rinaldi's work glosses over this in the worst ways. Native Americans across the US and Canada are aware of this book. In 2000, a Kickapoo singer wrote and recorded a song based on the criticism of the book. To hear the song and read the lyrics, go to her website. Her name is Arigon Starr and click on Audio/Lyrics. The song is listed there. A critical review of the book was published at the Oyate website, and in leading educator's journals such as Multicultural Review, Multicultural Literature, and Rethinking Schools."
3,"Many entries, all rather superficial","The book contains many entries, but lacks in my opinion a more in-depth analysis. With more illustrations it could be a nice children's book..."
2,"These arrived quickly, but I was really burned on the price...","I needed these Red Hots for a recipe for my grandchildren at Christmas. The seven ounce bag sounded like it was very large, but when it arrived it it was very small. The price was exhorbitant, so much so that I learned to go to a convenience store for the small boxes next time. I did this to save money, but instead I got stuck."
3,For the price....ok,slow response time that will throw off power users. wheel clicks when used and jerks into place. floats a bit when moved. plug andd play in XP with no restart needed. about the right price at 7 bucks. your basic mouse at a basic price.
3,Tootle software,"Our family was excited about receiving this product, but were rather disappointed with it upon its arrival. The story of ""Tootle"" was read with the same two repeating sound effects- very monotonous. The games are limited in their ability to challenge our 4 year old. He has a love of trains, and Tootle, so he does continue to ask to play this game. He would rate it higher than the grownups of the house!"
1,Opinion,"I found the book informative in the first few pages and in the little sections that contained more info on certain subjects. I found the spells to be completely crappy. I can not believe that information on spellcraft didn't include info on the traditonal tools, or even contain spells that used some traditonal tools. I hated it!!"
4,Full look,needed something for a Wearable Art Show piece that gave a full look to my wearable design without making it bulky. This was perfect!!!
2,Disappointing,"I don't know if the particular product I got was flawed, or if it was as designed, but the photograph has a clear image of three concentric circles all moving outward from the body. What I got was a skirt with one small circle and two of the same size below it. It looked like a victorian bustle, except instead of positioning on my rear, it was all around me, just making me look oddly shaped.I've never used it, and when I contacted the seller to attempt a return, I never heard back."
1,out dated,"The short and sweet: breaks easily, lots of compatability issues, buggy software, nonexistent support, overpriced and ugly. If the compact flash hadn't fallen out due to poor design and broken I would have returned it!"
5,Revealing of God,"This book is yet another one that reveals God in a close, intense, special, intimate, riveting way. I am so happy to have this easy read. Many people I know also give this book high reviews for how such a little book could change a whole life. Indeed God was working through Gibson on this one. It is a book I would recommend for Christians and non-Christians alike. Do you have an interest in God? Do you wonder how he feels about you? Do you know who and how he really is? Check this book out....its a life changer for sure."
2,not wearing as expected,"I have had this set for 1.5 yrs now. I loved it when I got it as a Christmas gift. Unfortunately, all of the pieces now are covered in silverware marks from everyday use. I have tried the Pfaltzgraff cleaner to no avail. I have also tried to email Pflatzgraff directly with no respone. The set is now so bad I am going to have to replace it and try another brand. Overall, I am totally disapointed!! The set is beautiful but not worth the money."
5,Excellent purchase,I am so pleased with these spoons. Excellent quality and feel. Love that they are dishwasher safe as well. Love them!
1,RUSTING!,I had these a little over a week when the black patina (or paint??) on the handles started to come off... then the handles started to rust. We have other flatware by Gourmet Settings (Treble Clef design) and this has never happened with those.
5,Great CD!,"This is one of my all-time favorite CDs. It combines what teenagers go through every day with a mature - and beautiful - voice. What's more, Jessica's an amazing person..."
5,AWESOME,wow--so i listened to her song on the 10 things i hate about you soundtrack and never expected that her cd would be this good. its great and i really recommend it!
5,"at risk, by patricia cornwall","in perfect condition, not her besr work but entertaining just the same. the book came as promised and promptly. thank you."
1,Very Disappointing !!,"I'm a big Patricia Cornwall fan, but I was very disappointed in this book. Besides the fact that it is very short (the first thing you notice is the double-spacing), there was very little plot or character development, and it was mostly just very dull. Don't waste your money or what little time it takes to read it."
2,At Risk is shallow,"From someone who loves Kay Scarpetta and the depth Patricia Cornwell puts into those novels, At Risk was a huge disappointment. I think the characters have depth potential that is never explored, but you feel as though you've been dropped in the middle of the story with little to no background or meaning behind what the characters do, feel or say. You feel as though you're dangling; you feel as though it was rushed. Not a typical Cornwell."
1,Too bad...,"Patricia Cornwell's early work was top-notch, but most everything she's written lately has been sloppy, disjointed and feels like something she did while she was busy thinking about something else. I was hoping this one would be different since it was written as a series of magazine serials. But, this one was even worse.This book has so many plot holes and barely introduced characters that flit in and flit out again that it feels like the work of an amateur rather than the work of an author of more than 20 books. The main characters are just sketches, rather than being fleshed out. Is she such a commodity that her editors can't edit her any more?"
1,Not worth the price!,"With the exception of ""Preditor"", I have read and enjoyed read Cornwell's books. This books was boring and uninteresting.I purchased the paperback and paid a normal price. However, the print was larger then a normal book and contained more blank pages. If, the print was small like other books and didn't have the blank pages, instead of 289 pages, it would be about 189 pages.I'm just glad I didn't pay for a hardcover version."
1,Where are the other 10 parts to the book,"Well, it states on the dustjacket that this is the result from a 15 part story that she wrote. After reading this I am starting to think it was supposed to be 25 parts and the other 10 got lost. This book lacks character depth and a stable story line. She jumps all over the place and makes incredible leaps of logic that would stump a member of Mensa. The first three quarters of the book are decent (though not up to her standard) but the last part of the book is at best a haphazard attempt at wrapping everything up in as few pages as possible.I am thoroughly disappointed in this book."
1,Readers At Risk Of Going Awol,"I have been an avid fan and collector for years of everything Cornwell. This new offering is disappointing because we have been treated to such good writing in all of her other books. When you have had the best anything less does not satisfy . The book was too short,too predictable,and did not seem like it was written by Patricia Cornwell . Although I consider myself a loyal fan I can not give this book a good review. Readers deserve better . Please ,bring back Scarpetta ."
2,disjointed and disappointing,"This was my first Patricia Cornwell read and quite a disappointing experience. I disliked the style of writing (first person, present tense), found the lack of personal pronouns irritating, and the short, choppy dialogue came across as unnatural. The scene changes were jarring and there was little to no suspense, contrary to the back cover blurb. With very little character development, I cared nothing for any of them. The story reads as though little effort went into creating it."
3,"Past or present, murder & mayhem...","Past or present, murder & mayhem...Meet Monique, a self-absorbed ambitious DA with visions of being the governor of MA. Meet Winston, her lead investigator who does not like being led by the nose. Meet Sykes, the middle aged TBI investigator whose help is priceless to Win. Cornwell takes a 20year old murder in Knoxville TN, a modern day conspiracy, and a cast of characters on an uneven ride in this tale. Not one or her best works although the characters are good, but tend to waffle. Her story seems to be cut off at the knees in its abrupt ending. There is potential for a good series if she sticks to a more unified theme the next time.Keep in mind that this is a murder/mayhem read. 3.5* of 5*"
1,By Far Not Her Best Work....,"This book falls in line with the ""Southern Cross"" series that Cornwell attempted several years back. Although, it was entertaining, it lacked her usual suspense and page turning qualities. I'm sure that everyone would agree that most Cornwell readers have been spoiled with her ""Scarpetta"" series & unfortunately just about anything else is not up to par. Not a ""new book"" purchase to rush right out and buy -- wait and buy this one used..."
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!,"I have been a Patricia Cornwell fan for years and have read all of the Scarpetta series and loved them. This book ""At Risk"" is a HUGE disappointment! The characters are unlikable and shallow, the plot is superficial and very forgettable. I hope Cornwell doesn't plan to make these characters into a series -- they aren't worth the paper it's printed on! Patricia Cornwell, go back to the drawing board and try again. Sorry, but ""At Risk"" is a loser!"
1,In a word... Lousy,"I cannot believe this book was written by Patricia Cornwell. While she's not my favorite author (Tess Gerritsen gets that nod for mysteries), she is certainly far better than this book would lead one to believe. It's a good thing this isn't the first work I've read by her, or I would never have read another one. While I agree that the Scarpetta novels are getting old, especially since Lucy become a main character, this certainly wasn't the way to go to introduce us to a new cast. Very few of the characters were particularly likable, and the run-on sentences got very old very quickly. Come on, Patricia. You can do better than this."
1,Not worth it!,"I was very disappointed in this book. I had to force myself to finish it and I usually like Cornwell. Sure am glad I didn't PAY for it (library). The characters are poorly developed, the plot is confusing and disjointed, and the overall story is unimpressive. Don't waste your time."
3,Not what I expected,"Cornwall seems to have pushed this book through with little effort. As a long time reader of all of her works, I was let down by this recent edition."
3,"I haven't read the book yet, but have read all the reviews....","I think I'm going to go check it out at the library, just because I am a Patricia Cornwall fan....I've read them all. ALL THAT REMAINS is my personal favorite....I really hope the next one has better reviews!!! I don't think she's had a really good book since BLOW FLY (my 2nd favorite)!Enjoy!!"
4,Wonderful Book,Im not that big of a reader but i liked it. I picked it up as something to read on the plane and i continued with it after my trip. I would suggest this but to anyone who enjoys these topics. It is an easy to read and understand book.
1,Not even one star,"I hated to give this book even one star. It was terrible. I have read all the Patricia Cornwell books and they have been steadily going down hill for the last 2 or 3. I think with this one she hit rock bottom--I hope. There is nowhere to go but up! The plot was confusing, the writing technique annoying (truncated dialogue with no pronouns) and the characters so poorly delineated that I couldn't even keep them straight. Sorry to say I will have to cross Cornwell off of my ""must read"" list."
1,Where is the outstanding writer we once knew?,"This book must have been written simply to fulfill an production obligation to her publisher. It is a thin book with larger print, a weak story line, and stuffed with useless and detailed descriptions of anything and everything.If you browse over the ""filler"" descriptions, you can read this book in several hours. And afterwards, you'll ask yourself ""why?""""At Risk"" is unrelated to the Scarpetta series, which in the last few books has losing substance as well.Cornwell has been one of my favorite authors for years and I am so disappointed in her recent novels."
2,Disappointed with this book,"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell books and love them all. Except this one. I just liked it. It was okay. Not what I've come to expect from one of my favorite authors. I was excited to see that there were new characters and I did enjoy them - as much as there was to know about them. However the whole story did not develop very well, and it left me feeling like I missed a whole bunch of the 'potential' story. I ended the book feeling like Ms. Cornwell was trying to make a statement to someone with this book rather than telling a story. Very disappointed."
1,Not what I expect from PC,"I love Patrica Cornwell's writing. However, At Risk was bland. There were a couple of memorable sentences but it lacked her usual sparkle. I really liked Win, would like to see him be developed, didn't like Lamont and never actually understood the plot tie-in to the story. Loved the Grandmom, and after having move to Boston a few years ago it's fun to say. Oh the red line to Harvard Square. I've been there. That part of the book was nice as was the playing with Win's social awkwardness in acquisition of the finer things in life as a second hand rose. I relate to that, and I see it as a unique understanding of the New England outsider's path. I'm sure that there was a conclusion Just can't remember it. I was too focused at the end on finishing the darn thing and passing it off to one of my friends, just to get it out of my library. Give Win and Skyes a second chance. Lose that pig Lamont as fast as you can and stay the hell out of Tennessee."
5,Smart Money,"Excellent book with practical, easy to follow advice minus the financial jargon. Mr. Ferri explains financial concepts in a simple, straightforward style and walks the reader through steps to develop a sound, well thought out financial plan. I'd highly recommend this book!"
3,ok item,Wish we could have listened to the CD before purchased probably would not have ordered it not as good as his others but we will play it now and then.
4,Quick read,"I found this book to be a real page-turner. The story went at a quick pace and was very entertaining. There was a twist in this story that some have complained about. I found the direction that the story went in to be surprising and different and this made it refreshing. In any event reading this book is a must after the first two and considering that it isn't a challenging read, you really won't be wasting your time."
2,Finale ruins the trilogy,"This was nurdling on along just fine as another Hickman and Weis fantasy trilogy; nothing out of the ordinary, but perfectly readable.Then you get to the end of this book, and it all completely falls apart. Boy, but did they ever ruin things here. Sigh."
4,"Very good, but had it's faults.","It was good in most ways. The characters were very good, and the first thing I always look for in a book is good characters. The story was good except I resent it running like a science fiction novel. There were some really deep ideas in it, but at other times it could be light and funny. I thought the ending was really good except that it was not explained thoughly enough and was rather confusing to be the last book in the series.It was very origanal from other fantasy books I have read. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good fantasy book to read because I could not put it down."
3,"Buy it used....bottom line focused, pragmatic, more money for Jack....","My guess is that Jack's last question on his last day will be ""Was I a good manager?""There is a quote that this is the only business book that you need to read. That's true if you've not read any of Jack's other books; there's not much new here. If you want an overview of HR, strategic planning, management, etc. for public companies you should spend a couple of hours to flip through this. As others have stated,it's an overview of management, but it's certainly not new material and it's not insightful or thorough enough to be a true reference; Cliff Notes...just the facts. It's about how Jack did it, and it always seems as though he's telling you about Jack but yet looking for validation.It would be helpful to compare current GE practices to Welch-era practices to see which have stuck and which changed from a best practice prespective. This will not be a timeless management reference text."
1,Not to be taken Seriously,"Jack Welch I am sure was a good manager, but throughout the book he talks about the importance of loyalty, honesty and integrity. This is from a guy who has admitted cheating on his wife. It seems Jack falls into the category of do as I say--not as I do. I am sorry I bought this book. It is really preachy, but the author needs to follow his own advice and come down from the mountain."
1,"EWW, is this what business is really like?","If this is what it takes to ""WIN"" then we are all in big trouble. Thank goodness I bought this used. I guess you have to be part of the business cult to get why being arrogant and greedy is a good thing. I will be burning this one and after seeing this guy on Colbert Report the other night it just proved to be that even the ""best"" CEO's are cruel and heartless. NO THANKS, I will stay with my simple mom & pop and forgo the fortune."
5,Winning,"This is a ""must read"" leadership book. I listened to Jack tell the story which was very fun and his passion shined through all of the many techniques and stories he shares. After listening to it I decided to purchase the book also so that I could reference all of the great leadership techniques and adopt them into my current leadership position!"
1,a book for sheep that can read,"Jack Welch represents a change in corporate tactics that have lead to things like absurd CEO pay, private jets, outsourcing, and 80 hour work weeks. Folks that rated this book five stars need to take a serious look at their own lives."
5,Great Advice From A Highly Successful And Experienced CEO,The writing style is excellent: simple and straight to the point. It's full of great advice from the icon of CEOs in the 80s and the 90s. Highly recommended!
4,Compete to WIN,Vendor shipping was accurate to what was stated. Book came in great condition. The book has great advice for all business professionals seeking to work in management.
5,Great Book on Leadership!,Jack Welch knows how to make a company successful. One important lesson I learnt from this book is the importance of candor in an organisation.If you're in business or a team leader this is a must read!
3,"Maybe I'm just too cynical, but...","My first impression was that this was just another feel good, motivational book. But once I got into the book I quickly found out that I was right.I hate to give any book a bad review, but I have read so many of these motivational books and they are all the same. this one was no different. They leave you motivated for a little while but leave you with very litte practical knowledge. However, I can't completely recommend against this book as it may be of great benefit to many people. I'm probably just a little too jaded for Winning."
4,"good book, not what i expected","the book is mainly a storytelling of mr welchs life and times. i do enjoy hearing the perspective of wildly successful people but don't be misguided to think this is a self help or how to. Nonetheless, those shortcomings should not discount the value of the book. It stands on its own merit and is a worthwhile read."
1,A preachy book,"This is a preachy book that truely reflect GE's culture - Preachy.Other than that, I really don't care about the moral issues around him. I tried very hard to find the ""intelligent"" stuff in this book. I found none.Let me quote reviews from another reader:""If you're looking for substance here - you won't find the wisdom or motivation for achieving greatness you might be thinking you'll find. "" Period."
5,"Excellent! Required reading material at my company, Esenai Corporation","This was an excellent book that I use as a guide for running my consulting business. I especially like the chapters on candor, how to hire folks and budgets. In general, the book has reaffirmed some ideas that I had in mind and has given me new ones that I should implement.This should be required reading material for anyone who wants to have or be a part of a successful organization!"
4,Good Review of the Topic,"I began reading, hoping to find an inexpensive wind project that I could build myself. This was the wrong book for that idea. It covers the subject in a very matter-of-fact way, on more of a ""commercial"" level but it helped me get a much better grip on reality. While we have a good site for wind power generation, I determined that it would not be cost-effective for us to develop a project of significant size."
1,Bad quality,"I do not recommend this product, the fabric arrived torned ... Bad quality of the favric, my son should use only one time ...."
5,A tribute to Sid Meier's game,"I bought Centauri Dawn yesterday, and I enjoyed it a lot! I stayed up until I was done reading it. I have to admit, every time I played the Alpha Centauri game, I wondered how it would look like for ""real"", and this book, I think, has brought that image into my mind like I always expected it would be. Although it might be a tad more easy to understand things that occur in the book if you have played the game, it's still an excellent book! I recommend buying it!"
5,Great activity for all ages!,"I bought one of these for myself (just for fun) but the two wheels were quickly taken over by my 6 and 9 year old kids. There is only one set of four motions required to make all the brackets (the pattern is set by the initial ordering of the threads, and the wheels are color-coded to help you set up 4 different, very cute patterns: hearts, flowers, diamonds, and a four color barber-pole stripe) With a little tutoring even my 6-year old was able to produce bracelets as long as I was there to provide the occasional reminder. The bracelets take a while to produce so the child you purchase this for should have a good attention span, but the end product is very nice. I'm buying one for my little girl's friend. I hope she likes it as well as my kids do. Now I just need to get another for me!"
4,Friendship Bracelet Expanded,Alex Friend 2 Friend is an expansion on the friendship bracelets...the wheels make patterns as the floss directions are followed. Beautiful designs and rounded bracelets versus the flat bracelets are produced. Kids from ages 8-88 love this product.
2,Feelin' so Let Down,"The long awaited Chicago biography has proved to be a big dissapointment. Any Chicago fan (and I am a big one, all the way back to the beginning), would be familiar with much of the information within, most of which can be found on the numerous Chicago web sites. Very little background about the tours, song constructions and band members anecdotes are to be found. You never really get to find out what makes this band tick, what are their likes and dislikes. Using the albums to take us through Chicago's career is a good idea, but too much space has been wasted on telling us the band members and tracks plus a few lines of song lyrics for each album. This book is very much like that of the band themselves over the past twenty years with a few exceptions........not bad, but could try harder. It's the fans that pay the wages, please give them what they want."
1,Complete Crud,"This book is an absolute joke. There are so many misspellings and grammar errors - the photos are completely low budget and cheezy black & white xeroxes - the band did not contribute any info or interviews - the majority of info came from road technicians - which isn't such a bad thing because I respect and love both Kiki Ebsen and Bobby Ludwig - it just seems odd that instead of interviewing the band Chicago and their current and past band members, the ""author"" interviews their crew. I also wonder what is Ben Joseph's real name because I don't take this guy's credentials very seriously. This book proves ANYONE can put out a book, sell it and sit back and call yourself an author. The book cover is nice and colorful but everything else about this book sucks the giant cosmic weenie. With lots of love, poodle puppies and fuzzy giggles, dawaynebailey.com"
3,One Size Fits All did not fit me,"If you have a big head, this is not the hat for you.I have a big head, and this hat was too small (yes I bought the large size).I gave it a 3 and not a 1 because it appears to be well constructed."
4,A snapshot of its time,"This movie is certainly a product of its era. It was fun to watch as a movie, and even more fun to look at and think about how times have changed and how they haven't. Much better filmmaking than Easy Rider, but the plot is no more developed."
1,Broken after 10-month usage,I bought this product last July to ground food for my infant son. It's already broken last month after less a year of usage. The motor stopped working completely. I'm shocked at the low quality of this product. I'll not recommend buying it if you are looking for something more durable.
2,surprised,"I gave this to a lovely person for her to make baby food, but she is not going to use it because it does not have an ""on and off"" button. As soon as you plug it in, it starts chopping.NOT GOOD."
4,Love this kidco Mill,"I love this product! It's really easy to use. It does pure the food very well. If the food is to chunky for your baby just add water,milk and the you go! My baby is 8 months old and this is how we do it."
4,Great Baby Mill!,"I was so pleasantly surprised by this baby mill! Here's some reasons why I love it:* It's small enough I keep it right on my countertop to blend up any fruits, veggies, or meals we're having.* The two cup bowl, blades and lid are all dishwasher safe!* It is so easy to use! Just place the lid on, lock it in place, put the motor on top and press down. You can pulse the food or keep pressing down to the desired consistency you'd like.* The price is pretty hard to beat, particularly since other more expensive baby mills don't seem to do as great a job.I really love this baby mill and am so glad I purchased it!"
4,Leader of the women's movement,"Zsuzsanna comes from a heritage that not only respects women, but is composed of women celebrating the rites of passage at every stage of life. It's about women supporting women. She has opened many roads to the idea of a very organic way of life. Love her books, love her philosophy. This book is spiritual, but not religious, if you understand the difference, which is what attracted me."
4,'Le Sacre Review #2/Inbal-Philharmonia (Teldec): Pretty 'Oke,"Teldec's recording balance, and the playing of the Philharmonia, and the stars here. Inbal is a little slower than most, and though this is not a problem,this is, neither, the most high octane reading. Inbal seems to believe this is just a musical score, whereas, in reality, isn't it so much more?Instruments are highlighted nicely, and the whole orchestra congeals well, though, I almost get a hint of politeness in spots (where I shouldn't). Ultimately, it's a pretty flat recording, in the good sense. This is certainly a vast improvement over the other Teldec 'Le Sacre' by Mehta (there is also a THIRD! with Barenboim). This is still an orchestra playing music, and not a religious experience.I give it between 3.5 and 3.75 stars. It makes a good compare."
4,Conservatives Without Conscience,"This book is one of the first voices that deplores the way conservative values of Sen. Barry Goldwater are being used by the Republican Party and Christian Right. Sen Goldwater had intended to write the book with Mr. Dean. The way the conservative message is being voiced today has little to do with the values Sen Goldwater and a joung Mr. Dean understood them to be. There was to be less government not more; fiscal responsiblity and an end to pork barrel projects not an inflation beyond belief.Just as Mr. Dean was the conscience in the White House in the early months of Watergate, he continues to be able to see the consequences in the long term of decisions being made now. If this book has been written by a Democrat or member of the left it could easily be dismissed. Coming from Mr. Dean it is a book all concerned Americans should read."
1,John Dean is NOT CONSERVATIVE...,"...he is a bitter, old man. He turned against his party to save his own neck during Watergate. He was deeper involved in the breakin and coverup that Nixon was - but he flipped to witness for the prosecution to avoid going to jail. Where he would probably still be...should be."
2,A Crook Writing About Crooks,"I can't stand George W. Bush. Dean gets kudos for raising issues about the modern Republican party.But who can trust a book written about criminals, when the author himself was involved in a Washington scandal in the 1960s? Not this fella."
3,Stopped short,"Dean comes close in some ways at really getting at the root of the problem we face as a people - that individuals that lack a conscience in any form have taken control of the US government and its people. Dean uses the research of a social psychologist, Bob Altemeyer, to explain the traits of these individuals - authoritarians or people that have social dominance orientation, but stops short of what we are really dealing with - sociopaths or psychopaths. These sociopaths or psychopaths don't care about you or me. They don't have a conscience or an ability to empathize for others. They care about keeping control and power. I read John Dean's book right after I read the book 'Political Ponerology' by Andrew Lobaczewski, which a reader of 'Conservatives Without Conscience' will find worth reading to understand how psychological deviants take control and keep it. A reader may also want to read 'Snakes in Suits' by Robert Hare to better grasp the situation."
4,a conservative perspective on conservatives without conscience,"well once again, we learn things about people in power that we would rather not know because it makes one feel so lied to, so angry that our lives are ofton in their hands in government. and this is not good for high blood pressure, but I am really thankful that there are people who will tell the truth, that there are even Republicans who have some integrity."
2,He Is My Brother,I like the story but the video picture is too dark. I can hardly see the movie. It's very poor for what I payed for. I will probably never purchase anything from them again.Pam Douglas
1,Why?,"When I first got this book, I thought to myself, ""Cool, this is gonna really help me."" As I read further into the book, I realized that there are many spelling errors and mistakes, some of them very obvious. It seems that many things were assumed and not checked when the book was written. This was not what I wanted, and I should of looked elsewhere to find better information on this game."
1,Do not buy this microwave,"I owned one for approximately 15 months when the magnetron tube failed. Since it was an ""undercounter"" installation, it wasn't easy to remove and take in for service. GE wanted $119.95 for a service call plus labor - the magnetron tube was the only thing that was warranted. Total cost of the service call was estimated at $150-180 while a new one was $200.GE has finally succeeded at creating a disposable microwave - I guess disposable refrigerators are next"
1,Do Not Buy---Junk,"I will not buy another GE product. This product required replacement of a main component ($250) within 2 years of new. I repaired it even though it cost 3/4 the price of a new machine---because I guess I am an idiot that (1) believed GE to be a ""good"" brand and this was a fluke, (2) I was not raised to buy into the ""throwaway"" culture.It began malfunctioning again within a year. The thing acted possessed by a demon, i.e. it would complete a cycle, then when the food was removed and the door closed, would start running again by itself. This was only one of several erratic behaviors. It would have to be unplugged, then plugged in again to reset itself.Appliances used to last, especially name brands. GE should be ashamed of themselves for producing this kind of disposable trash."
4,"Oh, I wish . . .","I won't refute anything anyone else has said in praise of this performance-- it is thoroughly enjoyable, especially for those who love ""the flexible tiger"" and the other whimisical delights of the English version.BUT--I do wish that there had been another soprano, and another bass/baritone on hand to sing the Adam and Eve. In this performance, Michael George and Emma Kirkby each sing the roles of the angels Raphael and Gabriel (respectively), then Adam and Eve. A clear contrast of vocal colors between the angelic and earthly characters seems called for, and greatly enhances the work."
5,Review of the quest for Kim,"Quest for Kim is a superb book looking at Rudyard Kiplings Kim and the world Kim lived in. It goes into the story and compares the places and possible characters in the book to the real life counterparts. As you read each page you are carried to the world of kim past and present and want to keep turning the pages. Peter Hopkirk is one of the best writers and can be enjoyed by all. A fine book,I'm looking forward to making my next purchase from amazon.Stephen."
3,Surprise!,"This was a book my Dad loved. He'd often talk about it and laugh. He passed away in 1984. The other day I got the book off of my mom's shelves and decided to read it. It begins with interesting fateful circumstances, carries you along through the middle wondering where it is going to lead, and ends with a surprise. And I'm not easy to surprise.Read it with curiosity and have fun!"
5,Dr. Eckstein Lavolind,"I was first introduced to this skin care line when I was stationed in Italy. I had so many skin problems so I used to go for regular facials. The dermatologist used to give me samples of this stuff but of course I always treated the samples like a gimmic to buy. On the other hand, I loved the way it left my face soft, clean and fresh looking.I'm in my 30's and hated to say that I was plagued w/ adult acne and other issues. But this stuff was amazing! I don't even have to wear make-up. An extremely natural product. Also, a little goes a long way. One bottle will last me months, so even though it is a little pricey, I buy 2 bottles every six months or so."
5,Great Pot,"I use this pot whenever I need to make large quantities of meals for myself. It's just the right size and is very heavy-duty. I've used it several times, it fits in my dishwasher and looks just as good as it did when I got it. Highly recommened for those of us who cook a lot."
1,Not a good product...,I am extremly unhappy with this product. After only using it for 2 weeks the pump spout fell off. I managed to put it back in place but it continues to fall off. Its a good looking piece but not well made.
3,looks good but can fall apart,The spout on this is hard to tighten onto the base and sometimes the tip comes off. it otherwise does its job
2,Shmaybe...,"Okay - chock full o' instructions. Some nice pictures - but some pretty goofy stretches for sand projects. Recipe guides, equipment lists, yada yada.Nice try... but not something I think would be much fun for adults, and too geeky for the kids."
3,Sandcastles,"After enjoying a similar book for snow sculptures, I have to admit that I thought this book didn't match up to its counterpart. The examples presented here seem to be lacking something in both quality and quantity. Overall I'd say that this book does not seem to be sufficiently ""kid-friendly."""
5,This is the best CD remastering job yet...buy this now!!!,"If you're a diehard Thin Lizzy/Phil Lynott fan who's been waiting for the ultimate CD remastering of the Thin Lizzy classics, this is the compilation to get. Spend the money, or try to find it used. I've been listening to this band and some of these tracks for over thirty years, and after listening to this remastering job, it's almost like I'm hearing some of these tracks for the first time. The remastering engineer should get a Grammy nomination. I'm not exaggerating...buy this now, end of story."
1,Thoroughly disappointed,"I thought I was a Thin Lizzy fan after listening to the Jail Break CD over and overbut I was extremely disappointed with this CD. I Would suggest that you pass this one up.The"" best of"" collections are usually over rated and in my opinion that is the case here."
5,Before The Depression Set In,"This is not an album by the Bonzo Dog Band -- some of the tracks on here were never even played by the Bonzos (even though they sound like they could have been). Most were, however, so this album functions as a sort of precursor to the BDDDB sound, showing the novelty vaudeville roots from which the Bonzos (and the New Vaudeville Band and Tiny Tim) took their inspiration. Many fine 78s have been dubbed (and cleaned up remarkably) to make a pleasant soundtrack for reading F. Scott Fitzgerald novels and dancing the Lindy Hop."
1,Very disappointing.,"The idea itself may sound interesting but in my opinion, the author squandered it. While Shinobu Kokoro is supposedly about a group of ninjas, don't let that fool you. There's about as much here about ninjas as there is about tea-- both are mentioned in passing.There may be slightly more plot to this book than to Level-C manga, but don't bet on becoming excited over any actual sneaking-and-spying adventures. This book is all about the sex between the supposed ninjas."
3,Not For Me,"Before anyone rips me a new one- I freely admit that the time period and ridiculous speach of that time were likely my main reason for not enjoying this book as much as I could have. The author certainly provided us with an abundance of mythical characters to enjoy. And the fact that our hero Klaus was swedish was a nice twist.Still, it took me over 2 weeks to grapple my way though the book. Through a large amount of inanities and eye rolling while I thought ...ugh, when will this book be over?Set in the early 1800's, it's not an ecxeptional setting. And from a historical perspective the tale didn't provide much. But it was a very interesting premise, the fossegrin - King of the Sirens & waterfalls. Sorry for fans of Ms. Thompson that I didn't enjoy it that much. Why don't you pick it up to decide on yourself? If your a diehard historical romance reader you'll likely really enjoy it."
1,Beware,"The text may be fine, the accompanying documentation is probably useful, but every single image in the illustration section (promoted as ""showing the complete work of art, details, preliminary studies, and iconographic sources"") is a blurry, faded, miserable black and white photo. Except for the cover (don't be fooled), there is no color in the book. For an art book in the 21st century, there is really no excuse for this. It's infuriating."
5,Just as expected,"These beige fishnet tights by Givenchy arrived on time and in perfect condition. I love them so much, I plan to order another pair."
3,Eh...,"The scarf I received isn't bad.. ..I think it's a little thin and the size estimate of 42""x42"" is off by a good 2-2.5"" each way.. I had hoped for something a little more substantial with less threads flying off it and bigger. Maybe I've got a big head/face or something, but it doesn't seem to wrap quite right. All in all, it's not that bad for the price. It will live most of it's days in my bag until I need it. These Pennsylvania deserts around here are brutal, but not enough that I'm going to wear it as a fashion statement or as a status/political statement.Something more silk-like and a finer weave is what I was expecting I guess. But. Hey. You live and you learn. Product came fast and was packaged well. I'll probably look for something more like the HUGE silk bandanas I've become used to next time."
5,Very Useful makes a thick warm scarf,"Just got this scarf, looks better than I thought and depending on how you fold it it makes a think warm scarf or a light weight sun protection for your head."
4,Very good value for plain cotton,"Cheap, quick, and dirty. Suits my purposes. I don't expect a lot of durability from this thing, but that's all right - I'd like to be able to abuse it and then have no problem buying a new one when it gets too chewed up."
5,"Quality shemagh, warm","I ordered the olive drab from Army Universe, and I was very happy with the arrival time. With standard shipping, it arrived before the estimated time by a day.The scarf is very large, unfolded while standing up it reaches from my throat to my shins, but this is normal.It is very warm and very comfortable, and it even has a nice smell.There was an annoying tag on one of the corners which interfered in folding it but you could probably just cut that off.I plan on buying more of these from this seller!"
2,Poor quality,"Arrived promptly and good communication with seller. Regretfully, the product was cheap, thin, and scratchy. I ordered the white/black one. I quickly was able to return this for a refund, at my shipping expense however. The return policy says something at a restocking fee so we'll see if I get my full refund or not.Then I ordered a shemagh from a different seller and love it! I ordered it from an amazon storefront called ""Classical Fitness & Health"" found at www.amazon.com/shops/classical_media. It was $8.99, great quality, tag says ""Made in India"", vibrant colors, soft, thick, and durable."
5,Good quality scarf made in India and not China,Love the quality of these. I bought a few other brands and they were total crap. They're even better than the ones I have that were made in Palestine in the 1980s. The only minus is that they don't have the classic black and white style.
5,better than I was expecting,"I love these things. I do a fair amount of outdoor excursions, and this is one of my standard EDC (every day carry) items among or away from civilization. It's great aerated shade in hot environments, also in cold environments scrunched up or folded is good for warmth insulation, and regardless of the weather the design looks quite fashionable as well. Not to mention the nearly endless list of uses a bandana has in general, any boyscout or survivalist/bushcraft people out there know what's up.I ordered the Olive Drab color and the Blue. They are definitely higher quality than I was expecting. 100% cotton, nice and soft. I am pleased and will order again."
4,It Will Get The Job Done,"I've never owned a shemagh before so I have nothing to compare to but I was pleased with what I got. I ordered the olive drab so I could use it to cover my head hunting and i think it will work nicely. The shemagh is very large, it fits my head and I can't buy hats my head is so big. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a shemagh."
1,Not what I expected,"The scarf is a lot smaller that what you would think. When you see an arab wrapping his head in a scarf, it is quite long. This scarf is only square. Pity"
4,mac uzer,"Game is fun worked fine on my MBP, sometimes it does crash when i start it up, but then i just reload and it works fine. My grip is that the game is too short, and once your big and bad, no one can touch you. The other is that I would like to get Fable 2 and 3 on mac, (as well as other RPG etc... games) but I don't think that will happen any time soon.Anyway I bought this game while in Afghan, and it got to me soon enough, no damage, so Amazon did fine."
4,Unusual continuo,"A very good but not outstanding performance, medium tempo, but with a very unusual Baroque guitar as the most prominent part of the continuo in Spring and Autumn. This gives the performance an ususually rounded sound and alleviates the sharp sound of the violins. Listen to the first movement of Spring until about the half-way point when the guitar enters for a sample."
5,Brutally honest,"If you don't want to read about mobsters who performed crimes don't read this book. If you don't want to read about a smart guy who got swept into the mob life and only got out when he went to jail, don't read this book. If you don't want to read about a guy who spent twenty years as second in command to a ferocious mob boss, now on the FBI's Most Wanted List,don't read this book. If you do want to spend a few hours with a first row seat into one of the most fascinating minds in criminal history, read this book. It's well written, full of action and as close a glimpse into the life real mobsters, not the ones on TV, lead, that you'll ever get. I can't recommend it enough. This Kevin Weeks was there, saw it all, lived it all and now writes it all. You have to give this guy credit. He tells the whole story. If you have an interest in true crime, you've gotta read this fabulous true crime book."
3,"Brutal history of a ""hit"" man",This book has a killing almost every page. Well not exactly but his antics are very interesting. It really happened is the interesting thing.You will enjoy it.
3,enjoyed it,Was good book i also read bulger brothers and i beleave some were in between both books is truth this book was more entetaining other was lot of politics
4,"Good reading, very entertaining","Since I didn't know anything about the whole story of the bulger brothers or anything related with the south boston mafia. I can not say whether his facts on the story are true or not. When I heard Weeks on the radio promoting his book. I found him very interesting and honest. Immediately bought the book, and I got say it is really good. It takes you from his tough childhood, relationship with whitey (James Bulger) and associates to the end of mafia era in the late 90's. This book tells pretty much everything from extortions, murders, shakedowns and drug dealings that were ocurring in South Boston back in that time.This book is a good read, especially if you are not involved with south boston and all the stuff that happened there during that time."
2,BRUTAL,Not as good as STREET SOLDIER...Long winded... it all just seems to run together after 3/4 of the book
5,Just heard Weeks speak,"I am about to read the book, so I'm only rating it based on anticipated enjoyment, but I just got home from a book talk in the Boston 'burbs featuring Weeks and his co-writer, but mainly Weeks. He is one tough guy, but genuine (as genuine as criminals get) and smart. If his book is half as riveting as his presentation and the ensuing discussion were, I won't put it down til I've hit the last page. Can't wait to crack the cover. By the way, Whitey's in Europe. ;)"
4,Light Duty Safe,I have two of these safes and they work perfectly each and everytime. They give me peace of mind knowing the grandkids (six) will notbe in a unsafe atmosphere and still the weapon is ready for my use. Ireally wish there was an easier way to replace the batteries as I havemine mounted so the safes can not be moved. This causes the back to behard to access. Replace the batteries yearly.
5,Super,"Super for the Police Television show fans , Blonde Sexy Women fans , Angie Dickinson fans .And those of us wholived in the 70's."
4,it is essiential for the novice and expert,"it is a great reference for any expert as well it is the source for technical information for the keen novice it's simplicity to explain each section of HVAC systems, theory and application makes this book a grteat source for learning students, to enhance their ability to deal with complex applications, techniques and easy procedure to service such systems"
4,Useful and relatively quiet,"Despite the other reviews you may see, this blower does not compare to industrial strength blowers. It's not going to blow down the little piggies' brick house!However it is *fairly* powerful and pretty quiet for the amount of air it pushes. Overall recommended.Other notes: It pivots up and down, but the fan exhaust is at the top. So if you want it to blow under something - like a wet carpet to dry it out(!), just turn it upside down and it will balance on its handle just fine."
4,Nice Stanley Fan,This is a nice and powerful fan and does what the description says but a week after I purchased it on Amazon I saw the exact unit in a different color made by Stanley for MUCH less in a local hardware store.
2,Stainless steel is too thin.,"Stainless steel is too thin. item arrived with six dings on bottom of pot , its manufacturer box was torn and taped all over. disappointed that amazon would ship a product in such a condition. had to return it."
3,"the shaolin way:10 modern secrets of survival from a shaolin grandm,aster","Very good book, very interesting if you like martial arts."
4,good device,I bought this device for my xbox and it works great glade I can still find stuff online for my old gameing systems.
4,Same guy who wrote the first review has changed his mind.,"There is MUCH more ""Power"" on this CD than I originally thought. It is mostly pure-hard-core-punk and thrash. It is a great-sampler if you want to hear what REAL-PUNK IS!"
3,Annoying voice,"I heard a song by dirty blonde on the radio yesterday, and the lead singer's voice is really annoying. I can't stand it! The band is good though."
3,Not for GRE,Bought it for my GRE preparation. Not much help. I feel GRE is higher level than this book. Good luck..
1,Magix CD&DVD burnr deluxe,"The worst sftwr I've ever bought. A friend and I spent an entire afternoon trying to make it work before finally deciding it wasn't us but the software. It is not intuitive and is poorly written. IRS manuals are clear and concise compared to this garbage. Heed the other reviews, do not buy this software."
2,DVD Burner issue,"As delivered this product only burns to DVD -R, but nothing on the box gives you that warning. Of course they say to visit the site for updates, but that is currently under maintenance."
4,An Anthology of Messages and Remembrances,"This book contains dozens of messages and essays, some ofwhich were written by persons who knew they would soon beremembered via the Quilt, so their stories seem especiallypoignant, but it is good that they recorded their feelingsand thoughts for posterity.Other stories are by friends, lovers, parents, etc.One of the longer stories is ""My Own Little Message"" whichI wrote some years back.-John MorseAlbany NYMarch 2005"
2,Better than its predecessor but still weak,"The author continues the series with his fondness for setting up an interesting situation and then letting it drop into chaos.This book was definitely better than the last one, primarily because of the supporting characters. Planet acts as a regulator to the character's worst behavior patterns and offers insights into the author's view that humans are a pretty petty and contenious bunch.My basic problems with the series continue. I like to think that humanity has improved over the last few thousand years and is capable of further improvement. The author seems to disagree, if he is correct, we are all doomed to be short-sighted, nasty, brutish, and a menace to ourselves, our neighbors, and our planet."
2,Poor English,"Take a look at the sample - in those few pages the author shows his English is poor (and his editor should be fired). He uses ""infer"" when he means ""imply"", ""prodigy"" when he means ""protégé"", ""through"" instead of ""throughout"", the list goes on.Beyond that, the style is plodding."
2,I couldn't find the Italian audio. Guess it's not on the DVD,I'm very disappointed. I've bought the DVD to have the italian audio and I cannot find it. I'm pretty sure it's not on the DVD so why the Amazon description says that the DVD includes the original italian audio?The video is pretty good but I'm mad for the missing original language track.
4,exciting and readable,"This is my first courtroom thriller, so I have no basis for comparison (except for Grisham's The Firm, which sucks). What I liked about The Judge is it has many things going for it: 1. Characters - all the players have personality and presence. 2. Lean narrative, good dialogue, no extraneous details. 3. Excitement. The trial scenes were great. 4. Style. I like how Martini sizes things up.The book is an easy read. In fact, Martini could have fleshed out the book with more information and twists and the story would still be taught. What he managed to do is only admit critical elements to the story to make it a story and keep it engaging. I hope to read more of his works."
4,Put in vacuum canister or bag,"My vet told me this and it really helps tremendously. Though I was vacuuming and spraying and powdering, etc., the flea invasion last summer was unbearable. Along with the treatment on my dog, he instructed me to place a collar in my vacuum receptacle. He said even though I vacuumed, the fleas and future-hatched larvae would escape. Not with this inside....dead! It definitely helped decrease the flea population inside the house."
2,I was going to get it.,"I was about to get it, but the intructions were not finished! I couldn't tell what I should do if my dog is pregnant! It just said ""If used on a pregnant dog d"" and it ended! :("
5,Kudos for fresh analysis,"Maybe not as good as the original Hockey Compendium that came out in the '80s, I believe, but it more than makes up with the fuller more detailed ""goalie perseverance"" (read the book and you'll see...basically save pct. rules over goals against average) stats. It's just nice to see that Klein and Reif are still alive and giving us stat freaks a witty and fun look at the game we all love."
2,Bleeding Heart Essays,"Tunku Vardarajan in the India today says, India: a Mosaic is a con job. The word ""mosaic"" suggests a variety in the book. Instead the book talks about ""bleeding-hearted"" essays. According to him, the articles in the book were published elsewhere and are ""profoundly stale."" From my reading of the book i found the book to be a ""do not buy."""
2,Too squeaky/loud,This is not the type of bean bag filler I'm used to (or want). They cause too much rustling noise.
2,Draaaaaaaaaagy,"i mean, sure the thing was meaningful n all, n touching but geee....boy was the thing long! i shouldave juz watched the movie."
1,"19th century, melodramatic...","This is the worst piece of English literature that I have everhad the misfortune of reading. The author pulls on your heartstringswith promises of happy endings and perfect promises, but in the end hedashes all of your hopes away with several fatal blows. I would not have finished reading this ""book"" if it had not been for all of the precious time I had invested into reading it. I wanted to incinerate the book when I began the final chapter, not only because I knew the ending, but primarily because the ending was concocted of wound stinging salt. I do not enjoy being utterly depressed by mere men such as Thomas Hardy. Once again, I'll reiterate; I loathe this.Anthony (extremely annoyed) Cross"
3,Classic? Hmmmph,I always suspected that classics were boring and bleak. This one proves me right. Okay story but far too dragged out.
1,Poor Designed Product. Dont buy.,"Do not be fooled by stainless steel frame. If you are buying a stove for outdoor use, this product isnt it for you. The burner is a poor designed cast iron with some silver colored paint. It has already rusted and will not last. So what the stainless steel frame for if its parts rust?Plus, the burner is only secured by one single screw. It rotates and tilts. If I would design this product, I would use brass. The burner should be secured on all three legs on a stainless steel plates which itself has to have at least three screws on the frame. The frame will need another Y shaped under bar to firm up the burner mounting.Dont think Bayou Classic have any good engineer. They should be removed from Amazon's vendor list if they do not improve.I am surprised Amazon markets such a poor product."
2,It costs $15.00 each to file your state and federal return,This is the same Turbo Tax we are all used to. We are also used to the fileing fee being part of the purchase price. Guess what? It's not. Very expensive way to file your return. I will be looking for a cheaper solution next year.
1,Out of date - wouldn't complete - useless,"Item initially loaded beautifully- but then would not complete taxes because ""online"" updates are no longer available.. so was useless. Had to manually load sheets from IRS and work myself... could have done that from the start. This product should not be sold without updates...Very dissatisfied."
3,TurboTax Offer,"Free e-mail filing was advertised. Could not submit with out a $70 cost. Refused this service and mailed thru post office. Very disappointed. Also, unable to get the free Quicken software offer on line and by mail requires a receipt of purchase of turbotax, which I do not have. I didn't initially retain receipt because I thought everything was online."
4,Updates now work,"There was a period where the updates didn't work correctly, but they have fixed that. So far, I'm happy with the product. I haven't yet finished and filed my return. TaxCut is no longer available for the Mac, so Turbo Tax is about the only option if you don't want to do your taxes online."
3,Must have Internet Connection,"I bought TurboTax hoping that all forms, included my state, were included on the CD. I wanted to use the program on my compuer not connected to the internet. The small print on the box was not clear if a connection to the internet was required. Alas, once I uploaded the CD I discovered a few of the Federal forms and all of my state forms needed to be downloaded. There is a toll free number you can call to ask for a supplemental CD to be mailed to you. However, when I called I was told, through a recording, to leave my name and address. I was told to expect a supplemental CD in 10-14 days. I doubted I would get it and I was right. Finally, I was forced to load TurboTax on my wife's computer, so I could download the updates.The software did run well, once loaded, and all of the forms printed out nicely."
3,Good Solution,Works good. Carries over information if you have used it previously. Their rates for electronic filing seem to go up every year.
3,We are aware of this problem,"I have used Turbo Tax for years. Everything went fine this year, including the final review, until I tried to file electronically. Then, I was told that I had an error (no state wages on a 1099) that had to be corrected for state filing. I went back and re-entered 3 times and overwrote 3 times - same problem. I searched for help and learned that they ""are aware of this problem"". I waited several days and tried again - same problem. I contacted Intuit by phone and was told that new filers would not have this problem, but that, once encountered, my problem could not be fixed other than be redoing my entire return. No thanks. Maybe next year I'll try Tax Cut!"
1,Limited to one import from previous year,"Although the product box and ads stress the ease of importing previous year's data from other programs, you can only import one such file.If you prepare returns for your children or parents (or possibly even a spouse filing a separate return), you won't be able to transfer previous year's data.Tax Cut has no such limitations, but I switched because Turbo can import my broker data (or at least it claims to).Check the Turbo tax website's user forum for hundreds of reports of import problems."
3,"TurboTax got sneaky this year. Customer ""service"" sucks.","I ordered TurboTax Federal and unlike last year this comes WITHOUT state. When I attempted to load state the product prompted for an ADDITIONAL $34.95. So I contacted them by e-mail (twice), on-line help (twice), and phone (twice). Guess what? Three of the six inquiries were something like ""well the states are not available yet but they'll be free"", two were ""look at our website for descriptions of the product"" which I'd BEEN using for years, and the last was it was all a mixup and it was ""not free."" So fortunately Amazon was VERY, VERY UNDERSTANDING and did what TurboTax refused to do and took it back. I switched to TaxCut. When I called them they provided REAL CUSTOMER SUPPORT! Go TaxCut!"
2,"What a scam, shame on Intuit","I purchased this tax software under the false presumption that e-filing would be included in the price, just like IT USED TO BE! The actual data entry process was ""ok"", a bit buggy as I had some K-1 income which TurboTax handles quite poorly. Of course that works fine if you buy the more expensive software, but if they claim it works, yeah, it does, barely.But then the ultimate blow... after all of the effort that took me weeks to prepare, it was time to file the return. What's this? I have to pay another $30 to e-file? And here I thought the IRS was ENCOURAGING people to e-file! Hey, I am in California where one MUST earn more than $50 to make a decent living, so who qualifies for the so-called "" e-file for FREE "" here? They gotchya!So it looks like I will have to send my tax return in by good old US mail, I'll wait the 3 or 4 weeks for the refund. Thanks for nothing, TurboTax."
1,Many bugs in 2005 TTax,"Before you decide to buy, I suggest you go to the Turbotax.com FORUM's and read about the problems reported there. I've used this software for a dozen years, and now I'm seeking another solution after spending hours trying to install their updates.Buyer beware."
5,Turbotax 2005 Review,"I started in business for myself in 2005 and was easily able to enter all of my business deductions on Schedule C and file for both a federal and state income tax refund. My state refund was direct deposited within three days and my federal should be arriving any day. It was easy, fast and economical - plus the software itself is a tax deduction!"
4,Must for every SQL expert,This book is not for beginners or people with little SQL knowledge. It helps to enhance your methodical approach for problem solving.It needs some more examples so that people with little knowledge of SQL can grasp it . I haven't seen any book comparable to this one for learning different techniques of writing tuned queries which seem to be very complicated in first approach.. Make sure you are not buying it to learn syntax
1,horrendous,"I love the Academy of Ancient Music but this recording of Beethoven's symphony no 9 is horrendous. I don't care what the metronome markings are; to me it is WAY too fast. The last movement is just a race to the finish; an unsatisfying, lightweight, superficial sounding one at that.Although removing all the vegetable shortening, corn syrup, artificial colors and artificial flavors that has been placed on top of Bach's music is a good thing, Beethoven's music is more like wine in that all those changes in smell and flavor that build up over time enhances it. The authenticity movement in this case removes all this and we are only left with grape juice."
5,Don't Be Hesitant to Buy This Phono PreAmp,"I needed a pre amp, I shopped Amazon and found several in varying price ranges. I decided on this one based on mostly positive reviews, and simplicity. The price was right, not cheap, but not over $50. It was simple. It arived in 2 days, took me all of 5 mins to hook up, and it provides perfect sound. No hum. I did not need to ground the unit.I might add, I have two TV's a VCR, a DVD player and of course the Receiver, Phono and PreAmp all within 4 feet of each other. I was concerned that I might get feedback. None. I would buy it again."
4,Necessary for Migrating Records to Digital Format,This compact unit makes a valuable difference in sound quality for those of us seeking to migrate an LP collection to a digital format (and maybe on to an MP3 player.) I found it to be necessary in order to get the job done in my Windows 7 Home Premium operating environment. Save time and buy this along with the migrating software. You won't want to move all of your fine stereo equipment to reach your computer every time you want to move an album and this compact unit will sit almost anywhere while you do the transfer. Some audiophiles always include a pre-amp in their kit to clean up the sound from their recordings. Maybe they will be interested in this item as well but that is not why I bought one and I can't speak to those needs. I just know that I couldn't do what I wanted to without this pre-amp and now I can.
2,DEAD BORED!!!,"John Sandford took a new path and got lost! If Jake said ""Ah Jeez; oh boy; oh man; once, he said it a hundred times. What is this guy - high school?I did not like this Jake Winters; I did not like Madison Bowe but the side characters were what kept me reading til the bitter end. A political thriller it was not! I almost feel insulted. This is a terrible thing to say: I'd rather have read a romance novel.Really did not care what happened to any of them. I left this brand new book on a Delta red eye flight and it will probably stay there.I will wait for Robert Crais, Lee Child and Harlen Coben for some gritty work!!!!!"
2,Dead Plot,"Very predictable ending, tedious plot and paper thin characters in this novel. Any other author, I probably would have given him/her 3 stars but I like to hold Sandford to a different standard because his ""Prey"" series novels are very well written with realistic action scenes and great dialogue. I couldn't identify with any of the characters in this book."
5,VERY good book. A great Read,"Before I bought this book I read some contrary comments about this book.Got it anyway.It was very very good, I couldn't put it down.The political intriuge was excellant!KUDOS to John Sandford!"
1,Very Disappoionting,"I am a John Sandford fan and have read all of his books. This one is boring with poorly developed characters and a ridiculous, convoluted plot. Could this be an early, unpublished manuscript that the publisher rolled out because Sandford sells? That is my suspicion. John Sandford is much better than this."
3,Unsatisfying,"I'm a long-time John Sandford fan. I have read each of his Prey and Kidd books (and ""The Night Crew""). I was pretty eager to read something new from Sandford. The first half of the book was very intriguing. By then you know what's going on and it's just a matter of bringing everything together to some sort of conclusion. Some might like this book, but I have to say it's on my ""bottom 5"" list of Sandford novels (but still better than a few Prey installments)."
1,"Junk. Cheap paper, not cardboard. Save your money.","Bought this thinking I could make some cardboard UFO type small UFO models, but when it came in the mail I realized it was better suited for lining my parakeet bird cage. The UFO models are printed on cheap paper, same as comes out of a computer printer or is in any cheap book. So to me this item is worthless. Just know what you are getting if you decide to order this."
4,Coffee Table Doll Book,"I would consider this book a coffee table book. Why??...Because the photos are like the larger photos used in basic coffee table books. Nothing wrong with that, but this book just skims over the various doll categories. Thus, it is a basic doll book with lovely photos, & great for beginner doll collectors."
2,Listing was false,"This battery was advertised as ""with Authentic Nokia Hologram"" - Not!Not only was the hologram missing, it had no brand name at all.(I haven't used it yet, so I can't say it won't work just as well.)"
5,One of the best Recovery products available!,"A-Bomb fuels muscle growth long after your workout with a patented 12 hour metered dose technology. I use this product as a natural post workout and recovery aid.The L-Leucine, L-Isoleucine, and L-Valine ensure muscle and joint repair after exercise. Also, the GKG (Glutamine Alpha-Ketoglutarate) is very beneficial to organs and muscles.A-bomb is easy to digest and it contains no stimulants which can interfere with sleep. I am very impressed with A-bomb and with MHP(the company that has developed A-bomb)This is a five star product."
2,"Sorry, Didn't Work for Me","This product may work for some people, but our (2) little rats are either very intelligent, or they don't care. We have been trying to catch them since November (of '07), with 3 different types of traps in two sizes. This was the latest attempt.I swear, at night, I can hear them singing, ""I'm al-right....""Karen S."
1,Did not work on my Groundhogs,"I sprinkled this liberally all around the holes where the groundhogs come under my fence and under my shed. They continued to walk straight through the powder like they didn't know it was there. It occurred to me that there are dogs all around, which would seem a natural predator to a grounghog, but if the groundhogs don't see the dogs they come out anyway. They are too bold for a subtle measure like this."
1,Worked great.. for about 2 days.,"It kept the chipmunks away for about two days, then they were right back into everything in my yard. Gotta find a better solution."
1,Waste of Money,There is a groundhog in my neighborhood that keeps digging under the fence in my yard. I bought this product in hopes of stopping this. I used the granules in conjunction with with Messina Wildlife Groundhog Stopper. It made absolutely NO difference. The groundhog DID sniff around a little and went on about his business.
2,it didn't work,I put it out as directed. The skunks didn't care and simply tried to bury it instead of running away for their lives as I expected.
1,Use traps,"None of this stuff works in Wisconsin. The animals are constantly digging up my potted plants. I tried the fox urine and it did nothing. I tried the various owl scare crows, they did nothing. The only thing that works, and is humane, are live traps. I just trapped 2 chipmunks and 1 vole in 3 days. From now on I'll stick with what works."
1,NG,"It did not work, though we used tons of it around the flowers, perimeter, etc etc etc. The little furry friends ignored it and had a feast, anyway!"
3,"Great start, slow finish","I believe that this is a great product and a good idea. Possums, who have a penchant for chewing on electrical wires, had moved into my attic. It's an old house with avenues where I could never ever find them. I put the proper amount in knee stockings and tossed them up. Almost immediately, the possums made their escape. They came back each morning and night, but stayed only 20 minutes. They tried to find spaces that weren't exposed. Then they figured it out. I like gentler, kinder remedies and it was worth a try. BTW, don't be concerned about the dire warnings. I called and the lady told me that the regulators forced them to include warnings because it is fox pee, but the product isn't dangerous at all. I recommend it. It's worth a try and just might work better in your circumstance."
3,Try something else...,"I bought these granules because I have a problem in my yard with a woodchuck and a baby bunny. I followed the instructions and it looks like it might have actually worked on driving the woodchuck away. However, the baby bunny has no fear. I think he laughs at me every time he sees me sprinkling the stuff and then he just hops on over to eat all of my perennials. I'm giving this product 3 stars only because it seems to have worked on the woodchuck. Otherwise, it would be zero stars."
1,Ad is Bogus,"I give it NO stars, but it's not an option here. Ad states this is an Organic product. Label on product states NOTHING about being organic. Ad states there is Garlic Oil in here, ad states there is 5% Fox Urine and 95% Other Ingredients and does not go into what those ingredients are.Ad states not harmful to children or domestic animals. Label has a big FIRST AID label on it and clearly states it is harmful to humans and domestic animals. My dog is highly attracted to the smell of it. Ad states not harmful to plants, label states NOT to put in on plants that are edible food products. Only use around the perimeter of them. I bought this for a container thinking it was an organic product and instead got a product that I have NO idea what's in it and my dog can not stay away from it."
2,Plodding,"What a great cast, but also a great waste. I don't think there would be a tenth of the interest in this film if not for the major stars attached to the film. As others have said the movie is basically a woman wakes up in a funeral home after an accident. The mortician can see and hear her, but does he have a special power or is she not really dead. Sounds intriguing, but the movie plods predictably toward the end. The one big draw is seeing Christina Ricci naked, which actually happens through most of the film. Other than that, this wasn't a great film."
4,Psycho creepy scary thriller that will fool you into believing,"Friends, if you are not into 'scary mind twisting thrillers' you will rate this video low. But all should agree Liam Neeson (Eliot Deacon) was perfect for this part. His demeanor, appearance and his tone of voice was super! Because of his acting ability several times during this movie/video I thought I had PROOF of the REAL things that were happening, but each time I was tricked into switching from being a believer then non believer. I ended up thinking he did have special powers. However, the closet full of pictures and personal items, the open eyed pictures on the wall, the phone call and burying the baby chick still leads me to wonder if this might be a psychological killer, but... Please don't let the limited upper nudity of Christina Ricci make you avoid this video, it was necessary and forgive me titillating(onomatopoeia intended)."
2,Disappointing,I saw this on demand. Great cast but it never comes together. The thrill was missing in this thriller. The plot was plodding and predictable. The movie felt very derivative of others that came before it and there was something lacking. It is basically a movie about a dead girl who says she is not dead. You have to wait 1 and 1/2 hours to find out if she is or not. It's a long wait.
3,After life,"Movie had some good moments, but was some what confusing. The ending seemed to sum it all up, he was burying people alive. It appears Liam's charactor may have been a bubble off in this movie. Over all it kept you guessing."
5,Finally in English -- one of the great novels of the century,"Agnon deserved his Nobel Prize. His most important work, Only Yesterday, casts an array of lights into the inner world of Judaism. Anyone who enjoys Bashevis Singer or Sholom Aleichem will kick themselves for the years they wasted without Agnon, who surpasses them. The translation itself is a wonder. It reproduces the Biblical style of narrative which Agnon brought to modern Hebrew literature. Agnon melds the traditional elements of Rabbinic parable and folkloric animal stories into the modern narrative of the turn-the-century Jewish settlers of Palestine. All in all, the appearance of the English translation is a great event, a must read for lovers of Jewish literature."
5,a great novel,"This is a novel about the early 20th Century life of the Jewish Yishuv in Eretz Yisrael (mainly Jaffa and Jerusalem, prior to the founding of Tel-Aviv), which was then part of the Ottoman's province of Syria. The narrative uses a typical Agnon's satirical style. It has several intertwined story lines, which towards the end merge into an unexpected finale."
2,This guy hasn't done his homework,"(First of all, this is coming from a huge [Christian] fan of the HP books.) While some of his points do make since, most are not sufficiently explained, and are therefore unbelieveable. Killinger makes a lot of glaring mistakes; for example, he doesn't seem to understand the concept of a dementor other than the fact that it can (can being the main word) suck out one's soul. He also gives quite a few incorrect discriptions of exact events in the books. (An example: He said that Hagrid had turned Vernon Dursley to a pig in Sorcerer's Stone, but he actually gave DUDLEY Dursley a pig's TAIL.) The one crucial point that I think he has actually brought across is the role of good vs. evil in the series.Overall, if you are a person who is looking to see if the series is appropriote for you or your children, buy this book. Otherwise, if you are a fan looking for a good defence of the books, don't waste your time."
2,The King James Bible is SUPREME,"I originally purchased this book because I too am an advocate of the King James Bible. My hope was that this book would compare the KJB to other versions and promote it above all other translations with facts. Although there are many facts, it seams that the author was more intent on attacking the people that translated and use other versions. ""Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things."" Romans 2:1"
4,This Ceramic hone is great.,"I've always used a diamond stone to keep my knives sharp, but it was a hassle to use all the time.I decited it was time to get a good honing steel to do this job. This ceramic ""steel"" is the perfect tool for this job. Once you get a sharp edge on your knife,with diamond stones, just keep it sharp by dragging the knife across the "" steel"" at about 20 degrees from flat. Do this a few times befor you use it,and it will keep that edge sharp!Great tool!!"
5,Jeremy rocks...and so do I!!!!,"Well, I am 18 years old, and I was named after this awesome movie. It's such a simple, wonderful story. I actually have an original poster from the movie. On it is the wonderful quote: ""A film that has nothing going for it but the people who love it,"" and that's exactly what it is. Those who don't enjoy Jeremy simply can't get past the fact that is very dated. If you are a Robby Benson fan, watch American Dreams on Sundays (though he doesn't play a very nice character). If you're a fan of both Robby and Glynnis O'Connor, there is a 1977 version of Thornton Wilder's Our Town where they play the leads (Emily and George). I highly recommend this. Though this version of Our Town is very hard to come by, it can be bought on Amazon at the rental market price ($75). Otherwise, some public libraries and universities sometimes will have a copy."
5,Words Their Way: Syllables and Affixes,Syllables and Affixes is the most difficult of the spelling stages to teach. Words Their Way: Syllables and Affixes clearly describes how to teach the features of this phase.
3,"Good concept, but Darkbasic pro is a better choice","I own both this and darkbasic pro,I would like to say that they are both great products, but not for those with no programing mentality. Writting a game requires good understanding in maths and generaly thinking in a clear logical way. So it is not as easy as it says on the packaging. The tutorial on the manual is very good, and will get you started writting first person shooter games in no time. Otherwise, the manual is very poor when it comes to describing what the commands do. Only the syntax is explained properly. The actual function of the commands is not very clear unless you already know what you are doing, or the command is a very basic one.This programing language needs a good book to accompany it before it gains any value."
2,"Good idea, but bad design","I got this as a present about two years ago, and I have had mixed feelings. I like it, but I get really frustrated because the program is buggy. I cannot create a standalone executable, and the program has random bugs. Also, it is very hard to create proffesional-type games. Be aware that the machine you run standalone programs on has to have a video card, regardless of whether you use it or not. In conclusion, good idea, but very buggy."
2,Only Good For Complete Beginners,"DarkBASIC is only good for people very new to programming and interested in games. To make a commercial-quality game in this language would be lunacy, BASIC just isn't quite flexible enough to do that with ease, and the DarkBASIC renderer looks very, very ugly. However, BASIC remains very easy to learn and DarkBASIC has some commands that are fun to toy with.If you're trying to get into serious game development, learn C++ and either learn how to use libraries like OpenGL or DirectX, or start modding a popular engine like the Unreal engine or Source. And make sure you've learned a good deal of physics and math."
4,"Sort of depressing, but a good read",I was hooked into the story in the first few pages and kept on reading. This isn't a fairy tale so not really any neatly tied up strings - kept me guessing until the end. The author gives some references for her inspiration and I plan on checking them out.
1,Puh-leeze!!!!,"I have never read any books by this author, and as far as I'm concerned, I will not be reading any more by him. About half-way through the book, I was COMPLETELY lost. I had to start all over again and try to figure out what was going on, and I still couldn't. So finally, I just gave up and put the book down. Mr. Martini, puh-leeze!"
1,Nothing but holes,"Martini writes exciting stores. Roller-coaster rides. BUT in Prime Witness there is no investigation.Example: No one (the police or Madriani) bothers to find out who owns the land upon which thebodies were found until the trial is almost over (and low and behold it belongs to the murderer. likewow man how dumb can a murder be especially when you find out just who he is. no dummy). Andas in ""The Judge"" the ending is so shockingly ridiculous it's a laugh. I've read 3 Martini books so farand would only recommend ""Compelling Evidence"". Skip ""Prime Witness"" and ""The Judge""."
5,A BEAUTIFUL BOOK,"Although I am a ""child of the city"", I must say that this elegant book gives me some pause. Not in this lifetime, but perhaps in the next, I will be fortunate enough to find myself among such lovely people doing such lovely things. See for yourself!"
2,The Seduction,"Storyline and writing were initially fantastic. The ending went south....seemed weak as though the author got bored, and the story turned to mush....disappointed in the end."
4,"If you're looking for hot, steamy romance, read this!",I give it 4 stars because there is some cheesy dialogue and the characters are a bit 2 dimensional. But the plot was unique and the amorous scenes are HOT! This might be one of the steamiest romance novels I've ever read.This is my first Nicole Jordan novel. I plan to read more of her stuff. Hopefully it is as good as this one (and maybe a bit better!)
4,A Vigorous and Real Love Story,"I liked this book despite myself, and will look forward toreading more of Ms. Jordan's books. The premise of this book mightturn away some readers but unless you are morally offended by love scenes, do read it. Nicole Jordan draws characters with whom a reader can sympathize and care about. One may not like some of the behavior, but one reads on hoping, wishing, knowing that matters will turn out satisfactorily. Ms. Jordan shows us a bit of the underside of aristocratic life with visits to a brothel and a Hellsfire club. The book reads like a love story of real people with the prospect of a happy ending not always certain."
5,Scholarship and Jesus,"This well written work is the capstone book of the author's earlier trilogy on Jesus. Starting with the Gospel of John and then moving to Paul's letters and then to the Synoptic Gospels, Vermes peals away the layers of gospel theological commentary in his attempt to discover the historical Jesus. Vermes is a Dead Sea Scrolls expert, as well as a well-published scholar on First Century Judaica. This is a thought provoking work for believers and nonbelievers. However, excellent scholarship about Jesus still can present only conjecture. Despite his erudite scholarship, Vermes does understand this point."
2,Highly disappointed,"This book started off extremely slow and never did pick up to the pace that I was expecting. I had heard so many good things about this author and her books, I was excited to read it, but I could have left it on the shelf. I guess I should not have read it after the fast action pace of Supreme Justice. But, I won't be deterred. I have another book by this author and hopefully will like it better than this one"
5,Easy to read,"I found this book a very easy read, which is important in trying to explain epilepsy to children. To educate children of the disorder is something that might seem like an difficult task, something thats pushed off to the side for a later date. However, with this book, its a task that doesn't look so daunting. You can explain epilepsy to your children in language that they understand."
5,Great Item,Item received just as described. Quick shipment. I enjoyed all four DVDs. Received in time for Christmas to enjoy fully.
1,Scam or error??? Either way... Very unhappy!,"Received our order (purchased as a Christmas gift). Opened the box to find only a copy of the holiday vacation movie - not the whole set! Yep! Paid Amazon a lot of $$ for a movie that we found at Walmart for $5.00. Another issue we had was returning. If we returned the purchase, would it appear that we were only returning 'part' of our order? Also, at this point, we were still in need of a gift ( yep... Back to Walmart to purchase the complete set there). Really wished there had been an Amazon phone number to call to discuss the error and to try to fix the mistake."
2,Good Collection - bad quality DVDs,"Its a great set, but the DVDs kept freezing up and skipping - I have yet to see how the other that I bought from the same vendor turn out - hopefully better."
5,best movie set e er,I love the national lampoon vacation movies. it is great to have them all on one set.
1,"Edited versions, made for tv versions","Disappointing. Buyer beware, these are pg-13 versions. If that's what you were looking for, you found it. Those who are looking for the original uncut versions, there is another set. I wish I had known before I bought this. 2 DVD's total, front and back type."
4,Excellent collection but...,"A couple of the DVDs skip here and there, but this may be attributed to my very cheap and old DVD player, not necessarily to the quality of the product. Maybe it's time for a new DVD player?? ;) I'm still happy with my purchase."
1,the anti-purchase,I ordered national lampoon's vacation series. Never received it. Credit card charged then credited (thank you) but never received any notification as to cause or reason. It seems you should have some quality control follow up. At least let the customer know what's happening so they can take action.
4,classic collection,"As with most movies, the first was the best (although xmas vacation is darn close). European wasn't too great but Vegas was mildly funny. Chevy, you rock."
5,Not what I expected,I bought this book to help me learn to catch dolphin with a fishing pole....and it didn't even cover the right baits and lures to use! Other than that it's a great book.
5,An entertaining and insightful read on dolphin research,"This is for people that like dolphins.An extreme challenge for people that want to study dolphins is that dolphins live under water, swim fast and swim long distances.She was one of the first people to study dolphins in shark bay in Australia that was special in that it is a rare place where dolphins live near the shoreline and the water is shallow enough to visually follow the dolphins.This starts out as Smolker as an undergrad in college where she first hears about shark bay. She and another student fly there for the summer to check it out. The book tells her story and the story of the dolphins, and of the dolphin research as she works her way through to her PhD.Research at shark bay was pivotal to further and on going research on dolphin behavior in the wild. If you are interested in dolphin research you will find this book a fascinating read."
4,This book,I'm reading this book with my Mom and it's pretty good. It's very interesting how the author got to study the dolphins.
2,"Not really right for our program, but still good.","An interesting program and really enjoyed the treatment of the subject, but it really did not fit with our program, so sadly, I had to return it. I would still recommend it, just make sure it fits your district standards."
2,"Not Granola, more like mixed bag","Remember when your mother mixed all the odds and ends of the cereal boxes together so you would eat them before she went to buy some ""real"" cereal? This not-a-granola reminds me of that, more than anything else. It has corn flakes, sliced almonds, crumbs of something, and lumps of what I think they mean to be granola, but it looks rather pigeon-like, if you get my drift. The cereal is fairly tasty, although I get an overwhelming scent and taste of artificial vanilla, hence the two stars.If you want granola, there are plenty of alternatives here to choose from. If you want something to remind you of budget day before Dad got paid, then this is perfect."
5,TASTE GREAT,BOXES FELT 2/3 FULL. I POURED CEREAL IN A BOWL AND IT MEASURED CORRECTLY. THERE ARE LARGE CLUSTER AND THEY ARE SOOO GOOD. VERY GOOD COMPANY.
5,On my top 10 Holocaust films,This story will have you on the edge of your seat. What people are willing to do for those who needed to be saved who where innocent...they should never have needed to be saved but we know it happened anyway.The love and compassion shown will have you in tears. The nazi's will make you so angry.A must see for mature Holocaust movie viewer's.
2,Always the Bridesmaid,"This book was a letdown. Having recently spent some time in Ireland I was eagerly anticipating a fun chick read taking place there. Instead, I found the main character annoying, whiny and completely self-absorbed! Additionally, she used everyone around her and gave not much back! I found her unlkeable. The author threw in random scenes of drunkenness and one night stand type sex & frankly I couldn't figure out how such a generally unlovable individual would be attracting all those men. I stuck this book out to the end hoping that I'd get a glimpse of a likeable person in the protagonist but didn't. I suggest instead Patricia Scanlan's books which also take place in Dublin."
3,A bit depressing but a good read!,"Amy's life is not working out how she planned. She is going no where in her job, she is turning 30, she is single and everyone around her is either married or getting married. Her sister has brought home a hunk from Australia and is now engaged; her best friend Beth has gotten engaged to Tony her life in boyfriend. Then Amy sees her ex-boyfriends car in the drive of her best friend's house. She goes to pieces.Amy is so unsure about herself that when a good looking man Stevie J. asks her out she continually drives him away. At least her career seems to be finally going in the correct direction, she is making sets for a children's show and they love her work. Maybe she just might get the dream job that she has always wanted.You also get to learn about depression and how it effects how people deal with certain situations."
3,"Cute idea, but poor quality","My 3-year-old daughter loves fishing games, so I purchased this for her. It's a cute toy, but the round part of the handle broke off the first night she played with it."
3,Flat and uninspiring,"I purchased this 5 cd set in 1991 and have tried to like it many times. The technical quality of the recording is fine, most done in the 1980's. But I prefer a more lively period instrument performance with more snappy tempo such as done by John Eliot Gardiner, Trevor Pinnock and Ton Koopman. The crowd favourites such as Pachelbel Canon, Arrival of the Queen of Sheba, Handel Music for the Royal Fireworks, Vivaldi Four Seasons and J. S. Bach Brandenburg Concertos are okay, but flat and uninspiring in comparison to the competition. That's the way I hear it."
5,Very well written,Excellent comentary of our world today... the words come straight from his heart... makes you really think!
2,Nice album but not her best.,"I like Mina but I am not crazy about this album , I cannot play repeatedly,it's a little monotonous.If you're looking for something truly adventurous and never boring, passionate and sensuous in the 'jazz standards' category, then, please listen to 'Lazy Afternoon' by Regina Belle.You will never thank me enough for that :-)"
5,typical 7' standard weight-bar,I had to buy this weight bar because all my weights are standard and when i switched over to an olympic weight-bench the bar i was currently using was to short. this bar is exceptional. I like that it has marks on it to know where your hands should go just like an olympic-bar. It's a great bar. I like using it and am glad i bought it.
2,Better material is available,"Kent Hovind is not a scientist, biologist, or archeologist. He was a Christian school teacher who begain collecting and compiling information and theories about creationism and evolution into a series of lectures and sermons. Some of what he has to say is good, while some is rejected by even creationists. Dr. Hovind is also a believer in conspirarcy theories regarding the UN, the US Government, and 9-11, and is a tax resister (which led to his conviction on tax evasion charges). While this has little to do with his work on creationism, it does call into question his credibility.If you want to research or study creationism, I recommend that you pass on Dr. Hovind's work and check out material by organizations like Answers In Genesis and Creation Ministries International. They employ real scientists and are much more reliable sources of creationist material."
3,Good but too crowded,This book has very important information for the study of postcards; however the design is not good at all. The trademarks are very crowded and it is very hard to identify an specific trademark.
1,Garbage,Completely useless piece of equipment. Does not work. Don't buy this thing. This pump will not get anywhere near proper inflation.
5,Great size for a saddle bag and effective!,"This is a very durable pump! It's made right and is small enough to fit in a saddle bag or your rear jersey pocket. I suggest the larger size if you use a pack on your rides to pump your tire up a bit faster. The gauge is quite helpful, especially if you don't have the 'feel' of the tire down yet. It has a dual volume option that is essential for getting the last few pounds of pressure in. Crank Bros have got pumps nailed (as well as pedals)!"
2,Superseded by Margaret Washington's 2009 bio,"I used to love this book and found it very compelling when I read it several years ago. However, Margaret Washington's new (2009) biography of Truth vets the historical sources far more carefully. Washington's work has the effect of overturning much of what Painter presents as ""truth"" (pun intended) and offering a much fuller, more contextualized, and more convincing narrative of Truth's life."
2,"Good features, but not smooth","You get what you pay for. Pros: great price, compact, easy to use. Cons: small wheels, just not smooth enough. Isn't smooth enough on a perfectly smooth floor, so any cracks or crumbs or anything on the floor and it defeats the purpose of the dolly because it's bumby and shakey (this is taking into account that you are filming while moving. If you only need the dolly to move easier while not filming then this would be a great product). Other con is that these castors (wheels) are not designed to be easily removed and thus replaced with others such as air tires."
4,Great for light studio use,"This is a light weight, but sturdy dolly. It is perfect for light studio use on boom stands and tripods. It Can support 30-40 lbs with no problems. The large soft wheels provide for smooth movement over cracks and crevices. Be care when rolling over cables. Most of my boom stands and all of my tripods open wider than the dolly stand, which introduces some instability for top heavy loads. Also the foot operated wheel locks are a bit awkward, but more than serviceable and nowhere near a deal breaker.Overall, the quality of the build is consistent for the price. I do not recommend this dolly for video use although it would work well on a smooth surface."
2,"I want to buy this story, but not this movie",I agree - the version with Jane Seymour was better and I wish that was available to buy.
1,Simplistic,"This is a poor performance, poorly written and produced for a youthful audience. It is not adult fare."
5,"I confess, I had a dueced good time watching these movies","The Scarlet Pimpernel has long been one of my favorite novels because of the adventure and witty dialogue. This movie brings out all of the fine points of Baroness Orczy's fabulous tale. Richard E. Grant is hilarious and dashing. The attention to historical details are, for the most part, accurate. Those interested in the French Revolution will be tickled to hear ""ca ira"" played throughout the first episode. They will also enjoy the actor who plays the diabolical Robespierre, his dead eyes and foppish attire seem to capture the essence of the Incorruptible.If you are looking for a swashbuckling tale, this set is for you. Six hours of fantastic stories. If you liked St. Ives, you will love this one..."
2,Stick with the books or the Jane Seymour version,"In France Percy did way too much shooting and not enough thinking. The Scarlet Pimpernel is supposed to be a master of diguise, yet we never saw him don one, instead we got 007 type hidden weapons and accompanying fight scenes. Now I like James Bond, but that's not Percy's style.That said, I really enjoyed the 2nd film, the hints of Chauvelin's past and the delima he ends up facing are simply marvelous... still something's wrong when the villian is the character who won most of my sympathies."
2,The Scarlet Pimpernel Strikes,"Occasionally, I find a DVD set that I cannot finish, and the Scarlet Pimpernel was it. I love the story, adore the book, and liked the old black and white version. I would like to say first, the costumes are terrific, the cinematography is good, but the actors are stuck with questionable lines. That is not to say that the dandies are not dandy and the ladies are not of questionable morrals. I would like nothing more than to recommend this DVD set to friends and strangers alike, but even my Anglophyle friends have not been able to get past the first DVD in this boxset."
5,Scarlet Pimpernal,I really don't know what the person who gave this a one star is talking about! Richard E. Grant is fabulous as Percy and the other actors are superb as well. The set is rich in detail and beautiful to watch - as good as the Anthony Andrew's version.
5,Hell of a Book !!,"Being a fantasy author myself. I look for well written titles that break new ground even on a subject that has been done before. Steven ""DELIVERS!"" a timeless tale with a new twist. A must read!!"
3,Decent overall,Now I was pretty nuetral about this book overall so don't think that I am saying this was a bad book just because I gave it three stars. I liked it well enough but I found that I had a hard time really loving any of the charactors. To many explanations and not enough action was another problem I had with this book. I am ashamed to admit that I had a very difficult finishing this book all the way to the ending which if I remember correctly didn't have much of a conclusion.I would say rent it from a libary but don't nessarily buy this book.
4,Enjoyable read!!!,"I could not stop reading, this enjoyable re-telling of heaven and angels in the beginning of time. I recommend it!"
1,I can't believe the reviews,"I have read several of Steven Brust's books and have never found him to be a good fantasy writer - if you want a good fantasy writer read Katherine Kerr or Stephen Lawhead. [...]It left too many questions unanswered (or ignored). For example, WHY did the First Wave appear? Why were the more complex and powerful angels created first? How could beings who could barely hold Heaven together create suns, planets, and galaxies while simultaneously getting rid of the chaos that had threatened Heaven? Suspension of disbelief is one thing; suspension of intelligence is another."
1,Um... It was AWFUL - Wish I could give it NO stars,"I read this book when I found it. It was a book ""gifted"". That is to say, a book that no one wanted in their house because it was that bad. (We just got gifted with the movie ""Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter"", to give you an idea.) So I am real suspicious of the positive reviewers.The premise could have worked. I have no problem with that. But the writing is so POOR and convoluted that I was gagging while trying to read it. I had no idea to the characters motivations. Even the characters from the 1930s and 1940s Space Operas were better drawn than these characters. I found myself not caring one iota about any of the folks portrayed.Save your money and DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME with this one. If you want good religious science fiction read Octavia Butler."
3,"Good, but...","I certainly enjoyed this novel well enough. It was a very clever idea and Brust pulls off this fantasy version of the Revolt in Heaven with some wit and charm. But it isn't a major work of fantasy by any stretch. A hefty percentage of this novel is dialogue... probably more than 70%. So, while I could recommend it as a fun read, I'm not in the glowing ""five-star review"" camp."
1,Terrible,Rarely have I encountered a book which such a good idea and such terrible execution. When your characters are Yahweh and Satan ( among others ) how can you have zero depth to the characters?
3,"Nice concept, plain writing - slow going.","Burst's story is indeed a prequel of sorts to Paradise Lost, and in its own way is just as difficult and boring a read as the text I tackled as a college sophmore. The writing and plotting are very simple and the book reads more as a well developed outline than a novel - there is little characterization and little exposition and little motivation to warrant the events depicted.Interesting book, but you are better off visiting a library."
2,Lackluster,This book did not live up to any of my expectations. The dialogue was difficult to follow and boring. I would have to say that for such a potentially exciting topic; this book is a real waste of time.
5,Get More Booty!,"The whole album is solid and fun but ""More Booty with Buddha"" is one of my favorite songs of all time! Hints of Tom Waits, Captain Beefheart, Dr. John here. Great guitar growl, and swampy vocals."
1,Mis-represented,"THIS IS NOT AN INSULATED OVEN MITT!! There is a tag on the inside that states ""For Decorative Use Only"""". It would have been nice if this was also stated in the item description."
5,useful,I love my kitten oven mitt. Keeps me from burning myself and also a great decoration piece on my cabinet door.
4,A MUST HAVE TOOL,"You gotta have one of these, it can be used for so many things.Although you may not use it every day it's just one of those little things you WILL need eventually.This is a good quality tool that's well made and will last a long time.The laquer coating has been washed,scrubbed off my tool and when I left some drywall compound on it over night it rusted (seemed strange to me too.)so be aware of that.Two thunbs up on this one. Now get out there and scrape something."
3,good sound but sterile,"This recording has modern sound but everything sounds a bit too easy and too overrefined which makes it ultimately sound slightly sterile. I prefer David Munrow's Susato recording: from the very start you can sense the joy, excitement, slight trepidation that Munrow's band had in playing these renaissance instruments."
3,doesnt even fit...,"ya its good quality i guess and does the trick if i am stuck but the shape of it was not even rectangular! it fit in about halfway, so i couldnt put the pin through"
3,"Good, but not inspired","This CD is one of those that I got interested in after listening to some MP3 clips; I was intrigued enough to plop down my money. The CD as a whole, however, just doesn't have enough depth of inspiration to hold up. It is good, no doubt, but I can't help but feel that these two have spent a little too much time studying Siouxsie and the Banshees riffs. One can hear some Siouxsie-like vocal stylings here, a very Steven Severin-ish bass line there (unfortunately though, no Budgie-inspired quirky drumming: the drums here are unimaginitive and serve only to keep a beat). So my feeling is, if you want this type of thing, go to the group that invented it: buy Kaleidoscope by Siouxsie instead. That CD is a classic, while this one is only adequate."
3,It must be very good...,..the dog ate it. And it actually works as intended...not many electronic things do these days.
1,Frequently cuts off incoming messages,"I've had this machine for around a year. It seemed to work OK at first, but lately it has been cutting off the incoming messages long before the maximum message length. Seems like if the person who is calling you speaks softly, it will cut them off."
1,DIDN'T LEARN ANYTHING,THIS BOOK HAS ONE PAGE PER PSYCHIC PHENOMENA IT PROMISES TO TEACH THE READER. THE WHOLE BOOK IS WAY TOO BRIEF. I DIDN'T LEARN ANYTHING FROM THIS BOOK.
5,Fast & Convenient,"I run a small business and also sell quite a bit on eBay. Most items I ship go into flat-rate envelopes. In the past I would print out USPS Priority postage on a paper and then use a tape-gun to tape it on the envelope. This was fine until I tried these labels. What a difference they made! Not only do I skip the step of taping the postage on AND save the cost of the packing tape that I was wasting, but I am also now shipping what I consider to be a much more professional looking package to my clients and customers.I highly recommend these labels for both convenience and presentation."
5,TrueBlock comes in handy,"I have found that the TrueBlock line of products comes in handy when re-using boxes. Labels from this product line are thick enough to completely cover old labels. They also tend to peel very easily from the sheet, but to stick very securely to packages. I have not had a single label jam in the printer. Finally, they seem to resist wrinkling while being applied to boxes better that any other label I have used.These labels though come in handy in a number of different cases. First, you get a lot of surface area. That has allowed me to include some graphics on labels that just would not fit on standard mailing labels. My labels are now a much more effective communication medium for my brand. These labels will also actually work effectively as mailing label/box sealer for smaller boxes."
3,Good quality but a bit expensive,"These are good quality labels but you can find generic brands for less money and I have never really had a problem with cheaper, lower quality labels.These have 2 labels per page and if you cannot disable a bottom receipt portion from printing out, you will waste a label."
2,peels easily from USPS Priority Mailers.,"These labels are nice quality and print very well from my ink jet printer. HOWEVER, they don't adhere securely to the free Priority Mail Envelopes that are made of Tyvek. They just peel right off. I actually lost a package and believe it was because the label did not stick well. I will have to use tape on the label if I don't want it to peel off. The defeats the purpose of buying these, might as well use plain paper and save the $."
2,Doesn't stick well,"I purchased these labels so I would no longer need to use shipping tape to adhere labels printed on regular paper. Unfortunately, I've found that it is very easy to lift the corner and peel the label off of the surface of the package or envelope. I've used these labels on cardboard boxes, paper envelopes and plastic envelopes - the label does not stick well to any of these surfaces. Often, by the time I get to the post office, the corners of the label are already lifting all on their own. Consequently, I am still putting tape over the label to insure it does not fall off on its way trough the postal system, completely defeating the point of using an adhesive label in the first place, especially one that costs more than the plain piece of paper."
3,allways looks dingy,not happy with it it discolerd looks like you didnt wash it not good quality poor stainless steel wouldnt by again
4,irritated at the cover...,"Good mystery. I sort of had it figured out but its resolution was still satisfying. The only problem I have with the book is the cover. The cover is a composite of a couple of events that happened in the book, but one of them is definitely in the last quarter of the book and I kept wondering when it was going to happen (I won't tell you so as not to spoil it for you as well)."
2,Why do I need so much detail about networking?,"If you are looking to buy a book like this, I would suppose that you know a little about networking. This book spends far too much time teaching what you should already know about networking. There are other books and free how-to's that are specific to networking . I am still searching for a concise book that tells me exactly what I need to know about Samba, not an ""N+ training"" manual. I got so tired of trying to glean out the Samba information I quit reading and gave up. Why do so many Linux authors feel they have to tell the history of Linux again, and again, and again, and.......?"
2,built-in mic pickups up motor/tape noise,I cannot really use built in mic for recording of anything. The mic in my unit pics up so much noise from recorder moving parts that any such recording is too painful to listen to. With a simple (a few $) external mic it works well for me. I do not recommend this product (if you plan to use it with its internal mic).
4,"Terrific recorder, misleading product title","Wouldn't you think a product whose title reads ""with Dual Power Source"" would actually include the AC adapter? Not in this case, although I can order one separately.If you in fact want the AC adapter to arrive in the same package as your cassette recorder, be sure you order the Sony TCM-210DV, which I now understand is the model I should have ordered. The TCM-210DV appears to be identical to the TCM-200DV but includes the AC adapter.Although I don't have the AC adapter I wanted as insurance for the occasions on which I record on tape, the recorder performs just fine on battery. I use it primarily to play audiobooks from the public library, because a Walkman or other play-only motor is not powerful enough for old, worn cassettes."
1,Sony TCM-200DV Standard Cassette voice Recorder,"The only reason I got this was to listen to a book on tape as I drove a long distance, since my tape deck is broken in my car. it isn't loud enough to be heard in the car without ear phones. It isn't legal to drive with head sets on so I had to rest it on my shoulder to hear it. Needless to say, it sucked!"
1,Big start fast end,"I had an earlier version of this Sony cassette that worked well for years. Then it stopped recording, so I replaced it with high hopes. After a week or so, it stopped recording. other people to whom I recommended this had the same experience. I conclude that the quality of this product has degraded over the years. I recommended that friends switch to digital or Iphone or Ipad for voice recordings. The cassettes needed for this Sony also are very difficult to find, so this switch makes sense to me."
4,Great book!,"This book is wonderful if you are a big Tara Lipinski fan. It showed Tara on the ice, at home, and just having fun. I loved every single picture in the book!"
5,Very very fun! Did I mention very?,"Once it settles and there's not much glitter in the liquid, turning it on and watching it start up is mesmerizing. And of course it's pretty while running normally; also, if you have it by a wall you'll get moving sparkles from the reflections. Note that it doesn't put out a whole lot of actual light, so if you're trying to light a room with just these for more than the purpose of say, a very low-level light or the sparkle-show, I'd suggest getting several. And it will be a very reddish-pink light.This thing is worth way more than its price tag and I love it. ^___^"
3,Pretty,"This is very beautiful for a nightlight for my kids, but the glitter doesn't move around very much was a little disappointing."
4,Good night,"This lamp in our opinion is even cooler then a regular lava lamp. Not to bright. Throws some reflections on the walls and ceiling. Not a total room coverage of reflections but enough to sooth you away. Does get a little warm, careful"
3,Numbers hard to read,Lock works but numbers on dials are blurry and hard to distinguish one from another. You could easily stomp this open with a hard kick.
5,The new ecological home,"This books organically combines introductions into various aspects of green home building with practical suggestions, calculations and brief product reviews."
2,Not even close to what's pictured,"When something is too good to be true... This plant is on ""sale"" (@6.99 plus shipping). I got 2 plants in 6"" hanging pots. I don't understand how it's described to be ""blooms constantly"" when what I got are cuttings that are stuck in a pot of soil. They will at least need 6-12 months to even show signs of blooms, if they survive at all. They are 11 4-inch ""short"" cuttings. They look like they came from 3 long vine strands because the ends are obviously been cut. They don't spill out of the pot as shown in the picture. But like I tell myself all the time - you get what you pay for. I kinda fooled myself to think I will get anything close to the picture for $6.99. One of these days I'll learn not to trust the reviews in here."
1,What a piece of JUNK!!!,I bought this item for my daughter. It was in pieces by the end of 3 days. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! Buy the Little Tykes shopping cart. I am surprised Toys-R-Us would put their name on this junk.
1,piece of junk,"We bought this last Christmas, swayed in part by the pretend food that came along with it. Take my advice: skip this cheap piece of junk and spend your money on a cart that holds together and has wheels that actually allow it to be pushed. The front casters are completely worthless; the front seat is too narrow to allow a normal doll to sit in it without sliding out; the plastic cracks with minor pressure. Other ""Just Like Home"" products have done better in our house, but this one was a waste of money."
2,Not such a good read...,"Well, the title and all the editors' reviews made me buy this book without hesitation. But now I know better. This book offers very few insights into the world of prostitution and sex industry. Some stories on the side are very uninteresting. And it keeps the climax building it and when it's time to reveal it, it's wrapped quickly in the last two pages leaving sooo many important questions unanswered. So basically what is written is not as important as what should have been written. I don't recommend."
2,Not what I was expecting,"I was expecting a humorous juicy story about the goings-on of a Manhattan call girl but that's not what this book is about. Instead I got a tale of an engaged prostitute, Nancy, who isn't sure if she wants to get married and let go of her call girl life style.Her future sister-in-law constantly pesters her about her wedding plans and she never says or does anything about it. She's also a district attorney who might be after Nancy. We never really know. Her future brother-in-law may or may not be having an affair with one of her escort friends. We never really know what happens with that relationship either. And the climax of the story happens when there are only five pages left in the book and as a result the plot resolution is really lame. Also this novel is supposed to read like a diary, but who puts detailed dialogue in their journal entries?"
1,No value of any kind,"I read the title and I wanted to get the book cause I thought that such a blunt title might be packing something of value, Intriguing or mysterious may be. All I found were some papers with worthless narration about someone with no morals at all doing anything for money, the main character and her so called friends are simply as the book describes them: hookers.I'm very disappointed that I bought such a book but I should have known better, the title did not lie. I wish that the author had put some effort to come up with a real novel, something of some kind of worth instead of this.I do not recommend it at all."
4,Diary of a Manhattan Call Girl,"For we who are involved in the human experience, this is an excellent work. Regardless of what you think of prostitution as a moral issue, it tells a story about how responsible these professionals can be to each other and to their clients. It is a life work and worthy of the read.It is a little difficult in the reading, because it is truly a ""diary"" not a novel. There is no consistent story and I do not beleive that the author intended that there be a consistent story.Don't look for overt sex here. You won't get an erection from this book, nor will you get any addresses. There are images, but only enough to support the theme. This book is about working girls and their lives. It tells a story about professionalism and the sacrifices of that.I bought the book based on a radio interview with the author. I percieved a very perceptive and cogent person who was very much in charge of herself.It's a good read. Try it unless the topic offends you."
5,Loved it!,"Loved this series. Very well written and performed. We grew more fond of each of the main characters with every episode. After watching the series through Amazon Prime we bought the DVD set so we can watch it again and again. If you enjoyed ""Anne of Green Gables"" I think you will like this set also."
4,My wife has practically worn this out!,"Good quality audio and video, with the episodes themselves really selling this product. Am buying other similar shows as they become available"
5,I guess you could say Lark Rise to Candleford is my one weakness...,"I am not one to turn on the television when company comes to visit, but if they stayed too late on Saturday night while Lark Rise was airing I was sorely tempted.Lark Rise has been so enjoyable for me. I love period Dramas and I love wholesome entertainment with moral values. I love the thoughtful writing. And love it even more that I can watch it with my children whatever their age and enjoy the episodes as a family.This series will be greatly missed and in my opinion the creators have BIG SHOES to fill when they create their next series."
4,color go fish,"After searching for Go Fish cards that dealt with colors, I was excited to find these cards. They reminded me of the cards I played when I was little. Although my granddaughter and I have fun with these cards, I wish they would have used basic colors names to help teach the colors, which was the purpose of my purchase. It's difficult to present colors such as turquoise and chartreuse to a 2 1/2 year old. I was hoping to work on red, green, brown, black, etc. as cafe au lait is not in her vocabulary. So we still use the ""ordinary"" names of the colors when we play, and she does enjoy playing with the fish cards in her own way, so the purchase was worth it."
2,Dvorak has better interpreters at far less cost to the pocketbook.,"I'm listening to this Sejna 5th again, as I write. I was led to buy this album from the 5* Amazon review posted here in 2007 and I'm continuously disappointed in both the performance and the sound. it's easily trumped by Pesek's recent performance with the Czech Phil that can be had used from Amazon for $3.69 (used), as of this writing. I'm deeply committed to reissues across the board and am very tolerant of their sound. I also find central European idiomatic performances congenial. This CD is below par on both counts. My advice is to buy the Pesek first at $3.69 and then, IF you still hanker for something different, go with the Kertesz and only order the Sejna for three times as much if you want to TAKE A BIG GAMBLE.On this disc the Slavonic Rhapsodies get the better performance, but the composite is overpriced for what is delivered. The big appeal will be to those wanting to pursue Sejjna for historical/scholarly reasons."
2,Thought I'd Like It,"I picked up this hose on sale at the Country Bumpkin when picking up some mums, and I thought it was a great idea. After using it a few days it just got all tangled anyway. Probably not their fault as I need a longer hose and I was stretching it to try and get it where it had to go. I still use it, but it isn't all neat coils anymore."
3,"great condition, slow to arrive","The workbook I bought is in very good condition, as advertized. However it took 17 days to receive it. Too long."
3,???????,"If you have ever been curious about self hypnosis then this book would be a good introduction, although I can't say that I would pay full price for it."
4,So far so great!,"I've only used it a couple of times so far, but I've seen and felt results the very next day! I can also ""feel"" that I am actually hypnotized during the sessions. This is worth buying."
2,Watch out!,"NO matter what anyone says, it is physically impossible to upload microphone recorded music onto your computer with any Minidisc player. You can however record music to your hard-drive through an analogue connection, in real time. This not only wastes time, but usually there will be a slight loss in sound quality."
3,The Software the Comes with this is Horrible,"The player itself is great, but if you are going to rely on the player and your computer to write to MiniDiscs, just be warned that the software that comes with this device is very hard to use, often crashes, and is very very restrictive. For example, you can't copy songs off a MiniDisc onto your computer.You've been warned.Ratings:Hardware: 5Software: 1Average and Final: 3"
4,No Regrets,"Best I've found for the money. Bright and versitile. 3 AA batteries.Only complaint (why 4-star instead of 5) is that the multi-function switch has a poor feel and is hard to control. It does not have a clean, discernable operation.Still, this is the one I would purchase and recommend it above all others."
4,good light,"Very bright light on high power, LEDs provide adjustable lower brightness if needed. Buttons to operate lights are quite small and take some practice to find when wearing the light."
2,Low price is for a reason,"These are clearly being sold off at this price for a reason. I bought two. One worked flawlessly, and I'm pleased with it. The second had a faulty switch for its main lamp leaving two choices: ""Off"" or ""Randomly Dim / Flickering / Off"". In reading reviews elsewhere, it seems this is a common problem with the product.So, this amounts to a gamble with your time. If you're lucky, you get a superior product at a low price. If you're unlucky you get to play the return game. I'm doing the latter right now and am hoping that it's a game I only need to play once. If I have to play twice, the two star rating I've provided should really drop to zero."
5,Great Bead Set,I ordered this bead set for my 3 year old granddaughter and she loved it. The beads were the right size for her to handle and the holes in the beads were not too small for her to get the cord through. She had a great time with this product.
1,Get Your Own Voice,"Granted some of the music is halfway decent, but will someone please tell him he is not Conor Oberst. Conor is awesome, Bright Eyes is amazing, this kid needs to just quit now. Drive-Thru is just trying to steal another genre of music. If you want this kid of music, pick up a Bright Eyes record, and for god sakes, check out Saddle Creek."
5,Great performances at a steal of a price!,"Christopher Hogwood's Beethoven symphonies set was originally released in single-disk albums beginning in 1985; hence, from the standpoint of the digital age, they are already ""old"" recordings, which is presumably why they have been released in a bargain box format. It certainly isn't any lack of performance quality that prompted this steal of a reissue. The performances range from very good to stupendous; Hogwood's versions of the 2nd and 3rd Symphonies are particularly fine, and his 9th, while different in respects from Norrington's excellent recording of 1987, is a pulsating, lively rendition in its own right. This is a set to snatch up (especially at this price) even if you already have other recordings of the Mighty Nine."
4,really powerful !,this music may lead you to dark side of the source. please be careful if you are under the light of the supreme being.
5,Must Read,"Jim Rohn was waaaaay before his time...A genius...if you want to learn to get ahead in this dog eat dog world read up on what Jim Rohn has to say...we have lost a truly ""Prophet"" of our time!"
4,one year and...,"I've owned this bike for a year now, and it's been great. You get enough bike for the price. the ultra low gear is great for steep hills, and the rest of the gears are good for the road. I use mine to pull a trailer with both of my children in it and it works great.I have had problems with the derailer switching a gear on it's own, sometimes adjustments are needed between summer and winter (dis-similar metals?)If i had the money I would go to a bike store, but if you are like me and don't have tons of money, get this bike and cruise in comfort and style."
1,Damaged upon arrival - can't return,"I didn't get a chance to use this filter until almost two months after I bought it (thanks to unscheduled surgery). It just sat on my workbench in the original box. Due to exceeding 30 days, I don't have a return option worth considering. Only now did I notice a very significant dent in the bottom of the filter. There is no way I am going to take a chance and put this questionable filter on my new engine.So, I will chalk this purchase up to experience and toss the damaged oil filter into the trash. Anyway, I found the same filter at Walmart for less money and I was able to inspect it before buying it.I buy lots of things through Amazon without any problems. Apparently these filters get some rough handling somewhere along the way. I have three cars I maintain myself but I won't be buying any more oil filters through Amazon. Live and learn. Buyer beware!"
2,Big let-down,"I am a big fan of both Hogwood and Rousset (especially Rousset who I consider to be the best harpsichordist around today with the exception of Trevor Pinnock)- but there are some big problems with this CD. The sound quality on most of it is AWFUL, and the W. F. Bach concerto, maybe the greatest piece ever written for two harpsichords, is played very stiffly. Look for the disc of music for two harpsichords under the Harmonia Mundi label, as well as Rousset's recordings for HM if you want to hear Rousset at his best."
5,This takes you back.,"Close your eyes. The leather chair feels worn, soft. Smoke lingers in the air and candles flicker. Martini glasses clink around you, but everyone is mesmerized by the sultry soprano voice coming from over by the piano.... This CD will turn your livingroom into a 1950's jazz lounge. Classic tunes performed by skilled artists - if Peggy Lee had formal training, she might sound something like this. All of the songs are great, but Peel Me A Grape is superb. A fantastic disk to add to any collection!"
3,"Made in China, not USA as shown in picture.","At the time of my purchase, the picture clearly shows ""Made in USA"" on the sticker, however, after receiving the item it says made in China. Looks decent enough--a bit flimsy, perhaps--but I would have looked elsewhere had I known. Just a heads up, for those who care."
1,Boring,I really wanted to like this book but was so disappointed that I found myself skipping over sections hurrying to get to the end to be done with it. Once I start a book I feel obliged to finish it. I wish I had not started this one at all.
2,Not as pictured,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter and am very disappointed in the item. It is not at all as pictured, but is a dull gold/brass color and completely scratched up. Hopefully form and function are not connected. I won't know until my daughter uses it on her bonsai.Will not order from this company ever again."
3,good clippers,They are a good pair of clippers for a bonsai tree they are one of the best pairs I have bought.
1,Not as pictured,"The sheers I recieved were extremely cheap and lost their edge after a few bonzi uses. the blades rust, the plastic does not hold its shape, and they look NOTHING LIKE THE PHOTO. I would not recomed this purchase!"
5,Good for precision cutting,"Mine is a little different than pictured -- it has a thumb loop on one side, which makes it sort of awkward. However it cuts cleanly and precisely. I use it for buds, leaves and tiny branches that are difficult to reach with larger clippers. It's a sharp cutting tool, good enough for a beginner to moderate bonsai enthusiast."
5,I like this book so much I need another copy!,"I use this book so often as a great reference source that I wore mine out. It has wonderful cross-referencing for the essential oils, recipes, history, uses etc. Jeanne has also included little symbols to alert users to the volatility/toxicity of certain oils as well. The first book I would recommend to someone who wants to get started in this field."
5,Good toy to have...,"My 2-year old has always enjoyed matching and grouping like items, so I thought he'd enjoy this. While he's too young to actually play the ""game"", we make up our ways to match the picture pieces. Just a good toy to have."
1,Not really AAA,"Bought AAA from another company and they were as if they were never used. These so called AAA I bought from Amazon are more like AA or A. Too many marks (scuffs) on ball and also too many used balls with logos. You could by brand new logo balls (over run) at your local golf store for a little more money. I would not of minded if they cost a bit more, but not with so many scarsI would never buy these again."
2,Are these balls Pro VI or Pro VI X?,"Amazon needs to clarify what they are selling here. The picture shows golf balls with Pro VI X on them. Then, the heading turns around and says Pro VI. Obviously, Amazon staff are not golfers. There is a big difference between Pro VI and Pro VI X to golfers. I am not a golfer, but my husband is, and he plays with Pro VI but not Pro VI X. I point this out to golfers because if you look carefully throughout the entire web page, you will find several references to either Pro VI or Pro VI X. If you are particular like my husband, you need to call Amazon first and find out exactly what you are buying."
5,Awesome balls!,"Balls are In great shape! They have Little logos on them but who cares it makes them easier to identify as yours, and saves a grip of coin. I'll buy more after I loose these for sure!!"
2,A mess,"This charmless, even bitter survey of the admittedly overwhelming evidence against purely behaviorist theories of human development is greatly weakened by Pinker's too frequent appeals to the authority of those he agrees with -- sometimes he literally just gives the names of a half-dozen colleagues who agree with him!-- and by his nearly total lack of sympathy for opposing views. As another reviewer wrote, it feels as if Pinker is paying back a few grudges he's been nursing since grad school.Pinker's knowledge of cognitive psychology is of course immense, and the endnotes and bibliography provide an excellent guide to the literature, but as history of science this is naive at best. I would suggest that anyone interested in arguments for innatism begin with Judith Rich Harris, who sticks to what she knows, and writes far better than Pinker does here."
2,What does Pinker mean?,"Neuroscience increasingly helps us understand the biological basis for human perceptions and patterns of thought. Pinker writes about these new findings as part of a nature vs. nurture debate. I am interested in these arguments, but I couldn't understand Pinker's position until I got to about page 200. There is substance to this book, but I had to work hard to understand it."
1,Disappointed Former Fan,"I have read the Language Instinct and How the Mind Works and loved them both. I was expecting more of the same well researched, tightly argued, and engagingly written insights into our species.Frankly, it wasn't there. He frequently diverges into facile and trite philosophy, and makes many of the errors he rails against in the first few chapters. For example, when reviewing Stephen Jay-Gould's book ""The Mismeasure of Man"" he claims the book was written to debunk any theory of innate talent, not a theory that either follows from or is proposed by Gould who focuses more on the denial of the reification of the intellect.Puts the wrong words in others mouths, and pulls the wrong ones out of his own."
5,One of the best books ever,"Yeah, I dont mean to come across the wrong way but i do have a degree in philosophy and i honestly think this is one of the best books i have ever read. Even in light of Kant, Hume, Locke, (Descartes sucks), Aristotle etc... This book does NOT seem to create an original system of philosophical thinking, rather this book is a synthesis of all intellectual pursuits put together, Anthropology, psychology, neurology, philosophy, history, etc... His main thesis is determinism, which in my opinion will be the next revolution in the culture of mankind... Similar to the so called Darwinian Revolution... In a nutshell our brains, more than our environments or so called free will, control our actions...I highly recommend this book..."
2,Still Sounds Like Crap,"Bought this version based off reviews that suggested it sounded much better than the originally issued CD version of the same show. While the sound quality MAY be slightly improved it is apparently, akin to polishing the proverbial turd. Still sounds awful to my ears. 1974 and 1976 live records are much better. This one is not worth bothering with IMO."
4,Good Concert Recording,"A very good concert recording from this progressive rock band.This show highlights the line-up from their hit making days and musically is very good but is plauged by the visual technology of the day.Some very poor visual effects on this dvd,but the music makes up for the visuals.Some good extra feautres also.Enjoy the music and ignore the 70's cheesy effects."
5,thoroughly enjoying this series,Glad i found this Inspector Ian Rutledge Mystery series. i can't wait to move on to the next book. Ian Rutledge is a very interesting character as a person and an investigator and i love the story lines in each book.
2,not that great,"this cd was a disappointment. they play a mostly third wave ska with a tad bit of punk rock thrown in here or there. the only good song by this band is on the everything offbeat volume one comp. that is why i bought this cd and now i feel stupid because this band is not that good. now this band isnt horrible, but i have only listened to this cd two or three times. its a below average cd. if you want good ska go out and get spring heeled jack, the toasters, less than jake, the mad caddies, the ventelators, the chinkees, link 80.... i just gave you plenty of bands to look for so dont buy this cd."
4,Loved it,Well researched....flowing....gripping......page turner....for the X-Files/Profiler fan who misses the thrill of the chase and exquisite detail
2,Adequate but looking for better,"The first small links connecting the key rings to the body of the key chain broke within a couple of days of purchase. So, I just linked the body directly to the key rings without using the link. That took care of that problem.The button that you push to release the valet portion of the key can weaken over time and needs to be bent to reinforce it's ""grip."" Otherwise, your valet key (in my case, the key to my wife's car which she asks for when she loses her own) will slide off over time.So this key chain does the job, but it is a poorly constructed and needs some fiddling with to overcome its flaws. I would not have expected this given its price."
4,Glad to be able to get this book. Thanks.,This made a little boy very happy. Now he wants to be a children's writer when he grows up.
3,Lack of photos mars this presentation of great recipes.,"As always, Bon Appetit offers up recipes that are well-written and delicious. The scope of this book isn't limited to Christmas. If covers the whole holiday season - Thanksgiving to New Years. There are wonderful menus for entertaining in a variety of settings and many supplemental recipes. There is also a section on treats to make for gifts. Unfortunately, there are not many photographs in this book. Especially in a holiday cookbook, pictures are indispensible. As good as a recipe for a special Christmas cookie may be, I want to SEE what the finished product looks like, especially if I'm thinking about giving them as gifts."
3,A Big Ad for Disney,"This book is delightful. Will get you into your upcoming trip to Orlando.I preferred the Unofficial guide, because it has many more tips for a successful trip.Boots"
2,4 DVD movies in one,I liked the movies but it was hard to view them on one DVD. Had some problems with the tech stuff to do it right. I may not be as savy as others.
4,Great Book but....,"I love to make chains and I have been in this hobby during the last year, it is a hobby that requires accuracy and patience...a lot of patience. In my particular case I like to see the results of my work in a reasonable period of time. All the chains in this book are very beautiful, as well as the photos, the instructions are ok too but all the chains are soldered, that means that each ring has to be soldered, it can take 20 or more hours to have one chain finished, depending on how skillfull you are soldering. If you have enough time and are very good in soldering this book is perfect for you. That was not my case."
2,Not as good as Woodman's Drinkwater series,"This book describes a British naval family for most of the 20th century. It starts off strongly with the Battle of Jutland and other naval action during World War I. It then continues the family saga into WWII and beyond. However, once peace descends the story looses it strength and putters out. A man's affair with his grandfather's mistress and a menage a trois add some strange flavors to the last few chapters. It would have been a better book if it had ended earlier.All in all, not nearly as good a book as any of the others in Woodman's Drinkwater series which begins with _An Eye of the Fleet_, which I highly recommend."
4,Wood is good!,These are great to have for custom projects as you can match stain colors and they don't feel/look cheap like plastic grommets do. Fits well and looks good.One wish: that they made a flush / flat version of these as the traditional domed plug (like all other grommets) sticks up a little.
3,Too Much Repetition,"I have greatly enjoyed every Miss Julia book, but in this one there were too many pages taken up with a repetition of ""history"" that we have already read in previous books. If I had wanted to read all that, I would have just gone back and re-read some of the previous books. Please, don't do that to us in the next ""Miss Julia""!"
4,Worth the read,"I am a big fan of JR Ward. Her books are usually well written and always keep you wanting more. The Unforgettable Lady is no different. Although this is more of a PG version of JR Ward's writing, it is still very entertaining and definitely worth the read. I do have to say, I saw the ending coming a mile away but with the usual twists and turns I was second guessing my original prediction. Once again, another novel hit out of the park!!!"
5,An Unforgettable Lady by JRWard,"This was typical JR Ward; it was awesome, The book was in new condition and it arrived very quickly."
4,Answering Machine review,"This was a gift for my father, who just wanted a plain and simple answering machine, which, buy the way, is not east to find these days. This machine is plain and simple. It is easy to set up amnd operate. It is digital , so the sound quality is clear."
3,Works for me - but...,"This machine does in fact have a certain tinniness to recorded messages, which is somewhat hard to understand given the advertised statement that it's a 'digital' machine. I could barely understand one message I received. But I don't really get a lot of messages, so this one-time low cost machine will end up saving me about $100 per year over voice-mail purchased from the phone company.--------Edit a couple years later. I still have this item, and it still works the same as it did when I bought it. I just happened to notice that it is now being sold at around $ 80 (!!) It's definitely not worth that much money. I think I paid around $ 20 for it 2 years ago."
2,Poor Sound Quality,"The outgoing message that I tried to record sounded terrible, so I have to use the default outgoing message. To delete a message you hit the on/off button -- not very intuitive as sometimes it just shuts the machine off if your timing is not right. I've had it for over a year, it works fine, but I'm looking to replace it for something of better quality that's easier to use."
4,great buy,"this thing is a great buy. It gets the job done, is inexpensive, and pretty easy to set up.If your old phone had an answering machine built in, and your new one doesnt, and you dont care for the phone companie's ""voicemail"" service..... this is perfect for you."
4,"Low price, good product",The machine was well priced for what you get. It's easy to setup and has a resonable memory capacity. The message play back sound quality could be better but for the price you can't complain.
4,Do you think you're like John and Lorraine?,"I feel so sad whenever I read the story. I cried hard when I read the whole thing, over and over... I still don't know why I'm crying when I'm reading it every time, but I suppose as you read the book you'll find out that the book is not only a fiction. I feel that this story is actually happening in our world... It's a pity that people don't learn stuff from reading."
4,It wasn't excellent but it wasn't bad either.,I had to read The Pigman for my English class. At first i thought the book was horrible but towards the end it grew on me. I especially liked the ending.I think kids ages 13-18 should read this book and see how you like it for yourself. You can't always go by what another person says.
2,The Pigman Not The Greatest Book In The World,The Pigman is a pretty boring book. But there are a couple good parts in it. I wouldnt recomend reading it if you do not have to.Summary of the book.Two teens that have only three frenids and realy know lives try to take money off this guy AKA The Pigman. And end up feeling bad for him. So they start hangging around at his house all the time keeping him company.Thats pretty much what happens in the book.If you want to know more read the book. I thought it wasnt to good but thats me.
2,Not so recommendable,"In our opinion the book isn't so recommendable, because there isn't so much action in it. Because of that it is sometimes a little bit boring. Moreover don't like books without a happy ending and the Pigman is an open ended story . Also we think that the book isn't about a topic , which interests youngsters at this age . But when you have too much time and don't know what to do , you could read it. ."
2,pigmam,"I read the book called the Pigman.It was written by Paul Zindel.The book was not to bad over all. It was a fast paced novel that was just like real life. I kind of liked it because you could relate to John & Lorrain. Other than that it really wasn't that good. I like action,adventure,and mystery. This book deffinetly wasn't any of them. Another part that wasn't any good is that John and Lorrain say about the same things when they switch off chapters.THE BOMB, Dean"
3,The Pigman Review,"In these few paragraphs I'm going to give you my review over The Pigman. Well,in the beginning it was kind of boring because everything was happening over and over again. I wanted a little more action, some thriller.There was no fluctuation in the beginning. As I progressed through the middle I npoticed it was getting better. When I got to the ending the book was getting great. There was more details in the end that I could imagine. Oh well,lets move on. At the end I got into the book. The Pigman was telling stories of his own. The Pigman went back to his childhood years. I loved the book at the end. It was talking about everything I like. If I could rate this book on a 5 star count I'd rate it a 3. All though the ending was good, this book isn't for me."
2,My Opinion of The Pigman,"I did not like the book The Pigman.I thought the whole book was kind of dull.It repeated itself several times.To me it seemed like the kind of book you would fall asleep reading.In the book the characters were not that intiresting because about every day thay would do the same thing they had done the day before.Also in the story Mr.Pignati was a little bit mentally challenged (example-he talked to a baboon).I did not really enjoy the book The Pigman,so if you like adventure books like me then I think you will have the same opinion as I did."
2,I was amazed that I had to read it for my Leap class.,A book really full of despair and reality. This book reminds me of how many bad things there are in my life. I was surprised that in my advanced reading class I had to read it. It can't be classified as any exact type of book but I do have to give Paul Zindel credit for originality though. Overall I think people are overreacting on the bad content but it is really meant for kids over 13 years of age.It was an ok book to me but I have read alot better ones. This is probably one of Paul Zindels worst books.
2,It was aight!,"This book was okay. It was a little confusing cuz I could never figure out who was talking or explaining things, John or Lorraine. Also if Lorraine explains something sometimes John goes and explains the same thing just in another part of book like a chapter later. It is hard to keep up. The good thing about it is the fact that it tells kids to respect an elder especially if the perosn does a lot for you."
3,"The book was good all in all, but it left you hanging.",The book to me was great. It talks about how two teenagers deal with there day to day problems and encounter a man who makes them feel like somebody cares. I enjoyed it. It was also sad. I encourage everyone to read it.
4,it was good,"I think the author's purpose for writing this novel ""The Pigman"" was to show a reader that everyone has feelings and can easily be hurt. I agree with the message because it has happened to me before. The literary elements that the author handled best were characters and the setting. Paul Zindel told every detail about John, Lorraine and the pigman. He told from where Jhon started to drink and where he is now. He told us where the setting was, and what kind of mood it created. When John was in the graveyard he told us the grave was freshly dug, the stars were shining and the sky was blue. I learned the most from the scene when the pigman cried about Conchetta. It taught me that love is strong, which made the novel a good one but not the best. I think it didn't have enough suspense. The characters were always either talking or either explaining someone or something. It was like the saying ""More talk less action"". I give this book a 3.92345678 but since there only even numbers a 4 stars."
3,Emotional and well written novel,"""The Pigman"", written by Paul Zindel, is a nice teenager novel also for the younger. It is about the friendship between two High School kids and an older man, who they get to know during a hoax they are playing. Because of their bad relationship to their parents, the teens John and Lorraine spend every free minute at Mr. Pignati's house and soon he becomes a father substitute for them. If their friendship will break caused by a lie and Mr. Pignati's secret you can read on your own. I enjoyed reading that well written novel because it is a mix of reality and an imagined part of friendship like it will never be!"
4,This was a great book!!!!!,"Well, this book is for readers ages 12& up. I'm 11, but i read books that are for older people. I would have rated this book 4 1/2 but they didn't have any halves so im just going to say it here.......... I THINK THIS BOOK IS 4 1/2 STARS!!!!!!!! Hehe. I think that it was a very sad story but it was a very well written book. Paul Zindell is a great author. I myself think that Lorraine's mother is a little well, stupid for being like she is. READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!..........or else!!!!!! HEHe"
1,Could Paul Zindel make this book any worse?,"I believe this is the worst book I have ever read. I am in 7th grade now, and this book was one of my assigned summer reading books. It is very childish and does not deserve the reading level, ""young adult."" This book was for babies. There was no descriptive detail that tugged on the reader's mind and pulled them into the story. It took me 1 hour to read this book. Pathetic."
2,My Book Review,This was a ok book. It wasn't my favorite but it wasn't the worst book I have read. It wasn't exciting enough. It was very plain. There were a few funny parts like bobo the baboon. I like John because he doesn't care what other people think. The pigman is really wierd. I am int sure why but he is. Overall this book was decent. That is my opion.
5,35 years later,"I read this book about 35 years ago. It's surprising to me how depressing the plot line is, as it's summarized on-line, since it felt nothing like that. It was a very positive reading and thinking experience and perfect for a high school aged student. And I always remember some of the wonderful little lessons the Pigman taught, such as how to remember a series of items. Go read it if you have a chance, and give it to any young person you know."
4,"I laughed, I cried","John and Lorraine are freshmans in highschool, and good friends. When John isn't setting off bombs in the bathroom, smoking, or drinking beer, he's calling up random people in the phonebook, to see how long he can keep them on the phone. After a rather unlucky day of playing this game, Lorraine has a go at it, and calls up a man by the name of Mr. Pignati. According to the story she made up on the spot, she and John are working for a charity. He offers them ten dollars for their cause, and they two go over to his home to collect it. They find an old, lonely man, and before they know it, a friendship has developed.I enjoyed this book very much. It wasn't my favorite book, and I don't think I'd read it again, but it was well written, and entertaining. I recommend it to people 10 and up (if you'd like to read a very short book). Four stars, surely."
5,The Pigman,"I just finished reading the Pigman and it was a great book. I really do recomend it to many young people. When I got to some good chapters, I just did not want to put the book down! I guess I enjoyed reading this book because it really relates to some people. John and Lorraine didn't like high school and they tell their lives like they really are.I really enjoyed reading ""The Pigamn,"" and I hope you do, too!"
5,"""The Pigman""","""The Pigman"" was a good book for all ages. This bookhad many times which teenagers could relate too, but it also showedthe valuable lessons that followed. In htis book John and Lorraine learned that ""life is what you make it, nothing more, nothing less."" This book was also appealing because of all its little stick figure drawings that went with the games that went on in the book and hte actual childrens handwriting on the desks. This book was very humorous, like when hte rollerbalded out of hte mall not even caring. But it was also very emotional. When John and Lorraine met the pigamn they felt something they had never felt before, love. Then thye got very involved with the pigamn, they got so involved they even hurt him by destroying the place he desired the most. I think it was a great book!"
1,Dumb AND Unoriginal!,"This is even worse than the big long sports story stretching from volumes 3-4, if that's possible. Pretty much this is a corny ""romantic comedy"" type thing. Sound Alita-ish? You're right, it's not. I mean, was Kishiro *forced* to write nine volumes even though he'd already run out of good stories, or what? Anyways, this is SO awful! Entirely unoriginal, the type of story where the girl and guy start out hating eachother, then go all lovey-dovey around the end. Aside from the romance, the *other* story pretty much involves Alita trying to blow people up. Somehow, the author actually managed to make this boring. I'd recommend you buy this book if you're curious as to how such a violent story could be so dull, but otherwise, don't waste your money. If you must, buy Alita #1&2, but don't go any further!"
2,It's okay not great-wait for it in a Bargain Bin/Used book,"My 12 year old son tried to read Everworld, but the first few pages just didn't draw him in, so my mom read it to us all on a road trip. It was a little hard to get into at first but a quarter of a way into we all cared what happened to the characters and wanted to know what happened next. My biggest problem with the book was the blatant product placement, I wouldn't be supprised if Taco Bell and Doritos had paid Ms. Applegate's literary advance."
3,Very Interesting,"I really did like this book. But to much curssing. It's a little confusing and a bit obvious. You could read thins in any other book if all authors had imagination. But it is very...abnormal world, which I guess it's supossed to be. Well anyway it's about David, Jalil, April and Christopher and well of course Senna. They get trapped in a mysterious world, and Senna is missing. Only in this world she is known as the white which. And her friends have to go find her. I would give it a try but would not give it 5 stars."
3,"Aw, come on, K.A.!","Why, why WHY? There's only 30 gazillion books about King Aruthor.I KNOW K.A. has the imagination to make something better! You know, make up her own monsters, diffrent realms (I've been reading fantasy books too much)new kings. It's probably going to be a good book, but (no offense meant) it'll just be a runoff of 'the sword in the stone' or something."
5,an oddly engrossing story,"When I pick up the first Everworld title, I did it because Iwas a fan of Animorphs and K.A. Applegate. With this new series, shecertainly hasn't let me down. Being an older reader (I'm fifteen), I can identify with David, Chris, April, Jalil, and Senna. Their story grabbed me from the moment they were yanked into Everworld and hasn't let go. The descriptions are wonderful, the characters are complex, and the plot is captivating. I have all 3 books and can't wait for ""Realm of the Reaper."" I can honestly say this is one of the best series for teenagers that I've seen in a long time."
5,The best book ever!,The book has kept me hanging on. I am on the 3rd one right now. It has to be one of the best books I've ever read. It is suspenseful and full of twists. This is a book you have to read!
3,Hmm...,"I'm sorry, I liked this book, but I can't help feeling I've seen it all before somewhere. Let's put it this way; a small group of teenagers stumbling across something supernatural, in this case a fantasy world where Vikings battle Aztecs, is not an original concept. Perhaps these teenagers could have been made a bit younger. It's more interesting to see how a younger person would react to that kind of situation instead of the usual ""Er, guys..."", ""Oh, man"" and ""Whoa!"". Also, this may be just my view, but if I'd been grabbed by a huge Viking god with a giant pet wolf and I'd wet myself out of fear, would my companions really find the time between being really scared to criticize me for it? Don't be fooled, I did like the first Everworld installment, and hopefully this motley group of young adults will become more accustomed to the surprises of Everworld and we won't be treated to the usual cliched responses."
2,Mildly entertaining,"If you're looking for great fantasy, look somewhere else. These books borrow cliches from all sorts of other teen fantasies and don't even bother to get their mythology right. They're non-stop action, but there's no resolution at all at the end: it's less a series than a serialized book. I had less problem with the occasional swearing than with the way this book felt like only one chapter, not a complete book."
4,Everworld: Sweeeeeeet,"This book is just the first in a long line of a fantastic fantasy book series. Everworld: Search for Senna is created by best-selling author K.A. Applegate, the creator of Animorphs. I recommend this book to anyone with an active imagination or if they like to be on the edge of their seat, or both. I gave Everworld 4/5 stars. It's an excellent book but it doesn't give you all of the background info."
3,"Good, basic book","This book is a good cookbook for someone who is just beginning to experiment with cooking meat on the outdoor grill. It focuses primarily on indirect cooking methods. The book is easy to read and informative. Unfortunately, the recipes for barbcue are tomato-based recipes, not REAL barbecue like we have here in North Carolina. :-)"
1,compilation of previously published articles..,"about a third of the book is devoted to modification and not restoration.there is no continuity of the restoration process, just various articles on various projects on various years of how to do various repairs...anyone interested in puting power windows in your vw using a certain kit from a certain place?"
1,VW Beetle Restoration Handbook,"In my humble opinion, this book is very misleading in it's title. It indicates on the cover that it is ""How to Restore 1949-1967 VW Beetles to Original Factory Condition"" yet when you open it up you see sections on adding power windows, installing hard-start solenoid, wheel bearing conversion, IDA Carb conversion and brake upgrades. None of this has any relevance to the person wishing to restore to original condition. I was terribly displeased and felt ""taken advantage of"" by purchasing this book. This book is totally useless to me for my original restoration project."
3,pretty good,"The book gives you a lot of good ideas but they don't seem to be anything different than what the BHG website offers. My opinion, check with the website first before buying the book. If you don't find it in the website than I recommend it."
3,Its ok,"I dont like the construction, mine actually got slightly bent from staying in my coat pocket and heat. But then i am a Neurology resident and dont use them too often to care and they are soft enough to use on patients and cheap enough to buy."
2,Won't work as User on XP Home Edition,"Bought the web cam for my kids to video with their Nana. Unfortunately, this product will NOT work unless the user has full Admin rights on the PC. Since my kids only have User permissions in XP Home Edition, the camera is useless. This ""feature"" was confirmed by Logitech's technical support. I wish I had known this before I bought it."
2,I was not impressed,"I was expecting a great deal more from this book, especially since I myself was born Jewish. However, I found the characters to be unlikeable, the plot unbelieveable, and the setting (the most interesting part to me) not at all well delineated."
4,runs short,nice casual pant that could even be dressed up a bit with the right shoe and top but the length is short for my 32 inch inseam. if you are looking for something that might actually slim you or take you down a size these aren't it. the pant is good for a smooth look but you will still look the same size as you always do.
4,Works well,"It is really handy and the front makes a great surface to write on if you're not using the lined paper inside. I also haven't had any problems with the binding or the side binding tearing as the material seems pretty durable. However, I only use this moderately and do not use it everyday."
1,Horrible,"I wore these shoes for a week before pieces of rubber from the bottoms starting coming unglued. They also claim the gel feels great, great for walking, etc., but this isn't the case. Save your money and buy insoles and a decent pair of shoes!"
5,Lucian and Brynn-SPOILERS,Favorite scene with Brynn-Going to the fair to see the Gypsy.Favorite scene with Lucian-Getting a confession out of his employee.Together-Brynn's confession of what has been going on with her brother and the conflict in the cave.
1,Don't Desire This,"I wonder if I should rate this book? especially since I am trying to get rid of it. OOPS I mean sell it. This book was so boring I had to force myself to finish. (I believe in finishing what I start) The plot was really weak, The 2 main characters said I Love you so much at the end I wanted to ----. Also N.J.doesnt even tell you at the end if the hero catches the mystery spy or who the mystery spy really is. I am 16 yrs old and the only reason I can see someone liking this book, would be the sexual scenes or maybe the caring of ones family. This is my first N.J. book, sure hope the others are better."
4,Great overview,"Laura's Rose is a really great overview of the life of Rose Wilder Lane. Of course it is more of a booklet, so you don't get a great wealth of information, but still it brings up lots of details things that dedicated Little House fans will find interesting."
1,This book is a waste of money,"This was a required text for one of my classes and I've read almost every page of it. Trust me when I say that you can find a more informative book for a lot less money! This is a very basic book that briefly covers the fundamentals of computing. If you are interested in learning something valuable, try ""Connecting with Computer Science"" by Greg Anderson, David Ferro, and Robert Hilton."
2,"Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah.....",I'm sure that Ms. Page is a very nice person but her writing reminds of people who don't know when to be quiet. She may have some very insightful and interesting things to say but you would never know because you've stopped listening (reading) a long time ago. Not worth the time and effort.
4,delightful bed-time reading!,"I often laughed out loud at the author's self-awareness of lessons learned the hard way! For insight into the inner workings of an artist who never expected to start off by selling her work in the Smithsonian, this is the book to read! What would have made it five stars would be more pictures and better editing!"
4,Fun and Insightful...,"Fun and insightful, Gloria Page has much to offer the entrepeneur of home business'. Although hers is a story of an arts home business, much of what she offers carries over into the arena of home business in general. Her stories teach you the business in a way that makes you feel up to the chanllenge. She makes you feel as if you have a friend to guide you; she shares her ups and her downs; she encourages you at every step. Not your regular how-to book, but so, so much more. A wonderful book for a 1st time writer. A must have for anyone thinking of starting a home business."
3,Disappointed,"I was expecting it to come with preprinted days of the week labels. It's OK, but plastic is fragile and hard to line up threads when putting lids on and taking them off. However, I really like the tower style, as it takes up less space on a shelf."
5,Dino's,"Added this to my collection of dinosauers! Great product, excellent customer service and awesome price and seller. Thank you ever so much for the excellent customer service!!Keep up the good work!"
2,It WILL score the glass but...,"If you're looking for precision, I would go with a pricier model. I keep the blade properly oiled, used it on some 1mm thick plate glass, and used several breaking methods from breaking ""on the ball"" to using the table edge to running pliers. About 50% of the time I'd get a decent, clean cut, but most of the time it's iffy. Might have different results with thicker cuts of glass, but in my art, I prefer thinner pieces, and more precision when it comes to straight cuts."
4,Pretty good,"I got this cord as it is supposedly a little beefier than the Canon version and just little bit cheaper. The cord is very well made. It works about as well as one could expect out of the Canon flash system. It is well worth getting the flash off your camera if you can't bounce flash. The cord is really stiff, which makes holding it out difficult while trying to run the camera, but I knew it was beefier when I bought it."
2,"Good Idea, Poor Design",The idea for this product is great. The problem is with its design and/or choice of materials regarding the buckles.The buckles are plastic and as such they bend and flex. This caused one of the buckles to regularly separate when any weight was applied to the strap as the outer teeth were not rigid enough to stay in place. They instead tended to bend towards the center of the male end of the buckle causing it to slip out of the female end of the buckle which then caused the car seat to fall off the luggage.If another material had been used for the buckles or another type of buckle or fastener was used this product would have been perfect.
2,Better than nothing?,"I bought this in anticipation of a solo flight with my 17 month old. It was hard to pull while walking backwards, but utterly impossible to push or to pull while not watching it to make sure it stayed absolutely level. I won't be using it again."
5,Works great,"I spent lots of time with old ethernet/parallel print servers that wouldn't quite work with GDI and other low cost printers.I was skeptical that this would work.I was impressed that this print server worked with an easy 5 minute guided setup on my Minolta 1250W GDI printer.The range of the wireless (Im using B, not G) is fine (covers whole floor of large home).This device is an excellent solution for putting 2 USB printers anywhere you want them without dealing with the 16ft limitation of USB, or having to run any ethernet or parallel wires.(I don't have to cut and run any wires in my new home). Plusyou get added bonus of having a normal cheap ($100~) printerbecome a networked printer for all to share. (and you don'thave to have the original host computer on to print, as youwould with USB.)"
1,Compatability Is A CRAPSHOOT!,"I bought this printserver together with a Belkin wireless router. I have two printers, a Cannon i900D and a brand new HP Deskjet 5740. The Cannon i900D works through the printserver. However, after about 10 hours of frustration, including 5 telephone calls with Belkin Tech Support, I was finally told (by a level 3 technician, whatever that means) ""Well, I guess this printer just isn't compatible""!! The problem is, Belkin has NO IDEA what printers are compatible. Their website contains two lists - compatible printers and incompatible printers. Both are out of date. I can't find a single inkjet listed on either list that is still commercially available. Belkin tech support has no updated information on compatible models.So does the product work? Maybe, if your printer is compatable. Problem is, noone knows if it is until after you buy the product and spend hours trying to set it up. Which, as I'm sure everyone knows, is immensely frustrating."
1,Did not work!,"Do not spend your money, I bought it, and I took it as it was recommended but nothing happened. I feel very disappointed."
2,Temporary fix,"This is kind of like a flea deterrent. Basically, it makes them move to the other side of the room and they will be back, serving as a very short-term temporary quick fix. I recommend an exterminator and Advantage or Frontline flea treatment.The good thing about this product is that it doesn't smell bad and it's cheap. If your exterminator isn't scheduled to come over until next week and you have guests coming over tonight- use this on and around your couch. That's about all it is good for. In the long run it is ineffective."
3,For lack of alternatives,"If you're looking for something to:a)fit in a cabinet too small for a decent size widescreen.b)be ""future-proof"" w/ built in HD tuner (even though NOT HD tube).c)hold you over during TV technology shake out and price drops for a couple of years.....then I guess this TV is good enough. The picture is just okay. I had a 15 yr old JVC w/ a better picture. The tuner is sooo slow. You better know what you want to watch because ch. surfing on this baby is painful. But for 480 bucks it'll due ok for a couple of years.... then it's off to the bonus room w/ the kiddies for this unit."
1,Amazon sent the wrong product,Amazon sent me the 32F46 not-flat CRT TV. They would not honor the price they advertised for the 32DF46. I didn't want what they sent me.
1,A dud.,"I wanted to show students an informative guide to the building, and this dvd was very unhelpful; the narrative explains very little about the building. A dud. I would actually like to return it; not sure I can, but will check the policy."
5,Best music documentary,"I've been a fan of Fishbone since 1983 and consider myself a ""Fishbone Soldier"". Everyday Sunshine is one of the best rock and roll documentaries ever captured! 10 stars!!!!!!!!! The personal interviews of the band members reveal a genuine story and really show you what it's been like for each of them to be a professional musician ... the good, the bad and the ugly sides of it too. My personal favorite parts of the documentary are the persimmon story and Flea's compliments of the band."
3,"It's OK, but I don't like the ""funny"" pictures.","The book has good info on improving one's health. I would prefer something other than the sketches interspersed throughout the book. I wish the book was laid out slightly different for ease of finding info. I really fund the drawings distracting and not at all helpful, though probably most people would find them amusing."
2,I've seen better,"You: Staying Young Workout (DVD)I am a dedicated fan of the doctors, but was very disappointed in this video. The exercise instructor seems like more of a drill master although the exercises and beneficial. I have learned Qi Gong from a professional teacher and felt that instructor did not understand the CONCEPT behind doing Qi Gong and the energy created, but was merely going through the forms for ""exercise"". I can do better on my own, thanks."
5,It's one of BsB's best songs yet.,It's one of the Backstreet Boys best songs to date. It shows that they really do love their fans and appreciate evrything that they have done for them. It has awsome beats and has non-stop drum beats
1,Waste of time,"Oh dear! I am so glad I checked this out at the library rather than buying it~ I was expecting a good serial killer thriller with college prfessors and a great plot; just this artsy weiting, no plot, no grisly murders, no baffled cops, no real story. Too Kafkaesque. I was expecting a good read like Mark Zubro'a Nick Hoffman series. Fine if you like this sort of thing; NOT for me."
3,Not as clever as it thinks it is,"'The Horned Man' is a psychological thriller about a college professor who starts to feel that mysterious characters are trying to frame him for various crimes.The book is well written and tightly constructed; maybe too tightly. The relatively simple story isn't really enough to keep readers guessing all the way to the end. In fact, many will see the ""twist"" coming from page one.It's not original, either. The device of telling the story from inside the mind of an increasingly unreliable narrator feels derivative.As a satire of political correctness, it's pretty much spot on in its depiction. Many readers will recognize the dilemma of agreeing with the principle but being frustrated by the excesses of PC-ism. However, the satire is not particularly funny and therefore ends up as a failure.Fifteen years ago, 'The Horned Man' might have seemed fresh and clever. Now it just feels behind its time."
2,Very odd!,"Like one of the other reviewers of this book, I was also ""left scratching my head""! I found that I was drawn in at the beginning but as the story wore on I was hoping more and more that the end would provide some clarification as to what exactly the story was about. Not quite the page turner I was expecting and I found by the time I reached the end I was baffled and unsatisfied. I didn't like the story but it was beautifully written."
1,Wrong Size-had to return,I was give incorrect info as to the size of these boots. They were not what I needed.
1,step guard review,Very dissapointed in theseDid not meet my expectations they are flimsy cheap lookingAnd should have sent them backHope this helps
2,"Nice Binder, but damaged it tryting to remove label","I have to say I am not at all happy with my purchase, and would be returning it if they weren't charging me to ship it back. My item arrived slightly damaged, which was a bummer, but I could live with it. What I can not live with is that fact that it took more than 40 minutes to remove the labels from the outside of the binder. I couldn't actually get it all off and was left with adhesive residue all over the binder. When I tried more vigorously to remove the adhesive I scratched the leather cover leaving a huge gouge in it.:( It looks awful and the exposed adhesive is collecting dust and dirt already. I would say skip buying this online and go into a craft store to see it in person and make sure the label will come off."
4,Jr. Police Officer Costume,"My 5-year-old grandson absolutely loved this! He felt he looked like a real policeman. The only problem was the size. I ordered a size larger thinking he would need to grow into it, but it was tight even though he is small for his age. He had fun for a few months until the costume no longer fit. I suggest ordering larger than the actual size of the child you are buying for."
3,Missing item,"Costume is cute and good quality. However, the CAP is missing and so are the items for the belt. I don't careabout the baton and stuff, but the cap is really important. Really hard to get a hold of anyone.Called the manufacturer and they say to contact Amazon. Really hard to get in touch with anyone.Here's description of what comes with the outfit:Realistic policeman outfitUtility belt includes plastic baton, handcuffs, and radioOne piece jumpsuit, though it looks like shirt and pantsCap with badgeGet Real GearAll we got was the jumpsuit and belt."
2,Didn't get what I ordered.,"This didn't come with the items I was told would come with the costume. I didn't receive the cap, the handcuffs,baton or radio. I had one disappointed boy."
3,Cloud Nine addresses many controversial issues in society.,"Cloud Nine addresses the issues of bisexuality, incest, child pedophilia and racism affecting society. Churchill's main focus is to make these issues known and force the reader to understand the importance of them. Although the book may be explicit at times it is still very entertaining. I personally enjoyed this book and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for an eye opener into society."
4,Excellent Study in Alienation,"As far as Brechtian plays go, Churchill is a master at alienation and disidentification- characters in this play are played as the protagonist's projection of who he thinks they should be (ie: the westernized African servant is played by a white actor). Although the effect is extremely powerful onstage, particularly when it raises up complex social and ethnic issues, the different characters can be hard to keep straight on paper. This play works far better in performance than it does in print, but it remains a valuable teaching tool for both Brecht and World Theatre studies."
3,shocking,"This play is a shocking, in-depth look at the way Caryl Churchill describes homosexuality, women's issues, racism, and incest. If these are topics you normally shy away from, this may be the opportunity for you to be rudely awakened. There is humor in the play, but a lot is missed by reading the play - some of it needs to be witnessed."
5,Perfect story for sharing your faith with children,Good for all ages. This is a classic. My children love reading this and it ignites good questions for bedtime talks.
1,"How about getting on the ball in Security, Intuit?",In the year 2006 it is INSANE that we as IT pros still have to hack registry hives to get this software to run as a limited privilege account to better secure our computers.QuickBooks Community - Running QuickBooks 2005 as a Restricted User (Admin Rights FIX):http://www.quickbooksgroup.com/webx?14@@.eeb323b/9When will quickbooks begin to code in a secure manner? Peachtree does. Microsoft Small Business Accounting does.Why does Intuit require updates every few years and acts like we are still all running Windows 98 machines?Security is important these days. How about stepping up to the plate Intuit and getting with the other vendors?
2,On the subject of milking a dead cow,"This book is insanely expensive considering the fact that much of its content is a decade old. There's not much in it that isn't fairly well covered in the free documentation these days, but there are a lot of things in the free documentation that aren't covered here at all, so why bother? Sure, it's great to wax nostalgic about the time when MacTech was a relatively relevant industry rag and everybody shelled out money for copies of the Think-C Reference Library, but things change quickly in the world of computers, and this thing is an absolute dinosaur."
2,The Title Should be Very Basic Indian Cooking,"This is by no means a comprehensive or interesting book. Most of the veggie recipes are variations of ""to the cumin or mustard seeds, add turmeric, veggies, coriander powder and cook until done."" I believe it is targeted towards people of non-Indian origin, however it does little hand-holding. The lack of pictures is lamentable. The glossary/index towards the end is useless. For example if you wonder what to do with the fenugreek powder or fennel seeds in your pantry, the index does not cross-reference the actual recipes that uses them, it merely points to their description on page 38. I was a new bride will zero culinary skills (but a sophisticated Indian palate), and my husband and I outgrew this book within weeks. I would not have purchased this book at a bookstore."
2,Disappointing,"Although I really love this series I was disappointed with this particular book. The story was unfocused, the characters underdeveloped and I never came to care for or about them. I read previous books in the series long into the night. I labored to get through this one. I also would like to see less dependence on the Hamish storyline. Ian Rutledge is a strong enough character to stand on his own. I sometimes find Hamish an intrusion rather than an addition to the interest of the book. I'll continue to read through the series and am hoping the next installment will be an improvement over Watchers of Time."
5,What a great album!,"I was pleasantly surprised by this double-cd. Usually on these type of compilation albums, there are the super-hits and songs that could be considered ""fillers,"" but this CD has no fillers. All 40 of the songs are great, even the ones I was not familiar with. This is one of the best purchases I've made in a while. Great songs, great artist, good price. What else do you want? I strongly recommend this CD."
1,Unreliable,"I bought this in March (8 months ago). I did the research and saw the poor reviews, but I couldn't find an affordable hard drive that didn't get a fair amount of poor reviews so I risked it. A week ago, the drive's file system became corrupted so I could not access any of my files. I bought a program for $50 that fixed that problem (EASEUS Partition Table Doctor) and then backed up all my files to DVD. Today, the computer wouldn't recognize the drive. By looking at other reviews, I found that the solution was to cut off the power to the hard drive and then power it up again. Now I have a functioning hard drive, but for how much longer? Two problems in a week does not inspire confidence. I bought the hard drive to store files (particularly photos) and it works (so far) but NEVER rely on it as a backup system - assume it will let you down."
2,Doesn't wake up after sleep,"I've owned this drive for 8 months and mainly use it with my MacBook Pro. I've partitioned and formatted it without any difficulties, however whenever I unplug the firewire cable (after dismounting the drive) and it goes into sleep mode, it never wakes up again. The only way I've managed to work around this is to unplug the power cable and plug it back in which becomes annoying after a while. In addition to that I only found out that the firewire and USB connections are on separate modules after purchasing it, which requires removing one and attaching the other one to use the two different interfaces. I don't do that often, but it's still another inconvenience. I've purchased, used, and recommended various Seagate drives before, unfortunately this one seems to favor looks rather than functionality and therefore don't recommend it to others."
1,"Becomes invisible, Pure Garbage","At first i was dazzled by the fancy orange light, so i uploaded about 100 gig of material. Let it sit for about 6 months, check on the material and update: they were still there, no problem. the next day, it stopped communicating with the computer. turn off-on the computer, it re-communicated, then simply disappears again. 12 hours later, and many attempts to make it reappear were futile. it starts, it ticks every 45 second for about 5 minutes, then sits there, useless, silent, but still glowing orange. A week later, still the same. Stay as far as you can from this imposture!!"
2,Unreliable,"I have a 120GB and 360GB Seagate. The 120 GB worked really well for about a year and then suddenly the files started corrupting. Figuring I had done something to it to make it do this, I replaced it with a 360GB. Within a week the 360GB started corrupting files, and giving me 'serious error' messages - restarting itself, and not allowing me to save data. I back up my data in a number of files, but still managed to lose a day's worth of work on my PhD thesis and an entire endnote library. I used to think Seagate was a worthwhile brand, but not any more."
3,Heavy stuff,Overall good. But heavier than expected. I feel I should have gone for the HP 300GB stuff as the extra 200GB is not going to make big difference for a user like me.
3,"USB, Firewire just fine, stay away from eSATA","The drive has worked well on the USB and Firewire interfaces. Unfortunately, I really wanted the eSATA speed. I actually purchased a PNY PCI eSATA card and cable at Best Buy (an additional $65 expense) just for this purpose. The drive was recognized by Windows XP Pro over the eSATA connection no problem. I transferred several video files of 15 to 20GB in size. But the transfers were relatively slow, not really any better than the Firewire interface. Seagate Tech Support (how do they manage to have an Indian accent through email?) keeps telling me my card must be eSATA, even though it IS eSATA, so no joy there.I've since read many accounts of difficulty with the eSATA interface on this drive on various controllers, far too many for me to consider this drive a good bet. That's too bad because I really liked it until I found that out. I love the look and feel of the thing.So consider yourself warned if you plan to use it for the eSATA interface. Good luck!"
2,There are much better options,"Enclosure so flimsy that base broke from tower first time we transported it. I'm sure the drive is fine, but you can find much better secure enclosures."
1,The Worst Hardware We've Ever Owned,"I own a full-time digital photo studio and make my living with it. I had numerous USB hard drives holding my data - in different models, sizes, and capacities. I wanted something that was standardized in physical size and capacity, and something nice-looking for my desktop. On the advice of a local techie guru, I bought seven of these drives to handle all of my data. Over the next 18 months, SIX of them failed... half just up and died, and in the other half it was the plugs that physically broke when we unplugged and replugged the drives while moving them to dust the shelf. From my examination of the units after the broken plug incidents, I came to see that the build on these drives is at a level of Chinese toys. These drives have caused us great frustration and lost productivity. I cannot say enough to warn you away from them. (On the contrary, I've had great luck with ugly Fantom drives from TigerDirect.)"
2,Software is a DOG,"Runs fine, does get warm, I can't tell if it's writing to the drive via the lights-- the amber light doesn't appear to do anything.Now for the problem-- the Autobackup software. It has been nothing but trouble.1) When the drive is connected it doesn't initiate autobackup on one of my computers, rather an additional ""backup plan"" must be created. Tech support couldn't solve the problem.2) On the second of my computers not only won't it initiate a backup when connected, when a new plan is created it continuously says ""No backup plan detected"" and cannot backup at all using the software. Tech support was unable to solve this problem either.As a result ALL of their award winning software has been uninstalled and it works fine as a ridiculously overpriced drag and drop external hard drive.Disappointing."
4,A different type of horror movie,"Laura Baxter has a rare medical condition that keeps her in a dream state nearly all of the time. Danny Sloan is an art student that falls in love with the sleeping beauty. He wants to sneak her out of the hospital and show her what life has to offer. He doesn't realize yet that mesmerist and mass murderer has his eye on her, and will stop at nothing to get her back and destroy Danny's life for taking her.This movie is very strange. It has a very likable hero and a very unlikable villain. The suspense and drama in this film is very good. The nightmares that the killer creates are vivid and very creepy. I haven't seen many horror films like this one. I strongly recommend this movie to any fan of the horror genre."
1,Great product ... horrible company,The product is awesome. Works excellently. My atempts to contact the company for some assistance have gone unanswered. Product is great ... company is horrible. Good luck
2,"Narrow view of ""future"" U.S. Naval life sinks book.","Being in the Navy has given me a unique insight into one of the main characters of this book: a United States Naval Officer. It seems as if the author believes that only Naval Officers, not Enlisted, have any brains. Tom Cool could make a living writing manuscripts for the television show ""JAG"". The movie, ""Crimson Tide"" gives an inaccurate view of true shipboard life. Would the second-in-command of a nuclear submarine rush into and put out a galley fire? Hell no! I'm tired of movies that portray ""Officers"" as invincible supermen. I call it ""Top Gun Syndrome"". ""Secret Realms"" is the literary equivalent to ""Crimson Tide"". I am also stationed in Japan, which is numerously mentioned in the book. I don't even want to mention how the author mangled the ""future"" of the Japanese people. Overall, I wish this book had been kept in a secret realm."
4,"Very, very cute movie!","I normally do not care for these Hallmark/ Lifetime type of movies. However, this one really surprised me! It's very cute, has a great cast and leaves you feeling happy. :)"
3,somewhat helpful,"I bought this book because we will be using the Disney Dining Plan on our vacation. For those who don't know, it is a pre-paid meal plan that gives you one counter service meal and one sit down meal each day at a multitude of Disney Restaurants. I found the guide somewhat helpful but not as detailed as other guides or websites. It is a nice small size, so if this is the only guide you purchase, it would be easy to take along on your trip (and even into the parks). I don't understand the need to include recipes in the book, the space could be better used to expand the descriptions. All in all, helpful and compact, a great carry along on vacation. If this is the only book you buy, I would check out other restaurant descriptions too."
3,Lacking information,"I am a Disneyphile. Everything to know about Walt Disney World, I know. I looked at this book for friends visiting from Europe, but decided to pass on it for two reasons. First, most of the information is available in the full Birnbaum guides. Second, and most important, was the lack of information regarding times. It is not enough to say B,L,D for service times. Many people do not eat meals at ""average times"" when visiting theme parks because they hope to catch a break on lines for rides by waiting. Unfortunately, this book doesn't give any indication of when the eateries begin and end meal service. That type of information is truly lacking and very easy to include. For that reason, I can't give this more than 3 stars."
4,Must have for Journey fans,To me there is no Jouney without Steve Perry. This concert shows what a great singer he is. Journey was at their best. Only complaint i have is that the cameras move way around to fast from bandmembers. This is a must have for Journey fans.
4,Journey out and get this,"As a devotee of Journey and Steve Perry, I just had to get this. It does not let you down; all the hits are there. If there is anything less than perfect, it is stage presence. Steve Perry was one of the top 10 male vocalists of the rock era. On the other hand, when it came to stage presence, he never could produce the charisma, the outrageousness, the excitement, of other lead singers. As a result, when you see the album, you will say, wow...what a great voice...but not sense anything more than just hearing the same piece on radio."
3,Only fair sound and video quality,"The published reviews of this concert disk claim overall good to excellent sound and video quality - I did not find this to be the case. The sound and video quality on my disk were only fair, and quite disapointing overall. If you intend to watch this on a system with high quality sound and video, you also may find this disk to be disappointing."
2,Release the series!,A plea for the series release! This was a fun show from the 80's and would be fun to own.
1,Do we have to go thru this again!?,"What a trivial, superficial little recording! If you want mambo music,look elsewhere. I can highly recomend Paris Combo as a true benchmark of euro-jazz."
1,Skip It!!,"Other than the first track, which has terrific appeal, there isn't much here to recommend this album. In fact, it's just bad. The first, fifth, and ninth tracks are much the same, just with slightly(!!) different lyrics, and frankly there are better places to find really good Mambo. This album reminded me of Janet Jackson's The Velvet Rope in what it was trying to achieve. But where Velvet Rope was an interesting album, with its excellent music, spoken word and other effects, A Little Bit Of Mambo lacks depth and never develops beyond the commercial appeal of the first cut."
1,Who really likes it?,"I think anyone who rated this album 5 stars, is a bit out of it. Mambo is a cool song, but as for the rest of the album, who really likes it? I sure don't and I don't know anyone who does."
1,Overplayed!,"Ok, ""Mambo No. 5"" has a catchy tune, and so do all of the other songs. But that's it. They all sound alike. The lyrics are mindless and repetitive. And in my opinion, they have ZERO artistic merit. This is the GAYEST, most AWFUL album i have heard since Snow's ""12 Inches of Snow."""
2,A little bit of mambo? Has Lou Bega even heard REAL mambo?,"BTW for those who are unaware(just as i was two days ago) Mambo 5 is a cover, not original. I like the song, dont get me wrong. My dad pulled out an album by Perez Prado. On the album what should appear but mambo 5. So I put on the record and I came to the realization that Lou Bega watered down all the mambo and fenced himself in using the same old electronic-hip-hop beat to begin and break up the song for the sole reason of making it generic enough so r&b and hiphop listeners will like it. Mambo should sound like mambo, polka like polka, and swing like swing. Everyone, right now, search for Perez Prado, he blows Bega away. Plus there is a song that is one of the best i have heard in a LONG time. It is called Que Rico es Mambo. The trumpets Bega's version sound dead. Prado's(despite ancient, 45 years old,(at age 16 45 years is an eternity) recording quality) sounds like someone is getting paid 1 dollar for every note."
1,If I could take away stars I would,"Sure Mambo #5 is catchy tune, but the whole album sounds the same. It seems like he had one sound/song and somehow convinced someone to waste thier time and record a whole album. If you want #5 just get the single it would be cheaper and most likely sound the same."
3,Fun...Up...Happy...for now anyway,"A nice selection of happy music with some great danceable, move-to, rythyms. I'm especially fond of Mambo #5. It's a cute piece that even the little kids enjoy listening to :) My neices and I play a ""game"" and insert our own names into the lyrics. What's even more appealing to them, is recognizing the already familiar names of friends & family :) They grin ear to ear! It's worth buying just for the priceless reaction of the kids :)"
1,"Great, Exciting, Beautiful","This cd is great. Yeah, great for the bin. It's exciting and upbeat, like studying history. Oh, it's so beautiful, like a hazy and smoggish day. This cd is empty, meaningless and irritating. What is this? I cannot understand why people around me are singing Mambo No 5. I think the song is crappish, sucks big time and childish, ie, ( a little bit of XXX by my side...). I borrowed the cd from my friend and was utterly AMAZED at it crappishness. Definitely not worth your money!"
1,Why don't they just use the real beats instead?,"Of course, They can't do that because that would require them to get permission from all the labels/artists that these beats originally came from. So, We're stuck with another batch of embarrassingly bad imitations of great beats. Had all these beats been the originals instead of these stupid wanna-be's, This would've made a solid instrumentals collection for rappers and dj's. All i can say is: I would've loved to've used ''Westside Story''......"
5,Wonderful True Story of Eliza Jane Wilder,"This is a wonderful book about a strong pioneer women. She was also the school teacher and eventual sister in law to writer Laura Ingalls Wilder.These are Eliza Jane's own words edited by historian of the Ingalls/ Wilders family William Anderson. When you miss out on this book, you are truly missing something.Eliza Jane was truly a liberated woman before women even thought of it. She also greatly influenced Laura's daughter Rose Wilder Lane. Rose lived with her through the last 2 years of high school since she could graduate to the 12th grade in Louisiana where Eliza lived. Very very different from any misconceptions you may have of her."
2,Boring,I couldn't wait for this story to end. The two characters Stone and Annie were boring and dry.
4,"Yeah, but, where's the anger?","This is, make no mistake, a great recording; no regrets about the purchase. The lyrics are as well thought out as the best stuff from Bad Religion. It's just that I'm used to hearing stuff from these guys that comes across as blind seething rage about issues they cover in their songs (try listening to ""Waste"" from Ballads From The Revolution). So, when they sound like NOFX or the Descendents (both bands that I love, by the way), well, that's all well and good, but, it's not really the west coast hard-core punk sound that they have been labelled as representing. All their albums seem to have a couple of songs with a similar sound as is more prominent on this recording. Those songs are also slower and thoughtful while still clearly punk rock. Another reviewer correctly described this as a very good ""punk pop"" recording and, sadly, I'd agree. Hopefully, however, that comment will make the band cringe."
1,Very Poor Design,"The first problem was turning this thing on, the second is turning it off- both require a lot of patience. The power button is awful, terrible, horrible. The unit seems to decide when and if it wants to function. We threw it in the garbage after less than two months."
1,Warranty replacement bad too - flawed design,eSATA connector doesn't work with 2 out of 3 chipsets I've tried. Unit turns itself on and off while it's in use. Runs very hot while on. Base is very hot even when off unless you unplug it.I managed to get my data off of it and get warranty replacement but it is doing the same thing.Don't waste your money like I did.
1,"Stay away, far away. 2 drives didn't last a year, eSATA could not be made to work","I bought two of these about a year ago. They look pretty, but...Drive 1 & 2: I got these for eSATA speeds. eSATA could not be made to work (Seagate technicians agreed)Drive 1 & 2: They run incredibly hotDrive 1: Failed in a few weeks, rec'd replacement.Drive 2: Failed after 9 months (disk crash)Drive 1: Failed mysteriously today (you can see the small internal light registering the attempt to start, but the drive does not start up)To add insult to injury, I did not pay attention (my bad) to the fact that these drives don't have power switches (they have a press area to start them if they quiesce) and, since they are not recognized as ""on"" about half the time, I had to use the power cords to stop/start them so that they would be recognized upon power-up.I am so irritated I don't even want replacements. My more recent large drives are Iomega - go there instead."
5,Like Everything Except the Lights,"I've had this external hard drive for over a month now. No problems whatsoever. It doesn't run hot (just warm to the touch) and its pretty quiet. I very rarely hear anything out of it.The FreeAgent software is the best thing about it. No more incremental backups as in the past. FreeAgent scans for all changes in your ""My"" personal folders (My Documents, My Music, etc.) and backups up those changes in the background so that you are always current. Google FreeAgent for all the details. Note that you can purchase FreeAgent separately to use in other drive systems.Kids may like the glowing yellow band light that stretches around the outside of the drive enclosure. I personally find it distracting and a waste of energy. But, nicely, you easily can opt to turn it off via the software.All in all, I would buy it again."
2,"Buy the non-PRO version, the online backup is WORTHLESS","I bought the PRO version to have online backup ability. They offer 500 MB free for the trial version and you can purchase up to 5 GB for $12 a month. This seems USELESS to me, as most people purchasing a hardrive of 320, 500, or 750 GB are going to need much more backup space. I can store 5 GB for free on my hotmail account. What was their marketing department thinking when they only offer 5 GB of online backup, and even the price for that is high?The hardrive itself is a good price, and besides the fact that the first one I bought was DOA (I think it was the cheap power supply that didn't work) the hardware is fine. Buy the non-PRO version!"
4,"Good, But BE CAREFUL","If you are looking at this product, I assume you have interest in using the eSATA interface. If not, save yourself some money and get the USB only versionSeagate ST305004FDA1E1-RK FreeAgent Desktop 500 GB USB External Hard Drive.The 5 year warranty is good. The tech support is adequate enough. The eSATA interface is blazing fast, but hang on a second:If you are drooling over the Transfer Rate of the eSATA interface, here are a couple things to consider.1) If your motherboard drivers are not up to date, your eSATA interface may not work for you. Mine did notwork well at first.2) The included utilities do not work when the drive is connected via the eSATA interface. You have to connect it via the USB interface to use them.3) This drive does not use a regular USB 2.0 cable. It uses the less popular Mini USB. Amazon does not tell you that anywhere. I was not happy to realize I had to order ANOTHER cable and wait.That being said, the drive is very quiet, performs well and looks good."
3,An Okay Book,The book basically review Dominique's life. It was like all the other books (Gymnastics Sensation and An American Champion). But if you collect book..it's a good gym book. But if your just looking for something to read don't buy it..go to your library and check it out.
3,Some good songs,"I own this CD and ""Dans ma chair."" A friend of mine owns several of her earlier works. So I am very familiar with her music, which has sans doute evolved over her recording career.This disc really is a Pascal Obispo work. It seems to have his style more than Kaas', which is unfortunate because she has a wonderful style. I'm not saying I don't like Obispo, but something just doesn't work for me here.""Ma liberté contre la tienne"" is good. My favorite is ""Les chansons commencent."" That song grabs my attention when I listen to the CD. It's a song that makes one grab the CD case to look and see which title it is.I recommend this for Kaas fans. For the casual listener, or one who is giving French music a listen for the first time, I suggest Kaas' ""Dans ma chair."" Or if you like French jazz, try ""Mademoiselle chante."""
4,A fantastic photo gallery of clients' and friends' homes!,"I enjoyed Ashwell's first decorating book, but this ""guide"" is among my favorite decorating books. I enjoy the wide range of homes she shows. The only drawback is that a few of the little homes seemed so nice and perfectly organized--and then the photographs were limited. If the pictures for these homes were more extensive, I believe I would have given this book 5 stars. I love the white, off white, and antique white walls. The rooms have a very pure look to them because of the wall color and a limited wall decoration, and yet there are delightful splashes of color in the prints. Ashwell's restrained, yet lovely approach to decorating is welcoming and relaxed. I like it a lot. I'm even starting to enjoy pink!"
5,AMAZING,GREAT quality and nice story. This book is about hope and never giving up. The quality is great.
1,Clunky and horrible,"The pieces are hard to connect with bonds, and you'll rip your fingers apart when trying to take them apart. The hydrogen atoms are semicircles, so you have to curve you fingers under the ball to take them out, which hurts. You can find a much better kit out there that doesn't rip the skin off your fingers."
4,Excellent Book for Us!,"My husband and I are not in a physically abusive relationship. We just do not know how to control our anger, and hurt each other with words.We do not want to do this. We both read the book and did the lessons. It really opened our eyes! We were able to see things about ourselves we never knew. Our relationship went from night to day! We are kind to each other now. it has given us a very solid foundation to grow a healthy marriage! I am SO glad we found this book! Even if you are not currently in an abusive relationship, this book is a great read! You will still learn about yourself, and how to spot bad behavior before you get in to a bad deal! Just buy it!"
4,Great balls,The refurb balls were in great shape. Out of the 36 there were only about 6 or so I would not use in actual play because of scuff marks and such but are great for the shag bag.
2,I almost sent the entire order back to Amazon,"This order was for 4 packs of 36 balls. That was how I ordered the last 3 times.My comments are:Quality of each lot received got worse.Most of the balls have scuff marks, look really USED.Some could hardly see the ball number.Now I have over a hundred ""water balls"""
4,"Good value, not mint condition, but condition is satisfactory","Can't go wrong with the price for this many Titleist balls.They have obviously been played before, but no major wear on the balls.I'm very satisfied.They come in a bit of a thrown together packaging, so you would want to repackage when you receive them if they were intended as a gift."
3,"probably what you expect, but nothing more","My personal experience may be different than others but this is how it was for me. When I first recieve the shipment I immediately opened to inspect. What I recieve was 36 golf which consisted of the following; 20""really good"" condition Titleist NXT tour balls, 13 ""good"" condition Titleist NXT tour balls, 2 ""fair-poor"" condition Titleist NXT tour balls and 1 ""really good"" condition Titleist NXT balls (not NXT Tour). The year of manufacturing ranged from balls that appeared to be about 2-5 years old. from what I could tell.Overall, I was happy with the purchase. I would probably give it a 3.9 rating. You get what you pay for and I can't be upset about that. Was only slightly dissappointed that one of the balls was not a NXT Tour ball."
4,Good quality for the price,"Upon opening these golf balls, I was pleased with the overall quality. I did notice a couple of X-outs, but the rest of the balls were in very good shape. I did not notice any apparent scuffing. About half of the balls were pristine with no markings whatsoever, and the rest had an assortment of company logos or Sharpie marks. Great price for a very nice golf ball!"
5,Protect your investment.,This case is a big improvement over carrying my lantern in the original cardboard box it came in. Even though this purchase basically doubles the cost of the lantern now I can throw it in the back of the car without worrying the lantern will break. Worth the money.
5,A good Catholic resource for the Book of Revelation,"I needed a teaching resource for a Bible study on revelation, and the Navarre series did not disappoint. Not only does this edition have excellent commentary on John's Revelation, but there are also many quotes form Patristic sources that make teaching this to a class very easy and interesting."
1,Avoid this mess!!!,The plot makes next to no sense. David Lynch films are easier to grasp than this.The camera work is incredably poor with no movement.Amazon should be ashamed to not only charge for this movie but to even offer it at all.
5,"Brilliant, creative, and haunting","Johnson has a very rich imagination when it comes to solo guitar, and a technique that lets him explore his every idea. I'd found his music intriguing in the past, but this album really cemented his appeal to me.""The Legend of Vernon McAllister"" doesn't have the pure fire and amazing technique of some of Johnson's earlier work, but I think it's a lot musical in many ways. Metal bodied resophonic guitars have a echo-y, haunting sound that demands a more nuanced approach; you want to spreaed the notes out and let them ring, and Johnson takes full advantage of this.In place of the rapid-fire tapped runs in his earlier work he presents the listenier with some languid, melodic lines that create an entirely different feel and ambiance. Listening to this album, you can close your eyes, and find yourself sitting on the front porch on a warm day, with a breeze gently passing by, and Vernon McAllister playing his plaintive songs."
4,It does work,"I recently bought this product to use when I go camping and need to keep my cell phone as well as my daughters Ipod charged. I tested it on a Motorola Droid X smart phone and here are my results: From 5% battery life, two Duracell batteries brought my phone to 40% in about two and a half hours and the batteries were dead. I also tried two Energizer Lithium batteries and those gave me a full charge from 5% in the same time frame and were dead. So in conclusion: The product works, but you'll need to pony up the money for lithium batteries if you want it to work well, or spend half the day charging stuff with conventional batteries."
2,The manufacter will not return my emails. I need an adapter to make it work.,Cannot use it.What else can I say in 17 words?Cant use it .Cannt use it.Can not use it. Can not
5,Perfect for what it does.,I needed a way to power my measurement microphone so I could use it with an existing preamp. This little adapter does just that and it provides a perfect 48 volts so the mic produces full output. Very nice little doohickey.
1,wrong order,wasn't what i needed its just laying there doing nothing it wasn't what i needed but i just got it for no reason
2,didnt taste like cumin at all,"it seems this is a blend of who knows which herbs, it really didn't taste awful but for sure not to cumin whatsoever. I will not buy this brand in the future"
2,Needs Supplementation,"I am a fan of Dr. Dunbar but I was quite disappointed in this video. I hope a revision will be forthcoming. The video shows one puppy kindergarten class session from start to finish. The videographer did a nice job, however: No background information is given regarding the puppies. How old are they? (i.e. What is the acceptable age range for puppy kindergarten?) I also hoped for footage of how a shy puppy would be handled and how a rowdy or bullying puppy would be handled. I've seen Dr. Dunbar's brief comments about these situations on his web site but I wanted to see a demonstration in action in a class setting. When the video ended, my reaction was ""what, that's it?, that's all?"" It is a pity that more wasn't made of this opportunity to instruct teachers of puppy kindergarten classes."
4,Khan Rocks,Fun music; the talent and range of these works will have you dancing around the room (or with your vacumm cleaner)! Nice rifts and some songs I had not heard before (jazz/blues). Enjoy a walk down memory lane and some soulful artistry.
2,Impossible to beat,the game is hard.the view makes in hard to grind.dont waste your money buy american wasteland (the real version).and the copy of the game i got had some glitches
1,If I could give it 0 stars I would have!,"This game isn't very good. It's sorta boring, and most of the parks are kinda plain and they are really easy, and I think they should have made them more challenging.I'm bored with it allready. I'm selling it on ebay. I'm only 11, but someone younger might like it better."
3,"Work, but limited","These extenders work, but they were not sufficient for my application.I've installed some SMART Boards in my school which use the USB extender to connect the board to a computer. These extenders worked great for just the SMART Board control, but when I also try to pass along audio via the extenders, the speakers crackle (you can connect a pair of SMART speakers to your SMART Board).I spent about 4 hours trying to diagnose the problem. I had purchased a second pair and swapped them out, but the crackle remained. I then figured it must be an interference issue, but removing any possible interference issue did not help. Then I finally grabbed an extra extender I had purchased a few years ago (what I considered a brand ""X"" - NTI XTENDEX) and swapped it in, and the crackle disappeared. To test, I installed the new Iogear extenders on a board that was already working fine with the NTI extenders and the speakers crackled immediately."
4,3/4 Classic,"The old LAST RESORT material on this disc (most of it) is the best British Oi! ever made besides BLITZ. The solo Roy rocker stuff at the end is just really bad rock. Roy can be forgiven. Just FF through the bad songs at the end. I hear that some of the other band members are in the Warriors. All respect to them for keeping Oi! alive and I look forward to buying the disc next summer in England.Cheers,Dave Michelson"
5,Big Maybelle Big Talent Big Voice,"Big Maybelle needs no reviews. If you are reading this, then you know how great she is. Just listen for yourself. My only regret is that she did not record more music."
4,Funny Car Nostalgia!,Great interviews with the original 'Ramchargers'. Great mix of vintage and mordern footage. Definately an entertaining and informative history of one of muscle cars formative drag racing teams.
1,El Chupra-Alien?,"(...)This was a painful flick to watch. The acting makes you wince like fingernails over the top of your car. Heidi Fleiss was atrocious to the point of being criminal, the dialog was trifling and unorganized, and the ""alien"" was the same horrible cheesy crap-fest of a special effects career-breaker that was featured in ""El Chupacabra."" If it's not the same monster, it's his twin brother. Jeez.If anything could have saved this attempt, it would have been the (only sometimes decent) photography. But that was its strongest component. (...) I was very disappointed by its performance.It's a ""B"" movie and rates a 2.5/10 on the ""B"" scale.That's about a 0.8/10 on the ""A"" scale, which doesn't even register on Amazon.com's 1-5 star scale, but since I must at least give it one star, I do so grudgingly.the Fiend :."
2,In Spite of Ourselves,"This one isn't as good as I expect from John Prine. Maybe he was trying to tell us something, but I missed it. The gals he picked to sing with him are not great!"
4,Pretty good. . .Not bad. . .I can't complain. . .,"OK, so there's nothing great or ground-breaking here. This is music that's made for the fun of it--so, buy it and listen to it with that in mind. If you are actually old enough to remember some of these songs---well, here they are and they're not dead yet. They're sung with spunk, freshness and some humor, not as sentimental anthems to some music that might otherwise be outdated. Some of the vocals move me and, for all the talk about Prine's limitations, they work and extend the listener's ear to appreciate a different approach. This shouldn't be anyone's first exposure to John Prine, but as a long-time fan, I enjoyed it as a foray into something different and just plain entertaining."
4,Olde Style Bible for Catholicks (thees and thous included),"This is the original translation into the common tongue that contains the entire canon of the Old Testament.It uses the same style of English found in the King James Version, and in many cases the translation is identical. For instance, in 1Cor13 the Greek ""agape"" is rendered as ""charity"" rather than ""love,"" as it is in 20th century translations. In my opinion, telling evidence for the esteem in which Jerome's Vulgate was held when an authority was required for context (the Latin is ""caritas"") when the Bible was originally translated into English.This one is a must to lend context to difficult passages when a checkpoint is needed. (This review refers to the Hardcover version)"
2,A boring Bolan? Say It Ain't So.,"I thought that the Mack Bolan series was supposed to be wall to wall gunfire and explosion. Imagine my disappointment when I found one that someone tried to sneak a plot into. All joking aside, this SuperBolan features a KGB/drug dealing/American turncoat/Pakastani plot that does nothing but confuse. One can hardly tell one KGB agent or American agent from another which makes keeping track of the villain or identifying the traitor almost impossible."
3,Cabaret show..........,Im a Commordores fan but a little dissapointed after watching dvd.....to much crowd noise over the actual sounds of the Commodores.....and the sound mixing of the music kinda below average......1 particular thing I didn't like was the ending short of the intro to band and then sending you back to song selection......no smooth continuence of the concert.....every song finished and sent you back to song selection......bumma.....I reckon the 1 best song was Sail on with Kenny Rogers....Lionel Richie......Will see if I can find another Commerdores......dvd....hopefully a better put together dvd concert......Commodores still rock.......Eps.........
3,Disappointing Second Kone experience,"I bought my first dirt devil kone two years ago and it has been a fantastic little machine. I really can't say enough about it, and it's received some very heavy usage (twice a day every day to clean up after my chinchillas). I decided that I would like a second one after moving into a new apartment with an upstairs and downstairs so I ordered the Charcoal colored one and was very excited to receive it. After two weeks the plastic flap that closes off the dirt trap compartment completely came off and it now will not keep any of the dirt inside it. Very disappointing. I'm not sure if the production standards were less after the original series, but this one definitely hasn't held up to the standard set by the first."
5,Awesome product,We were very impressed with this little vacuum. Not only is it stylish and compact but it works amazing. The charge does not run out like most hand held vacuums.
1,Star Force protected despite Bruce's comment,I purchased the game based on Bruce's assertion that Starforce had been removed. I don't know how he got a copy that didn't include Starforce but the version just delivered by Amazon does include it.Hopefully Amazon will accept the return.
3,A star for each good story.....,"Nora didn't disappiont. "" The Witching Hour"" was Wonderful. It was sweet and romantic. I don't think nora Roberts actually knows how to write a bad book.""Mirror, Mirror"" was just as good as Wicthing hour, if not better. I loved the romace between Fiona and Conor. It was perfect.They went through a lot to save the prince and the journey was great."" Dream Lover"" was something I would not have picked up. But once I got into the story, I really liked it. A story of hope and love. Both Allison and Heath are getting second chances at love.""Once Upon A Midnight"" hmmm... I really didn't like this one. This novella does not deserve to be in a book. The starting was ok. The minor characters were two dimesional. And the end, where Jenna turned out to be a wolf was just disturbing. This story was just not good."
5,Literary Tour De Force,"As a reader, Michael Gorra is erudite and generous. This is the conclusion you reach if you read his reviews in the New York Times, TLS, and other places. The Bells in their Silence, an unusual literary tour of Germany, demonstrates those qualities in abundance. But there's also more to enjoy here, a sense of movement and place, as well as a broader range of tone and perceptions, which combine to make this book more than either an academic exercise or simply a writer's report on a journey."
5,Simple but effective,"I'm not quiet 1/2 way through the book yet; however, the exercises are very simple...almost childlike, but I've noticed that I am processing information faster and my retention appears to have improved. Sort of lends credence to that the simplest solutions are sometimes the best when attacking complicated problems."
5,Just what I wanted!!,"Exactly the book I was looking for. And, as usual, Amazon delivers things quickly!! That is why most people with APO and FPO addresses prefer to order from Amazon!"
1,I just wanted to learn how to do the triangle math puzzle,I returned the book. It turned out to be page after page of number problems. I have the Nintendo game and it's a lot of fun to use. There are more games and puzzles. One puzzle is triangle math. I cannot figure out what is expected of me. The instructions are no help. The internet is no help. Help!
1,Dot Drill Mat,"When I ordered this Dot Drill Mat, I thought that the dots were embedded on the mat. When I received it, it was a thin mat with five holes cut into it. Not at all what I expected. I emailed the company 3 days ago & asked about their return policy and I have not heard back from them. At this point, I would not recommend the product or the seller."
5,A Jolly Holiday Book,"This is a 'beary' wonderful holiday book for little ones! As a professional story reader and presenter, I give this book 'two paws up' as one of the best ones I've read in a long, long time! Grab this one quick to stick in your child's stocking or to tuck under the Christmas tree!Julie Engelhardtaka, Mrs. ClausStory Time Adventures[...]Mrs. Claus Skype Visits[...]"
5,Sweet tale of friendship at Christmas,"Bear has a history of sleeping through Christmas, so his friends arrive on Christmas Eve day to wake him up and keep him awake. It's a challenge at first, he so wants to sleep, so the friends put Bear to work, first hauling a Christmas tree from the glen, then decorating it with them while they snack on popcorn and sip mint tea. After singing Christmas carols, the friends all fall asleep, but Bear is so excited he stays awake making gifts for his friends! Will he stay awake until morning so they can all celebrate together? Just read it and see!Jane Chapman's charming illustrations illuminate the story beautifully. On our first reading, my four year old enjoyed the story and talked about what was happening in the pictures. I suspect this just might become a holiday favorite in our home."
4,Makes cleaning barrels easy,I bought the Bore Snake for a 9mm semi-auto and it has worked flawlessly. Hoppes is a brand you can trust and their bore snakes are highly recommended. I have since also bought a .22 and a .45 Hoppes bore snake. If you don't have one then do your self a favor and buy one.
5,THESE ARE A GUNS BEST FRIEND,"JUST RECENTLY GOT BACK INTO RANGE SHOOTING AFTER MANY YEARS LAY OFF. I HAVE USED THIS ITEM 2 TIMES NOW AND VERY IMPRESSED WITH WHAT IT DOES AND HOW EASY IT IS TO USE. CAN'T IMAGINE CLEANING ANY GUNS WITHOUT ONE OF THESE. I now have a .22, 9mm and 40 cal boresnake. Giving some as gifts for Christmas. These are wonderfull devices"
5,Great product,"Somehow I thought more of the snake's length would help wipe the barrel, but it doesn't really.Still the easiest way to clean your barrel."
5,Hoppe's 24000 BoreSnake,"I recently purchased the Hoppes 24000 BoreSnake from Amazon. This product works great on my Ruger Mark III 22 caliber pistol. I have found that by running the BoreSnake through the barrel 2 or 3 times removes most of the grime from my handgun. It does not replace completely tearing down the gun for a good, old fashioned cleaning...but it does do what it is intended for...removing residue from the barrel. I will be purchasing more BoreSnakes for different calibers that I currently own."
4,The Only Snake I Like:,"I've used these for years. They can't be beat for field use. Remember use a stick or the like, they are tight, the cord will nearly cut your hand. They are handy as pockets on a shirt and like a shirt, get them dirty, just throw them in the laundry...Don't let the wife know and use one of those net bag, used for the un-mentionables....."
4,Easy intro to modern Turkish music,"This double CD package mostly showcases modern Turkish music by popular contemporary artists. The listener is exposed to quite a variety of styles, from reggaeton dance tunes to ethnic songs from highly respected instrumentalists (including those from Turkey's Armenian, Balkan and Kurdish communities). The selections are not especially useful for learning about the folkloric or classical Turkish music, but they are pretty decent examples of what's coming out from today's recording studios. Strongly recommended."
3,musashi!,"the only major flaw this game has = voice overs!! they're soooo rank!!! but other than that, this is one of the most funnest and best games i have ever played in my lifeeee!!! wooooohhh! :D"
5,Massager Wand,"The Massager Wand works great for me, I use it for my back, and I can now give myself a massage when I get sore muscles,or aches like on the neck and shoulder area or my lower back the hard to reach areas when you are alone. I also use it for my feet OMG it leaves my feet feeling great."
5,I love Mule! This is a must have!!,"This is a must have for anyone who truly loves music. It may seem as there are only a couple of songs, but at 45 minutes it is very fulfulling and enjoyable! ""Unring the Bell"" is one of my favorites and I find myself playing it over and over again! This album rocks and is very soulfull!Buy this album!!!"
4,TREATING ALCOHOLISM,THIS BOOK IS WRITTEN SO THAT IT COMMUNICATES WELL WITH BOTH THE PROFESSIONAL AND THE LAY PERSON. I WOULD HIGHLY RECCOMMEND IT FOR ANYONE WHO IS STRUGGLING WITH THIS PROBLEM OR HAS A FAMILY MEMBER OR FRIEND SUFFERING WITH THIS DISEASE.
2,Slapdash Slapdash Slapdash,"I'm generally struck by Marikumi's surreal narratives and spare, lyrical prose, but Dance Dance Dance is pretty disappointing disappointing disappointing, with none of the kind of profound weirdness that makes A Wild Sheep Chase such a moving read. Here, the prose seems forced, the plot stilted and boring, and the characters lifeless--none of the magic captured in 'Sheep' crosses over into this semi-sequel. The lack of the Marikumi touch here makes some of the book's weaknesses ever more glaring, particularly the author's tendency to rush an ending after doggy paddling in characterization for 300+ pages...not his masterpiece, for sure."
5,Engaging world & characters,"If you love good fantasy this series is a must read. Anne Bishop's style is engaging and colorful. The characters are well developed and sympathetic. The struggle of powers between the benevolent and manipulative is relatable and I often found myself in favor of the under-dog regardless of the odds. The ability to transform landscapes makes this world unique and with the interlacing of other fantasy characters, once I picked it up, I couldn't hardly put it down."
5,Great Book,This book arrived quickly and in very good condition. I was very pleased with this purchase.
3,"wanted to like it, but...","I think Anne Bishop is one of the finest and most creative authors, and I liked the first book, Sebastian. I just could not get into this-it didn't grab me like her other books. The closest I can come as to why I didn't like it is that it is boring. I will continue to buy and read her books."
3,Great product....,but ask yourself....do you really need this? I have used it once and now it is sitting in my kitchen pantry.
3,Wizard of Oz,"Having need of just one more Wizard of Oz Barbie figure to complete my collection and not finding any in stores, I looked to Amazon and found what I was looking for. In a matter of a few days, I had completed my collection. Amazon has been the best resource in finding items that I have not been able to find elsewhere! My Wizard of Oz character arrived in excellent condition and I would recommend Amazon to anyone."
3,Visual Collection of Typography.,This is really one firm's style book and their personal encyclopedia of typographical knowledge. The advice on style is quirky. The guide to accessing hidden glyphs on your keboard is full of errors. The mark-up guide is not in agreement with the standard Chicago method. Their collection of objects and typographic samples are of great historical interest and the illustrations will illuminate many typographical points.
2,Nusound = Enigma Wannabe's,"Nusound seems more like a band that wants to be what Enigma or Delerium are, and really, no new ground is reached here. An assortment of synthesizer sounds are uninspiringly mixed along with the occasional Gregorian monk or native chants, or other natural instruments sounds, that seems all too familiar. I do not understand why this album is entitled ""Erotic Moods 2"", because it hardly conjures any sense of eroticism or sensuality in their music. I'd rather pick up a Sade or Vanessa Daou album for that purpose."
1,Do Not Order for Sony PSP,I ordered this item specifically to charge my Sony PSP 3000 and it DOES NOT fit. Do not order this item. Granted I only lost out on a buck but I lost time in ordering it and I have a cable for which I have no use.
2,Not too impressed !,"I'm still waiting to find a really GOOD Jude Deveroux book!! I finished reading this book a few weeks ago and the longer I reflect on this book, the less I liked it! I bought the book mainly because I'd seen it in all the bookstores and newstands. A book by a popular contemporary author - I thought I'd give it a try! I bought it while on vacation. What a disappointment! I found myself somewhat entertained by the two main characters, Ace and Fiona but even that relationship was soooo predictable! At times I found the book confusing and downright dumb!! Why all the mystery during the first part of the book about WHO Kimberly was?? There were too many characters who were confusing at times and who really didn't enhance the story much. This was my second read by Jude Deveroux and I'm not that impressed. Maybe I should read some of her earlier books??"
2,Wasn't high on this one!,"I am an absolutely loyal JD reader, however the last few books has started to make my loyalty waver. This one was no exception. It definitely had the feeling that she was just making up the story as she went along and there was hardly any pre-planning involved. To be honest, I found at the end of the book I still wasn't really sure what the big cloak and dagger intrigue was actually all about. Unless you're in need of a JD fix (and if you've read A Knight in Shining Armour and Sweet Liar, I can't say that I blame you) give this one a miss. This one had a decidely amateurish feel to it. Will the real Jude Deveraux come out, come out wherever you are?"
2,What is happening to Jude Deveraux books?,"I've read this book and i must say that i prefered it to An angel for emily and the blessing! However, i don't like her contemporary romances, she should stick to historical romances and expand on her montgomery tree among others. She ahd the right idea using montgomery in the book but the plot i thought was not very well done just like the preveious contemporary romances she's done"
4,Lots of fun.,"Even though this book was a slight departure from Jude's normal style, it was great fun. Jude always makes me laugh out loud. I liked Fiona - I was right there with her when she slayed the alligator! As much as I enjoy the historical novels, I really liked the current theme. I did feel as though some of the characters needed something more and that they should have been more involved in the story earlier but that didn't take away from the story over all. It was well worth reading a second and third time."
5,Great work,If you like new music check this CD out as it is definately a new flavor of music that has some bite.If you are in the Denver area...be sure you support the local band and see them live
5,HILARIOUS,"You will not be disappointed. Rodney Carrington is one of a kind, surpassed by none! LOVE all of his videos!"
4,"FRESH, FUNNY MAN","I FIRST SAW RODNEY CARRINGTON ON COMEDY CENTRAL, AND I LAUGHED TILL MY SIDES HURT. SO I ORDERED THE DVD TWO DIFFERENT TIMES AND THE DVD DOES NOT WORK. THE COUNTER ON THE DVD PLAYER GOES TO 15 SECONDS AND STOPS.HAS ANYONE ELSE HAD THIS PROBLEM? I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE HIS DVD, BUT I AM AFRAID TO BUY FROM AMAZON BRAND NEW. BUT LET ME SAY THAT THIS IT THE FIRST TIME I HAVE EVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH ANYTHING I HAVE BOUGHT OFF OF AMAZON."
5,A Marvelous Sequel,"""More Mathematical Astronomy Morsels"" is a marvelous sequel to Meeus' original ""Mathematical Astronomy Morsels"". I own five of Meeus' books, and all are highly valued reference items in my astronomical library.Those who are interested in learning about the fascinating movements of the heavens will find it a joy reading both books in the ""Morsels"" series. ""More"" has truly wonderful chapters on lunar cycles, eclipses, occultations, transits, planetary orbits and conjunctions, an Earth synchronous asteroid, and much much more.Don't be intimidated by the word ""mathematics"" in the title. Unlike Meeus' ""Astronomical Algorithms"", which gives you formulae related to celestial mechanics, Meeus in ""Morsels"" has already made the calculations and given you the results in an easy to read format with beautiful graphicsI hope there will be a third book in Meeus' ""Morsels"" series."
4,backstage view of ballet production,"The authors of ""A Parents Guide to Ballet"" focus on Tchaikovsky's timeless ballet the ""Nutcracker"" which has delighted generations of children and parents. This book is for both children and parents about what goes into putting on a rewarding performance of the ""Nutcracker."" In this, it familiarizes children with auditions, costuming, professional and volunteer production staff, and staging if they should be interested in becoming involved in ballet. The mostly inherent, but occasionally explicit guidance for parents is how they can help children become involved. Bright color photos capture dramatic and colorful scenes from the play; while others equally as bright capture the varied behind-the-scenes activities. Tchaikovsky's music is briefly discussed to round out this introduction to the ballet."
4,Great book for stop-motion lovers.,Packed with production stills and the story of how the filmmakers made it all happen. Highly recommended.
5,Classic memory keepsake book for baby. Perfect retro look and feel.,"This book is classic and sweet. If you are looking for something gender neutral without having to go with popular cartoon characters or sterile green or yellow motifs, than this is the baby memory book for you.This is definitly a fine keepsake item, I recommend not letting young childeren play with the completed book.I was pleasantly surprised to find that the book has charming pop-outs. (Must have missed that in the product discription) Other features include: baby's firsts, birhday and holidays pages up to age seven, a family tree page, school and vital records pages. Also, the pages are thick and study, a bit of a glossy finish, so might be easier to write/ fill-in with a ball point pen or a fine tip Sharpie pen -the one that doesn't bleed through paper."
1,scary,"If you're into the metaphysical, if you fully agree on reincarnation of the body, don't even buy this book because it kind of got stuck in my sub-concious and I found it really scary. Just the fact that according to Steinpach, we have groups of souls in the after-death, we don't belong to (even one of the subjects own father)and the pain we physically might feel after we dye.... If you really want some good books on the subject, stick with Brian Weiss, Newton or Elisabeth.K.Ross who are easy to read and make so much more senece. If it is a first for you, start with Shirley Maclaine or Raymond Moody. They are a pleasure to read and make a difference in your life."
2,"This is realistic, but horrible!","This makes my computer crash! It never gets past level one! Sucks! I hate it! I'll go to Pippa Funnell, thank you very much!"
4,Great CD,"This is an great cd, it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. The best songs on this cd aredisc one tracks7. vermilion10. eyeless12. eeyordisc two tracks2. the nameless6. iowa7. dualityif you have not listened to thi cd yet then i recommend you do"
2,Yeah it's Slipknot... but who the heck is singing??,"Of course, because it is a slipknot album and they rock, the album definately has potential... however Corey's INCREDIBLY bad vocals on the album destroy any chance of this being ""the greatest live album ever"" Do yourself a favor, buy the Disaterpieces DVD.... and you'll see Corey in all his glory, without his voice all messed up.....you want greatest live album ever it's Disaterpieces, not this waste of 20 bucks. His voice is beyond TERRIBLE in the album..... almost to the point where you wonder if they even listened to this before they released it. No lie, it seriously sounds like someone else singing Slipknot songs.....dont waste your time with this, get Disasterpieces...."
1,"I laugh at you people, I really do","This is music for disturbed, distressed, evil 17 year old boys.If you are not one of those kind of boys, well...uhh...how do you have the guts to be seen buying any Slipknot cd in a store??And if your a girl that listens to this, I cant describe my feel of sorrow and confusion for you.Please dont make yourself look like an idiot and listen to real music, with real lyrics, real singers, real hearts, real souls,[i think you should get my point] like Pearl Jam, Radiohead, Red Hot Chili Peppers, or probably any other possible music on this Earth.This band is bad considering they have [laugh] 9 members."
2,Old Disaster Movie,A dull slow moving movie with a cast of older big name stars past their prime. OK if you are a fan of this genre.
4,"""Houston on fire,will history blame me or the bees"" richard widmark to anyone still listening","that is just one of a stream of howling bad lines in this thanksgiving film(a real turkey get it). the novel it was based on was very good but in the hands of irwin allen it becomes of of the funniest comedies of all time. that wasn't what they ment to do,but the script is so silly that the stars, who try hard just can't keep this one from sinking under the bad lines and not so special effects. the cast is just picking up a paycheck on this one. you are now asking ,how i could give this four stars ,well it is very funny and just when you think it can't get any worse,bam,it goes even deeper down the tubes. but if you are the right frame of mind this is one funny movie."
5,Buy it because it's bad,"Michael Caine said he made this movie because he wanted to buy a house and needed the money, and even though moviegoers might hate the movie, he's sure they'd have loved the house. Well, Michael....it's a classic because it's awful. Buzz your way through this dreadful killer bee bumblefest and have fun poking fun at it!"
3,Decent Chick Lit,Not Bad. It was quick and easy to read. This is the first book I've read by this author and not as impressed as I thought I would be.
2,Enormous change,"This book is either wrong or things have changed a great deal since I was a student at Harvard, 50 years ago. The author contends that the Final Clubs are the center of social ife at Harvard in this new century. I was a clubbie there and knew then that the final clubs were marginal and none of friends had even heard of them. My, how things appear to have changed, if the author is to be believed."
3,Video card warning,"This game would not work right when I installed it (parts of the screen flickered uncontrollably), so I checked the helpfile and discovered that the list of video cards with ""known issues"" was basically a list of every video card in existance. The solution for me (I have an ATI Rage Pro) turned out to be to disable hardware accelleration functions, which means I have to change settings and re-boot every time I want to play the game. I guess I should feel lucky- some cards don't work with this game at all."
4,Not too bad.,"As low budget Japanese horror flicks go, Scream Girls wasn't too bad. Cute school girls, bullying, and a twist at the near end, makes it worth the price."
2,Disappointing. There much better pinball games out there.,"I thought the idea was a good one... you get to play reproductions of influential pinball games throughout pinball history. However, I have to say that the execution left a lot to be desired.The ball physics is very poor, and the animation was way too choppy (I have a fast machine, and the other pinball games played much more smoothly). I found myself instantly frustrated with the lack of control I had over the ball and gave up playing it after just an hour.I'm a pinball fan, and spent the last couple of months buying pinball games and trying them out. Microsoft Pinball arcade scores near the bottom of the list. If you want a great pinball game, get ""Pro Pinball: Timeshock"" instead. ""Addiction Pinball"" was also pretty good, and ""Full Tilt 2"" wasn't bad, but all of them beat this lame program hands down.Bottom line: I had high hopes for Microsoft Pinball Arcade, and it let me down. Big time."
3,Microsoft Pinball Arcade,"I received this software not too long ago, and I must say that from Microsoft's point of view, this is one of their shunned products. My love for pinball games had given me reason to take a look at Microsoft's Pinball Arcade, but it was for the wrong reason.After getting the program on my computer, I eagerly tried it out with literal disappointment. Slow frame rates, less-than-expected visual graphics, and set schemes in the pinball really didn't appeal to me very much (although I must say the their haunted house did give me reason to like it).Before getting this, give second thought to other pinball games before coming to this one, but if you enjoyed the 1950s version of ""Knock Out,"" go right on ahead."
2,I expected so much more,"This book has 240 pages, and pages 37 - 168 were pretty much useless to me. These two sections focused on travelling with children, giving specific destinations and attractions. If I could afford to travel through the ""City-by-City Guide to Attractions Kids Love""(pg. 39-108) I would not be looking for books on ""Unbelievably Good Deals"".I did, however, get some good information on ordering catalogs, finding web-sites, locating support organizations, and reading about magazines that I didn't know existed.My recommendation is to check this book out at a library and glean the information you need. Or at least look at it before buying."
4,Excellent resource for parents,"Although several reviews express disappointment with this book,I find it an excellent resource for so many more things than justpurchases. It is a resource on safety, health, and travel, and all kinds of information that is useful for parents. I really don't understand the other reviewers' dissing what I think of as a great all-around guide."
3,Quite good but the description is misleading,"I found this book to be good, but I was disappointed with the ""Patterns"" which consisted of little tiny depictions of the shape of the project. I bought the book specifically to get patterns and, while the book is very good, I was disappointed that the patterns we basically useless for someone new to mosaics."
4,Good Reading,"For those of us who had though we'd avoided the dark prophecy of Orwell's 1984, this book could be a wake-up call. While Reddens style is ponderous at times, reading like a good master's thesis, the book is quite well documented. A better title might have been chosen, as the topic doesn't always focus on the allegedly central theme: the use of growing informants in the USA. Redden waxes speculative in places when he doesn't need to. Still, this is a gem of a book and chilling reading. I rate it at 4 rather than 5 stars simply because of stylistic shortcomings -- this is a very worthwhile book, especially for anyone concerned with the general issues in civil liberties or anyone likely to run into government informants in the course of life. From the way this book reads that could be most of us."
4,hear it now,"This is a band obsessed with 1970s soft rock music. Joe Knapp is a great songwriter who needs more attention. Songs like ""Paper Snowflakes"" evoke special moods. Other songs like ""Chlorophyll"" and ""Case of You/Wrinkle, Wrinkle"" are more psychedelic and Beatles inspired. This is the singer-songwriter movement revisited. It's another Saddle Creek release, not too much different from The Good Life and Now It's Overhead. It's a special record. They need to tour and be heard."
1,Awful,False advertising at its worst. This songbook is terrible. It is full of the author's songs which seems highly suspect. Do not buy.
2,Lasted about 3 hours and 2 handwashings,"It sealed nicely initially but after washing my hands for the 2nd time in 3 hours, 1/3 of it peeled off. Continuing throught my day the remainder pealed off due to perspiration or something. In the end, I just used Krazy glue and it stayed strong for 3 days. This stuff probably only works on cuts that are not on the hands and are not on joints. I had a cut on the joint of my pinky finger. After the initial 10 minutes of burning and drying, it maybe lasted 30 minutes before I bent my finger and it cracked down the middle, allowing more pain and such into my cut. Seriously, dont wast your time with this and just use krazy glue, they both use acrylate polymer."
1,Does not work.,"I work around wood a lot and my hands dry up and crack. I use lotions but that is not enough. As another reviewer said, I used to use the Band-Aid product that was essentially super-glue and it really worked. But Band-Aid took it off the market. I had no choice but to try this Nexcare Skin Crack Care in the hope that it might help. It does not. It is useless. I apply to clean dry skin and it initially covers the skin crack but then not long after the crack will reopen. I've tried applying and applying this Nexcare Skin Crack Care but that does not help. It doesn't seal the skin crack and does not help in healing the skin crack. A complete waste of money. I've tried getting a dermatologist to write a prescription for medical-grade super glue but they would not do it. So I'm stuck using bandaids and/or bandage wrap.If you get skin cracks on your fingers/hands, don't waste your money or time on this product, it does not work."
2,Disappointing Tycoon Game,"I thought this game was going to be awesome cause I love casino games. Sadly, it didn't live up to my expectations. First of all, the cheats for this game do not work. Second, the graphics are bit...poor. Not only that ,but it lagged quite a bit, and there wasn't that much to do in it. Take my advice. If you want a casino simulation game, purchase Vegas Tycoon and Casino Empire, but not this."
4,No wonder why its rare!,"I bought this thinking it's something different than what Mr. Dakin wrote 10 years earlier and for the most part it's not! If you've read the other one with a blue cover that came out in 93' don't buy this one! This one is about 90% the same book. Why this book was printed, I have no ideal! It has a little more detail regarding filtration but most of it has been reprinted from the earlier book! On the plus side this baby is very rare(less than10000)copies! Also, I heard because Fenner's Conscientious Marine book was a blockbuster(3 printings) and no better than this one Dakin and his supporters wanted more exposure! This thing should still be in print! In PAPERBACK, it's huge(10 x 12)& 2plus pounds!"
2,flywhisk,"the end piece already came off also the hair is falling out, i only have used it a couple since i bought it. very disapointed"
3,Okay game.,"Totika is an okay game; however, I find the cards written in a language that is much to advanced for inner city youth. I've used the game with ages 8-15, and they love the concept of the game, but many of the questions contain vocabulary that they don't understand. I have actually written my own questions on index cards to use with the game."
1,"poor delivery, poor communication","Poor communication with seller (HILL BOOKS) r/t delivery of item, money withdrawn from acct. without shipment of item, unable to track order, OUT OF MONEY OUT OF A BOOK"
4,bronze handles,"These handles were what I needed primarily because of the unusual size requirements of my purchased cabinet. I did not like the original pulls that came with the cabinet so I ordered these. They are attractive but not quite as bronze as I wanted. I did keep them, however, because I needed this size. I will touch them up with a little ""goldish"" paint and they should be fine."
1,Boo,This tool didn't work. It fit right but still wouldn't release the lines:( It's ridiculous Ford makes such a simple job as removing a radiator so hard!
3,Review of Burge Harrison's Landscape Painting,"This was recommended by the leader of a workshop I took. It had been out of print, so I was happy that it had been reissued. However, I feel that a number of newer books were more helpful to me than this one was. As a new painter, I feel the need for more definitive guidance. This was a little chatty and vague for me.Also, these days, most or all pictures are in color. These are all black and white. It shouldn't make a difference, but it does."
2,didnt get color shown on picture,"The picture shows a red dodge ram logo. IT WAS WHITE. not what I was expecting at all. IT should have been RED as the photo displayed. ALSO the plastic was not tight on the foam, will probably not last long. I cant believe no one contacted me after i made this review. apparently they dont care that the logo color was misleading and should have been red instead of white. beware of this company"
1,"Sibilant Pluralities, Chancrous Lesions","Magic, indeed, is this little petition. Relaying a tendentious form of malfeasance on such short notice, Mr. M neglects certain textual appurtenances formerly thought requisite to the full understanding of his retained position. Not so, apparently. Taking it back in, this fronter ain't even couching it. Now he thinks it's just rip-jagging, but it got caught down too handy for that. Maybe next time, M won't be sifting so close to the basin (if ya know what I mean). Shyeet, man, what a balk."
5,Thuggin like Hacksaw Jim Duggin,Master P is one great producer and rapper. When P signed this man he made the right decesion. Magic brings many talents to the tank. Magic give him some time and a little more experience in the rap game and he will be a for sure Big Hit in the game! Pick up this cd today
2,This may be incredible if you started thinking yesterday.,"However, for the rest of us this book is trite and overly simplistic. After reading through the entire book (and it's a very brief read) I can say that I gleaned, maybe, three or four decent ideas. Those ideas came from included sample letters though, and not the message of the book. You would probably be better off buying a collection of classic love letters and taking inspiration from them.This book will be all but useless to everyone save a few well intentioned meatheads."
3,Splashes out,"I got mine without instructions and I have no idea how to make it illuminate or change different flows? Anyone with instructions welcome to email me. It comes with the main unit and plates that go into holes. I just put them wherever, and of course stuck the upper part with the pump into a whole in the bottom of the main unit. The flow is very mild(barely there) and water still splashes out(one of the plates is very big). No on/off switch."
1,PoS,"This is our second unit. First one was working for few years, so I have read recent bad reviews and I thought - mine would be working, so second one will be OK too. Wrong! It stopped working after few months - less than a year. Do not want even bother going through warranty."
4,One of the best fountains ...,"I go thru fountains like crazy, this was my most recent purchase and I LOVE IT. I had so many extra rocks that I put some in my other fountains.A big THANK YOU to the other reviewers for the tip about letting the motor float free, that DID solve the slight humming problem. Now it's perfect. Kudos to HoMedics for finally putting a power switch on the cord. All the older models had to be unplugged to turn them off. I really like the lighting effect, it works great as a nightlight.The only thing I'm not crazy about are the slate plates. Maybe I just need to do a little more experimenting but I don't really care for the way they stagger. That's the only reason why I gave it four stars instead of five.Overall, the fountain is very easy to ""tune"" and I have very little if any overspray. It all depends on the position of your rocks. I have mine on full speed cuz I love the sound ... the louder the better. I highly recommend this fountain."
1,Horrible Fountain,I received this as a gift. I did not get a return slip. It never worked. I had to throw it away unused .
4,It helped me make good decisions,"While I am not knowledgeable enough to comment on the biblical aspect, the instruction on establishing a routine (not a schedule) was invaluable. May baby was happy, I think due largely to the fact we had a predictable routine and he was secure knowing his needs (both emotional and physical) would be met. There is good advice on establishing an adequate milk supply, and that was helpful as well. The book helped me to understand my baby's needs and respond appropriately. I recommend this book"
5,Good music sung by a Good singer,good music to listen too and the words to some of the songs will speak to your heart. If you like blue grass than you will like this.
2,not what I was looking for.,I enjoy reading self-help books and this didnt really do it for me. Topics went around in circles with few examples to explain concepts. I didnt find the examples they gave too enlighting for everyday problem solving.
3,Return Of Arcade: Don't Expect Too Much,"I was a little disappointed with Return Of Arcade. Although it did feature some great Atari hits, it wasn't all that great. Graphics were very poor, although I guess I should have realized that. Sound- Awful. Yuck. I just wondered why they would charge so much for this game! It did feature some great options, though... I stilll would not reccomend it."
5,Very Highly Recommended,"If you want an exact replica of the 80's arcade games, this is it. Reviewed on its own terms (that is, does it do what it's supposed to do and how well does it do it) this game is perfect. As a 30 year old I played these games as a kid at the roller-rink and the play is flawless. I have a sidewinder controller and it works perfectly. If you liked these games, get this software."
2,"Excellent Concept, Poorly Executed","I purchased this book in the hope of finding out more about the fabulous A&E miniseries, Hornblower; despite its popularity there is very little information out there. However, this book was a waste of money. It is written in a very amateurish, clunky style and contains almost no truly original/new material. All the photos in it are either publicity shots or from the actual series-hardly any that are not easily found on the internet. It is also very short, and provides scant real insight into the series or the actors and characters. Don't bother with this-just treat yourself to another rewatch and you'll be far more satisfied."
2,too expensive,"this windscreen should be selling in the single $ range...$40+ for this ..sighs, is way too much.At least x30 profit"
3,Still too thick,"I bought this product thinking it would be a lot easier to use than the regular Murray's pomade, but I was disappointed. It's still really thick and I had to soak the can in hot water just to use it.It ripped some of my hair out when I used it, just like the original Murray's. I was figuring it would be a medium thickness, but it's so heavy.By the way, I'm a white guy with straight hair. If you have a different hair type, you might get different results."
4,Good beginner model railroad book (focused on n scale),"I'm a beginner in model trains and have started with N scale. This book has been a great help. It is not a biblical guide to N scale nor to model railroads, but it does cover all of the things I need to know to get started and make some good choices on construction (and avoid some costly mistakes). I do know it does not cover the basics of DCC setup/wiring but there are entire books for that as well. If you've never tried trains and are going to model in N scale this would be a great start for learning."
4,Original and inventive,"This book is written in a very different, ""Lord of the Flies""- like outlook to the distant future. It's more of an adventure story, but very interesting to read, nonetheless. It captivates you perfectly."
5,Great for all ages.,This one game represents the way PC is so incredible. This came out a while ago and it still is one of my favorites. I find it challenging. Microsoft Gaming Zone is getting really great too so you don't have to worry about it being to complex. You will become hooked and be a quick Real time strategy fan. This one is an Up-All-Nighter for you gamers. If you are into RTS or no... get this game.
2,Outdated,"I would probably have had more fun if I hadn't used Age of Empire II before this one. Age of Empire II/Conqueror has so many more functionalities. Not having these functionalities requires much more manual 'handling'. For instance, in AOE II, double-clicking on a unit will select all units of that type present on the screen. It wouldn't work with this version, very annoying. I played 15 hours, just to give it a fair chance, then I gave up. The disk will be forgotten in a drawer, too bad."
4,Class chiller thriller that's less horrific than expected.,"Inventive and original and stunningly shot, this chiller is less in your face than you might expect from a Tartan Extreme (UK) release and is as much a who done it as a what done it.Ex-cop turned store detective investigates a series of murders in the soon to open shop. Investigations hinge on deaths in a mysterious fire months previously. Are the murders revenge for those deaths because the company is witholding compensation? Is it actually the ghosts of the dead haunting the store?Throw in some dodgy share dealing, the ex-cop with a history and a quite unexpected and not a little bit chilling final twist and it all adds up to a supremely satisfying experience that withstands repeated viewing."
5,This mic rocks,"I bought this for my Sony DVD-505 because I wanted all the gadgets I could get my hands on. After using it once, I want to use it all the time. It does everything the sales pitch says it does. Works great over 100 feet away. On the 505, comes through as center channel while on-board 4 mics pick up everything else. (A very cool effect).The remote mic isn't as cumbersome as some other reviews I have read said it was. In fact, it's easy to conceal.I would recomend this wireless mic to anyone who wants to get every drop out of their surround sound camera. Playback on surround sound theater set-up makes your movie way more interesting."
1,terrible purchase,I am so sorry to say that these ripped as I was putting them on the first time. Do not waste your money!
1,so sad,"OMG..what happened to this firm? The hose themselves are great..the problem is with the waistband that doesn't hold the hose up. I bought in different sizes for myself and my bridesmaids and they had to be removed the day of my wedding because they fell down to our ankles. I'm so dissappointed in this you have no idea. I love these hose, but can't wear them...WHAT A RIP OFF!"
2,Short and sweet,"Nice story, but the ending, while happy, was strange. Obviously written during a time when there were few laws regarding custody of children."
3,"Sweet, simple story.","Sweet simple Christmas story involving some individuals who need and get some Christmas miracles. The story includes estranged siblings, an abused orphan and the Christmas angel that brings them together."
3,"Must give Blotch credit,, but I think the movie is better","The movie is more relateble to he Psycho I,,,, Anyway this is pretty good it has the classic touch, it is event sead just like Alferd Hitchcock did this inspired Psycho II,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The differnce here is Norman is more cold blood guy, Mother isnt in it thoe 22 years of mental rehab payed off it seemed like.In the movie,, Norman is him nice,tender self if your nice to him and his motel, and mother hs a big play."
5,Welcome Back Annaliz!!!,"Welcome Back Annaliz! Ethel Stockton did it again with her sequel to ""Old is a Four Letter Word"". Annaliz is a delightful free spirit who shares her positive wisdom on aging throughout every chapter. She lets us know from beginning to end that life is full fun and dreams do come true. Annaliz plants a seed that grows in ones soul. A true heart grabber that gives every reader something to chew on for a long long time after turning the final page. Both ""Old is a Four Letter Word"" & ""Older is Better"" are books you just can't wait to share."
3,Now if only it loaded cleanly...,"I remember staying up for a month playing these games when they first came out... They were just that fun. To those who would nay-say, let me give you some advice: work yourself to the point where you're nearly passing out from lack of sleep, grab a cup of coffee, and start playing P2. When the little rodent starts talking to you from nowhere, tell me you don't jump out of your skin and I just may have to call you a liar. Then again... It has been years since I last played. :) My only complaint with this set was that I had an extremely difficult time getting the game to run on my (apparently) too buff system... DX9 and P1/2 just don't like each other."
4,"uhhh, I don't know","When I recieved this game, it only included the 7 CDs from the original adventure. The game was supposed to come with all 12 CDs. What do I do to fix this?"
4,Great product for clearing windows,"Bought this for my car to clear dew and rain off my side windows and mirrors. Works great, and I've ended up using it on my car and in my bathroom.The wide blade makes clearing the condensation from my windows very quick, and since it's flexible, it conforms to the shape of the window. It also makes it easy to clear off condensation from side-view mirrors, which is hard to do with standard squeegees."
3,Diana Deserves a historical biography on DVD,"Why is it so difficult to find film biographies on Lena Horne and Diana Ross? Both are African American divas, legends and icons. Recently BET television station has featured unsung divas including one of the Supremes. However,Diana Ross has yet to be featured. If it wasn't for the recent death of Michael Jackson, a whole generation would not know who she is. Something definitely needs to be done about this.Cawallen"
2,Stroop Twist Board,"Brought tis item, did not find it too helpful for exercising want more of a workout, feet kept moving around as a I was twisting, not comfortable."
3,Naivete in high places,"Domville was an apparently brave man who loved his country, but took British Imperial power at face value and didn't understand how weak the Empire really was, and how American economic power made a weak (prewar) alliance with America more valuable than a tight naval alliance with Japan, which America got Britain to drop. Deprived of this understanding, he fell back on conspiracy theories. He also pursued German-British friendship into the Hitler era, which made him appear disloyal. His imprisonment, and that of the other ""18-b"" prisoners, was probably unnecessary."
4,Shark Gordon is awesome!,"This series was on Animal Planet and is well done - also not just about sharks and how frightening they are, Ian ""Shark"" Gordon is fearless and truly understands how these creatures think and react - and he's a character, too - very funny"
5,Mais Oui,"I loved this little book. I bought it for a friend but ended up keeping it for myself (and buying another one for her). It's a gem of a book that goes past all the silly stereotypes we're familiar with: yes, French women are all thin and they don't snack... but despite a few clichés, Entre Nous is a little glimpse into French culture - and more than that it focuses on the more intangible aspects of the French woman as a way of being. In a lighthanded way, Ollivier offers bits of sage advice (like how to slow down and have a life) to us multi-tasking Americans. Despite all the anti-French hype these days (""Freedom fries?"" - give me a break), French culture and particularly French women - timelessly represent something we equate with taste and allure. After reading Entre Nous I was craving a walk through a garden, a simple black dress and a candlelit bath..."
2,To much fluff,"Great personal account of life in France. However the book was too long and included to many superfluous excerpts from other books and movies. The over-comparisons of ""classy"" French Women vs. ""un-classy"" american's grew old quickly."
3,Guess I'm Not French,"I love slow meals and good clothes. But I guess I am too American. My ex-boyfriend lived in Europe for many years and told me I was a great disappointment to him. Because I was hurt when he slept with other women. And because I was only attracted to him, one man. Guess I have a real problem. I don't know why. Maybe it was the way I was raised, maybe it's low self-esteem, I don't know. But this made me think about how much I disappointed him. I don't know why accepting and allowing my man to have mistresses makes me a real woman. Guess I am just what he called me: a little girl in a woman's body."
3,"Light and Fluffy, fun and not too serious","First you have to get over calling French women, even of high intellectual calibre- girls. I have lived in France, and most of what Mme. Olivier holds up as ""French"" is really Parisian, just as what plays in NYC doesn't necessarily play in Peoria. The quotes and movie recommendations are worthwhile if you've had little exposure to French culture, again a bit on the light side. Overall, wait for the paperback and read it on the plane to Paris."
1,Painful,This book is incredibly TEDIOUS. Maybe because I ready after How to be imposibly french wich is great!.I find the little quotes and film notes more interesting than the book itself. But very distracting.
2,I actually finished watching this movie,When I was younger - I tried many times to finish this movie. With the release of 2.0 - I somehow finished watching it. The new features aren't worth the purchase due to the lack of quality that was inputted into this version. Nothing new besides the terrible CQ sequences that belong in a Playstation 1 game. Which - if I remember correctly - were two. SKIP.
4,The new version looks great,"This blu-ray actually has both the newly remastered version of the movie and an uprezzed version of the original movie. The remastered version of the movie which has been considerably enhanced with CG looks and sounds fantastic. The original version however looks terrible. If you are looking for the original version of the movie you might as well stick with the DVD. The English dub for the new version is a remix of the original one with new sound effects added in. Although the acting is a little flat, the sound quality of the dub is excellent. The Japanese audio sounds great too."
3,Why CGI?,"As much as I like the classic movie, the CGI in this version seems kinda... pointless. There really aren't that many scenes done inf Full CGI- at least not enough to make it worthwhile to remake the movie. I would rather have seen the entire film remastered in CGI. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge GITS fan- but remastering seems pretty much pointless for the few scenes they spliced in."
4,Fast delivery and product is just as described.,The product arrived very quickly. The minifuse is just as described and fits in my Acura RSX perfectly. I recommend this to anyone that needs this minifuse.
2,Dissapointing,"I read a review of this book in the Boston Globe and ordered it on Amazon immediately. It sounded fascinating, but overall the book turned out to be quite a dissapointment. I found Dr. Nuland's anecdotal descriptions of his surgical experiences riveting -- the stuff that keeps me tuning in to ""ER"" every Thursday night. Unfortunately, the true ""guts"" of the book, the history of mankind's understanding of the organs and how they work was very dry and at times repetitive. I wished that Dr. Nuland could have told the story of the discovery of the function of the liver, for example, with the same intensity as he described his first personal experience with open-heart surgery."
4,More charming hijinx from Yotsuba,"Yotsuba volume #3 still manages to delight with its simple vignettes chronicling the day to day adventures of precocious Yotsuba and her daily adventures experiencing life in sub-urban Japan. Volume #3 is interesting for its portrayal of unique aspects of day-to-day life in Japan such as the prominence of the Summer time fireworks festival along with the importance of bringing back 'souvenirs' to family and friends upon return from a journey somewhere.While the stories may seem lighter then air I still manage to remain highly impressed with Azuma's ability to strongly convey emotion and action through expressive facial artistry. Worth checking out for this factor alone, IMO."
4,Great Challege,I really enjoy each type of puzzle. Then seeing what the picture is when the puzzle is complete. I also liked the fact that after the puzzles are complete they each tell something about the picture and that the pictures are something located in the city that you are in. I think that the instructions are very good and I would recommend this to my friends.
4,Young Adult Book Turned Film!,"Many people have been waiting for this for a long time and now it's finally here! The SHOtime film version of Laurie Halse Anderson's extremely popular book ""Speak."" This was originally supposed to be released in October but with a faster date, maybe more people will be interested and start buying! So, this coming September, get ready for an anticipated release of a masterpiece novel!"
4,pretty good,over all this was a pretty good film. i've watched it with several others and they all agree its pretty good
1,You Took My Money and Never Sent It To Me!!!,I ended up finally getting to watch this movie on Lifetime. I ordered this movie from you AMAZON and You took my Money and Never Sent It. I was a regular customer however I have no trust anymore. No phone numbers to contact anyone???
5,Speak,"I loved the movie, the young actress kristen stewart was amazing the way she went from bright & cheerful to dark & morbid after being the victim of rape."
4,"nice but not much padding, not exactly level","Nice looking stool, easily assembled, decal looks good. Now the bad. Stool does not sit exactly level. There is a little bit of rocking when not sitting on the stool. Fortunately when you sit on it, it does seem pretty stable and the rocking disappears. The bad is that it doesn't have much padding. Maybe 1/8 in at most. Haven't sit that long on it, but I'm imagining it won't be that comfortable. I'll probably have to cut some memory foam and make my own seat cover, then I won't be able to see the nice decal."
5,Makes you wonder...,"This new novel by Daniel Quinn is certainly unlike any of his previous books in that it isn't a work of cultural critique, but is still thematically connected to his past works, such as Ishmael and The Story of B. This is the story of a young man who is obsessed with reincarnation, who finally finds what he believes to be the real thing, and how this discovery shatters his view of the world and sends him on a daunting mission to share what he's found with others. If you've read Daniel's other books, when you finish this one you'll see that we have much in common with the young man at the end of this book. This book was enjoyable, readable, and thoughtful. I would recommend it to any Quinn fans as well as anyone who simply wants to read a great book."
2,Disappointing,"While noble at heart and definitely carrying its ingenious moments, this book lacked in real depth and character growth/background. I was most disappointed with the hokey ending, utterly guessable and also the author's use of simplistic descriptive terminology. I've heard this book described as 'life altering', and 'deeply moving' and while I don't dismiss it altogether, I cannot imagine it classifying it as either when it merely plays on ideas which have been well versed in the past. A good short story at best."
1,You call THIS a love story???,"The boy interest in this movie, Solomon, is so selfish and so immature, that near the end of the movie, when Gaenor's brother is literally beating Solomon to death, you actually find yourself cheering for the brother to keep on beating and kicking Solomon into a dusty bloody pulp.I know this much: Here's what a love story is NOT: Immature teenagers illicitly rolling around in the hay together and then, when the moral payment for their actions comes due, behaving as self-centered teenagers must.Unfortunately, that's all that comprises this attrocious, gallingly pretensious movie."
5,home world rocks,"all right home world is about a quest to find your home planet id tell you more but i would end up giving it all away, but what i can tell you is that you can research build and capture ships which makes it really awsome.i got this a long time ago but i think that it is so awsome that i still play it trust me youll love this game."
4,Well worth your time and money,"I've been a somewhat lukewarm fan of RTS games over the past few years in that I've played them, and enjoyed them more than most other genres, but never really felt compelled to complete them when I ran into difficulties.This game is different.It's at least as hard to get through as any other RTS I've ever played, but it's so involving that I'm willing to go back over and over again to complete the mission and go on to the next episode in the story. It's gritty, yet beautiful.The interface is not the easiest thing in the world to master, and I could suggest some improvements. Movement of ships over long distances can be a hassle. I didn't have too many problems with camera management, but in the chaos of battle I used the Pause function many times to try and sort out my forces. Playing this game does require some eye-hand-mouse coordination, more so than a lot of RTSs I've played.But I think the gameplay and storyline make it well worth those small few glitches."
2,Not what I expected,"I received this item for my baby shower after reading the wonderful reviews it had received. It's beautiful to look at but a few important features were left out.There is no leg support, if your child wants to lay down for a nap, his little legs will have to dangle down.The way that the stroller reclines is by a cord, you need two hands to make the seat go into an upright position.It's not as lite as I thought it would be. It's definetly lighter than a Graco but its still heavier than comparable strollers.I have a Zooper stroller from my son who is now four. I have already replaced the seat and will just call to have the new tires sent. The zooper comes with a full leg cover and rain cover. The only thing I don't like about my 2001 Zooper is that the basket is so small, but I believe the newer models have easier access and bigger baskets. Its also lighter and folds smaller than the Inglesina."
3,Nice little stroller,"I bought this stroller as a second stroller for my twins (it's nice to have a single stroller even with twins) and liked how this one worked out. It is very nice looking with plush material and modern design and the reclining position worked great with my 10 pound baby and was very comfortable for her and she fell right to sleep. It is easy to steer with one hand and folded down easily. The only reason I didn't give it more stars is because I think it's a little over priced because it's very light, to the point of not feeling substantial but we'll see how well it holds up with more wear and tear."
2,"Cheap Quality, Misleading weapons. Definitely Not Worth the Price","When I opened this product I must admit I was very disappointed. The ""weapons"" they talk about are pieces of painted rubber and foam. I did like the arm blade, but from the description it seemed that I would be getting plastic strap on weapons as opposed to rubber and foam material that is supposed to look like weapons. Furthermore, the rubber cords used to fasten it onto the body look a bit flimsy to me.Now mind you this is a good costume for $30, but for $60, I feel very ripped off and a bit deceived about the weapons. I do like the look of the vinyl coat, though I wish it was full sleeve on both sides."
2,Too sharp!,"I bought this knife to use at my mother-in-law's house when we visit so I can cut grapefruit. Unfortunately, it has the same problem that so many grapefruit knives have - its large, sharp serrations make the knife too sharp, so that the blade easily cuts through the membrane. Good grapefruit knives, which are hard to find, have tiny serrations that are not that sharp, so that when you are cutting the sections, you can go right up to the membrane without the fear of cutting through it. The Norpro fails this test."
4,A must have for fans of the show,"The extras are nice, but could use more. It is great to have all the episodes in a cool little package."
2,There's Better Out There,"I was expecting so much more from this game. I Betrayal at Antara was so much better. I bought RTK anticipating an even better experience. At first, I was pleased. The Gfx and Sfx are good. Moving about gets frustrating though since the controls are not intuitive and you quickly find yourself moving back and forth between screens. There are some instances where you simply can't see all of a screen at all. My biggest complaint though was that just as I was beginning to really get into the plot, the game ended! I was completely shocked. It was as if the developers simply reached a deadline and just ended the game. There were many loose ends regarding the plot. I wondered whether or not this meant another sequel is forthcoming. I won't buy it!"
4,My Favorite Plates,"What I love about these is that they are sturdy (well crafted), heavy enough to proove thier price, as well as beautiful without being overstated. The only downside is that the white base does get marked up with stacking, cutting, etc. This does not bother me, but some folks are more particular than I am. These are large enough to hold a good size supper. I use them everyday and find replacements fairly easy and inexpensive (they do not break easily, but with children and a tile kitchen floor.... it happens)."
5,Huge money saver.,"This book is great and saved me thousands of dollars. I was about to hire a company to dig out around my house to repair basement leaks, but luckily I read this book first. I was able to do a few simple repairs to my gutters (turns out my downspouts were not going away from my house) and make a few other easy landscaping changes and the leaking stopped.I would strongly suggest making the small investment to educate yourself on what is causing the leaks (which this book will do with example photos) before having a company come in and dig up your yard for thousands of dollars (trust me, that was their only suggestion)."
5,ATTENTION SNIPERS/USER OF THE SCOPE,The thunder pack is great but the scopes little light gives off your position and the glare from the sun messes it up YOU CANT SEE AT ALL ON A SUNNY DAY it works perfectly in RIGHT conditions
5,Great Product- just a bit dissapointing-But a MUST HAVE!,"Ok, i got my Deluxe on X-Mas (thanks,mom!) and i was in the basement with my bro, rdy to have a war. He won, then i, and so forth. later, when it was warm out, we played autside. We realised we couldnt hit crap! So, I bought this scope. On the car-ride home, i opened it, and noticed the scope didnt even zoom in! I thought ' what a waste of 10$'. So, i put it to the test. Amazed as I was, it EASLY improved my accuracy about 70-90%! I was amazed! Now, for all u llto people, u need this for the deluxe ( i heard it wasnt as much needed for the irx-2x (whatever its called)). Anyway, if ur looking for a zoom scope, buy one of those plastic toy ones, cut of 1 end, and tape it on ur gun. But, this is great for me :)."
2,Looks can be deceiving,"The seller should at least put an actual V3 phone IN the case for the ad display. You don't see until you get it that it doesn't actually cover/protect the camera lens--nor does it protect the LCD display on the front of the phone. What's the point of a cover then?? Its also not very ""clear"". The cool pink color of my phone is completely blocked out by the white of the case. This product is ugly, and i don't recommend it."
5,HEAVY DUTY STARTER REVIEW,I HAVE PURCHASED AND INSTALLED SEVERAL OF THESE USA INDUSTRIES 3510 STARTERS ON PERFORMANCE CARS AND THEY WERE EXCELLENT QUALITY AND ALWAYS WORKED.I EVEN USE ONE ON MY ALCOHOL INJECTED RACE CAR WITH 14:1 COMPRESSION SO I'M SURE THEY WILL BE MORE THAN SATISFACTORY FOR NORMAL USE. I RECOMMEND THIS BRAND TO ALL MY FRIENDS BECAUSE OF THE QUALITY.
5,Macross!,"Okay....to keep this short, let me say up-front that I am not an anime geek. All I want to add is that for us normal folks that grew up watching these shows after school, it's great to be able to see them again. The characters haven't changed or had a ""re-boot"" to something that isn't recognizable. Beautiful art, complex characters and a love triangle that makes some soap operas look like 5 year-olds playing a sand box. There's no point in griping about what it isn't, I think it's always better to appreciate it for what it is: A space opera...hope this helps."
2,"""And Then There Were None...""","Dr. David E. Stannard has taken part of the topic penned by Alan Moorhead in ""Fatal Impact"" and analyzed specifically the impact that foreign contact had on the people and environment of the Hawaiian Islands. In spite of the thesis-spoken language of this book (indeed it is part of a larger scholarly work), any student of Hawaiian history would do well to wade through the information and conclusions that Dr. Stannard presents.If Dr. Stannard is correct in his projections of population sizes in Hawaii, pre-Western contact, the accidental and purposeful introduction of foreign disease wrought destruction of a scale not comprehended by most students of Pacific history. A careful read of this work is warranted and a careful reflection of his data and analysis will give the reader a more significant appreciation of Hawaii's history."
3,there's a girl in my hammerlock,Maisie Potter starts out for cheerleading try outs. The coach says that she wasn't stiff enough. Maisie decides that her toughness can work on the wrestling team. She makes the team. There is a guy on the team that she likes. She also wins the championships. I GIVE MY BOOK A FOUR STAR RECCOMENDATION. It was a realistic story that I believe any 14/15 year old girl can relate to. The plot was profoundly good. It shows what can happen when you stick with what you wanna do. Regardless of what anyone says.
2,It depressed and imbarressed me.,"I gave this book only two stars because it depressed me, It made me feel like if you are brave enough to try something new, then only negative cosequences occur. Well I have to admit she did strengthen her relationship with her mother which is more important than losing the people you thought were your friends. But it is extremly depressing."
4,a great box set for rock n roll memories.,Now if you really enjoy original songs from the start of Rock n Roll then this box set is a must have for you.
3,Be warned,"Excellent product if all you plan to do is: 1) compose your digital photos via the viewing screen, or 2) Review your shots in bright sunlight.For me, however, found very awkward. if you plan to use the ""old fashion"" eye level view finder then not very useful. Gets in the way of using the eye level view finder. Have to use both hands to fold down the pop-up shade. Maybe if it offered one-handed folding capabilities would be much better. Good concept, just awkward.//Don"
1,Disappointment,"I ordered the clock as a birthday gift for my 10-year-old nephew, who happens to be a baseball enthusiast and lives on the other side of the continent. Unfortunately, it arrived broken. When I phoned Amazon, at first I was told that to fix this problem we would have to do the following: 1) my brother (my nephew's father) would have to return the clock and pay the return postage; 2) I would be issued a refund; 3) I would then have to re-order the clock. When I pointed out that it wasn't fair that we should pay the postage to return a broken item, the clerk agreed and told me that she would send my brother an email that included a postage stamp that he should glue on the package when he returned it. In the end, however, my brother never received this email but I did receive a refund and simply bought a gift certificate for my nephew instead. I wonder if he can now throw the clock away?"
5,A book for our times,"This is a wonderful book, which gently conveys a message about learning to appreciate neighbors who at first seem irritatingly different. This book speaks to the importance of living in harmony with others, and understanding and liking our neighbors even when there seem to be differences between us. Moms and dads (and aunts and uncles and grandmas and granddads) who would like to talk with youngsters about peace, and friendship, and trust, and kindness, and acceptance, should be buying this book. (Or borrow it from your library!) This is an excellent book to share with children in light of what is going on in the world today."
1,Adaptec AVC-3610 Dual TV Turner PVR Kit,"Please beware; this product does not plug and play for my computer: Inspiron E1505 support by Microsoft EXP. Also the installation diskette does not install a driver, in order to facilitate use of same product. In addition a message related Microsoft Media Center generally appears, however I was unsuccessful in searching the internet for a suitable driver for same external TV tuner. It is very unfortunate that Amazon is associated with this product. I would appreciate some level of technical support regarding same product in order to have the intended service."
5,AJ can't find a coherent bassline w/ 2hands and a flashlight,Quality work! Great compositions with unique instrumentation. This AJ Blackman is obviously an uneducated musician.
4,This Book has Some Good Information,"This book has some good information with ways of getting around having a prescription. However, with new sources of medicine available online, much of this information is no longer necessary. The book writer has done his research. It just needs to be updated."
2,Do it yourself medicine,This book does not contain specific useful information. It is mostly a rambling narative which is very vague and doesn't contain the information claimed on the cover.
1,poor battery placement,"I repeatedly, inadvertently opened the back when trying to put the pedometer on my waistband. The back was very difficult to close and way too easy to open. It worked its way off my waistband several times resulting in it landing on the ground, the back flying open and the battery popping out. Guess what this did to my counts. Don't buy it."
2,"This is not the best, at all","I've read three Adrien English mysteries and this was definitely not one of the best. There seems to be this awkward juxtaposition between the mystery story line and the personal story line which doesn't jive at all. I got the impression Lanyon wrote a novel about Adrien and then threw in murder just so it could be called a mystery. There are time line issues which, when you think about them, make you question ""just how long ago did that happen?"" Adrien, himself, is a problem. I didn't think he was very likable, everything seems to make him whine and complain. In fact, the only time he comes across as mildly pleasant is when he's had too much to drink. Of course, this may have been a prelude to issues in the fourth mystery, but at this point I don't really care."
1,WIRELESS SYSTEM,"I PREVIOUSLY EXPRESSED MY DISSATISFACTION WITH THIS PRODUCT AND ASKED FOR RETURN AUTHORIZATION.I RECEIVED ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTION FROM QIMING LI, AND WHICH I ATTEMPTED TO GET THE ITEM WORKING TO NO AVAIL.AGAIN, I ASK FOR RETURN AUTORIZATION!!!!"
4,Fairly good,"Overall they are pretty good. I use them to listen to internet broadcasts from a remote location. You will have to experiment with the location of the sending and receiving units and their placements to get the best sound. It seems they are sensitive to various items, IE pipes, telephones, etc. so it may take a bit of time to get the best results. The longest I have listened continuously for is about 2.5 to 3.0 hours and the battery did not fail. I am glad I purchased them."
4,Great actual gameplay,"Just because this game does not have a good franchise mode does not mean that it should be regarded as a one or two star game. I found that the graphics were awesome and the exhibition games were great. This game can be good for many hours of non franchise fun. The seasons are not that bad just because you cant make more players or teams and you cant carry on seasons. Microsoft spent a lot more time on graphics and gameplay than frachise mode, the opposite tactics of the NBA Live Creaters: EA Sports.This game is not a 3 star game. Worth about 4.5, i think i should give it a 4 because it does not display the qualities of a 5 star game."
2,Not Pleased,"This game is terrible! NBA Live 97, 98, 99... (EA Sports)are much better. Insidedrive gives the minimum gameplay options, only season, playoff, single game, and practice modes. No custom teams or players. I was stupid by not returning it."
2,Horrible,"OK I'm a GM type of person, but I can't update the rosters. I think NBA Live '98 is better. It's just plain horrible."
2,If you've never played it might teach you something.,If you know what AA23ds means this book isn't for you. If you've never played O/8b then it's worth picking up.
3,Design Flaw,"Corelle is awesome when it comes to kitchen sets that don't break easily (or even at all)... but their designs are flawed.I have noticed that the designs on these plates scrape off easier than they should and that is very disappointing. I am having this problem with all of their current models.Corelle, I am mad at you."
4,value for your money,Great value for your money and doesn't break too quickly either.Great to use everyday and dishwasher safe. Great for kids
5,Glad my stoneware dishes are gone!,I was so happy to get rid of my stoneware dishes. They were heavy and they broke occasionally if I dropped them. Corelle is light and washes so easy. And I threw one of the floor and it didin't break. This pattern is so pretty too.
5,"Beautiful set, teeny plate","I like the set well enough, but it does not come with a lunch plate, only a tiny dessert plate. I WISH I could buy pieces separately. Who needs another 4 mugs!? I do need dessert plates, but I ALSO need lunch plates....so I mixed and matched. I got 2 of these and to with the Rolo pattern. Compromise."
1,lousey packing,Two of the plates were broken and a bowl wad broken...they were not packed well at all. I nought the dishes for a Christmas gift...very disappointed.
5,My favorite book when I was little,My father wrote this book for me when I was a little girl and I grew up with all the big stuffed animals in our house. This one started out as one of my bed time stories. Every night we would get the latest chapter of the story and would make up new characters. Eventually he put it all down in a book. It is pretty neat to see that my Dad now has a cult following of his books:-) He would be thrilled to know that folks still read his books after all these years!
1,spider baddy,"There are a lot of good movies for children under 5, but this is not one of them. A few laughs due to amateurism alla Ed Wood, but after 5 minutes you can go to hell, thank you. I reject the term 'cult movie' as if I needed a degree in order to see the goodness in boring movies with hidden values. A lot of extras for family members though, which must be the ones rating this item with 5 stars."
3,These cuties pack a sting,"Pretty good horror/black comedy has its weird and surreal moments, but is otherwise not all that much out of the mainstream, at least the drive-in movie mainstream. Worth a view for the general weirdness, Lon Chaney's sensitive performance, and the two cute actresses who play the deranged young women Chaney's caretaker character watches over. The print on this Image Entertainment DVD is quite good, and there are some interesting extras. The memorable ""X-Files"" episode featuring the extremely grotesque hillbilly family suffering from all kinds of in-breeding problems owes a lot to this movie, as does the film ""Deliverance"", whose strange, scary, and bald banjo-playing weirdo is almost an exact duplicate of the ""Ralph"" character here. ""Spider Baby"" is the perfect choice if you're in the mood for something a little off the beaten track."
2,Ultraviolet sucks,Ultraviolet is not compatible with iTunes and you can only watch moves with ultraviolet if you are streaming. well what if i have no internet connection?? lame
4,Twisted but fun!,"Okay, if you've looked into getting this movie you have to realize this is sorta a big single finger flying in the sky from the 'hair bands' of the 80's towards everyone else!! This takes all the twisted sex/drugs/rock and roll craziness that was the 80's and flaunts it out for everyone and says 'Yeah, we were drunk, drugged and screwing anything we could nail, but DArN it, WE HAD FUN!!' If you're looking for mindless entertainment and enjoyed the 80's music - check it out. If you don't like 80's hair band music and don't like laughing at/making fun of what life was like back then (yes, I graduated high school mid 80's), then go rent/buy/see something else."
3,OK,"It was pretty cheesy! It definitely wasn't what we expected. The music was good though, but the acting, was mediocre, especially when such high esteemed actors were supposed to be in it!"
3,"Fun and catchy, but not compelling","The songs were fun, but the story line predictable. There was nothing about it that really stood out. Not quite enough stereotypes to be really fun y"
2,Lame!,Really disappointed! I realize it was supposed to be a musical but even from that perspective it was disappointing. Especially with an all star cast!
2,bored stiff as a rock,"I heard so many great things about the musical on Broadway that I had higher expectations for the movie. This is classic example of when a play / live show does NOT translate to the big screen. The music was tolerable but it felt like everyone was ""calling in"" their performances."
2,Wanted less of a musical,"Loved the classic rock but would have enjoyed stage performances from the headliners instead of using the music as communication between characters, ugh!"
2,Not fot me,If you like late 80's early 90's rock or the dream of being a rock star. You would enjoy this movie. But it was not for me.
2,Was not expecting a musical!,"Ok, maybe it's my fault. I guess I didn't pay enough attention to the trailers. But I never noticed that this movie was going to be full of people singing songs throughout! And yes, I knew it was ""based on"" an actual musical. Anyway, I was really excited to watch this movie, given all the great celebrities in it. I even made my husband watch it with me. Now I need to figure out how to give him those two hours back that he wasted watching this with me. I'm in trouble! LOL. The stars are still great, and the music is actually pretty good - love the 80's! But it was not what I was expecting, hence the 2 stars."
1,horrible movie,"this movie runined so many good song.. the plot was horrible, and for alot of well known actors it in.. i was mighty disappointed.."
2,Was this supposed to be a comedy?,"Ouch! Is all I can say. I lost my movie picking privileges with my husband after choosing this one. This movie was so cheesy and painful to the ears, that I thought maybe they meant for it to be a parody of the broadway show. Russel Brandt and Alec Baldwin need to stick with comedy and stay out of the recording booth. I'm surprised to say that the best part of the movie wasTom Cruise, who put on a fantastic performance and can actually sing.Looks like it's all action and sports movies for me for awhile. Thanks Rock of Ages."
1,Movie,It just wasn't what I expected. I did love every song that they sang though. I wasn't expecting a musical.
2,It was okay,I think this movie was over rated. I guess we were expecting at least some of the real band members to appear in this movie.
2,Can you say Cheesy?,I know this was supposed to be campy but it really was hard to get through. Julianne Hough has a great voice and I like her. The acting was good but the script and all the rest blew what this could have been.
4,"Fun for the music with a plot, um, maybe no plot","If you like 80's hair rock and references galore - this movie is for you. Soundtrack is solid, performances are classic and the hidden references rock on. As for a plot. Just enjoy the music and references of rocks ""second"" golden age!"
5,"Great Cast, Great Songs, Great Movie!","I've purchased several now for friends who all give this film the same great review. Just like being back in the Rock Crazed world of long hair, torn jeans and wild inocent rebellion. Very competitive priced at Amazon.com. Fast delivery, too!"
1,Lame turkey MUSICAL,"I was so exited about this movie, and it is so bad ..... think hair-metal bands meets "" GREASE "", this is one stupid, stupid movie . I HATE MUSICALS ! They are constantly breaking into songs, (and ruining them). I guess if You like GLEE, or GREASE, and you like hair-metal songs sung in a pop way by teenage girls, go nuts ! ( otherwise, watch ROCK STAR or THE ROCKER, or AIRHEADS !"
2,"Bad story, overall not good","I knew this movie was not highly rated, but it was a lot worse than I expected. I was torn between giving it 1 star and 2, but I went with 2 because some of the singing is very good. The story is just a stupid as can be, though. Tom Cruise does a good job of singing, although I don't think I saw any evidence of his supposed 5-octave range. There are some other good singers, too, although I didn't think the female lead had a very good voice. Overall a weird movie with a couple of redeeming qualities."
3,Tom Cruise is the man,"Without Tom Cruise this movie would have been in the theaters 2 days instead of 3. He plays the rocker really well and sounds the best singing the songs. Too much singing throughout the movie in my opinion.Julianne Hough sounds like a chipmunk, pretty lame."
4,Quirky movie,This is your typical girl loves boy movie however the twist with Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand make this movie............I would have rated it 3 stars if it were not for them!
4,Brought me back some.,A movie / musical... not what I'm usually used to but I liked the movie overall. Cruise was good in this as well.
3,Mildy Amusing,"Being a child of the 80's I enjoyed the soundtrack. Beyond that, I found the plot vaguely uninspiring, the musical aspects ranging from somewhat amusing to fairly irritating, and the Russel Brand love story completely superfluous. Tom Cruise as Stacey Jaxx was a throwback to his Bob Seger Lip-Sync days albeit slightly more moody, and Diego Boneta ""writing"" and ""performing"" Don't Stop Believin' was... well... completely unbelievable. :-PProps for some good crossover mixes and a good 80's vibe, but all in all, I'd just as soon blast the songs on my car stereo and sing along to them on my way to or from work."
5,Brings the 80's back to life,This is a really good movie for us older generation. A love story musical with hot 80's music. I rated this high because it brings back the good old days.
1,Stupid,"I was really just unimpressed with this movie, I didn't even bother watching the whole thing, I'm glad I rented it, instead of buying it. Waste of time in my opinion."
3,80's,Kinda corny but it passed my time on a layover flight. Tom C looks great and the music is fun. Brings back memories.
3,Was just Ok music was good.,I really liked the music in it and thought Tom Cruise did a really good job. Was surprised how well he could sing.
4,Better than expected,Funnier than I thought it would be. Some excellent performances - a fun way to spend a couple of hours.
1,ouch!,"I grew up in the 80's and love all kinds of music from the era... that being said, I found only two words describe this movie. PAIN. FULL.I couldn't get through it and turned it off half way through....The singing was on par with mid-level local karaoke (but with far less passion that your average drunkard reliving his/her glory years at the local bar) and the acting and the story line was just plain bad. And all from big name stars, no less.I suppose the fact that I find most musicals difficult to watch - and the fact that I didn't realize this whole movie was a musical - meant my experience was doomed from the start...So, unless you're a huge fan of musicals and hair bands, I'd listen to the critics who panned it and avoid..."
5,Awesome!!!!!,I watched it three times in a row!!!! The music was GREAT!!!!!! Alex Baldwin and Tom Cruse were a RIOT !!!!!!!!
4,Good but buy the Blu-ray,"I love this movie so my 4 stars are because the regular DVD does not have the extras that apparently the Blu-ray does. I wanted to see the deleted scenes- some of which are alluded to in the trailer, but they are not on this version. Still great movie."
4,Totally entertained,"This movie was funny, cheezy, and had a great soundtrack. I loved Tom Cruise in it and I haven't been on his bandwagon for quite some time. It was good to see him play this cheezy weirdo/diva."
5,Rock of Ages,I was shocked at how great Tom Cruise could sing. No matter what that guy does he nails it every time!!!!
5,Rocked the rock of ages!,"This movie is INCREDIBLE - It's a musical - so please know- most of the movies are songs and music- all from the 80s- which I loved.The actors and actresses were soo soo incredibly talented- I'm sure voice equilizer was used (which some people have criticized) but with/without that - their voices were amazing- I ended up buying the soundtrack as well.It's fun to see the cosumes (also from the 80s) the way LA used to look and all of the fight and picketing that went along with that times.The storyline/plot is also quick moving, funny, and entertaining!mature audiences only- 17+sexual implicationsminimal swear/strong language"
3,"Entertaining, but no Oscar here","It was an okay movie for viewing once or twice, but I'm sorry I spent the money to purchase it. I should have just rented."
4,Good musical,I liked this movie. I wasn't sure I would considering I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan but I liked it. Tom Cruise was actually decent in this movie. I thought the love story was good and just the whole thing was pleasant and really good music. Would recommend to anyone.
3,corny but funny,Rock of ages was a cute little musical. Tom Cruise was a total rocker and it was hilarious to see him play such a fun roll. Alec Baldwin also played a great part. The movie had great casting.
1,This movie is just....gross.,"I'm pretty easy. I'll watch some really stupid movies and I'm easily entertained. This movie was stupid, as I anticipated it would be. But it was also just bad. And gross. I'm not very easily offended. I like crass, dark, even violent (sometimes) humor. Sometimes things just aren't funny. I got the impression from my mother that this movie was dumb, but worth watching. I actually found myself wishing I could have that time back. The last movie I remember feeling that way about was Ghost Rider...which was better...seriously. Don't pay money to watch this."
1,Rock of Ages,"This video has more crudity than has been mentioned. I thought it would be reminiscent of the 70 - 80s, but it was too cheesy."
3,Good Music,"If you are a child of the 80's, you will love this movie. Great music, not much of a storyline but that's how most musicals usually are."
5,Rock of ages,Just some great singing voices from top rate stars. Great music! The story line is a romance and a fight for what's yours to keep alive.
4,wow,"wow, not a big fan of musicals, and not realizing this was a musical until watching it. I have to say it was ok. I think the good music got me through it. I think all the actors really did a fantastic job. Tom Cruise did such a great job! And the comedy was ok too. Cant believe Alec Baldwin. What a character! So for the most part I was highly entertained. So I give it 4 stars."
4,ROCK OF AGES,"This movie was good fun. And it was certainly a new experience of Tom Cruise, so he can sing, and he does a good job doing it. :-) He is certainly a talented guy! I like musicals and there was certainly some good talent! I enjoyed it."
4,I wanna Rock!,The movie was good. But the reason it gets so many stars is because the music is awesome. Not a bad movie though.
4,OVER THE TOP & CAMPY ... BUT NONE THE LESS ENJOYABLE,"NOT SURE THE HISTORICALLY OVER-RATED CRUISE WAS THE RIGHT FIT IN THIS MOVIE ... BUT HE DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB PLAYING A BOOZE SOAKED & SEX CRAZED '80s HAIR METAL GOD. JULIANNE HOUGH, MALIN AKERMAN, ALEC BALDWIN, PAUL GIAMATTI, AND RUSSELL BRAND DID A NICE JOB, AS DID CATHERINE ZETA-JONES IN A SECONDARY ROLE ... THE STRENGTH OF THIS FILM IS THE MUSIC ... TOP NOTCH '80s HAIR METAL & ROCK ... WHICH SOUNDED SUPERB ON THE THEATRE'S SOUND SYSTEM !"
2,Watch something else,"Horrible movie, although Tommy boy did sound pretty good on the mic. Not to mention, the service cut of 3/4 of the way though the movie! $ better spent watching something else."
2,Good music...awful movie,"I really wanted to love this movie since I grew up listening to the music in it. However, the acting was horrible and there wasn't really a strong storyline. I'm no prude but this movie had a couple of very unnecessary parts in it that were just thrown in without any reason. I would not recommend this movie. Buy the songs by the original artists and skip this waste of time. The music was the only reason I gave the movie 2 stars. Otherwise, it truly doesn't even deserve one star."
1,Horrble,It has been a long time since I have seen a movie this bad. I thought it would be campy and funny because it was so cheesy- no it was just bad writing and bad acting with a bad plot. Steer clear of this steaming pile.
2,Rock of Ages: ho hum,"script was terrible, singing was great. Tom Cruise was awesome. the male lead (not TC) was also very unengaging. Could have used more Russell Brand to heighten the campiness."
2,Better things to spend money on.,"Not my kind of movie. It was all over the place. Very Hollywood with lots of Hollywood style antics. I like movies with a touch of substance. Dancers were all beautiful though and so is Catherine Zeta Jones, always great energy and sexy."
3,Good Movie,"Movie was good but there are a few spots in the movie where the movie is not working right, it shuffles then plays fine."
3,Only for Tom Cruise.,I wanted to see Tom in a role that was out of his action element. He plays this part to a T. I don't care for the casting that was chosen for the two main young singers and alas they take up most of the movie. I would definitely love to see Tom play something similar like this again.
1,A poor imitation of the real thing,"I found this product from Spinmaster to be far inferior to the real Doodle Bear line of products from Play Along, which are higher quality, more fun, more durable and have more play value. This uglier imposter does not stand up to the real thing."
4,Gross but prefect,"I was smoking about half a pack per day, got 4mg one based on the fact, i smoked my first cigarette within a minute of waking up.Turns out 4mg is too strong for me. I can keep it in my mouth for only couple of minutes before I would start feeling dizzy or sick. No big deal as I would just spit it out.Now taste is gross but that's the best part. I had read that you can get addicted to these lozenges... but these are so gross that I highly doubt it can happen.It's been about a week, I have had only 2 regular cigarettes since then. I might have had 4 or 5 of these lozenges."
4,So I'm not the only one who can't quit commit!,"I was a heavy smoker for 32 years. I tried the patch, but was alergic to the glue. I then used the inhaler, which really got me through the bad times. I switched to commit, but like the other reviewers, I'm having a hard time giving up the commit. I still want the commit when I crave a cigarette, but don't really want a cigarette as much as the commit! Weird, huh? At least it's safer and cleaner than smoking. I think I'll finally let it go when I'm ready."
4,So far so good!,"I have been smoking for twelve years, about a pack a day. I have tried quitting 7-8 times with no long term success. The patches make me feel horrible, the gums make my jaw ache, and the Wellbutrin caused me seizure (don't try it if you are small)!Today I took my first Commit 4 mg Lozenges, so far it works very fast with no side effects. I only uses them when I really crave a ciggarette, and I'm detemine to really quit this time.UPDATE - It's April, 2008, and I'm still commited to Commit. At least I'm not destroying my lungs with smoke anymore. Will try to quit Commit by the end of the month. Good luck!!"
3,Price is decent...,"I found this tea to be irritating on the stomach, even brewed ""lightly"". The taste was fine, but nothing special."
5,This book really won me over!,"I went into this book prepared to be somewhat annoyed by it. I think that was because the background of the author was so very different from myself (I'm not rich, I'm not Jewish, I don't have parents and in-laws flooding my children with lavish gifts). However, I was TOTALLY won over by the wonderful writing and extremely honesty of the author. She managed to find the common ground that I think all mothers (and especially mother who enjoy cooking, or who are going through dealing with illnesses of parents or in-laws) share. I laughed out loud over and over, and shed more than a few tears. It's so rare to find real honesty in writing, especially about motherhood--so many parents who write do so in such a poetic and glowing and ultimately fake way. If you are a parent, I think this is one worth reading."
4,"A Fun, Insightful Read","I love books that make me laugh out loud! This book brought to light many of the issues women who stay home with their children face. I loved Moses realism and frank descriptions. It was a light, fun read and I'm glad I stumbled upon it."
5,Excellent Reading!!!,Very good magazine with tips and update articles about health and fitness for women!
3,Don't fool by the Cover!,This is not what i have thought. This magazine much better two years ago. I just subscribed it a couple weeks ago and looking forward to learn some pictures techniques on fitness but there isn't much any more. I am pretty disappointed. I would try Oxygen or Runner magazines tho.
3,I f I was a 20 something,"Let me start out by saying if I was a 20 something this magazine might have a few tips. But ladies let's get real, you are who you are. Be the best you can be and love you mate the best you can. Life is short and you do not need a magazine telling you what you already know!"
2,great magazine.... if i ever receive it!!!,"Love Women's Health, but problems with my order from December.... it's now May and I've only received 2 magazines!! And one was a December mag that I didn't receive until beginning of Feb.... now tell me - if you order a magazine subscription in December, and they say you won't receive your first mag for 6-8 weeks, don't you think they'd at least start with January!!! After all - in December at the newsstand and bookstores, the magazines are all January's issue!Yeesh!"
1,Problem receiving refund,"I have cancelled this magazine after receiving the first and only issue I cared to view. For me, most of it was trash. After emails and calls, I finally received a refund of $9.10 after which I paid $14 initially to startthe subscription. For one issue, almost $5 doesn't seem to compute for canceling this as soon as the first issue arrived."
5,Great Reading! Came on time.,Great Reading! Came on time. after 30 days i already have 2 issues. Not sure why I recieved the December issue as I made the original purchase on Jan 1st. I would buy again!
3,womens health,"Pretty decent magazine, i wish it was less like the mens version, and overall different in structure, but they are really the same except one says women's and one says men's. but decent magazine."
3,Shady Subscription Company,"This is the best fitness magazine - great to use while working out (treadmill, eliptical trainer). The only problem is that the company itself is shady. I hardly received my copies of the magazine. I'd see in the grocery store way before it would arrive to my apartment. They also try to sell you products by sending them to your home as ""gifts,"" and then you learn that you have this large bill.I'll still buy the magazine, but I will never subscribe to them again!"
3,get what u pay for,very flimsy stick with proline if u need something strong there weaker than a stock body but if your just wantin style then this will work
5,A True Gem,"The West Wing is masterful. The stories, the characters, the actors. Aaron Sorkin is a true artist, as are the actors. The people that think this is a left-wing program are truly mistaken. The story line leans both ways. You won't be disappointed with the WestWing."
3,"A Nice Glass, But...","I ordered two of these quality DOF glasses but I was disappointed with the consistency in their creation. From a hand created crystal glass I expect a certain amount of variance, but these two glasses were so dissimilar if it weren't for the congruency in design I would have though one a knock off from another manufacturer.The state of the blue drop was the point of contention. On one glass the blue drop was roughly half the size of the other, and a different shape and depth into the glass. Assuming that there should be some degree of regularity to these pieces of art I found myself wanting a more consistent look so I returned them both."
5,Dino Lingo language learning program,My niece loves this. She would watch it not stop. It has been a huge help in her development. She loves Dino!
2,Basic Information only,"Soft-Hackled flies are coming of age. This book, written 25 years ago, is definately dated. Only basic flies were illistrated, and fishing techniques were limited. This book was more of a journal of fishing stories using soft-hackled flies than an information source"
5,I had the pleasure of fishing with syl over the years & he made me a better fly fisherman,"I am in several of syls books, and always enjoyed our time together, he was a great teacher & if you want to catch trout when everyone else is trying to match the hatch, you will be glad you read his book on Soft Hackles. I really miss him, and his fly patterns will always be part of my arsenal for trout no matter where I am fishing. Mike Caswell"
2,Well Made But May Not Work With Popular Bargman Plug,"Parts store sold me one of these saying it's better made than Bargman. Put this Pico recepticle on my truck and drove 90 minutes from home to where I store my trailer. First thing I noticed was I couldn't get the Bargman plug from my trailer to plug far enough in to be latched by the cover of the Pico. But I thought it was far enough in to work (the directionals worked.) Getting underway I found I had no trailer brakes (and no tail lights.) After 2 hours of trouble shooting, I found if I pushed hard on the plug and had someone else do all the switching and looking, I could get all functions to work. But as soon as I released my grip everything stopped working. Luckily I found a Bargman recepticle at a nearby Walmart that had a good RV department. The Pico metal parts do look higher quality but I would recommend checking to make sure they work with whatever you already have on your trailer or tow vehicle."
2,NOT A GOOD BOOK FOR BORDERLINES!,"I found this book, especially it's description of self-injury, to be EXTREMELY trigering. I couldn't help but take some of the examples in the book and put them to use. Although the book does provide some insight into the condition, this book is much more appropriate for families and friends of those with the condition than for the patient herself."
2,too generalized,"I didn't find this book very helpful. It was too generalized.Although the story of dreams which intercuts in between chapters is beautiful-highlights things well. A much better book is Christine Ann Lawson's ""Understanding the Borderline Mother Helping Her Children Transcend the Intense, Unpreditable, and Volatile Relationship.""Even though this may not sound like a very helpful title to borderlines seeking help, so far this is the best book I have read on the subject. I do believe borderline mothers will find helpful to recognizing their own parential behaviors. The book breaks down borderlines into four categories:the waif, the hermit, the queen, and the witch. But mainly it is an excellent book for breaking down the border character in a very concise way."
5,"Excellent, easy to read, informative","This is the third book on borderline personality disorder that I have read. It is the best, even better than the highly rated ""Elcipses"" in my opinion. Easy to read format, highly educational for those suffering from BPD, those who live with persons suffering from BPD, and mental healthcare workers working with BPD sufferers; and suffer they do! Please read this book!"
2,A trivialisation of a troubling disorder,"I was recommended this as the best book on Borderline Personality Disorder, if this is the best I worry about the worst.The author glosses over the whole subject, providing a facade of an in-depth examination of the disorder. Very little information or analysis is actually presented and that which is there is terribly shallow. The pat 'story' of the treatment of a hypothetical patient is deeply contrived, badly written and rather patronising.It is possible to read this book very quickly to get an overview of the disorder, but I would not expect too much from it. I find it ultimately trivial."
2,These are TOO small.,"I love this set, but it is too small and a pain in the butt to keep setting up. I wish it was bigger, it is so small that the little ball always gets lost."
3,Too much $$$,"Loved the music since I was a child; adore the ballet; however, this is far too much money for a 30 minute dvd..."
2,SURPRISINGLY DISSAPOINTING,"THIS BOOK SHOCKED ME! IT LOOKS THICK BUT, ONYL HALF OF THE BOOK IS ABOUT THE TITLE. THE OTHER HALF IN THE SECOND PARK TO ""THAT GANSTA SH*#"" OBVIOULSY THIS WAS A QUICK READ ,STORY LINE OK BUT OVERALL I WOULD NOT RECOMEND IT. I HAVE READ FLOWERS BED, AND NO REGRETS THEY WERE EXCELLENT I WAS TRULLY DISSAPOINTED."
2,Read the Spec Carefully,Read the specification carefully.The item is ONLY a countdown stopwatch. It is not a general stopwatch with countdown functionality.
4,Automatic shutoff is nice/Alarm not loud,I use this timer in my classroom and put it in my pocket. When I goes off it's not very loud and only I can hear it.I like the automatic shut off... wish the stopwatch I bought by Sportline would shut off as well.
4,Shelby Cobra,"Delivered as advertised,was a gift,they upgraded the delivery so I would get it on time at no additional charge. Product is very detailed and authentic"
3,kevin is funny.,"kevin james is a natural born comedian and a very talented writer. this series is naturally funny and situations are more believable than ""just shoot me""."
1,Price Increase! BOGUS,"I was looking on amazon for the seasons of King of Queens- and the other day, you could get season 1 & 2 together for $35!! Same for 3 & 4 and 5 & 6 and it pisses me off that I get on here today, and they are now $70 effin' dollars for both seasons together. WHAT THE HELL I am NOT paying 70 bucks for a DVD. Sorry, the show is good, not that good."
5,Wrong Approach,I think asking your acting teacher is the wrong way to approach this series. It is not about perfect acting but just comedy.And by the way an acting teacher who thinks it is necessary to really analize this series seems to take himself a bit too important.So for people who understand the real sense of comedy The King of Queens will be just perfect.
2,Everything is very small and cheaply made,The cups and saucers and very tiny and are easily bent. This seems to be more of that cheap china made garbage that some people peddle. The worst part of it is the size of all of the components.
3,"Very cute, but rather flimsy","This tea set comes nicely packaged and is so cute with different pictures on each plate, cup and saucer. However the tin is very thin and is very easily bent. Within a few day the tray and plates had been bent, and soon after the tea cups were crushed by the weight of a child. These are not much more durable than a soda can. I would expect more at this price."
4,"14 month old loves this set, very sturdy and safe","my little girl love george and this tea set, very sturdy and colorful, would recommend but take the teapot lid away till a bit older"
3,Dry and Dated,"The book covers the basics of employee involvement - from management, leadership, training, compensation, quality and the customer. Unfortunately, it's about 20 years old, and is pretty dry to read. There are some nuggets in here on organizational behavior and structure, as well as plenty of references to significant studies on employee relations that form the foundation for much of modern management theory. Unfortunately the writing style and the age of the material don't make it a compelling read."
5,You don't know Wolverine untill you've read this,"This comic is spectacular. A detailed, horrifying account of the creation of Weapon X. Parts of this comic seriously gave me the chills. A truly great read!"
3,average,"I got this because I wanted more power than my small butane torches have. This is highly recommended on alot of jewelry sites so I got one.While its a fine torch, its not any more powerful than my butane torches and thats a disappointment. I bought a regular torch and will be giving this away."
3,Its ok if you havent really done ballet workouts before,:) im on my bf's account so please dont think im male)(im a model and a i also do quite a bit of ballet on the side and i must say she is more a model who can stretch. I give this a 3 star because this is most likely targeted for the beginners so enjoy but for us advanced ballet workouters. there are better much much much better
4,An easy yet provocative read,"A deceptively simple yet challenging set of ideas. To read this book is easy -- to implement what this book proposes is the challenge. But the direction to which the authors point is right on the mark. I'm using it as a thought-challenge piece with my team -- how do WE become more kinetic? It will not be easy, but it is something our competitive environment is demanding."
5,Great Book!,"This book is very insightful. If you want to know anything about gems - how to care for them, where they come from, etc. - this book is a must. Highly recommended!"
4,Gems: A LIvely Guide...review,"This book is just what the title says - the author uses some humor and information is aimed toward a casual collector rather than a scientist or a super-rich collector. Besides the usual information about the make-up of a gemstone, there is also comparisons of the gem if it is found in more than one location, a bit of history of the discovery of a gemstone, and even a bit of information about the beliefs in the health benefits of some stones. It is not absolutely a complete guide, but more than just an overview of the main gems such as diamonds, sapphires, etc. The photos are very good, although not all are labeled."
3,No Nocturno Culto on that DVD!,"Even if the tracklist on the actual box cover listsTWO Darkthrone and one Satyricon songs, they are noton the DVD (at least here in Canada, and also from theofficial DVD setlist on Wacken webpage).Since many, like myself, will buy the DVD especiallyfor those ""historic"" live songs, this is kind of a let down.The rest of the show is all right."
5,Atomik Circus Rocks,"This CD is amazing, a great combination of songs. The bonus DVD alone makes the CD worth it."
3,Parson's Greek Tutor,"I love this program and would have given it five stars but when I got a new computer with Windows 7, it wouldn't work on it. I found no upgrade or fix on the Parson's website. It is a shame because it is a great program for a reasonable price. If you have Windows XP, it would work great."
1,junk!,When I ordered this liner it was 10.98. Now it is 5.99. It has no grommets which I didn't realize till I opened the package. It ripped in 1 month. Junk!
5,worth six stars,"a stunning, engrossing and wonderfully compassionate story magically told by a writing master. A must read for any adult and young adult."
2,Disappointed and frustrated,"I was disappointed and frustrated with this company. The main heading said 5 of these containers and then in smaller print it said only 4. Which I never saw and was frustrated by this. When I rec'd the product (yes in a timely manner), only 3 out of 4 were the correct item. They did send me a refund for the mistaken one. I am just unhappy with the 'smaller print' thing when the main heading says 5."
3,JeetLiner- Flight Simulator,"JetLiner is a fantastic flight simulator with airplanes models suchaas the 737-300, 747-400, 767-300, and the 777-200. The game is a very exciting ADD-ON TO MICROSOFT FLIGHT SIMULATOR. JetLiner's newcomers can do a shuttle or experienced players a long flight, facing many obstacles. Bad weather, fog, wind conditions... etc. I enjoyed the product, but buyer and gamer beware this game does NEED Microsoft Flight Simulaotr(s) 95 or 98. -CJK"
3,Good but a little spacey,"Robert Monroe takes you with him beyond the body into a reality which I found hard to understand. This is not about leaving your body and visiting loved ones who passed on, or visiting places that are close to the physical world. Robert takes you for wild rides out into the deep beyond. He sets up a vocabulary for the types of communications he has with the other beings he encounters which takes some getting used to. It is a little hard to follow his train of thought. I think the author struggles to communicate what he experienced.This is a book to be read after you've read some other introductory material, like his first book, or others like it. It consists of his travels beyond normal space and time into realms that are hard to define. You'll be scratching your head for sure. The stories were entertaining and got me to stop and think."
4,Star of David,I received my Star of David and it was just like they said iwear it every were i go and was very good price love it andwould buy again if needed some thing thanks good place to findbargons as need bargons as on low income soc God bless all andthanks for the post card they sent of Grand Palace from BangkokThailand and a very nice red potch to put it innever been there but looks real pretty place
1,Just don't stay in my ears,"To those who have taken the time to explain how you manage to keep these in your ears - thank you. I read your how-to's with care and tried my best to make these work.However, try as I might, these only stay in my ear for 5-10 minutes tops. They slowly work their way out and it isn't until I notice that my favorite bass heavy track is missing everything I listen to it for that I realize they've worked their way out again.I've replaced them with the Bose in-ear head phones Bose In-Ear Headphones which do much less to block out noise, but much more to maintain high quality sound regardless of whether they are inserted just right. I've also found the Bose in-ear headphones stay in when I'm riding riding trails with my mountain bike. I never tried riding with these Apple headphones as they don't stay in as I sit at my desk."
1,Disappointed,"I read the reviews before I bought this product. I worked in industry for years and am very familiar with how to insert earplugs so I figured these would work for me. Wrong! I tried each size and different positions, but never could get them to stay in my ears. In addition, the sound quality was not impressive. The stock buds that came with my ipod provide much better sound quality. The M9394G/B's have ""tinny"" high end response and the bass has no ""umph"" at all."
