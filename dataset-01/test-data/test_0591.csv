2,The Book of the Dead by Hank Harrison,"Funny how after a couple of decades, attitudes change! I bought this book back in 1981, I think, and didn't really like it all that much. There weren't ANY books about the Grateful Dead back then, except Harrison's initial '73 book ""The Dead"", so Dead Head expectations were pretty high for this book, as I recall. I remember the band being asked about this book during an interview and the official take was that they ""collectively"" thought it sucked. If you never toured with ""The Boys"" and want to learn about the Dead and that scene, I suggest reading these books: ""The Official Book of the Deadheads"" by Paul Gruskin; ""Playing In The Band"" by Blair & Regan Jackson; ""Searching for the Sound"" by Phil Lesh; and ""Long Strange Trip"" by Dennis McNally. If you really want to dig for more info on the Dead scene, check e-bay for old issues of ""The Golden Road"" (the best Grateful Dead fan 'zine published) or Relix issues from the '70's."
2,Not what I expected,"This is an OLD video. On the box it says 1989, but it really appears to be much older. It is informative and does teach some good techniques, but I just didn't feel it was sensual. I wanted something visually pleasing, yet not sleazy. This was just dull. The narrator sounded like he was stoned and it kept cutting into the massage to talk about the history of massage. I wanted to watch the video with my husband so we could try the techniques on eachother, but this video would just ruin the mood."
1,This video is a waste of time and money,"This vidoe lack focus, purpose, and direction. There is far to much ""tutorial"" content which does little to support the video title."
3,Intellitouch PT1 Tuner,"It took me a long time to get used to this tuner - I have many different brands of orchesteral tuners but I found this one very 'fidgety' to use and very insensitive to the guitar's lower E string.I now use it a lot more, as it is light and easy to stick in a guitar case - but only on only steel string acoustic guitars - it is hopeless on electric guitars.The battery does last a long time too because of it's neat timed shut off feature."
5,Outstanding!,"I picked up two of these, one for personal use and one for a friend's birthday present. I've yet to have a problem using mine, and haven't heard anything negative from my friend about his.This replaced my old quartz tuner that I fought with when trying to tune my guitar. With the old tuner you had to have a room that was perfectly quiet, the Intellitouch PT1 tunes perfectly in a noisy room. The backlight display helps in low light situations, and it's compact and clip on design makes it easy to carry around and just clip it on. It also folds back out of the way so you can leave it clipped on for easy retuning between songs.I highly recommend this product."
1,Commie crap,"This is a ridiculous propaganda cartoon aimed at discrediting the the opposition to communist infiltration of unions. It was also a veiled attack in people like Charles Lindbergh, Father Coughlin and Huey Long all prophets on the subversion and subsequent decline of America. I'm not a Bogart fan and he is only adequate here. The script portrays white workers concerned about unbridled immigration as racists and morons. Well...check the demographics of America, the strength of unions and the labels on everything you buy."
2,I'm not a big fan,"My daughter has very curly hair. I have to make her hair wet every morning just to be able to comb it. I hoped this spray would help and make her hair smell nice, but I got disappointed. The first time we used it we both thought it smells awfully. Its not a very strong scent, but to me it smelled nasty.As a detangler I would say its just ok.We dont use it no more."
4,Red Hot!,"Even before the enormous success of Fever and the super-catchy single ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" I've always firmly believed that Kylie Minogue is one of the world's best pop stars. Charisma, charm, and a tons of sexiness are just some of the qualities that she easily sells and constantly works to her advantage. Red Blooded Woman, the second single from her funky 9th studio album, Body Language, only further assures us of that.Although, it seems like this could be something more suited for R&B; acts such as Destiny's Child, Kylie easily proves that she can pull off R&B; with little or no effort. Her confident vocals, sexy purrs, and a keen taste for ultra-slick production are certainly evident here, as ""RBW"" is no doubt, one of the best R&B;/Dance singles of 2004 so far!This has major hit potential!"
3,a book for pinheads,"I am 43 and I found this book very good for me. It told me about the presidents. It told me that Bill Clinton is a good man. It told me that George W Bush is a bad man. It told me that Jon Buller is a smart man who knows on which side of his butter his bread is attached. I am a pinhead. I like simple books like this. And I agree with everything it has to say about George Washington and Clinton's cigar and full employment and family values and not telling lies. As I said, I am a pinhead, I am 43, and I found this book very good for me. Try it out on your kids, and they can become pinheads too."
5,Replica Vincent Valentine Cerberus pistol,"Its a lot smaller than I imagined! But still around 4-5 inches long, it has great detail. The chamber opens and you can examine the detail. The bullet chambers turn, and you can work the hammer. The trigger also articulates. It comes with a clear plastic stand which looks reasonably good. A nice piece! Fragile, for display only."
5,Beautiful,"I bought this watch for my brother for Christmas ... when I received it, it was even nicer looking that in the picture! It looks very nice and I'm amazed it's selling for such a good price. I will post more after Christmas when he opens it and takes it for a test drive ;)"
1,Stay away!,"Need a degree in order to use this program. Very un-user friendly, difficult and just plain horrible!"
3,Dissappointed,May be if you have been doing Pilates before you know how many props are required. I was dissappointed when I received the DVD but could not do the exersize because I did not have the props. Also it was hard to follow the first time I was doing the routine; however I could feel how some of the poses could be very useful
2,Not worth the time or money,"I have done this video once and will not do it again. It is indeed slow-paced and boring. I did not find Jennifer to be a good instructor. She doesn't explain the moves as she does them, hence you are having to constantly look at the tv rather than keep proper form and actually do the exercises correctly. It all seems to be inconsistent, and per the previous review, the left/right and counting is off. She also does not give many reminders to keep proper form, which for me is a biggie, as I tend to forget pretty easily. Because of this, my back was sore afterwards.Prepregnancy I was fit, and have been working out at the gym, so those who are not may get a little more out of this low-key workout, but some of the exercises will be impossible for you to do."
4,Great moves to Combat Pregnancy Pains,"I bought two pregancy videos---this one and The Perfect Pregnancy Workout. Perfect Pregancy is my main stay because I feel like it really works me out. This one is much more low key and easier to do, and I do this video about once or twice a week. I like it because I feel like it has good moves to help my back and hips to not hurt. Negatives are that it's not difficult enough for it to be my everyday workout. It has modifications for your third trimester. I've never done Pilates before, but I found it pretty easy to pick up. You need a small ball, a dowel (which I took apart my broom and used the stick portion), and 2-3 pound weights. Good video but better as a secondary workout."
2,Tedious,"Seems ok, but it is ridiculously long and doesn't seem that coherent. It jumps around a lot and makes you feel like it is taking FOREVER. I am 34 weeks and this is just not helpful to me. I find it annoying. Plus, you need all sorts of weird equipment. For example, a long stick?? Now where would I get that? Weird. I would get the 10minute pilates solution before this one for sure. I've done pilates with an instructor on the equipment, but can't afford anymore...so the principles of pilates seem to be there, but overall the workout is tedious. If you have lots of time and don't mind the jumping from random exercise to exercise without much flow, then this isn't THAT bad."
2,It wasn't as good as I thought it would be.,It was okay but I really didn't like it. It was WAY too much like #30. I was hoping that Tom's yeerk would die. I also didn't like it because it wasn't a big battle. The whole book revolved around Jake's family.
1,It was to simple compared to the other books...,"I've been reading Animorphs one after another and I'm seeing a pattern forming. There's nothing new. K. A Applegate is a great Author, but she's dwelling on the feelings so much. Back in the Trilogy with David that was fine, but we know now that they are having a hard time with the Yeerks. Give them a little hope in your books. Thery're almost depressing. The only reason I keep reading is because I'M hOPeing you'll get out of your rut."
3,"Okay, this plot is getting really REPETITIVE","Okay, this is one of KA's bad books. Number 30 was worse, and it's not hard to get much worse than this. Jake's having a hard time being a leader. In the book he talks about his Grandpa G, who has recently died, and how they're going to his funeral for 3-4 days. Tom, being a controller, protests.This book is about the risks Jake takes to protect his family--balancing his life while protecting his father. The book is kinda shaky--some parts are clear, understandable, and some are plain gibberish. But the book is okay."
1,Just Not For Me,I have read around 15 of Robyn Carr's books just in the last few months (just discovered her) and this is the ONLY ONE I just simply could not get 'into'. Finally gave up and skipped to the end to see what sense I could make of it.Must be just me since it has so many stars for its rating.
4,A amazing book,"This book is just simply amazing. Granted its' pace is a little slow at the beginning but the flow of the story is just perfect. Robyn Carr has perfectly described the friendship between four very different women, their relationship with their family and their struggle with life. This story is not about some fantasy-like characters. This story is about some realistic characters dealing with simple daily problems and how they learn to be true to themselves. It's a great book."
4,Finally someone wrote the book this industry needs!,"If you have ever wondered about how to go about starting an adult website but you just didn't know where and how to start - this book tells it all. I was lucky enough to get my hands on one of the very rare advance publication copies and I couldn't have been more pleased. The best thing I like about this book is the fact that it quickly dispels the ""get rich quick"" notions that a lot of new adult webmasters have. These guys tell it like it is. They don't keep going on and on about how rich you will be, instead, they show you how to build a business. I have been making a pretty good living putting up adult sites now for about two years. I wish I had this book then! If you are even thinking about starting an adult website - or just curious about how this business works do yourself a favor and read this book first. You definitely won't find any other book like it!"
4,Nice Mouse Pad,"This is your average sized mouse pad, not too big, but not too small. For me it's the perfect size. I bought the blue one, and was surprised to see how good the dark blue color looked along with my laptop. The thing I like the most about this mouse pad is the rubber surface it has on the bottom. It really grips onto the desk's surface and doesn't allow the pad to slip. This pad is not stiff, it is made out of a flexible material.I'm not sure about the antimicrobial characteristics it says it has, but still overall a good mouse pad."
4,Nice for the price,I've used this pad for a few months now and I definitely recommend it. It tracks my MX Revolution beautifully. My only gripe is that it is a bit thin.
1,bleh,"This is just a regular flimsy cloth mousepad, started unraveling at the edges the first day. It picks up dirt from your hands quickly and looks dirty after 2 weeks. Waste of money ;("
5,A balanced book,"This book is a 'must-read' for anyone who is interested in the Normandy invasion and *all* of the armies involved in it. In particular, if one has read any of Stephen Ambrose's execrable 'the Americans won the Second World War' books, this book shows how simply on the *Western* front, the contribution of the other armies fighting the Nazis have been systematically overlooked or even ridiculed by 'myth'-torians like Ambrose. This isn't a book that covers every incident of post-Overlord battles, but it gives one a look at many different tactics and weapons and the horror and glory that was the Second World War."
4,Some of the Routines that Made Cosby Great,This CD contains several of the Fat Albert routines that ilustrate the comic genius of Bill Cosby. They all revolve his youth in Philadelphia and the boys he grew up with. All men should have hilarious stories of their antics as youth to draw upon for hilarious memories. Cosby's genius is in his ability to make thos stories funny to others. He does a great job.Bill Cosby is unusual in this day and age for his ability to generate tremendous laughs without resorting to profanity. He makes the extra effort to do so and still be funny. The effort pays off.Get this recording but be prepared to laugh uproarisouly at the foibles of youth.
5,Not just for World War Two buffs,"I had read about It Happened Here for years before I had a chance to see it and assumed it was created by and for teenaged nerds who make detailed models of Tiger tanks and Stukas. However, what impressed me the most about this film was its adult, complex plot. I would not have expected two young film and military history geeks to choose as their main character a woman faced with making moral compromises to survive in a Nazi- occupied England. The fanatical devotion to period accuracy that Brownlow and Mollo display only serves to enhance the film's depiction of the brutality of life under the Nazis."
3,Cute but useless,Cute book. A little useless and wished I hadn't bought it because it's just another book to go on the shelf after the 3 minute read. I should have known but that Happy Bunny is just so darn funny I couldn't help myself.
2,Loved it--then it fell apart!,"This was a great little hub; I plugged it right into my computer (no extension cord) with a touchpad, camera, and external hard drive plugged in and had no issues to report. But this week the metal part that plugs into my computer started loosening from the hub then literally fell apart (metal plug pulled out and stuck in my computer's usb drive and one of the tines inside fell out). Had this hub about 11 months. Not pleased! Recommendation: if you do buy this hub, use an extension cord rather than plugging the hub right into your computer. That way if something breaks, it will just be a cord, not an expensive hub!"
2,great for kids,i am an adult woman and wanted a querky cheap watch that i could throw on and let it tell me time...that band is a little UGG and pukey bright...a little cheesy even for the cheap price...but hey not bad for a kid...they are always losing and breaking their stuff anyway right>?
5,Eydie sings Songs from the Silver Screen,"I don't know when Eydie recorded this collection of songs from the silver screen, but she still sounds just wonderful. Considering this lady is no spring chicken, more power to her!"
2,Terrible,"Where do I begin ?Icke has absolutely no idea what he's talking about in this book. He relentlessly mixes facts with fiction to create a rather disturbing cocktail of nonsense for the reader.Does anyone honestly believe that reptillian beings actually exist in any form other than subconscious manifestations of serpent archetypes ? The fact that NO ONE has actually witnessed a reptillian being publicly speaks volumes about Icke's delusional psyche.I get the feeling that Icke wrote this book to satisfy peoples curiosity and to feed them what they want to hear. This is Icke's MO as of the biggest secret - mix fact and fiction together to create fear and misdirection at the same time. All the while Icke pockets a princely sum for his overpriced ""books"" and phony ""lectures"".I'm certainly not going to give Icke one penny for this diseased garbage. He should be ashamed of himself for writing such mindless unsupported rubbish."
1,uh-huh,"The greatest analgesic, soporific, stimulant, tranquilizer, narcotic, and to some extent even antibiotic -- in short, the closest thing to a genuine panacea -- known to medical science is work. -Thomas SzaszGet a job you nutcases"
2,Appalling,"That's the best single word description of Children of the Matrix. This is the first (and probably) the last book by David Icke I'm likely to read (although I might pick up a stray one if I run across it, like watching a train wreck-I just can't help myself!.)The book is nonsense with a capital Non. It's a really bad back-story to an un-saleable series of science fiction novels right? If no than every hack writer out there has a future as a self publisher of pseudo-fictional drivel. Entire volumes could be written about many of the points Icke randomly brings up on each page. It's quite impossible to make any sense of this book other than the author is convinced the film ""They Live"" is a documentary and the TV series `V' was a reality show. Children of the Matrix is nothing more than paranoid sounding ramblings which are demonstrably untrue."
2,BEWARE! outstanding performance...but only when it works!,"For the price, this is an impressive DLP television that way outperforms others in its class in terms of picture quality. Only drawback, there is a known problem with this model that many consumers have reported with no picture, a blinking Power/Standby light and clicking sounds. Well, after LESS THAN A WEEK out of the box, it happened to me. Sony claims they have no knowledge of this problem, fortunately the repairs are under warranty, but after 1-year this scenario will be costly. I am considering returning the tv to ABT electronics if the repairs cannot be completed in-home on the service date."
2,Too late for this review,"Well, mine just bit the dust yesterday with the CLOD. I purchased Spring 2006 and mainly used to watch in bed for Leno & Letterman just before falling asleep. It worked flawlessly, but then I decided to getter a better video card for my computer and connect to this TV. It had been used 4-6 hours per day for the last 8 months and well... you all know the rest. I never had to replace the bulb and I am sad to learn the repair is so high, but now in 2011 televions are soooo cheap that I am better off buying a new one for less money. I also have a 73"" Mitsubishi purchased in 2006 that is having problems, and that one cost me $4500. Too bad TVs don't last as long as they used to. Bought a RCA 25"" TV in the 70s and it lasted 20 years, you're lucky if it lasts 1/3 that long today."
2,Not the best KOTC dvd package around,"Over the 4 fight discs there are a few of the fights which are the same for some reason!!There are a few good fights on here, but there are much better KOTC dvds around than this one."
5,Absolutely Adorable!!!,"Love it, Love it, Love it!!! This is my first pentacle as a Neophyte and Ive been searching for the perfect one for 3 years now. this is it, its the perfect size and as someone mentioned before the interlocking design only appears on the front which isnt a problem at all but I thought you guys should know..it was in perfect condition and came with the generic black string that most pendants of this type come with. the quality of the silver is top notch....don't hesitate to get this pentacle from this seller, its totally worth it"
2,Thin Holmesian Adventures in WWI,"Guess what? German spies seem to know of Allied offensives before they get underway. Mycroft leans on Watson to importune Holmes away from his behives, and investigate. Soon Holmes and Watson are entertaining at an Army base near Stonehenge, with Holmes on violin and Watson on piano(!). Spies are quickly uncovered, and Holmes and Watson take their places, passing over to France, where eventually, flying over areas well behind the battlefronts (contrary to the title) Watson's sharp eyes and Holmes' powers of ratiocination soon reveal a dastardly scheme to win the war on behalf of the Kaiser!Like many of Andrews' Holmesian pastiches, this is told in a leisurely fashion, with virtually no action. In fact there are quite a few signs Andrews is tiring of the whole pastiche business, including Holmes mocking himself not once but several times.If you've read previous books from this author and publisher, you'll know pretty much what to expect."
3,Sad But True:,"I have Been A Chris Conner fan since 1953 and have always found her to be one of the very best, always true to her self and her style.although she is still great her voice just sounds tired,more so on ""As Time Goes By"".still a good listen,and a good addition to anyone's collection,so buy it and enjoy."
3,Good Product,These pouches are simple to use with the Fellowes Saturn SL 125 Home & Office Laminator. Super quick shipping. The price was affordable also.
5,Color photos make it so clear,"I have read several books, and while the words may be informative, there is noting like the pictures. This book was great for me because the pictures were sharp and clear, which allowed me to see the difference a few adjustments in my approach could make, without having to read the entire book. Honestly, I flipped through this book and found photos of what my shots looked like, and next to them was a photo of what they could look like.This book -- though its title suggests it is for experts only -- is great for anyone who wants to become a better photographer in a hurry. And, when you have time, there are also great explanations in the text."
4,Great Title - If You Get It a Chance...,"This title is good for all photographers because I doubt if any of them would say they could not use suggestions. All of us can and all of us can benefit from this title from O'Reilly and Milburn. I have the second edition and I can imagine what the welcome the first one got.What essential equipment do you need? Want? Like? Milburn covers it all and the sequence that he provides is one that should be welcome by everyone who picks up a camera.As far as Milburn, he is a digital genius and a photographer who has proven himself with his work. He is also a prominent author having written hundreds of articles and best selling book. This is an example of a best selling book. Pick it up..."
4,Pleased with my Power Wheel II,"I love my power wheel...definitely kicks up my workouts! The only problem I've found is when I use it with some of my clients who have longer feet than I do, their toes drag the ground...making it impossible to use. But I do like the Power Wheel, and would definitely recommend it!"
1,Again with cheap parts (see Jungle Gym),"I purchased this item along with the jungle gym. (see review) This product, like the jungle gym is made of cheap parts. It is also a victim of poor engineering. The wheel is too large and the stretch bands are not attached properly to hold a normal size foot. If your foot is long enough to make use of the stretch bands, it would be too wide for the foot rest anyway. An ab wheel with foot holders is a decent concept but this one is poorly constructed. I am glad I did not gift it before seeing in for myself. I get the feeling that lifeline is trying to capture as many sales as possible before the word gets out.I am completely dissatisfied with Lifeline USA and will never purchase another of their products again."
1,CAN'T DO LOWER BODY EXERCISES.,"I have wide feet. The Velcro straps will not go around the ball of my feet when I have shoes on. The rubber straps will not stay on my Achilles tendon when I have my shoes off. What are you going to do about this??? Also, instructional DVD has no video."
5,Great Workout,"This thing is great. It's improved my balance and core strength. It's very sturdy, excellent quality. Punishing workout but it's completely worth it."
5,Best socks,These are the best socks I have ever owned (except for maybe some wool socks I got a lot time ago in Germany). They are slightly padded at the heel and ball of the foot. Extremely comfortable.
4,Great for hiding things,"I bought this for a recent European trip. I wore it around the house for a few days before departure, to get used to it. It can be a bit hot underneath while wearing it, but most of the time I didn't notice it was there. I carried passport and spare Euros that I didn't need to have ready access to (you don't want to be pulling it in and out of your shirt in stores, etc.). I will use this product again and again. Highly recommended!"
2,Inferior Release Print,"It's been through the projector's film gate too many times.Film scratches, extreme contrast and low resolutionmake this Elke Sommer classic difficult to watch."
2,meh,"I'm probably one of very, very few people who liked Carmageddon 3 better than the second one. The controls are poor. More often than not, the enemies would fight me a bit, then run away somewhere, usually getting trapped in some tight corridor where I couldn't get enough speed to destroy them, or the godawful water. I must've spent a third of my time trying to work underwater. Sure, it gives you an underwater ability powerup, but it doesn't help very much.I guess killing peds is fun, but it gets old pretty fast. So does ramming your car into your oppenents over and over only to have nothing happen. No damage. No credits. No time bonus. Nothing. Even once I had built up a lot of armor, power, and offensive, I still had a problem with it.There's a lot of flipping over in this game. A lot. Way too much. I got stuck upside down or on my side even from just hitting a slight bump. The enemies got flipped over a lot too. Not very fun.The game was alright at first, but it got old really fast."
1,"Don't Waste Your Money, honey","I got burned on the hype. I was so disappointed. There's nothing fresh, nothing we don't already know (and yes I'm southern to the bone.) It's a sanitized ""guidebook"" to southern womanhood and any southern woman could have written it with one hand tied behind her. You'll find more ""how to"" tips in ""Good Housekeeping"" or ""McCalls"". It's not even well written! I wish I'd been warned. I want my money back."
2,Southern women are better than this,"If you believe Ms Rich, then what Southern women ""know"" is that men are easily manipulated, shallow, ego-maniacs, who only value women in as much as how good they make them (men) feel about themselves.We all appreciate thoughtful, kind, positive people and I have met plenty of Southern women and men who fit that description. For the most part I think their charm was sincere. I certainly hope their consideration was not simply a means of getting something they wanted from me.This is really cynical stuff wrapped in ""spun sugar"" as Ms. Rich would say. I'm not interested in getting what I want if it forces me to live in the affected, inauthentic way Ms. Rich advocates here."
1,You must be kidding!,"I found this book to be 75% disgusting. I wish I hadn't purchased it. Yes, it's fine to be considerate of others, polite, caring, and certainly SINCERE, but all of the tips for coy ""little ole me"" behavior in order to get one's way seem a bit designing and very dated. I showed parts of it to my husband, and he had a good laugh over it.The part that really turned me off was when the author described being in a plastic surgeon's office, turning on the magnolia routine (flirting), in order to get an appointment for some beautifying procedure while he was tending to a car accident victim. If I had done that, I don't think I would admit it.This book went into the recycling bin. It's not something I would care to pass on to anyone I know."
1,RinTinTin,"I was disappointed in this dvd. The picture and sound quality was terrible. I was really looking forward to going back to my youth with this program. Sorry, but did not fit the bill."
4,Interesting read........,"This is the first book I ever read that took me into the life of a mafioso's son. For this alone, it made it interesting. The author explains how he felt growing up, describes his family life, friends, school, girls. He explains how on the outside he appeared to be a regular kid showing up for school, going on dates, hanging with friends. But on the inside his father was slowly teaching him the ropes of the ""business."" I think the son was the only person the father could truly confide in. The son describes his father as a loving family man but found out years later that he was a cold blooded hit man for the mafia. Good book. I would recommend this book.I am now reading ""Murder Machine"" by Jerry Capeci which is based on the father's killing sprees."
5,growing up bad,like my uncle jerry pappa papper bear said you just never know who is behind that face frend or not when its time its time louie bagels
3,Interesting but...,"I am an inner city high school English teacher who is always looking for a book that will appeal to my reluctant readers. Although I enjoyed the memior, I felt it was far from extraordinary. I sympathized with his inner struggle but was not captivated.I was also slightly erked by the multiple quotations opening each chapter. I saw them as a means for the author to make himself seem exceptionaly literate."
2,Poor,Getting a book published merely because your daddy was a gangster is a bit of crime. Me buying it and toiling through the amateurish prose even more of a crime.
5,Captivating,"Definitely Captivating. If you liked LOST, you'll probably like this, as it keeps you at the edge of your seat wanting to know what's going to happen next, and what's going on!"
2,pilot had a promise and the second episode did not deliver...,"I liked the pilot so much and was waiting for the second episode and it looks like ""the steam went out "" of the productionThe plot becomes too stretched, those sleep walkings to the cemented door, and other things just don't live up to the first episode. I will give it a chance just for the beauty of the building but really it has to either pick up or I am out :)"
2,Not even Vanessa Williams can even save a show like this...,"Well Anyway, This sucks. ""666"" is all about Terry O'Quinn. You might have remember him as Archenemy John Locke on TV's ""LOST"". Here on ""666"", He plays Gavin Doran, The Co-Owner of The Drake, The Historic Apartment Building with his wife, Olivia-Played by Vanessa. Gavin happens to be the boss to Henry and Jane Van Veen-Played by Dave Annable & Rachel Taylor. The Van Veens are the co-managers of The Historic Drake.Now, There are two aspects on this show; 1. This show is on a Sunday, a day that we all have to worship Both God & Jesus. ""666"" Needs to be moved to Friday Nights. and 2, The show's title has something to do with Devil-worshiping & Satanism. I am a devout christian, and I personally know my rights what to watch on TV."
2,Just don't pay for it,"The writing is awful. The characterizations are shallow. He didn't do a bad job capturing the tenor of a major forest firefighting base during a big hot summer (it made me homesick for Missoula). If you don't care about key characters popping up near the end of the book, others vanishing (whatever happened to the owner's wife?), and cartoon-depth, I suppose it's not bad for a summer read; I just hope y'all didn't pay the cover price."
4,Mainly concerned with nostra aetate report,I enjoyed the information provided and learned the much more work still to be done. I give it a five stars.
3,Meh.,"It's a lovely product really. It's very gentle on my eyes, and removed most products quite well without being overly harsh on my skin. However, it does absolutely nothing to remove high pigment colors, liners, or mascaras. It's even worse on anything waterproof. If it actually worked on every product in my case, I'd love it. But alas, it didn't work for some products."
3,Unstructured and inaccurate but still useful,"We bought this book because now we live in the area and wanted to see what's out there. This book provides pretty good idea and listing and has all essential details but its also outdated and unstructured when compared to books like60 Hikes within 60 Miles: Seattle: Including Bellevue, Everett, and Tacoma (60 Hikes - Menasha Ridge).The trail maps are very basic (and sometime misleading because of lack of details) and the directions to get to trail head are sometime just not enough. The book doesn't have GPS coordinates but fortunately the authors have created waypoints in Google Maps (http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl;=en&msa;=0&msid;=104533212117189621673.00044d8c694b6da7eb931&z;=10)."
2,False information,I'm only posting this review to warn you that this is not a USB keyboard despite what it is labeled. DO NOT BUY if you need a USB keyboard.
4,nice keyboard and mouse,nice keyboard & mouse for the the price.the fact that's it's wireless just top's it off.easy set up no conflict with windows.
5,best mouse ever!!!,the mouse and the keyboard are great the keyboard is a little stiff but it is starting to were in
2,Not Wireless,"This is NOT a wireless keyboard and i'll explain why at present i'm sitting in my lazy boy chair writing on the keyboard, ah you say then it must be wireless..... well no cause the receiver needs to be on the coffee table next to me and not only that it needs to be in line of sight, if even a milk glass or coffee cup is between the keyboard and the receiver i'll get dropped letters when im typing.But it does have one pro that is it's battery usage 2 AA batteries and they last for over 6 months also it's a pretty comfy keyboard to write on slightly curved with a nice wrist rest.Also as a mac user it's pretty nice that the play buttons and the volume buttons funtion without installing any drivers if you want to use the other function keys you need to install MS drivers.Pros:Good battery lifedurablenice wrist restdecent function keysCons:NOT wireless for more the 30 centimeters from the receiver so get a usb extension cord if you plan to use it in the living room."
4,MS Optical keyboard/ mouse,"Very good. I like the size, weight, and key placement. The extra keys are easily programable to my specific tasks. Price was significanly better than local retail. Seller was prompt."
2,Gamers Beware!,"I love this keyboard. It's comfy, well designed and the extra keys are useful and well integrated. HOWEVER, if you play any games on your PC (real games, not minesweeper or hearts), do not get this! There is a flaw in these wireless MS keyboards which means that keys get ""stuck"" when playing. This makes first person games like Doom 3 or Half-Life 2 virtually unplayable. If you don't believe me, check out the message boards on Microsoft's website!Another problem most likely to affect gamers: powerful subwoofers WILL interfere with the mouse on occasion, meaning that this is again not the keyboard/mouse set for gamers.If all you are going to use this set for is email and basic office applications, it is a great purchase. However, do not buy this if you play games!"
3,Review after ST. LUCIA vacation,"Disappointing picture quality. Grainy, dull colors compared to my previous Minolta camera that I have had for several years but is starting to break down (my fault). Not worth the money. Close ups were clearer. Not good with distant, scenic shots."
2,It's a clip show.,"I thought these were dead. Why not just have one less episode? This is irritating, especially when one has actually paid for the episode."
5,Stargate greatness,This series is awesome. It's like the next chapter if the original stargate sg-1 series. I only wish it hasn't been canceled due to pricing. Apparently it was too expensive to film each episode.
5,purchase all seasons,"What can I say; the most fun you can have with the magic of Science Fiction. Make sure you purchase the full DVD box set of Stargate SG1 first. Watching SG1 first will set you up for the storyline flow into Stargate Atlantis. I've owned both for quite sometime now, and always go back to get entertained with such great acting and story. This is as close you can get to the actual possibility of the US Military involvement with extraterrestrials."
2,Great concept but disturbing ending,"I liked the plot. The entity being Dr. Weir was unexpected, but from knowing her character too many things that she did were very uncharacteristic of her. She put Atlantis and her people in danger several times, lied about the others knowing that she was going to Atlantis, and never lie to people, replicators or not and essentially commit genocide. I really disliked the ending. Both Dr. Weir and the members of the Atlantis crew would not feel comfortable killing a small group of replicators that were being peaceful, just because one went rogue and tried to escape. I call that genocide. Especially tricking them into walking through the stargate to their deaths while they think they are getting a chance to continue their research. I think the writer seriously should have realized that it was out of character and in bad taste."
5,If Something Unforgivable Has Happened to You,This book was awesome....understandable...easy read...no convoluted psychological jargon...reasons for why we need to forgive....and suggestions for support groups at the end....If something you think is unforgivable has happened to you....this is a must read...takes a load of weight off your shoulders...
2,Eagle creek comfort lumbar pillow,"I purchased this product to use on long airplane flights. I would give this product five stars for preventing low back pain. However, it began to slowly deflate within days of starting to use it. I don't know whether it was my bad luck that I purchased a defective item, or whether this product has a quality control problem."
1,Product delivered might actually be new style called Back Buddy -- see those reviews,"This seller was nice and gave me a refund, but please know that as of about May 20, 2012, when I ordered this product, the Going in Style company sent a newer version that is/was not the pictured item. The new replacement item by Eagle Creek is called the Back Buddy. It is a terrible product. Please see the reviews for that product here on Amazon. It is terrible at holding air, and when it did for short periods, was not nearly as good a back support as the previous version (which by the way, had a somewhat different shape). Thanks...."
1,cheapy cheapy cheapy,This was so disappointing...not worth any money...it's flimsy and see through and ours didn't even have a hat come with it...will be returning this item.
1,Does not fit Suncast GS9000 Extra large shed,I wish the product description noted that it only works with certain Suncast sheds. It does not work with my shed #GS9000. Now I have to pay to return the product; not happy about this
3,switches are iffy,"I bought mine used about 10 years ago for $50, and it's easily the best $50 I ever spent, but the right footswitch (not expression pedal) quickly went out. I've opened it up and looked at it and all the relevant connections seem solid, but it still doesn't work. Just be aware that you might have one or both footswitches go out if you're not lucky."
4,Functional and lightweight,"The only reason I gave it 4 and not 5 stars was that it is a little flimsy. We have to push in the front of it in order for the lid to close completely. I would still buy it again if I had to do it again.This is our second box like this. The first one has not faded, which makes me happy."
1,Box has some serious design flaws,"Pros.- Box is big enough to fit my cushions, pillows, and miscellaneous items- Easy to build and put together. Just make sure to follow directions and ensure all your pieces are positioned correctly before pressing them together.Cons.- lid leaves quarter inch gaps at both front corners (left and right). Apparently, lid clamps from two points positioned closest to the center, and leave the corners unsecured (Not Good). As mentioned by other owners, there is no way to secure a padlock on the box. One of the panels has a hole for a lock, but the lid does not... Based on previous reports, I knew this prior to making my purchase and was not a deal breaker for me.Notes:I sent photographs to the manufacturer as requested; however, the ""Warranty Team"" has yet to respond. In the end, I am returning the box.VERY DISAPPOINTED is an understatement."
3,Not so water proof,"I don't know if I just received a defective product, but the lid doesn't quite line up with the box. It's just a little off center. This causes some, not a lot, of rain water to get through. I'm going to have to figure out a way to keep the inside dry somehow. Other than that important feature, it was pretty easy to put together. Everything snaps into place. Like another reviewer stated, you do need to have the box a little off the wall in order to open the lid."
4,An eye opener,"This book is extensively researched and full of information. I found sometimes too much information. But as my introduction to conspiracy theories, what an eye opener! It has changed how I see the News or anything political forever. I found myself getting angry at how people are manioulated through the media and mass unconscious which are the biggest mind control elements. Time to unplug from the Matrix!"
1,how stupid can u be,"another trip into fantasy land with the flaky Mr Icke. You remember , in his last book Icke told us that the Bushs, the British Royal Family etc were all part of some alien lizard race, that ruled the world and that Queen Elizabeth bathed in infant blood to stay beautiful. This book is more of the same. If you research any of the ""facts"" Icke bases his delusions on, you will find them to be falacious. I know that to be true, in the limited area, that I am familiar with. Why was this book published??? Save your money.How can any sane person believe this stuff??"
3,2 star deduction for price,"All in all its a really good keyboard. But Staples sells one exactly like it only its made by microsoft for half the price. They were out and I had to have another ergonomic keyboard. Couldn't go without one. So while it really helps me out and so far I haven't had any problems, there just isn't 40 dollars worth of keyboard here. Not when you can get the exact same thing for half the price. Sorry Fellowes/Microban, but you're going to have to do better than that."
5,Great for advanced exercisers,"I'm a personal trainer and I was able to modify and apply these workouts to almost every level of client. Creative, challenging, and fun!"
1,ridiculous tape,Only someone with absoloutely no concept of what Muay Thai is would even consider buying this. Read the other reviews and note which ones seem generic and which seem relevant. Don't waste your money...
5,12 Extra Pages,I have a copy of this book but there is a binding error.Pages 109 to 132 are repeated. Are there any other books like this or is this possibly the only one?How does this affect the value?
4,A great way to explore PHP without picking up a book,The presentations are slow in some spots but the contents make this DVD an important tool for those considering using PHP for web developmemt. I found the CD they included useful.
2,not so hot,"i agree that the writing is good, but this novel is not that interesting and is certainly not compelling. maybe i have outgrown this ""anita brookner""-type of novel?"
2,Lost count of how many extra packs I bought...,"Thought that this would be a miracle worker for taking the vibrations from my car away. After several applications, (One over another) I realized, the vibrations just are not going away. Pretty disapointing for the money spent.............."
4,"A ""must have"" in all judoka libraries","Very well written, and excellent training guide. Many of the pictures are very old and hard to see clearly, but still relevant.Nice coverage of all subject matter from training, competition, and kata."
5,THE only book you need to buy,"Don't spend all your money on judo books, you only need this one. It is written by the master himself(Kano) and is easy reading and easy to understand. I think its worth twice the price!"
2,The minority voice...of reason,"How tedious I thought this book was, and I usually like Mary Balogh's Signet Regencies. The heroine should have been slapped for her silliness in running off in the first place. Everything that other reviewers found ""enchanting"" and ""funny"", just escaped me -- I found it all silly and drawn out to the nth degree. I much, much prefer Mary B. in her serious vein, such as ""The Temporary Wife"", than this drivel."
1,Don't kid yourself,"This book is awful. The entire book, or at least the significant portions, could be published on one side of a cocktail napkin. Pitino wrote this book to make fat stacks. If you want real motivation and inspiration, look any place else and avoid this two hundred page ego stroke."
2,Ten Steps To Overachieving In Business,"Rick Pitino's book on how to overachieve in the business world is nothing that anybody with any common sense hasn't heard before. The book was written because Pitino is trying to tell his story of his basketball career. He will make a germane point with the first paragraph at the beginning of the chapter, and then will belabor the simple point into 20 pages. This is a good book to read, buy you don't need to read the whole thing, you need to read the first few points of the chapter, where Pitino makes his point, and the summary of the main points at the end of the chapter, and you will learn just as much as somebody who read the whole book. It is a decent piece of literature, but combined with a biography of Pitino's career makes the entire work way to redundant."
1,This toy is a danger.,My dog was able to destroy this in 3 minute. She was able to chew it to pieces in that time. I am glad that I was sitting there watching. She could have choked on some of the many pieces had not taken from her. The company that made this toy should be sued for endangering peoples pets.
2,Poor Warranty Service,"Bought this set new in December 2005. Beautiful picture until October 2006.....then a band of ""railroad tracks appeared. Sony's warranty service provider in Miami, A&K; Electronics, picked up the set to repair it on October 13, 2006.As of November 11, 2006, I've been told that ""the parts are on order"", ""they sent the wrong part"", ""they sent the part but it needs another part"", and there is never anyone readily available who can give a straight answer when you call! Sony Customer Service only echo's what the service provider says when you ask them for help.Maybe, I need to write this $2000 blunder off and go buy a Samsung.....NEVER ANOTHER SONY PRODUCT FOR ME!"
2,Would be great ... if it worked!,"I recently moved to a new city, and I thought a GPS would help me find my way around, so I bought this package to add on to my Palm V. It would be great, except that I can't seem to get it to work about half the time. Often it can't find the GPS signal, and causes my entire Palm to reset itself. At first it worked much better, but for the last two months, I have not been able to make it work at all. I'm quite disappointed with its quality, but otherwise, I think the size and functions it provides are right on."
1,Not Enough Memory,"This is the best idea I have ever heard of. Too bad there's not enough memory on my Palm to hold maps. The program takes up a large portion of the memory in the Palm 5, then leaves no memory to store the Maps. The longest route I can store is aproximately a 20 minute trip using the point to point directions. I would suggest waiting until the next best thing comes out."
1,Poor design,The maps are clunky and get too big for the palm when exporting sufficient detail. The cigarette adaptor doesn't charge the Palm V. Navigation on the Palm is impractical while driving. A very bad product ! I am selling mine on ebay for $50.
2,Too Slooooow,"I had every problem mentioned in the other reviews but I wanted to add that the Palm V seems too slow to handle this unit. It is particularly slow when zooming in and out of maps. I have a DVD based nav system installed in my car which I love so I may have too high standards for this handheld unit. I believe the problem is mostly software based however. Basically, this products is not ready for prime time. BTW today is Oct. 2002. I tried this system out in 2000 so I don't know if there have been any improvements"
3,Fun - but difficult,Game arrived in good time - and in good condition. It is much fun to play - but difficult to progress in the levels. That is part of the fun as well - to keep playing and trying.
3,Diner Dash 2...Just ok.,"Since it took a few months for me to 'master' the orginal Diner Dash, I was hoping this one would be as/more challeging, but it wasn't. Although the new characters are cute...annoying cell-phone addicts, impatient joggers, families with crying babies, bookworms....the game itself wasn't anymore interesting to me than the original. I was a bit disappointed it took only 2 days to master this one."
2,doesn't live up to it's promise,"I thought it would do the trick, but it didn't last one evening. My 8 month german shepherd tore it right open. It looks tough."
5,Perfect for me,My son found this book and I had to get my own copy. We have been making wine for a few years but we were making mistakes and pouring it down the drain. Now we know why!
1,Too many repairs and very costly even under parts warrenty.,"Like another reviewer, we have had resistance problems that require repair. Unlike most repairs, you must pay for their service ($139.00) at least 3-5 days before anyone even calls let alone shows up. Then you must pay another $55.00 if they have to come back to replace a part. We have own this machine less than 5 years and it has already required two repairs. The maintaince on this machine is quite costly."
1,CRAP,this guy just threw this piece togeather still found it useful for arse wipe and starting a camp fire at my church social
5,CluckCoo Clock,Love This Clock !!! Fun clock to have...Friends get a kick out of it...Only coo coo's when the lights are on. Exceptional Quality.
5,Does what it is designed for!,"These pans were of a good price and quality. They fit perfectly in my GE electric range. They also came very quickly in the mail, less than 48 hours. Great!"
5,Works even on older models!,"Just as awesome as others have described. I live in an apartment and didn't have many options thanks to poor management. Fits my old, yellowing GE stove great!"
2,Not really chrome,"This item was billed as being chrome. It is not. It's basically stainless steel type metal, not a shiney chrome that you can see yourself in. If it was chrome, it would have a non-porous surface, this does not. Save your money! You can buy the same product at Wal-mart for less. It will stain easily. Real chrome might too bur would be easier to clean due to the smoother surface. Not recommended!"
2,Large ones didn't fit,"Pretty simple, the large ones didn't fit my stove. Small ones are nice. The large ones seemed slightly too large to fit into the stove"
5,The children loved it.,I read it to 5 classes and the children loved it at a private christian school. The children lived the video clips
3,mixed review,"I found this book to be a little long, and maybe I'm paranoid, but it seems wierd that this little girl goes into this guys shop and helps him out. In the book, I know it's fine, but I don't necessarily want my little daughter to think it's okay to approach strange men who have candy. Maybe I'm reading too much into this. I do love the story behind the candy cane, whether it's true or not. I like focusing on Jesus at Christmas."
4,Good Traditional Book,"Every year I buy a new Christmas book to read and we alternate on Christmas Eve reading the new one and some of the previous ones. I like this book, it is a good traditional story. Good for all ages."
1,YIKES! CREEPY!!,"I had always grown up hearing about the legend of the candy cane and was excited to find a book detailing the legend. My four boys and I settled in to read, at first I was pleased with the artwork, very nice, but as the story went on I spent more time talking to my boys about STRANGER DANGER then about the actual legend of the Candy Cane! I don't care what time frame this book is set in, it is totally inappropriate to have a small girl ""hanging out"" with a middle aged man that NO ONE in the town knows!! People are kidding themselves if they think there weren't perverts ""back then"" too!!! If my son hadn't thrown away the book jacket we would be sending this one back. Guess it will go to Good Will. Look for another book if you are trying to teach your kiddos about the Legend of the Candy Cane."
1,Fallene Total Block UVA/UVB Tinted 60,"I have researched and tried every sunscreen imaginable. This does not have a sufficient zinc oxide content of 5% or more. In addition, I wish I could return it but I opened it. It is like spreading mud on your face. It's extremely opaque, thicker and more opaque than the heaviest foundation you could use. It doesn't spread and balls up. It's masque-like. I can work with all types of sunscreens but this one is unbelievably dry. I tried to see if there was a date stamped on it because I thought it had to be an old batch or something. No date. I will never buy it again. If there is a good review, be sure to see if there are any tips to applying it."
5,Ssssssswwwwwwwweeeeeeeettttttttt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have loved this game scence I first layed eyes on the arcade version, and when it finally came out on Dreamcast, I just had to get it. The graphics are actually pretty sweet for a platform game. You have to gat this game.......it is the best."
5,Greatest 2D Fighter Ever,"This game is simply awesome. The best fantasy fighter ever!!Do yourself a favor and pick this game up, you will not regret it. This game and Capcom vs SNK are the reason why I bought a Dreamcast."
5,dream come true.,All i can say is this game is a dream come true the graphics are great the tag team element of the game is great.And last but not least there are a ton of characters to play as although you have to unlock a lot of those characters to play as them.What can i say the gameplay is really good there is no one that i know who does not like this game.Anybody who likes fast paced fighting action this is most definitley your game.
2,Disappointing.,"As a fan of both the New Avengers and Spider-man, I figured a Spider-Man story featuring the New Avengers would be great. It wasn't. It seems like the makers couldn't decide whether to cater to the New Avengers readers or the Spider-Man readers, so they opted for neither. The art and story feel like an old episode of the 80s Spider-Man cartoon, hokey. Quite a step backwards since the New Avengers series and Spider-Man is usually engaging entertainment. Skip this one."
4,Off to another vivid and entertaining adventure!,"This tale was wonderfully funny,nail biting and full of old friends, rich characters who have become family, and it was lovely to be reunited with them!Alas, I did not like the heroine very much. She was rather stupid. I dislike stupidity in my lead female characters. She took chances with her safety that just didn't make sense, unless one was seriously deficient in the brain box. But Lynn Kurland makes me happy and takes me away...important attributes in today's world. She must never stop writing!!!!"
5,Dreams of Stardust,This is another great book about the de Piaget family. This time it is a daughter. Amanda is probably everything a medievel woman should not be. Jake is everything a modern man should be. And the two together are magic. And what Jake goes through to win Amamda! Great read.
5,dreams of stardust,"Lynn Kurland has created some of the best time travel stories I ever read. Having read her books out of order it nice to see all of my favorite characters from One Enchanted Evening again in this tale of Jake a man who instead of taking from his dad's estate went out and made his own fortune as a gem cutter and jeweler. When he travels further back than Pippa did in her tale he meets Amanda of Arcane who has turn down every would be suitor to come fourth. This bit makes me think of the story of Disney's version of Aladdin and how princess Jasmine didn't wanted to handed over to just any man like cattle. She finds herself surprise to fall for a merchant without a title, whose better skilled fighting with his hands than a sword, and can challenge her in a game of chess. To win her hand Jake must get pass Amanda's family members and prove himself worthy to the get before she decides to live as a nun."
3,A nice story,"Yes, there could have been more intereaction between Jake and Amanda. Yes, more romance would have improved the book. But I enjoyed the interaction between Jake and Amanda's brothers. Overall, I enjoyed the book and think that most Kurland fans will too."
4,More of a story of determination than romance...,"I won't re-tell the story, as so many other reviewers have already taken care of that. It's true that the romance between Jake and Amanda isn't as well developed as most of Lynn Kurland's stories. They don't spend all that much time together... they fall in love more with the character traits that they observe from a distance.That said, it's still a wonderful, well-written book that tells the story of Jake's finding a family in the 13th century. He really becomes a part of the de Piaget family. This book is much better as part of the family series, than it is a stand-alone book. Read it... but read Another Chance To Dream and If I Had You first."
5,Ren is the shizzy,I never got to see if he ever found all 13 of the treasures but maybe some day but anyway this definitely needs to come out on DVD along with alot of the 80s shows. 80s shows are the best.
1,"If purchasing for irons or putters, look elsewhere","Book is more focused on tickets, programs and autographs. It is absolutely worthless for identifying and finding values for irons and putters. It lumps generations of irons into a single category, even if the iron was completely redone and just kept the same name."
5,Fascinating video with mind-boggling information,This video shatters the Political Correctness myths about who was where first. This video has information that is censored from the West and even China is in on the censorship act. It's amazing that this video even was made! Get it before it goes down the memory hole.
4,NICE SHOWER STALL LINERS.,THE HEAVY DUTY SHOWER STALL LINER I BOUGHT I VERY NICE. I WILL KEEP BUYING THIS KIND.
2,Berlin and Eastern Germany,"This book is out-of-date. When I used it I found that many things had changed, even a museum had been moved to another building, a recommended beer had gone out of business, following directions, streets now have ""do-not-enter"" signs on them. I like Blue Guide a lot, and the book is still good for the inside of churches and museums that have not changed. But overall, I would not buy this book until they come out with an updated version. East Germany is changing fast and you need the most current information available."
4,"Good for only so long, then it gets repetitive.","When I first turned on the game, my initial thought was ""Wow, what great graphics"". Then came the slowdown. I was able to overlook that easily, as it's not that bad. As I got more into the game, the puzzles got harder, and the characters were getting cutsier and cutsier, of course. But also, it was all the same thing. Find the mole, learn moves, collect stuff, fight a boss, turn into something, get jiggys, etc. It gets pretty monotonous after a while, and it all feels the same. If you are into and collecting items and saving cute little critters and everything, this is your game."
5,Flawless...,"This game is the perfect mix between Banjo Kazooie and Donkey Kong. B-K needed more mini games, this game has plenty. Donkey Kong went overboard with collectibles, and cross level action. This perfect mix has reduced collectibles, therefore causing less tediousness. The original game's (B-K) graphics were spectacular, but too dark. The gloomyness was depressing. B-T has bright, and improved graphics. B-T has many minigames that are replayable without setting foot inside the game's world. Many of the minigames are multiplayer. This adds great replay value to the games. Each level is filled with ingenious surprises that add wonderful satisfaction. The play control is wonderful Banjo, Kazooie, Mumbo, and all of their transformations move naturally."
1,not funny enough,"Some of the jokes were ok, but most were vulgar, rotten, mean, with no point whatsoever. In this book, Jim mentions/suggests asylums, dying, and violence. Although this is all right for teens, it's not really too funny, and definetely NOT FOR KIDS."
4,Looks like the photo...,"...but the longer legs don't stay firm - get wobbly. I think it is beautiful and I love the quiet sound, but my two year-old grandson is afraid of it, though he loves ""hoppers"" as he calls them. So, unfortunately, he stays away from it altogether. He doesn't mind the rubber ""soundless"" grasshoppers. Hopefully he will grow to like it when he still like grasshoppers."
3,Good introduction but not a practice tape,"This is an excellent tape if you want an overall introduction to Yoga. She demonstrates and explains the moves clearly. However, I found it frustrating that there were no short routines so you could follow along every day...just a long description of moves. If you are an abosolute beginner, this tape is worth watching once or twice but check out the other tapes (AM/PM, etc.) for your day to day routines."
2,Not a very good beginners video.,"A dis-appointment. A video too long with so much ads and filler. Patricia Walden tries so hard to prove the beauty of yoga, that she fails miserably. An good example of which is a scene before the practice in which she practices yoga (a tad poor IMO), in front of a sand dune. Another sad dis-appointment is the exclusion of the sun salutations. Every beginner should know these basic stretches."
2,A Little Too Beginner,"I rented this video from Blockbuster as my introduction to yoga videos (I had taken classes but they are pretty steep in price.) I am glad I did not buy it, because after about the 4th viewing I was ready to say goodbye to Patricia! I found the poses unchallenging, and to be honest, her voice is a tad annoying. I feel Denise Austin's Yoga Essentials is better for the beginning yoga practitioner, but one who hasn't been bedridden for months."
2,Too slow - may work for beginners,"I thought that this video was very slow moving. I think it is an extremely beginner video that can only be watched a few times, but after that it gets extremely irritating because you sit and wait for too long in between each pose. I think there are many other beginner yoga videos that would be much more suitable."
2,What Up With the Ending?,Great book - until the ending. WTF? Did Perry have a deadline to make? It was so abrupt... not his best work. Very disappointing.
5,After almost 2 years of use it's still a great camera,"I bought this camera for my wife as a gift 2 Christmas's ago. She loves it. It's small enough to fit easily in her purse or in a fanny pack and yet it gives you enough control with the zoom lens and flash options to have some creative control. And I must admit, when we go backpacking I'd much rather carry this small, light camera than my Nikon.It's turned out to be a great little camera. We're very happy with it."
5,BEST New Orleans Cajun Recipes,My brother has lived in New Orleans for just under ten years and turned me onto this book. I have tried at least 5 recipes in the past year. My personal favorite is the Jambalaya recipe on page 76. I added more tabasco sauce and substituted chicken for the ham. The key to a a great Jambalaya is a well seasoned pot. I bought a Cast Iron Dutch Oven and only use it for my Cajun Dishes. Buy this book and Enjoy the Cajun Cooking Experience.
5,Using Kensington BT,"I've used the kensington for awhile now, I like it, somewhat easier for me than my previous d-link. I would recommend it to anyone."
4,Healthy travel,Excellent and essential reading for anyone going to the African continent.Currently being used by several participants in the Plymouth to Banjul run.
4,I received the book in a timely fashion and the book was in decent condition!,"Great experience, they sent me the book within a few days, it arrived in great condition and was EXACTLY what I purchase. The book was an older (1970's) publication so the book itself shown some aging, the pages were discolored around the edges but overall was in great condition for a book that was over thirty years old. I would order from them again! I thought I wouldn't be able to find it, so thanks so much for the item!Thanks! MP"
2,Underpowered and Muddy,"I loved the form factor and the appearance, but was unpleased with the murky quality to the sound. We attempted to adjust the output to no avail with CDs, radio, and iPOD inputs. We'll be trying again, but not with Teac."
1,Rule 1500 Automatic Bilge Pump unreliable,"After about a year installed, sometimes it will let the bilge fill with water without turning on, sometimes it runs continuously in a dry bilge until power is removed. Not ready for prime time."
4,Play is great. Cover differs from one shown,"I had seen the play in NY and wanted a copy- particularly liked the cover design, and was looking forward to having that as well as the play. The writing does not disappoint. The cover design was NOT as pictured and did disappoint. Would be wary of ordering from this seller again"
3,Coby MP-C886,Came with dead battery. Took a bit to figure out how to get music loaded. After that it worked fine.
4,Our Second One,"We bought this model new 2 years ago at $99 and it has been a good performer for making protein shakes with crushed ice from the frig. Appears to be a true bargain at this price, so we bought another one for another area of the house. Time will tell!"
4,good for the money,"I wish the thing could actually crush ice, as some blenders can, but it is well made and does the trick for the vast majority of blender jobs. Nice-looking, certainly, and easy to pop parts in dishwasher/put back together."
3,Another casualty of poor design,"I use this blender to make smoothies and chop ice and can live with the idiosyncrasies. What I find infuriating is when I go to make mayonnaise or another emulsion which requires slowly pouring the oil in through the hole in the lid while the blender is running. If the jar is less than half full, the contents spatter everywhere! I cannot remove the plastic plug from the lid while it is running or the contents of my blender will be all over my kitchen.There is a VERY GOOD reason most blenders are funnel shaped!"
1,The Blender from Hell,This blender has got to be the worst blender on the market. We have had nothing but problems with it since we got it. The sad part is we only use it to make milk shakes and the stupid thing can't even handle that. First the blade assembly on the bottom of the jar broke. We tried to get the replacement part only to find out it was discontinued so we had to end up buying the whole jar assembly which isn't by any means cheap. Than as if that wasn't enough the rubber coupler that spins the blades lost all the little teeth now the blades won't spin at all. I am about ready to throw this damn thing out the window!!! You need special tools to fix the stupid blender that kitchen aid doesnt have and half the parts are discontinued. I would strongly suggest to anyone who is even thinking about buying this blender to do yourself a favor and buy something else it truly is a piece of [...]!
3,Working but Smelling Bad,We found the blender doing it's job well. Made smoothies with it. When operated for longer than 25 seconds or so....smells like electrical units overheating. If this continues after 5 more uses I'll send it back.
3,Looks better than it works,"I did a ton of research before buying this blender and can't believe how disappointed I am with the performance. It looks beautiful, is easy to clean, the glass is nice and thick, but it can barely chop a banana, let alone frozen fruit or ice. I had an old Hamilton Beach for ten years that cost around $15 and it worked far better than this."
2,leaker,nice mixer works great looks great but seems to leak out the bottom when making drinks?? maybe needs gasket but didnt come with one ??? should of returned
5,Excellent Product,"We are VERY happy with our Kitchen-Aid Blender, and even happier we bought it from Amazon. It looks and works like new, and is getting a LOT of use. I highly recommend this blender!"
2,Quality Made but Poor Design,"A good looking, solid running blender -- with a strong yet quiet motor -- but, if you're going for true BLENDING performance, I would recommend looking elsewhere...I believe that this is the case because the bottom of the jar of the Kitchen-Aid product (the ACTUAL glass container, in which the liquid is mixed and stored) is much too wide and therefore doesn't efficiently ""vortex"" the ingredients into the blade...The result is loooong blending times and small chunks of additives being left, floating near the top of the mixture...Despite that, if you still go for this product, then I would DEFINITELY buy one that is factory reconditioned, because NO WAY it's worth $100."
3,powerful but ..............,This blender is powerful but just does not puree well. No matter how much you run it you still wind up with small chunks. If you need a blender for smoothies or sauces don't get this one.
2,Not as strong as advertised.,"I bought this to make smoothies. Unhappily, it is not handling frozen fruit well (I don't even use ice cubes!) Haven't yet decided to return it, but am coming close."
4,Good stuff!,I replaced both doors on a mustang resto and they sounded like cheap tin cans when closing after putting this stuff in they made a good solid thud. Would be 5 stars but stuff is a little expensive.
4,Decent price for modest quantity of material,"Be aware there is an enormous amount of hype out there regarding sound deading materials. Does this stuff work? Sort of. If you have an older low-end, rattley vehicle, it will certainly help. But if you have a newer high end car, not so much. I installed a lot of the Dynamat Xtreme and it's good stuff and easy to work with. It does help to kill buzzing and resonating from high power speaker installations. Will it make you go ""Wow!!""? Uh, no. But you'll probably say, ""Hey, that's a bit better"". Amazon's price on this is usually pretty good, and free Super Saver shipping makes it even better."
4,Does what it's supposed to do!,"A little pricey, even discounted, but does the job.The roller is only necessary if you want perfection but using your hand to carefully lay it on and press it flat is good enough.It's amazing how well it works. If anyone tells you differently don't listen to them. Dynamat or anything similar will do the job of deadening metallic panels that are ringing. Just use your knuckles before and after, there's definitely a difference in sound. I think there is a certain degree of diminishing returns if you try to cover an entire panel, though. I just used about a 12x12"" sheet for each panel and it seemed to do the job adequately. All in all I'm very satisfied."
5,worked wonderfully,"I bought this to cover some areas that the original dynomatt buy didnt, and it performed much greater than i had ever expected it too."
3,Part of the Lutheran Metal Scene,"The best song for me is square nothing, again the vocals can be barely understood, the music gets annoying after a while because of the lutheran tendency. I gave it average score, cause vocals are barely audible and the music tends to repeat itself. The group could have easily combined many albums together."
5,love this cd,"i really wish inflames would stick to this formula. I like the pattern they had with whoracle, colony, and clay man. these were great cd's. The early releases were also good but this was but inflames was at there best with the 3 cd's i names. as for the newer stuff. reroute to remain was good. soundtrack was ok. and come clarity was good but it was a different style. by the way i sum'd it up this way so i wouldn't have to review each cd individually. you will know how I feel by the stars i give. The truth is though even there new stuff is better than a lot bands releases today."
5,death never sounded so good,"What seperates Clayman from most death metal albums, are the hooks. Not only is this band heavy, they actually know how to write good songs that you can shout along with. The first three songs are prime cuts, should be on the radio, but too heavy. In Flames know how to write great melodys accented by dual guitar harmonies. The heavy riffs sound like an american metal band, but the melodies let you know their from Europe.This band has potential to be big. They deserve it."
2,"OK, but not great","Not the best, not the worst. I do get tiredof the beautiful heroine who just happensto meet the handsome detective who fallsfor her and just happens to provide all thehelp she needs to solve the crime.The writing on the dogs was the best partand the author seems to really like dogs.I think the problem here is that the book hasa checklist feel of including everything that youexpect in a cozy: the plucky heroine, dogs, tryingto start a new life, the best friend who isa character.I got the feeling the next book would also finda way to have recipes in it."
3,Movie in ok condition,Movie was in ok condition. There is quite a bit of color banding throughout. Is in watchable condition.
3,fits good,"product fit well but it was loose. it never held the way i would have liked. it felt good, fit my hand right,bit it just never held it's position. ended up taking it off."
2,Great Book,Dr. Weiner is a great writer and a great researcher. I am glad that I found this book for my library.
4,Hardcore Zen,"I greatly enjoyed this little book and often return to it, randomly picking a page or two to reread. I am new to Zen, but I find it complements my Taoist philosophy and this book is both enjoyable and challenging in a very natural way. A 'wise bird' indeed."
4,"WHY IS THIS AMAZON SALES RANK 261,533?","There simply aren't 261,532 CDs that could or should be considered better than this one. While there's a bit of nostalgia here, the music on this CD is worth your time and attention. The historical context alone makes it even more compelling. A fine example of the Canterbury sound, brother Hopper has done us all a great favor by finally putting this one together. Which is one way to say that it's even worth your money. Whatever you planned on buying today, give it a rest and buy this instead."
3,A new twist for rock'nroll,"I recently saw these guys for the first time at an outdoor festival on Grandfather Mountain in North Carolina. I had never heard of them, but obviously thousands of other people had, because everyone was cramming themselves into every available space. I enjoyed them so much, I bought this CD while at the concert. I listened to it twice on the way home, and I am still listening to it in my home stereo system.The bag pipes make a nice twist to rock'n roll. The guys have fun playing and you can tell it in their songs. Even my husband liked it, and we do not often agree on music. I would refer to it more as alternative music versus Celtic. It is fun no matter what you call it!"
2,If looking for a new Digital Camera...skip this one,"If you're looking for a new Digital Camera, skip this one all together. Being the year 2010 there are a vast amount of newer camera's that will take just the same quality image if not better for less. The bad experiences I had with it are as follows:1. The shutter will give out on you and not turn on the camera.2. The battery life on this is horrible.3. The video is very dark and grainy.4. The LCD screen is small and low res.Seeing I bought this 4 years ago, I can say I learned my lesson...don't become a statistic!! :)"
3,Graphic SF Reader,"The end of the series about the ambiguous shapeshifter Raven Darkholme, and her dangerous games. There are a few shorter stories here, of the more self-contained variety.An interesting series that unfortunately didn't continue, and probably should have been a MAX title to get to its full potential. Bisexual shapeshifting spy/assassin/villain/mothers are not your standard sort of Spider-Man type adventure characters."
3,cute but rotted in a season,"I purchased four of these last Spring for my bush peas; it looked really cute and English garden-y. However, as I took down my garden to compost in the fall, two of the four had rotted off at the ground. Additional, the woven parts are nailed into the uprights at the end of each wicket and the nails pull out by the end of the season. So, great look, but only one season, which makes it feel wasteful. 5 on looks, 1 on durability."
1,"Try ""Cruise Travel"" Magazine","Don't waste your money on Porthole!For much better information on cruises, try ""Cruise Travel"" Magazine. It is by far the best cruise magazine on the market. Although is is only published every two months and isn't very long, it offers up-to-date and useful information on the cruise travel industry and destinations. The Cruise of the Month, Port of the Month, and the Ship of the Month features are great, and the letters to the editor are very well-written and interesting. There are quite a few ads, but they are all relevant to cruising and are helpful when planning a cruise.Cruising is not just for the rich anymore! Cruise Travel Magazine can help you plan the trip of a lifetime. Prothole only caters to rich travelers."
1,Don't bother,"I purchased this book in part due to high reviews. I was disappointed, and sold it in a used book store as soon as I could manage it."
3,not sure if this is the right book,"I'm not sure if this is the right book, but I have read a book titled the Lady and the Unicorn. I'm not sure who the author is but The cover is a painting of the same name as the title. This is a historical fiction book that has quite a bit of facts in it but not so much as you're overwhelmed. A girl against her will is married to a man she does not know and is caught up in a game of intrigues between the powers of England and France. Her new husband allies with England but her father allies with France. Who will she turn to. And will she fall in love with the man forced apon her."
3,Basic Paper Pricking,"This is a good book, however, I did not like the fact that all the patterns must be increased in size from 120% to 150%. It would be much easier to have the patterns regular size. There was enough white space in the book to accomplish that, so I am not sure why the author or publisher chose to make the reader increase the size of the patterns. Other than that, this is a good basic book."
1,this movie's crap,"first off, I just want to say that if I could I would of given this movie no stars. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS-what special efects? when alex transforms into the horse-bird thing it looks like something you would see in the making of a better movie- except it looks like the unedited vesion, a raw computer image, no attemp at making it look real just making the shape and color.THE STORY- the story starts out okay, but later on it begins to make you say ""huh?!"" they diffinetly had a great idea, with the shapeshifter thing, but they turned it into crap. the acting wasn't that great either, I really doubt this movie cost more than $3,000 to $5,000 to make. overall this movie really sucked, I wouldn't recomend it to anyone, not even a family with little kids who would believe alot of things in movies, they would think it's crap too."
1,Very disappointed.,"I am very disappointed with these dolls. The television commercial and when you see them still in the box, leads you to believe that they are pretty posable. Well, they aren't. Their bodies almost look deformed, and they are stuck in that position. They are very beautiful dolls, but they are also such a disappointment. Thats my opinion."
1,Roni size followed the way down,"??? what's this record about???? where is the old roni size?? honestly on this record i can save a couple of song in the first disc and a coulpe in the second (that are the same songs of the first disc mixed......). I've been positively surprised by the first record of roni size, it's about drum'n'bass made with stile, new forms is THE drum'n bass album... in the mode isn't great as new forms but is worth the listening... the others are simply one worst of the other.... this is an album featuring dj die, dj krust and roni size... it feels like music from an eighties videogame... full of boiuncy suonds and without any shade of style and taste... absolutely a record to avoid with touchin down"
1,"it's a cute book, but","It is a cute book, but for the price it doesn't give you a lot movement wise. Great pictures, but if you really want routines and exercises, go for the S factor by Sheila Kelley"
2,Great camera until...it takes the shutter release error,"I've had this camera since it first came out. For a while it was wonderful! It took fantastic pictures and it's lightweight and easy to handle. But... October 2010 (on a very important day) it gave me an error about the shutter release button. A friend that is a professional photographer was able to fix it. In July 2011 I got the same error. When this error comes up, the camera doesn't work at all. I sent the camera off to Nikon and it took them about 8 weeks to supposedly fix it. It cost me about $200 to get it fixed. The error came back in September. You can bang on the camera and get the gears to release and it will work temporarily. I've had it with this camera! Before you buy it, Google ""Nikon Error Press Shutter Release"" and you'll find tons of complaints about it. :( I'm looking for a new camera now."
4,Wonderful Camera,This camera takes great photos you just point and shoot and it takes care of the rest.
5,This camera rocks.,"I don't know if I will regret getting a 6MP camera in the end, but so far I haven't missed the megapixels. What I appreciate so much more than my old point and shoots is that the camera takes the picture when I push the button!! I can't tell you how frustrated I have been until this camera. It is lightweight and easy to handle. For me, it just begs to be used. The biggest decision that I had to make was whether or not to get the second lens. I wish I did."
2,auto mode not working with 18-55mm lens after a year,"My auto mode does not work with the given lens. all of a sudden one fine day it just would not autofocus. I can hear it trying to do something to no avail.then i went in online to look up reviews and there were many similar complaints. Manual does work, so I'm convinced it's in the lens, but with the exact same thing happening to this many people, it must be some sort of defect. sadly most of them faced this issue after a year when the warranty ran out.The only way i can get it to work is by detaching and re attaching the lens on. wish i had read more about this before purchasing this camera. now my warranty is up and nothing can be done."
5,Great Starter SLR,"What a great camera! I spent weeks researching, reading reviews, and trying to decide which camera to buy for my first SLR. I was torn b/t this camera and a Canon Rebel. I am SO glad I went w/ the Nikon D40. I have not been able to put it down since I got it about a month ago. It takes amazing photos, it is easy to use, it's lightweight...overall, a wonderful entry level SLR. I couldn't be happier. AND, amazon had the lowest price of any I found."
5,Good camera,I researched Nikons extensively and decided on the D40 kit. I'm an amateur photographer but am particular about the quality of my shots. I love this camera. It does everything I need it to do and does it well. I've since added a 70-300VR lens for zooms and an 18-200VR lens for a walkaround setup where I can avoid changing lenses and still get decent shots close up or a fair distance away where I want to zoom.
5,Great little camera.,"This is a great camera, very suitable as an introduction to dslr's. Picture quality rivals the bigger brother d80. Goes very well with the sb400 flash.Pro's:Small, light, great battery life, great pictures, great price, well built.Con's:Does not auto focus non afs lenses, no grid lines."
5,Love it!,"I wanted a Digital SLR camera, but most of them were very expensive, and I have been thrilled with the Nikon D40. I also got a speedlight, which helps taking photos inside my house.Nikon SB-400 AF Speedlight for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras"
4,The pictures are awesome but......,"There's no way you fail with this camera. It's perfect at the moment to take pictures. All you pictures are perfect. But there's two little things missing. It can't film. That was a surprise to me. And I can't see the preview in the display, you must look at the scene through the camera as I did with the old ones."
5,Nikon D40,"I have owned many different film and digtial camera over the last 1/2 a century. My Sony 12.1 megapixel point and shoot is only about a month old. For sure this 6.1 MP SLR camera runs circles around any camera I have ever owned. You can treat it like a point and shoot and it does great. Or if you want to get exotic and set everything manually you can do that too. Focus, shutter, aperture, ISO, and lots more.It is light weight and cheap. Nothing else comes close to this camera."
5,Great compact DSLR,"This is a great small DSLR.The price is so reasonable for $499.99 on Amazon with a great kit lens.Anyone who gave it less that 4 stars could not possibly have this camera.When I took it out of the box it was so simple to get beautiful pictures.I also own a D200 which is also a great camera for about 3 times the price, but I wanted something smaller and now I found it.So if your looking for a great small DSLR you can't go wrong."
5,Best value for money,"I've owned this camera for a couple of weeks now, with the 55-200 VR (!) as companion.The camera (both the body and the lenses) are light-weight and natural to operate.The resulting images are very good! I shoot with the 'vivid' color settings and enjoy its colors.The default exposure is often incorrect though, and needs frequent adjustments. Typically -0.3 to -0.7. The controls give readily access to these controls."
5,Nikon D40 - No 2nd thought,"I had Nikon D40 for about three months. This is the first D-SLR I purchased. There are other brands and models I was considering. I mainly picked up this brand/modle becasue of the review and feedback. I am happy with the decision I made. From standard Digital Camera user to D-SLR owner, I only looked for a quality entry SLR with all necessary functions within reasonable price range. No brainer, this stands out in every aspect. I still remember how I shoot pictures by waiting for four seconds after each shot on my old digital camera. Now, it can take upto 10 shots in the same amount of time. This says all!"
1,Sweater Dryer - flimsy and chinsy - poor use.,"Save your money - the product does nothing more a big towel on the floor would not accomplish. I did not realize I am getting gismo that accommodates only 1 and not three sweaters as shown on the picture (that is supposedly the stackable feature of the thing). The mesh I got was torn and looks used (has various color spots), the thing does not hold still and gets disassembled with the tiniest agitation (sweater on it or not)."
2,Small but...,This item appeared to be larger than what I recieved but it still does the job I need it to do.
1,save your money on this product,"The frame was flimsy, the legs wobbled, bottom caps were missing from the legs and the mesh didn't come close to fitting the frame. It was cheap, impossible to put to any use and I have already thrown it away. I wouldn't even feel good to give it to someone else."
3,You Get What You Pay For,Works ok. Light and compact. Works on AA battery. Shortest trim guide is way too long and is hard to get on and off.
5,Absolutely wonderful product!,I already had one of these and it lasts forever but I needed an extra one for traveling.This is a very good trimmer for fine hairs. I especially can trim all around my poodles feet under the pad without worrying about her getting cut. It is good to trim around her face also. I recommend this for anyone to use on their small pets.
3,WAHL 9962 COMPACT TRIMMER,"Nothing good to say about this product. I may have gotten a defective one to be on the fair side. Does not shave, it more like tries to pull the hair out, a little on the painful side."
2,Does not play in U.S. DVD Players,"The DVD I received did not play in any of our DVD players, even though it claims to be formatted for all regions. I did get it to play on our computer, but it is Linux based. I do not know if it will play with Microsoft. The music is good, of course, but the formatting is unacceptable.This DVD was purchased through an independent amazon seller, so I would suggest that anyone wanting to view their DVD go directly through amazon and no one else. I have been having a lot of problems with DVDs ordered from other countries, as well. I was not aware that different DVDs use different formatting, so I'm trying to save everyone else a headache with this warning."
5,Snowstorm Serendipity!,"Stuck in Ithaca at the Statler Hotel on the Cornell campus, finished with the book I was reading and desperate for entertainment, I went into the hotel store to buy something new. This was the only thing that was not a cookbook or a Guide to Cornell - and WHAT A FIND! This book is enough to make me move to Ithaca, and a reminder that there is magic in the world if you believe it is there. Matt Ruff, please be more prolific! Excellent reading for fans of Robbins, Pratchett & Gaiman, and Gorey."
5,I've been a fan of this book for a decade.,"I read this book in 1989 when it was originally published and i recall reading it two or three times and then loaning it to a friend and it's been loaned out ever since. Even so, I have always remembered it and tried to find it several times over the years. Now, with books online I decided to try one more time and find out that ten years later the book is having a successful revival. It's a wonderful, inspirational and magical story that has held my attention for a decade."
5,A wild ride of fun and fantasy!,"I discovered this book just after it was published and just before I got into Cornell and I have read it at least ten times since (I am just four years out of good 'ole Cornell). It it one of my favorite books as it combines true life in Ithaca with a world that you always hoped existed somewhere. It has something for everyone - as it combines several full lentgh stories, which could easily be read independently of one another, into an exciting and fun adventure. I have been patiently waiting for Matt's next book and I am looking forward to reading it - as The Fool On The Hill - was his senior thesis (if I am to believe a professor of his that supposedly helped get it published) - I felt that his book was so fabulous I went out and signed up for a course with his mentor.I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone that likes to daydream!"
1,This book is a mess.,"Ruff's book is a murky morass of inane imagery and strained humor. The novel was written while he was still in school, and it shows in the smug prose and deep-as-a-kiddy-pool characterizations. Cornell should be embarassed, although the sprites and faeries would liven up a dreary Ithacan spring. The novel does show that he actually read all of the books he was assigned in school, and more. He just didn't get much out of them. His book is wide in scope and absolutely devoid of substance. Why bother?"
5,A must of modern fantasy,"There 's a new genre out there which is called ""modern fantasy.""Sure there may be a dragon, a demon, or other midevil creatures, but its mindset and period is of current times.Matt Ruff recreates our world with some of the most interesting characters, funny situations, and imaginative plotlines ever.For those who read the book, im sure you can agree, you don't want to leave it. You wish you knew these characters and hung out with them.How many of us would like to be a memeber of the Tolkien house? Or watched the battle with the dragon?Its touching, funny, idealistic, sad, and a pure pleasure to read.For those who have read this book, congrats for finding one of those hidden treasures.For those who haven't read this book, search it out and you won't be disappointed.As a matter of fact, i haven't read it recently...(btw, if you enjoy Ruff you might like Christopher Moore. Check him out too)"
5,"KitchenAid Ultra Power 11-Cup Food Processor, Factory-Recon",After having surgery on both hands I found myself not being able to do the many things that I loved. But after purchasing the kitchenaid food processor I am now but into the race. I was a bit worried about buying a factory reconditioned item but knowing the kitchenaid brand name I knew that I had made a smart choice. My item came just as new as a new one...I just love it!!!!
1,"Like military intelligence, Archos' support is an oxymoron.","I bought a model direct from Archos, and needed shipping information. Did I get any response to my emails? My calls? My pleas to contact me? In the end, I had no end of paperwork trouble because they couldn't be bothered to do their job properly, and swore I would never, ever, ever buy anything else of theirs in the future. So ask yourself this before you buy: Why should you support their company if they won't support you?"
2,Good value but no OGG Vorbis support!,"Even the excellent Rockbox firmware is unable to support the Ogg format on this device, due to the company being unwilling to release any specifications, nor support it themselves. For this reason, I can only recommend that you AVOID this player, and opt for the much cooler Rio Karma, or any other Ogg-compatible player. Please do not settle for proprietary file formats and allow manufacturers to ignore their customers' needs!"
1,Works - if you are lucky,"This would be an item I would own if it would work as advertized. Worked fine for 3 hours and then just decided it not to boot up anymore! It actaully stayed on for another hour as it would not even accept a power cycle.Also I am worried that there are so many inconsistencies in the packaging. 3 of us bought this and each seemed to have a part extra or missing!!! Starts to question their quality control.My friend bought one and his seems to work like a champ - again it is the inconsistency that bothers me and the JB has since been returned for a refund.My suggestion, wait for a while before going for an Archos product."
4,The IPOD killer,"This is a great device that in my opinion rivals the IPOD and does much more.It records from several sources (line in, built in mic, digital in).Storage is 20gigs so it serves as a good size portable harddrive for music, backups or whatever else you fancy.The reason I give it 4 is because the software is a little quirky and teh built in microphone records some hard drive noise. Since I've bought it I've replaced it with the open source Rockbox software:http://rockbox.haxx.se/The system performance and features have gotten much better since.This is a great little performer for an awesome price."
1,Dont buy it - not worth even if priced at $100,"I bought the Archos 20 GB Jukebox even after reading some negative feedbacks thinking that a device cannot be so bad that it is not even worth $100 (after mail - in and Gold Box discounts).Oh dear, I was so wrong. Day 1 the AC adapter connection in the device failed. Returned it back immediately to get refund.Dont buy it!!!"
2,Go iPod or Nomad,"I bought this product about a year ago so I could listen to music in my car, load photos from the Compact Flash adapter (a great idea I will say), and watch some movies on the LCD.It started out working out very well, until it broke. The unit simply would not stay on for more then five seconds. After paying some money to send it in and get it repaired, the LCD then broke within a month or two of getting it back. Rockin'. I can still play it in my car by just turning it on and hitting play a couple times, but that not what I paid several hundred dollars for. Plus the battery life sucks.Like the title suggests, skip on this one."
3,Proceed with caution,"The bad - poor quality control and build quality (especially solder joints) on most Archos units, the included software is inefficient and ackward, poor tech support from manufacturerThe good - you won't even get close to 20 GB for this price with any other unit, huge active user support base out there (check out Archos_devices, archos, archosjukebox6000 at Yahoo Groups), great freeware OS (Rockbox), easily replacable NiMH AA batteriesIn summary... if you're comfortable with computers & technology and maybe even don't mind poking around in electronics, this unit can be a great value. If things breaking scares you and you don't know what an OS is, the iPod is made just for you."
2,Ok! for a while...,My dad bought this product for me. it was ok for a while then it started stalling and not working at all. listen to me save up a bit more money and buy an ipod at least it fail on u:(
5,Very good price for the value!,I recommend this product for anyone who wants a mp3 player with high storage capacity for a low price. Excellent sound quality as well. If you want to pay double? Get a iPod.
1,"Spotty quality, but inexpensive!","Housed in a bulky, industrial casing, the Archos Jukebox Recorder offers a great deal of functionality for the money. Unfortunately the poor construction is evident from the unweildy form factor (cheap casing and mushy buttons) and unpredictable quality. Although I've had mine for a solid year of reasonable performance, the first two units I owned failed to work. My experience with customer support was just as bad.At its current price point, the Archos is not a bad choice given its ease of use as a portable hard drive. With the Rockbox firmware it becomes a good MP3 player. Unless you're willing to risk a poor quality product and brave Archos support, I'd be wary. Amazon has great return policies, so you may be okay with chancing the spotty quality."
3,The quality of printing is rather bad,"I was happy to see this book reprinted. However, once I took a look on it, I realized that I have to return it back to Amazon. All the pictures in the book are black and barely readable, and about 5 pages in the appendix are printed upside down. The text sometimes is pale and sometimes too black, the quality of printing varies by the page. The overall impression is that the book is of cheap quality, which makes the price of $37 quite unreasonable. This is the third book by Wipf & Stock publishing house that upsets me, and I'm afraid I would have to avoid buying their books in the future. As for Amazon service, it was great as usual."
3,Lots of words--one major recommendation,"This book presents one major theorem and severalhundred pages of proofs. Save your money and investin Vanguard Index funds...no load, low fees, andbetter performance over time than stock pickin'.There...that's it."
3,"You should read this book, not believe it","So many reviews are either five star or one. They all seem to miss the point. This book is great. It is well written, informative, and enlightening. It just shouldn't be used as a basis for investing. It is wrong. But, if you only read the books that espouse what is right, you'll never really know how the other side got to their belief system. Instead of railing against 'Random Walk', read it with a caution eye towards why it is so compelling to so many people. Then read anything recommended by Buffett, and save your fun money for Vegas."
4,Plain and simple advise...,"I have read so many investment strategy books. And I have tried some of the formulas for success as prescribed. However in the end, the advice from this book makes the most sense to me. I have paid for advice and followed it with trailing stops on stocks. From my own personal experience it doesn't matter how much you pay for the advice, it's usually not worth it.I am going the easy and sensible way from now on.You may find this link useful as well. [...]"
1,Utter baloney,"Only an academic such as Malkiel could possibly come up with such utter drivel. Following the author's advice, one would have gotten killed in the 2002 market, all the while believing that outperforming the market is impossible. Nuts! If you want to see your investments underperform and then go up in smoke one day, read this book carefully and follow its advice. You will end up poor, broke and subsisting on your Social Security checks. Better yet, if you believe that coin flips and stock market price moves are equivalent because the charts look similar, do yourself a favor and stick your money in a CD. One's time would be better spent reading Graham's ""The Intelligent Investor."""
2,Latter editions refute is own argument,"This is a useful book to understand the whole efficient market idea. It explains very well why short term speculation is very difficult, but falls short of holding up the efficient market hypothesis in it's most rigorous form.The latest editions of the book go through enormous contortions to maintain the efficient market thesis despite so much evidence to the contrary a lot of which he actually discusses but fails to refute. At one point he actually recommends that you try to time any NEW money you have to commit to the markets. Of course there is no reason given why new money should treated any differently than money already under risk. I guess his answer would be transaction costs? I find that very weak.Keeping cash around for buying when markets are cheaper, and selling some of your holdings when markets get silly is so basic to professional risk management, that it is shameless for him to keep touting this stuff."
5,The Truth about Financial Investing,"This should be the basis for a mandatory course in how to handle your money. It should start with Grade One and be finished by the sophomore year.No ""pro"" is the least interested in making you money. Find out about the corruption rampant in the financial world."
4,"Beyond surface level, but not too technical","After reading Elements of Investing, I chose to follow up my research into investing by reading this book. I was satisfied with the depth and insight presented in the book."
5,Charming gift,I bought 6 or 7 and gave as gifts. Recipients were delighted at it at how unique the gift. Marvelous
3,i cant believe this,"this game reeks of a series gone bad. in 1 + 2 you could pull insane tricks, keep longer grinds, use better skateparks, and not have to worry about the stupidest goals in the world. this game is basicly 4 with big courses you cant do tricks on and a career mode. they seem to have foregotten that in 2 that they had the same thing were you skate for cash to get boards and stat points. this game shows how far this series has gone down hill. for the price of this game get hawk 1+2 and shaun palmer ( like hawk but on snowboards and even better)."
3,alright...,"I've played Tony Hawk since the first one came out on N64. Graphics are good in TH Underground. Gets boring after you've beat it. The objectives should have more to do with skating. Some objectives on that game have to do with crap like rescuing ppl. I buy the frekin game to SKATE. Thats why it only deserves a 3 outta 5, cuz it needs a new edge. Its not fun after you beat it becuz if you play it again, its pointless. LaTer."
4,Generic,"I like this game and all, great graphics but wayyyy to easy... there needs to be more stages or more challenges. for your advice i'd rent the game... bcuz i beat it n baout 6 hours, it wasnt too hard. I like the way how you can design your board but i dont think you can put enough letters on your board... also i dont like how everything bad happens all at once, wuts the chance its going to in real life? I'd have to say the best thing on this game is how you can design your own tricks thats pretty cool but it dont give you alot of points if u make a very hard trick.... this game gets 2 stars from me!"
2,Great game... if you like finishing a game quickly,"What happened? This Tony Hawk game is the most visually appealing in the series, the controls are butter, the music is hot (Murs and Busdriver on the soundtrack? Crazy!!) but it is a disappointment. I played the game for maybe an hour at a stretch, and beat the whole thing in a week. That is terrible! Most of the other Hawk games were much more challenging; this one falls short. The driving is lame, and being able to get off your board is cool, but not that cool. Buy it used, or rent it. Save your money for the new GTA box set (which is SUPER HOT!)."
2,You might need the Complementary Book to follow this video,"I wasn't very impressed with the video. I didn't read the book. Maybe the book should be used along with the video. Harald's explanations and demontrations are very fast. At least too fast for me. He starts the video with a reasonable structure, then the structure somehow dissapears. He cruised by on the bumps and powder sections.As I said, maybe the book should fill in the gaps. If you only watch the video you need to be an ""expert"" skier to keep up. I do not recommend it for Beginners or Intermediates.If you are a Beginner/ Intermediate I highly recommend Lito Tejada's Breakthrough series."
5,HP Photosmart M425 Camera,"Can't remember exactly when I bought this camera, but it has been years. It has never given me trouble. It's easy to use,and makes beautiful pix. My only problem now is figuring out which memory card to buy for it."
5,"H,P. Photosmart camera",Was very satisfied with my purchase. I wanted a Camera that was just like the one I had. This one works fine & has all the features that I like. Would recomend anyone to use this source. H D
3,ok but could be better,"It's a pretty good camera, I haven't had it for more then a month now so I can't tell you if it breaks easily. I kind of regret buying it only because I feel I should've spent the extra and got a cannon power shot. Honestly though this is not a bad camera, you get what you paid for. WARNING: The one thing I HATE about it is that there is no audio (sound) when you play back a video on the camera. There is only sound when you put it on a computer. Besides this, it does what it is suppose to do."
1,Where's my Hotdog?!?!?!,"They put 48 songs on this set but leave off ""Planet Hotdog""!!! Why can we not get the entire soundtrack? After ""Planet Schmanet Janet"", it is supposed to go right into ""Planet Hotdog"" and they CUT IT OFF!!! This really cheeses me off to no end!!!"
3,Pneumatic 5 Gallon air tank,"The price was certainly right, and this would be a great item for random garage use. But I needed it for a specific purpose and I needed it to be 5 gallons. The box and the stickers on the tank all say 5 gallons, but I measured it and it is only 4 gallons. Also the dimensions they give on the gotestuff.com website are incorrect.There are also loose pieces of something sliding around inside of it."
2,NOT HAPPY,I HAVE USED THESE AIR FRESHENERS FOR 30 YEARS..THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE SPICE SCENT WASNT THERE IT IS MORE LIKE CINNAMON AND ISNT VERY STRONG ..I BELIEVE THESE ITEMS WERE OLD...I WONT ORDER AGAIN...
5,Excellent display of elite's weaponry.,"Kevin Dockery, an expert in SEALS history, has given us the unique opportunity to visit the elite's weaponry which has been kept in the dark. Anyone interested in reading the increasingly growing SEALS material, will definitely enjoy this book. It places the SEALS weapons consonant to what is mentioned in the books. This weapons encyclopedia clears a fog existing in the elite's pocketbooks that are available to us through amazon.com. Kevin is without questions, the master writer and a knowledgeable historian in elite's forces belic activities. I am always looking forward to his books. P. Mendez, Jr., MD"
4,Definitely worth reading!,"When I picked up ""Like Boogie On Tuesday..."" (Linda's first novel) I never expected to fall in love with it. Linda is extremely talented and artistic.She conveyed so much in all her characters. When she describes things I could actually, see, feel and taste it. Not many authors can do that. She has a keen understanding of how the world works and is not afraid to express things that we are all feeling. Fever is a wonderful sequal to ""Boogie"" I got to go on with all the characters and discover where life led them...the moral of the story is, that life is just one big journey, happiness isn't an outcome but a journey and ride through life.Thank you for sharing yourself with the readers of the world"
5,MUST buy,"This is worth every penny. I thought that I was an Etta James fan before, but I had no idea what I was missing! This collection of 3 CDs has all of the hits that you love and many more hidden gems that you will come to love. I highly recommend this collection to anyone who loves the music of Etta. The collection also has some history of her life and her music along with pictures in a booklet."
5,The Man in Full,"The book is a treasure for the conquistadors of the useless, and I am one of them. Snip: (...)"
3,good product with several boken,"I was pleased with the product, except that several were broken, and with that I was disappointed. The pens that were not broken work well and they were a hit when we gave them out"
2,too complicated for this senior citizen!,"I grew up tuning a crystal radio set. I remember when FM made its appearance and I couldn't afford to buy a receiver. Then came transistors; things got cheaper and more portable. Radios and I go back to the years of cereal box serials. Now my wife bought me this radio for Christmas. The reception is no better than my old table set and navigating the buttons is all but impossible. I even broke down and read the instructions! Well, good luck with that. The font is microscopic and the illustrations undecipherable. There is an ""alarm"" system standard on this model which keeps shutting off the sound at frequent intervals. Putting in the settings has not been accomplished in several months. The antenna reach doesn't seem to improve reception. Trying to increase volume somehow changes the band width. Frankly, for my simple needs I see no advantage over a yard sale box radio."
2,Looking For New Radio 2 Years Later,"My first complaint is that the tuning knob has two circular rows of little sharp dimples that eventually irritate your fingertip with their scrubbing actuation as you spin the dial (and you do this a LOT when searching). How about a nice smooth indented divet?Secondly, mine has an over-modulation or equalization problem with the audio. It is slightly distorted through the speaker, headphones and the line out jack even at low levels. This happens on full signal strength AM or shortwave signals. It needs an equalizer!!! It sounds like someone is talking too close into a microphone. FM sounds better but I bought this for listening to voice.Maybe I got a lemon, but I concur with all the minor complaints in the other reviews also. I'm looking for a new radio and found this one again, so I thought I would type this up now. I have had the radio for two years."
3,Bought this for AM reception,"I am a casual radio listener - I sometimes like to listen to AM stations in the evening. I bought this because the reviews indicated that it had good AM reception so I thought it would be better than the >20 year old little Walkman radio that I have been using all along. Unfortunately, it wasn't - side by side comparison showed no difference. It's possible that using the supplied antenna (basically a long wire with a plug on one end) properly could help - I didn't know exactly what to do with it but everything I tried didn't help. There are also loop antennas that you can buy to improve AM reception but that was going way beyond what I wanted to do. I should also mention that I did a quick test of the radio outside of my house, to minimize possible interference, and didn't see much difference.So I returned the item. It did seem to be well-designed, however, and had a lot of functionality. Maybe someone more knowledgeable of radio reception could get more out of it."
1,UNACCEPTABLE QUALITY,i purchased a kaito 1103 from amazon several months age after reading favorable reviews.this radio is the worst purchase i have ever made. after weeks of annoying intermittent on and offaudio the radio now cannot be turned on at all. the many other gripes i had with this radio such as poor selectivity and sensitivity are now immaterial.
3,ohhh please,"this is another my scene doll! it has great fashions and pretty makeup but if you havnt noticed when you get a my scene, after one day it ends in your closet. please dont get her get the game its way better."
5,"Amazing book! A ""must read"" for leaders in any field.","I thought this was going to be just another book on ""how to be a leader."" I was pleasantly surprised by the powerful insights of the authors. Randy Haveson's chapter on Courage was particularly engaging. His story is truly heroic. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to lead and not just follow."
1,A Night In London - Mark Knofler,"I will buy a copy of this production when the DVD producer puts the whole concert on DVD or as much of the show as was captured on the VHS when it was released. Until then, no sale."
3,"Why, oh Lord?","Why in God's name would anyone release an edited version of an otherwise fabulous show? Especially when the two edited songs (read ""missing completely"") are arguably among Dire Straits' most celebrated works? Cut ""sultans of Swing"" and ""Money for Nothing""? Are they nuts? Jesus, what a disappointment...I wish I hadn't sold my VHS copy a couple of years ago. The makers of this disc should be ashamed."
3,Mark Never Let Loose,"Interesting songs, instruments, and guests, but I would have enjoyed a little more of Knopler's higher energy tunes.Landreth was great!"
5,Best of its Kind,"John Herman Randall is one of the best writers of introductory and intermediate material related to philosophy, and this book, like his excellent introduction to Aristotle, is written densely so that no confusing concepts intervene and contravene. This makes the material informative upon second and third readings, knowing that what it is you're rereading is really important, not just another way of presenting the material. All major subjects are covered in a nonprejudicial way. It's an excellent resource for people first encountering philosophy or those who have forgotten some of philosophy's nuances on the subject. A major resource for all readers of philosophy."
2,"Ok, if you have easy to curl hair","This set was ok, but didn't really work for me. It never got hot enough to really smooth or curl my hair. It only has an on/off switch, and doesn't have an option to go hotter or cooler. If your hair isn't very thick or unruly, this would work very well for you."
3,Tony Hawk Underground PS2 Game,"Good game if you like Tony Hawk and scate boarding. I personally just thought this game was okay as far as ""fun"" goes. No peoblems though, game worked perfect :)"
1,this game is good BUT THE SIMS 2 IS WAY BETTER,"THE GRAPHICS ARE BETTER, YOU MAY PLAY VIDEO GAMES, MORE ITEMS,AND MORE BUILDING TOOLS.THE SIMS 2 IS BETTER........."
2,certainly a step backwards!,"This game is nothing compared to the previous four releases. it has lost all of it's orginality. What happened to goals like grinding helicopter blades, grinding on the backs of elephants to make them stampede, and who can forget dodging the monkey droppings. I think this game needs more violence and certainly some weapons for the characters. In two player mode there needs to be a gladiator option and free skate should include a free-for-all riot option. I gave this game two stars only because I was able to upload a picture of my cats face onto the characters body and I named my character Catman!"
3,Good game but i have played better...,"I agree this is a very good game but I have played better. I belive Donkey Kong is a much better game.For one thing Donkey Kong is an action packed game with fun filled levels,and at the same time it is challenging and exciting. DONKEY KONG FOR LIFE."
2,The most anyoing review,"Tony Hawks Underground is awesome you can drive go-caurts and go on 9 awesome levels. Thoughes 9 levels are huge. In it you are an unknown punk. I have Tony Hawks Underground and its AWESOME!! If you like fun games this is one of em. I promise you, you will love this game. Tony Hawks Underground should be rated 5 stars not 4. I wonder who would rate it 4. Anyway buy or rent Tony Hawks Undergound and write a review.P.S. Please don't put anything under 2 stars, im just kidding write what ever you want!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And why does my review have to be 2 stars"
3,i say oye to this game,this game is a HUGE dissapointment to me... for i have been with the seiries from the start and usually it takes awhile to beat the game all the way through... or atleast somewhat of a challenge the first time through.... i played this game at my friends house... i got about 2/3 through the game.... it is way too short i know that i was that far because my friend beat it... then went through again to where i am and then we both got bored of it... the game has a great first impression but overall it could be a lot better.... i was personally extremely dissapointed... and i feel that they should have worked harder at it...i was always a big fan of the level creator... i liked to mess around with it.. but in this game i tried it and was dissapointed... personally i liked thps4 soo much better just because it is longer and funner to me anyways
2,Tony Hawk Undergound - As good as they claim?,"My first opinion after recieving the game for Christmas was ""Oooh, look at the pretty graphics"". The graphics are much better in this game than all of the previous versions.Though the graphics are nicer, it comes at a cost. The Tony Hawk game that took hours and hours to beat before can now be completed beaten within the first hour and a half - two hours after opening the game. The challenges are fun, don't get me wrong, but they are far too easy. I was expecting this one to be just as dificult..if not more than all of the other version, but it's easier than Tony Hawk 1 and it takes a fraction of the time to complete.If you're looking for a game that takes time and skill, this is not the game for you. I would get the earlier versions if you haven't got them, but don't waste your money on this one."
4,T.H.U.G,"This game is similar to the first few ones but with much more tricks,levels and skaters you can create or choose its no wonder this game is going fast. In this game you go from being a unknown skater in your home town of New Jersey to making it big in the future level to Hawaii or Moscow. Meet the pros along the way including Chad Muska and of course Tony Hawk. Along side you best friend Eric and duck tape skateboard you'll start to make it big in no time but only if you can pull the big tricks under pressure"
2,Solar Rock Flood Lights,"Even after two full days of sunshine for charging the batteries, the illumination output of these ""rock flood lights"" is pathetic. Combined with the poor workmanship of manufacture, I would not recommmend buying these at any price. I feel taken as it is."
4,good introduction to DSP,"This is a good book for readers who didn't have much background in math and DSP fields. It contains lots of useful information. But for a experienced engineer or colleage students, this book is a little too easy."
1,Wierless 802.11B in 2011!!! come on!!,Do not buy this adapter. In the year 2009 everything switched over to 802.11 N wifi and is now the current standard. N wifi blows B wifi away at a whopping 300mbs per second where as B wifi is running at 11mbs per second. If you buy this device you are buying something that is 2-3 generations outdated.
2,Get WET11 instead!,"That's right, get WET11 instead, although it may be a little more money. Because with the game adapter, after a month, I never got a signal anymore, I have no clue why. Then I bought the WET11 from Linksys, and it works much better, I get a signal in my basement from the second floor! I use 64-bit encryption and it was very easy to configure! The Wet11 also gets a higher range capacity, around 250 feet indoors, the game adapter, I have no clue cause it never said on the box or instruction booklet. I have Xbox live, and if you need a wireless solution WET11 is your best bet!"
1,Wire-LESS is the word,"This adapter is easy to set up and begin to use, Unfortunately the games become choppy and the connection looks compromised. Not a good fit for say online sports games."
3,Works...,"The Linksys WGA11B Wireless-B Game Adapter works as a simple game adapter, but I would not recommend it to anyone using newer wireless security protocols (WPA/WPA2). The adapter lacks support for WPA and WPA2, and from what I have heard Linksys does not plan on updating the firmware to support either.While this product does work, it is a featureless adapter.I returned it a few hours after buying it, and instead purchased the Zyxel P330W. I would not understand why anyone would pay for an outdated adapter when routers that support bridging, like the Zyxel P330W (similar pricing), exists. With the way computers and consoles are starting to interact, it would be a shame to only transfer files at B speeds, especially when it comes to file transfers or video streaming."
4,Works for solo XBOX 360 play,Product works fine for connecting to wireless network and online. I do not play online multiplayer and do not think this would be fast enough for that.
3,Horrible support!,"I purchased this item, and it appears to be working great, but I was having trouble connecting to my router (I have previous computer experience, I was just having a problem because it required a password, which didn't seem to work well with the device). I called up their technical support and they were WORTHLESS. After being put on hold numerous times for about an hour, we accomplished nothing. They would constantly forget the steps that were being taken to configure this product and they would not listen (or remember the details of my problems). If you are confident that this can be hooked up without a problem, purchase this item, if not, STAY AWAY!"
3,eeh,this product only works with the wireless linksys b router.i have a g router. a newer version. and it doesn't work.you can get your wireless g router downgraded which is what i'm doing or you have to buy the 100 dollar game adapteri'm sure this product will be fine when i can use it.
1,OMG This adapter sucks,"I ordered this adapter thinking it would be a simple set up. The first adapter I received I couldnt configure and I called in my IT friends and they worked on it. They couldnt get it to work. So I had a new one sent to me and I could get it to configure but couldnt connect. As my IT put it, this adapter is a piece of S@#t. I spent a couple of nights working on this and I have to say, How can you make a junk product like this and tell people its easy to use. I had guys who used testing equipment to figure out what the problem is. Dont waste your time and buy something else."
5,Great outdated piece of hardware...,"I don't know why everybody keeps saying this thing is so horrible. I used this thing with my original xbox, and I have been using it with my Xbox 360 for the past 5 years, I never experience lag, my router is halfway across the house, and it works great! I have a netflix membership and all my movies stream flawlessly with this adapter. And if you enable access control on your router, then you don't need to worry about your security settings. Learn how to use the damn thing before you give it a horrible review."
3,not what i was looking for,"I was more looking for the essence of Cousins philosophy and any new research. This book is more Like ""Norm's adventures at Med School"". I should have just read the first book. I think Cousins has streched two books worth of material into about 8 books and this one is not what i was looking for."
2,"Would NOT recommend: Constant static, poor design","Altec Lansing really screwed up on this one (VS2121)... I had read all the reviews about there being some static noise, but I thought I'd be the exception. Wrong.They may look great, but there is a constant buzzing sound from some kind of interference, and it's a problem with the design, not my setup. The volume control is on the side, so is hard to see, and there is no actual power button, so that static noise will always be there unless you UNPLUG the speakers. I thought the sub sound was not very great, and there it has no volume control.After owning these speakers for just one week, the right speaker blew out! Now I've exchanged them for the Logitech X-230's.... MUCH better.Bottomline: skip these Altecs and find something more well-designed."
2,Too Much Static,"They sound fine, but they pick up static from EVERYTHING. Especially cell phones. It's very annoying. I wouldn't recommend these at all!"
3,not that great,"OK for the price, but still kinda cheap product.sounds is not that great.buy a different set."
2,BIIG PIMPIN,"OOOK, ive been waiting for this game to come out for a long time, thinkin yeah, secret of mana was awesome, so legend of mana is gonna be twice as good. WRONG. For one the game has no story line what so ever, and u really don't get involved in even your own character. Its just a bunch of pointless five minute adventures that lead to no where. You also have noo freedom of movement in the field world at all, its from one place to the next, no fighting. I'm sure all of your remember when your weapons get upgraded...well nope not in this game, which was one of my favorite options. Really i guess its the story line im disappointed in, i guess the first just won't be beat. I did have to give it two stars though because it gets kinda cool near the end when you get to do cool things with your ""town"". Overall id say that you'd be more satisfied with Superman64 or going to see Battlefield Earth."
5,Need more game like this,This is a awesome game. I like this game because it fights by skill not like final fantasy and most of other game that fough one at a time. The graphic seem really nice too. I wish they have more of these kind of games.
5,A must read for all those who know the meaning of family.,This work was a delight to read. It exemplifies the meaning of family. The writing flowed smoothly and held my attenton easily. I would highly recommend it to anyone who has a deep appreciation for family history.
4,Excellent,"I found the large surface to be very handy. I used to feel the compulsive need to move my mouse pad around, but no longer. The sticky base works quite well and keeps the pad from sliding around. The only downside I found is that the sticky pad left some residue on one side that ate through the logo and caused a bit of an uneven surface. Not a huge deal as I am using the other side anyway, but be wary of that."
3,I think there is better than this(it is so simple),I'm trying it now for two weeks (since the writing of this review). It is so simple that i hoped i bought some thing more COMFORTABLE than this. I suggest for the company to add a wrest pad to it.
1,"I am tried of Barbie, end it NOW","Barbie dolls are getting old, come up with something original. Barbie is not special just because it's a girl toy."
4,"VERY cute, but one disappointment","I have to agree..she is very cute, even with pink hair. However, i don't know if anyone has noticed that on the back of the box it states: ""magical"" glowing wings. They don't glow! I was under the impression that the plastic wings glowed in the dark if you held them up to the light for a few seconds...but they don't. they are decorated with sparkle/glitter but nothing ""GLOWS"". Still a VERY cute barbie and I would buy the other ones in the collection."
1,oops!,"There is nothing wrong with this product, it's just that I meant to order bao-ding balls (a tennis elbow thing) & not ben-wa balls (a sex thing)."
4,Coby 2GB Player,"This product performs well except for the earphones, I exchanged the product once due to failure, and now they are starting to fail again, everything else is working fine. I will recommend you use another set of earphones the ones included leave a lot to be desired."
3,Not a bad small sized player,"The interface is of course clunky compared to the iPod, but that's why you buy an iPod...I needed something a lot less expensive i.e. disposable should I forget it somewhere...this is perfect...2 gig is more than enough to handle the hour long bus ride...good battery life as well...and easy to transfer files but they have to be MP3...which isn't that bad for an iTunes user..."
3,A Little Disappointed,"Within days of using this mp3 player, a couple of issues surfaced. My computer almost never detects it when connected. It takes several tries before the computer detects it, otherwise I can't add any music.... isn't that the whole idea of this thing? Also, the + button doesn't work well. I have to press it a few times to adjust the volume by 1 level. One minor issue is that when I add a song, it goes to the bottom of the playlist rather than in alphabetical order, as it is on my hard drive. Not a big deal, but I prefer to have the songs listed in alphabetical order.On the plus side, it plays my mp3s & favorite radio station well. The sound quality is decent, too.Over all, I'm disappointed... but hey, you get what you pay for... I would recommend getting something better, but do some research before buying! This was my first portable mp3 player, but considering my bad experience with it, I'm not too optimistic about the next one I'm planning to buy."
3,Did not work well for recording,"Probably not bad product for the price. But I bought it to use as a pocker recorder to easily capture ideas. The actual recording works well, but there's way too much menu navigation to get to record something. Not a procedure I would do while driving.Also was counting that the 2GB would let me replace my current USB flash drive that I carry around. Unfortunately found that it would not allow anything other than music files. I don't mean it would not ""play"" a Word document, a restriction which makes sense. I mean it would not even allow me to put the Word document on the disk."
3,No Joyriding with Frank?,"I was searching for his new album with his new band and saw that a lot of their older stuff was re-released with extra tracks. Well in this particular case it is a travesty of justice as it looks like they removed the classic Joyriding with Frank to fit the bonus tracks on. The song in question is basically an extended live verision of Move Right In that just jams on and on for some 30+ minutes, and was the high point of the recording. I would have rather seen it remastered intact than re-released with bonus tracks that replace the high point of the album."
3,Best of Ernest Tubb,"Perhaps best appreciated by someone who is looking to fill out a collection of earlier western music. The sound quality is good for its time, and the arrangements are pretty, with a beautiful rendition of ""Walkin' the Floor Over You"", but most people would be happier with the livelier Asleep at the Wheel versions of this and other numbers."
4,robert fuller,"I have had the pleasure of meeting robert he is very nice . the series is good. you cant go wrong with a westerns,"
4,Laramie the Final Season,"The color is much better than the black and white. We like to say thing like ""that was a rukus"" for a fight or when either Slim or Jake has an episode where they go on a trip that it's a ""whirlwind adventure"". Good old fashioned Western adventure."
5,Great Old Western,I've always been a Robert Fuller fan. Laramie was one of my favorites as a kid. Glad to see it on DVD.Surprisingly good quality for a TV show that old. Well worth the price.
2,Disappointed with this one,My wife purchased this for me for Christmas and we just got around to viewing the first episode last night. One reason I wanted this set was it was in color but the colors are very faded/ washed and the sound quality is terrible also. I have black and white DVD sets from older shows than this that are much better quality. The price for this was way too much for the quality; this is very disappointing.
1,Only if you're really blue....,"This book seemed to be really interesting; after I've read it, I feel to have wasted my time. I don't know who could find this work useful; the author writes in a pleasant way, but the content is really poor.If you're a dramatist -and you feel blue- this book can help you; but you'll never find here any practical suggestion - only encouragements."
4,It works for me,"Flimsy construction, but it does the job. I used to have a Little Green machine, but the suction was bad and you are on your hands and knees to use it. This model is used upright like a vacume cleaner, but folds down small for storage. The solution and discharge tanks are easy to clean and insert easily into place. There is only one strange feature - sometimes the rotating brushes in the base don't work. I have found that this unit is very particular about being turned on in a specific sequence. Handle up - turn on power - foot pedal to recline the handle. If you recline the handle before turning on the power, the brushes won't spin."
1,Didn't work right out of the box,"Brand new never used unit. Scrubbing rotating brushes didn't rotate AT ALL. Not even a little. Period. Hand tool's brushes rotated slowly and inconsistantly--mostly when held upside down. Not strong enough to clean. Without brushes to scrub, it pretty much just wets the floor with soap and water then sucks it up. If there's something I'm not getting please tell me. Some trick to get the brushes to move? Should work easily right out of the box."
1,An okay book with too many errors,"While this book provides some good basic information, it has several serious errors. It covers good material and all the important topics for a beginning book. However, one of the most notable errors are a graph of current in an inductor on page 159, which does not match the circuit that is associated with it. Particularly, the current is shown decreasing gradually after the switch, which is in series with the inductor, is opened. Another problem is the statement that any two rectivier diodes can be paralleled and the current ratings will add, which is simply not true. These errors show a lack of careful writing and reviewing. I think this book is not worth the price and can be misleading."
2,"Curb--as always, the Worst Reissue Label In The Universe","In which the record company implies that the artist has only turned out 12 songs worth compiling in five decades. Does this disc even run longer than 30 minutes? The dumbness within the dumbness is that these songs actually span about 30 years. Which according to most number systems is kinda not five decades.If you're this interested, go for Rhino's 30th Anniversary Collection. For five bucks more, you get 24 hits instead of the 12 Curb parcels out. All but the last three tracks here are there as well. Frustratingly, Curb manages to include one key hit (to these ears, anyway) not on the Rhino set--""Hold Me Til The Morning Comes"" is a great ballad (to these ears, anyway) featuring Peter Cetera on backing vocals. It nicked the Top 40 (peaking at #40) in 1983, making Anka one of the few artists to hit in the 50's, 60's, 70's, and 80's. Its presence here justifies, unfortunately, the existence of this skimpy thing."
1,Sonic abomination,"Here it is.The horror.The sonic abomination.The hell spawn that was released by Anka onto AM radio in 1974 and makes us envy the deaf today.Yes, I am speaking of Paul Anka & Odia Coates duet ""(You're) Having My Baby.""Upon Anka's release of this atrocity, William Shatner need never fear again that his ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" cover will go down in history as the world's worst song.Despite his other achievements, Anka buried his credibility with this repulsive treacle. Even Frank Sinatra's ""Mama Will Bark"" has a redeeming note in it, unbearably absent from Anka's sonic turd. It manages to combine the worst features of Captain & Tennille's ""Muskrat Love"" and the base carnality of any song by Mr. Meat Loaf.Perhaps George Orwell's prophetic ""memory holes"" cannot arrive soon enough. Would that we had them now and could confine every copy of this album to the flames, and had the cheap gin to wash the memory of ever hearing it from our damaged grey sludge."
1,Horrible,"There isn't anything good about this product. It doesn't absorb into my skin, stinks, hurts my eyes when it washes off my face, and it's expensive."
4,This game is CA-RA-ZZZYYYY,"This game is sweet. Its also the first tony hawk that you can walk around in and this one also has a story of you going from punk to pro. You can customize your skater from head to toe, you can even make your own board! Man wait until you get this game its great!!!"
4,The Best Hawk game yet.,"This game is brilliant and very fun (and addicting). I went and rented this game and played it for hours. This is definitley the best Tony Hawk game by far. Instead of just skating, you can walk around, climb, drive cars and tons of other stuff. And you can create skaters a lot better than you can than in the other THPS games. You can also make tricks and skateparks. This game has it all. The Gamecube version may not have online gameplay but it still has great graphics and gameplay and it's fun. The only thing I didn't like about this game was that it was kind of easy. If you play it on sick then it's pretty hard, so when you play it, play sick for a better and more challenging gaming experience. And the music in this game is pretty cool too. I hope to see more Tony Hawk games in the future and I hope they're longer, funner and harder. Still a great game. Check it out. The Birdman rules!"
5,Good Shocks for price,"After 156K miles my shocks on my 2001 silverado were pretty worn and bad, replaced with these night and day difference. Good shocks for the price, and with lifetime warranty hard not too."
4,Get some...,"Early, raw, and mostly live. More akin to late-Rollins-punk than the harder metal signature that epitomized his style through the 1990s."
4,Midge Ure - Answers To Nothing,Midge's second album. Very melodic. Released after leaving Ultravox and divorcing his wife. the title track is quite innovative with the drum solo and the softness of the singing. This CD has many highlights and few troughs. You will not be disappointed.
3,"So, Uh, What Happened? Shhhh....It's a ""Secret""!","The ""Secret War"" is so secret that not even the reader is witness to it. We're told about a massive war between a clandestine group of heroes and the Latverians--a war that we never actually see. In the afterword by Brian Michael Bendis, Bendis states, ""What was their mission? Did they succeed or fail?"" The war eventually moves to U.S. soil, where ""sleeper cells"" of villains are activated in an attempt to destroy New York City. This was one of Marvel's first attempts to bring the Marvel Universe into the ""real world,"" and as such it's only a moderate success. The art, by Gabriele Dell'Otto, is amazing."
3,More like 3.5 stars,"I agree with other reviewers. This is a great story concept, but wasn't executed to its full potential. It feels like a short story, when it should have been at least twice as long. Maybe in a couple of decades somebody will do to this what was done to Squadron Supreme and make it better. The interaction and dialogue between people/heroes is great (the usual from Bendis) but seeing more would have been better.The non-graphic pages (SHIELD interviews, bio pages) were really well done and are interesting, but are not a substitute for a story that's too short. In addition, the art really shined, and certainly helped the flaws."
5,Pretty!,I bought this as a graduation present for my step daughter who is graduating from 6th grade. I ordered something else as a back up because on the website this did not look very pretty. I was very pleased to find that it arrived in very nice packaging and the bracelet itself is alot nicer than its picture. Don't hesitate to order for that special little girl in your life!
5,bracelet,"I bought this for my dauughter for a small graduation gift. It was also her birthstone, so how lucky is that. She loved it, and that;s all that matters to me."
4,Yoga and a great senior sleuth,"Kate Kennedy attends a dinner for Swami Schwartz, founder of the Palmetto Beach Yoga Institute. Swami drops dead because someone spiked his double espresso with cyanide.Kate is recently widowed and fairly new to retirement in South Florida. Her ex-sister-in-law Marlene lives in the same condo building. The two of them decide to try to figure out why he was poisoned.Their investigation leads them to a cryogenics firm where you can have your head frozen for $30,000 or your whole body for $128,000.There is a plethora of suspects. Can they figure out who did it and why without putting themselves in danger?I really enjoy this series. I think Kate is a fun senior sleuth. The escapades that she and Marlene get into are very entertaining. It is a fun, fast read! A great cozy mystery.For those of you who might not know, she has also written the Ghostwriter series as Noreen Wald. They're great fun too!I highly recommend this book!Please check out www.mysteryloverscorner.com"
5,A Bargain for Students,"I am teaching ""Henry V"" in college composition courses this semester, and found this version of the play is perfect for student readers on a budget. The text is all there and available as a free download. I have students reading the play on their Kindle Reader, on their phones, and on their laptop computers. It works well for me."
5,shoufy the cat,What a great book for children. Nicely illustrated and a pleasure to read. This is a must read for young children and even adults who have a fondness for cats. Great job Sharon!!!!!!! ...
4,"Looks great, but it's difficult to tell which piece is which","The pieces look great, and it is a lot of fun, but it does become difficult to tell which pieces are which when actually playing chess. Bart is the Bishop, but he is holding a sword and shield, which makes me want to think he is the Knight (Krusty the Klown is the Knight).My board also came with 7 pawns on one side, and 3 Bishops (the other side had the usual 8 pawns and 2 Bishops), which is mildly annoying.Other than that, the set is well made (the pieces are sturdy, the case is metal, and the board, although its only made of cardboard, comes printed with a background of various Simpsons' characters).As watching The Simpsons and playing Chess are two of my favorite activities, this set was a ""must have"" for me. I don't play on it much, but I am glad I got it, as it looks cool!"
1,Totally useless ... I don't understand the great reviews?,"I was a huge fan of the movie Forks over Knives. Aside from the fact that this guy follows a plant based diet, this is by no means an add-on to the movie. For starters, the fireman is hardly well spoken - the whole presentation is like a home video. He shows 2 families who have made the decision to do a plant based diet - each of them cooks 3 recipes. They also go shopping and he points out a few tidbits about how to read labels ... nothing about how the family progressed. He literally spends one day with each family and that's that. I completely support their ideas, but this was a useless production ... its not inspiring, and frankly doesn't teach you anything. But I highly recommend the movie Knives over Forks! Fat, Sick and Nearly dead is also a great watch ..."
3,Wanted follow-up,I liked that it showed Rip with 2 different families however I would like to have seen how the family did a few months down the line. I did enjoy the recipes he showed the family. This gave me new choices for myself and ideas for ways to eat a plant based diet.
1,not so great,"First, it doesn't work with all needles and it doesn't work with mine (CVS brand). There's a list of needles it won't work with on the manufacturer site, but that's not included in the Amazon listing. Also, ""one button use"" is misleading--one button pushes the needle through the skin, but you still have to depress the needle plunger, so this actually makes the process more complicated rather than simpler. It's going back."
5,excellent,"This gadget is the best---I can't inject my insulin without. I've used one for twenty years. Makes being a diabetic easier! Could not find in our local drugstors, so went to AMAZON!"
4,Florsheim review,"The price is really low for this shoe. The only problem being that this was probably in storage for a long time. The leather was pretty stiff. I like the show, but it will take a while to loosen up."
4,Good value for money,This is a very good buy for starters.It has good manification. Sometimes teh pictue is not stable as your hands are a bit shaky. Otherwise they are very good general purpose binoculars.Solves the basic purpose. You can enjoy the scenes with these.
1,couldn't get into it,I started this book three or four times. It didn'thold my interest. I've tried going back to it but again I can't get into it.
2,Dumb spoof,"Like all dumb spoofs, this one isn't really that funny. It's a play on Bond but kind of a 1970 spoof instead of a modern spoof. It certainly has a wonderful view of Rio but that's about it."
5,"10,000% dynamite","100% pure poison is classic chicagoan soul at its very finest. it's extremely difficult to find any faults with this album... which has **finally** been released onto cd. fans of mandrill and roy ayers will definitely dig on this. ""windy c"" and ""puppet on a chain"" stand out as especially fawnky. check it out."
5,Gripping as always!,"This book is chock-full of action and never stops to rest. K. A. Applegate has written many Animorph titles and this one seems to be above as some others are as well. It's a must read- it's from Cassie's point of view and is going into the free- Hork- Bajir issue and of course, a prophecy."
2,Does a fair job as an introduction but I will be selling my copy,I bought this textbook as it was required for one of my courses. I would not consider using any of the advice offered in practice - the book is outdated and very far removed from the reality of software development processes today. Consider picking up a book on the Unified Process or one of the many books on agile methods instead.
2,Since its cheap I guess you can't lose too much,"But the book really was only marginally useful. It was written as a textbook but I don't really think that it gave a good understanding of Systems Analysis and Design, except for small systems design."
4,Make sure you check fitment,"I bought these because i had searched for REAR shocks, these are for the FRONT shocks, i imagine they would work on the rears if they had the proper mounting bracker, but they dont, they also seem to be shorteranyways, since the sellers wont list these as front or rear shocks, just be careful to check in the lists of ""vehicles this product fits"" and make sure your getting the right itemi was planning on doing my fronts anyways, but now i gotta order the rears, oh well"
1,Tales told by a fruit-loop,"<sigh> Here we go again ..More than 90% of people think David Fraudster Icke's books are revealing and truthful. How sad. How very very sad. You people are seriously ill if you believe this noted con artist and deceiver is revealing anything other than misdirection and bulldust.Then again, given how conditioned, programmed and brainwashed society is today people will easily fall for any kook who says something they ""feel"" is right. No questions asked, Three bags full.Stay away from this book if you value your sanity. Then again, since most people are braindead already it won't matter much and will just be IcKEing on the cake. hehehe"
4,"Awsome toy, addictive game!","My left arm's paralyzed due to a massive brain aneurysm, and this game's perfect for one handed use, I find it beneficial in thumb/eye coordination and highly recommend it for anyone. Radica has done an exceptional job in pocket Tetris' making. I've had the game for about three (3) years and have played it hard for that time, it's just now starting to show wear. Great gift or anything, at an affordable price. I gave it 4 stars for everything it asked because, nothing is absolute."
3,Subpar,"I think this is a weak version of what could have been great. I like the format of it, but I think 1/2 of each episode could have been edited. It just seems slow and bloated."
5,Wonderful,Check it out. Really interesting documentary. Looks at the ordinary lives of navy personnel on an aircraft carrier at war.
2,Hysterical extrapolation,"I am profoundly sympathetic to the main thesis of this book -- that the present American economic and political situation is marching towards a fascist system. However, this alleged 'writer' relies too much upon mere juxtaposition and unsubstantiated conjecture to label anyone and everyone whoever enjoyed power in the U.S. to be a ""fascist."" The book has much in the way of interesting information, but the conclusions come across as the colloquial ramblings of an undisciplined conspiracy theorist."
1,A Product Of Acute Paranoia,"I more than anyone want to believe that America, despite all appearances, is in fact a fascist police state, but this book does not convince me. The only thing it does convince me of is the Left's willingness to distort the truth in order to justify their political ideology, a failing equally apparent among the Right. If you are not a hardcore communist, you will find this book laughable."
1,Um .... What??,"Based on the cover, I thought this looked like a cute book. Boy, was I wrong.Aside from the horrible grammar (which I could have gotten past), and pretty lame story line, the book makes light of the animals (in theory) getting wasted on their cruise ships. The cats were ""crazy"" on catnip and there were ""milk"" bottles strewn about the ship (bottles that definitely resembled beer bottles, not milk bottles). I can see this being funny for an adult to flip through, but I personally found it inappropriate for my 5 year old. Sure, the art is good. But good art doesn't make a good children's book."
4,Everpure H-300 replacement cartridge,"The product works fine.However, I find it extremely difficult to remove the old cartridgeand even more difficult to install the new cartridge."
2,not enough to filter out limescale,"If you live in a city with very hard water, this won't be enough to filter out the lime.To test calcium carbonate filtering ability, pour a little of this everpure water into a pot, and let it evaporate over the stove.You will see white deposits left on your pot.Bottom line- this is not a good substitute for commercial quality water vending machines. At 25 cents a bottle, vending machines are still cheaper, and cleaner."
1,"Total rip-off, and defective","Bought this filter march 2011 as a replacement for our under-sink water filtration system. What a dud! The supposedly filtered water was GRAY and tasted foul - like old metal. I returned the filter immediately. Turns out this filter was dated ""2008"", and they are supposedly only good for one year. So - do the math. Never again."
1,Everpure EV9270-71 H-300,"I've been using this product for 15 years. It's been satisfactory all these years. However, I've found out the last one i purchased from Amazon has a minor leak. I believe it's been leaking since I installed it in Feb. 2010 and did not realize until I open the under sink door last week."
1,this book sucks bigtime,"I'm 28, a musician, and a big fan of Deep Purple (especially the mark 2 era). I was very excited to read this book before it came in the mail. I read some of the reviews on it here....some of them were negative, but I wanted to see for myself. Well, the truth is...it sucks. Why? Because it is written like a scientific report in a college journal. No one in thier right mind would ever want to read garbage like this. This is a book that you can only read a chapter of before you throw it down in disgust. I'm being extreme, but this is an extreme matter. I was on a tour bus and this is the only book I had! I was forced to try to read some of it. There is some great info in it, but you have to sort through so much other stuff that's its not even worth reading. Maybe one day someone will write a real book on these classic unsung heroes if 70s rock.Rob ParkerMemphis, TN10/25/04"
3,It was a little disappointing,"The lock is kind of cheap. In fact, the binding is not the best quality either.I broke the lock off and use a cord to tie it shut. I love the quotes, and the overall style of the book. Just the right size to fit in my bag, and the cover is quite elegant. I scratched off the ""title"" on the spine (it says ""Desire - A Private Journal) So if you're trying to keep it private, I suggest taking that off. :-) If you take care of this book, it will likely become a good friend."
3,Pretty but a little much at times,"This journal is definetly well made, but at times I found the quotes to be a little more distracting and leading than inspiring. If you like to work off of quotes to get started writing than this is the one for you, if not look elsewhere."
2,Lock did not work! :(,I am really disappointed about this journal. I was so excited to get this because I have wanted one for so long. However the lock would not lock no matter how hard I tried and it does not close right without the lock. Had the lock worked it would had been perfect. Very bummed about this!
4,It's A Good Buy!!,"I have 3 of these journals, and I am now purchasing a 4th one. I love the journal with the exception that sometimes the lock doesn't work right. You can open it with or without the key....sometimes. I wish it had a better lock, but it is definitely a journal to buy. I does lock and the pages are so wonderfully smooth. My pen oftentimes tends to move faster than my thoughts can travel.If you are a private person, with many personal thoughts and experiences....this is the journal for you. You may still need to put it up to keep from the wrong hands, but I would highly recommend this journal. I helps me free my thoughts!!!"
5,"A definite ""must have"" for any woman!","To say a book full of blank pages can invoke wild sensuous images and feelings in an understatement. I felt an exhilarating energy from the moment I started to write in this journal. With erotic quotes and drawings adorning the edge of the pages, Desire will bring out some of your most hidden and secret emotions that you never knew existed. Complete with a lockable cover you will especially love the keys that are attached to the back in a small burgundy envelope, complete with a red wax seal. Whether you're a hopeless romantic or jotting down your weekly exploits, Desire is a definite ""must have"" for any woman."
4,Perfect,This is a hard item to find in most stores and i found it easily here. Nice case it works great for a dewalt hammerdrill.
3,Good buy,"I bought this to wear under seethrough skirts and shirts, and it works terrific for that purpose! It does slip up like 4in when I sit or climb stairs but the body curves keep it in good place, so it's not like it slips and everyone can see everything! But I do go to the bathroom to pull it back down every couple of hours just in case. I wear it with the straps so I don't know if it slips down from the bust. If you're looking for a corset-type effect this is not the thing for you. While it's very tight and form-fitting and keeps everything in place, it doesn't really shrink the stomach. The fabric is really good, but if you want a tummy tucker you probably need something with vertical wires around the waist.Side note, it has 3 hooks in the back for closing, and it is quite a struggle to hook it yourself, so get help, or skill."
1,Pretty (poor) in pink,"When we inititially opened the box the colors and decals looked as advertised. Once I took a closer look at the material itself it was obvious that this product was of low quality. Let me start with the wood or should I say ""pressed paper"", I could see where the drill holes were put in incorrectly and then repaired with a paper machete material and covered with a lot of paint. As i started assembly pieces started breaking off. I can honestly say that every component was repaired in some way and covered with extra paint. I guess I just expect more for a $100 these days. Great design, great colors but very poor quality. I really wanted to like this product..."
5,BEAUTIFUL CHAIR,Guidecraft Butterfly Rocking ChairBeautiful rocking chair and excellent quality. Would love to have all the guidecraft furniture for my grandchildren. I know my granddaughter will enjoy this chair for years to come.
2,Err....it's....ok....,"This has to be one of the most poorly done movies ever made, but surprisingly it's worth wasting an evening to sit down and make fun of it. It has no resemblance to any Lovecraft story, however, so in that respect it truly bites. The acting is horrible, so horrible that you hope that they weren't trying too hard."
1,plunger,The Acme plunger was sent to me with full knowlege that it had only a 50% chance of being the right length for my juicer. It was not the right length. So I'm supposed to pay your postage and wait for you to maybe fix this problem? I don't think so. Your rating is 0 stars. You knew fully well that the plunger for my juicer may no longer be manufactured.
1,wrong size plunger,"I have a ACME juicer model 5001 and the replacement plunger /Pusher they sent me is the wrong size, too long..WTF.."
4,Risk - LOTR Trilogy Edition,"Great game, seems a lot more complicated than original Risk with the bad guys having quite the advantage. Great map! There are no extra pieces."
4,really fun- but takes a long time,I really liked this game and i got it because i love LOTR. It takes a long time to play but if you can find someone patient enough to play it with you then it is a blast. It used a lot of stratigy and made me think.
5,Lord of the Rings Risk,This is the best game ever made! I f you liked Risk you will love Lord of the Rings Risk. Never heard of either? BUY IT! (...)
2,MANY OTHER DVDs OUT THERE THAT ARE BETTER,The info was good but the presentation poor. Looks like an old style home made video.
2,"entertaining, but poorly researched","I got this as a gift, and since I had nothing else to read, picked it up. It has an entertaining plot, which did keep me reading, and overall it is fine if you're just looking for some entertainment.However, there were so many small problems--I wondered that at editor didn't catch the glaring anachronisms, and other oddities. Then when I saw the author was a former reporter, I thought, really? Didn't she know better? Just a little research would have caught some of the problems with plane travel, with film and camera references, etc. And the use of British slang in 1922 Berlin was just dumb.Really sloppy in these terms, which was annoying, and hurt what could otherwise be a competently done thriller."
4,Made Me Stay Up Late...,"I've only started reading Ariana Franklin's work in the last week, but in that space of time I've read three of the four books of hers in the local library system. I've found them to all be very interesting & enjoyable. Perhaps I don't know enough about the specific history of the time period of this book--post WWI Berlin--to quibble w/all of the details that other reviewers have remarked upon, although I've read a good bit of history of that time period & a variety of books on the Romanovs. In any case, the story seems plausible to me--as plausible as the actual story of Anna Anderson--I found the characters to be more than one-dimensional, & I did not see the twist at the end at all. For those reviewers unhappy w/the use of British slang, perhaps if one thinks of the book as a translation from German, it would be easier to simply enjoy the story for what it is."
5,Suspenceful book.,"A very good book. I would recommend this to anyone who likes historical fiction. I have loved this author's other books, too."
5,historical mystery,"I read this book while on a vacation that took me to Berlin and east--territory this book covers--,producing many resonances. The story takes place over the period from the early 1920s to early 1930s, making vivid the hyperinflation and economic hardship in Germany that led to the rise of Hitler and the horrors he brought with him. The question of a real or phony Anastasia figures prominently. Interesting characters. A good read."
5,Very nice,These are very nice and my husband loves the weight of these....Much easier to handle than toothpicks or plastic picks.
2,dim watted idea,"Two things. First the oem package had been sliced open along the seam of the container and one bulb was rolling around inside the shipping box.Second, the bulbs are not brighter and do not reach further down the road. They are only whiter. So save your money unless you have to have white."
1,My fault...I picked it up based on the actress...,"I only picked this one up because it had Lauren Graham in it. I had never heard of this movie, but thought ""What the heck, with Lauren Graham, how bad could it be?"" Oh my god! It was worse than one could imagine. What were they thinking? I agree with other reviewers....How did this guy have 12 previous girlfriends? Be kind to your brain cells...skip this one."
4,Almost the best of Johnny Cash,"This is a must-have CD for Johnny Cash fans--there are a few of his best not on the album, though, but otherwise very good!"
4,"Good Fun, Good Laughs, Educational","I read a lot of the reviews here before purchasing this product. Yeah, there's a lot of potty humor. You do lots of off the wall stuff (I had to smell my husband's armpit - I do that every night when I tuck into bed, though not purposely.) It's a funny, silly game that is probably best played with family members or very close family friends. There's covert educating going on but it's nicely disguised as entertaining, funny, and disgusting. If you're averse to discussing natural body functions in front of other people - this isn't the game for you. If you have a child that is into science and how the body works and is a bit ornery - you'll be re-educated and your child will be rolling on the floor. My son, who is 7, thought it was a hugely funny game. He even seemed interested in the ""boring facts"" that weren't related to body functions. It's a good chance to laugh with your children - and that in itself is pretty valuable!"
4,so-so,"This Product was good! It lasted for a few months before the goo dried out, but the game is very fun. I recomend this game for ages 7-11."
5,They have only gotten better the 3rd time around,"If you thought the first two were good, CMG 3 is faster harder and will have you on the edge of your seat through out the entire flick. It will have you screaming NO-WAY over and over again. A must in your collection of Hardcore vidoes."
4,Need 6-10 on Kindle!,Great series if you're looking for light sci-fi with a lot of humor in the form of a sarcastic parody of our society. But why would only the first 5 books be available on Kindle? We need the rest of the series!
4,Rise with the phoenix...,"Nyle is 13 when an accident at the nuclear power plant changes her life. Living with her grandmother, she is forced/destined to help out a mother and son exposed to the radiation at the nuclear power plant. Ezra, the son, had the greater exposure and is extremely sick. This is how Nyle overcomes her own fears to come out and help Ezra, and be helped in return.The book is touching, though short. It is a definite read because afterwards...it will leave you wondering, and maybe a bit somber."
5,Phoenix Rising is uplifting,After a nuclear spill evacuees are sent to Nyle's farm in Vermont where she lives with her grandmother. The main character of the story keeps Ezra and his mother at a distance until she learns to trust them and like them. She understands the importance of friendship after getting to know them. Best part of the book is in the middle when the two teenagers are talking about heros. It proves the point that there are everyday heros. I loved the book because it was very moving.
5,2 THUMBS UP!!!!!!!!!!,"NYLE'S TRAGEDY IS SO REAL THAT I CRIED. (A LOT!!!!) HOWEVER, SHE SHOWS US THAT LIFE DOES GO ON. KEEP ON WRITING 'EM AUNT KAREN!!!!!!"

4,"Works for me, could use locking system","I looked for a carrier for a rowing shell that would fit my SUV (a bit tall) and would allow me to load the shell singlehanded. Most of the conventional rack systems for rowing shells hold the hull well above the rack crossbars and that makes for difficult single handed loading.The Slipstream allows for a lower loading height and the combination of the sliding (to the rear) frame and the rear roller make it easy to get the boat started with little chance of hitting the roof with the hull.My only complaint is that there is no simple locking mechanism for the rack system. Thule suggests using a cable and lock, but I would much prefer locking fasteners such as are available with Yakima and other Thule racks."
2,Sunset goes Windows 3.1,"This is a reference guide for the novice gardener and a little computer savy is helpful.The install program will NOT allow any more than 8 characters in the folder name. Don't bother with the software's installation process and just copy the cd to a folder of your choice. Then you can name the folder what you want.Disregard the message that says the system is not set to 256 colors if you're running SVGA. My suggestion is to stick to the paperback or hard cover until Sunset updates its 1995 CD-ROM to be compatible with today's computers.The reference guide contains a database of 1,100 genera and 600 species. The index list is helpful. You are able to search by Lation and/or common names of the plant. Plant descriptions are brief. Click on the pronunciation button and hear how to say the plant's Latin name."
3,AMAZON with CINGULAR a nightmare,"Thers no doubt the TREO 600 is an outstanding PDA phone, probably the best. Having migrated from the TREO300 on sprint its lightyears ahead. It should have had a higher res screen, it should have had bluetooth (we'll see both of these simple improvements in the next version) Pricing is ridiculous. I chose Cinglar as the rebate on amazon brought the phone to an OK $299, and given well see a newer phone soon not bad. However HUGE issues with the CINGULAR/AMAZON system - 10 days not resolved. The head & tail dont know what each other is doing (long story - probably more cingular & the AT&T acquisition). Anyway go TREO 600 if you cant wait for next the next model. GO VERIZON as has best coverage and skip AMAZON as they cant supply the phone any cheaper than the cellular store.."
4,A Fanatic,"My sister doesn't like to read much. But one day I left this book (thank God, just finishing it) at her house. Well, she grabed it, read it, and called me: ""hey, why you'd never told me how fascinating is to read this woman named Katherine?"" I asked her: Ah....this is not her best book...was his first, it was updated during the 90's....but it was written in the 80's. -""You are kidding me"". Click.Since then, she became a fanatic.I wont tell you my phone number, but I am sure, that if you read this book, you'll like to call and say: ""Hey...thanks""."
2,Give Me A Break,"This book is even worse than The Eight, which at least had a very interesting plot, plot devices and a host of fun historical characters. This one has a terrible plot and awful characters (actually they are the same ones as in The Eight but with different names). I can't believe Ms. Neville used to work in a bank, her plot device is so incredibly hokey its hard to believe there can be any element of truth or realism in any part of this book."
4,"Fast paced, spend-the-day-in-bed-reading kind of book! Fun.","A Calculated Risk seemed to be a faster, less complicated version of Katherine Neville's fabulous book, The Eight. (One of my top five favorite books ever!) The Eight made me pick up history books to learn more . . . A Calculated Risk ended with the book. It was an easy, entertaining read. Great book to spend a lazy day with or entertain yourself with on a trip."
4,great book of a not so great man's army,"Though I do certainly agree with the other reviews of this book I still believe it has its virtues in detailing the mighty Prussian army in its organization, in its recruiting and its battles.The author provides not so flattering insights into the man who headed it, lead it into battle and came pretty close to being the cause of its destruction. Like Napoleon, he must rank as a great tactician but also a Butcher in regards to the men under his command."
5,Essential Photoshop Guide,"Killer Photoshop book! Even though it ""only"" covers Photoshop 3. If you're a ""normal"" working photographer or designer chances are you don't use 90% of the stuff you read about in the ""Photoshop Bible"" all the time. What you really use is levels, curves and the Info box. ""Professional Photoshop"" concentrates on those areas and really helps you understand what you're doing, and why!! I'd give it a ""10"" if it was upgraded to PS 4!"
2,Not for those workinh in RGB,I purchased this book based on the online reccomendations of others. I was shocked to learn that the entire focus of the book is on CMYK color and not RGB! (I only work in RGB as do many others.) This was rather misleading to say the least. I urge those of you who DO work in RGB to pass on this book. It is strictly designed for CMYK. Howard
5,Great guide to an over looked area,"This book is somewhat dated, but most of the Trans-Pecos Geology has not changed in long while. I originaly picked this book up while I was looking for places to rock climb. I ended up doing a lot of agate and fossil huntig on some of my climbing trips. Informative and relevant book over a geologicaly diverse area of Texas."
3,"Very, Very small!!","I received this item very quickly and it did come in a very nice box with a poem. Unfortunately, the bracelet is so small that it can't possibly fit any adult's wrist. I am very thin and it wouldn't even fit on me. I plan on having my mom use it as a keychain. I read how a couple of other reviews said it was small but I thought maybe it was just small for those particular people. I wish there would have been dimensions listed in the review because then I wouldn't have bought it. It is very pretty but I am extremely disappointed that it is so small and don't feel like going through the hassle of sending it back. Trust me, it is SMALL!!"
4,"Stylus fit my old portable record player - kids are happy with their new, old toy","I needed a replacement stylus for an old ""suitcase"" type record player for my nephews & nieces. This fit the bill and works well. The kids get a kick out of our old 45s and read-along story & record books.Another generation gets to experience vinyl & build childhood memories too."
1,Advised against.,"I wouldn't call this book biography. It's more a sort of ""imaginative memoir""; where the author `recreates' his subject's life (including being privy to his thoughts and emotional states) as a way of padding out his meagre research. It's also marked by glib generalizations, facile writing, and persistent illiteracy. Save your money."
1,Awful!,First; it's not an official release! Second; the picture looks like VHS rip. Third; the sound is distorted! Don't buy this!
1,This game sucks!,"This is the worst game I have ever played. It was so bad that we didn't even finish. It came down to just guessing and could have gone on all night without a clear winner. This game sucks! I wouldn't buy this game with somebody elses money, even if it were only $1."
3,Boring!,"This game had good questions, but that was all. It was a very slow game and we decided to just ask the questions on the cards and forget about the little chips. I played the game twice the whole time that I have had it, and that has been for a couple years now. It is not worth the money at all. I have even tried to give this game away and nobody will take it. I will eventually give it to Good Will."
5,Kora Magic!,"Kora music is a genre which i really enjoy and who better to listen than the J.J.Cale of Mali (If Farka Toure can be the Muddy Waters of Mali) Toumani Diabate'. Chancing upon this disc which combines the traditional music of Mali , played on the Kora with elements of Jazz/ Blues, i had high expectations for this one. I was not let down. This music represents some of the most delightful sounds on the planet. There's a liveliness and joyousness, that keeps you mesmerized.If you have never heard of Kora music, you must listen to this one, you owe it to your yourself, the only thing i can think of that is better than listening to this CD, is seeing the man play this live. Its incredible, soothing, clear blue skies music, a time in your life when life was much much better and happy.recommend strongly. 5 Stars"
5,A must for musical theatre lovers,"Unlike many recent books on musicals, the reader doesn't have to sift through mounds of errors to get information. Mr. Miller has done a stunning job of breaking apart the musicals he's chosen as examples. His chapters on Camelot and Music Man alone could provide a semester's work for any college course on musical theatre. One of the most useful parts of his deconstructions is his explaining how the music--whether underscoring or song--supports the story and aids the audience's understanding of what they're seeing. As someone who has performed in or directed musicals for over 30 years, I cannot recommend this book highly enough."
1,awful,"go for a tarot deck from Lo Scarabeo or US Games. this edition is soooooo poor, the paper is awful and cheap."
4,Holds surprising amount,"I've had this product for a few months now, and haven't filled it yet- and most of what I carry on it involves powerpoint presentations with many photos. I'm even buying a second one as a Christmas gift.My only complaint is the loop attachment- I had it on my key chain, and the loop snapped off (its only plastic); I bought a carrying case for it at Target, but that was annoying (and potentially disaster, if I had lost it).Otherwise, its been a great product that has worked as advertised."
4,The Ride You Can't Resist,"""Antioxidants"" was a compelling surprise. To create truly human characters is daunting. To place them in story circumstances that grab a reader and won't let go--that's something to write home about. This skill is Terry Bennett's in abundance.He builds tension like author Nelson DeMille, and honor and integrity like Robert B. Parker. He pulls you into the pages of ""Lesson Plan"" face to face with a man who has messed up his life almost willfully, yet you can't help but wish him well, and you will remain locked in step with him through the story, utterly convicted that nothing bad can happen, evidence to the contrary notwithstanding. In ""Antioxidants,"" he again pulls you into the eye of the storm, with concise precision, and holds you there.It's like trying to keep from getting on that carnival ride that you swore last year, and every year, you'd never ride again. I may not have liked some endings, but I will read the stories again and again. I won't be able to resist."
5,Loved it!,"Already seen the series and loved it so much that I just HAD to own it. This was at an incredibly reasonable price for a good-quality complete set! Everything's great, ensured by a shrink-wrap n' everything! Started watching it with my roommate, and so far we're loving it!"
5,Most used cookbook in the house,"In our home, this is lovingly known as ""the green-checkered cookbook."" It is the preferred cookbook of the two kids and two adults doing all the cooking here. Everything we've ever tried has been tasty and excellent and, if 14-year-olds have no trouble using it, you know that its directions are clear and easy to follow. Don't know how anyone could rate it for less than 5 stars."
2,Not worth the $$,"Quality of the item was poor. Door faces hang crooked and drawers don't slide well. Several boards were also damaged upon receipt. I would return it, but the cost of shipping now that it's put together would eat up most of the refund. This is why I don't shop online for items of this nature often."
2,poor adjustments,"The zipper failed after two weeks of use. The velcro straps don't offer enough adjustment.The vest needs to be in contact with the body in order to transfer coolness to the wearer, and the vest cannot be tightened enough for smaller or even average-sized humanoids."
1,I regret my purchase Chalean.,"1 star is rather generous. This is a $130.00, zero star purchase. Nobody appreciates receiving incomplete orders.1) No handles for the elastic rope. That's nice, so I guess I can't use it.2) One DVD missing from the box: (Get Lean Intervals). Thanks again.I will seriously reconsider any future DVD type purchases from Amazon. This is the second time I have received an incomplete DVD purchase through Amazon.If you can not include a complete product, then don't advertise the items that you can not deliver.Annoyed and disappointed."
4,It's all about strength training,"First time Amazon reviewer.. I felt compelled to add my two cents . I have been using the push month circuits which for the first time in my life has really pushed me to use heavier weights. I exercise regularly with cardio and strength training in the past. With these routines, my arms are more shapely and I feel stronger when I do push ups. Having said that I haven't been following the full program exactly. So I cant say I am in my best shape yet. Just the 30 minutes push circuits (month 2) are worth the money.."
3,This will definitely take some getting used to :(,"I am a person who LOVES to workout, but after doing the first session I don't even feel mild affection for this. It is unorganized... everybody is doing something different and it throws me completely off. The camera does not stay on one exerciser long enough to focus and learn the move. Usually when a workout has different fitness levels they stay focused on the group so you can follow your level... but this just skips all over the place. It's like a really bad gym class. No one keeps count... there is no cadence, and the music... totally uninspiring. I gave it three stars because hopefully it will get better. After spending so much money on it I can't just let it end up a shelf sitter."
3,Not the results I'd hoped for,"I am in reasonably good shape and while my diet isn't perfect, I eat healthy most of the time. I was already exercising (running, etc) about 4-5X a week when I started the program. I hoped that it would help me to tone up and lose some of the weight I gained over the winter (overall I would like to lose about 15 lbs).I have just started the second week of the final phase (Lean Phase). While I have definitely toned up somewhat, I haven't lost any weight at all - in fact I gained a pound. I feel stronger but since my primary goal was weight loss, I am disappointed. I think at this point I may have to throw in the towel on this and try something else."
3,'I Don't Care',"This CD is definitely a ninja-only single. If you don't like I.C.P., you problably won't like this song or the comic book much less. This is more of a Zug Izland(Psychopathic Records' alternative group) type of song, complete with guitar riffs and strange vocals featuring Twiztid. Technically, this is a Dark Lotus song, back when it was just I.C.P. and Twiztid(I believe this followed Echo Side). A video, of sorts, was also put out on one of Psychopathic's J.C.W. DVD releases.I like this song but its not one of my favorites. All the big-time Psychopathic fans will problably want this one, but I'm sure alot of ninjas agree with me, this is not for anybody just getting introduced to I.C.P."
4,Not appalling,"I was appalled by the the first review of this book. Love for Sale is a truly enjoyable book with a wonderful sense of period. I do agree that this not this neither the best of the series or the genre, but that doesn't mean it isn't a worthwhile read. If you're after a laugh out loud cozy, try Carola Dunn's Daisy Dalrymples, but if you want an amusing Depression era mytery, these are the way to go."
3,Mediocre at best,"This latest Grace and Favor mystery is just plain mediocre. It wasn't terrible, and I did finish it, but I cared fairly little about whodunnit or why.Churchill has a number of very likeable characters in her Depression books, but she doesn't spend enough time with any given one of them for you to think of them as a friend. In the Jane Jeffry books, nearly everything is from Jane's point of view. She's your pal in the book and carries you along. Here we spend a little time with Lily, some time with the the police chief, some time with the pretty abandoned wife... it's hard to care much about any of them. The fact that the main mystery is solved by accident and a minor one is totally left hanging in midair is quite disappointing. The whole book feels low on energy."
3,One pan missing,"What I received is fine, but the box contained only 1 of the large pans, not two as described. I'm not sending it all back, though. I'll just use what was sent, and try to find the second large pan elsewhere. I gave only 3 stars because the order was not complete."
2,RANGE KLEEN DRIP PANS AND TRIM RINGS,"The fit and overall quality is O.K. unfortunately myD-901 ""8 piece set"" is in reality a ""6 piece set"".Both of the small drip pans are missing.I think the problem is that the box these things are sold inhas a viewing hole in the front that's just big enough that thesmall pieces can weasel their way out while being thrown aroundin their travels. They need better packaging.Sigh. It's not worth the trouble to return them.However, I am not amused."
5,This is GREAT!!!!!!!!,"This game is great! I got into playing it a few days ago and it is so much fun. In the game you go through phases such as the Skirmish phase, the Fellowship phase and more. You'll find out who the true Lord of the rings is!You can improve your deck with more decks or booster pack from these expansions:Felloship of the ringAragorn deck Gandalf deckMines of moriaGimli deck Gandalf deckRealms of the elf lordsLegolas deck Boromir deckFor further info, visit Decipher.comThe two towersAragorn deck theoden deckAnd also visit anysraze.comto buy decks, boosters and singlesof your favorite character. battle of helms deepEowyn deck Legolas deckPlease Note: All decks come witha rulebook"
1,Useless waste,"As a glass cleaner, this product leaves a residue.As a rain repellent, I'd give it a 2 out of 10.Don't bother.Stick to Windex and original rain-x."
2,Cleans Windows but Does Not Repell Rain,"It cleaned my windows fairly well and didn't leave any streaks or smears. However, it did nothing to repel the water like in the picture on the back of the bottle."
3,"Ok, but would not buy again","I'm 5'8, 150 lbs, 32 waist. The Hip Belt had to be tighten all the way. The bag sways from side to side no matter how tight you make it. The draw strings are all way too long. Overall, ok bag but way too many flaws that I would not buy again."
4,"Bahco North 10-24-51 Ergo Grip Bow Saw 24""","Saw is as advertised and anticipated. Solid frame with comfortable handle. Have cut 4"" branches without any problems. Very satisfied with Bahco saw, especially when compared to another saw purchased from local big box supply store. Delivery was as advertised. Overall, very satisfied with order and delivery."
4,KMFDM is back to its old self,"although the gunter-schultz-style guitars are still missing, KMFDM is back. MDFMK, although pretty good, pales in comparsion to old KMFDM stuff, and the new KMFDM gives me new hope in the future of industrial music. Back In The USSA is a really energetic, (surprisingly) up-beat track with punk-style guitar riffs, and their cover of Boots is pretty damn cool, especially the 1st remix. i can't wait for ATTAK."
2,Boots,"""Boots"" is actually done rather well by Kmfdm. I just have a problem with the original song to begin with. Its annoying. And ""Back to the USSA"" is a cover to I think. Its nothing great. If you are a hardcore Kmfdm fan, then buy it like I did, just for the purpose of adding it to the collection. But really, its not that great of a single."
4,Great book but difficult to obtain ingredients if not in the USA,"I love this book and the recipes, however I had to go as far to grow my own chillies to utilise this book. I did try to make them with normal 'green', 'red' and birds eye chillies from the local grocers however the subtleties in heat and taste of the authentic recipes is sorely lacking.So if you have access to at least 15 different chillies you should be right, even some of the more familiar ones like anchos or new mexicos you should be fine, but if not you are depriving yourself of a truely unique food experience. Cintains all of the typical southwest dishes and a few I have not seen before, a book sure to please those familiar and new to southwest cooking."
1,Jivago lotion,"I have been using Jivago for over 10 years. Don't know what I would wear otherwise. I have ordered several times from Amazon and been very satisfied. However, I ordered 3 of these lotion and to my surprise they are watery! I was HAD!"
4,Cute toy. Lots of fun.,"My daughter loves this toy. It's a very clever idea. It is a little heavy for the size and the middle is hard due to the electronic box. Not a toy for a ""lovey"" to cuddle with, but it's a ton of fun to play with. Both my 3 year old and my 1 year old have a ball with him. They especially love the song he sings. I really like that he says more than one thing and the things he says seem to be a little random which is fun for them. Good purchase. I would do it again easily."
3,good for kids or pop music,Average quality sound; stand for iPod doesn't work welll. You get what you paid for... don't expect bring the house down but not a bad product for kids
2,Looks and sound crappy cheap,"I bought these speakers because they were cheap and I needed asap. Well, you get what you pay for. The sound is barely audible on the loudest setting. My biggest problem with the speakers was the sound quality; it was pretty bad, it is horrible. It sounded as if I were using aWalkman, rather than aniPod. Also, they burn through your batteries very fast. The speakers I bought did not bring a power adapter and that was a BIG problem.Overall, the packaging and compactness is cool looking but it is not worth the $2. If they could just fix the sound quality it would be much better."
3,Portable Speakers,"They're real nice and convenient with great service; however, the quality was not as great as I had hoped"
3,Compact Speaker Review,The speakers are nice little units that are good for traveling with your iPod. I would recommend that you purchase the AC/DC adapter along with the speakers.
3,Does not include a wall charger,"I got this because it was small and portable but also had a ""power adapter"" which means you CAN plug it in if you spend $25 for a wall charger. I misread and thought it came with a cord, but it doesn't. So this is not really a $10 speaker but a $35 speaker."
3,PRO-POWER - Portable speakers,"I needed speakers for my ipod to enjoy my MP-3 music when in the car or to share it with others, but I did not want to pay an exorbitant amount. These speakers are just right for my needs."
3,No volume control???,These speakers are priced right. They are outdated but they work for what I need. They don't have volume control on the speaker. You need to use the volume on your IPOD. Not near as convenient but it does work
5,powerful little buggers,"I just got these speakers a little while ago, and I have yet to find fault with them. It took a minute to find the cord that goes to the headphone jack, and it's a bit annoying that it doesn't charge, but for the price, they're amazing. Get 'em!"
1,BOOOO!,These speakers blew up the first time I used them!!! Smoke came out of them. So all I can say is you get what you pay for.
3,Okay for a kid,This is product is better for a kid. It don't get very loud and when it does it doesn't sound good at all.
4,Powerful little speakers,"Was in the market for some speakers that were powerful but that can get tossed around. We took this suckers camping and on the beach. For the price we paid, we didn't have to worry about them getting messed up. It's great they fold up into a little square, protects itself when getting tossed around during camping/moving. Sometimes you have to play with your mp3/phone volume and the speaker volume to get the sound right. We bought 2. The only thing is, after a year of use, we put new batteries in, heard a loud POP!.. then hissing.. only to realize the batteries exploded. In not just one.. but BOTH of them (Batteries came from two different pacakges and different makers). Considering we used them both for a good year or so, we'd say they were still great purchases. But just be careful about the exploding batteries."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I was not expecting much from these speakers; but when I first used them while teaching a yoga class, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of sound. I spoke about them in the class too, that we shouldn't judge a book by it's cover or make snap judgments because we may miss out on something really great. These will work well until I can afford to purchase a portable player system - like a Bose, or such."
4,Great Value for intended use,"This speaker system is great for the use we intended. It has adequate sound, it recharges our ipod's and it is very portable. The small size and compact nature enabled us to take it on a cruise, plug it in and have our own selection of music and podcasts at any time. I recommend this item for anyone looking for a good solid speaker system. I would not use it for high quality sound needs such as dances etc."
1,Coby MP-C652 MP3 Player did not last 2 months,The Coby MP-C652 MP3 Player I bought failed within a month and Coby replaced it with a Coby MP-C654 MP3 Player. This MP3 player also failed within a month. Coby probably would have replaced that one too but I did not want to go through the effort. I bought a different brand that I am very happy with.
3,A Helpful book,"I was recommended this book by Sam Laing because he told me that many men often don't know who they are. This book was helpful to help me see my own and other's personality types. It helped me to see them, which was great to get out of it, but that's it. Reading the book, I wasn't blown away and he doesn't get real deep either. Later, though I feel like I know the temperaments pretty well.I recommend it for others, it's a good book. It has helped me deal with myself better and helped me see what the guys that I take care of need. And I think we will be closer because of it. I would like to see a disciple write a book about the four temperaments, though I think it's use can nullify the Bible. The Bible's all you need, but I guess like any other DPI book, it can help.Justin SeibelAtlanta Church of Christ"
4,The far end of the Far Side,"This is the very first collection of Larson's beloved Far Side cartoons. It's a small book, with just two of his early cartons per page, but they're good ones. All of them show Larson's inverted sense of reality. One shows a housewife on the phone, surrounded by fishbowls: ""Well that's how it happened Sylvia ... I kissed this frog, he turns into a prince, we get married, and wham! ... I'm stuck at home with a bunch of pollywogs."" Several others show an upset Santa Claus, his famous reindeer, and a mention of venison. Many show his fascination with improbable doings of wildlife. That earned him a place in the hearts of biologists everywhere, so much that a newly-discovered species was named in his honor.//wiredweird"
3,"good, early effort of Farside","this is a fair effort depicting 'Farside' in the early onset. later Gsry Larson really got creative and wild, that is the stuff i wanted."
5,Absolutely Wonderful!!!,"We have the other 3 (older versions) of Fireman Sam, and our 2 1/2 year old son loves them. So when we received this newer one we were a little afraid he wouldn't like it...boy were we wrong! He absolutely loves it!!! He watches it over and over and still laughs hysterically at the new & improved Norman Price. He will repeat the safety message in each story. Great fire safety video for children!"
4,GREAT ENTERTAINMENT FOR FUTURE FIREFIGHTER,"My 4 year old grandson LOVES Fireman Sam - he already said when he grows up he wants to be a firefighter - and I must admit, I enjoy watching Fireman Sam also."
4,Jack Kirby and Action Art,"This compendium has Kirby returning to Captain America without his long time collaborator, Stan Lee. Without Lee's control over the oft-enthusiastic Kirby, what comes out is a torrent of action and fast-paced plotting, unfettered by the more soap opera approach of Lee. Although very rough dialog sometimes inhibits the appreciation of the story, on balance, the reader is rewarded by non-stop action. It is a study in action art by the man who perfected action art, albeit the King is in the twilight of his career during this period."
4,Insanity at its Finest,"In 212 pages Drakulic takes us on a three month odyssey through the most intimate thoughts of Tereza, a foreign graduate student on a fellowship in New York City, about her relationship with her married lover, and fellow foreign student, Jose. Together the two create a bond of almost inescapable proportions - cemented in food, drink, sex, and their respective limitations with the English language. This detailed portrait of obsession and isolation is painted in such a way that the reader can almost empathize with Tereza's quest to possess Jose. Tereza justifies her actions so calmly and logically that you never doubt her sanity - even when she brings Jose's decomposing, frozen head to the airport and kisses his rotting lips before dumping it in a trash can. Sorry for the mini-spoiler, but this is insanity at its finest."
4,RosettaBooks into Film for Kindle,"Nothing wrong with the ""RosettaBooks into Film"" edition except maybe two or three typos that I noticed. This edition includes only the novella, which is 159 pages.As to the story, it is well written, exciting, and thought-provoking. It is also of some historical note, having greatly influenced Romero 's Night of the Living Dead. The story was first published in 1954."
3,Worth the price?,"My ""little golfer"" rec'd this for Christmas and loved it... until it broke. For the first 10 minutes it seemed to work properly. We were all extremely disappointed when the mechanism that rotates the holes in the center stopped rotating. The toy itself seemed too heavy for it. When upside down, it worked OK but turn it rightside again and no go. It totally died after the first day. If you're little one is into golf, it may be worth the six bucks to hit little putts. The golfers are cute and do actually swing at the balls. As for the fun of hitting it into the holes, forget it. Anyone over 5yo would be very disappointed."
1,Terribly uncomfortable shoes which keeping slipping off,"I always wear high heels to work( 2-3in heels)and usually have no problems but these are the most uncomfortable shoes I have ever worn. I even tried to break them in gradually by wearing them just a few hous a day. After a week, I gave up. I can't even return them since I wore them trying to break them in. And they keep slipping off my feet although they are not too big because they are so inflexible. Don't wast your money."
5,Invaluable Reference,"I took over a Novell network in my former position with absolutely NO knowledge of Novell other than the name. Needless to say I did an incredible amount of reading and time at the Novell Support site, but this book saved my life too many times to mention. Everything I needed for day to day operations of the network were only a few pages away. I can tell you it made me feel much more comfortable. If you administer a Novell network, this book is a must!"
1,Offenbabh:Tales of Hoffman by Placido Domingo,This cd is way over priced and the fact that it is only excerpts is not clearly stated.
1,what??,my scene's are going to be cancelled??? where'd you hear THAT?? *throws a party* now no more fighting lol BRATZ WILL RULE THE FASHION DOLL WORLD lol just playin. well they do rock ;-]
2,Very poorly mastered,"I bought this to enjoy DuPre's cello virtuosity, but all I can hear is the piano. I am trying to see if I can rebalance my stereo system to bring the cello to the forefront. So far, no luck. May be my lack of audio tech expertise, or may be the recording. I suspect the latter. Now that I have listened to the entire album on more than one system, I can definitely fault the recording. The piano simply overwhelms the more subtle tones of the cello."
3,"A very slow moving and borderline boring movie that is saved by the excellent ending. If you can do it, watch it. I say C+","""There's been an outbreak, a global pandemic that started in South America...from those infected there are no survivors. It's fatal and it's spreading rapidly."" Kate (Newton) and Martin (Murphy) are in marital trouble. After their first child is stillborn they find a house on a secluded island to stay in and try to work things out. Things are going OK until a stranger shows up on the island. This is a movie that is made by the ending. The entire movie is pretty slow moving and boring in some parts with only three characters in a house for most of the movie. If you stick with it though you won't be disappointed. The ending makes you re-think everything that was said in the movie and makes it better then it could have been. Overall, a bad movie with a good ending. I give it a C+."
4,Is he or isn't he?,"This is an intimate thriller in a vein similar to that of The Thing, where you have to wonder if the intruder is sick, if he is telling the truth about others being ill outside, and whether the two people he holds hostage are going to take ill, turn into zombies or something else. This will keep you wondering right up to the end, and even then there is another unpleasant twist.Nice work from the actors and a great location in Wales."
3,Decent psychological thriller,"You already know the plot. A couple with marriage problems goes to an island retreat, finds a bloodied stranger outside their cabin, and take him in. They find he has a gun. He wakes up, claiming the whole outside world's in the grip of a pandemic, and proceeds to board up the house.Is he lying? Is he a killer? What to do, what to do? If you're not too claustrophobic, sit tight ... most of the movie occurs in the house. It's tense, and you'll be trying to guess what's happening. Did he really see someone? Or is it a ploy? What's going on with the CB radio?In the end, there are some surprises, especially in our estimation of the intruder.I wouldn't call this a ""feel-good"" movie, but if this sounds OK to you, and you don't mind squirming for an hour or so, it's worth a watch."
1,The strap kills the watch,"The watch itself is nice. Its not as big as other Suunto watches, so if you have a small wrist, it looks and feels great. The problem is the wristband. Really. You will end up spending more money on cheap China made wristbands than the watch itself. On average one wristband lasts up to 6 months. After that it breaks and the company charges you a lot of money to replace it.My third wristband just broke today. I spent $180 dollars on the last 3 wristbands. If I buy another one it will be close to $240. I really don't understand why this company doesn't listen to customers and do anything about it. They won't even admit that they produce such crappy wristbands for their watches. So just be aware that if you buy this model (don't know about straps on their other models, but its worth Googling first) you will end up constantly replacing your wristbands."
3,Dracula The True Story review,"The tape is of good quality. It gives a general overview of Vlad the impaler and Bram Stoker. Don't expect a goldmine of details and information on either of the two men at 45 minutes in length it just doesn't have enough time. It provides a few insights on how the vampire legends were started and what other physical conditions might have made them flourish. It also delves into what inspired Bram to write his famous novel. It will would be a nice addition to any video library with the exception that it is so short. I would have liked much more detail. The information that you get is generally accepted as accurate, but just not enough of it. A good tape for someone who has no knowledge of Vlad the impaler or Bram Stoker. A little disappointing to someone who does."
2,Not good enough,"Please, if you know anything regarding Vlad Dracula you can tell McNally was living it up (even with bad teeth) He knows english, yet to make the CD more intruguing, he thought to use his german accent....poorly. The only reason he wanted to make this, was for publicity. Florescu was more about History, but McNally was more on mixing the two:Mythical and real. WHY are there so many trying to incorporate the mythical man with Bram Stokers ""Dracula"" Can anyone with a PHD or MBA get anything right? The woman who claims to be a decendent...yeah right..another publicity hound. This was interesting to watch, but hardly about TRUTH. Do not tell me that most of the writings about Dracula were made up by his enimies, and then try to use them as factual evidence abou him. Please,that is like using the National Enquirer to write history?"
5,Sometimes the truth is more complex then you can accept!,"Listen to everone, Read everything, then do you own research. David Icke himself will tell you not take any information as the 'gospel', do you own research. Just because something seems to be beyond belief doesn't mean it's not true. There are very bizarre things going on in the world and the illusion of reality that we create around ourselves it not 'True Reality'.What's really interesting is how people tend to believe whats true or not based on the interpretation of some institutional professional;i.e. Doctors,Lawyers,College Professors... However ,most of the time these sources are as disillusioned as the rest of us, although they claim to have been granted some higher wisdom , when in fact to the contrary. Be assured the facts of the truth have been withheld from all, regardless of their brainwashing education...David Icke is 99.9% right on the money with the information he presents and if you doubt it, then do you own research..."
4,very well researched,"David Icke has done an excellent job in put most of the pieces together in one book, a book that is easy to read for any novice. I found the book very informative, and I recommend it to everyone, with the added advice that everyone should read YAHOWAH's prophecies alongside this book. Reading this book by itself will leave you empty and without hope, but if you begin to understand that YAHOWAH is allowing these things to happen on earth for the sole purpose of bringing Israel to repentance than we can begin to understand YAHOWAH's mind.All these societies are allowed by YAHOWAH, through the instrument of Satan, to do these things, but YAHOWAH and His Son YAHO-hoshu-WAH are coming very soon, to destroy the works of the Devil.Thank you for your time.rs"
5,Rarely heard Reubke Sonata,Passionate and exciting performance of Reubke's only piano Sonata. Also includes an excellent performance of Beethoven's piano Sonata No. 21. Mr. Raymond has amazing technique and control.
5,Very Good Beethoven From Sawallisch and Royal Concertgebouw,"Admittedly this two-CD set will not be a primary recommendation of Beethoven's 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th symphonies for those familiar with Karajan's best recordings, Kleiber's electrifying accounts of the 5th and 7th symphonies, Harnoncourt's, Zinman's or Abbado's latest with the Berlin Philharmonic. However, I doubt I have heard the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra play these Beethoven symphonies with such brilliance and warmth, than I have on these recordings, even better than their classic 1970's recordings with Bernard Haitink. The two best performances are those of the 4th and 6th symphonies, with the 6th among the best I have heard for traditional versions, ranking close to the likes of Bohm, Dohnanyi and Karajan, among others. The sound quality for these early 1990's digital recordings is superb."
4,"If only it were current,","As a scotch whisky lover and trained historian, I found this book very informative to both my interests. It certainly explains why there are so many brands/blends of scotch, how they came to be and who the important people were in the development of the whisky industry in Scotland. Unfortunately the book is in need of updating, as much has changed in 20 years."
4,Rich Voice--Traditional Songs,"I discovered Ian Bruce at a Highlanders' Games in Fredericksburg, VA. He was performing live on a hot, steamy afternoon in mid-summer. What a terrific, rich voice! I've enjoyed this album immensely and recommend it highly to anyone who remembers the joys of '60s folk music before Dylan went electric."
2,Doesn't fully cover the Graco Ipo Duo,"Because of the way the canopies slope upward on the Ipo Duo, this Weather Shield doesn't get past the seats. It would work for infants, but my 3 year old's legs were out in the open when we tried this. In addition, this shield has a hole for the middle handle. If you don't have a middle handle, you have a large hole right in the top of the weather shield so water just drips in between the two kids. This might be good for other strollers, but if you have the Ipo Duo, look for another weather shield."
3,almost flawless,"This is a really good soundtrack. Planet Love by Taylor Dayne is excellent. When the Money's Gone, G.A.Y., Can't Stop Love, all deserve to be classice dance floor stompers. My only complaint is the rest of the songs are simply soundtrack fodder. Worth getting for the tracks listed. Definately worth the money if you are into club music. P.S. Half Breed is not a remix, it is the classic version. I was very disapointed Amazaon had it listed as a remix"
1,FLAWED,"This had a mediocre mix. I would have given this 2 stars, but Shirley Ellis' idiotic ""Name Game"" cost this cd a star. I have hated ""the name game"" since I was three and find it sheer torture. It is idiotic, unpleasant, highly irritating and has nothing in the world to recommend it. I would rather hear the train whistle and construction trucks than the ""Name Game."" I wouldn't wish Shirley Ellis on anyone."
2,Size really does matter,"Unfortunately, in recent years there has been an outbreak of mini-publications on Architecture. I have had the misfortune of buying several of them, including this one. This books measures 4x6 inches and is over an inch thick.(Amazon please include the book dimensions in your description)While filled with tantalizing pictures of recent Sydney residential projects, it leaves you disappointed because the images are just too small. The floor plans, elevations and sections, when provided, are hardly legible to serious Architectural review or analysis.In keeping with the miniscule format they have provided a very brief one or two paragraph description of the project which at best introduces you to the project, but leaves you wanting to read more about the site, design, materials, etc.Overall a coffee table book, for smerfs."
3,After six months...,"The main selling point of this mp3 player is its price, considering its capacity. I've had my player for more than six months now, and I'm still pretty okay with it, except for the following minor gripes:-The shell of the player is now cracking. (I never dropped it, in case anybody asks.) in some areas, so the construction is not as sturdy as initially claimed.)-Sometimes, when in random mode, the player only selects a number of songs, and loops them. (it doesn't randomize as much as I want to... something that is actually customizable in a recent iTunes upgrade)-The earphones are goners. Had them replaced after 3 1/2 months of use.In all, it still serves its purpose. It's a fairly decent player, and it doubles as a portable USB hard drive (no special software needed)."
3,"Good Content, Poor Writing","This book brings together a lot of information that I have not found elsewhere in one place.Be warned, however, that it looks like this book was never carefully proofread by a native english speaker. There are many grammatical errors, the sentence construction is so awkward at times that I had to read some things 2 or 3 times to get a sense of what she is saying and there are even some spelling errors. This was especially irritating because I paid over $100 for the book and expected a higher quality product."
5,Delbert McClinton,This is one album that my friend did not have but she is now glad she has !!! Thank you
1,Blame it on Amazon,The house numbers that were delivered from Ace Hardware were not the same as shown in the Amazon graphic. Ace said it wasn't their problem. I would have to pay return shipping and 're-stocking' fees -- not worth buying low cost items from Ace.
3,good book but...,"As the other reviewers have said, there are a lot of great things about this book. The author's tone is encouraging and the lessons are helpful. The pronunciation guide and hints are great. However, there are several typos and other typesetting and proofreading errors that take away from the quality of the book. Some even cause confusion. A book that teaches language should have been edited a little more carefully."
1,Not worth $1.00,The cuff is not an adult size. The balloon inside seems too small and as you start to pump the balloon is full at 20 and the velcro is coming apart. I dont recommend this product.
2,Poor Quality!!,"Although it arrived quickly, I was very disappointed with this sphygmomanometer. First of all, the cuff is a standard adult sized cuff, unlike what the description read as a ""large adult"" sized cuff! Second, it is made out of the most cheapest, flimsiest, paper thin plastic-like material that I have ever seen. I doubt that it will last long. It's going straight back! Do not buy this item- buy a better quality cuff that will last for years."
5,Brilliant!,The Ups and Downs of Being RoundTaste My SoulIt was amazing how the author took the book of Hosea from the Bible and turned it into a modern day story. Jacquelin Thomas has a way of teaching important life lessons without being preachy or intimidating. She gets the message across in a real and relatable way.
3,Perhaps....smooth funk?,"I don't know if I'd really call this Freestyle Funk. I get a different impression when I hear that term. This CD is more of a smooth variety. Roger Sause is definitely capable of producing solid, outstanding funk. This is evidenced from his prior recordings with Portland Oregon's SHOCK. It would be nice to see Roger revisit his roots and bring back some of the good ol' days."
4,"A simple, happy story full of repetition for young readers.","Pick this one up if you're looking for a light, easy read for small children. The bright, flat illustrations have a cartoonish feel. Sent to the store for whipped cream, a little girl takes a walk through her neighborhood. Along the way, she expresses simply thanks for the things she sees around her. ""Thank you, park. Thank you, warm boots. Thank you, fluffy clouds."" The repetition and simplicity of the phrases and will appeal to a young audience."
5,Kids book,I haven't found an Arnold Lobel book I didn't like. I can not imagine anyone not liking this kids book.
4,Excellent!,"This is my first Sara Evans album. I have listened to sampler tracks on the web from her previous albums, but they were a little too country for me. Being a folk music fan, I appreciated the country-pop sound that this album brought. She has a beautiful mezzo-soprano voice that is so clear. Her mild vibrato that is not too overpowering. The cover tracks sound fresh and new and one can barely tell that they were previously sung. All in all, it is worth the investment for country, pop, and folk fans alike."
2,dragon,"I only read 37 pages and I was lost, He jumps around I don't understand him or the purpose of the story. I've stopped reading it, it's not worth the hassle to try to understand it. I read a lot of books and I consider it not worth the money I paid."
1,Jumbled story line,"The author jumbles the story line to try to make the book more interesting. This is a writing style that can work well when plots have interesting plot twists. Actually it is a style that promises a plot twist, but not for this book as it had no plot twists. The book starts into the timeline and jumps back as the character recalls how he got there. I have perhaps read all of the authors books so I have liked the material in the past but it seems like each book becomes less interesting and more jumbled. In this book it is because the characters havent done a single thing that they havent done in past books. With the exception of the main character joining the army. However, the reason for the character joining the army wasnt believable. While people have certainly joined armies in real life for less, it really felt like it was against his character type."
3,Strikingly different but still great,"This book is a classic. If you like the way Steven Brust writes you will enjoy it if not you'll hate it. Although the plot develops much slower than the others and is much harder to read, it is still a fabulous piece of literature. I recommend reading Dragon first followed by Jhereg, Taltos, and Yendi, this way you know what they're talking about in the rest. Overall great."
4,Brust tells a good story,"I like Brust's Vlad Taltos novels, although I certainly have not yet read them all. This one was well grounded in established characters who behave consistently. About the only complaint/criticism I would offer Steven is that this one jumps back and forth in time and location so suddenly that it was often hard to decide where I was and what I was doing, so to speak. Still glad I read it, and eager for more."
4,doo doo doo we're on to you...,"Probably the best use of synths in rock / pop since the Talking Heads. I've left that sentence without additional qualifiers as synths may be considered by some to be the hallmark of cheesy 80s pop.My opinion? They've done it well this time. This first LP from Metric ascribes to a constant formula: nice lead guitar lines interspersed with catchy synth sequences while singer Emily Haines complains about media presentation, the war and bad relationships. The topics appear to be regular fare, but there is enough originality in the lyrics that it doesn't sound tired.If you want more legitimate and creative social outrage, go buy Rage. If you want a more introspective perspective on relationships, go buy Radiohead's OK Computer or even Comas' Conductor. If you have those albums, or even if you don't, grab this Metric album because it's definitely worthwhile. At worst, it'll keep Metric in your mind with the hopes that their sophomore album will be even more mature."
3,Almost really good,"3 1/2Taking some of the very trendy, superficial specialties found in a lot of New York indie music since the turn of the century and formulating a sort of synthesized respectability is enough to overcome any self-conscious hipness found in the lyrics and production."
5,Two Days With No Sleep,"Road Shoes is a page-turner that you won't want to put down. Reading it took a serious toll on my slumber for two days, but it was worth the sleep deprivation. Ms. Worden has written Road Shoes with a wry sense of humor, exploring a woman's deepest yearnings and fears. Who hasn't tried to prop up a failing relationship with the hope that it will turn out all right in the end? Laura Von Baden's move from the city to ""40 acres of cowpies"" is a vivid, sometimes funny and often poignant metaphor for the journey that unearths her own dreams and longings. In confronting the truth about her marriage and facing her fears, she discovers true love and ultimately, her true self."
4,Pretty Much Amazing,"Not quite the purple that you see on the bottle, it seemed to have a bit of a pink tone on my bleached sections of hair, but it showed up much better over the black sections. It was still a beautiful purple either way. It covered really well and was easy to use. Even on my over dyed hair it washed right out with one shampoo (Some brands tend to soak in and take a bit more to get out.) Definitely the best spray in color I've used."
3,"Good info on collaborations, but short on details and dated","This book has a wealth of information on how programmers work when in groups, and is a useful read for both managers and individual contributors alike. Many of the fuzzier, less-quantifiable people issues that affect programmers are covered well.However, it really suffers in three ways:- All of the examples and technology details are dated to the point of distraction.- The typography appears to be photocopies of the original text, and really looks terrible. Couldn't they have reset it?- Not a lot of concrete advice."
3,Makes some good points but is very hard to finish,I bought this book because it was on Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky's recommended reading lists. The author makes some good points about programmers but rarely support his ideas with more than a single hypothetical situation that he says he encountered. I found it too difficult to get past the half way mark of the book because I felt the author was assuming that everything he said was true.
1,inedible,"I sent this to my mother for Christmas which was a sad mistake, this thing was infested with bugs.She was insulted that I sent her what was clear to be a ""cheap gift"" and I was embarrassed to have sent it to her."
4,Kuyper is like eating your wheaties,"Kuyper is essential reading for developing a reformed protestant worldview. Reading Kuyper is to developing your worldview is like eating your intellectual wheaties. Few have developed and expounded on a reformed worldview with the clarity of the Kuyper system of thought. A great resource for anyone interested in reformed theology as it applies to politics, culture, and life in general."
1,An absolutely average publication.,This pamphlet (too light to be called a book in my opinion) was something of a disappointment. The knots were well described and illustrated but in no way added to my knowledge. The recommendations were difficult to follow but the brief history of ties was interesting. The section on handkerchiefs was similarly uninteresting. As a slim volume it would be a useful guide for the traveller particularly if he were about to wear a tie for the first time in his life upon arrival at his destination.
4,Just Listened to this yesterday,"I just found J4 yesterday and went to their site. From what I heard it sounds great. Great job J4. And by the way, the people at LOL Records are very kind! You have a great bunch there.Sheila"
5,This album ROCKS !!!,"J4 has a hot modern rock sound (like that of Matchbox 20 or a more melodic Third Eye Blind), This is the best kind of modern rock, almost pop, but with integrity, not bubble gum, or generic. ""A Dozen Dead Flowers"" is a tremendous show in melodies, and harmonies .If you've heard one of their songs on the radio, and liked it, give the rest of the album a try, I guarantee it's just as good, if not better. I've listened to this album over and over and never gotten tired of it."
2,defective-didn't work-was given full refund,"defective item, didn't work. I was given a full refund, i would skip this one, very frustrating, I ended up buying a sony that works great."
5,Perfect!,"This griddle is perfect in every way. It folds up to store easily yet is big enough to feed a crew. The plates snap in and out easily and are dishwasher safe. Very, very pleased and would recommend to all my friends."
4,Pretty good,"I like the Fold N Store Griddle. The removable cooking area is a much easier way to clean, and the size is large enough to cook a lot at once or several different things. Can also cook at two different temperatures at the same time. I would purchase it again."
3,I use it all the time.,"I have been using this for 10months. It stays on the counter top folded until I need it. I would buy it again, but...the pans heat unevenly, the pans warp over time, the right pan doesn't get as hot as the left, and it is slow to heat all the way up; however, it works for what I need."
3,ERRORS!,"There are so many errors in this thing, I am convinced that some of them are escaping my detection and I'm consequently learning incorrect information... seriously, errors out the A-hole in this one. I've been studying the math section for a whole 4 minutes and I've found 3 already.Nevertheless, it has been a good refresher (the book refreshing the concept but me fixing its errors...) and I do feel more confident and prepared to take the entrance exam."
2,this one is not that great,"I bought this book from the community college book store where at one point, I had hoped to attend nursing school. Not any more. This book is terrible with the math review (granted, I'm no math whiz, but still it didn't help). I was never able to get my score high enough on the math section in order to be considered for admission, even though I took the test three times! Don't waste your money on this one, folks, it's not worth it."
1,A non-mystery about people with no interests.,"I was extremely disappointed in this book which had been recommended highly by contributors to a mystery listserv. Not that it wasn't well-written. However, I waded through thousands of words waiting for something, anything to happen that would pique my interest. Instead, I got a running commentary on who-slept-with-whom for the past 20 or more years in a small town. Boring.I really love the idea of a slightly overweight, 40ish waitress as a heroine but Tory really needs to do some reading or find some other interests in life.Good characterization. Good writing. Just boring, boring people."
2,why is everyone in New Jersey so whiney?,"I think that the people that think this album is soooooo great are suffering from the same disalusion that I suffered when I first bought Saves the Day, Through Being Cool. At first I thought it was, but its really not that great. I was just depressed that day. Emo is over rated whiney music and most of the singers sound prepubesent. Go get your self some old school like DK or the Misfits. Or even some new stuff like Strung Out, they rock, or some melodic hardcore like Good Riddance. If you are serious about punk leave this [stuff] for the kiddies and throw a rocker sign that you can be loud and proud of."
1,Broken when I received it,"I purchased 2 of these traps. One was broken when I received it and when I attempted to return it Amazon had no record I ever ordered it (of course 2 months later I received this email to review the product I ""had no record of ordering""). The second trap has not caught a single mouse while the glue traps I set out near it have caught 3. Save the money and buy a $2.00 (for a pack of 4) glue trap."
4,Excellent Product,These traps are great! Don't have to see the mouse to dispose of it. I feel like this product is more humane than glue traps or traditional mouse traps.
1,So disappointed...,"I bought two of these almost 2 months ago. I really wanted something that wouldn't make the mice suffer, I just want them gone. And for the price I expected to get my $56's worth. I followed the directions exactly and even read through all the tips on the reviews. I haven't caught a single mouse with them. I finally went to walmart and bought some upgraded plastic snap traps, 3 for around $4, and caught 6 in the first two days. I'm so upset that I spent so much on a useless product."
3,Nice idea,"First delivery was damaged. Amazon replaced it quickly and without hassle. Otherwise, it is a well made device. You put peanut butter on the back wall of the device, just beyond the electrocution pads. There are holes on the wall, presumably so the little critters can find the peanut butter. They have managed to clean the peanut butter from the outside and inside of the death chamber (long, skinny tongues?). So far, no trophies. I'm planning to offer weekend cat sitting services."
4,"yes, a better mouse trap","Every winter, a few mice get into our crawl space. This trap is very simple to use and works. No more malfunctioning spring traps or sticky tape. I did not find that the blinking light works reliably, but I still think this is a better mousetrap!"
2,Not very durable,"I purchased this a few months ago, and I've caught about 5-6 mice with my trap. One day, I found out that the mice could not properly enter the mouse trap, and they ended up chipping the inside parts of the trap, causing the device to malfunction and break down. I have had to trash my trap, and I am not very satisfied with the durability of this mouse trap. Make careful decisions before purchasing this item."
4,Great mouse trap,Great mouse trap I caught my first mouse in the first week. I just had to use the right bait to catch the little rodent. The only bad this was that as soon as I opened the trapped door the little plastic hinge on it broke.
1,Mouse Trap Did Not Work,"Mouse got in, ate the peanut butter, and got out again without a problem. This trap just did not work."
1,gullible town mouse or smart country mouse?,"Maybe urban mice are more gullible, but out here in the country not a single mouse has even stuck a whisker inside this pointless gadget. I am sure it would work if only they would go inside, but they won't even though I have followed every optimization suggestion to the letter. With the money you save by avoiding this piece of junk you can buy a lot of the tried and true old fashioned wooden mousetraps."
3,No better than a snap trap,"I bought this, followed all the directions, read all the reviews for tips, and zip, zilch, nada. So I followed that up with a purchase of the same manufacturer's snap traps (which seem to make many of the reviewers here squeamish.) First night out, same bait: blam! Dead mouse. The only difference was placement of the traps. For the price of this trap and batteries, I can get 40 snap traps and a box of nitrile gloves so I never have to touch the mouse or whatever oozes out of it.For those of you who think that snap traps are inhumane, consider that mice are vectors for rabies, bubonic plague, hanta virus and other diseases that are gruesome and fatal in humans. If you want to take your chances with that, go ahead, but don't expect me to follow your lead."
1,Don't Waste your Time or Money,"I got this thing on Monday. Called the 800 number on Thursday of the same week for a refund.I've tried several baits and placed it different places where I have seen mice travel back and forth. Nothing! The kicker was when I placed it down one night and saw the light flashing the next morning. When I opened the trap, I not only saw that there was no dead mouse, but the bait I placed in the trap was gone as well.I decided to try the Snap-E Mouse trap by Kness Mfg Company. You can buy them cheap on Amazon.com.If your still debating on whether or not to buy this electronic mouse feeder they call a trap, read the reviews on Amazon.com before blowing your money away."
1,Caught by ab electronic trap,Purchased this and expected it perform as advertised. I guess I have no electronic mice where I live. The only thing caught was me for purchasing it.
3,Works...but quit working,"I have to say, I was singing the praises of this trap too after 10 confirmed kills in 3 weeks. Just flip up the lid and dump - never touching the mouse...nice.No activity for awhile and then a couple of days ago, the peanut butter disappeared, but no mouse. The trap seemed to be charging ok, but I'll replace the batteries just to be sure. The next day I saw the light flashing and opened the lid to find the mouse sitting on the electric plate alive!Closed the lid and turned it on again (recharges it) zzzzzap...did it again...zzzzzzap...one more time...zzzzzzzap. Opened the lid - still alive - dumped it into a ziplock and smashed it. I'm going to try another one today and buy a good 'ol snap trap as well. I'll wait for a couple of weeks to see if the new one fails as well and update this post (org 12/28/05)."
1,No good!,"After 1 mouse, the dead mouse indicator light stopped working. After three, the whole thing won't work, really pisses me off, $20 down the drain and just one more mouse to go."
3,it's okay,"We've had this trap in the past and it worked great, until my son dropped it in the toilet. I was so excited to get these and for the first few days they worked great, and then they quit. I have tried wiping the metal plates with a q-tip dipped in alcohol, changing the batteries and nothing has helped. While I have had good results in the past i'm not very happy with these. I have gone back to the nasty snap traps and they work great."
1,Does not work,"I have had this device for approximately one month and so far, there has not been one mouse trapped, killed or whatever. There are signs of mice, but none caught. I will keep baiting it and trying for another month, and if nothing I will strictly go back to the old type of traps, evil as they may be."
2,Really wanted this to work...,"Bought this mouse trap hoping to curb the rampant mouse problem in my apartment. I've had it for a few months now and so far caught nothing with it. Even tried moving it around to different parts of the apt, adding more peanut butter, etc. The city mice seem to be wise to it, somehow. The only thing that's working in any noticeable way is poison, unfortunately. Save your $20!"
1,Not Good,"Set this thing up with fresh batteries over 3 weeks ago in a space where I've actually seen a mouse. Nothing. Got our handyman to check, changed batteries, bait - still nothing. Not worth the money. Never again."
1,Dead on Arrival,"I had purchased a Victor Electronic Mouse Trap at a Home Depot..the last in stock. It did away with 12 mice in 36 hours! My husband wanted one for his office, but none could be found locally, so I turned to Amazon, and ordered this one. It had a slightly different product code, but was the same in all other respects. It worked for about 3 days, one mouse, and quit. We installed new batteries, cleaned the plates, etc., but nothing worked. Very disappointing. I would have sent it back, but husband tossed it before I could do so."
4,Catch and Zap mouse,"I am happy with the purchase and it works as advertised. I caught 4 mice in 4 days.Caution - the cover came off (not sure if it broke) and to make the device work had to really snap it in place. I was thinking of returning it, but it works as long as you close it in a certain way."
1,Haven't caught anything,"I have had this trap for almost a week now. I have placed the trap in several locations. Once in the run path of the mice, nothing. Secondly, on my cabinet shelf where they have been eating, nothing. Thirdly, beside the fridge, nothing. I have even tried to lure them into the trap by placing raisins going into the trap, nothing. I have tried the whole peanut butter thing too and nothing. I must have very skeptical mice because they haven't fallen for this trap. I have to say I am extremely disappointed with this product, especially after the money I have spent on it. I love animals and hate the thought of killing them (yes, even mice). Thought this trap would be the most humane way to get rid of them. I hate to say it hasn't worked.If anyone has any suggestions, I would love to hear them!"
3,Great -- when it works,"I've used these mouse traps over the last few years, mostly bought from Home Depot. In the past, we usually trapped 5 or 6 mice, and then the trap stopped working. (Now that I've read other reviews, I realize that peanut butter may have gottn on the bottom of the trap and shorted it out). But I just bought two from Amazon and as another reviewer, said, ""they make great mouse feeding stations."" Mice cleaned out the peanut butter without the trap going off. I tried 3 different sets of batteries with no luck."
1,No mice caught :(,"I was excited to buy a product like this since I have a barn with horses and mice are a problem. I have dogs and do not use poison. I thought this was the perfect answer to my mouse problem.At this point, snap type mouse traps without bait have caught 3 mice, my Labrador Retrievers have caught 4 mice and this trap has not caught any. I have even moved the trap to an area where I have mouse activity - directly blocking the hole. No mice caught. In my mind, this was a waste of money."
1,No Takers,"I purchased two of these traps from Amazon and a third from Home Depot. I've seen evidence that a mouse has been near them, but not one has gone inside. I had high hopes for this product, as our rodent problem seems to be increasing. Could it be that New York Mice are more cunning than the rest?"
2,we're not in kansas in anymore!,"Gee, I'm disappointed. In fact, I bought this online in advance of it's release. Why am I disappointed?I've seen them in concert on the ""40 acres"" tour. I know how good they are and that they kick booty musically.After listening to this album, my impression is some record company exec or record producer convinced them that it's ""time to mature their sound"", i.e. move closer to the mainstream pop goo.Folks, you're much better than what's on this album. Fire your producer and go with your own style. It's great and I believe there's still plenty of room for growth and maturity without sounding like every other mainstream band out there."
3,What's happening to Caedmon's Call?,"What on earth is happening to Caedmon's Call? Their first CD was so awesome, and although Long Line of Leavers is good in its own right, it falls so short of what I expect from them!Although many tracks in the album are good, they're not like Caedmon's Call used to be (40 Acres is the same way), except for track 13 (Ballad of San Fransisco). And several of the tracks (i.e. track 6) just are no good no matter how you slice it.This CD is worth buying for a Caedmon's fan, but if you've never heard Caedmon's Call before, opt for their self-titled album first."
4,x-men beltbuckle.,"This product arrived on time, however it was black with a silver logo instead of black with a white logo. It didn't really matter to me but it didn't match the picture."
1,very very very very poor service,Item send wrongly and never send the correct item immediately. Took another 14 days to send out and will took another 12 business days to reach singapore.
2,Amateurish,"Quite frankly, this is an amateurish quickly made documentary meant to make a fast buck from Susan Boyle's fame. If you have an all-region DVD player, get the British ""Susan Boyle Story"" from the BBC which you can get for about $15.00 on Ebay. It's much better done.JF"
3,Ho hum,"Not as informative as I thought it would be. I thought there would be more background information, but it was okay."
3,good music,"Had to return the CD as it was defective. I enjoyed the music the one time that it played, but one time was all I got to listen to."
4,a good tool,I bought this CD for my Hindi speaking mother. She definitly got a lot out of it. Pace of practice was very comfortable for a 70 year old lady. Some people might find it a little slow.
3,Fantastic,"Loved every page. I really wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy Fruit Fly, but it certainly exceeded my expectations. The story was able to take me into a different world, one of which I've had very little exposure to. Thoroughly enjoyable!"
5,Great Service,"I have been more than pleased in the five months I've had the monitor. Recently, there was some color distortion in a corner (dark greys were light). I called technical support and the rep. was extremly helpful. After he deemed that my problem was no easy fix that I could do over the phone, he said that he would ship a refurbished monitor to me free of charge 2nd day air. I just had to pay the [money] shipping to return my current one and they took my credit card number to hold in case I didn't return my semi-broken one. All I had to do was pack up my old monitor in the box that the new one came in and it was a done deal. My new monitor looks great and I couldn't be more happy with their customer support. GREAT WARRANTY!"
5,A Documentary that everyone should see,"This documentary relies heavily on ideology from Chomsky with a smattering of history that leaps straight out of Dilip Hiro's books. While this documentary is definitely biased in favor of the Palestinians and opposes the Israeli view, all of the arguments are well-documented and the material goes a long way to dispel much of the anti-Palestinian propaganda we have been fed in the West [especially] since 1972. If you have any interest in hearing an alternative point of view on the Middle East this is your documentary, and it also contains much on the real underlying factors [namely oil and commerce] in the marginalization of huge segments of the Middle East's population."
1,Pulling the wool over the real history,"The second part of the title is correct - this video continues the intrigue over the complex history of the Middle East. There is no historical anlysis, no coherent presentation of the events, it is bad documentary and pitiful journalism. This video is an extremely biased attempt to present the Arabs as passive victims of imperialist Western powers and the Jews and never mentions Arab violence against the Jewish population in Palestine before the World War II nor collaboration of the Grand Mufti Mohammad Amin al-Husayni with the Nazis during the WWII. The remainder of ""history"" after WWII is below criticism. A critical historical account of the last hundred years of this region is given in the excellent ""The Siege: The Saga of Israel and Zionism "" by Conor Cruise O'Brien."
5,The principled way to build a GREAT enterprise,"While many leaders in businesses fight to be at the top of the heap and at the expense of others, ""Pushing up people"" shows how that you can be principled in business and succeed by being the link that builds others up. I'm glad to have a signed copy. Thanks COACH!!!! GO GO GO! DO IT!"
1,idiot,i just wanna say that some one iz a dum@$$ jay z and dmx aint on murder inc they actually good you cant be good if your on murder inc dmx is on ruff ryders and def jam and jay z is on roc a fella and def jam get it right
4,VERY GOOD EFFORT IN THIS ALBUM !,"THE MURDERERS ARE A YOUNG RAP GROUP.THIS ALBUM IS GOOD,THE BEATS,LYRICS ARE GOOD.JA RULE IS THE BOMB.VITA IS ONE OF THE HOTTEST LMC IN THE WORLD.I DON'T LIKE BLACK CHILD HE HIS TO PHONY.TAH MURDA IS OK,HE'S BETTER THAN CHILD.THIS ALBUM IS WORTH BUYING.IRV GOTTI IS DOING GOOD FOR HIMSELF."
5,This albulm is hip hop for the next generation.,When i first heard this albulm i was blown away by the tight beats and the phat lyrics i would recomend this to any east cost hip hop fan. But all i really need to say is ja rule who i think is on the same level as DMX and the ruff ryder crue so if you buy one albulm buy this im out.
5,Str8 Murdah,"Irv Gotti bust's out a tight cd from Murder Inc. WIth songs like we murderers baby f. ja & vita , or how many wanna die for me this is a cd u will definitley wanna pick up."
3,complicated user settings,difficult to see image on screen especially in low lightseveral blurred photographsseveral red eye photographs
5,Phatty,"I'm a man who uses this product for my moustache and beard. I find this particular product to be less expensive, and easier to use than other products I have purchased through you for the same reason."
3,EXTANG 44630 TRIFECTA 6' BED 2011 FORD RANGER,BUYER BEWARE THIS COVER DOES NOT COMPLETELY COVER STAKE HOLES ON TOP RAIL OF BED THERE IS NO REASON THE COVER CAN'T BE MADE WIDER.XTANG NEEDS TO LOOK AT THIS PROBLEM!
2,I need MORE!!!!!!!!!,"Okay, here it is--I've read William Bernhardt for many years and really enjoyed his ""Ben Kincaid"" series. However, I want to get ALL the Ben Kincaid books IN ORDER! Mr. Bernhardt refers to previous books too often and his character has evolved so much, that I want all of the books numbering 1-?TAT"
4,Great item. Thank you.,Item was shipped very fast - although the post office is what took so long to get it to me - but I know it was originally shipped very quickly - item itself is great - was exactly as described.
2,Garbage !!!!,WTH!?!! This was some B RATED mess and Simple as all get out!!!! Like; The best thing about this DVD is the artwork on the cover!!!
2,Not Real,This is a Japanese spoof at the sex lives of men and women. Parts of it stretch the limits of believablilty
4,Personal Review,"Great actors, very hot actresses and the story is good, you won't get bored watching it again and again. Can't wait for Part 2 - not sure if it already came out yet."
4,Upbeat music that grows on you,"I needed to listen to this CD a couple of times before I really liked it, but now I do, it is very upbeat which is great for the car stereo or party."
4,Very pleased with the program!,"I found the words in the program challenging and would highly recommend this concise program. Some of the other programs out there spell every word and when you need to listen to them multiple times to remember the words the spellings seem very redundant. And for those who want a book with the words spelled, the original publisher sells a printable and downloadable workbook as an add-on to the program."
1,They are simply useless,CD 1-4 is just a collection of words that not even spelled. The other CDs don't contain any useful information and the 2 bonus DVDs; only one of them has some good information but they are simply useless to me in general.
1,Would have been nice if they were not defective...,4 of the disc's in the set were defective. This must be a common problem with Amazon because the last book on disc I ordered was partially defective also. Quality control should step it up a bit.
4,nice stories,"when you're in the mood for some short whistful escapist romantic stories in a celtic setting, pick up this one. good for a rainy sunday afternoon."
1,Morgan LLywelyn...Galway Bay...Other 3 stories great!,"Other than the initial introduction of Eileen's love interest, there was nothing even remotely interesting about this story. The entire book was about Eileen and the other characters - the professor, the couple who owned the inn, the shop owner, and the restaurant owner, but only twice, I believe, with her love interest, which consisted of a few words between them and that was it. It was just stupid."
1,wrong item,"I received the item promptly. It was not as advertised; it was a partial rack (only the ""feet""); I ordered the holders and rails separately. The #368 was not for my car(2009 Toyota Carolla); the seller exchanged it for #369; it still doesn't fit my car. I now have over $200 worth of rack that I can't use."
5,Drgon keeper the best book ever!!!,Dragon keeper is a story that has been written very creatively and in that you can't very well put the book down. We had to read this book for a competition as well as three other books and my group had handed me the biggest one. Dragon keeper. At first I thought this book would be a long boring story but it turned out exactly the oposite. I strongly reccomend this book to all readers!
4,Revealing on an Unprecedented Level!!!,David Gallaway does a brillant job of dazzling the senses. The story is non-stop intense action with a plot that is almost too real. The character development and accuracy that takes place in the story cause the reader to feeling as if they themselves are traveling around the world! I give this book 3 thumbs up!!!
3,Osmand Family Christmas,I was very disappointed with this cd because it is not the true Osmaond Family Christmas. Some of the songs are missing. So when you order it make sure you check out the songs. I had this album when I was a little girl so I know that it had around 14 songs (souble album) and I knew everyone I just assumed that this would be the same. So check it out first. There are some that has all of them on it I just recieved the one that didn't. I am not happy. the songs are wonderful!!
2,Overrated,"I should have waited to browse the book in a store before ordering online. This book is clearly inferior to rival products, such as in The Missing Manual series. Many practical tips in the latter are missed entirely in this one. Also, the English in this book is substandard, which sometimes makes it unclear what is being affirmed."
5,Want success? Read this book!,"This book is a treasure of wealth and knowledge. While some of these success principles are not new, many are....and the ones I already knew, served as good reminders for me to improve on them. I like the short chapters in this book, which makes it easy to read this book when I have a few extra minutes of down time. There were at least 10 principles that I have added into my daily life, that have changed my life in an amazing way. Get this book, if you want to improve your personal and professional lives!"
3,DONT DO THE COACHING,"The book was great and I thought that it would be good to do the coaching. After an emotional hard sell. I was having some bells and whistles go off, but I thought, roll with it... Like jack says. On the phone I was told that these were jacks personal coaches. Come to find out, the same company does Robert Kiyosaki's ""personal coaching"". I googled all of my coaches and they had no street cred whatsoever.It was incredibly disappointing and a waste of time. Not to mention, I felt like a sucker for not trusting my gut and calling them on the carpet throughout the whole process.Buyer beware. If it sounds too good, it is!!!"
5,The Success Principles,I love this book! It is very precise and clearly written. Everyone should own a copy!
3,Great motivational book...,"If you want learn how to plan and reach your goals, as well as how to deal with failure or roadblocks, this may be the book for you. Overall, it is extremely inspirational and motivational, and having read it from beginning to end, I do have much more enthusiasm and optimism about goals, success, and life in general. However, I only gave this book three stars because upon closer observation, it is merely a collection of other books' ideas. In every chapter and sub-chapter, Canfield references the books and programs of other authors, including his own, and encourages readers to investigate them further. So in a way, it's a giant collection of advertisements and self-promotion, with the material serving only as a brief overview of those books, programs, authors, etc."
5,OMG YES,"I love reading books and this one, I had to stop every few pages to absorb the info in each page. This is a thick book, however the pages are so filled with great stuff. Jack is no joke............... Buy it"
1,One big yawn.,"This book would only appeal to the most sophomoric and novice reader. 500 pages filled with the same old regurgitated mantra of ""TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR SELF!"". The difference between the masterpieces of Dale Carnegie or Napoleon Hill, for example, is that Jack Canfield is a bogus money-loving media man who brings nothing new but a couple of trite moronic phrases in this supposed ""secret to eternal happiness and riches"". Insipidity abound.I really couldn't stand passing by his face on the shelf so I just gave it away. Steer very clear from this, unless you are really desperate and/or dumb."
1,Disappointing,"After reading the great reviews about this product, I could not wait to place my order. When I received it, I tried it right away. While I was grinding it, the smell of lime was noticable but I could not detect any lime taste as I ate the food it was used on. I tried it again yesterday on a different food product and got the same results...lime smell but no lime taste. I am very disappoited expecially after reading the reviews that said what a good lime taste it produced on their food."
5,Great love story,"This is an excellent story of loves that can not be. I couldn't put the book down it was so good, I just kept on reading. It made me think seriously about what really matters in relationships."
5,Very sensitive,"I was really impressed about this senistive insight in a world, which we able bodied people don't know so good."
3,Stunningly Mediocre!,"I have been singing the praises of dark horse for their run of excellently done Star wars based comics. That is why I was stunned at how poorly done this one was. The story is a mediocre telling rated at 2.5. Pencils are a 3, but coloring is just plain dull. There is not one page that makes you say WOW. I will certainly be more careful in my purchases of comics colored by Curtis Arnold and Dave Stewart in the future as they rate a 2.5 for this rush job. The best part of the comic is the pencil work of Ryan Benjamin, he gets a 4. Hopefully he gets teamed with a better group next time out."
2,Disappointing Effort,"I am a fan of Bill Watrous but was very disappointed with this effort. The mic used on the trombone was terrible -- Bill Watrous' wonderful tone was apparently muffled by the mic and seemed to waver throughout the CD. I also found Joe Ascione's drumming to be -- at best -- a distraction. Perhaps it was again a function of poor mics, but Ascione's overuse of crash cymbals at times overwhelmed the rest of the ensemble."
1,"DONT BUY-the net can come OFF, on bb's mouth!!","after using it for only 3 times, I already found that the blue net material comes off in small particles, and I found these particles on my bb's lips!! How scary. I hope to alert other mummies of such dangerous product. I wish to return this product as well, I don't want an exchange as I find it too scary, what if bb eat it into stomach? Or already got into bb's stomach now."
4,Daughter loves it,"My daughter is happily making a mess of a banana using this feeder as I type this. She LOVES it and we love the fact that it offers some teething relief. Pretty easy to use, although we own two and one seems to be slightly more difficult to open and close. I only gave it 4/5 stars because as others have noted, cleaning it is a pain, although it's not impossible. We're going to also try one of the silicone ones to see if those are easier to clean. The happiness this brings her is worth the cleaning hassle however, and I'd still recommend this product.http://www.amazon.com/winning-Kidsme-Feeder-Months-Yellow/dp/B005KWL0OI/ref=sr_1_1?s=baby-products&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1332983943&sr;=1-1"
2,Hard to clean,My baby enjoys feeding himself banana with this feeder but it's hard to clean. The banana gets all stuck in the net creases.
2,Much smaller than I had anticipated,"Maybe I didn't read the description very well but I was very surprised when these arrived. They were very, very tiny."
3,"What's a ""collication""?","Made in CAN in 1997, Serial# 314-540-836-2, Playing Time 67:37Interesting how many people think the title is ""An Accidental Collision Of Atoms?"", when in fact, it's ""An Accidental COLLICATION Of Atoms"".EXTREME was a complicated band: not because they made complicated music, but because each album was both diverse and uneven; this album is a compilation of stuff from their 4 albums. People tend to critize these types of items because THEIR favorite didn't ""make the cut"".For a band like EXTREME, such a compilation is, in my humble opinion, a mistake. Each album has a personality and a sound of its own.If you're interested in their music, buy 1 (or more) of their albums. This compilation will simply confuse you as to their musical adventure, mostly because the material isn't presented chronologically, which is my preference.For the unconditional fan, track 9 is a non-album remix. It seems the rest of the world is still waiting for the punchline... and this isn't it!"
4,Excellent modern version of Meyerbeer's classic,"Although the modern dress production with its fascist uniforms may not appeal to everyone, the story is told clearly and keeps fairly closely to the original in dramatic concept. Richard Leech's Raoul is alone worth the price of the DVD. His singing is absolutely top notch and very exciting. The rest of the cast are pretty good too. Only one draw back - French would have been preferrable, but it's a small quibble.Altogether a fine recording visually and musically."
1,"Shed Stop, why oh why did you go away?","I used the ORIGINAL Shed Stop (green logo)for years with great results in several dogs' coats. Nice soft, silky fur to pet and reduced shedding on my carpet. But now the product formulaShed-Solution for Dogs, 1 GallonShed Pro for DOGS - 24 FL OZShed Stop Gallonhas been sold, I'm told, and the product no longer works. Both companies I tried - Shed Solution and Shed-Pro, told me they had the lady's original Shed Stop formula. But, alas, it is not true. Neither product was the same solution in appearance or performance. I am so disappointed. My golden retriever will shed out her last years and so will my beagle. Too bad. It WAS a terrific product. I shall miss it."
1,Dissatisfied,Pure junk. Everything feel apart with a week. The company Bemis doesn't back up their product either. Beware before yo buy!!!!
1,'Richard Branson'at his worst,There is no such thing as people being able to completely be in control of their lives.Life is something you cannot possibly be in control over.People can keep labelling everything they see and hear as illusion because they saw it and heard it and that won't get them anywhere near the truth.There is Truth.There is Reality.There is Realities.Period.
2,More tripe from Icke,"Here we have more speculative, unsupported drivel from Icke.What big mysteries has Mr spoonfeeder got in store for us plebs now ? Well, Mr DIcke thinks he's discovered the ""God"" program and how reality is ""downloaded"" into our DNA. Uh-huh, so I guess he should fill us in on the loony program as well or doesn't that generate a system crash ?Poor Icke, he's completely lost his marbles with this one. At least his previous books were somewhat factual. This book is so out of left field and full of straw-grasping theories, it's a wonder this bloke can sleep at night.Only recommended for nitwits and misguided fools."
1,Airy-fairy New Age garbage!,"What a complete lump of dog excretement this book is!Icke is clearly living in a delusional fantasy world if he thinks one can ""transform"" themselves out of this so-called ""Matrix"". Face-it Mr Icke, you like everyone else are padlocked in this cesspit called ""life"" and no wishful thinking on your part is going to change that. And please, GET A LIFE YOU DILL BRAIN."
5,Infinite Love Is the Only Truth Everything Else Is Illusion,Another great book by David Icke.. I found it very up lifting. It's the kind of book you don't want to put down. I read it form cover to cover and totally enjoyed it.
3,"Fallen short of expectations, after knowing the film music","What a rip off. I bought this cd on the strength of the film soundtrack. The particular song I wanted was the original Frankie and Johnnie as per the opening sequence of the film. How disappointed was I whan some cheesy sounding singer a la corny country and western starts crooning.Apart from that, the classical/instrumental pieces are good: Flower Market and the Debussy. 'must be love' is good too, as is the Doubie Brothers. The rest of the tape is poor...and where in the film, do they figure?? Clearly they don't, they've been shoved in for good measure. Such a shame, such a disappointment."
3,This book was fair,I have one tip when you are reading this book suspect the one you would least suspect!!!I like thius book beacuse it is a suspence thing and if you want that in a book I really recomend it.The suspects motives may be weird but that makes it a good book read slow and you might pick up on the Murderer...
1,Misleading title for this book,"I'm not sure why I assumed a book entitled ""Upgrading to Lotus Notes and Domino 7"" would offer any assistance in upgrading. Guess what? It doesn't. It glaces over the professed main topic in a mere 13 pages at 13,000 feet, which is of no help to anyone save a Domino expert - who would not need this book anyway. Save yourself the nearly $60 and browse the IBM website where you can get an overview of new features in Domino 7 for free. This is worthless."
1,Disgraceful,This plebian comptemptuous tifling monstrosity book pushes the imperialist capitalist agenda to no end. It is a by-the-numbers course in democratic brainwashing.
3,a lesson learned,"Death of a Salesman was confusing to read as a play, but better understood when seen acted out. Willy Loman's flashbacks caused much of the confusion, but opened many doors for the reader to see who Willy was. This story made me look at success in a completely different way. I once thought like Willy; success is seen through material things, but now I see the ignorance in that thought. Now I see that success can be seen in how hard you work and how happy you are. This play will never grow out-dated. It holds many themes and experiences that people will go through forever."
2,Making Sales,"I recently read this book for my Literature class and bat I remembered that I had read it before.The is a middle school level. I really enjoy reading it whith the class some times I woud loose my places but I catch on whith the rest of the class.I learn more about how to make sales and to control my temper.Not like Willy in the play he dont know how to control his temper.My father and I both are sales man.We both have a small business,Sales business run in are famaly from generation."
3,just gotta read it,"Although Death of a Salesman wasn't one of my favorites, I'm glad to have read it. It's one of those books that everyone has to read once. It is a classic tale of Willy Loman, a man who has worked his whole life as a traveling salesman, whose hopes and dreams are just out of reach. But instead of making you feel bad for him, he manages to do a whole lot of rotten things to make you just about hate him. When he realizes his own life has been a failure he depends on his son, Biff, to become a success. But instead of encouraging him to do well in school, he tells him his looks and personality will bring him straight to the top. Needless to say, this is not the case. Stupid, pathetic Willy manages to ruin his own life and the lives of those around him. So read it and find out, its one of those you've just gotta read."
3,Something's Missing,"Whew! I had to hunt for a minute or two to find someone else who wanted ""Midnight Sun"" to be on this collection. For a while, I was afraid I was the only one. I was not a serious Shaun Cassidy fan, but for some reason I had the 45 with that song on it. It's beautiful! Rest of the disc be whacked, if that had been on it, I'd have spent the bucks. I think I'll go search for that 45 . . ."
2,"Poorly Packaged, Cheap Compilation","There is so much really bad media available these days (yes you can get T.J. Hooker on DVD), it's hard to believe that SOMEONE hasn't remastered and released Shaun Cassidy's original albums on CD. No, it wasn't great stuff, but there was always a track or two or four, that were first-rate pop.In a world where The Brady Bunch CDs are available, how can it be that Shaun Cassidy's are not?This collection contains all his hits (all 4 of them) and a few decent album tracks but it's missing a lot of good material."
1,Defective - No magnetism in the base,"I must of got a defective unit because the base is not magnetic. It won't attract to any iron or steel surface. Even if it weren't defective I doubt it would securely hold std. 2-1/4"" dial indicators. It's very tiny."
5,American Girl: Felicity Series,"I bought this series for my granddaughter (age 9) for Christmas, and she has already finished all six books. Needless to say, I will be purchasing more and recommend these as a good reading and learning experience. I chose these books as they would also be an introduction to American History besides being a good read for a young girl.Diane Isaac"
5,"Outstanding, educational, heartwarming books for young girls","These books are an excellent educational toolto show young girls (ages 6 to 12) what their lifewould have been like if they had lived duringcolonial times, during the revolutionary war, andduring the birth of our nation. The books are wellresearched and are historically accurate. Girlswill learn what colonial children did for fun, whattheir chores were, what their education was like, and what the social customs were at the time.The main character, Felicity, is headstrong, butalso kind and loving. She reminds me a little ofthe stories I've heard of Martha Washington.I would recommend these books for younggirls today - they don't receive enough of a history education in school these days. You might find yourself, as we did, on your way to visit Williamsburg, VA to ""see where Felicity lived!!"
5,Immerse Your Soul,"The finest acoustic instruments and flat-pickers on one album.""Very O'Brother Where Art Thou"" with old-style country and gospel sung over a century ago with an extraordinaire passion and talent. Very good collection of Peter Ostroushko-influenced Norman Blake and Norman Blake-influenced Peter Ostroushko (""Majorie's Waltz #3"" gets very 'moody'). Nancy Blake's cello was a welcomed edition to many of the tracks to completely immerse your soul."
1,"Great artist, messed up album","Don McLean is one of the finest artists ever. This album does not reflect that. Seven alternate takes. The worst one is Vincent. The main line is screwed up, and many songs are totally out of rhythm. Don't Buy this."
4,Snowy fun,Shi Resort Tycoon is porably the best ski resort based game around. With detailed pictures this is a must get game. Its' only downfall is it is a bit easy to master and hasn't got as many places you can go
1,"Another error, Wake up!","Here's another 4.4lb bag of dog food that does not represent the normal ""regular"" price. At that standard per pound price, you could be buying the juiciest prime filet mignon and get to watch man's best friend become even a better best friend! Wake up Amazon!"
2,More like meals in an hour,"As usual, I was impressed with Dr. Sears' commentary on his Zone diet, but I was fairly disappointed with the recipes in this book. I was happy I bought it used because I never really open it. The only thing I actually use from the book is the list of mix-and-match snacks at the very end. The recipes are horribly complicated, time-consuming and call for ingredients you probably wouldn't normally have in your kitchen. I have yet to actually make a meal from this book because I simply do not have the time. I'm sure that if I did, it would taste wonderful, but because the title of the book ""Meals in Minutes"" is so far from the truth, I'm giving it a 2 out of 5. If you're thinking about purchasing this book, go with a used edition, and keep in mind that you won't be getting quick and easy meals ... but rather gourmet meals that will take about an hour to prepare and make."
2,Not enough edible recipes,"This book was good in that I could skim through 3 short chapters and understand the Zone concept completely. It's really all I needed to know to get going. Also, the quick list of food blocks in the back was great. However, the recipes are gross. I have never seen so much cabbage in a cookbook. Just gross. The Formula has better recipes."
5,feeling better,"This book is full of easy things to cook and eat, in portions that are ment for maximum health benifts."
2,Very very small for a glove that's supposed to be one size fits all...,"For a disposable glove they do the job. The vinyl is durable enough for light messy work, like changing my car's oil or picking up trash after a raccoon knocks over the trash barrel, gnaws on leftover chicken bones and leaves a mess to clean up.But... I've ruined (torn) a good number of these just trying to put them on as they barely fit my small hands."
4,Crunchy space surfin rock,"This album (actually all Fu Manchu albums) strongly resemble Ace Frehley's ""Rocket Ride"" in many completely different ways.That is a good thing."
5,Best Stand Up Comedian of all time!,"I have watched Lewis Black's specials on Comedy Central, and to be quite honest, they were absolutlely hilarious! He has 4 thirty minute specials on this DVD, all of them topical comedy and very funny. I know that I am going out on the first day this comes out to purchase it. The man doesn't get near enough credit that he deserves I think. You can see him on ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart"" in an occaisonal skit called ""Back in Black"".I garantee that you will laugh until your gut hurts if you buy this DVD(unless you lived in a cave and haven't listened to the news in the past 6 years).This is truly a masterpiece of comedic genius. As far as stand up is concerned, this is the AMG Mercedes Benz or Porsche Turbo. This the best of the best."
5,awsome,Amazing book with allot of info. I would recommend it for anyone. Very good purchase. Now I have to get a second one for a friend.
3,grass scythe,Works very well. I had to put in a screw to keep the hook itself from jiggling. Also painted the handle with exterior polyurethane. It was just raw wood and would have accepted all stains. It felt better after I applied the preservative. Happy it works just as it should.
4,Definite upgrade from a Floppy Drive!,"Need a ""little"" more storage then a floppy drive with far more portability? Look no where else but a USB Flash Drive. This 64MB comes with 62MB available space.The package also includes a USB cable to connect to computers that have USB Ports in the back of the computer, or are hard to access otherwise. Simply plug it in and it'll auto-detect (2000 & XP) and show a new removeable hard drive available.The two downfalls I see are no write protect solution and no keychain/ring that comes with it to attach to a keychain. Otherwise, I recommend it!"
4,Another Lost Rebate,"Works great and is consistent. I'm also concerned about the loose cap and disappointed at the lack of lanyard. This would have been a great buy, except that my rebate has also not yet come! It's been over 12 weeks for me, too. What do we do?"
5,A Must Have!,"I just started giving this book as a gift to all newborns! It sends such a great message. In this materialistic world of ours, it's nice to know that happiness can be taught and shared through the simple things in life."
2,"Good concept, but only OK...","Good concept, but still very old-fashioned---I don't know anyone, let alone a mom, who plays a banjo!""If that lighning bug won't glow, Mama's going to play on her old banjo.""I thought it was going to be more up-to-date. One the plus-side, the board book seems good and sturdy..."
3,Not A Value!,"I am terrible with sizes-and I thought these were the big nutella jars. They're not. They're the little tiny ones. So, by the time I paid for the item AND shipping, I would have saved about 15$ just buying them in my local grocery market. Plus, I called the company to ask if there was anything I could do to change to the bigger size, or if they even carried them for future purposes, and I heard NOTHING back.But the delivery (although not what I wanted) was prompt and it came with a free bottle of salad dressing."
1,"The low, low point in a slow, steady decline","Sex, eroticism, passion . . . with a corpse.Despite Anita Blake's ealier revulsion with ""sex with a corpse"" she nevertheless spends about 30 pages engaged in such with Jean-Claude.Honestly, this book has none of the charm and the supernatural thrills of the first books, but rather reflects a climax of Laurell K. Hamilton's slow and steady descent into eroticism from day one.Don't expect to see new supernatural creatures like the Naga, Bloody Bones, or even Voodoo witches in this one, kids. In fact, it's one really long tale of Anita Blake's trials and tribulations deciding between Jean-Claude and Richard.Honestly, I loved these books, and this was the one that made me stop reading the series."
2,Wrong choice,"I'm pissed now that I already ordered the next two books in the series. I have been loving them, and I was waiting for Anita to get over herself and do it with Richard. Instead, she does it with Jean-Claude. What the wtf? She's a killer and doesn't feel anything about it, and so is Jean Claude. She has no moral high ground to stand on, but she is so freaked out by seeing Richard eat a mouthful of Marcus that she goes running home to have sex with a killer, murderous vampire? I was disgusted by the ending, and I'm not at all sure that I will read the next two books when they come.The book was great up until the ending, but her sleeping with Jean Claude and dumping Richard ruins the entire series."
2,Dissapointing,"Up until ""Killing Dance"" I very truly LOVED the Anita Blake Series. However, now I am severly dissapointed with the direction this book has taken the series. The actions (primarily regarding the Richard/Jean-Claude situation) committed by the female lead do not follow with the character that has been built up over the previous novels. Anita Blake exhibits a 'coldness' not seen before. If her relationship with Richard had to be dissolved, I'm sure there was a better way to handle it.This book has essentially soured my feeling towards the Anita Blake Series, in general. I can no longer say that I am a fan. I truly hope that future books repair the damage done by ""Killing Dance""."
2,Fast read!,"This was the first of this genre that I read. Anita Blake's name kept coming up in reviews and I thought I would give this one a try. I loved Anita! But does the girl ever have a chance to relax? Thought the book was hot but not steamy. It was not a waste of time, but I probably won't read another one of its kind."
2,Product description was a lie!,"This book was not new in any way....Pages are discolored, some even have holes in them from a cat! The spine of the book has been worn and creased. They need to not label their stuff as ""new"" when it clearly isn't."
3,adding to collection,Having read most of the Anita Blake books I wanted to read the ones I missed. Reading the first time Anita makes love with Jean-Claude was most interesting.
4,Good advice to Dad's; from a women doctor...,"This was the best book I have read regarding how to be a father to girls. I attribute this to the fact the advice comes from a women first and a psychologist second. Dr. Meeker keeps saying things like, ""she may not think she wants you to, but she does""... This is now my mantra when giving boundaries to my daughters that are met with protest. I especially liked the chapter on protecting them and being affectionate toward them."
3,"Valuable advices, but it is over alarmist - it could be more balanced...","Great book, great advices. I really recommend dads and moms to read this book. It has all the good answers you are looking for, which are applicable to girls of all ages (it could see myself applying them to my 2 years old daughter and my 26 years old sister).My big frustration with this book is that it is over alarmist and plays too much with statistics, trying to convince dads to take ownership of their daughters education. The problem is that if you got to the point of bothering to read such a book, it is obvious that you care!! I found it useful at the beginning, it gave reason for my concerns, but when she pounds you in the head with the same story over and over, it gets tiring and frustrating. Almost quit reading, but the advices are too good and I kept going.I would rate it 5 stars if it was more balanced."
1,Strictly for GOP voters,"I ordered this book on a recommendation. I wish I'd read the reviews.If you vote GOP and consider yourself a Christian conservative, this book is probably for you.If not, skip it.Beyond her strong ideological bias, Meg Meeker is scientifically illiterate. She quotes numerous study results of correlations as though they were causations. it's an appalling, albeit common practice -- but it's also a sign she slept through her epidemiology class."
5,Fathers please read this book,As a father of two girls this book shows you what your actions do to the little girls who watch and learn from everything you do. You owe it to your daughters to read this book. It really opens your eyes. And it tells you a few things you don't want to hear but really need to. I'm glad I read it I hope you do.
5,Awesome book!,"This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. As a daughter of a dad who did a great job and as someone who works with adolescent girls, I wish that every dad would read this book. It will inspire and encourage you...and probably scare you a little bit, too, once you realize just how important you are to your daughter's future."
1,First time I have disliked a book enough to write a review,"This book is more about the author's politics then about how to be a better father. While she and I are on the same side politically, I bought the book to get parenting advice and not hear the author rant on about conservative viewpoint.I found it to be a huge waste of time, with really no insight to how I can be a better parent for my daughter."
1,A very one-dimensional view of parenting.,"My interpretation of this book is that it is a very close minded look at fatherhood from a mother's perspective. The author seems to think that the only way of raising a daughter is how she was raised. She warns in so many words that if you stray too far from her ideals, you are exposing your daughter to danger, and setting her up for failure. There are some cmon sense points of some value, but little practical parenting guidance. Her anecdotes are often a little too neat and tidy to seem real."
4,Good book,"i got this book after seeing a post on facebook about how good it was. It does have some good suggestions and does make any dad realize how your daughter really needs you. Best of all, amazon got it to me fast! I would recommend this book to all fathers regardless of how old your daughter is."
2,way too conservative and religious,"There is some useful information in the book but the author is way too religious and conservative, and she preaches her own beliefs rather than scientific information."
3,Have you hugged your daughter today?,"Meeker dedicates one chapter per ""secret"" fathers should know. She espouses traditional values and includes many sobering statistics. Statistics such as how many teenaged girls are depressed, struggle with eating disorders, use drugs or alcohol, and have sex. Her book is best read prior to becoming a father. It may induce huge guilt if read too late. Her encouragement on things like hugging your teenaged daughters is probably necessary today. Calming, reassuring, but deadly serious in its intent."
5,Good Book,My husband heard about this book and wanted it. So I bought it for him. He really likes this book. Very helpful.
5,Good book!,Really liked book and gave to my daughter's father. He has left the family and never had a close relationship with his daughters. Was hoping it would make their relationship better.
5,A must read for Dads and Moms!,Dr. Meeker gives incredible advice on raising daughters. There is so much useful information in this book. A must read.
4,"A Haunting, Powerful Collection","This book is terrific: elegant yet plain-spoken, learned yet deeply human. Many of these poems sound like a straight-shot out of Whitman, but then they are counterbalanced with tender, quiet lyrics with the tone and delicacy of James Wright. As Wright himself put it, this is the poetry of a grown man. In a time of so much ironic, self-conscious writing, this is that rare thing: a book of sincere, heart-breaking beauty."
1,WHY MARVEL ? WHY?,"First of all, i'm a big spider-man fan. I've been collecting comics since pre-school. Torment was one of the few comics thati didn't collect. That probably happened for a reason. Man, this comic was horrible. Two things were wrong with it. The first thing is the art. If you compare it to the art at that time, it's pretty @#!$#$. The second thing is the story line. I was baffeled at how cocky and stupid spider-man was. Then all of sudden spider-man changes to a foot loose guy to something like a torutured hero, it seems like a reflection of spawn's TORMENTED soul. Since i bought it, i had to force himself to go through reading it. If you want to save yourself 17.99 then don't buy this comic. In the end you'll just get pissed off and be down 18 bucks."
5,A true masterpiece by a true master.,"Spider-man Torment set the tone for what Todd McFarlane was capable of doing on his own. This story is the result of McFarlane's brilliant artwork and equally icredible script.McFarlane brings new life into an old villain: The Lizzard. The Lizzard however is under the spell of a mysterious character. Will these two bring and end to our hero Spider-man? Well, it sertainly looked like it!!"
2,Better resources on-line,"This book was a real disappointment. I doesn't cover all the features of CVS and lacks detailed examples. I've found better (and free) documentation on the web. Also, with the release of CVS 1.11, this book is slightly out of date. The authors spend more time covering topics like Open Source development and why you should design for portability instead of showing how you can use CVS to manage a really large software project. While they discuss the mechanics of branching, they don't cover things like branching strategies."
3,this game is okay,"this game is reallly hard to beat. i got it a couple days ago and i can't even beat the first level. the graphics are okay, not great though. the guns are cool, but the people are messed up sometimes. so if you are very good at first-person shooter games buy it. but if you are not, consider buying another game."
2,Don't do it!!!,"I've reviewed and own over 30 PC games from the past year, all first person shooters. Let me tell you this has to be the worst of the worst that I've played.The graphics are pretty cool, but the game play is horrendous. It's extremely difficult, and my computer can barely keep up with the speed that it all moves at.Good idea, poor execution of that idea. The ONLY redeemable quality of this game is the price. I bought it when it was twice as much, which is why I was more disappointed. If your really bored, go for it, but Ghost Recon and Max Payne are only a few bucks more and are top FPS's. Good luck.For reference...I ran this game on a P 4 2.8ghz with 512 MB RDRAM and a Geforec 4 Ti 4600 and STILL had video lag.Did I mention Soldier of Fortune II?? Now THATS a shooter."
1,Finnicky installation; no support,"After ensuring that my system exceeds not only the ""minimum,"" but also the ""recommended"" requirements, I installed it. Got a ""Client Error"" message. Activision's website acknowledges the problem and recommends turning off all other processes (including firewall & virus protection!). Did that. Still got the error message, so I contacted the tech support e-mail account. That was 10 days ago, but I still haven't received a reply. Phone support isn't offered during evenings or weekends, either.Sluggish and choppy graphics may be bothersome, but software that just doesn't work is a real pain."
3,Not much for the price,"I just got my bag and was surprised at how small it is...and it's not even waterproof. In my opinion, it is not worth $30. You can buy the Seal Line Sea Bags for much less. They are waterproof and can be stored in the kayak or buckled to the top. I plan to use my Ziptop Deck Bag to house a small first aid kit (waterproof). That's about all it will hold."
3,Good Story,"With the pending release of this film, I got into the Daredevil world, reading old and new comics with much interest. This title was brought to my attention by some other fans. It is a little hyped, but it contains a good solid story, and some interesting characters, especially 'Nuke'. I still cannot grasp the extent of Daredevil's world, as he at times is a mere mortal with just a slight advantage on other men, and at other times he is a near invulnerable hero on par with Spiderman and Batman. Daredevil takes some getting used to, if not a direct effort to like."
1,daredevil: born again,"the book came in TERRIBLE condition...very disappointed....pages bent, ripped and smudged. awful awful"
5,Dottie West - Greatest Hits,"I had not listened to Dottie West music in years. I was greatly pleased with the condition of the CD, as I boughtit used. I would recommend this CD to any country music fan.."
3,Not a bad product,"The transmitter works as it is supposed to, but the interference I get spoils the quality of audio to the point where I don't really enjoy listening to music. I don't know whether this is a problem with all FM based transmitters or specific to this one.This one works out ok for me because I use it mainly to listen to audiobooks so don't particularly care about audio quality."
5,Wow! Amazing Talent! Super Concert! Captivating!!!,"I bought this DVD tonight at BestBuy and came home intending to watch a few minutes of it, as I also purchased a movie as well. Needless to say, I was taken by all the beautiful music and watched the entire concert. Superb sound quality, each instrument in true purity. I felt like I was there on stage, listening close-up to Jamie and his band! I've never beed a true die-hard jazz fan, other than I love Nancy Wilson's songs, voice and style. Now Jamie has opened the door to jazz once again with his voice, style and composition of each beautiful song. He points out that jazz is alive and doing well and entering the pop scene today. How true! I know I will watch this concert many times and show it to my friends. You will not go wrong purchasing this work of a truly great artist and his music. Thank you Jamie!"
5,pc game,"My grandson loves this game, he is able to make maps of his own and he is loving it. I have played also, and it is a fun shooter game."
4,blast the helllike blood outta them,so maybe its not as cool as the other ones but hay its still a doom game so you gotta buy it
2,It's not for children,"This game is fun if you like shooters but it is very violent and gory so it's not for kids. I believe that there is a bit too many ""decorations"" (ex. dead guys and severed limbs).The graphics are good, and the animation is acceptable. But once you play a few of the missions it becomes boring. If you like to kill it's the right game for you. You may find yourself stranded in one area of the map if you don't find the keycard. Sometimes it's just too complicated for a 3d shooter.Overall it's okay."
5,Must-Read for Software Project Managers and Executives,"DeMarco and Lister take a scholarly approach to some of the most important questions revolving around software project management. This book is full of references to real-life studies and examples, and does not rely on common-sense or assumption. What are the factors that influence the success or failure of software projects? Read this book in order to find out, and you'll have a facts-based tool chest that you can use to look for and solve potential problems in your future projects, before they even arise."
1,Focus on people in the IT workplace,"This book expends too much effort to make a case that IT professionals are deprived of appropriate facilities if they don't have cubicles with 100 sq ft of floor space and floor-to-ceiling walls with a door. FWIW I survived quite well for many years as a Software Engineer with half that amount of floor space with five-foot walls and no door. I felt confortable and the outside noise was minimal. Also, I was able to stand up and see the daylight any time that I wanted."
5,A really great book.,"This book has lots of solid information about what makes software developers do a good job. Some of the information is really thought provoking. Some is just a very clear way of saying -- and logically proving -- things that you already know.The general philosophy in the book is that software developers want to do a good job. The job of the manager is to create conditions where the developers can do a good job.The book have 2 - 3 chapters that I will try to get my bosses to read, because they pinpoint our problems so precisely. Other chapters are about aspects that luckily are not problems for us.The book is really easy to read. Once I started I could not stop. Still the individual chapters describe different aspects and can be read separately.I will invest some money in a better work situation by buying this book as a Christmas gift for my boss. I just hope that the boss will read it."
5,An absolutely MUST READ,"This book was recommended to me by the finest manager I've ever had the pleasure of working for. After reading it, I realized what set him apart was that he applied the principals described by DeMarco and Lister and what a difference it made! After reading it, I bought two more copies, one for my current boss and one for another developer. Both were heard singing its praises to their bosses. The book is good enough that it they either bought it for their bosses or handed their own copy to them. You can't get a much better recommendation than that."
4,"Peopleware : Productive Projects and Teams, 2nd Ed.",Tom Demarco in this book shows us what a great insight he has in terms of what are some of the key factors that can help as well as hinder software development teams/projects. Having worked as a software developer for 10+ years I can really relate to what Demarco says (unfortunately this is not always a good thing!).
5,Love It!,"This was bought as a gift for my son, who refurbishes autos and recreational vehicles for resale. He loves it! It's very heavy duty and does a great job!"
2,740 PARK,"This book is the very definition of over rated..how on earth do you have a book like this and no images of these supposed fantastic apartments, I suggest a book on the architects of this building, Rosario Candela and James Carpenter, now that will show you the famous Rockefeller apartment, and fyi, it's a fantastic book, this book on the other hand is inane dribble...what a bore."
5,Very good album,"I'm korean The ""sad eyes"" is my favorite song.. But I can't buy this album in Korea..... ""sad eye"" is so good ,the voice is very soft."
3,Interesting...,"I loved Sad Eyes. I never know who sang it until I did a little research and came up with Robert John. Then I found out this guy quit singing to become a producer. He had a little bit of success, producing AC/DC, Foreigner, Bryan Adams, Def Leppard, and some hot chick named Shania Twain, who he then married. His full name is Robert John ""Mutt"" Lange."
1,Less in Never More,"I bought this Cd's based on the reviews in this page and , well ... There is nothing like the Real Thing . Hackett was a very important member of Genesis from Nursery to Seconds Out , but this renditions of Genesis Classics are like a bad Hollywood Comercial . I already gave them away . I was lucky to see Genesis from Selling England to Seconds out and Wow . But this ... well , as I wrote : Less is Never More ..."
5,Superb,satoshi had always got his very own style is progressive house...this album is a must get...excellent piece of music
1,You may be Sorry,"After 2 years the burners are having to be replaced....they have caroded and the grill is no longer safe. Frigidaire ""electrolux"" customer service is awful someone in India just apologizes, but doesn't want to do anything to help. Think Twice before you spend this kind of money."
2,Upsetting,"By the time this album came out the Suicide Machines were in a good place. They had two solid releases to their name, a solid fan base, and national exposure. Why they would put all that at risk for momentary gain is beyond me, but that is exactly what they did. This album sounds very awkward and unsure of itself with a punk/ska band attempting to play songs that would become high school prom staples. A new listener might find it to be alright as it definately does have its moments, but it is impossible for anyone who has followed this great band's career to listen to this album and not be disappointed."
2,Just not the Suicide Machines,"I just can't believe they did this. Don't get me wrong; I would recommend Destruction by Definition and Battle Hymns to any fan of punk. But this? Come on! The only song I can listen to is Permanent Holiday; the rest are just not what I was looking for. And you can't blame me! After releasing two energy-packed, ultra-punk, great CDs, you would think they would stick to the formula; I have no problem with bands trying something new. It's only when they try something new and it [stinks] do I have a problem. In any event, I guess I'll sell this CD to a pop-lover, and keep listening to their other two CDs, which in my opinion are punk rock classics."
2,Changing with the Times?,"I now realize why Derrek Grant, The SM's incredible drummer, left the band before recording this album. Give the SM's credit for always keeping their albums fresh. This could have been a good or even great album be it power-pop or rap. But this album reflects little effort by the band in their usually great songwriting. The drumming is now straight forward, the melodies generic, and the lyrics mindless. But, THEY STILL ROCK!"
3,"Less hardcore, but still a good CD","Hey kidz,The new album is more poppy and not as hardcore as the others. Fans who really like the band may welcome the new sound (think Blink 182) but hardcore fans may call this one a sellout. Overall, a good disc."
2,ARRRRRRGGGH!,"Where are the real Suicide Machines? These guys should have changed thier name along with thier style. I would like this album a whole lot more if the Suicide Machines hadn't put thier name on the cover. The only fast song is ""I never promised you a rose garden"" and it's a cover song! When I first put in the CD I realized that I had heard the first song on the radio and didn't even realize it. The Suicide Machines have sold out and committed credibility suicide. They've even taken most of the profanity out of their lyrics. When did these guys get so mellow?"
2,It could be any boring pseudo-punk band,"The sound and the songs that made the Machines unique and special (as can be heard on their excellent 'Destruction By Definition') are nowhere to be found on this album. Instead, this CD is full of utterly uninspiring throwaway tracks that could have been done by any number of today's briefly-famous-but-God-knows-why bands. The one track that made me smile was the punk-like remake of the old Lynn Anderson tune 'I Never Promised You A Rose Garden' (The original version of which I remember hearing played regularly on my AM radio long ago.) Cute, but by itself not nearly enough reason to cause anyone but the most undiscriminating listener to buy this disappointing CD. If this were a fish you just caught, I'd recommend you throw it back - it's not very good eatin'."
1,It's Trash even if you dont like Punk,"This album is terrible. I'm sorry but there's no other way to put it. I was so excited when they came out with this album, I raced to the record store to buy it. Luckily I was in a place that let me listen to it first. This cd is so bland and dry it makes R.E.M. seem exciting. (That was borrowed from another reviewer--it is the truth) The novelty song ""Sometimes I Dont Mind"" is pretty fun to listen to but otherwise this album has no emotion, no energy, and is not at all interesting. After listening to this, I seriously felt sick to my stomach.Also, like someone else said, I could not believe it was the same band-- I had to make sure it wasn't some other band with the same name to believe it. Terrible, just terrible.Forget the whole debate of whether they sold out or not (Who really cares anyway??) this album is simply unenjoyable to listen to and that's all there is to it."
4,If you're serious about,"Allthough very explainatory this is not a book for everyone who whishes to learn Japanese. Unlike most other language books this one does not start with learning you common simple phrases. Instead it requires you to dig in to the structure of Japanese. But it does so without leaving out any necessary steps in understanding what is going on.If you already know some phrases, you can ask your way around in a shop etc. and want to start learning the linguistic structures of Japanese I'd recommend this book. If you're an absolute beginner or if you're not sure how serious you are about learning Japanese, chose a phrase book first and then if you still think it's fun, get this one.Olof, Halmstad, Sweden"
3,Science Fiction Storytelling,"This documentary, ""The Alien Time Machine: Encounters from another Dimension"" features Terry le Riche Walters, well-known for his extraterrestrial beliefs. It is evident throughout the film that Walters clearly knows how to tell a good story. He discusses his encounters with aliens and his psychic powers quite candidly, which hints at believability. While he seems like a genuine fellow, I couldn't help but see him as a character, albeit an entertaining and enjoyable character. Footage of the time machine mentioned in the title is shown but it's really up to the viewer to decide how much of this film is legitimate and how much is pure entertainment."
2,Financial Institutions Don't Like it,"I purchased this software with the intention of writing my business plan for my start-up. The software was very helpful in fleshing out the ideas for my new business with the step by step process. However, the stubling block came when I submitted my business plan to my financial institution; they don't like it. My loan officer and I spent many hours making corrections and getting the document properly formatted for submission to underwriting.I did get approved, but in the future I will only use the software for structuring the document and will do all the numerical calculations in a separate spreadsheet and import the data."
4,Dirty Water another Boston punk band,"This EP is short, very fast paced. If you are a fan of early Dropkick Murphys or of the Street Dogs this is for you."
1,Did Not Work At All.,"Did not look like it was damaged during shipping, but nothing happened when I plugged it in. Checked fuse per trouble-shooting instructions, but it looked fine and still nothing. I was trying to use it in addition to the Chauvet strobe light to get better syncing to music with it's audio feature. No dice for me!"
1,"Dosen't work, no customer service","I got the strobe controller and found that the only functioning mode that worked with the strobe light (specificly made from chauvet) was the audio option. The other 2 simply have no response from the strobe light. I tried numerouse different customer service numbers and all of them said that the offices were closed, I tried at least 10 times thinking it was just bad timing, but still no luck. Very dissapointed. For any help or ideas please comment"
2,don't buy this,"this product works well, doing three simple tasks, but is impossible to mount in a rack due to it's weird half unit size and the fact that it doesn't have standard rack measurements or drilled holes to mount it properly. my suggestion would be to buy a full sized rack unit that installs properly."
1,telfon fibric protector,i want to learn the producer of the telfon protecor of garment so please tell me some main producer of doing the telfon procted fibric if it is possible
2,"Miserable, compared to Black White and Red or Devil by Deed","This is alternate future story about one boy who should inherit the throne of Earth and how he got betrayed by his mother. Robocop wannabe called Grendel Prime saves him and they journey away from chasers that were sent after him. It has elements of sci fi movies of early nineties, think Terminator and so on. The stage is set in your typical Mad Max/Judge Dredd future.Maybe it was great for people who were teenagers when it was published, but I searched it so much and got dissapointed in the end."
5,Best holiday classroom projects,"As a teacher, I can use every one of these projects in the classroom! In particular, the projects for Kwanzaa are a rare find. GREAT BOOK"
4,Fair for the price!,"I've been working in radio broadcasting for about 6 years in my life..so when I'm telling you this is a decent deal, you should trust me.Given the price, the sound of the MXL 990 and 991 is more than fair..is more than I expected.With a bit of touch you can capture instruments and voice like a pro.I would say 90-95% ..you are there.Since these mics require phantom power, be sure you have your mixer equipped with phantom power or buy a pre-amp that has one.Also you will probably need a tripod as well.Don't be cheap on cables - bad ones can pickup ground noise or other noise..if possible use balanced connections between your mixer and your computer..(if that's what you using for recording).Other than that..warm, round sound..you have to play with them until you get your perfect sound.I rarely give 5 star to a product, that's the reason for 4 out of 5.I've been using them to capture acoustic guitar and voice."
4,Great deal but be aware ...,"Both of these microphones require a 48-volt phantom power supply that, unless your mixer provides for such, would have to be purchased separately.For some, it could really be frustrating to receive something that you have been waiting for, only to find out that you can't use it right out of the box. So make sure that any mixer you intend to use these with has switchable +48V phantom power and preferrably with an indicator.Actually I didn't give a five-stars rating due to this lack of information. I think the manufacturer and/or the merchant should specifically state things like this in its product description, so at least customers would know what to expect in advance.As for the mics, I believe they perform well over other products within this price range. I use a SoundCraft console so maybe that's a plus, but overall I'd say the mics are well worth the price."
5,"Finally, Some Responsible Scholarship","Strauss brings a rational evaluation to a din of screaming paranoid voices. If you've heard that NIV isn't really a Bible, or that it's updated version (NIVI) is really a feminist plot, RUN, don't walk, to purchase this book. Strauss makes clear to readers of any education level how translations work, how they come about, and why responsible scholarship keeps it's head when confronted with social change. Strauss is no feminist either: he's a traditional roles kinda guy, so to hear him discuss and advocate responsible inclusivist translations speaks volumes. When you've read this book, you'll be ready to read your Bible responsibly on this topic."
1,Horrible threads in the studs,"Sorry to say this is the second official Gibson part that has rated the bottom of the barrel. The threads on the adjustment studs were covered in burs and forced into the barrel bushings. I had to use a pair of channel locks to hold the bushing and a quarter to unscrew it. And this is the way both studs were right out of the package.Also note the picture on this page seems to show the bushings as gold, they are plain steel. but since they go in the body it doesnt show much anyway. but if the threads on the studs and bushings is typical i wouldn't recommend this product to anyone"
2,eagle sunrise tunnel tepees,the important thing on this tepees tunnel is the plastic pipe rods which holds the tunnel....very cheap material used to buld that.......kids play like kids ...not like disable kids ...they need to put stronger rods to hold that
3,Fits my current Nyko charging station,"The batteries in this particular set are giving me trouble that I didn't have with my original purchase. They fit on the charging station, but the batteries are lighter and drain much more quickly than the ones that I purchased over a year ago. Other than that this is a great buy for a family that uses their Wii all the time."
1,Battery Damaged,"This is for the rechargeable batteries.I bought the charging dock and an additional batery because for now I have 3 Wii remotes, only my husband and I deal with the recharging... and for some reason one of the batteries is not charging anymore, we put it on the charging dock and the light turns green after a few seconds. We are very disappointed."
4,Not enough battery life,I like the fact that this is a rechargeable battery. I don't have to buy batteries anymore. But they claim to get 25 hours of playing time. I bearly got 10 out of one charge. But I would still buy this again. Good for the environment.
4,Wii battery kit,I needed a rechargeable battery and cover for the Wii controller. I found it here at amazon for a cheap price and it also arrived quickly. If you need one of thes I would reccomend getting it here.
1,What am I doing wrong???,"I see everyone giving a good rating for this product. I bought it, put it in my third remote and put it on the charging station. It wont charge. Im bummed about it. I cant figure out why it wont charge. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated."
1,"Doesn't work with magnetic ""IC"" bases...","Don't order this battery if you have the charge station that is ""IC."" They are the bases where the remote does not sit in the base, rather it is ""suspended"" on the dock by some kind of magnetic capability. I got two to these and they were worthless, fortunately, Amazon was fantastic to work with and refunded my money without my having to ship them back. Thanks Amazon."
1,misleading description - will not work with induction chargers,Deceptive merchandising - states that it will work with all Nyko chargers. I thought that my kids were charging it wrong but it simply will not work with an induction charger. Very disappointed.
4,Wii batteries,I purchased these batteries once before this time and they have held up very with all the use they get.I got a quick shipment on this order but have not put them into use at this time. I am sure they are as good as the ones I am still using.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R9A9JG/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
5,Wii Battery Kit,Great product. Lasts a long time. Multi colours are really helpful when a family is playing.
2,Not worth the money,First off I should let you guys know that I own 6 of these. Yes thats right 6. I had to buy 2 replacments for batteries. I originaly purchases these and the charge station back in 08. Currenlty it's year 11. Only 1 battery has managed to survive. If you don't use the batteries fairly offen they just go stale. The only one left that still works for me is the P1 conroller battery. Here are some Pros & ConsCons*Colors are random.*Some batteries don't live as long as others.*Must recharge frequenlty. (or prior to gameplay)*Have to move it around on the charger to get charge to take.*If not used offen batteries that get removed after playing are cheaper. (I use doller store batteries in mine now)Pros*If used offen saves money on batteries.*Adds a collored back strip to your controller to help distinguish your controllers from friends.*Charge simply by putting on charger.
5,"Eye Opening, Heart Awakening film","This film is one of the most beautiful documentaries that i have ever seen in my life. It is about a tribe that lives in the high peaks of the sierra nevada mountain range in santa marta columbia. This tribe holds the origional wisdoms of nature, they practice an impeccable spiritual arts created to sustain harmony with the great creator mother earth. Even if you are not a spiritual person, the way that the shamans of this tribe...aka MAMA's speak will touch your heart and give you something so beautiful to take with you into your life...For those that are spiritual this film has the potential to connect you directly to perhaps what you have been inwardly seeking for a long time, which is a full harmonious connnection to the divine...HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended movie!!"
3,"Interesting material, but dreadful organization","This book covers a lot of information which could be done quite interestingly. However, its organization leaves so much to be desired that I was very disappointed in the book. It covers things like dimensional analysis and the effect of choice of units on physical formulas, as well as the history of units (as promised in the title), but it jumps from topic to topic in a chaotic manner, with topics that are closely related scattered among different chapters and things that ought to be separated lumped together in one chapter.Another reviewer talked of the errors in some of the equations in this book. They are there, but I don't think that this is the biggest problem with this book. Rather, it is the totally incomprehensible lack of any sensible organization."
5,A Wonderful Work of Quality Literary Fiction,"East and West, dark and light, mental anguish and psychological survival, dreams and sleep told in language that both sings and paints, carry this story of two-half sisters, a world apart, from the murky fog of memory, both stolen and real, into the light of wakefulness and truth.For me, the best kind of writing is strong and delicate, and allows the reader to discover the story with all its nuances, meanings and metaphors. Krygier's writing employs this kind of delicate strength as her characters deal with the aftermath of the Vietnam War and illustrate how it became part of our American DNA. When She Sleeps, by Leora Krygier, is a must-read for all people who savor language, read with depth and enjoy the discovery of a new favorite author."
3,"some good suggestions, but basically says control yourself and don't scream","The take-away message I got from this book was that the key to Scream-Free parenting was to just control your owm emotions, show you are in control and expect results. But this is hader said than done, especially with a 2 1/2 year old and I could use a lot more specific suggestions.Also bought Have a new kid by Friday (felt As Seen on TV gimmicky, this will work for you if you just use my method...) and How to talk so your kids will listen and listen so your kids will talk (much more helpful but a little out-of-date).Hasn't helped me that much."
4,Love it,Love the book. It makes a lot of sense. It's great when you're in the heat of the moment and you remember some of the stuff you read and put it in action.
1,Not Impressed,"OK, I bought and read ScreamFree Parenting and have to say I was unimpressed. He really does not give you any ""action oriented"" parenting advice and I could probably boil the book down to a few bullet points:1. Work on keeping yourself calm in the face of children melting down.2. Give them latitude to be themselves, learn privacy, and make better choices (read very much like free-spirit parenting of the 60's, including suggestions that you allow your teenage daughter to have boys in her room with the door closed, because you trust her and respect her privacy -- yeah, right).3. Force children to suffer consequences for their decisions, even if it's difficult for you, as the parent, to follow through with those consequences.I can't say I would recommend this to anyone -- even getting a library copy would be a stretch, as there are much better parenting books available."
3,Scream free parenting,Make no mistake. This author will not tell you how to raise your kids. The guidance is very round-the-block. Not one of the most enlightening books. Maybe because we don't scream that much!
4,"Excellent, but not for the faint of heart","This is an excellent translation, but if your Irish is not tip-top, this can be a tough and sometimes frustrating read. I eventually bit the bullet and got an English-language copy from the library to read along with it, which made for a much more satisfying (and educational!) experience."
4,"Really good book, well written, review by Mrs. B. Chitty","I really enjoyed this book. The story grabs you from the very first page. From the moment a computer hacker is beheaded by a cunning, computer assisted demon until the very end, Browning creates page turning suspense. The author's characters are vivid, right down to Pam, the strong willed ""warrior woman"" who battles the crafty and very formidable villain, Verstig to Kevin and Thomas who are transported to different ""enclaves."" The novel was action packed as well, never a dull moment....it was Indiana Jones meets the internet age and the Exorcist. Cobras, mambas, all kinds of magic....it would also please X-files fans as well. I would highly recommend this story. It's well crafted, and Browning's writing has a really nice flow to it. I would write more about the plot, but I wouldn't want to spoil it for the reader. Read this book, and enjoy."
1,Disappointing and not worth purchasing,"The description of this as a ""multisensory approach"" with ""practice tests and activities"" and ""various levels of activity"" seemed promising. However, the information offered in this CD was very simplistic. There were some pictures, in slide-show fashion, to go along with the words - and someone's boring voice reading the words... but very little information was offered to explain the pictures. No historical information about the source of the art, etc. The amount of historical information provided in any part of the CD was scant. At best, this is a cursory overview. There were NO activities that I could find, other than basic quizzes. Age 6-11 is an exaggeration for sure. I would give this an age 5-6 for an average child."
5,Tanner Ties,This was a great book. I liked that Luke was worked into the series. I was blown away about the fact that 'Buck's friend was the bad guy.
4,Decent file with comfortable grip,"I bought this particular file to be used solely for sharpening my mower blade, and it has done that well. The handle is comfortable, but I will add that the file has a tendency to become loose. Still, it's worth the $7 that I paid for it."
2,I agree with all the other reviewers...,"I was very disappointed with the layout of this book. If I choose to refer to it I become obsessed with the precision of the blocks, the very thing Sears advises against. Also, it would be nice if the book differentiated between favorable and unfavorable carbs.PASS ON THIS ONE! END"
4,Zone Food Blocks is the BEST Zone book out there,"Zone Food BLocks is the most helpful book Barry Sears has written so far. The layout of the book helps the most clueless people on what they should and should not eat and how much of it they should/shouldnt not eat. IF you are already sold on the Zone lifestyle then skip buyingthe other Zone Books and purchase this one. Like it says, ""It's the Quick, Easy Guide to Staying in the Zone"""
4,This works,"No complex application, just dab it on the affected area regularly and watch the razor bumps disappear (over time of course) I think I noticed a difference in about a week maybe?Anyway, I always keep this in supply."
4,A Special Workforce of Nuts,"Southwest's very non-formal, non-traditional, non-business way of doing business. How do you turn a profit in an industry that has never turned a profit but is vital to our economy? The answer is different from every other company in the industry. This book is a must read for anyone who is in charge of projects or people. Southwest encourages creativity and is the most flexible company in the airline industry which alows them to adapt to situations much like their pasenger turn around time, record breaking. Of course it helps when your employees literally luv their work."
4,"Useful for any industry, great information","The thing I really enjoyed about this book was how universal the advice is and can be used for any business. Yes, it was very interesting to see how Herb took an industry and turned it upside down. And it was great to read how the originators of Southwest squeezed out so many inefficiencies but the real valuable part of this book was how to treat employees. So many great examples of how to treat your employees well and get them engaged in the succes of the company. Even though this book is getting old, you still see a better employee at Southwest airlines. In summary, this is a great book to pull out some tips to improve your own business and it's also a great way to reevaluate your relationship with your employees."
5,An Excellent Read About An Amazing and Innovative Company,"One of the most refreshing books on succesful American companies. Southwest Airlines has created a recipe for success by being innovative and placing great value on its customers and employees. Its philosophy has nade them a respected employer and a major force in the airline industry. ""Do what you love and success will follow!"""
2,Wish someone had told me.....,"I bought Davinci furniture for my first baby and have loved the furniture....and of course the changing pad came with the table. I was a little disappointed with it because it was kind of flimsy and the pad cover I'd purchased didn't fit at all! So we just winged it and I usually put a towel down for changings. The plastic material ripped pretty easily and I'm finally chunking it after 18 months of use. I just purchased a LA Baby Babyluxe changing pad as a replacement and it fits perfectly (even with the odd dimensions) and was WAY cheaper than the Davinci replacements I could find. It's also a little sturdier, so it works better with a cover.Also, if you're looking for a changing pad cover to fit this odd size look up ""American Baby 13x17 changing pad cover"" on Amazon....fits this flat and odd size pad like a glove!"
3,A slice of life story,"What I call a ""slice of life"" story is not generally my favorite kind of fiction. Often I keep reading because I'm waiting for a major plot line to climax-- which it sometimes doesn't. This book fits into this category. However, it is well written and pretty interesting. Character development is thorough- in fact an entire lengthy chapter is devoted to each character. I did care about the family, and thought the location (western MO) would be interesting since that's where I live, but really, this story could have been set in any rural middle American location."
1,Smells REALLY bad,"This bag has an extremely strong odor that smells horrible. I've had other leather bags that had a slight leathery smell, but this smells like a pile of dead animals soaked in industrial chemicals. (Which is what leather is, but it doesn't usually smell like that.)When the package arrived, I was able to smell the odor from 15 feet away. That's when it was still inside a sealed plastic bag, inside the box. When I took it out, the odor was overwhelming and repulsive. I thought it would air out in a few minutes, but all it did was make my office smell horrible. I made the mistake of handling it, and it took me about 20 minutes of washing my hands to get the smell off them.I immediately packed it back up to send it back, but had to leave the box in my car overnight. I got rid of the package the next day (apologizing profusely to the post office staff), but my car still smelled like that for days.I don't know what they've put on this bag that smells so bad, but it is disgusting."
5,excellent,"I use the bag as a gym bag. Excellent quality -- soft leather, convenient zipppered compartments, and big enough to hold my gym clothes and stuff."
2,Not so great...,We got this and have not used any of it. Part of that may be that our 6 month old still doesn't have a lot of hair. We had to buy a better nail clipper than the one included.
4,"Kit has everything, scissors aren't sharp enough though","This is a nice kit to have since it contains everything you need. The scissors that are included with the kit aren't great for cutting really small nails though. I got a pair from another company to leave as a spare in the diaper bag and now I only use those.But, its still a great set, and since its not very expensive its a nice baby present if you just need something small to give someone."
4,Great product- but get it bundled in System Mechanic Pro,"This is a great product that will recover files not only on your hard drive, but also in your camera and memory stick. It also has an ""incinerate"" feature to truly destroy files. However, you will get more for your money if you buy IOLO System Mechanic Pro- it contains Search and Recover 2 as well as Kapersky Firewall and Antivirus and a few other useful utilities. Just don't use the disk defragmenter that comes with it- it sucks!"
2,What happened to the footage from the VHS????????????,"I love this DVD, don't get me wrong, but there was WAY MORE footage on the VHS tape. Where is the footage of Ozzy talking about killing his wife when he was drunk. There was also a lot more footage of Randy Rhoads and Ozzy talking about his death. Did that all disappear or what? I'm not trying to be morbid or anything, but why would that stuff be taken out??????????"
4,A Must Have For Ozzy Enthusiasts.,"This DVD is an excellent overview of Ozzy's life and career. Aside from ""No More Tears"", the songs listed on the package are not complete videos. Rather, each track is pieced together with the story and blends very well. Technically speaking, this DVD is in Dolby 5.1 and sounds great. The bonus materials consist of a written biography and discography.I have been a huge Ozzy fan for years and this is the best biography I have seen on the man. A definite must for Ozzy and Sabbath fans. I have been annoyed by the poor quality of other music DVDs, however, this one really surprised me. It really is that good."
1,Pure Junk,This junk is not even worth the paper it is printed on. Why is junk like this even printed in the first place. Nothing but childish and clueless meandering proving that a mind is a terrible thing to waste.
1,Looks Are Decieving,I recieved this tub as a baby shower gift. When I saw it I said wow this tub has such great features this will be perfect. Until the day came that my daughters umbilical cord fell off and I very excitedly pulled out the tub and read the instructions. I set up the tub and the sling. The sling is wonderful but the tub leaked all over the kitchen table and the floor. What was supposed to be such a wonderful experience became a nussance. Though I continued to use the tub in a regular sized tub until I got to the store to but a new tub. I also found that water does not totally empty out of the tub even if you leave it set completely upside down. The water stays in the nooks where the bathring sits and gets a film. Granted the sling was a very helpful thing it wasn't worth the money and hassle......
1,Horrible Product,"This tub is adequate for an infant. The sling is nice, but overall, using this thing is a hassle. There is no easy way to store it. Good luck cleaning it. Oh, and it leaks like a sieve. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!"
1,Not so good product,"I got this tub as a gift and I thought it was great at first. After 11 months of using this tub, it started leaking at the bottom. We can no longer use it because as soon as we filled it up the water would come right out from the bottom. And, it was also hard to lock in place."
1,What a waste,"I thought I would have a tub that grew with my child. Well it leaked from the bottom and the sling never worked. My son kept slipping into the water as an infant, and I tried to change it over into the smaller tub but it didn't work. What a let down. Well, ended up I just used the kitchen sink, it worked just as well."
1,Water here water there water down the drain?,"Well I used this twice and it worked fine, but then all of a sudden the water started to disappear. I re-checked to make sure that everything was sealed tight. My husband used it and the same thing happened. So we started bathing him in the shower with us, but it won't work now since he is a wiggleworm. Also VERY hard to move an adjust. I almost broke my thumbs off trying to readjust this thing. Don't buy this tub, it will suck your money down the drain."
1,Abandon Ship!,"I used this tub for the first time for my one month old just yesterday. It is a leaky contraption! It was my husband who had picked out this tub thinking that it was the best for our baby, but it is most regretably the worst investment I have ever made in baby products! Save your money and get something like the euro tub or something with no holes in it. This tub DOES NOT hold water at all! I think I will go out and buy a different tub as soon as tomorrow, this tub is just not worth it at all!"
1,Save your money,"This tub was the worst! Talk about making your job harder than it already is! It leaks, the sling hardly stays in place, it takes up so much space, and you have to use it in the tub anyways. It is more trouble than it is worth."
4,This Tub is the BEST!!!,"I used a couple baby baths before coming across this one and none of them compared. This is the only bathtub that actually gives my baby room to play a little bit without being in the big bathtub since he is only 11 months old. This bathtub is great and I've never had the problems others are talking about. It is a little hard to extend/shorten but that just means its sturdy. And once I extended, I've never shortened it again, so to me that wasn't a huge problem. When I first began to use it, I used it on the kitchen table, I do recommend this bathtub for use inside a regular bathtub to minimize the water mess, but overall it is the BEST bathtub I've come across."
2,waste of your money,"I received this tub along with the eurobath tub for my shower a month before my daughter and son were born.I used it when bathing my son and noticed it was leaking after the first use. Definetly a waste of money. Though the directions may be easy, why not invest in something that works better for you and your baby. I have used the eurobath ever since and despite some of the reviews; have not had any problems."
2,Not Good for Newborns,"The tub first of all was very difficult to lock into place, even then it leaked. Second, it has a lot of hard plastic areas that can scratch your baby's skin. The sling is not even worth using, my son just slid down and sunk into the water. I went and bought a foam cushion and put that right in the tub and my son liked it much better."
1,Buy something else!!!,"I was excited about this tub thinking it would grow with our son. Well, we have not used it but a handful of times. It was hard to get together. Then it leaked and we had to do it all over again. I thought the little sling would be great to hold him up and it did just that, but then the poor guy was freezing because the water did not cover him at all. The sling has two metal rods down the sides to hold the fabric and these each rubbed the backs of his arms and left red marks, but until he could sit you could not use the tub without the sling. We started giving him baths in our normal bathtub with just a handtowel under him and it worked the best of all. A little strenuous on the back, but no leaky tubs to content with. I have met people who use the eurotub and lOVE it, it is the only one I have heard rave reviews of."
2,sharp edges,"I purchased this tub because the toddler ring will not suction to the bottom of our tub. This tub seemed to have great features, particularly the easy storage feature. However, the underside of the inner ring has sharp edges, leaving my 6 month old with red marks across her chest and arms. I have already returned it and was very disappointed."
1,This bath tub is no good!,"I just purchased this bath tub for my 3 1/2 month old son as he has alredy grown out of his first tub. I thought I'd be able to get a lot of use from it but was really disappointed when I went ot use it. First, the safety latch you push on with the palm of your hand was so hard to push that I had to have my Husband do it. Second, the thing leaked all over the place and was totally unusable- not sure if it's defective or what but after fiddling with it for a long time and getting water all over the counter and the floor I ended up just bathing my Son in the sink with nothing at all. I found this tub to be very difficult to use and would not recommend it!!"
2,Don't waste your money,"I used this tub for about a week and then gave up. Unless you have a PhD. in physics you can't get it to seal the right way causing leaks all over your counter. I was able to stop the leaks once, but then when I moved the tub to get it closer to the sink the suction cups were stuck down and it pulled the tub apart causing a major flood. I did have to give 2 stars because the baby sling/hammock that came with it is great. I used it with my son and now with my daughter 3 years later. Save your money and just buy a hammock and put it right in your bathtub, skip the middle man."
1,Do Not Buy this Tub,"Not only does it leak, but the ""hammock"" they provide has a serious flaw: it gets very cold very quickly. The material gets wet, but because it does not sit down in the water, it gets really cold. I laid my week-old baby on it and he cried all the way through his bath. After about 3 baths I realized what was happening and we tossed this tub out. In all good conscience, I can't even give it away."
3,Ummmm....NO,"This is the first tub we bought when registered back in oh my 2005. MISTAKE! I should have read reviews first! This tub leaks! You will read the occasional review saying this tub doesnt leak for some people and that the snaps have to be engaged and blah, blah. No, ours leaked all the time! We eventually took it back and got a wonderul tub with no seams and that has a removable hammock. DO NOT BUY THIS! BRU almost didnt take this one back. Don't waste your time."
3,Ok product for mellow baby,I really enjoyed using the tub for the first 4 months until my daughter became more active. She shakes her whole body and splashes around causing the sling to unlock and to slide back. There have been a couple of time where she ends up with only her head on the sling. Also the support system for sitting makes it extremely hard to wash some of her areas.
2,Not a Good Choice,"It is one of those things when the tub looks better in the box. For an infant the tub was way to big, my daughter kept sliding down. For a toddler the water wouldn't stay in the tub unless it was extended out to its full length...Which right there was one of the reasons I bought the tub is becase it was supposed to be compact. I would not recommend this tub to anyone, and I wish I would have bought a nicer one."
2,Leaks Like Crazy!!,"I originally loved this tub as I was using in our regular bathtub. But, when I moved it to the counter to avoid back-strain I realized that the tub leaked like crazy!! We had to put a folded up bath towel under the tub to catch all the water until we could get out and purchase a new one. I am so glad this was a gift and I did not spend my own money on it!! The only good thing was the little slide thing as it works great in the sink.... it's not worth $20 though."
1,HORRIBLE TUB!,"I received this tub at my baby shower along with the infant shower. The tub is a complete waste of money. No matter what I do, it leaks and I have to end up filling the tub up again in the middle of bathing my daughter. It's so frustrating. I just use the cloth seat that came with it and put it directly in the bath tub to bathe her now. What's the purpose of a 2 piece tub that you have to put together and leaks profusely??"
2,leaks,"We received this tub as a shower gift off our registry. At first we were dazzled with it's compactness. After assembling it correctly I noticed that the tub leaks. My husband an accomplished pediatrician thoroughly examined the tub, he had 2 comments, 1. The blue seal material is either not 100% waterproof , or it is not extended to the edges and up. 2.The mechanism of opening and sealing it, is too cumbersome. new parents need all the time they have, baby products need to be efficient and simple, this one is not. using it in the shower solves the leak issue!"
1,Adamsmom,"This tub leaks!I read a few of the reviews that mentioned the leaking, but bought it any way. We tried it the first time in the kitchen,and it flooded all over my countertop,cabinets,and floor.I tried it again in the bathtub,and all the water emptied before we even put the baby in tub.We ended up taking it back, and got a safety first folding tub.It works so much better,and only cost $10."
1,"Leaks, Leaks & More Leaks!!!","I, too, thought this was going to be a great tub! However, it was two weeks after I got it that it started leaking! At first, I thought it was the plug, but then discovered that it was the middle where you pull the two parts open to make it bigger. A friend of mine also got this tub as a shower gift and hers leaks too! I do NOT recommend this product!"
1,Junk!,"This item is junk. I originally chose it because it was a great concept, following the child through the stages. I received it as a shower gift from my registry and once home I wanted to try it out. When I expanded the tub, the center never snapped into place, so I could imagine that it would leak water out of it and perhaps could even pinch the baby's skin. I tried everything to get it to snap but had no luck. Then when I tried to collapse it I had such difficulty that by the time I was finished both of my hands were bright red from pushing and pulling and pressing the tabs. The tabs on the sides were impossible to push down. I thought this was a very poorly designed product and took it back immediately and purchased just a regular tub with an infant attachment. Don't waste your money on this product, it is junk!"
2,"It's okay, but....","We've only used this tub a handful of times because our son is only 3 weeks old. I have not had any problems with the tub leaking. But like I said, we've only used it a handful of times. I definately don't think this tub is appropriate for small babies. The tub has absolutely no support for his head OR his body. It takes my husband AND I to bathe him b/c the tub offers no help. It would be just as easy to put him in our full size bath tub. I wouldn't recommend this tub for small babies."
1,thumbs down,everyones right it leaks and is big to storebath sling is great and thats the only thingi like to complain to the companyif anyone knows the web site email me julie82762@aol.com
1,Not a good choice,"I would not recommend this tub. We thought it was a good idea to have a 4 in 1, but I don't like using it for my newborn because it's too cumbersome. We also followed the directions when putting it together, but it leaks. I can't use it anywhere else but in the regular tub and it's difficult with a newborn."
1,Leaks all over,This was terrible. It leaked all over the place. Finally my husband put silicone all around it which helped. Save your money & buy the cheap $10 one that's one piece.
1,Waste of money and what a mess!!!,"I got the tub as a gift and thought it would be a great tub due to it was a tub that could grow with your child. Well, it leaks all the time. In fact it is so bad I just wanted to pitch it and get something else. Now I am on child #2 and still have the darn thing. Now that my baby is 6 mos. old I know I won't need it much longer. I now use it unpluged and hang it over the sink ( I have a double sink in the bathroom) so the plug drains out in the sink while I use it so it won't leak all over the place. It is also hard to keep clean with all of the in the cracks of the plastic. So think twice before buying this useless product. A cheep basic tub and buying an easy bather(that bath sling thing) would be better and cheaper!!!"
2,I Hate this tub!,"I picked this tub because of the sling which worked out really well, but more than once this thing has caused floods in my house because it wasn't snapped in properly. It finally got to the point where I couln't use it any more bacause it no longer snaps together. And I never even used the shrinking and expanding feature so it's not like it wore out. If you can find another tub with a sling, get that. The sling is great for a newborn. My son has been in the regular tub since about 9 months. I use a short padded stool to save my knees. He can splash all he wants."
1,The ring cut my baby!,"I used this for an older baby (7 months), and it was a disaster. The ring is sharp on the bottom, and it actually scratched up my baby's arms in several places, as she tried to reach under it to grab a toy or play with her toes. What a stupid design for something intended for a little baby! It also leaked all over my kitchen counter. I returned it to the store."
1,Don't waste your money...,"I used this tub maybe five times before it started leaking. It is hard to put together, and the suction cups on the bottom make it extremely hard to move around (for example, if you want to move it away from the faucet after you fill it, you have to reach underneath and unstick the suction cups). I'm giving one star for the sling they include, which works well for newborns, but the tub itself doesn't seem big enough for older babies. I ended up buying the Eurobath instead, and love it."
1,AWFUL TUB,"It leaks, it is hard to clean and is a royal pain. I have my wife begging for a new tub. Avoid that by buying a different tub to start with"
3,Nice but heavy,I got this tub as a baby shower gift and I've been using it for 8 months now. This is a great tub to use however I also find this tub heavy and sometimes difficult to assemble.
1,This tub leaks,The collapsible part doesn't really eliminate much of the bulk of the tub for storage and it leaks. The tubs that don't collapse at all would be a better bet.
1,Terrible - What a waste of money,"Its too big for the sink and when I tried to move it off of the counter, it leaked all over the place. What a mess. It went right in the garbage after only one use!"
1,Buyer Beware!,"I purchased this tub because I liked the idea of using the same piece of equipment from birth until my son is sitting up well on his own. Buyer beware! I read all the directions, slid the tub open and locked it in place and it still did not hold water. I had to stuff a towel in the crack where the two pieces come together in order to get a few inches of water to stay in the tub. In addition, the fabric on the infant sling has too much ""stretch"". When I put the baby on it, the fabric slowly stretched lower and lower. Fortunately, the tub wouldn't hold water or the baby's head would have been under by the time the bath was over. This product should be taken off the market!"
1,Terrible--do not waste $$ or put on registry!!!,"This is the WORST bathtub EVER! It leaks where the seams are, and the sling is awful..does not support well. Also, where the seam of the tub is on the inside, there is a ridge that digs into baby's lower back, which doesn't seem too comfortable to me. The sling is too weak to hold baby up over this... even as a newborn (mine was only 6 lbs at birth!). You have to use at least one hand to hold baby up or to keep from slipping into the water (SAFETY HAZARD!!! HELLO!!!!!) So your hands aren't both free to clean baby. Just take my (and everyone else's it seems) advice and do not buy this or put it on your registry. I have, however, heard many good things about the eurobath. I think I'm going to buy that one to replace this piece o' bumpkiss."
1,Baby's first bath,"We got this tub as a baby shower gift, my fiancee was the one who set it up and everything. We used it once, only once. The second time we went to use it, the water would NOT stay in the tub. We tried everything, thinking it was an error on our part, NOPE! The plug was plugged in, but still, water would not stay in. We went out and got a different tub the next day, not recommended at all!"
5,My son loves it!,My 5-month baby cries when I take him out of the bath. Once it is put together the right way it is wonderful. It is deep enough for the baby not to get cold in the water and to be able to splash and play.
4,Son loves it.,Nice and large for lots of playing. Does not leak. Is a little difficult folding it up and unfolding it. We just leave it open all the time.
1,Dont waste your money,"I registered for the 4 in 1 bathstation.It is too big and bulky and poorly designed. It was difficult to snap the latches beneath the tub, which resulted in leaks.The fabric sling for newborns doesn't support properly and the baby slides down it easily and the babys head falls upon the hard rim. It doesn't fit in a sink and leaked twice. I would highly recommend the first years sure comfort deluxe tub. It has saved me time and space and I love it."
1,Where is the water going?,"I registered for this tub because it was not only affordable, but I could use it until I felt comfortable putting my daughter in the big tub. After less than 3 months, I am already shopping for a new one. The tub leaks! There are no holes and I am confident that the plug is secure. Where is the water going? This question plagues me every night while I leave the water running throughout my daughter's entire bath. This tub is a waste of water and money!"
3,Considering Returning It,I had ordered a different tub for my shower but never received it. I had my baby so I picked up this tub last week. However I could not figure out how to use the sling alone for my 1 week old infant. It appears that you have to hold her head up while in the sling which leaves you with only 1 hand to bathe her with. But anyone with an infant knows that they kick and squirm and I found it very hard to use. I tried to snap it into the tub for the 2nd stage (thinking better support) and I could not get it to fit!Much easier to sponge bathe a new baby on a contoured changing pad. I'm thinking of returning and going for the EuroTub.
2,Not a good buy!,"OK...I give up!!! After the fifth time using this tub and each time thinking that we had done something wrong on the assembly part of it, IT STILL LEAKS!!! First of all, I could not get the tabs to lock in...so my husband had to do it. When we thought that finally we had them locked in properly after a few uses the tub still leaks all over our bathroom counter! Also, my son slips down the sling and we have to constantly readjust him. I have decided to purchase something else that works better. Good concept but a waste of money!"
2,not a keeper,"We put this on our registry because it looked functional, but we were wrong. The concept of locking it on the bottom doesn't work. The buttons are very hard to push down on the top and the bottom. The newborn sling doesn't lock into place, we had to hold our baby up. we returned it"
3,waste of money,I got this tub at my baby shower and I was thrilled. It leaked all over my counter the first time i used it. I've tried everything to keep it from leaking but there is nothing you can do. I started using it in the tub but its really a hassle. The suction cups work a little too good. The sling part is slippery and he is constantly sliding down. Also the sides are very hard and make his arms all red. I recommend just using like a sponge type padding that you can just lay on the bottom of your bath tub until the baby is old enough to sit up.
2,"Sling is great, tub is not","I registered for this bath station and was thrilled when I received it... I love the sling -- and have had no trouble with my little one sliding on it. The biggest issue w/this tub is that it leaks -- and I've followed the directions to stop it from not leaking, but it still leaks! I'll need to buy another tub."
2,Leaky and doesnt fold easily,"this tub leaks - i had to put it in my bath tub to use it, which really hurt my back and made me nervous when taking my daughter out of the tub and trying to stand up. couldnt use it on a kitchen counter unless i wanted everything to get wet.doesnt open and close very easily - i gave myself more than one bruise (due to pinched skin) when trying to open and close it. also, by the time your child can sit up in this might as well put them in the big tub..my daughter slipped and slid all over when we tried to sit her up.too short - by the time she was 4 months, she was too long for this tub and would kick the sides.i had regisered for the eurotub, but rec'd this. preferred the euortub by far!"
1,Not a good buy,This tub was horrible for our newborn. Since it isn't water tight you have to place it in a bathtub. This makes bath time about 5X as long as a tradional tub that you can use on a counter or that fits in a kitchen sink.
2,It leaks!,"My SIL bought this tub for her son. I tried bathing him in it on the countertop and it started leaking from the place where it expands! The baby kept slipping off the insert and didn't look too comfortable.It seemed like a good idea, but it doesn't work.."
2,Wasn't what I hoped for...,"Although it has all the features I wanted, I find it has problems. If you don't get it perfectly snapped into place it leaks. Also, if you lean on or twist it when full of water it will leak. When you use the soft mess cradle in it the baby's bottom lands right on the seam or over the plug... This is uncomfortable for a newborn. Our baby is only 1 month old right now so I don't know if it will be good for an older baby or toddler."
1,Skip the expense,"I used this tub from the time he was 2months until he outgrew it at 6 months. I liked the sling idea, although mine didn't click in place and slid around some. I like the fact that you could wash the sling cover, but mine already has at least three holes so I won't be able to use it for another baby. I don't know where to get a replacement. I had to remove the suction cups on the bottom of the tub because they were a nuisance. I bought the tub because of the feature that it slide together for storage. I was hoping this would be a space saver, but it turned out that it is not easy to do, or practical to slide it everyday. My tub never did leak like some of the other reviewers. I found it difficult to clean the little grooves in the tub. He has been much happier just using our normal tub and it's a lot easier on me. If I did it again, I would use the sink or my normal tub with some kind of sling or bear cushion and simply skip buying the baby bath tub."
1,Waste of money,"Do not waste your money (or your friends' money) on this product. Very hard to set up. The tub slides closed for easier storage, however we leave it open since its so hard to set up. The tub is big and takes up alot of space. If the tub is not set up just right, it leaks. We bathe the baby on the kitchen table and have had several leaks where all the water ran out onto the table and floor. The tub has suction cups that are very hard to unstick. When trying to unstick the suction cups, the water has leaked out since the tub starts to come apart. Now we put the tub on a towel so the suction cups do not stick at all. We do not recommend this tub. Any other tub would be better!!"
1,Hard to put together,"I do not recommend this tub. It looks like a great idea, but the tub is 2 pieces and it is very difficult for one person to get it snapped together correctly. If it's not snapped together just right, it leaks."
3,Like it...,"I will admit that it leaked on us the first 2 times we used it... MADE A MESS! However, upon the 3rd time I checked it, I did see that it wasn't locked all the way, once I locked it... no leaks! Amazing! And I know that people have said that they know it's locked but I've even had friends that swore it was and when I check... nope, not all the way. We can't space save with it either, it sits in our tub most of the time, but I like it. The little sling, well I will admit that that doesn't stay in place most of the time, particularly when your little one can't sit but can roll and tries to all the time! But, we work with it, and she likes it... much better than the regular bath tub. I'd recommend it, but as a time saver and convenience... not everything toted on the box! I don't have to fill up the whole tub yet (time saving), it's always ready for her (convenience) and she does get support from the sling... Considering what infant baths are like, I'd recommend this one."
2,Difficult to lock and unlock,"Locking it into place was VERY difficult. Neither I nor my husband could do it at first. We were afraid that if we applied too much force it would break. I was finally able to lock it in place to expand it for use, but when I I tried to unlock it for compact storage (as recommended in the instructions)I broke a locking tab--just what I was afraid of. We still use it as it remains locked in the expanded position, but I noticed it leaking a bit the other day. The four-in-one idea is a good one; however, the craftmanship of this product is poor. Be sure to unplug all electrical appliances on your kitchen counter if you use it there. I wouldn't trust its ability to hold water."
1,Don't Buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"As a first time mom this product looked great. I set it up in my daughters room and poured a small amount of water in, checked for leeks, no problem so I proceeded to fill it up. Next thing I know her room turned into a lake!!! Dont waste your money!!!!"
1,Good idea gone BAD!!!,"When I saw this, I thought it was the coolest thing as it makes it look like you can use it on your counter so you don't have to be hunched over. WRONG! It leaks SO badly. It MUST be used in the tub thus defeating the purpose of buying it. It is also very bulky, so you can't get in the tub with your baby and it is a pain in the neck to store. Save your money and just buy a tub ring ( which is the ONLY good thing about this product)!"
1,Not worth the hassle,"This tub wasn't easily assembled/extended unassisted, there are areas prone to mold/mildew, the sling never securely snapped into place and slides out from underneath my son when bringing him to a sitting position and the underside of the bath ring is sharp and cuts his feet while kicking and splashing (as babies do). It does the job but I would definitely buy a different tub next time."
3,Good Tub-Need More Padding,"Our tub was fine while our son was small. But as he grew, and we had to use the front guard so he could sit up on his own, we realized the guard in front caused very bad skin irritation. The edge of the guard is very rough plastic. If there was some sort of padding or if the edge was even more rounded it would not be a problem. Just trying to help."
1,Very Disappointed!!,"I registered for this tub because I liked the idea of it growing with our baby, however I am very disappointed with it. I used the sling which was okay in the very beginning for sponge baths, but because my baby is long I ended up having to use the tub to bathe him and I couldn't lock it into place so it leaked all over my dining room table and without the assistance of my husband I am still unable to lock it into place and it doesn't fold down that easy either and be very careful if you are following the directions that come with the tub for attaching the sling to the tub because they DO NOT snap into place like they say and show which resulted in the sling sliding into the water when we placed our baby in it. Thank god we were holding him! when i called the 800 number they said the directions were incorrectly printed and to disregard them well I think they should recall it so it doesn't happen to anyone else that perhaps wouldn't be supporting their baby."
1,Very disappointed,The tub leaked everywhere with the first use. And when I used the sling in the tub it was uncomfortable for the baby. There is a raised area in the bottom of the tub that keeps poking in the baby's back. Would not recommend.
1,PLEASE DO NOT BUY OR REGISTER FOR THIS TUB!,"I registered for this tub, and received it as a gift. In the beginning, it was ok, but as he got older he started to slide down the sling everytime he kicks or moves, what a hassle to keep sliding him back up, so his ears don't get in the water. Now he is 5 1/2 months old and sitting up to take a bath, well this one is very inconvenient for babies sitting up, because it's hard to wash their bottoms. And, if you try to lay him on the sling, he just twists and turns to sit up. I never had problems with leaks, but the bottom suction cups broke off. Please don't buy this product."
1,LEAKY TUB,Everytime I would put my daughter in this tub it would leak. My husband had to bang the blue piece in place each bath time to get it to not leak. So I got fed up and bought a different tub. My cousin called me a few weeks after that (our babies are a month apart) saying that her baby tub was leaking.. come to find out she had the SAME TUB. So i highly suggest you not waste your $ on this product.
3,Not great for newborns,"I used this tub with my 1mth old, and she cried the whole time. The infant attachment piece did nothing but upset her because she was slipping and sliding (it was hard hold her and wash) and you have to fill the tub up quite a bit for the baby to stay warm. Looks like it is better made for baby's that sit up."
2,Owned for 2 years and 2 babies,"Honestly, after two years and two babies the only part of this bath set that remains (actually being used) is the sling. I place the sling on the floor of the family bath tub and fill to just below my baby's ears. The sling never seemed to fit the little tub and my baby would slide down. If I lifted him back up he would bang his head on back edge of the tub. By the time my little one can sit up its easier and more cost effective to place a small towel in the family tub and let him sit on that. Don't waste your money."
1,Leaky even with it snapped well,"This tub is really just not worth it. Even if some people have had good experiences, look at how many haven't. There are better tubs on the market -- affordable too.The sling is alright - we use it in the regular bathtub.The bathtub itself is awful - it leaks everywhere. It would be nice if it didn't leak but it does. I had seen the review on here where someone mentioned that maybe the tub wasn't snapped or locked in well -- this one was and it still leaked.Honestly - just look elsewhere - the headaches aren't worth it - looks like you have a 25% chance of getting the one tub that won't leak. Ours is in the trash."
2,It Leaks!,Even fully expanded with the center piece completely snapped this thing leaks. Don't waste your money on it. I did like the sling for when she was very small but the bathtub itself is awful. We stopped using it.
2,Leaky,"When we started using this, it was great. We had no problems. I used to keep it on top of my bathroom countertop until Chandler got to kicking too much water all over the bathroom! Luckily, because if we hadn't moved it back to the bathtub, my bathroom would be flooded, because one day it just started leaking and it WAS snapped together properly. We are going to get a new plain tub because this certainly did not last him any time at all."
1,Ugh! Don't waste your $ on this tub!,"We bought this tub for our son when he outgrew his infant one thinking it would grow with him. All the little indents never dried out well, it was difficult to make smaller for storage, so we just left it full size. It began leaking after about 5 mths of use! We made sure it was locked properly, but it kept leaking. It was a huge waste of money. We had to buy a different one."
2,in the end - disapointed,"I was initially pleased with this tub. The sling is great, however the tubs leaks quickly. I assume that when it is expanded it just never fully seals again. My son is now 9 months and he loves the tub, howver bath time is cut very short because the water leaks out. It is also very difficult to clean where the grooves are. I called the company and they said that if I sent the suction cups and the plug to them they would send me a replacement tub after they received them. How am I supposed to bathe my son in the interim? If the tub made some adjustments I think it would be great."
1,LEAKS LEAKS LEAKS LEAKS!!!!,"This tub sounds great on the box but not worth the effort. LEAKS LEAKS LEAKS!!! I received this tub as a shower gift and was truly excited. When my daughter was able to be submerged I filled it up, left the room to undress her and came back to an empty tub. To this day it will not hold water for more than 10 minutes. My bathtub fills with more water than this baby bath when I'm trying to fill it for my daughter's tub. Buy the cheaper non-collapsable tub and forget about this one."
1,leaking a flood...,"The 1 time I buy something (in hte store) without reading reviews and look what I get-a flood. forget about closing it to save a couple inches, you could break your thumb pushing the tab-otherwise it's great... oh, don't let the sling cool down-unless you like that look in a baby's eyes."
2,Leaked really badly for us...,"We received this tub as a gift, and our daughter seemed to like the comfy sling. However, the tub leaked very badly for us, even following the manufacturer's instructions. We exchanged it for a new one in case ours was defective, but the second one leaked too. The clerk at babies r us said that she's seen lots of these come back because of leaking. I would recommend a one-piece tub (which we ultimately purchased) instead."
2,Try another tub,I've used this tub since my baby was born 6 months ago. There are far more things I dislike about it than like.I liked the sling. I used it alone in the kitchen sink.I disliked the sling in the tub. I felt it did not fasten securely to the tub and there wasn't enough cushioning for his head and bottom. My son now sits up on his own but I feel he can slip too easily in this tub.
2,waste of money,"I received this as a gift. I tried several times to use the tub but, it is cumbersome. It has also leaked on me a few times. Its not that I don't know how to use it, its just that after having a C-section, I am not strong enough to push down where you need to to keep the water in. My husband could only do this.... I used the sling by itself in our regular tub. She is old enough to sit in the baby tub now, but I am going to purchase a regular seat for the tub. Why bother filling this one up with water. Its just another thing to clean. When I was in the store, someone suggessted to purchase the ""pillow thing"" and just use that in the tub. I should have listened to her advice."
1,EVERYONE : Important : PLEASE READ THIS,"I already had written my review about this. But now I want to share with you something important. Those who already have this tub - HAVE YOU EVER SEPARATED THE TWO PARTS OF THIS TUB for cleaning? Usually nobody does that. After 8 months of use and regular cleaning, one day we separated the two parts of the tub. To our surprise, there was a lot of wet dirt, mould, rust accumulated below the overlapping area which you cannot see and clean if you don't break down the tub into two separate parts. After seeing that ugly thing, I was almost going to throw up. I'm now wondering how much clean the water was in that dirty tub. And imagine your baby swollowing that water!!! I already threw that tub out. So if you already have this tub, PLEASE CHECK YOUR TUB for the underneath dirt. And those who want to buy it...good luck!! I won't recommend this tub to anyone."
3,leaks,"I will admit, I read the instructions and was still an idiot and didn't lock that middle thing down. Anyway, after I figured that out, it worked great....for about 2 months. Now it leaks enough that I put a towel underneath it while bathing my 13 week old. It's not bad enough that I feel I need to get a new one, but if we have another, I will probably get a different tub."
2,Not a good tub,"I received this tub over a year ago when my son, now 15 months, was born. I am expecting another baby soon and was researching different tubs when I stumbled across this one. I had to put my two cents in.Generally, this is not a good tub. The newborn sling slides over one of the sides and creates a hard surface for the head. He was constantly sliding down the sling - had to put a hand towel underneath him to keep him in place. Once he was able to sit, the underside of the detachable ring kept rubbing against his knees, making his knees irritated. The middle of the tub NEEDS to be pushed down and locked into place, which required a lot of strength."
1,scarred my baby,"I thought this tub would be useful because of the sling, which was great when my child wasn't moving. Once she started kicking her legs she cut and scarred her foot on the blue ring. I was very disappointed. I have since contacted the company which has offerred a refund, however, I was hoping they would do a recall instead."
4,Good for the Money,"I bought this tub with my first daughter 2 years ago and I had her in until she was 8 months old. It worked great. The tub never leaked and was comfortable for her. The only thing I did not like was the sling has a mesh cover on it and it get's dirty quickly because when you have a baby they go pee-pee in the tub. I had to wash the cover every time before I used it. I now have another little girl 3 months old and I am using it again and after a 1 1/2 of sitting in the closet it still works fine, no leaks or anything else, except that I still have to wash the sling frequently. The tub is great though they can use as a baby and then when they sit up. I do recommend this bath tub for the money and the short period of time they will be in it."
1,Not A Good Product,We received this bath tub as a gift and our's also leaked when put together correctly. We had to buy another bathtub for our child. From reading other reviews the leaking problem seems to happen often. I would not buy this product.
1,4-in-1 Tub Review,Could not get the tub to work properly - always leaked even though the sides were locked as specified. Ended up taking it back for something different. Would not recommend this tub.
3,complex tub,"i am annoyed by this tub, but i wouldn't give it a lower rating because, to be fair, i haven't had my baby yet and have not had a chance to try to put it to use.however, just trying to assemble this tub is annoying, and i've decided that it can't possibly be worth the trouble.personally, i couldn't get the ""sling"" to hold in place on the edge of the tub. i also really had to struggle to get the two halves of the tub to snap into place. i barely even tried to get this plastic seat ring to come up and try and put it in place, because i was already pretty sure i would return the tub and i didn't want to break it. the blue parts that hold the tub together when extended fully open had already looked like they had minor stretching/cracking of the plastic (you can see the color change in the blue after trying to manipulate these parts) just from me trying to assemble it.the tub looks uncomfortable, too."
2,Not the best tub out there!,"I received this tub as a shower gift. I had registered for it becase I thought it was a great idea. I ended up returning it before my daughter was even born. As I was taking it out of the box, I was very unimpressed with the quality. it's poorly constructed and very cheap! After I returned it, I bought the Sassy tub- less money and better quality! I highly reccomend the Sassy tub over this one."
1,don't buy it!,"The only good thing about this tub is that I was able to return it and get a eurobath instead. The 4-in-1 was leaky, shallow, hard to clean, the suction cups didn't stick and my daughter had a hard time sitting up in it. Also, the ring had very sharp edges- I tried it once (the ring), baby scraped herself, so everything went back in the box & back to the store. I really wish I'd gotten the eurobath first and skipped this one!"
2,leak proof....not!!!,"I personally chose this tub because it looked like a very nice one. It extends and has a removable ring which are two nice qualities. But I found that it actually is not a good tub at all. It stains near the middle to where you can not clean it very well, but worst of all, you still have to put it in your big bathtub because it leaks!!! Not just a little either. I do not recommend this tub for anyone at this price!"
1,This Tub NOT Recommended,"We received this item as a shower gift. It was great for the first month. After that, the water mysteriously drains out and within 5 minutes of putting our daughter in, the tub is empty before we're done with her bath. We are buying a new tub."
2,too difficult to clean,"We have not had any trouble at all with leaks or with getting the sling to snap into place, but I still would not recomend this tub. There are too many nooks and crannies that trap water and are very difficult to get into to clean, so mold and mildew are a big problem."
2,Not as safe as I thought!,"I bought this when my baby was a month old and at first it was great but now his 4 months and he slips off of the sling and I constantly have to hold him so he wont be sinking, this isnt a safe tub, I'm currently looking for another tub, so don't waste your money on this."
1,headache from the beginning!,i bought this tub for my daughter. I had problems with this tub from the beginning. The only good thing about this tub was the sling. It was perfect because her face and ears never got wet. The suction cups would never worked. the plug would never stay in place and water would leaked all over the place creating a mess to clean after bathing her. I only used the tub for two weeks before pitching in the trash. My husband finally bought the safety 1st tub...and it was wonderful.
2,Major Leaking Tub!,"I got this tub from a close friend and the first time I tried to use it, it leaked! I found that if you don't extend the tub it leaks to much. Not a good tub to buy!"
2,"Okay, but I think you might do better","I got this bathtub because I read good reviews about it; however, since using it, I haven't been all that enthusiastic. I do like the fact that you can use it several different ways, but my biggest complaint about it is that the underside of the support ring has sharp edges. When I first started using the ring, I didn't realize it was so sharp, and my daughter kept getting tiny scrapes on her legs. I figured out that it was the bath ring, and now I'm more careful, but I think the manufacturer should have made the tub with delicate baby skin in mind. Also, who wants to collapse the tub after every bath, which the directions suggest that you do? If you don't collapse it, even if you turn it upside to dry, the edges that slide together can begin to mildew. In hindsight, I would buy a tub that's all one-piece."
2,A POOR BABY SHOWER,I RECENTLY PURCHASED A BABY SHOWER AND IT ONLY WORKED TWICE AND THE BATTERIES INSIDE ARE BRAND NEW. SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IS WRONG WITH IT. I JUST FEEL LIKE I GOT RIPPED OFF AND I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS !!!,"This tub LEAKS!! By the time I got my baby ready to put in the tub (which was only about a few minutes), the water had leaked out. Stupid design - do not waste your money!!!!"
1,Not all that great for newborns,"I put my daughter in this tub to take her bath and she pushes so much with her feet that she pushes the tub to its full extension. That means as I'm bathing her, I have to keep pulling the tub back to the shorter size. For the money, there are better ones on the market."
1,It Leaks,I had registered for this tub when I had my son. It was great until about 4 months later when it started to leak. Needless to say it went to the garbage. I then began to use a blow up bathtub that fit in the tub. I am now expecting my second child and I will have to buy a new infant tub and it will for sure not be this one!
1,BRUISED MY DAUGHTER'S LEGS!!!!,"A good concept - but a horrible design. The blue ""ring"" that surrounds baby has no padding at all. My baby - like all babies - loves to move around & splash in the water. She would kick her legs & hit the hard, plastic blue bar. Gave her very deep bruises & a week of very sore legs. Should be recalled or taken off the market altogether!"
3,gets mildewy,I had this with my first born and loved it.Bought another one for my second born and hate it- threw it out this weekend.Because of the crevices at the bottom of the tub cant be properly dried out they kept turning pink.I could only clean it partially with a q-tip.The sling and tub size are great-the mold is not!
2,"Beautiful, but bad shipping","Posters were beautiful and just as advertised.BUT, instead of being shipped in a traditional hard poster tube, they were rolled inside of a flimsy triangular tube thing. They had been crushed, with a lovely crease every 3 inches or so when unrolled. I needed them for a speakeasy event I threw several days after they arrived, or I would have sent them back.Alas, they were beautiful....the shipping method was very questionable though."
2,Disappointing,"This book is mainly focused on BMW motorbikes sold in United States, nothing about the spectacular WW2 BMW sidecar R72, almost nothing about the great BMW's Dakar pedigree, almost nothing about smaller 650 bikes. Not enough information about the GS 1200 R (this is a particular important model since is BMW best selling bike). I was expecting a more global approach."
2,A lullaby,"The setting and characters could be the backbones of terrific plots, but wishing doesn't make it so. I keep nodding off. At the very start, a bridge player, with a perfect hand, starts choking and is dead within seconds. With a Thirteen heart bridge hand, his death is a shame. Maybe because the death (Is it murder?) is at the beginning, no one has bonded yet. Neither the residents of an assisted living facility, nor I, care much about the death.Speaking for the characters and myself, I hope it's murder; that will spice up the book and keep me awake. It's quick reading for a shuttle flight."
1,worst pump ever,the fuel pump lasted less than 2 months long and carter will not honor the year warranty you have to go through amazon and if it longer than 30 days you cant return it through amazon .i will say amazon's customer service will work with you alot more than the manufacturer will not very impressed with carter /federal mogul at all i say it the worst customer service ive dealt with
5,ONE OF HAL ROACH'S BEST COMEDIANS,"Harold Lloyd was definetly among the silent movie era's best comedians.My two favourite films in this compilation are Safety Last and Girl Shy.Until I bought this DVD set,I had only seen the image of Harold dangling from the clock near the top of the building.So I finally got to see the actual movie.It was nerve wracking.Our Gang member Joe Cobb appears at the beginning of Girl Shy.But my favourite part of this film is when Harold tries to stop a certain wedding from taking place.First he steals a streetcar,then a cop's motorcycle,than a wagon pulled by two horses.He really made those horses run.Hilarious.I have to agree about the two Harold Lloyd talkies,The Cat's Paw and The Milky Way.Pretty cheesy in comparison to his silent films.Especially The Cat's Paw.That film's final scene is rather disturbing."
5,Couldn't resist...,"""De-mystifying"" a musical genre is a favorite practice of many historians, educators, and musicians, and has been overdone. Unlike them, but not unlike a master performer, Palmer is able to strike a balance between technique, feeling, and authenticity: He is historically and musically adept without denying the Blues its inherent mystery and evocative nature.Palmer put his life into this work and it shows: he without a doubt ""convinces."" I highly recommend his Deep Blues."
5,Great book for growing in your prophetic gifting.,"As someone that has just recently received the gift of being a seer, I found the information very helpful. I would recommend this book not only to people that have this prophetic gift, but also for those seeking the higher gifts and those church leaders that have people with these gifts in their congregation, but need to understand the gifting better."
4,ALL THAT & MORE,"THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ!!!!! I THINK I HIGHLIGHTED THE WHOLE BOOK. IT IS CONFIRMATION FOR THOSE BEGINNING IN THE PROPHETIC, ENJOY!"
3,Loses it's steam,"Let me start by saying I love Laurie Colwin's writing most of the time, but this book disappoints towards the end and that kind of ruined it for me. Ms. Colwin repeats parts of her story again and again. It's almost as if she is trying to ""stretch out"" the book and cannot think of anything new to write. It gets extremely tedious and I lost my interest and just wanted to finish the book and get it over with. Not her best effort. She should have shortened the book and it would have been much better. In my opinion the author lost sight of where she was going with Polly's character.Pat Murphy"
2,Im not a kid,In my opinion most of these songs sound the same. And One Time To Many is a blatant rip-off of Cadillac by Mest. The meanings are good but the music is very mediocre and boring. Just my opinion.
3,A bit disappointed,"I was fascinated by the original book and this one just wasn't as good. As I think back, my main impression was that it was a comparison of Newton and Einstein. Perhaps I just didn't understand what he was trying to say?"
5,Great narrator voice for a great book,"Hawking's classic text really comes alive and is revitalized in this audio version. I listened to the audio book of Brian Greene's ""Fabric of the Cosmos"" a couple of months ago, and funny enough, I ended up getting Hawking's ""Briefer History"" on audio CD and its the same narrator, Erik Davies. As anyone knows who listens to audio books alot, you had better REALLY like the narrator's style and voice, otherwise no matter how good the original text is, its just going to annoy you. Davies' voice and style keep up the energy and tempo of the text that keeps the reader engaged, which is a challange when listening to audio books than are non-narrative. I certainly recommend this audio version - it won't bore. I see also that Davies' has narrated novels like Tami Hoag's ""Kill the messenger."" Those types of novels are not usually my thing, but I am thinking of getting it just because I like Erik Davies' voice!"
4,Brief History of Time,"I liked the book. It read well, but since I have read other books by Mr. Hawkings. This book contained a lot of the same material that was in some other work.But there were some new material that I enjoyed reading."
5,Easiest One Yet to Read and Understand,"Of all of Hawking's books, and I believe I own and have read them all, this one is by far the easiest to read and understand. Difficult topics to comprehend are taken step by step, mostly in laymen's terms, from the beginnings of astronomy thru current efforts to find a unified theory for everything. If you really want to begin to understand our place in the universe this is a good place to start, followed by earlier books written by Dr. Hawking. You can knock this book out on a Saturday morning a dazzle your friends with your newfound knowledge on Saturday night."
3,Too Brief,"""A Briefer History of Time"" is a graceful summary of spacetime physics, written entirely for non-scientific readers; it contains no formulas, and can be understood by any bright teenager. Before you run out and buy a copy, though, you should know that - due to the book's very short length and intended readership for a general audience - it is very elementary and covers its field in only the briefest of ways. If the reader has read any other popular treatment of this subject in the last few years, there will not be anything new in the ""Briefer History.""Given Hawking's stature in the field, most readers would hope to get some kind of unique perspective or approach from this book. Unfortunately, as it is, the book offers little more than an incomplete run-through of a few basic ideas."
5,This book really makes you think,"This book takes on a nearly impossible task: explaining some of the most challenging questions facing theoretical physics--not to mention philosophers and theologians--today in a manner that everyone can understand. I'll admit that as a ""non-science"" type, some of this book went over my head. But it wasn't due to a lack of effort by the authors to keep things clear. In fact, the concepts that I found most difficult to follow were the most recent, least developed theoriesWhat I found most interesting about this book is that it leaves you thinking about how small a part of this universe we are and how improbable our existence is. This book inspires many more questions about our universe than it tries to answer. This is a great book to read and discuss with others as a result."
3,"Apparently a classic, but not illustrated in my edition","I found reviews that highly recommended this book, and it seems as if it will be a good reference book for my shelf, but I would not deem it the only Houston area garden book to own. The edition I bought has very few pictures, and information would have to be supplemented with online searches to find the pictorial identification that I like. I'm happy to own it, but it is not full-featured enough to be my ""be all and end all"" garden book purchase!"
4,Highly recommended !,This is THE reference for celestial cartography. Almost complete. Take it if you can get one. It's quite scarce.
5,Great book,Awesome book couldn't put it down. I love Clive Cussler books I can get enough of them. Off to the next one
4,"Finally, a Cussler book that feels like the old stuff","I always buy any new Clive Cussler book the day that it arrives in stores. The last few years, I've been dissapointed with each new addition to the series. Don't get me wrong, Clive Cussler is still my favorite author, but his writing just seems very stale and fomulaic lately.This book was still very formulaic along the lines of almost all past books, but it had a lot more character to it that made it seem like I was reading an old friend again.Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino are getting older in the series, but I'm one fan that is hoping they continue to have more adventures in the years to come. The idea of bringing in the kids of Dirk Pitt (Dirk Jr and Summer) seems to be not really coming together well. They are given bit roles and not fully introduced if they are going to be the main characters in future books.All in all, the Treasure of Khan was a fun read, and it was nice to feel like Clive was back writing with more character."
3,First Dirk Pitt,Overall I liked the book. My only complaint is that there erred many stories to converge together and found myself forgetting a connecting story or asking where does that story tie in. And I was first confused of Pitt 's kids and himself when the chapters started. But I will attribute that to being my first DO adventure.
3,Not Clive`s best,I found this book to be boring. Very little excitement till the end and even that was lacking. I like most of the Dirk Pitt stuff so I was expecting better.
4,"welcome back, gents!","a big hello and welcome back to dirk and al!great story as usual from clive cussler and dirk cussler!keep it up, guys!"
5,"If you buy only one mushroom field guide, this is the one!","Excellent! This is the best mushroom field guide I have ever seen. This book shows sharp photos of each mushroom, as well as photos in cross section and of the underside. Photos are not of the mushroom in its natural habitat, but are on a white background, so each photo is well focused and well lit. Also includes a tiny photo or drawing of the mushroom in its natural habitat. Comprehensive-includes mushrooms that don't appear in my other two books. Mushrooms listed both by scientific and by popular names. Extremely conservative in the 'shrooms that it classifies as edible. Book is designed for the beginner (""What is a Mushroom?"") as well as the advanced (spore chart). The quality of the book itself is very high; it is printed on excellent paper and stays open to a page when needed. It appears to be well bound and I think the paperback cover will look good even after many trips in the backpack."
3,Too Tidy,"I felt that this album was too clean for a live one, the way that the songs were edited.The band was spot on with their playing, but the album was lacking something, maybe the breathless interludes and speaking to the audience.Too reminiscent of a studio recording."
3,Losers Inc.,"This book is about a boy named Ethen and his best friend Julius, they are the losers of the class. They don't care about their grades they just care about passing(they don't try hard to get extra credit)One day when they went to school they noticed that there was a new student teacher, she was really pretty, and they wanted her to like them so they go way out of their reach to impress her. Mean while a girl named Lizzy(the lizard)starts to like Ethan because he supported her idea about the science fair project she thought of. While Ethan and his friends are at lunch they think up a plan to get lizzy to stop writting poems about nothing and Ethan. Ethan and Julius are still trying to impress the student teacher by making a science fair project. So they make her impressed but she doesn't love them. In my oppinion it was dumb."
1,Not helpful at all,"This books was no help at all for the Army AFAST test. Questions are answered incorrectly in the answer key (Key lists C as the correct answer to Problem X, then gives the explanation as to why B was the correct answer), the Complex Movements practice questions are completely different than those on the test, and some of the pictures in the Cyclic Orientation practice questions appear to be sequenced in the incorrect order.If you want a good book for these tests, stick with the ARCO book."
3,A mixed genre between the supernatural and Japanese History.,"Be warned, this anime contains a lot of history. Just watching it made my head spin from time to time. If you don't understand what is going on in Ghost Slayers Ayashi, this anime can get pretty boring, fast. Sure there are some action scenes and encounters with creatures that the Ayashi fight called Yoi, but it also takes place during the time of the Shogun era. Regardless, the power that the Ayashi use are called Ayagami and that power allows them to draw the names of characters in order to wield as weapons. With that said, I can't say that this anime was bad or good. I liked it, and I hope you enjoy Japanese History anime as well. To me, this was like a mix of 'Princess Mononoke' and the popular video game 'Okami' :)."
4,Should have gotten the hard-cover,"I got the ebook and there are some maps, pictures etc.... in here that I would have really liked to see that did not turn out well in the ebook version. The book is fascinating but taking a star away from the ebook version picture quality."
5,Powerful explanation for paradoxes in American culture,"This is a very detailed but highly readable work on the four separate immigrations of very different English-speaking peoples to the American colonies which shaped the political, cultural, social and religious values of the country. The first section treats the New England Puritans, the second the Virginia ""cavaliers"", the third the Quakers of the Pennsylvania/Delaware regions, and the fourth the Scots/Irish. Each came from distinctive areas of the British Isles, and each had significantly different life styles, beliefs, and attitudes which shaped the future country. As a fascinated lifelong student of American history, I have been intrigued by the new information and Professor Fischer's fascinating construct which offers a cogent analysis of the often conflicting values in American society."
5,Absolutely fascinating,"Fischer showed me a view of American settlement and the origin of our customs and folkways which I had never seen. I hold a B.A. in history and am 60 years old. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning more of our origins, especially the origins of our different conceptions of Liberty."
4,Ambitious!,I give this book high marks just for its very ambition! A must read for those interested in early US history. This is the longest book I have ever read without a narrative!
1,Don't Do It!,Please do not buy this software. This rush to release VERY bad software should not be encouraged. It is virtually unusable as it now is. I am an ACT user since the DOS days and have always upgraded when avaialable. I'm cured now. I have a new Dell Pentium IV 3.3 GHz Computer with 1 GB of RAM. Even with all that this program is a DOG! Any stars associated with this product is laughable.
1,If I could give it less than one star - I would,"Here is why:SLOW - For the one or two positive reviews on this software that blame the slow speed on the user not having sufficient hardware - I DO have 512 MB of RAM. And the amount of time wasted to do just about anything with this software is to say the least frustrating.\Took COUNTLESS hours just to get a home custom label created that worked. And the tutorials, etc to help were full of the wrong advice. I wonder if they bothered testing this software at all before putting it on the market.I could go on and on...but given that I have wasted enough time on this software, just read the other reviews.And to top it all off Best does not provide support for the upgrade - without purchasing it. So here is the scenario:1) The product is riddled with problems.2) To get assistance for the upgrade you must ""purchase"" it.I am looking for alternatives and will never buy ACT again - unless they clean up their ACT."
1,This product is crap!,"If you are thinking about buying this software, don't! Save your money and get a rolodex, it would be easier to use and operate much faster. I purchased this product less than 90 days ago for about $200. As of today, it won't even start up. When I went to the ACT website I was dissapointed to find out that you can't get technical support unless you pay them IN ADVANCE for the help. From the day I installed this program my computer became sluggish, requiring many restatrs throughout the day. Send a message to the makers of ACT...don't buy this product!"
1,"Wow, such hypocrisy.","I was trying to relate the experiences of the people who rated ACT a 5 star with my own, and came across a great revelation.David Delude wrote ""One reviewer says that positive reviews are written by shills. I disagree . . ."" however, HE IS A CERTIFIED ACT CONSULTANT. In my eyes, he blatantly lied. Of course he is biased, its his job to support ACT. A couple other of the reviewers are also. So who do you trust, the users of ACT or those people who are make money off people buying ACT.PS. Check out http://www.actca.org/list/USA/#CA -- hello Mr. Delude"
1,Won't import phone numbers from Outlook,"I'm usually not one to bash, but when the software won't import phone numbers from Outlook, it just doesn't cut the mustard. I'm an experienced PC user and file manipulator and Act! would not recognize phone numbers in the direct Outlook to Act! import wizard, nor would it import them from dbase and text delimted files.A call to tech support put me on hold for over 30 minutes and I endured 3 handoffs, where they hard sold me their tech support package for a ""discounted"" $200 per year. When I was finally connected to the tech was not helpful nor was he knowledgable about my issues.Best software won't pay shipping on my return, and they want the software in the original packaging with all the manuals. This is a joke!"
1,"Slow, Unstable and did I say SLOWWWWWWWWW","This has to be one of the worst product ""upgrades"" in history. It is painfully slow and buggy.Writing an email message that used to takes mere seconds with Act!2000 takes at least 20 X longer as Act!2005 Email attempts to do a ""mail merge"" for a single contact text message.The sync conduit that comes with Act!2005 is one-way only, however, if you use Companionlink 2.0 as your sync conduit you can still have a 2-way sync in spite of Act!2005.The best comparison that I can make to this product is that of Windows v3.0, bloated, unstable and not ready for prime time."
1,Avoid this version,"Don't buy this version. It is a significant downgrade. Worst planning and development I have ever seen. Believe me, the new features are not worth the pour performance."
1,Zero Stars,"In the older version, ACT started up quickly, enabling you to look up a contact in a second. This new version starts up very slow. It also crashes frequently. The only feature I liked was the one-click to excel csv format, which I used only once. Avoid this version completely if you don't need this feature.Also, it does not support sync to Smartphone contacts on my cellphone. That would have been a big plus.The only saving grace is that it lets you use the older version of ACT.PC Magazine gave this unfortunate version 4/5 Stars! Should have read Amazon reviews before buying."
2,ACT 2005 Not Ready for Primetime,"My comment is relative to system specs. My experiment with ACT produced an application that was slow to load, slow to run and generally unsatisfactory.Other reviewers such as David Delude, have laid this problem at the door of system specs and/or software issues (resources, spyware, etc). Here are the most relevant system/software specs on my workstation, you can decide for yourself.Pentium 4 2.8 Hyperthreading1 Gig Dual DDR Ram2 Western Digital Raptor SATA Hard Drives in Raid 0Clean install of XP Pro fully patched to SP2I probably have a total of 6 processes loading at startup. (Anti Virus, Spyware Detector, Kerio Firewall, etc)I have returned to ACT 6. This software is too expensive for this type of performance.Just my two cents."
4,A Must for he study of moral theology,I recently complestes a diocese ministry program at Seton Hill University. This ws our main text for our Contemporary Christian ethics Course. When philosophy and ethics can be intimidating this text actually made the subjects we talked about in class a whole lot clearer.
4,It starts to make sense why....,This book is an outstanding contribution. The sections on smoking guns and the Zapruder film doctoring are amazing. It seems difficult to believe that Oswald would even be convicted given the new ground touched on in this volume. The cover up was massive in scope and scale yet I find it interesting that there has not been anyone admitting complicity. I highly recommend this book and believe it is a shame that such a whitewash occurred to the American people and the world at large.
4,More Please,"Of the hundreds of unused tracks XTC has in their cupboard, they thankfully decided to release a few on Coat of Many Cupboards. The best tracks are 'Us Being Us' & 'Things Fall To Bits' (probably the best things Barry Andrews wrote for XTC), 'Terrorism', 'The Troubles', and the demo version of 'Dear God'. Unfortunately, the needless inclusion of a few album tracks break the continuity.The CD version has a bonus track before track 1 on discs 2 & 3. Disc 2 is studio banter while recording Roads Girdle The Globe. Disc 3 is an edited (for swearing) version of Drunken Jam/Shaving Brush Boogie.[DW]"
5,"GREAT book, really enjoyed it.","This was a very clear and complete introduction to geotechnical earthquake engineering. It cleared up a lot of those ""grey"" areas and summarized current (say through '94) research."
5,"A Compelling, Lyrical Look on Sex and Relationships","Ben Schrank's second novel is a compelling, vivid exploration not only of sex, but more importantly of family and friendship. He elegantly weaves in the medieval Jewish myth of the Golem as a metaphor describing the protagonist's relationship with his father, friends, and especially with the object of his affection, the young lawyer with whom he shares some intense sexual encounters. Without divulging much of the plot, I shall say that this is one of the most intriguing examinations of relationships I've read, blessed with lyrical, poetic descriptions of sex that almost rival any I've read in the novels of John Hawkes. I greatly enjoyed reading Ben Schrank's literary debut, MIRACLE MAN; CONSENT is a worthy successor from one of our best young American writers."
4,Interesting examples of mathematical art.,"The author used a Fortran program to draw a set of lattice patterns that fall into seventeen categories. Each category corresponds to one of the seventeen two-dimensional space groups. The full-page design is created by first constructing a tile. An elementary set of line segments and arcs is taken and then manipulated using a space group. After a tile is created, it is repeated to fill the page.There are forty-four different designs on these pages and some are quite striking. As someone who has read books on mathematical art across cultures, I recognized some of the patterns. Not exactly, but to a high degree of accuracy. These designs are well worth looking at if you are interested in finding patterns for artwork, quilts or any other visual effect."
2,missing booklet,although it was new and wrapped; two discs were out of place and the booklet is missing. I would recommend the dvd set but not if it comes incomplete.
2,Poor quality,When you open the drawers it feels cheaply made! I felt like I would break it everytime I opened the drawer.
5,excellent personal attention by seller,"Because of this order being shipped from Russia, we had some shipping issues, which the seller handled with immediate and caring personal attention. This was greatly appreciated.!! The items are beautiful handmade and hand painted nesting dolls, exactly what I had in mind, and which will be family keepsakes for a long time to come."
1,not as expected,"I thought this would be a hard bone that he would simply chew off the meaty bits and then gnaw on over time. Instead, he chewed it to pieces in no more than 20 minutes. Then he spent the next couple days throwing up chunks of bone. My boxer is not an aggressive chewer but this bone is soft and can easily be broken down...no ""hours of enjoyment for your pet."" I normally watch closer when he's chewing something that he can break up but I thought I had nothing to fear with the bone.I wish the packaging had been clearer about the nature of the bone. However, I am am glad it is made in the US.In the meantime I'll stick to good ol' soup bones and antlers for him to gnaw on and I'll pay closer attention as he chews on something new."
1,Disheartening,"This book is an insight into the thoughts and experiences of a woman who participated in the ceremonies in an LDS Temple. Having been there myself, there are a few points in this book which are misleading to the uninformed. However, I don't blame Deborah for feeling the way she does if indeed EVERYTHING in this book is indeed factual. After all, perception IS reality.Additionally, I don't mind if someone doesn't appreciate what one religion or culture does or does not do. But to take what's sacred to a culture, step on it publicly, and then smear on the wall for all to see is simply disgraceful, and in bad taste - regardless of the intent.I found this book to simply be a slam against a bad experience the author had, and advise anyone considering reading it to regard it as such. It is NOT a good source for anyone wishing to learn more about Mormons or the LDS faith.Thank you."
5,Sad and fascinating,"This book is an interesting and extremely candid account of the life of a young Mormon woman who learned the same thing that I did, that following religious guidelines does not guarantee you a blissful life, that instead we must find our own peace and our own ways of relating to God. The attacks on this book are of course predictable because this book challenges the blind dictates of the Mormon church. Contrary to the acrimonious reviews, I did not find her to be attacking God, but rather the way His word is interpreted by some extremely narrow minded men."
4,More than Mormon secrets: a woman's trials to become herself,"Secret Ceremonies delivers the fascinating details of theMormon faith that are promised in the book's publicity, butthis book is much more than just a study of religiousrituals. It offers up, in intimate detail, the pain,pleasures and lessons of Deborah Laake's life and marriages.This book will fascinate any woman who has struggled withthe societal expectation that we will all marry and livehappily ever after."
2,This is a silly book by an even sillier woman.,"I read this book at 16 and had to laugh at the author and her expectations of the world. Even more amusing was her need to blame her problems on her religion. I joined the LDS church 6 months later, interestingly enough, and have come to see, as time passes, how incorrect she really was. But I give it two stars for being the amusing work of fiction it is."
2,Not to be rude but..,"I don't doubt this book, for many stranger things have happened in this world...lol..hence the springer show... Though I feel the referal to mormonism as a bit of a shocker. There are a couple bad eggs, but thats true for every group of people,and in reading these pages I have to say she got pushed through a whirlwind cuz her family was mentally confused to some degree, maybe even just misunderstanding the religion. I mean no disrespect but to delegate some of this to mormonism just shows how she doesn't even understand the religion at all and what makes it up. Thankyou."
1,Don't buy. The handle rips!,"Don't buy this bag. The handle ripped after 3 days of use. Go to walmart, but a coleman one for less than $7"
1,Waste of Plastic,"Don't bother, not only did the handle rip off on the first use, but the nozzle ripped off as well leaving us without a shower on our camping trip."
3,Not the same as dream signals,"Well if your looking for another CD like Dream Signals this is not it. But the album isnt realy bad or anything it simply goes down a different path than the Dream signals album (Which it should because it is the remixes if the that album).Mixed signals goes down an interesting path thats kind of a cross between ambient and something else. With very interesting sounds and the occasional melodies to go along with thim. The songs are very down tempo and are quite interesting if you have the patients. But for me I dont think this CD is something you cant put on and listen to unless its in the background or if your in the specific mood. I was dissapointed when I got the album, I just thought that the remixes would be a lot cooler and more listenable. I do not get the same listening enjoyment from this album as i do other Tristeza releases."
2,Nasty,"This book is definitely what you are looking for if you want to buy sex for around $20. But if you are looking for a real, clean (non-trailor park) woman...then honestly, don't read this book!"
1,Not the version I ordered!,"I did not receive the version of the CD that I ordered! I read another review in which the person didn't receive the correct version, but I thought perhaps that had ordered the wrong one- guess not since I got the wrong one too."
5,It blew me out of my seat!,"This is one of those songs that you want to hear over and over. I heard it for the first time in the car and I had to find out who it was. Finally, I heard the DJ say and then went straight for the music store. That is how moved I was. This is definitely 5 STARS!"
4,Hound Dog does dig,"This gadget actually does a good job at digging our weeds that are in grass such as dandelions. It worked very well for weeds with a shallower root. For deep roots, it still works but not as well."
3,It's not all that...,"This contraption is better than stooping and pulling by hand, and it is fun and easy to use. I just am finding it difficult to pull anything but medium to small dandelions in normal soil conditions. It doesn't work well in wet or damp dirt. I would say it pulls the dandelions out (root and all) 3 out of 5 times. I was fairly disappointed because I bought this due to the good reviews."
3,Average mechanical weed removal device,"As a device to remove weeds without the use of chemicals I would say that this is an average device. I'm not sure that it can remove deep roots (unlikely, unless you do it after a long rainfall), and you will get some contact stress when releasing the weed/dirt caught after stepping, i.e., you need to tap the knob with some force with the palm of your hand - - would probably get a sore hand in a short time."
2,Hard to use and ineffective,"Had the same experience as several others. I can only get it to pull up a small part of the root. I have a Fiskars weed eater that works much, much better, but unfortunately the model has been discontinued."
3,Hound Dog has fleas,"After reading the other reviews, I had high hopes for the Hound Dog. The tool is mediocre at best in my opinion. It's probably great in certain conditions and with certain weeds. My weeds are varied and my ground conditions range from pea gravel to dirt to grass to soil. The other aspect that doesn't work so well for me is the time. I guess I should have seen this coming but it's just much more efficient to be on your knees with an old fashioned dandelion puller (not even sure what they're called but the long metal tool with the prong on the end) than a tool that has to be centered over the weed, then steps 2 and 3....When I weed, I want to get it done quickly even if it causes me a little extra pain. That said the Hound Dog is inexpensive enough that I don't feel I got screwed, I think my expectations were too high."
2,"Fun, but annoying","For starters, this game looks great. It plays great.That's about it.The season modes, when playing with an underdog, are almost impossible to win. Not only will you not win, but the CPU will beat the holy crap out of you if you dont withstand it's cheating. If you want a great 2-player b-ball game, this is the one..Otherwise you might break something (like you ps2 controller) playing this game."
5,RETURN OF THE BEST,Story 1969-1979THIS IS Still The best disco house music single to date. i would appreciate it if you could manufacture several thousand copies because i feel that there are other DJ'S OUT THERE THAT FEEL LIKE ME. I MEAN OLD SCHOOL DJ'S. I HAD 2 COPIES OF THE RECORD BUT IT WAS STOLEN SO PLEASE LOOK OUT FOR THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS WHO SPIN THEN STEEL OR SHOULD I SAY THE CD'S NOW. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. CHARLES LEE
1,Junky,The assembly instructions are incomplete and confusing. The swivel adapter leaks more water than reaches the garden!
3,Polite & reserved,"The music is polite and soothing and good background music. Nothing that I could sink my teeth into.I had to smile at Mr. Bryson's comments below when said that he wants to get to know Bruch's music as well as he knows Brahms and said that he knows of no other composer besides Bruch that has written for the combination of clarinet & viola or violin. Actually, the use of clarinet in chamber music is not that rare. Mozart's trio for Trio for clarinet, viola & piano in E flat major (""Kegelstatt""), K. 498 is one such work and another is Robert Schumann's Märchenerzählungen for clarinet, viola & piano, Op. 132. And, of course, both Beethoven and Brahms wrote clarinet/cello/piano trios with the cello having about the same role as the viola."
3,Helpful,"I received this as part of a gift and was grateful. It may be true that medications come with their own droppers but it is always handy to have an extra one on hand, or just ot be able to keep this set in your baby's bag for travelling. It's compact and convenient. My thermometer works fine and I have used the nail clippers on several occasions; in my opinion this is a helpful and useful item to have."
3,Good To Have,This is a nice product to have. I have one in my diaper bag and medicine cabinet. The nasal aspirator that comes with this is not the best. I recommend buying the larger one.
3,"Buy The ""Generic"" Brand","Before you put this item on your necessity list, read all the reviews (including mine) and then decide if this product is really worth it. If it is, then buy the generic brand - ""Especially For Baby"". The price is cheaper and the colors are nicer. The only items I use from this kit are the nail clippers (although you can peel your baby's nails right off) and the nasal aspirator (most hospitals provide you with a larger sized one before you leave the hospital, and that one works much better) - everything else isn't really necessary until your baby is a little older. I was a little disappointed when I received this item. In my opinion, it wasn't worth the price and the quality was not that great."
2,Not Very Useful,"Overall I have not found this kit very useful. The bulb tip is too large to fit in my son's nostrils, and the bulb part too small to create any suction, so it does not work at all for my one month old. I have taken all of the items out of the case and use the case to hold other things (like a different aspirator) so I can find them quickly in the diaper bag."
2,Save your money...Not worth it!,"I received this as a baby shower gift and I honestly only used the nose bulb and the thermometer. The nail clippers were not sharp, I had to buy another from saftey's 1st (which are great!) The medicine droppers are still in the case. So don't waste your money, your better off with out this."
1,Waste of money,The bulb suringe is horrible as is the theromometer. The medicine dropper and spoon you get with medicine you buy anyway.
3,Don't bother - buy items you'll really use seperately,"The hospital will give you at least one bulb syringe. You'll probably have chosen a thermometer you really love and that works better than this one, any way. Nail clippers are inexpensive on their own & are include in grooming kits. Most things you'll need a dropper for come with them included & medicine spoons are about $1 behind the pharmacy counter. You just don't need this, unless you're dying for a zippered case that will be a pain in the neck to open when you actually need something in there. (Especially if you, like me, also got the grooming set from the same company & the cases are identical so you can't ever seem to keep them straight!)"
3,ok product,"My baby had reflux from the day she was born and seemed we were always having to give her medicine. We used the dropper the most-in fact the markings are starting to rub off. I liked the markings on the dropper. The ones we got free from the pharmacie were marked for smaller dosages. I like the nail clipper. i was afraid to use the aspirator -it looked too sharp to me. The medicine spoon is not usefull and the thermometer doesn't beep. The little case is nice, but overall, I agree buy the items separately."
4,Perfect for the diaper bag,"I received this as a gift at my shower and it's been great! The spoon and dropper don't get used alot but the clippers are easy to hold unlike many baby nail clippers and do the job beautifully, I don't use any other pair. The thermometer is best used rectally (and yes it can be used that way). It doesn't beep and you have to look closely to see that the flashing has stopped in the upper right hand corner of the display. The nasal aspirator baby has to ""grow into"" because end is a little on the large side but it works when you need it. This little kit is great for tossing in the diaper bag. I actually brought it to the hospital with me and I'm glad I did because I had to clip my daughter's nails the day after she was born. It's good for travel too because it's compact and it has practically everything you might need incase your baby or toddler gets sick away from home."
3,Ok for a toddler,"I didn't use any of the items in this kit until my child was at least 1.Cons: The aspirator doesn't work very well and is hard. The one I received in the hospital works much better. The thermometer takes way to long to register a temp. I could never get my son to hold still that long.Pros: I love the medicine spoon. He like to take the medicine off of the spoon and it is easily measured and less likely to spill than a regular spoon. The dropper is good if he doesn't like the medicine, but he usually tries to suck it out anyway. The nail clippers are okay, about the same as any basic pair."
2,Unneccessary,The only item I use is the nail clipper (great!). I like the nasal aspirator that the hospital gave me and the pharmacy gave me a syringe for my liquid medicine. The hospital gave me a thermometer at discharge. So-- I only needed one item out of the entire kit which would have been cheaper.
3,dont ask why...im just a first timemom,Okay i fell into the trapmostfirst time parentsdo...i had to have this!!! little did iknow that the hospitalprovided me with the majority of the things and now this set sits it a drawersomewherecollecting dust.imust have3of evertything in this kit!!! this is one of thoseitemsthat u should just buy thethings on aasneeded..the medicine spooncant youget thosefreefrom the pharmacywhen your child reaches that age??
1,not needed,"This I thought would have been useful, but hasn'tThe bulb did not work at all for me, I had another larger one that accually suctioned, unlike this one. The nail clipper was very dull and I accually ended up tearing the nails more than clipping them with this. The dropper is not necessary as all infant meds come with them already. My son is too young for the medicine spoon so I haven't used that. I got a thermometer from the hospital as well as a bulb suction anyway."
1,"Cheap, Cheap. Cheap!!!!",The zipper on the case busted the second time I opened it. The items inside are not very good quality. Spend a little more and buy the better quality items you need individually and put them in a small cosmetic case if you want them all together or for traveling.
4,Good to have,"I received two of these at my baby shower. I keep one in my daughter's room, and one in her diaper bag.The nasal aspirator is useless though. It doesn't work. The one you get from the hospital is the best. It actually sucks.The nail clippers with the handle is great! It's tiny for the babies, but you're actually able to hold it. The thermometer is nice. I've not used the medicine dropper yet.I think it's worth the price to have. I usually give them as gifts when someone is having a baby."
2,Disappointed,The soap fell off the blades after a couple of uses. I am thinking of switching systems because of what seems like poor quality.
2,Look closely at the picture!,"BUYER BEWARE! Look closely at the display picture and you will notice that these are the old cartridges that only have 3 blades. If you are looking for 4 blades, don't buy these! They aren't that bad and I will use the rest, but I will not buy them again."
5,"An emotional, beautiful book",Magnolia Sky is a beautiful book that will touch your heart in so many ways.Luke Boudreau has been avoiding the family of his fellow soldier Calvin Abbott for months. Calvin died on a mission that Luke was in charge. Luke was prepared to talk to Calvin's mother but had no idea there was a wife.Analise Abbott was making a wonderful life for herself with her deceased husband's family. Her marriage was far from perfect but she gained a family in his mother and brother. When Luke comes to town he upsets the balance in her life. Circumstances cause Luke to stay in town longer then planned. Ana and Luke are drawn to each other but they both have issues from their past.This book is a must read. The secondary characters will touch your heart along with Ana and Luke. Magnolia Sky was a very emotional read for me. I just adored this whole book. Looking forward to the next book.
4,"Great value for soldering power cords, low voltage wires, etc.","As others have said, this is too hot for fine electronics work, but it is great for soldering power cords and wires for low-voltage lighting and speaker systems, and it's hard to beat the price. Good value."
3,Holy crap this get's hot,This works good for soldering larger pieces but too hot for small wires.The heating element is really long which makes using it cumbersome.
1,Failed mid-way through project,"The iron survived desoldering capacitors from a motherboard. I unplugged it and ran to get replacement capacitors from an electronic shop. When I came back to plug it in, it wouldn't heat up at all. Yes it's a cheap iron, but it should give me at least a full use out of it."
4,Decent Soldering Iron,"Soldering Iron that does exactly what it states. Heats solder, decent tip, doesn't overheat or burn.The only con is that there is no stand but a cheap piece of metal you can bend, which often falls over.Overall, good for the price."
2,Hot,"This soldering iron does a good job The only problem is that I burnt my fingers while using it. I am not a novice, just not used to a long hot shaft on a pencil iron!"
2,Good but no adjustments,"Subject line says it all. When I used it , it burned the board and the printed copper on that board came off which lead me to buy another board. Don't buy if you really want a professional grade iron. Buy one with finer granularity for heat adjustment. The only reason i gave it 2 stars is that it shipped on time, cheap and it heated pretty fast. I had to keep it for too long just to heat the solder by which time the printed copper came off the board."
1,DON'T BUY IT!,"First one I got did not hold solder on the tip. During the exchange process one of the several included reasons was ""WON'T HOLD SOLDER ON THE TIP"". After SEVERAL emails I was promised a replacement but it didn't come. When contacted, they said ""WE FORGOT"". Replacement held solder on the tip FOR A SHORT TIME and NO LONGER DOES. I may buy a replacement tip at Radio Shack if they are cheap, or I'll return this for refund. CHOOSE A DIFFERENT ONE FROM A DIFFERENT COMPANY on WONDERFUL AMAZON and save yourself some aggravation. P.S.: my 20 year old Weller and my previous stick iron (which fell apart after MANY years) has/had no problem holding solder on the tip. Sorry for the LONG review. BETTER THAN AGGRAVAION!"
3,not quite what i expected,"Iron has large tip, difficult to maneuver. gets overly hot. Seems cheaply made. It worked well for what i need."
5,Really Easy,"I learned to solder with a pretty crappy iron and i decided it was time to get a new one. the difference is incredible! for this price, I was completely happy with product. the only slight issue i found was that after about 20 minutes the handle gets a little hot near the base, but i just shifted my grip."
4,"The Grubby times are coming, are you ready?","What can I say, it's a great Book. This book contains the most comprehensive guide to practical bullet proofing that I have been able to find. I also appreciated the well thought out, easy to understand illustrations."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this book hoping to learn more about the different types and ways science and surveillance are being used in todays world. I did not expect to read the same repetitive and paranoid ideas over and over again in every chapter. The authors drown the reader in paranoia about how everyone and everything is tracked through the use of computer chips. They offer no supporting evidence. We're merely suppose to take their word for it when they write like two paranoid schizophrenics? Needless to say I was rather disappointed with the style in which this book was written. Very little of this book had anything interesting enough to say that wasn't drowned out by conspiracy and paranoia. If this is a subject you're interested in, I highly recommend you find another book."
3,not a very helpful tub!,"This tub doesn't have any support for the baby's head, especailly when they can't sit up on their own yet. I have to constantly hold my daughters head to prevent it from falling to the side of the tub which has no paddings. And where she sits in the tub curves too much where she looks like a little ball and I'm not able to sit her forward or anything to wash her back because she doesn't have any more room to bend in the tub. I don't know how to describe it in details, but I just recommend all the moms and dads to just walk by this tub when you see it in the store!"
4,I liked it.,"This little tub worked well for us and my son always enjoyed his baths. It was compact for storage, easy to use, and comfortable. The tub fit well in my kitchen sink and was at a good height where I felt comfortable turning him around and picking him up. The padding in the tub also helped prevent him slipping. I did see the potential for getting little feet stuck, but I always paid attention so I never had trouble with that. The only drawback is that my son outgrew it when he was about 4 months old, but for the money it's not that big a deal. There are certainly way more expensive baby items that you use and get about 4-6 months use out of them."
1,too dangerous for babies,"This bathtub collapsed in the sink and folded up on my baby! No stars would be more accurate. The locking mechanism is apparently very cheap plastic because it stretched and snapped off, scaring me and terrifying my darling boy. Luckily, I had a good hold on him so he wasn't hurt.I called Safety 1st (ironic brand name) and they said they'd never had a complaint about this product--some of the other reviews contradict that information. They also told me the tub should have been resting on the bottom of the sink rather than being supported by the sides. My sink would have to be 5"" deep for that to be possible! How many people have a kitchen sink that shallow? I actually loved this bathtub before it collapsed, it was convenient and just the right size. But there are so many other more sturdy tubs available--never again will I sacrifice quality for convenience when my baby's safety is at stake."
1,Terrible!,"I bought this tub before my son was born, thinking it looked great and I could use it in the kitchen sink. I do like that I can use it in the sink, but he's not a super long baby and his little feet always get stuck in the grooves where the tub folds! It doesn't hold much water, either. I wish I had read reviews before I bought it, because now, after only 2 months, I'm just going to replace it and throw it away. What a waste!"
2,didn't like too hard to hold baby in it,i am a new mom so maybe that is the reason I don't like the tub. it is too high of an angle to wash a newborn. it is too hard to hold the baby with one hand and wash with the other. maybe when she gets older and has head control it will be better
3,Average tub,I got this tub as a gift at my baby shower. I didn't do much looking around when I registered for it. I thought it would be a great tub since it folded up for storage. Well I would say the only good feature to the tub is that it folds up. I did some looking around and I never thought that finding a good tub with be so difficult. Well I have kept the tub long enough my daughter is now six months and we are going to go tub shopping for something better. The tub did fulfill my need for the first few months but it is time for a new one. Oh the other plus side to the tub is that it fits in my kitchen sink perfectly and well that saves on your back big time not to mention it gets bathtime done more efficiently. I would recommned this tub if finding space for an infant tub is an issue.
1,1 month old and collapsed with child in it,I purchased this item 1 month ago and my son is 1 month old and it collapsed into the sink with my son in it. do not buy this product.
3,Cold toes!!,"We bought this tub because the cloth one we had before got a musty smell to it if you didn't machiene wash it after every bath. We liked the ease of cleaning this tub, and how it folds up to store nicely. I didn't experience any problems with leaking, (only with splashing, as my daughter likes to waive her arms in the tub). On the downside, my daughter is only 8 weeks old and 24 inches long.. her legs drape up and over the tub and her feet are FREEZING during bathtime eventhough we keep a heater blowing on us the whole time. As she has gotten stronger, she will bend her knees and get her legs inside the tub where she quickly pushes off the upslope and nealy catapolts herself from the tub. She has more than once ended up hitting the hard plastic sides with her face when she turns her head to look around, despite the fact that I always have a hand on her.I guess, bottom line the tub is OK for the money and for small, lethargic babies with genetically warm feet."
3,Great for the first two months...,"I think this bathtub is great for the first couple months, it's great that it folds for easy storage,fits great in my double sink, the baby is secure, the problem I had was once my son turned three months I could see there is not much room for a growing baby, and now at four months his legs hang over the rinsing compartment and he looks very uncomfortable so i will have to buy another tub because it will be two months before he can sit up on his own, another thing now that he moves around alot he gets his fingers caught in the hinge area alot, thankfully without injury but it can be difficult to remove when they decide to grip once their fingers are caught..The price is great but i will have to replace it, so I think it would of been better to spend the extra money in the beginning."
4,Great Starter Tub,"I liked the idea of having a tub that could fold up because as you all know by now when you have a baby around you have lots and lots and lots of stuff too. In any event, it was on my registry and it is great. It really isn't all that comfortable because there isn't enough padding but you can buy a teddy bear sponge to go inside and it makes it more comfy, especially for newborns. It does close up and stores nicely. It is one of the best things from Safety 1st. I have several of their other items and they are all horrible but this is definitly pretty good"
2,"Convenient to store, not to use","This tub is very convenient to clean and store, and I like the less-slippery material that lines the inside where the baby sits. However, my squirmy girl has gotten her feet trapped under the hinges which leads to very panicky screaming (hers) and much concern about the safety of the product (mine). It's also a pretty shallow tub, which makes it hard to keep the baby warm and happy during her bath. We're changing to a simpler (no folding, converting, etc.) plastic tub where she can't get her feet stuck."
1,for the trash!,"I have to say that I really thought this would be a great tub while my son was really tiny and the fact that it folds up compactly meant that it wouldn't be in the way all the time. WRONG! My son and I both hated the tub. It was hard to rinse the back of his head and forget about trying to wash his backside without a fight! Also, he slipped around in it. I would roll up hand towels and put them on both sides to keep him from slipping. For a long time, I thought he hated baths, not true. Once I started realizing that this tub was really difficult to use, no matter what I tried, I started bathing with my son and he loved it. We continued this until he could sit in a bath ring.The bottom line - Safety 1st should be ashamed to have their name on this product."
5,Successfully bathed 2 kids in this,"This is a great little tub and a cheap price! Both of my kids were bathed in here, from 4 days old til about 6 months. I used it right in the kitchen sink. The fold up feature is just the best. Its so nice to have it compact between baths and BETWEEN CHILDREN! All the stuff you save to use for 2nd and 3rd kids takes up alot of space. This little jewel is sitting in our laundry room on a shelf for the possibility of a #3 kid. One tip: I always put a cloth diaper under my babies, as I felt like they were less ""slippery"". Our family recommends this little tub."
3,It's okay...,"This tub is great when the baby is tiny, but the infant soon grows out of it and it is difficult to clean the child properly."
3,Not bad...,"I bought this for size convienence. While its folding feature is very useful, I had to buy a bath sponge to put under my son because the foam liner was NOT slip resistant. My son slides all over. It did fit in my sink well, though, and the drain plug is useful. My son is 6mos and 25 inches and is about to grow out of it, but the tub does say 0-6 mos, so I guess it's time for a bath seat. I guess if you decide to purchase it, get a bath pad too!"
1,Uncomfortable tub!,"I am sorry I bought this tub. It is very uncomfortable for my daughter. Used it since she was about 3 weeks old. I have to place a towel behind her head b/c the hard plastic is at such a sharp angle it's uncomfortable. Also, there is a part where she got her foot stuck and she screamed with pain! It's way too small. She's now 4.5 mos and I'm throwing it away b/c she is practically flipping out of it. And the plug is waaaaay too hard to plug - it's an enormous effort to plug it each time.I've switched to the First Years infant to toddler tub and it is way bigger, nicer, more comfortable, and it has no areas to pinch fingers or toes."
1,Worst tub ever,"I received this tub as a shower gift and absolutely hate it! First of all you can barely put any water in it. 2nd, my son is only two months old and can't stretch out his legs in it. 3rd you can barely put any water in it, my son is always freezing. The only good thing is the well in the front that I use for clean rinse water. I wouldn't recommend this tub to anyone."
2,"Okay, but be very careful!","We received this for a shower gift and at first it was great because it fits in the sink and folds for storage under the sink. That being said, my daughters feet almost got stuck in the hinges. We have to stop using it altogether becasue the hinges have snapped underneath so when she was in the tub (over the sink) one of the sides colapsed. I will be writing a letter to the manufacturer and letting them know that this could be very dangerous. We have used the tub for less than 2 months!"
4,I really liked this tub,"I looked at so many tubs, and this one was really great. So many of them are way too big to stash anywhere. We used it in the kitchen sink to save our backs, so of course we wanted it to fold compactly so we could put it away. And I totally agree with the reviewer who said you should have a hold on the baby ALL the time during a bath. Put a washcloth under baby if s/he slides. This tub was an excellent purchase for us."
3,It basically serves its purpose,My son has used this tub for about 3 months. The fact that it folds up is an advantage. It has kept him secure and has eased him into feeling comfortable in water. Now that he is 4 months old he has as out grown it since only a small amount of his body is actually underwater and he now wants to play in the tub.
4,good choice,This tub is a good choice for parents. The fold up construction is a space saver and the rubber liner is comfortable and safe for baby. The only drawback I've come across is it's small. My 4 month old has already out grown it. -jen
2,Beginners and before,The 'Book Level' labeling on this book says it is for 'beginning' & 'intermediate' but I doubt anyone who has used OS X before will be satisfied with what this has to offer. I switched form 10.2 to 10.3 and was not using a book to supplement what Apple provided with 10.2. I thought this would help me get more out of 10.3 and OS X in general. It was one of the first out so I bought it before much else was available. Clearly a mistake on my part and am now looking for something that does more than tell me how to go through a dialog box. I am probably an 'intermediate' level user at best. Someone new to Macs or computers may find it helpful. A wide range of topics is covered but little is added to onscreen instructions or what Apple presents under 'Help.'
5,Breath-taking pants splitter with heart,"How in the world did the cinema forget Harold? It's doubtful that anyone reading this has ever seen one of his movies on television. Even now in the t-shirt age his face is nearly impossible to find. Boy, have you missed a treat. No one defended love, the downtrodden, and the right to get drunk and mess with the cops like Harold. You won't miss the sound and you won't believe your eyes."
4,Another face of Khaled,"I heard Khaled for the 1st time in Sahra, and I just fell in love with the guy's music. I couldn't wait for Kenza, and I find it to be very different from Sahra. There is definitely less of that reggea mix in Kenza, but Kenza is a whole lot more subtle than Sahra, as if Khaled's mood had changed like the wind in the Sahara. Some tracks I absolutely love, like ""C'est la nuit"". This ballad is very soulful and speaks to the heart. All in all, Kenza is another face of Khaled, and that is what I find fascinating, so many artists repeat themselves, it is both refreshing and intriguing to listen to an artist and feel both as if it was a new artist and and old friend."
2,Cheap Binding,"I bought this Bible for an older lady friend with deteriorating vision as a gift. SHe did not have a giant print Bible and it was the thing she wanted most. However, the Bible, for the price, seemed very cheap to me and I was reluctant to give it as a gift. The cover was one of the worst I've seen. The ""leather look"" is just a thin sheet of something over a thin piece of cardboard. The Bible was all right, but everything about it seemed of lesser quality than I would have expected for the price. I have returned it and purchased another one from the same publisher for slight less than half this price! It didn't have thumbtabs which are always nice, but it looks so much better and was a lovely shade of blue. Not recommended. Too expensive for the overall quality. You can do better."
3,An unpleasant surprise,"Man, even though this came out last year I only got this one this year and I was looking forward, in MY honest OPINION ""Focused Daily"" far surpasses this mediocre effort. I am sorry!!! but the quality of Focused Daily defies me to give this a proper review. don't get me wrong this album is nowhere below average it's just that I expected better. Only one song caught my attention, ""Hooks"" , I was kinda hoping that ""Say it twice"" was here. Hell yeah I am comparing this to Focused Daily , growth or not. 3 stars is fair if not generous.The album is very listenable, but if you really felt his previous effort you'll actually feel like you've been ripped off. If you are new to Defari go for Focused Daily."
3,Liza and judy together,i was disappointed in that it did nt include all the numbers from the original album that I used to have years ago. When I purchased it I thought it would be the same album.
4,Real Honky Tonk,"Before he was famous, before he married Faith Hill, Tim McGraw was just a young up and coming country singer. This is still my favorite of all of his albums, maybe it's because it has more of a raw-Country sound, at least to me. These ten songs give good insight into McGraw's roots.All of these songs are keepers. ""Memory Lane"" is probably his greatest known song from this album as it received some airplay. No less a hit is the honky-tonk sounding ""Two Steppin' Mind"", and soulful ""Ain't No Angels"". McGraw shows his humorous side with ""You Can Take It With You (When You Go)"" about his woman taking everything that wasn't nailed down when she leaves (even leaving a hole where the mailbox used to be). He also can pull up emotions with the sorrowful sounds of ""I Keep It Under My Hat"", and ""Tears In the Rain"".If you're a McGraw fan, it will be different than expected. But, if you're a true Country fan, this is a must buy album. This is Country."
1,Don't buy - it's a piece of junk,"The only reason I am giving it one star is because zero stars is not an option. My wife gave me one for my birthday, because the low cost one that I had had for years was getting hard water stains. I wish I had kept the old one.To begin with, the flex rod did not have the strength to hold the mirror in place, so I had to squat down and hug the edge of the shower just to see my face. After about a month, the mirror came loose from the flex rod and was just hanging by the rubber flow tubes that keep it fog free. Now, that same tube has broken at the shower end, sending a large flow of water down the mirror as opposed to through the shower head where it is much more useful.Remember, the second part of Sharper Image is ""Image"" not substance or quality or some other such word."
1,Propaganda from the fundamentalist fringe.,"This is not an objective, scholarly history of the Holy Roman Empire. Rather, it is an attempt by a fundamentalist Christian to misrepresent history for the sake of furthering an agenda. This excerpt is typical: ""While Charlemagne has been criticized for this it must be remembered that paganism and Christianity simply could not coexist together. History had proven this. The pagan gods were vengeful gods who could never accept the idea of monotheism.""I think it is pretty deceptive of the publisher not to indicate somewhere on the cover that this book was intended as a religious polemic rather than as serious history."
3,"good movie, dragged too much in the middle to give it a 4","Now the movie starts off SUPER cool and will have you hooked all the way. Then we find out we are really going to be staying with Granny for a while. You will see what I mean. If this movie does not captivate you in the first 30 minutes, you should not watch moives.So the story is about 2 cops who have to track down a SERIOUS bad dude. This guy does not play a big role but when he does show up, man is he scary. He is the type of character that will shoot someone if they look at him the wrong way, and the look in this guys face really sells it. Also the 2 main cop actors are very good, as was Granny.Now the story does DRAG but it picks back up at the end and left me totally confused but happy becasue it was still a good all around movie.I have the mei eh version of this and the picture quality is perfect, widescreened, and REALLY good subtitles."
1,Bad role modeling,"I received this book as a gift for my son. I right away liked the illustrations and the fact that it rhymed, but a couple of passages in the text were bad enough for me throw it out.Books that encourage little children dislike any animal, in this case snakes, rats, bats, bees, and even gnats and fleas, should never get published. Or veggies: I am glad my son likes peas, but why teach him that peas are something to dislike?Instead of teaching children cliches about nasty children who pull hair, call you names, spoil games, draw on walls etc., the authors should be a bit more thoughtful and explain why some children do things that are wrong. Who has not wished to let him/herself go and draw on walls? Does this make one a nasty child? Sadly the author seems to think so.One star for the art, but cross out the text and make up your own. Or throw it out, but don't pass it on to other children. No one should be reading this."
2,"At first fairly helpful, but later on horrible!","The text in the book was actually pretty much well orgainized, to the point and insightful, it seemed to be pretty much the parts of my european history text book which if i was allowed i would highlight. However this was the only pro. of the entire review. It has been the worst review book i've ever purchased, the multiple choice questions as well as the essay questions are completly unlike those on the AP test. The book's sample questions highlight exactley the wrong topics! Stick to Princeton Review's AP guides, those work much much better."
3,Nice political outline ... not much more...,"After purchasing most of the major AP Euro reviewers, all i can say is that Barron's is a mediocre choice. As a test-prep, it has chapter-by-chapter review questions and sample essays to keep help self-test yourself during the school year and right before the AP exam. As an actual subject reviewer, however, the text is painfully thin... while the maps and time lines are marginally helpful, i would strongly reccommend Vialt's 'Modern European History' as a suppliment. (It's a solid and comprehensive SUBJECT reviewer)"
2,Not a Good Review,"For the past 2 weeks I've been reviewing for the AP Euro History exam with both the Barrons and Princeton review books. The Barrons book complicates some of the most simple subjects in History, and fails to point out the ""big picture"". The essays also fail to provide an accurate representation of an essay that a high school student would write. The Princeton Review book is definitely my top choice."
2,"not good at all, go for princeton review","bad questionswrong informationi haven't looked at the essay, but some of the information is so wrong (modern-nation of Czechloslovakia!?) and/or misleading, you'd be better off without it. For other classes (esp. Bio), CliffsAP is quite nice, especially for regular tests."
3,Not the best,"""Stone of Cold Fire"" is the third LBT video my family has seen. My 3 year old son loves the series, but was less interested in this video. He enjoyed the adventure storyline, but was confused by the quasi-theology of the ""mysterious beyond."" The movie would be much better without the sub-plot of the mysterious dinosaurs, who might be space aliens, angels, or, as my husband joked, Scientologists."
5,Barbie and Elmo,"My daughter loves Barbie and Elmo. What a great way to get the best of both worlds! Now Barbie can ""play"" with Elmo while my daughter plays with hers!!! What a great idea and little Elmo even giggles! I am so glad they became available again before Christmas!!"
4,Saint Germain Novels always a winner,"""Better in the Dark"" does not have the fast pace that many of the early Saint Germain novels have. However, as any true fan of the deliciously mesmerizing count, I could not put it down. Many will be put off by the historical content and details, but I found that it is those attributes that make Yarbo's books so compelling and realistic. It is a welcome change from the over-done kill/maim, I-want-to-drink-your-blood and oh-do-I-have-a-soul? vampires. Like many Saint Germain fans, I will read any book containing the count that I can get my hands on, and I have never been disappointed. This is no exception.V. Canfield"
2,"Boring, no interesting characters, no vampire stuff, dull!","You call this a Horror novel, a novel about a vampires, what a joke! This book is probably the worst book I have ever read. Not one character was memorable, the ending was uninteresting, and it doesn't leave the reader looking forward to the next one.Too wordy and redundant talk among the characters. This is the first and last book I purchase from this author."
4,Great play dishes,My 3 and 1 1/2 year olds play with these dishes every day together with their play food. The dishes are the perfect size for little ones and very sturdy. They are fun to stack and use and they wash easily. They are nicely colored and work well for boys and girls. Perfect for little kids- just store the plastic knives and forks until your kids are ready to play safely with them- though my kids have the entire set out and we have no problems playing safely with little supervision.
2,Not as good as World Series,"This game would have been the best if it incorporated the in depth franchise mode that World Series Baseball has. The developing players, the salary cap, contracts, etc...the graphics are top notch, but the gameplay is still to arcade like. Too many runs, not enough pitching, and unrealistic pitch speeds.. (John Burkett pitching 96 mph?) Anyways, I will stick with WSB until these problems are straightened out."
3,Read this before you buy,"As I opened my brand new ALL STAR BASEBALL 2003 FEATURING DEREK JETER I was biting my fingernails hoping for this game to be better than TRIPLE PLAY 2003 which I had just returned (TRIPLE PLAY is the worst baseball game I've ever played). And it was in every aspect except for game time. The graphics are decent and the overall fun of the game is good but it takes an hour and a half to play one game which makes it very difficult to play all, some or even a few games in a season. Franchise mode is great but as I said you'll end up simulating half the games because they take so long to play. RENT BEFORE YOU BUY SEE IF YOU CAN STAND TO SIT IN FRONT OF YOU XBOX FOR ONE OR TWO HOURS."
5,Opposing Viewpoints on Child Abuse,This book is an excellent collection of articles using data and statistics to support opposing views. Highly recommend it.
5,The only Broadway Musical type Anime out there!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this series when I saw it at a friends house, which is why when I heard its production is being discontinued I bought the series before they ran out. I'm a big fan of musicals so I like this Nerima Daikon Brothers a lot. Its fun, meta-aware of itself and has some catchy tunes. They reuse the score for different songs but you'll be having so much fun you won't care. Warning gags in the series have sex jokes or puns so this is not for kids but older teens or adults. It is worth the price so buy a copy.It is about two brothers and their cousin who dress like the Blues Brothers trying to get enough money to build a concert dome to perform where their diakon field is now. They constantly get scammed by bad guys, get help from a rental guy white with an Afro who always has the right object to help them beat the crooks and steal their money, but they always lose it by the end of the episode. Its fun and full of laughs."
5,Easy To Apply,"I hate how most sunblocks get all ""goopy"" when you put them on. This sunblock goes on smoothly and seems to work well on my children."
4,Awesome Skin...but don't plan to take it off..,"I was researching iskins, and found that this was the best. It is a little difficult to put on, but fits very snuggly and has good grip. The thin membrane over the click wheel is great,and the plastic face protecting the screen is a great idea, NOTHING is going to get in the ipod. I didn't know why there is a button covering the entire hold button area, but as long as u have a nail you can move it back and forth without too much of a problem.The only problem I have with it is that it is not meant to be taken off and on too many times. I got an ipod boom box for Christmas and had to remove the skin so it would fit in the dock, then when I went to put the skin back on for a trip, it fits a little looser than it did before, it seems like it stretches a little bit when you take it off.Great skin, as long as you plan to never take it off."
4,Nice Jacket!,"This jacket is light, warm, and of very high quality. The only complaints I have is that the arm pit vents are not netted (wide open when unzipped) and it is a little loud (that swishy sound). Overall, very happy with quality of material and design."
3,Thin - but works,"Bought this for a trip to England. There is no fabric/lining in it - so expect it to be more of a plastic coat (poncho like). The inside has some kind of material on it that seems like it could scratch off easily (I assume its what helps it make it waterproof?). Works as stated though, probably good to roll up easily and not take up much space. But if you were looking for a soft lined coat - this is not it. You would need to wear layers to keep warm as there is no insulation."
4,Pretty good over all.,"This jacket is rainwear, NOT made for very cold whether. It's very water resistant you can see the little rain drops on it even. I like it but it doesnt keep me warm enough. I need more layers."
2,Rehash/repackaging of older songs - For Completists Only,"As an early Byrds, Burritos and then Desert Rose fan, I've been known to obessively serach for new material.I was able to pick this up at a reasonable cost, but was disappointed that it is short, poorly mastered, and seems to be a repackaging of traditional songs from other releases.Note, it says all original recordings, which they are. What it omits is that they are not new releases or even unique to this album.There are other and much better value DRB albums - stick to those."
3,Lessons Learned,"Life cannot be easy for developmentally disabled adults. It's also not easy for their families. The reader sees both sides of the coin in Simon's story of spending 12 months with her mentally retarded sister, doing what Beth loves best -- riding the city's buses.Simon, a high-powered writer and college instructor, must deal with her own feelings of anger and inadequacy -- anger at her sister's stubborn resistance to making the ""right"" choices, and inadequacy at accepting her for who she is.During the twelve months, she gains an appreciation for the everyday challenges and discrimation her sister faces, as well as an envy of Beth's ability to forge strong relationships with strangers.A worthy book, if a little drawn-out and slow in spots."
5,Lexar 8gb CF,Outstanding CF card. All went well ... from purchase through delivery. Card performs as advertised.
3,Good comedy.,I had this on VHS orginally and wore it out. Glad to see it on DVD. Classic 90's movie.
5,Glad we ordered this movie!,"Absolutely love this movie. Ed O'Neill and Ethan Randall were perfect for their roles. Very entertaining, made us love and hate the kid at the same time."
4,Another comedy!,"Arrived quicker than expected and in excellent condition. This movie is a comedy and pretty funny. If you like watching funny movies, this one is one for the watching. Not as good as I was told it was, but worth watching."
4,Overlooked Classic,"""Dutch"" is one of my favorite John Hughes films. It pretty much follows Hughes's pattern of conflict established early on, struggles to resolve the conflict, and a feel-good ending. I'm a sucker for happy endings. This is a good movie to show to a preteen who is disrespectful to his parents and other adults. It often opens his eyes to his bad behavior."
4,Surprising,"I'm sure anyone watching this will see the similarities between it and Planes, Trains, and Automobiles. I expected the same. And, although there are quite a few similarities, and it's rather predictable, still it's a pretty good movie to watch. I like John Hughes movies, and this one is no exception. I didn't know Ethan Embry was in this.. a young T.B. Player! :) Cute movie, nice story."
3,"Married With ""Annoying"" Children","This movie would have been much better if the 12 year old wasn't such an ""old fart."" Ed O'Neill is fine as Dutch but the only reason to watch is the great ten minutes put in by Ari Meyers. She plays a call-girl who (with her friend) picks up Dutch and the brat who are stranded in the cold. Best bet: Rent ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles"" instead."
5,Very Good,"Good book! Wonderful characters, humorous dialogue, and an interesting plot make this a very enjoyable read.My Lady NotoriousTempting Fortune (Malloren Family)Something WickedSecrets of the NightDevilishWinter Fire"
3,Review,"Okay, this is a good product, that is if you can set it up right. The pieces are vary fragile and can break VERY easy. For me to set up the cage I had to use string, but it all worked out. Another thing is it only comes with enough pieces to put up 1 platform, so if you want to put up the other one you got to buy more pieces. Another thing is that the tubes them self are not the greatest quality and don't snap into their place right.On the upside:-The cage is really big and looks really good assembled-Their are plenty of little things that make buying the cage worth it-Because the hamster usually can climb the walls, assembling the tubes isn't really necessary"
4,borderline.,"Borderline classic. Louis Dorley kills mics. I love his humor, wit, punchlines, concepts, flow, and production. Sin-A-Matic is a great start to Logic if you dont know too much about him. This album is also a good start to underground hip hop.Highly reccomended. Borderline Classic.Check Louis LIVE too."
5,One of the best hip hop albums of 2003,"I hope people don't see the comparisons to Eminem and pass on this record. Eminem and Louis Logic share one thing -- they're both white. Besides that, nothing is similar about their styles.Logic has a strong voice, and while his production is more polished on this disc, the beats are mostly of the pure underground variety. There's also a good blend of straightforward rhyming with clever wordplay, metaphors and battle-worthy punches.There are a few tracks that fall off, but overall this is one of those albums that will claim permanent rotation in your CD player if you like intelligent, underground hip hop."
2,Hitting?,"The hitting interface in this game is awful. When the computer throws fastballs up in the corner or anywhere besides the target, then you can't hit it. What I do is wait for a pitch to come down the middle and swing the bat. I wish I could get my money back for this piece of trash. I mean, how fun is a game where you can't hit the ball??? Akklaim needs some help."
2,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,This game is pretty cool until it won't let you hit ball. The graphics are good but it is not worth your money and time. Don't buy it. I could never figure out how to steal bases. Controls are confusing.
2,OK but could be better,"I rented this game one time just to check it out to see how it compared to other baseball games. I was very disapointed. The graphics were awesomes. I could tell the difference between A-rod and Ichiro. The game really messed up with the gameplay. It is almost impossible to hit the ball. Fielding isn't any better. It's really hard to get your guy under the ball. Another flaw was that the controls were really complicated and almost every time I pitched and the guy hit it, the fielder would always throw it home. One other problem I noticed was that the fielder after getting the ball usually waits about 3 seconds to throw after you tell him were to throw it. I recommend Triple Play for someone who wants more of an arcade type game but if you want a simulation game them this games for you."
1,return this now,All Star Baseball 2003 is one of the most overrated baseball game I have ever played. It is almost impossible to hit the ball. And when your in the field and A batter hits a fly ball the camera trys to look real by moving in slowly and if its a line drive it will go past you. On rookie mode the ball comes in so fast its almost impossible to hit the ball. To many strikeouts and too little game play. In the instruction manual it tells you nothing.
1,Dr. 90210 - The Complete First Season,"Dont be suprised if this dvd is familiar. its the same show you saw on E!. Dont expect ANYTHING extra. The dvd is edited just like the show, you dont see anything. Dont expect to see the real footage of the show. LAME LAME LAME* Never-before-seen Footage -- BIG DEAL* Lighter moments and outtakes -- WHO CARES"
4,Beautiful but slightly damaged,"This book is fantastic - the photos are absolutely beautiful, and the quotes/scriptures very inspiring. The only thing that is to the detriment of this product is that when I received it, the beautiful glossy cover was 'ratty' around the edges, slightly torn in the corner, and creased. It was a gift, so I had to try ironing the cover to straighten it out and make it look presentable!"
3,A fair effort from a fine photographer,"Familiar as I am with the photographers' work, I was disappointed overall with this debut which offers a study of scripture illustrated by nature photographs. It is a book that deserved MUCH better production than it received.For the price,theArt of God is a decent gift, but if you want to see what it could and should have been like, for such a lofty theme,check out another christians'book which really accomplishes the grand display of God's Creation and thus a sense of His perfection:""Intimations of Paradise "". ""Intimations"" is the book ""Art of God "" should have been."
1,2000 mg is too much,"February 13 studies recommended a smaller dose of calcium and linked excess calcium with heart disease. Of course, I bought these prior to reading that study. These pills are large and solid and hard to swallow, not like the barefoot calcium I previously bought. I do not recommend."
5,Excellent Set.,This set of cookware is the easiest set to clean that I have ever seen. The price was Excellent ($60). The pans are the best I have ever used and I couldnt ask for better. Although the smallest one is quite small. The small pot is also pretty small so I dont use either of them very often. But I am extremely happy with this buy.
5,if you love hardcore techno...this one's for you,"i used to own this disk until it was stolen from me a while ago...and have been searching the world over looking for it. i'm a big fan of hardcore techno, the faster the better. i found this comp to be the best. all tracks are well above par and it never gets boring. very creative beats and use of samples. nothing more needs to be said...if you love hardcore techno...this one's for you."
3,Kill Memory Crash - When The Blood Turns Black,"Kill Memory Crash keeps the spirit of EBM alive with their short EP, WHEN THE BLOOD TURNS BLACK. ""Inside the Box"" has a dark electro groove to it, like a knife fight between Front Line Assembly and Afrika Bambaataa. ""Throw Up Your Mind"" is more upbeat, and ""Come Alive"" returns to the robotic, hard-edged beats and vocodered vocals. The grinding of gears slows for ""SP-Fluid,"" but ""Technasty"" comes back with all pistons firing: an aggressive track, filled with hiss and spite. Short, but with the sharpness of a pocket knife."
3,Is it just me???,"Or do other people think there is a need for creativity in user interface design? This book, while very helpful in providing a set of procedures to follow when evaluating users and their particular needs, leaves out the very important concept of the ART of user interface design. I see plenty of recommends for Tufte's trilogy of user oriented design books and for the book ""Don't Make Me Think"". These books are much more readable, and none of them are nearly so formulaic in their approach to user interface design.Another problem I have with this book, and with many other computer books, is the size. Why does it take so much to say so little? Is there an editor in the house? There is definitely some good content in this book. I happens to be buried in a mountain of text."
5,First bite always leads to more.,"There's something about these that's just plain addictive. My first bite (a 4 pound one bought for my wife) made me think...meh, it's alright..then I took another..then I ate like 5 in a row, LOL!!They really are good, and like I said, you'll want more.We finished the 4 pound container off a few weeks ago, and then I ran across this CHEAPER at the time 5 pound container!! Ordered and enjoying!"
5,Red Vines! Need I say more?,"IF you like red vines, then this is the way to buy them.If you have never had red vines, only swizzlers, I warn you that they taste very different and have a very different texture.Swizzlers are really fruity to me where red vines have a more ""licorice"" taste. They are not as soft as swizzlers, more chewy. That being said, I prefer them to swizzlers any day of the year."
