4,Classic MHC - with a twist,"This time, our beleaguered heroine is writing in the first person (so, barring someone having found her journal post mortum, we know that she is going to come out alive.) Twenty-two years after her teenage sister&#65533;s brutal murder, a death for which she still harbors some good Old-Fashioned Catholic Guilt, Ellie Cavnaugh is a true crime news reporter/book writer, who has come home to avenge her sister&#65533;s death &#65533; or at least oppose the release of the boy-man convicted of her murder. The characterization is good and the suspense is vintage Clark. But, like in the movie *Scream,* why is it that characters in these vehicles don&#65533;t know The Rules as well as the audience? WE know not to agree to meet an unknown person alone, in the dark, in an unfamiliar back alley!"
2,Distraught and Disappointed,"This book was a very disappointing read. I found it to be bland and predictable. You know from the first few chapters what was going to happen. There was nothing to pull the reader in and the only reason you would finish it would be because you would feel some type of obligation to yourself to finish what you started. The author leads you on a long and tedious path only to end it where you already knew what happened.The only reason I gave it two stars was because of the emotional and spiritual growing ""Ellie"" does."
4,Trying to find you before he finds me,"When Ellie was 7 years old her sister Andrea was brutally murdered. It was Ellie who found her sister's body, and slipping in Andrea's blood ran to tell her parents. Now, 23 years later, Andrea's suspected murderer Rob Westerfield is released from prison. Ellie is trying to prove Rob guilty of second degree murder to send him back to prison forever. The murderer is out there waiting to kill and Ellie is his next target.The queen of suspense, Mary Higgins Clark, has a masterpiece in Daddy's Little Girl, a thrilling tale of murder, mystery and suspense with realistic characters and a chilling climax. WARNING:If you pick up this book you won't be able to put it down."
4,kid's love it,It is a very entertaining yet educational tool. The kids really enjoyed playing it. Ranks up there with Jumpstart as a quality program for education while entertaining as well.
5,Great tool for centers,"This book is a great tool for my reading center. I can pick and choose pages to add depending on the skills we are working on and differentiate based on ability. Students can have similar reading contacts and I can differentiate through the level and content of text they read, too. My students love the predictability and the fact that they can work at their own pace. It makes planning a breeze!"
5,"Finally, found a book with authentic homecooking recipes!","My parents are from Hong Kong and I was born in Canada. I grew up with the foods Ms. Young describes in her book, but because of my limited ability to read Chinese, I have never been able to follow any Chinese recipe books written in Chinese. When I first bought this book, my aunts thought it was pretty funny. They said ""how can a book that is written in English be authentic?"" - and considering my spoken Cantonese is accompanied with a fairly strong ""Canadian"" accent, they were sure the book was full of ""westernized"" Chinese foods. Well, after looking through the book themselves, they were sold and bought their own copies.The recipes are good. But what I find most helpful is the inclusion of the Chinese name for the dishes and some ingredients - written in Chinese characters and translated phoentically into ""English""(between the combination, I can usually figure out the dish or ingredient and relate it back to what my Mom used to prepare)."
4,A new legend is born,"If you can say that writing a book is quite simple then creating a myth can be a really tough job. It is difficult to know where to use your fantasy and where to use pure historical facts. I guess for Stephen Lawhead, his job would have been extremely difficult since his competitors have been establishing their fantastic view for centuries now and have created the most world famous legends heard and told. Despite the difficultness, Lawhead has done surprisingly well!! He has put history in its right position! A new legend is born,new characters find their positions next to King Arthur and readers'fantasy advances to a higher level. New tragic and heroic tales shall be sang by all the modern bards.I hope that the sequels prove to be as thrilling and legendary as this book"
5,An epic tale of an epic legend,"What an astoundingly good epic read.As a prospective writer I found this book amazing for resting and relaxing as well as a how to guide of how to write time lapses, logically and coherently in about 50 different ways.The characters show real growth and in such an epic read it is a continual growth process not a onetime thing.This is really one of the best ever epic fantasy books I have read in a very long list of books in this genre, I will most assuredly recommend this to all fantasy genre lovers.I ""read"" this on audio and the mastery of the narrator . . . was worthy of a review and another 5 * review all on its own.WaAr"
5,Into the myths of old,"I really enjoy Stephan Lawhead's writings. He does a lot of research into myths of old and adds imaginative twists on them! In this book He is weaving two stories together so that you are caught in the midst. This story is the precursor to the Arthur legends. He causes one to feel the wind, the heat, the dirt and the cold of those bygone days! Its a great adventure!"
5,The Lost World of Myth,"Taliesin by: Lawhead puts the reader into a world the has long been forgotten in fact but not in myth. It gives a truely magnificient sensation of feelings as you plow into the pages of history. Eventhough this reading is fiction, it has many well known ""facts"" that are sewn into the words. The spark of life is given to the characters through the words of Lawhead and they do not lose their potency throughout the story. This novel of celtic tradition and roman legend will capture you and push you to the limits of the imagination."
4,good but a bit long,"I think this was a good book. It has a good beginning and a good ending, but some of the middle couldv'e stood to be left out. It took me awhile to read this book because I lost interest about halfway through, but I hate leaving books unfinished, and I'm glad I didn't because the ending was great. I found that the Merlin book of this cycle was a bit like that too. Just know that when you read it, there's going to be a bit of a flat stretch but it gets better and it is definitely worth reading just to get into the rest of the books if nothing else! I do like the spin of Atlantis though, very interesting."
4,Excellent idea,"Love the pictures of food making the letters, especially when it can be presented with the food present. Involves several senses. Only inconsistence I see is between the letter names vs sounds, though I acknowledge it is difficult to represent all foods starting with just the letter sounds (phonics). Overall a great little book."
4,WOW! in WoW,"Adding this keyset makes the game easier by placing most of the essential functions within reach. Playing the game will be much easier when everything is clearly labeled. Most of the commands are in a separate area to the right of the main keyboard layout which makes it easier to concentrate on the game and not on setting and activating keystrokes and combinations.There is one review that really brings this keyset and keyboard down, but who wants to take the time to manually map out each and every option and feature to the keys of a regular keyboard. Not only is it time consuming, but also playing the game can be harder trying to remember where that key you programmed was.Other features of the keyset are the raised arrow keys on the right where the preset functions are. Due to the shape and size, make character movements much easier than moving your character with standard arrow keys found on a regular keyboard."
3,"$30 less at home depot, not even on sale.","Excellent sawhorse, but much like the adjustable dewalt single horse, these guys seem to think they can gouge you online. Don't let them. Any item like this, do the legwork and compare. A 50% difference, not even a sale price, somebody is playing you for a sucker. That said, it was close but ii like the dewalt."
4,Stanley Adjustable Work Supports,"The product works well, and meets my expectations. The packing it received, however, before shipment, could have been improved: the supports were simply wrapped in corrugated paper secured with tape, then shipped. On arrival, the package was split open, and the UPS driver and I were concerned to make sure all the parts were present - they were, but the reverse could easily have been the case. So - good product, but a relatively poor shipping experience. However, I am happy with the order because nothing was missing and the product as ordered arrived and works well - all's well that ends well, eh?"
2,limited,"I received this muffin pan for a gift. It's a nice pan in many ways but I would have never purchased it myself. First of all, the price is high. It's very heavy which has pros and cons...won't warp like super light-weight pans but when filled with batter it is really heavy. The ends are extended to provide handles but because of this it can only go in a standard oven length-wise. If you put it in side-by-side with another pan, it is too long and the door will not close. Lastly, it is only useful for muffins as the cups are not large enough to accommodate paper cupcake holders. The paper cups fold in and do not make nice round cupcakes. The positive is that the non-stick coating is nice and it produces beautiful muffins. All in all it's not a multipurpose pan, it's too heavy for my liking, it's too expensive and it takes up too much space in the oven...not a winner in my book. I suggest looking elsewhere."
4,"You know, the U.S. isn't that bad after all...","Jeezus, are there places in the world like this? Is this an exaggeration for shock value? What year is this, anyway? Well, it's a very good movie, as movies go. Parts of it are very intense. Wow. There is a healthy amount of violence, so be ready for that. If I was convinced that this movie was an accurate portrayal of this culture, I would have many things to say, but who really knows? If it is, then I am very happy that I was born in the U.S. I make this statement as someone who is not a flag-waver, a my-country-right-or-wrong, fat, spoiled, Wal-Mart-shopping American. Any-who, I recommend this movie, because, as I said before, it is very, very good."
2,Mixed feelings,"I purchased this watch based on the great reviews that it had received and great price, but i had a bit different experience. I guess in this instance, you get what you pay for. Don't get me wrong, i love this watch's design and feel on the wrist wearing it daily. I will go over my experiences with this product in a pro/con manner.Pros:Easily adjustable to get the right sizeVery thick and beautiful band with each of the links engraved with the Invicta nameGreat feel on the hand, does not pull on arm hair or pinch skinScrew-in locking ability of adjuster knobsCons:Thin and somewhat flimsy latch mechanismStationary dial paint in the engraving has slowly worn awayVery susceptable to scratches on the face; 4 after 2 months of daily wearStainless steel band links show significant scuffing and wear after only 2 months of wearCheap internals, losing seconds after a monthLack of precise second hand movementOdd chronograph setup"
1,Seconds hands misaligned on arrival,"The seconds hands of the watch, on arrival, was misaligned. I am returning it to Amazon and getting a different brand watch. The watch repair center I went to said the internals were most likely also not correct and I should just return it to Amazon rather than opening it up and having it repaired."
3,Great but very hideous pattern,"Chair is very comfortable, the sunshade works well and the drink holder is great. I ordered the brown color, the chair shows up as a brown/black with a hint of gold pattern. Frankly it is quite disgusting looking. I wish Amazon shows a bigger and more detailed picture on the website, I would not have bought it if I know that is the pattern. Also, be careful when you try to slide the chair back, make sure your fingers are not underneath the armrests, the moving mechanism can catch and cause some serious damage to your fingers."
4,No Directions but great Chair,"This chair looks great and seems very high quality. Shipping was a little slow- it took 2 weeks to arrive. It came right out of the box ready to go except for the head pillow. Unfortunately, there were no directions in the box for how to lock the chair in place. I am not mechanically minded and frankly, I break a lot of things trying to figure them out. Directions or just a diagram would have been helpful.I am giving this chair to my dad for his birthday and after trying it out myself, I am sure he will love it."
2,"Faddis has range and power, but no class.","This album is a curiosity and a perversion. A well rounded athelete doesn't just have big biceps. Faddis is a one trick pony. Plus, he raps. ""I'm Faddis, I'm the baddest, I'm rap-master J."" Those words burn in my mind eternal. But if you're looking to listen to someone who can play higher than you, you're all set. Also, a few tracks are pretty neat - such as the track where he samples over himself 16 times. That's neat. But that pony only has one trick."
3,Live from the past,"This Beach Boys concert album was recorded at various venues during their Winter 1972 Tour and their Summer 1973 Tour. This was during the brief time period that Bruce Johnston had quit the band, and was replaced by South African musicians Blondie Chaplin and Ricky Fataar. The performances here are good, but none of them match the studio versions of these songs. On the plus side, this was before the Beach Boys became a nostalgia act that just played their biggest hits. So, we are treated to some rare live versions of lesser known songs like ""Sail On Sailor"", ""Trader"", ""You Still Believe in Me"" and ""Funky Pretty"". I wouldn't say this is an essential Beach Boys CD, but it should be of interest to most of their fans."
4,The Real Beach Boys.,"I ordered this album as soon as it was re-released. It is the only chance to hear the real original Beach Boys when they actually took chances with their live material. Just take a look at the playlist-""the trader,Marcella,leaving this town,funky pretty,let the wind blow,we got love"" as well as the usual hits.This was the REAL Beach Boys.The present day group just play the easy surf songs."
3,"Good, But Not As Good as Others","I like this album. It is a good representation of the Beach Boys' 1970s performing career. However, there aren't many early songs on this album, and that is the period of the Beach Boys' career that I am most interested in. I strongly prefer the Knebworth concert from 1980. That one also features all five original Beach Boys. They play a lot more of the older stuff on that recording, like ""Little Deuce Coupe"" and ""I Get Around.""For me, ""Pet Sounds"" was the last good Beach Boys album. Songs like ""Sail On Sailor"" and ""Good Vibrations"" really don't excite me too much. The Beach Boys were going through a very creative period around the time of this concert (1972-73) and I am just not that in to it.Still, if you are a serious Beach Boys fan, you will want this album as a document of this particular era in Beach Boys history."
3,wot no Denny?,"The unquestionable highlight of The Beach Boys during this period of their career was Dennis Wilson...he wasn't stuck behind the drums, after injuring his hand, so co-fronted the group, and played electric piano/synth. I've heard a live recording of his song 'cuddle up', complete with strings AND a spoken word intro from Mike Love chastising the audience for talking over a quiet track and preventing them from artistic growth! Amazing stuff...which makes it all the more inexcplicable that there is NO vocal solo or song written by Denny here...not even as a bonus track.It's a good album, don't get me wrong, just a total missed opportunity, given the key position Dennis occupied at this point in their career, both on record (best songwriter, hands down on their previous four lps) and live..."
1,Not worth it.,"I bought the game based on the positive reviews, and after believing it would be more realistic than the Sid Meier's version. I regret it very much. The learning curve is too high, and it seems you have to have an MBA to understand the stock market function. The interface is confusing as well. I don't mind learning to play a game, but not when it becomes too much of a hassle and too distracting."
1,WARNING! Copy Protection Scheme prevents installation,"The copy protection prevents installation on my machine. I am not alone. I have also read that there are problems for people who are able to get the program installed. I understand the problems with Piracy, but to put down big $ for a game that won't install is the worst."
2,Doesn't have map of US!,"Nice graphics and sound. However, the game doesn't even include a map of the US! The stock market is the same cretin style stock market of the previous game (no matter how much money you have, you can't buy stock from other players). The last and most serious problem is track laying & station placement. There is no un-do. If you make an error (which is easy to do with the weird station placement algorithm), you have to endure a lengthy recreation of the map and reloading all the databases to restore the map. Most games end quickly in frustration."
2,"Fun at first, but it just doesn't have it.",When I first played this game I loved it. It was fun and pretty easy. But after 2 days it put me to sleep. Booooooooooring.
3,This Game Kind of Plays Itself,"Woa! Not nearly as challenging as RT2. Consists are automatically controlled for you. All you need to do is connect a bunch of cities and make money. There's no micro-managing of goods like there was in RT2.The economic model in RT3 really takes center stage. In fact, you can often make a fortune without even laying any track! And I thought this was a railroad game.The bottom line, I bought RT3 to play a railroad game--to manage the railroad itself--not to play the stock market. I haven't been playing RT3 much at all since the first week I had it. Got boring quickly. Curiously though it sparked my interest in RT2 so I've been playing that :)"
1,DO NOT GET THIS,THIS product is not the best quality. I bought it for my boyfriend and almost a month of him wearing it the dial fell off. We called their customer service and they weren't very helpful. We had to pay to ship it and for them to ship it back to. We complained and all we got was that instead of $25 to ship it back to him they will only charge $15. Plus he had to pay for shipping and insurance. Find something else with better quality and better customer service THAT STANDS BY THE PRODUCT THEY SELL.
4,Excellent purchase,"Was told several times it looked like a rolex.Qualitative product, works very well.Purchased from France, received very fast."
1,lagging time,"The watch is nice except it kept falling behind in time. I adjusted it the by the next day it fell behinda couple of hours, so I returned it."
2,"Didn't work, looks cheap to the trained eye","My main watch is an Omega Speedmaster Date, but I needed a blue dial watch to match certain suits that I'd wear maybe a couple of times a month. I wasn't ready to spend another few grand for a watch that I wouldn't wear as often. I kept reading about this watch looking like a Rolex Submariner so I figure I'd try it. I showed some coworkers and they couldn't really tell how much it cost, but if you've ever held a nice watch, you can tell it's cheap. Initially, the band felt really cheap and not very smooth when it moved around. The crown actually comes off when you are setting the time. But the worst thing was that it just stopped working after a few hours. Amazon had a great return process, however, but this watch sucks."
4,ONE COMMENT MISSING,"THERE SHOULD BE A WARNING STATING THAT THE WATCH BAND IS EXTRA LONG AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE SPECIAL TOOL TO SHORTEN IT, YOU SHOULD ORDER IT.FOR THE REST , SHIPPING WAS ON TIME AND THE WATER RESISTANT WATCH DOES WHAT IT'S SUPPOSE TO DO AND WORKS PERFECTLY..."
5,very good for the $$,got this last week liked it so much I got 2 more. I have about 60 invicta's have not had a bad one yet. This one looks great and is keeping good time
4,good style good watch,"I bought this a dress watch but also wanted the waterproof and sporting appearance. The watch band is very large and I had to have 3 links removed. that is not a bad thing as you can be sure it will fit if you have big wrists. I would have given it 5 stars but if you dont wear it every day it stops running, being movement activated you need to wear it."
4,all good,"arrived on time and apparently in good shape. Gift to my kids, they have not launched it yet."
1,DONT BUY IT,"I wish I would have read the reviews first, I agree with everyone. Can't strap it to either my 5 or 7 year old (the whole set-up is just too long, it wont fit on their short little forearms--fits me though!). Silly string shoots fine for the first 5 seconds then becomes a blob at the end of the toy. Of course your kid will hound you for days wanting you to buy more silly string web solution!!!!Water gets one decent stream after pumping it for days, but too much pumping for a 5 year old to do. Junk. Made in CHINA. Even my 5 year old was disappointed. The only redemption is that it makes a ""web-slinging"" noise, so he runs around pretending to fling webs making the web noise. That noise will get on your nerves quick too.Silly me, I bought 2 thinking he would destroy one before Halloween got here (for his costume) and we would have a spare..."
5,The Rosenberg Story,"The Rosenberg Story, while based on a series of articles which originally appeared in ""The Worker"", has been considerably expanded to include much new material. Its publication, just one year after the execution of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, underscores the continuing fight to vindicate the heroic couple whose martyrdom outraged the conscience of all decent mankind, a fight linked today to the rising demand for the freedom of their co-defendent, Morton Sobell.from book's About The Author"
1,Disappointment...,"As any devoted Jack Vance fan knows, Vance's level of focus varies wildly from book to book- from the tightly plotted and well thought out (Lyonesse, The Dying Earth) to gotta-pay-the-bills one-draft hackiness (the Alastor Cluster series).I guess he had to pay some bills with this one."
4,Pretty good story,This is the first in this series of unusual sci fi stories. Vance is pretty interesting. I expect to read more sometime.
3,entertaining,"I couldn't put it down. The characters are variously involved with pursuit of their ideals: most seeking profit, some seeking spiritual enlightenment, or the joy of life through artistry. The main character is uncommitted, kind of like Milo in The Phantom Tollbooth, an inexperienced mild-mannered boy suddenly on a ship of highly experienced rogues. The boy accidentally (?) kills someone. What I like about Jack Vance's writing, is that he simply follows the characters where they will go, and makes no value judgment about them as good or bad. However, I can't make out any themes or purpose. Maybe the purpose is too subtle for me. In any case, I thoroughly enjoyed the ride, and I will buy the sequel as soon as Jack Vance is finished with it."
4,Twist and Shout!,"I bought this used on vinyl record for my mom so I cant really say much about it because Im not really a fan of The Beatles. I did listen to it when she was spinning it and it sounded good. The only song that I really knew on it was Twist and Shout which is the last song on side 2. There are 12 songs over all and playing time is around 27 mins, give or take. It came in a single jacket with a blank inner sleeve. Its on black vinyl with black info labels. If you dont know about this album you should look it up beacuse it has an interesting back story. To make a long story short the copy we have is a counterfeit. Once knowing the story, you will know what that means."
2,THAT'S IT?,THE STORY NEEDED TO BE LONGER OR MAYBE HAVE MORE DETAILS. THE ENDING LEFT ME ANGRY BECAUSE IT JUST ENDED...WHAT HAPPENS AFTER SHE GETS TAKEN AWAY...AND AFTER ONLY ONCE??
3,not brain surgery but not bad for a fun weekend night,"Owen Wilson is funny, as always but you really should go see the Wedding Crashers or Meet the Parents instead"
3,Much better than most reviews would indicate,"Kate Hudson, Matt Dillon and Owen Wilson are all in fine form here. Hudson was adorable, Dillon was mucho serious, and Wilson was the wild child. There were more laughs than I thought and the story moved at a brisk pace. Worth a rental, but I don't care to see it again."
2,Again?,"I like Owen Wilson a lot, but his affable stoner shtick is wearing thin, especially in a formulaic, third wheel romantic comedy that's already been done to death. Matt Dillon is good in just about anything, and he and Kate Hudson have some decent chemistry here. Unfortunately, all the actors are playing roles they've played in other films. There just aren't enough good, original jokes to keep the film running. I give the disc an extra star for the hilarious alternate horror trailer, and Wilson's energetic seminar."
2,Two Stars for the Movie,"The most redeeming thing about this movie was the pretty shade of silver of the DVD. Even the extras were pathetic. This movie is a curiosity due to the fact that Owen Wilson and Kater Hudson ""allegedly"" had a romance blossom. Unlike Mr. and Mrs. Smith where you could see the chemistry between Brangelina, Kate and Owen are boring. A waste of three decent actors. Don't wait for the DVD, wait for the T.V. version one late night when you can't fall asleep."
3,jealous of a slacker,"A newly married man let's his slacker friend move in and then gets jealous that his wife might like her more. It starts out as a good romantic comedy but turns into a seriously boring story. Kate Hudson and Owen Wilson didn't have much chemistry, no wonder their real life relationship didn't work."
4,it's got its moments,"this comedy, like Click has a funny side to it and then switches to a darker side half way through. the characters in this film can be hated at points, especially Michael Douglas' and Matt Dillon's but there is a lighter side! Owen Wilson is very likeable as Dupree, an unemployed party guy who is in need of love and a good paying job. the cast is fine and one of the strength's in this film! however, I think it gets too serious at points. this is supposed to be a comedy after all. I wouldn't buy it but it is certainly worth renting!"
1,OMG -- Crap,"this is a horriable movie, I actually liked kate and Matt , but I didnt like dupree (owen). Since when is being Obnoxious and uncaring about other people , funny ?... This movie falls flat , its So Cliche it isnt funny . They could have offed owen and just let the movie stand with Kate and matt and the opressive father in law (douglass). And then made a movie out of that . Owen wilson isnt funny in this movie ."
2,Largely Unentertaining.,"Donald Becker and Walter Fagen of Steely Dan are angry about this movie because they claim it is a blatant storyline ripoff of their song ""Cousin Dupree."" I love that song, but have to question if they have ever seen the film. They wouldn't have their hackles up if they did.In very few, short words, my review title says it all. 1 hour and 50 minutes of ""hilarity"" ensued, during which time I laughed all of three times. Crude physical humor abounds with lines uttered by ""zany"" Owen Wilson that are more stupid than funny. Matt Dillon looks like he wants to be somewhere else constantly, and the overrated Kate Hudson is just there looking like the celebrity royalty heir she bases her career upon. Michael Douglas as the vindictive father-in-law is the only palatable aspect of this mess. Boy, am I glad I rented this dud first!"
4,Grecian Blackness,"Rotting Christ is one of the best black metal groups I've come across so far, and this is one of their classics. No metal fan should be without."
5,Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne,This is a much improved game from the first one.I just love the bullet time and how you can redothe scene over and over each time doing it a different way.this game scores a 10/10 in my book.
2,Good Plot,"This book certainly had an interesting plot. However, it didn't seem very organic. I thought that many times situations and characters' actions did not seem to happen naturally. I also felt that the story was very rushed. It jumped from one thing to the next without any real reasoning for why something was happening. All in all, I thought it was a great premise that fell short in the writing."
3,"very nice watch, mine arrived damaged","it's not my first invicta watch, very good watch in general,i rated 3* because this one arrived damaged/not new"
1,This man is a counterfeit christian,"[sarcastically] ""That was a well-plotted piece of non-claptrap that never made me want to retch!""I had the misfortune of sitting through this man's ""sermon"". I've never felt more insulted and belittled in all my life. He spoke for nearly 2 hours and i sat through every bit of it. He spoke for an hour before reading ANYTHING from God's Word. He spent that hour berating the crowd for his past experiences of people having to get up to go to the restroom during his meaningless diatribe. I wouldn't recommend anyone that has a relationship with God to listen to this man speak, or buy any of his books. He is giving false witness and is clearly full of vitriol and anger."
5,The Religion of Science,"For this reader, the important quality of this book is not its critical analysis of the various theories naturalistic evolution. Rather, it is important because it illustrates that believers of a system - whether atheistic or theistic, scientific or metaphysical - tend to embrace that belief with a defiance and close-mindedness that places the actual search for truth as a low priority. I personally have discussed this topic with fundamentalist Christians as well as staunch scientific atheists and find little difference between them, except that they are able quote from different books, and don't dress at all alike. The one thing they seem to have most in common is that they have little understanding of - or tolerance for - the other's point of view.In a complex universe where so little is understood, such arrogance is folly."
1,More of the same intelligent design nonsense...,"Johnson sounds better than most intelligent design creationists, I'll admit, but at heart his arguments are the same that have been trotted out for years. I suggest reading Robert Pennock's new book _Tower of Babel: The Evidence against the New Creationism_ for a devastating critique of Johnson's position."
4,"Excellent, but somewhat hard to understand in places","Although I have not yet read the whole book, I think I have read enough to say that it is excellent. The author has made some very good points, even if he sometimes did them in a more roundabout way than he had to. I'd recomend it to anyone who is interested in this kind of thing."
4,THINK HARD,"At last, great Darwin was sent to a defendant seat.It means we needn't think hard such questions as ""Who am I?"" ""Where do I come from?"" any more since Prof.Philip E.Johnson gave us a hint---God created everyting! But, it's really a pity that there is another question of life?"" It seems that I have still to think hard though H.W.Longfellow sang us ""Life is real! Life is earnest! And the grave is not its goal.""After reading DARWIN ON TRIAL, the fouth questionPerhaps, in my opinion, Earthman is not a Man of ability to answer these questions; just like Robot cannot imagine his creator.Don't worry, dear Earthmen! There is a happening that gives us great pleasure or satisfaction---Think hard!"
5,Exposes Pseudo-Science for What it Really is!,"Very good book debunking the pseudo-science of the Darwinian and neo-darwinian theory of macroevolution. Exposes the philosphophy driving the theory, namely, naturalistic philosophy."
4,granddaughters are still loving this toy,"Spoke with my daughter-in-law. She said this was my oldest granddaughter's favorite birthday gift and they (5 yr old and 3 yr old) are still playing with it everyday. She has noticed not problems with it, but she also stated they have not played outside with it yet, so she can't testify as to how well the little animal stay up. Overall I am glad to have purchased this toy for them and would do it again.May order one for my 6 yr old granddaughter."
1,I wanted to like it!,"Like some of the other reviewers, I was disappointed in this toy. The glued on pieces fell off very quickly and also the animals couldn't stand very well. Great idea and very cute but just too flimsy."
4,Good for the beginner who isn't too demanding,If you are going to make moderately complicated pages I would bypass this book. Even considering that this book geared to the Ultradev beginner it really didn't delve into issues I couldn't find covered in the manual that came with Ultradev usually. However if you are looking for a little coddling and aren't planning to leap into complicated projects this book is a little gem.
3,Who edited this book?,The content of the book is actually not too bad. It covers the interface farely well and the project is a good idea that allows you to cover a great deal of the application. The problem I have with this book is all the typos. The book can confuse someone that is not familiar with the interface. (Not to mention the missing files.)
4,3D Studio Max 3.0 Workshop.,".When I went trough this book in the bookstore, instantly, I had the urge to buy it! The contents were really interesting. But there was one big setback.The very small size of the letters and the book layout, caused me a great eye-stress. After reading a few paragraphs, I was kind of woozy. So, with great pitty from my part, I had to leave it there.I hope that Mr. Duane Loose, writes another book like this one, with equal or even better contents. And with a better layout and more important yet, with a more readble set of letters.For those of U who don't have problems with this, just buy the book! It's worthy! The information is absolutely precious for a better understanding of the basic concepts behind the film creation with MAX.Contents...: 5; Layout...: 2; Comprehension...: 5; Price...: 5: [Evaluation...: 4]."
4,Classic lo-fi,"I will start by saying that I liked this collection. I was leary of the unreleased tracks but found them enjoyable and refreshing for the most part. I had to remember that this was not necessarily a ""Greatest Hits"" collection although the hits all seemed to be on there. I would have liked ""The River Song"" to be there but that's just me. The only objection I have is this misdirected idea that ""classic"" has to sound as bad as it did when I only had an AM radio. Why put mono tracks on a ""definitive collection"" when there were perfectly good stereo versions available, especially for the hits. This is a disappointment that I have experienced with the Beatles, Kinks and Yardbirds. Record labels: please get it that people don't spend good money on nice stereos to hear mono recordings unless that is the only thing available. I would not buy a Robert Johnson album that had been synthetically altered to simulate stereo, but that's another story."
3,A decent intro,"Knowing the hits, but not having any of his albums, this seemed like a natural choice. The price is pretty good for the amount of music you get but be warned! There are many sides to Donovan.I found myself disliking much of the twee chirpiness on display, especially on some of his Jennifer Juniper knock-offs on disc two. There are gems here beyond the familiar standards, and Cosmic Wheels deserves it's own Tarantino movie to go along with it's cool seventies groove. The Dylan comparison is hard to see nowadays, Donovan at his best is pure pop..."
1,Dont even bother,"I enjoyed the first few books in this series enough to see it through to the end. Don't even bother. The later books are so thoroughly dissapointing I wish I had never even started reading this series. You will feel completely let down as the heroes fail again and again and clones die by the millions, spending their lives for absolutely nothing in this unendingly cynical tale."
4,Excelent start to series,"Overall I would compare this to any of the classic sci-fi novels like Gordon R Dickson's series.I found it to be well written and compelling in that Rome came back to an extent with new political twists. While there is the usual sci-fi toys of the gadgets the book does not center on them like some others and rather keep you focused on the implications of a Clone army run by non-clones.Personally I would love to see a back story on how this universe came about.Still, the story stands on its own as a classic ""single trooper"" changes history book."
2,boys sound beached,"With five stars for post beach boys surfin days, we come to the trademark Brian Wilson works of Surf's up and Pet Sounds, adding 4 stars for Holland or Sunflower, and then fall down to ""Love You""; with high hopes still, the album was a beached whale. Even if Brian had returned from his bedside, he was still under doctor's orders, and inspiration is simply not of it. I've kept it for the cover. Skip Love You, which appears to be the boys trying to make Brian's lyrics into music, and continue on to 'good timing' or the Live in Europe album, and the more current Imagination or the new Smile redo if you prefer to find the real education in Beach Boys/Brian Wilson Sonics."
3,Ummmm.... OK.,"This book has a lot of details and is very good. Don't expect this book to tell you lots and lots about the gangsters of the era... it's more of a detailed account of the FBI and how they got organized. Again, lots of details, making it slow reading, but very good material!"
5,Non stop entertainment,"This book is a non stop trill ride. It is filled with detail information on Dillenger, Baby face nelson, Bonnie and Clyde and the entire cast of criminal of that era. I highly recommend this book if you are looking for a true crime book and a taste of American history."
5,misleading subtitles,Just got this DVD...as advertised except there are only English subtitles. Would have liked to get it with Portuguese subtitles to help studying the language.
2,not quite what we expected,"we gave this cd about 10 mins of playing time before deciding that it wasn't going to get any better. we were hoping for mostly bird sounds, which there are, but they're overwhelmed by the unrelenting ""bark"" of a monkey which becomes really absurd after about 1 min. i should have realized that there would be a lot more than just bird calls on this cd."
5,Better than the Original,"I bought Disney Sorry for my son last Christmas. He was 6 at the time. It was a big hit as he is a big Disney fan. I grew up playing the orginal Sorry, and enjoy this version much more. It's the same game, but the Disney Characters make it more fun for some reason. We are still playing with it a year later and it is in good condition."
4,A fun twist to a classic game,"I purchased Disney Sorry when it came out new. We enjoyed it so much that we wore it out. There are cards that are specific to a certain color. If we draw that card for our color we have extra options. An example is the number 3. If it's in my color I get to draw the top three cards and choose the one I want. If it's in another color I just move 3. It makes the game more exciting because while playing we have more hopes of what we will draw. My first purchase was for the Disney characters, my recent purchase was for the cards. When the game comes out the kids come running."
3,Warning: This CD is on the frigid side.,"Just saw Vitiello w/ Scanner at a museum show and was a bit disappointed. I didn't know what to expect having not ever heard either before and it turned out to be just another electronic-sound-design-jack-off-session (with NO beat).The girl working there said that she prefered Vitiello solo and so I took her advice and bought ""The Light of Falling Cars"". She was right- it is more musical than Scanner but still basically background music for working on the computer. Still pretty good for what it is.If you like even a little bit of rythm I strongly suggest anything from Pole."

2,"Good to search materials, but bad to learn from Ganong","I am a medical student. I bought Ganong 18th edition last year. I found it full of new materials but everything it said was not detailed enough to make me understand. If you are a freshman to the subject physiology,I recommand you not to use Ganong as your first book. You must read other books written in detail,like Guyton's Physiology first. A more detailed book would make you easy to understand the beauty of physiology."
5,Best Lennon Yet,"This compilation does a great job of picking up some classics that were missing from 'Lennon Legend.' GOD, WOMAN IS THE NIGGER OF THE WORLD and the scathing GIMME SOME TRUTH are all welcome additions that were left off 'Legend.' The tracks aren't in chronological order but I don't have a problem with this and the songs flow well. 'Imagine' is still a must and 'Plastic Ono Band' is brilliantly shocking and also a must but this is a great overall collection"
5,NEVER DISAPPOINTING,"I HAVE BEEN COLLECTING MUSIC FROM JOHN LENNON MORE THAN HALF MY LIFE. HE IS NEVER DISAPPOINTING. HIS COLLECTION OF MUSIC STILL REMAINS ON TOP AND RELEVENT EVEN TODAY. IN MY OPINION LENNON HAS THE BEST ROCK AND ROLL VOICE. HIS RANGE IS AMAZING. EVEN IF YOU HAVE MOST OF HIS LIBRARY OF MUSIC, HEARING ONE GREAT TUNE AFTER ANOTHER IS STILL MIND BOGGLING. GET THIS CD, GET THIS CD FOR YOUR FRIENDS, OR SOMEONE WHO IS STARTING TO GET INTO THE MUSIC OF THIS GENIUS. ONE COULD ONLY IMAGINE, WHERE HE STANDS ON THE POLITICS OF TODAY."
4,Awesome CD,This is a must have for any John Lennon fan. Almost every song is a great piece of music. I can listen to both discs all the way through... Great Music!
4,Niiiiiiiiiiiiiice!!!,"This is an awesome album. And worth picking up! You can hear a lot of different influences in the music, but no so that it sounds contrived. It's a little rough around the edges, but I find that rather appealing. I look forward to their next album,which I believe should be out later in 2002."
3,A Disappointment,"""So Tough"" was a big disappointment when it was released in 1972, and it's really quite to understand having re-heard to album a couple of times . Brian Wilson's participation in the release was minimal, and although the two new members Ricky Fataar and Blondie Chaplin were talented musicians and competent songwriters, they were unable to lift the album above a mediocre level.The classic Beach Boys sound is prevalent on ""Marcella,"" which is one of Brian Wilson's contributions. The song is terrifically sung by Carl Wilson in his best ""Darling"" style.The ballad ""All this is That"" written by Carl Wilson, Al Jardine and Mike Love is also quite nice.Dennis Wilson has been praised for his contributions to the album, and although ""Cuddle Up"" without discussion is a fine composition, neither the song or the arrangement really suit ""Beach Boys"".Only eight songs and a relatively short playing time.Overall one of the group's weakest 1970s albums."
4,summer party tunes on Mystery Men record,"They added the Freak Power song, ""No Way,"" which is Fatboy Slim's other band in Britain and the track kicks ass - ""Throw your hands in the air, throw your hands in the air!"" The Dub Pistols remix is another great electronica track. Kel Mitchell from Nickelodeon makes his debut with a great hip hop anthem, ""Who Are Those Mystery Men."" Check it out, you'll be pleasantly surprised. Can't wait to see the movie."
3,Too much chill and not enough vanilla,"Found this to not taste much like vanilla, but had a way-to-overwhelming peppermint taste. Helps your breath, but really hard to like because it's just too strong."
4,Works great!,"I was very pleased with this product. I had several pet accident stains on my rug that nothing else could get out. This got rid of them entirely. I did have to go over the worst one twice, but the unit is very light and compact and easy to use. It's fairly easy to clean out afterward as well. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that it doesn't hold much solution. One or two small stains and you find yourself having to refill the tank. Still, for the price, I was very pleased with it."
1,No suction!!!,"I put this item back in the box to return it just 5 minutes after i took it out. The chamber where you put the cleaning liquid leaked, and when i went to use it on my couch (since it says it's appropriate for upholstery) it sprayed and then never sucked up the liquid so my couch basically just got soaked with cleaning liquid and no dirt was ever suctioned by the cleaner. It worked a little better on a section of carpet but over all this product did not deliver what it said. I would advise to spend a little more money and get a better product."
3,A simple solution,"I was underwhelmed by this product. I had researched other Bissell models, and this had the best rating on removing stains, mechanical function, and clean up after use. When I got it, I realized that its essentially a scrub brush and a solution sprayer. Very low tech. It sucks up water, but I can get the same result with a towel. So its an expensive and bulky solution that doesn't do enough."
3,not impressed,I think this would be good for small spots on a low pile carpet. It did not work very well on higher pile carpet. I guess it may be fine for in between professional cleanings
2,almost not worth the $50,got this cause it was cheap and had good reviews...needed it for cat piss in the couch.poor suction and even worse battery life...can barely do anything with it.the small amount of sucked up liquid vs. the amount sprayed down in scary.you are basically spraying solution on the surface and letting it air dry...waste of time/money/effort.
5,highly recommend,I would highly recommend this item. Great little cleaner for those small spots. I use it for pet stains and love it! Quick and easy to use and takes up little room.
3,Bissell Spotlifter,"The Spotlifter works OK, but I couldn't rate it much higher. It needs to have a rotating brush to really get into the carpet fibers. Without a rotating brush the unit is really no better than using a spray cleaner and a hand brush."
3,just ok,"I find this product is kind of difficult to take apart to clean and also leaks a little. I bought it to clean pet spills..it works ok but you need to scrub back and forth with some force (for cat vomit). With the effort it takes I really havent used it much, im back to just using a rag and some cleaner."
2,Just stopped working,"I bought this item in September and before the end of October it had stopped working. Just won't come on even when plugged in. It worked great on puppy ""spills"" and old dog accidents when it was functioning! I'm so frustrated!"
2,Would not repurchase,"Lasts 7 min per use to charge for hours. Does not work off outlet power. Did clean areas,, but 7 min use is very frustrating!!"
5,Perfect for small pet spots!,"I got this mostly because I have a long-haired cat, and she gets hairballs no matter what. There are ""accidents"" that happen, and she leaves a little spot behind, yet even if I'm not around to find it right away, this gadget takes care of it! I love the portability of it, the ease of filling/emptying both the solution and waste bottles, etc.You can just leave the carpet cleaner plugged in - with the solution still in there - or keep it in your closet. That way, you can grab it and go. Plus, you have the option of spraying more solution on there with the click of a button for those tough spots. It's quick, light, easy to handle.Really, this was an incredible find at the price we paid. Fabulous!"
1,can't for the life of me open the dirty water container!!!,"I am so frustrated! I got one of these, and could not open the front compartment. i called, and they sent me another one, and I still cannot open this compartment! I am not weak, nor do I have tiny fingers, the hinge is just so strong, there is no way to get a good grip on the thing. If you grip the handle, it squirts all over, and still not enough pressure or something to open the darn thing!now i have two i can't use.am going to explore other brands..."
1,Bad quality,"This spot cleaner literally broke after I used it for several times. The body can not hold the dirty water container in its place because of possibly deformations. It is true that it is difficult to clean the dirty water container and it is a bit difficult to re-install it onto the body. And the worst part is, it leaks -- probably because the rubber seals become fatigue and do not work well anymore."
3,"5*s for suction, 1* for design","This things works great for picking up spills. I can't provide any feedback for how it works on old stains as I haven't used it for that.But if you get to a spill quickly, it's like it never happened. The vacuum has a small entry point which creates a ton of suction, which is great! I bought this because Santa brought my son a puppy. Enough said, right?The issue I have with this unit is the design. It is way too difficult to take off the container to empty and it gets messy when you do. This is no fun, especially if the reservoir is full of puppy urine.On the opposite end of the spectrum, the container which holds the cleaning solution doesn't fit tightly enough and also seems to 'leak' whenever you take it off.I am going to have to figure out how to deal with the design issues as the suction makes it worth it for me. But with a few minor design changes, this model could have been a 5*, especially given the price."
1,Minimal Charge,"We didn't read the information closely enough on the product description until we got it home. The charge last for less than 15 minutes and then requires 12 hours to charge it up again. Unless you have one very small stain, this product is useless or it would seem that way since it couldn't hold its charge long enough for us to see if it works or not. There are better, longer lasting, products on the market. This is not a good choice for almost any stain removal/cleaning need. Buyer Beware!!!"
1,Poor Design. Dont waste your money,Very poor design.The back tank where the solution and water goes in just sits there and dosent lock into place.Should of read all the reviews before purchasing. From now on ill buy all my merchandise locally and see what im buying.
1,Complete bust,"The tanks for the clean water and cleaning solution wouldn't stay connected. I couldn't get it to stay, so when I turned the carpet cleaner on it just didn't function at all the way it should. I've upgraded to theBISSELL Spotbot Pet Handsfree Spot and Stain Cleaner with Deep Reach Technology, 33N8Aand couldn't be happier."
4,Beltronics V940,"This is the lower priced Beltronics radar detector so it does not have a lot of bells and whistles. It does however, have the same sensing specs as the higher priced ones. It has better range than my Cobra but I would have hoped for a little better selectivity on KA band false alarms. It is a very good product and I would recommend it. It is one of the better values on the market"
3,Worked for just under 1 year - then stopped detecting,"Was happy with detector until a recent vacation road trip; the detector stopped detecting. It gave the impression of full operation, proper startup signals and such. However, after a 1200 miles, it failed to detect anything.In process of returning for warranty repair. Shipping at my expense. Great when it worked, Poor reliability."
3,Its alright for the price,"It's a little on the heavy side, it only recognizes a couple speed enforcement cameras, spotted a officer w/ a radar gun before the detector went off...not very good & detecting radar guns."
1,Disappointed,"The Vector 940 is very distracting to me when driving. It is constantly going off (even while in ""City Mode""). I made a change to the settings as advised by customer service, but it was not much help. Also, a friend of mine has had his radar detector for years and loves it (not sure of the brand). His detector turns on and off when he turns his ignition on and off. Not so with the Vector 940. It has to be turned on and off separately from the ignition. This is very inconvenient and puts wear on the power button. I checked with customer service and was told there was no fix for this. I should have checked this item out better before purchasing. I let the good customer ratings influence me too much."
4,Well worth the cost,I have onwned several detectors over the years but refused to pay what I considered an arm and a leg . This model has proved to be worth the cost. On highway it would pick up radar at a much greater distance. Fewer false alarms. and the ability to ID the diffirent bands are very helpfull. The only down side is it's sieze and bulk.
4,Beltronics V940,"This is a very good radar detector, especially for the price. It's rugged, been dropped once, unfortunately, but did not affect it. Only problem I've got with it, is, seems to be too susceptable to burglar alarms,electric doors etc.(x and k band alarms in highway mode). I have same model,but older one, and it doesn't seem to be that sensitive to burglar alarms, electric doors, etc. I've had that one for quite some time too. Good longevity.If it goes off in Ka, or laser, better SLOW down. My area is Ka, or laser.Overall very good, would recomend it for the driver looking for protection, on a budget."
4,Great value radar detector,"This detector replaces an 8 yr old Bel 890 that was starting to have problems with its power cord, causing it to frequently reset. The V940 and others in the Bel Vector line get consistent top value ratings; and we were already very pleased with our previous Bel, so this replacement was pretty easy to choose.As you'd expect, this V940 performs even better than our very old Bel 890, giving earlier warnings in areas we already knew to have radar (or earlier falsings to known auto-opening doors).The power cord has been updated to a more robust coiled cable and a telephone plug vs the old cable. The windshield suction mount has been simplified as well.If you need a good, basic detector that's top in Ka and K band performance in its price range (<$200), this is it."
2,Was great for me until,Yes it is a bit heavy to move - but I moved it infrequently. Worked great until the wiring came loose and got caught in the folding mechism cut through wire and circutry will cost more than its value to fix.
3,Contradictionary book for beginners,"First of all, this book is nice to read to get a general picture of the process of making computer games. But, as others have already mentioned, it is very superficial and most of the content is just common sense. Not much here for anyone not completely new to the business.But the biggest problem is that while Bob talks about game theory and business in a very shallow way (great for beginners), he support his theories with examples from big game companies (where nobody is a beginner anyway)."
1,someone turned a bunch of squirrel monkeys loose,"This is not the squarepusher I remembered.No cool techno beats, no sweet bass n drums. Just crap.This is a bunch of monkeys beating on instruments with the record light on.If I wanted chaotic 70's fuzion jazz, I would go buy it.This just sucks.rhythm? none.just a bunch of unrelated sounds that sound bad together."
4,It's packed with great songs!,"I own all three volumes of the Serenade compilations, and this latest installment did not let me down. It's got everything you want from a cd. love songs, sad songs, i wanna get freaky with you songs! (Get all three!!! They're GGGRRRREEEEAAAAAAAAATTT!!)"
3,ONLY FOR DIE HARD JOHN MAYALL FANS,"This CD originally issued on LP has been around for a number of years with different covers/same songs by various labels around the globe. It was originally called ROADSHOW BLUES or something like that. It never got proper promo upon it's LP release in 1981. It was issued on a tiny label. The CD is 9 tracks. About half studio & half live. The best track on this CD is ""Baby What You Want Me To Do"". The rest find Mayall & Co. in limbo. Hey! I love Mayall and have almost everything he ever released, but this is not up to par with his best work."
1,Be very careful,"The sending unit worked fine....for just about four hours before the cheesy retainer on the float arm failed. Now, the float is drifing around somewhere inside of our tank, and the gas gauge reads ""empty."" We are faced with having to uninstall and reinstall just because of a cheap retainer clip. If you buy this product, be sure to permanently secure the float to the float arm."
5,"It Wasn't Easy Bein' Rodney, But It Made For A Great Book","It's Not Easy Bein' Me: A Lifetime of No Respect but Plenty of Sex and Drugs is an honest, well-written, humorous book about one of the great comedians of all time. I thoroughly enjoyed reading about Rodney Dangerfield's life."
5,A collection of the best stories and jokes from Rodney,I saw one of Rodney's stand-ups on Johnny Carson's show and got interested in getting to know more about this magnificent comedian. I bought this book and couldn't stop reading it. It's very entertaining and is filled with Rodney's fantastic one- liners. Highly recommended!
4,A soothing any time of day companion,"I have listened to Mr Saffer's works for a couple of years now. His latest, Seascapes, is a jewell in the sand. I use it in my computer while I read the news and it helps me cope with this world going mad. It is also very relaxing during my reading times in the evening. The music sounds like Debussy coming back fully relaxed from a Caribbean vacation and with a new sense of percussion rhythm. It is a must in anyone's collection. Trust this is not the last I will hear from Mr. Saffer as his talent is on a crescent wave and will produce many good things in the future."
1,Horrible product,"We bought this monitor and it is absolutely lousy. When we use it with the receivers plugged in instead of battery use, they make this awful loud humn noise that gives you a headache and makes you feel like your sitting under a high tension wire. We know it's not just our house causing it - because friends that have the same monitor complained about the same noise with theirs that they bought around the same time as us. When we use it with battery power alone, the life of the battery wears out in just like 5 nights of using it - and this is just using it when the baby goes to bed until we go to bed. I find it totally unacceptable and will be looking for a different monitor."
3,Stock up on batteries now!,"This monitor set worked great for us, even in a 2-story home. It doesn't pick up once you step outside if the baby is upstairs, but I didn't really expect it to. The problem is that it goes through 9volt batteries like crazy! I used it at night and for one nap over a one week span and the batteries went dead in one receiver. I started using the other receiver until I could get more batteries and it died after two nights! My husband said it's because I left it on all night, but isn't that what it's for???"
2,Too Much Feedback!!!,"I bought this monitor after reading many good reviews, and was not at all satisfied. With batteries the thing worked great, but it only lasts about seven hours. When you plug it in, it has feedback. If you were to use this dureing the day the buzzing might not be so bad, but at night the feedback kept me up more than my 2 week year old!"
3,Adequate for the price,"This monitor had quite a bit of static, but worked well if we placed it someplace with the sound turned down but we could see the lights on it - it is very sensitive. It is too noisy to use while trying to sleep (unless you are a fairly heavy sleeper or need a white noise machine!)."
4,Problem with battery cover,"Overall, we're happy with this monitor - the reception is very clear and we can hear our daughter's slighest sounds. But we did have trouble unscrewing the battery cover - the screw is so fragile and it gets easily stripped. I could not even remove the cover at all. We returned the first monitor and had the same problem with the replacement - we decided to leave the screw out and just snap in the battery cover. My advice - keep the box/packaging and receipt until you're sure all parts of the monitor work, in case you need to return/exchange it."
2,horse racing game,The wooden horse race game is a lot of fun but when mine came it was warped. The wood is very thin and light. It could be made better for the price.
3,Simple fix for higher score....,"This game came with NO INSTRUCTIONS OR 'HOW TO PLAY RULES'......This made playing a little hard and we had a poker party planned, but had to cancel since we had no instructions.. If this can be corrected it would help all of those who purchase it from Amazon.Com..The rest of my order was great, and I will be ordering movies from you again.. no games or anything other then movies.Hope this note helps your business successes. Donna"
3,Not Truthful Regarding Contents,"The dolls are cuddly and soft and I am sure my 2 year old granddaughter will love them but, THEY DO NOT COME WITH THE BOTTLES OR THE HATS OR THE BRACELET FOR THE OWNER. Misleading advertising! They should update the website to reflect the change.Little Mommy Girl/Girl Twin - Pink and Green"
1,How can I rate something,"when I refuse to buy it? And the reason I refuse to buy it is because Amazon doesn't list any of the tracks on the CD. For all I know I have all the tracks on it, or who knows? The description tells me nothing at all about the product."
4,a herman's hermits fan,I have this herman's hermits collection on cassette.I bought it at a record store a few years ago i think. The songs on this herman's hermits collection are not the original recordings but are the original artists . I would say that i like this album even though there not the original songs. Because it's still music i would recomend you buy this album even though there not the original songs. Original hits are better but this album is good too.
2,More Funny Than Actually Good,"The Beta Band is THE example of alternative music. Simply impossible to categorize.It is very artistic indeed. However in general, it is more funny to listen to rather than actually great music.There are even a few 8 minute tracks like the pretty good 'It's Not Too Beautiful' or 'The Hard One' which has lyrics from 'Total Eclipse Of The Heart'. The melodically joyful 'Round The Bend' is quite good too, as is the near-acapella 'The Cow's Wrong', and the rap 'Dance-O'er-The-Border' is among the less unusual songs on this highly original album.The stars are mainly for originality."
2,"Worked great at first, but quality is poor","Purchased 3 for an under counter light in the garage. Worked great for one month. Construction was fine, function was fine. Interconnet wire a nice feature. Met all expectations. However, after several uses one of the three lights stopped working. Not sure of the root problem. Poor quality if the life expectancy is less the two months."
4,a good solid reference photographically,"I've had this book for several years now and have found it to be very useful in identifying some cacti by their appearance alone, as the book is really a photo album with little text. It can also be used to choose species of cacti that you might want to own because it gives you some idea of their appearance 'pre-buying'. The authors are brothers who have worked well together and that in itself is kinda neat! I can recommend it to beginners and even some intermediate aficionados of cacti."
2,Better off without it,"We went to the Olympics and ended up ditching this guide because the information was either incorrect or woefully incomplete to use without supplemental information (i.e., transportation). But the Olympics were fabulous and Torino is a must see place!"
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Funny, Ennis style ciggie drooping out of mouth spoof. It was unlikely an American writer would come up with this. A prostitute, who is a single mother, with all those problems as well, gains super powers. She ends up on a super team that is very image and pr conscious. A reasonable amount of hilarity ensues. With miniskirts."
1,no title,"Dumb, dumb book. All about terrorists and plane bombings. Deverell's first novel and it shows. Writing is atrocious, plot far too intricate. Who could plot 12 bombings at the same time?"
5,The understanding of why any business or organization will prevail.,"Absolutely Druckers best! This is one of three Books that are fundamentally important for existing in business. This is the understanding necessary for helping leaders,management and future leaders make decisions. This should be a text book for anyone starting a business,all business schools,all business decision makers,or anyone that wants(or has)to make decisions in any enterprise. You will BE better for reading this book. Take your time, because it is all here."
3,Not correctly so -- the oldest civilization.,"Anyone who is familiar with Peruvian prehistory knows the Caral/Supe urban centers and complex predates the Olmecs by a millennia. The earliest urban centers and civilizations in all of the Americas are found in Peru. Presently, a site known as Bandurria, confirmed by carbon14 dating is 5,000 years old."
1,not recommended,"The book is1st: absolutely poor in the photographs and hand made drawings2nd: all themes about controverse objects and artifacts are omitted with high accuracy3rd: the situation he described is true for Mexico of the 1940ies, not of today (treasure hunters damage most of the areas - he should visit it today, please!and learn about mexican law concerning this subject)4th: he is not able to discuss the problem that on olmec reliefs clearly negroid people and semitic people are portrayed-indians in this regions looks not like the the portraits of olmec heads5th: he forgot the archaeological artifacts of Monte albanConclusion: If this is an high graduated professor of an university, something of the knowledge and thinking of this people most me out of time. Or, what is the reason for a professor to speak about were-Jaguars-is he consuming were-wolf-films?PS: I know all olmec places very well and think, i know what I' m speaking about!"
5,Highly recommended,"Surprisingly enough, academician and scholar Richard Diehl's The Olmecs: America's First Civilization is the first complete survey and overview analysis of the peoples who created the first complex culture in Mesoamerica, adding new information from recent archaeological findings to consider Olmec life, culture and art. Diehl's background as a professor of anthropology at the University of Alabama and his personal experience conducting archaeological investigations in Mexico lend appreciable substance and insight to his authoritative, ""reader friendly"" coverage, which is packed with illustrative black and white photos of Olmec relics. Highly recommended!"
4,AN ANTHOLOGY,"This cd is only for die hard fans of NECROPHAGIA. First of all, the songs on this are all old demos for the late 80s and early 90s so they sound very raw and primitive (unlike their newer releases). There are no lyrics included in this digipak.As I said, this is Killjoy and his freaks when they were only teenagers so don t expect the recording of the year.However, this is a piece of horror metal history so if you are a hardcore freak like myself, get this cd or get decapitated!"
2,Watch out for factual errors,"I found this book to be a fast read and an informative history of the Interstate system, but I was disappointed by some of the factual errors in the book. For example, on the same page Lewis writes that Interstate 15 and California State Route 1 intersect in Victorville and that I-10 and I-15 meet in Mira Loma, CA. Neither are true and it's disappointing that someone writing a book on the highway system (or his editor) didn't do the minimal fact checking involved (with a map!). If such basic errors were allowed to slip by, I wonder what other ""facts"" in the book are questionable."
1,GI Style My Butt,"I am very unhappy with this. I ordered in the thought of it was Military Style. It is much smaller than military style. It is not 24X36. More like 18X 24. I am very unhappy and angry with it. I needed a good big Military Duffle bag. In my opinion, do not purchase. Poor Quality and Is no where near (GI)military style."
2,Wrong Coloring,"The watch is nice, it may be a little small for my boyfriend's preference but I ended up returning the item because the color was so different from what was actually featured online. I order gunship expecting a dull gray or black tint watch but the watch that arrived was blue. It wasn't quite navy blue either, a little lighter then navy. I returned the watch today."
4,"I broke mine too, but...","...I'm still recommending it. Actually, I'm on my fourth and I ordered three more. I mean, they're ridiculously cheap. This is actually the fourth variety of case I have used; and not only is it the cheapest price-wise, it is also my favorite. I am marking it down one star because of the propensity for the belt clip to detatch from the holster itself. I admit that on all occasions that mine broke they were fairly rough circumstances. During average day-to-day use they're great and are not likely to just come undone. The unit itself holds the blackberry firmly and snugly, yet it is still easy to remove the phone quickly with one hand. Furthermore, it is compact and elegant, unlike many of its bulky competitors. I have given them away to several friends, and I've taken notice that they've all replaced their fancy-man leather cases with these. Function over fashion, 'nuff said."
3,cheap..& functional,"bought the product to put my blackberry on the visor in my car while i'm driving, stays on most of the time. The secure tab on top is stiff, but can easily be broken, I have broken 2. Not really quality, but for twenty at the AT&t store for the same thing, this is a bargain, I can actually buy at least half dozen (shiiping/handling included) of these, compared to one at the retail stores"
2,Typo's galore.,This 110 year old book contains a good story. Unfortunately the print on demand technology used optical character readers (OCR's) to render the text. It was full of misspellings and some paragraphs were gibberish. Made it hard to read and incomplete.
1,Advice fromthose who made 9% from 1981 to 1993?,"While mutual-fund managers (who manage other people's money) are forced to disclose their actual returns with periodic audits from established accounting firms, ""investment advisors"" are free to make up numbers to sell their advice. The implicit message behind every investment book (Buffett, Lynch, et al) is the unspoken promise: ""If you think about investment as I do, you, too can earn my spectacular returns.""Buffett and Lynch earned the right to toot their own horn -- having beaten the general index over decades. The Beardstown Ladies' dirty little secret is that they ""accidently"" included their monthly dues into their total returns of their fund. If a mutual fund manager did this with his 12b-1s he'd be in jail. Skip the book and go for Peter Lynch."
5,great blend,"bought this in Canada along with Tao Jones. This CD is terrific-- Roni Size remixes, Fatboy Slim, it is truly wirth every last cent. I would buy it again just to show how much I like it!"
1,Not received,Have not received items waited a month...keep moving the delivery date further and furter away. would not buy again.
5,Great Birthday Present,"This was a birthday present to my very talented 28 year old son who isn't sure what he wants to be when he grows up but is really quite ""remarkable."" He said the book ""hit the mark."""
4,Lots of fun,"All of Steele's books are just plain fun and this is no exception. Bizzare of course, but fun. I like his tributes to the greats and his nostaligic treatment of current scifi, ""the good old days of Captain Kirk."" The Elvis Cult is a riot."
2,Ultimately disappointing,"Steele does a wonderful job with worldbuilding, with the right amount of hard SF details of the logistics, economics, and demographics of Clarke County. His prose is, as ever, always tight and frequently witty. However, the literary tools he uses--in particular, two more or less omniscient characters--are at best annoying and at worst completely disrupt the novel. (Having deus ex machina lampshaded does not magically make its use OK!)"
3,Cute. Child-like. Moralistic. Animated.,"This is a children's story about heart and determination overcoming obstacles. Sort of a Vince-Lombardi-meets-cute-zebra story. There is a relationship sub-plot between Sandy, a lovely white mare, and Stripes.It is rather interesting how the animal dialogue is so much more interesting and engaging than the human dialogue.The baby zebra is very cute."
5,Lovely movie,"My daughter absolutely loved it. She is six and like me has a passion for horses and horseback riding. One could say that it is full of cliches -the mean rich horse track owner, the somber father, the arrogant race horses, happy ending, etc... but this is a movie for kids, it is cute and I truly enjoyed hearing my daughter laugh and enjoy every moment of it."
4,You'll want to see this film before showing it to very young.,It was recommended to me by family members. I think it is a very good film but I think it is best for children over 5 or 6 who might understand implicitly the death of a parent.
3,Cute...,I watched this movie with two girls aged 5 & 9 and my 7 year old son. We thought the movie was cute and it gave us quite a few laughs but it didn't hold their attention through many parts. Normally they'll sit still and keep quite throughout a movie but for some reason they kept getting bored and restless. Overall we did like the movie but I don't see any of us asking to watch it again. If the movie is on TV I think it would be cute to watch but I wouldn't recommend running out and buying it.
1,Sucked,"This movie (I this is my trademark when I highly disapprove of what the movies come out with) sucked to high heaven.I have been a longtime fan of the horse racing world. It is a horrible thing to stick this tape in the player and call it a ""Horse race"".The movie tryed to get the sympathy vote. Like they needed to win or the zebra was going to get put down if he doesn't and the prom princess daughter was going to get killed if she didn't win.There's a horrible lesson for kids to see in this film: Winning is the Key to Happiness. To save your child's brain, WINNING ISN'T EVERYTHING!!! You will thank me later.The thing thinks that a zebra winning a fixed race can warm family's hearts over. I'm flattered, for my heart is cold ice.This weekend, I'm going to my grandma's. To see REAL horses run a REAL race in the Jockey Club Gold Cup. I advise you do the same."
2,"seriously, ONLY for compulsive, masochistic fans of tATu","The remixes on this CD are utterly amateur. I have been to small, low-key parties where the DJ had more remixing talent than the makers of this album. And I am not just saying this because I have cramped taste; I listen to a wide variety of electronic/vocal music, some of it quite experimental, and I have no trouble recognizing musical creativity for what it is. This album is not strange or innovative, it just sucks.The included ""special feature"" remix video looks like something I could have made at home myself using Adobe Premiere. Yuck.I like the original songs, but this CD is a waste of your money and time, unless you are one to insist on owning every single product released by tATu."
3,All right for a textbook,"The book isn't really all that interesting. Some of the good aspects are that the print is big, and it is easy reading. You can knock a chapter or two out of the way in an hour easily."
1,"Suite Life of Zack & Cody, The: Hotel Hangout - Chapter Book #1 (Suite Life of Zack and Cody)",I have not received this product yet. I bought it on 12/18/06 andhave not received any correspondence.
4,Interesting,"I agree with the previous posters that Jamaican's due take this book as fact. I took a tour of the house in November 2004 and purchased this book from the giftshop of Rosehall.The tour guides tell this same story (albeit shortened) during the tour of the house. It is accepted as fact. It is the only book that I have found that deals with this interesting house and its inhabitants. I wish that the book included a map of some kind that laid out the buildings on the property, as most of the original builings have either been demolished or decayed."
5,May change your mind about missionaries!,"This man is extraordinary! While we desire wealth, security, good health, and so much more, Vic Olsen's autobiography touches my heart as I see the tremendous passion and commitment of a Christian missionary to help the people of Bangladesh while ignoring the superficial desires of our society. His life trumps the stereotype delusional missionary of the same era portrayed in The Poisonwood Bible by Barbara Kingsolver. You may reject his perspective that Jesus Christ is the Messiah (although he provides a logical defense), but think again what this man did because he committed his life to Jesus Christ. Is not this world better off because of this man's decision? Now, what am I going to do?"
2,Dream street... :(,"Well, i must say that the boys, of course, do have talent, and do have great voices, especially since they were only kids when they recorded this album.So, we can't blame the guys!But: The albums sucks!Because: It'spure bubblegumpopBecause: Only girls between the age of 11-15 will like this cdBecause: The songs aren't written by the boys themselvesBecause: These eleven years olds are singing about things theyshould not have thought about on such a young age!Well, that's it..."
1,Just another boy band,This is just another boy band and they're not original or anything. They are just carbon copies of the whole boy band sugar coated pop thing. But unlike the others (NSYNC) they really have no future and they'll hopefully be gone soon.
1,?,This is a joke right? Music must really be dead if this is the kind of act that record companies are signing.
1,THIS MUSIC IS BAD!,"This CD is really, really, really, bad! That's basically all I have to say! They think they are sooo cool because they think they are like *N SYNC, 98 degrees, or the Backstreet Boys. Trust me...they totally aren't like any of them at all. All of their songs sound like the one before. You can't make a CD with the same exact music and just different words. That is totally cheating the person who spent their money on the CD. I really don't get ""It Happens Every Time."" By the way Dream Street what in the world happens ""Every Time?"" Also isn't Dream Street supposed to be the name of a street NOT a bunch of boys who sing off-tune. You know! Everyone out there...SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! BUY SOMETHING ELSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,You've got to be kidding me!,"Just what we need! Another talentless group of dumb [...] who really suck! The only girls that actually like this are 9-13 year old girls who dot their i's with hearts and only like the group because they're cute!! This teen pop thing has without a doubt worn out its welcome and has got to go and go fast! We need a new Nirvana! As for the fans all I have to say is GROW UP, QUIT SHOPPING AT GAP KIDS and START LISTENING TO REAL MUSIC! And you're supposed to like the music for the music itself not because the members are good looking!"
5,GREAT!,This cd was great. Even my mom agrees. My sister even agrees and she's hates everything I like. They have nice voices and have really nice songs. You won't regret buying it. I assure you that...Dream Street is really good. They deserve good ratings.
3,"Creative, but very limited.","Although the tables are very creative, and the graphics are very good, it can be very limited, and sometimes difficult at some points.The main table (Speedway) is basically the same thing for every track, the only thing that changes is the track logos on the position tower change to the track that you're playing, or ""racing"", on.I was always a pinball fanatic since I was young, and I was not too pleased with it.The movements are basically the same thing every time. There isn't much variety at all.And I also think that 3-D Ultra Nascar Pinball is sometimes too difficult, and can really get on your nerves and can also be very annoying.3-D Ultra Nascar Pinball has creative tables and very good graphics, but the gameplay is below average. In the end, I just wouldn't buy it. It just isn't worth it what it comes with."
4,good tool,"This grinder works fine, use in automotive field with dremel grinder bits. May be a little better is had more RPM but its ok."
2,overrated butt-kissing,"This book includes too much butt-kissing and paternalism. Sure, Mockbee and his students are helping these people, but they seem a bit too proud of themselves. I wish there was more technical information about the designs, materials, and techniques."
2,Boring 50 Hour Movie,"I believe calling this a ""game"" is a misnomer as there is very little gameplay to speak of. What gameplay is there consists of the following: walk around, buy equipment, fight repitive tedious menu-based battles that have little to no strategy behind them, and finally watch cut scenes. I suppose you could call it a partially interactive movie but thats about it.Despite the somewhat interesting story and well designed characters I still can't find a reason to play this. But if I want intersting stories and characters sans interactivity I'd much rather watch a movie.Some people enjoy ""games"" like Final Fantasy but I certainly don't. If you want a role playing game that actually involves *gasp* role playing and gameplay I highly recommend Fallout 1/2 and Planescape: Torment. Both games allow you to create your own solutions to problems based upon your playing style, possess interesting characters and stories, and have fun challenging strategic combat."
5,Final Fantasy X is awesome!,"Well folks, lets face it. Final Fantasy X is probably THE best role-playing game out there. For those of you who don't like this game, its probably because you didn't like the beginning so you got rid of it. I thought the same thing at first, but if you play it for a while, you'll definitely learn to like it. You just have to learn how to play and improve your characters for it to be fun. Anyway, I'm glad I bought Final Fantasy X because it is keeping me from wasting my money on other games because it is so long. So, buy this game and you can't go wrong, trust me."
5,"Ya ya! Super Game, Ya!","Okay, first off, I am Japanese, so no jokes, okay? Well this game kicks Sailor Moon behind! I mean this is the KING boys and girls. The graphics are superb, not only in the cutscenes, but also in the normal game playing. The storyline, though confusing at first, is excellent! Ya! Okay to the second point I really really want to tell you that this game has more than 70 hours of gameplay. I played this game for 136 and 25 minutes (sorry, no seconds included!). Being a game reviewer, I am completely for this game! Anyways buy this game Now! It is well worth it!!! Ya ya super game ya!"
5,game,It took a little getting used to the fighting format because I was used to normal actual fighting like in kingdom hearts but once I got the hang of it because i was three characters at once it became fun. The plot is really good and weird to. and after zoning out on it so much and becoming a brainless zombie while playing it I kept thinking praise be to yevon because they say it all the freaking time.
3,Garbage,"Don't bother with this piece of garbage. It's an embarressment to the FF series. The characters are pitiful, the story is even worse and the enimies are character specific. Don't waste your money."
5,DROOL,"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....oh, sorry. This is the best RPG game I've ever played! Great storyline, great graphics, and I love the sphere grid. No matter who plays it, you won't be able to pt it down without a fight (a VERY long fight). It doesn't have the best in game graphics (DUH, GT3), but it has the best video graphics ever."
5,ADDICTING!!,"I had heard that this game was good. It is that and more. To me, the story line took me into another world.I highly recommend Final Fantasy X!!!"
5,Best one yet!,"Ok this game is abit old - even the reviews are old - but i seen it here and wanted to post my opinion. This game - came with my inital order of my PS2 - spent almost half-a-grand on stuff for my PS2 (the system was 300dollars then, games were bout 55, memory was bout 50 too) and i initially bought this game to say i had it. And i played it and became another statistic on the Final Fantasy Fans List. I loved this game i was absorbed by it in no time. Great graphics, and the story line is excellent. If your thinking about buyin this game, by all means do it. its great. Has Challenge - good plot, good characters/voices, good graphics. excellent game."
1,BORING,"What a waste of time. I absolutely hated how the game switches to a movie format ALL THE TIME with me having nothing to do but sit there and watch and if i want to watch a movie i will rent one. I finally just thought ""I hate this""."
5,My First FF title,"Having not completed this game, I can tell you what I've seen so far. The game play is great and is easy to figure out. The graphics are out of this world, and the cut scene movies are really good. I've set this title aside for a while, because it will consume you like only a game like this can. If you have about 2 months with nothing else to do but game, then pick this title up and give it a try. Otherwise, be prepared to stay up late and forget about sleep."
1,After a second look..,"FFX isn't all it's cracked up to be. After reading the reviews for this game, I literally got sick because of the words ""demo, voice acting, graphics"" and so on. Graphics don't make the game, however it appears a lot of people think this. If you really enjoy FFX play FF8. It's almost the same game."
2,BORING AS HELL,"This game is a major drag. Actually, maybe I shouldn't call it a game but a movie (CARTOON), because you really don't get to play. For the most part you just get to watch and listen to the endless boring dialogue between the uninteresting characters. The only purpse you serve is to direct the characters to the red arrows, so you can watch a little movie/video clip. The fighting scenes aren't much better, you get to choose a target and mode of attack, than as usual you get to watch.The graphics are really good, but if I wanted a video/movie or whatever you want to call it than I'd watch a movie, and I would choose one with a better story."
2,Another Failure,"I've played every Final Fantasy and beat almost all of them (couldn't bring myself to finish IX), and this is the second worst one ever, next to IX. The Final Fantasy games all went downhill after VI, it was the best by far, but VII was still good. Unfortunately someone decided that everything about all final fantasy games needed a complete overhaul, which worked good in some games like 7 where the materia system was innovative at least. Eight they had better looking characters and a darker plot. Then they decided that since everyone hated it they would try to ""remake"" 3. It didn't work and now their games are ..."
1,BEST GAME EVER,"FFX Is easyily the best game in the world! With updatid graphics from all prequels, a billion mini-games, online support, best graphics maybe not virtul reallity stuff but close and it is very good! Square is the best"
1,This is a movie not a game!!!,"I realize that a lot of people love this game but frankly it is just not my cup of tea. Most of the time you do nothing but watch a movie. It has to be the longest movie ever. Even when you do get to play all you do is walk from point A to B. It is just plain boring and really slow. I admit it could get better at the end. I haven't invested the 300 hours that my brother has, but there are a lot better games out there where you get to play right from the beginning instead of a hundred hours into it."
2,would not recommend it to all gamer,"I am a fan of RPG game. When I started to play, the demo was awesome. But, gameplay was somewhat confusing and difficult to understand without manual. (blockbuster does not provide manual) Anyways, I wish the user interface would have been easy to accessible for user with friendly explanations."
4,Eh..,"I got this game back in '01. I never finished it because for some reason, the final boss was impossible to beat (and I was way ahead in levels). I did love the storyline, and the characters were great! Really, had they waited to finish the actual game instead of putting it out early... it would have been perfect. The graphics are... not so great, but the CG cutscenes and the ability to replay them later on is just... awesomeness.Did I mention Seymour Guado? GAH. Will Final Fantasy ever stop making me fall in love? And will Square Enix ever decide to focus a game on the ""bad guy?"""
5,Amazing Game!!!,One of the greatest games evr made! Stuning grapics and cinimatics! You will have hours mabye days of adventures and battles with this game. The battle system has been re-vamped and of course their are new charecters for the player to master.
4,good unless youre a ff freak,"if you have never played a Final Fantasy game before, you will like ffx. Both the graphics and the gameplay run smoothly, the plot is superb, and some characters are unforgettable. But if you are obssesed with final fantasy i wouldnt recommend this chapter in the series. It cant compare to FFVII or FFVIII, and it is too different for a long time final fantasy-er. (You might be saying ""HEY! WHERES LEVIATHAN!"" or ""WHAT THE HECK IS CTB?"" or ""HOW CAN TIDUS' BLITZ ACE DO ONLY 25000? OMNISLASH DOES TWICE AS MUCH!!"" But i still think this is good for a change of pace."
3,this was an ok game,This game had its ups and downs. first the ups are blitz ball is too much fun :) and the sphere grid was a great idea by square soft. on the bad part none of the battles where of any difficulty to me and the worst part is that you cannot lose to the final boss(i tried on my second time through). if it were from any other company other then squarsoft i might give it a better score but i have come to expect too much from them. my advise is to rent the game before you think about buying it.
4,This game is good but square could have done better!!!!!,"Ok first of all it is a good game but it is not nearly as interactive as the other final fantasies(yes I have played other final fantasies beside 7,8,9.) The storyline is good but there is no world map and that means no exploring and no side quests until the end of the game when you get an airship and you just select where to go. Yes the graphics are very nice but the whole game feels like a movie you are watching it more than being in it. The battle system is an improvement though other than only being able to have three or four characters in battle you can rotate them in battle! Now we come to the leveling up system ok it is nice at first but after having to move them across the game board like 40 times it gets a litte bit anoying!Anyway it is still a good game and a quest worth taking!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,The Fantasy of Final Fantasy X (10),"Square has worked of its butt trying to make this game, and it was worth it too! Taking account of all the Final Fantasys this one probably ties with FF7. The battle system is perfect and not to complicated like FF8 is. And the music is fresh and tangy. Plus instead of having 2D backrounds, like all the other Final Fantasys, this one has 3D backrounds,wich would make it so you would be able to change the camera angle! This game for sure is going on my top ten, it should be on yours too. And guess what else is new other then the tottaly high-tec graphics......REALL VOICES, INSTEAD OF HAVING TO HURT YOUR EYES READING THE SMALL TEXT!! Its tottaly worth the...$. Maybe you should buy it from Amazon too.They have the best prices.Just buy it now, it's an explosion for your buck. ( 9.5 / 10 ...)!!"
1,Final Fantasy X,"the game wuz really good but this reveiw is on the few bad things about it. ok here u go1.u cannot skip cutscenes2.i am not an ""expert gamer"" so to me this wuz very hard to finish3.i wish they wud have done the relationship between tidus and yuna would have started earlier on4. they graphics are nice but all cg sequences are5.this is not on the game but a person wrote a review and they did not know that X means 10 so fyi: X=10!6.sum of the fights w/ feinds and bosses are really unfair7.wakka is a racist!8.rikku is treated badly cuz she is al bhed! damn u wakka!"
1,"A COMPLETE LETDOWN, I WASTED MY MONEY",Final Fantasy 10 is lets face it a bad 50 hour long movie. since I am still mad I WASTED 20 DOLLARS ON THIS GAME!!!!! Im not even going to give it a decent review. I mean the voice acting of this game is just sooooo terrible. Tidus voice sounds like hes eleven years old. The story is long and dull if you liked FF 1-9 AVOID FF 10
5,This Rocks,"Final Fantasy X is the best one yet, the graphics are excilent, stunning and above all SWEAAAAT. The quest is shorter this time but the game rocks. The spells, the Combo moves, And my favorate part, the Aeons. This game rocked, although the sphere grid was a little hard to figure out at first, but good things in time.I highly recomend this game,( if you do buy this game be sure to use Kimahri's Lancet abillity alot, you can steal enemy moves). If you buy this game and dont like it you must be crazy on 100,000,000,000,000, different levels.P.S. get this game!"
2,review,"this game is pretty decent aside from how insanely long the cutscenes are. Esp. the one at mihen highroad with yuna, O MY GOD. that took almost 20 minutes! the graphics are pretty decent, probably the best about this game. the battle system, its all right but the turn system is annoying. the little fiend just dances around waiting for u to pick a spell to blow it staight to hell. i would say that the first time u play this game it is fun if you are a newbie to ff and ffx is ur first in the series. its because u dont know what ff was. ffvII was definitly at the top. if this is your first ff game i would reccomend buying it. oh and another thing, what the hell is sin? he looks like a giant blob of horse manure."
3,Lisa,"I got the game a little earlier than most people, and I started playing it yesterday. The game is linear so far, no room to go explore and find secrets and such. I miss that. The graphics are awesome though.. it's definetly not the best FF so far and I've played all of the ones released in the U.S. It's an average FF."
3,I am NOT impressed,"Considering how great Final Fantasy 9 was, #10 greatly disappointed me. I'll start with the characters. The black mage, Lulu, is such a JERK. It greatly disappointed me because the black mages seemed so GREAT but then you get Lulu who has way too big of an attitude. Rikku is cute, though, very cute. Tidus, well, he's OK, not horrible, but pretty OK. Kilmari's pretty cool. Yuna is nice. These characters also have voices which is a real nice addition. Then, the battle system. Ugh, I immediatly was disgusted by the sphere grid for learning new abilities. With the aeons, you only see Valefor and Anima in cinemas, but those two cinemas are awsome. Not only that but super-cool Leviathin is GONE, and so is Carbuncle. The graphics are great though, and the music scores are very good too. The monsters you get to battle are pretty cool looking. Some boss battles can get hard, but they are still pretty neat. The story is pretty well though out, but the ending was too sad."
5,gotta love IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,the reason i like this game is because of the gameplay and awsome storyline. it makes u understand... NOTHIN ELSE TO SAYPS: FF11'S COMIN' OUT IN FEBUARY
4,Good game but WAY to tedious,"Nice graphics, great story, but you need to invest WAY too much time to play. Forces you to take on tedious tasks just to get through the game. This is of course the norm for RPG's, but couldn't someone design an RPG where you can speed up the process of building experience, etc.? If you are an RPG fan, you will no doubt love this game, as it is a crown in it's genre. If you are not an RPG fan, or you never played an RPG before you will probably enjoy this game, but beware that you will need to invest a lot of time to get that enjoyment out of it!"
5,Not a fan of Final Fantasy RPG&#65533;s however&#65533;&#65533;.,"I've never been a big fan of the Final Fantasy series. However, I pick this one up after playing a demo. This game has breathtaking graphics, but better yet, decent game play. The battle system is character turn based, so time stops with each character's turn. With the use of a sphere grid, you can customize the upgrades of the characters. The character attributes are the usual magic, power, and special abilities. The story is not bad either. You play Tidus, a blitzball player whose world of Zanarkand is turned upside down when the evil Sin arrives. Tidus goes on an adventure to find his way back home and picks up a few new friends along the way. My only complaints about this game are that it is a bit too linear and you don't get the use of the world map until late in the game. Overall, I love this game. I've beaten it twice. I now can say ""I played a Final Fantasy game and really loved it!"""
4,Reviews By FreaK,"I've been playing Final Fantasy games for quite a while now. I've played them all, except for 3 and the ones that aren't released yet, and I'd have to say this is one of the best.Here's the good stuff.....The graphics are wonderful, but you can tell that sometimes they are better than at other times. The backrounds are detailed, but a lot of the characters aren't. Most of the cut scenes are very well made...they're movie quality. And at LAST, there are voiceovers! The storyline is also very good, but it can be confusing at times. The music is great, too. It fits the part very well and adds a lot to the game.Now the not-so-good things....There are more cut scenes than actual gameplay. When there is a lot of gameplay, it is usually pretty easy. And the camera views are blah....you can't change them. You don't get to save very often, either.Overall, I'd give FFX a B+. I'd reccommend that any FF fan (or non-FF fan) should play it. At least try it out.... come on, for me? *puppy eyes*"
4,Final Fantasy X,"Final fantasy X is truly a rpg gamer's delight. This game features a captivating storyline, worthy of previous final fantasy titles. The graphics are phenomenal and the character sketches are life-like. The battle system is top notch and a true joy to play. My only drawback was that the game seemed almost too easy, in comparison to previous final fantasy titles. However, this would allow beginner final fantasy players to play with little difficulty. This game is a definite must-have for any rpg gamer. I have had the game for the two years, and still enjoy playing it. I give this game five stars!!"
5,Quite Possibly The Greatest Game Ever Made!!,"This game is an instant masterpiece! A genuine work of art! Worth every penny that you pay for it. Lately, Squaresoft has really bombed with FF8 and FF9 but FF10 brings back the quality of the series with a fresh new battle system and quality PS2 visuals, a real treat for RPG fans everywhere."
3,It was great... but not the best,"Ive been playing rpg games for a while now, and this has to be one of the best visual wise, but gameplay is another story. The first couple of hours are mostly cut scenes which are nice and pleasing to the eyes but leave you with one question, When do i get to start battling? After the first hour or so i began drifting off and just staring at the screen wondering when do i get to controll him? Most of the time you just have to stop where theres a place you can fight and just beef up your guys for a couple of hours because you dont know when youll get another chance. The game all in all is pretty simple. This is the first final fantasy where i beat the boss on my first try (and it didnt even kill one of my guys). The soundtrack is beautiful, the story is great, and i like the new way of leveling up, but this game lacks a key element in the final fantasy saga. the second half of the game was great, but id say the first half was dissapointing."
3,"Too linear, not enough story","The graphics are beautiful. The battle system is the best so far. But this is the first FF that has really disappointed me. It's still worth playing, but don't expect much character Development or an original storyline. Other things not to like: towns are bare-bones, basically a few people standing around and an item/weapon shop so not much to explore; very very linear gameplay, you don't even get a world map until near the end of the game; side-quests are tedious and frustrating; the voice-acting was bad IMHO, and the main character's voice was miscast, too all-American.I still spent the time to finish the game and definately enjoyed the eye-candy, but I won't be playing it again."
1,"Calling this a ""game"" is a generous use of the term","I was expecting this to be a role-playing game, but what I found instead is that it's a movie, albeit one where you have to hit the buttons every few minutes to move the story along.The plot seems very linear to the point where there's not a whole lot you can do to influence it. It seems pretty hard to die, and a great majority of my time was spent watching cutscenes rather than doing any role playing, or for that matter playing of any kind. I'm actually a bit baffled by the sheer number of positive reviews. Sure, there's brilliant eye candy and a gripping plot, but there's no compelling game underneath."
4,Sewing for Fun,"My daughter is only 2 and she has cousins have peg boards that are just shapes that she loved to play with; when I saw animals I thought this would be even better and more interesting for her, and it is. The best part is watching her make sure the ""right color"" goes with the correct animal. (In her mind at least) It promotes hand-eye coordination and gives me some quiet time while she does them. I also am not worried about my 8 month old chewing on the boards, they are pretty sturdy and haven't gotten damaged by new teeth."
4,Joyful yet reverent worship music,"This is the recording of a worship gathering in Africa. There are some Africa-oriented songs (hence ""Rejoice Africa""), but others are just plain joyous yet reverent worship of God (no ""heavy metal""). My favorite is ""Behold the Lamb,"" a musical rendition of the return of Christ mentioned in Revelation 19:11. A very close second is a boy's choir rendition of the Prayer of Saint Francis (""Lord make me an instrument of your peace..."")."
2,Another stupid book,"One-dimensional characters with idiotic motivations. Perfunctory descriptions of SE Asian locales. So dull.Alert! Spoiler Below! SPOILERSPOILERSPOILERSPOILER:Includes the gratuitous death of the titular character in the last few pages; not that the reader cares much about him, even after nearly 500 pages."
3,MIXED UP MESS,"I HAD READ THIS ALOST EXACTLY 20 YEARS AGO AND RATED IT WELL, TODAY I CAN'T SEE WHAT I SAW OR WHAT ALL THE 5 STARS ARE ABOUT, THE END IS A CONFUSED MESS. I LIKED LEARNING ABOUT HONG KONG. D"
5,Le Carre's best novel,"This novel is le Carre's greatest, finer than the previous novel, ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,"" and finer than its successor, ""Smiley's People."" Here le Carre's prose is at its richest and most psychologically penetrating. The parallels to other great ""revenge"" works such as ""Paradise Lost"" or ""Moby Dick"" are evident (note the epigraph to the novel, from a poem of Auden's), and the author's characterization of George Smiley, still his most endearing creation, is peerless. It's my understanding that le Carre had more time to devote to ""The Honourable Schoolboy,"" and the extra effort shows, in spades."
4,large and in charge,"Im gonna be honest, I bought this Huge sticker to make my order over $25 to qualify for free shipping. I gave this to my neighbor who is a skater and he seemed thrilled. Thanks Amazon!"
4,Excellent Hollywood murder mystery,"The second of Stuart Kaminsky's excellent Hollywood murder mysteries. This time Toby Peters investigates the murder of a Munchkin on the set of the Wizard of Oz's yellow brick road. Naturally, Judy Garland is involved too. This is a well-written, fun series that manages to make a good blend gritty detection with light-hearted humour. Such a pity that these books are out of print and many titles are difficult to find. A lovely series."
2,"Get the facts straight, sir.","HUH? 1940??The Wizard of Oz was released in August of 1939! No way would the set still be on an MGM stage in an era when they released a movie a week, let alone a munchkin in costume. The author should do his research."
4,"Great quality, not what I was expecting though...","First off- the quality of the mirror is great. However, I was expecting it to be able to plug directly into the line, or the power cable that I already had from the rear view mirror that came with the car. This one had a whole new wiring kit, which I didn't need. I looked up what kind to buy for my vehicle (1999 Chevy S-10) and all I was able to find was this one. My plug is small and square, where this one is small and oblong, or a long rectangle. I haven't had a chance re-wire yet, but thought I should mention it before someone else thinks the same.Overall, great quality, but not what I needed. Perhaps it is for those cars that already do not have a map light rear view mirror, or one that has a longer rectangular plug, not a smaller square one. Also, if anyone knows if there is an adapter out there so I don't have to re-wire PLEASE comment and let me know."
1,Quality issue on this one.,"Look out. It's hard to look back. This mirror maker has made a lot of mirrors for GM and probably others, but the one I got from them is terribly inaccurate. When flipping the lever to a night mirror, I have to re-adjust the entire mirror itself as the inner angle is way off. It's an unnecessary pain. I'd have sent it back if it hadn't taken so long to find out. (wife's car) Very poor quality control. Paid too much for this $8 mirror. You might ought to pass on this one...."
1,Bad item out of the box,"Well, after reading all the raving reviews, I bought one sealed box from Circuit City. It powered on, but I could not get it to open th etray to accept any media. That was so disappointing. I did multiple factory resets according to the manual but no luck. It was junk out of the box. How does this reflect on Pioneer's QA?I'm gonna get another box and give it another try."
3,Lamest of the accessory's available for MK dungeons,"MK dungeons is a cool game. This accessory, Dungeon Builders Kit, though is more than a little [bad]. The doors don't add that much to the game and are fairly fragile. You actually need several of the dungeon builders sets to have enough tiles to use the tiles in the game. (I suggest 3 set for 2 players) The special squares, teleport and vortex, do change the games strategy a little. The tiles make the board a little more variable. The tiles themselves are made of cardboard and seem reasonable durable. However, making a tile layout that makes sense can be frustrating. Also, there a 3 different kits (labeled 1, 2 and 3)."
1,Useless,"I received this as a gift so I shouldn't be all that upset since I didn't pay for it, but this is a useless piece of garbage. It worked a total of ONE TIME, albeit a long trip from Maine to Cleveland, OH. Now all it does is tell me that I am on Route 2 in Montana (a good 2,000 miles from my home.)"
5,KKSF FM 103.7 Sampler CD,"Great CD just what I ordered and although it had to cross the Pacific Ocean (via I suspect an unintential stopover in New Zealand) to eventually get from the US to Australia, it arrived in perfect condition!"
4,Informational book for my sons,This is a great book. I only gave it 4 stars because the little girl in the book introduces herself as Elisja in English and Elisha in Spanish. I guess its just a typo.
3,Ok but not what I expected,"The dates were ok, however, I was expecting a smaller, different date. They tasted ok however they were not exactly what I wanted to purchase. Thanks anyway. Tasha Halpert"
1,Don't bother. It's a dud.,"Not funny, fake, phony sounds. I wasted my money. Don't make the same mistake."
1,Don't waste your money like I did!,This is a waste of money. I totally regret buying it. The positive reviews were probably written by the producers of this piece of junk. It's a total ... and I hope you don't get fooled into buying it.
1,This thing sucks! Don't get ripped off!,I bought this CD thinking it would be funny based on the other reviews.....boy did I get ripped off! The other reviews were probably written by the artist because they are so fake! The whole CD is nothing but a bunch of phony sound effects...they say it's real sounds but they are obviously lying because the fart noises are so blatantly fake that they sound like a whoopee cushion or something. Don't waste your money on this. And they DON'T offer you your money back so it's nothing but a RIPOFF!
1,"This is GROSS, and I think farts are funny.","This CD is mostly just fart sounds, and only a few songs. That's it. If you want clever fart music, check out ""Flatulina's Fabulous Holiday Spectacular"". It's way cuter. This took very little creativity, it's not funny, just gross."
3,"Good, but fails to live up to full potential","This set has very good resolution, excellent colors and great looks. The big ""but"" here is the screen geometry, which at least in my unit leaves much to be desired. The image is uneven from side to side, being more stretched towards the sides than in the center. This is very noticeable with the normal FULL setting for 16x9 playback, less so with the REGULAR 4x3 ratio. If it wasn't for this, this model would warrant a 4 star rating -it certainly has all the features and adjustments one could possibly want in a TV set. JVC needs to take a look at the picture geometry problem, this crucial adjustment isn't being performed correctly at their factory."
2,DIASCRACEFUL ANALYSIS OF KAFKA AND OTHERS,This horrible essay is written in very bias prose. The analysis of Kafka is blasphemous.
5,a convinced skeptic,This product is awesome. As a former white cakey deodorant user I was very skeptical. It works just as it says even in warm climates. No odor whatsoever and no more white marks to ruin my clothes. Mom and Sis will be getting one in their stocking if they don't get sick of hearing me say how great it is and buy it on their own.
5,"J.Royce Sampson,VP Rock Publications","When it comes to making mistakes in life, this is the battiest. Experiencing bad relationships and young adults getting caught up in the credit card industry!!I think any parent, or young adult should read this novel. Ms. Manuel gets right down with it. She explores all the mistakes a young woman make growing up--and this is the one that can make you or break you."
5,As much fun to browse as to prepare a meal from!,"In The Cool Mountain Cookbook: A Gourmet Guide To Winter Retreats, Gwen Walters prevailed upon twenty outstanding ski lodge resorts from around the country to provide more than 150 delicious recipes that can be easily duplicated in any family kitchen. These wonderful dishes are augmented with up-to-date travel guide information on accommodations, rates, and activities. There are beautiful color photographs of both the food and the lodges. From Spring Onion Risotto with Tomatoes and Almonds (Plumpjack Squaw Valley Inn, CA); Spicy Meatloaf with Caramelized Onions (Sundance, UT); and Warm Chocolate Tart with Banana Compote (Lodge at Vail, CO); to Lemon Poppy Seed Waffles with Strawberry Mint Sauce (Lake Placid Lodge, NY); Chile-Encrusted Pork Tenderloin (Vista Verde Guest Ranch, CO); and Huckleberry Creme Brulee (Spring Creek Ranch, Jackson Hole, WY), The Cool Mountain Cookbook is as much fun to browse through as it is to prepare a meal from!"
4,Ageless voice still going strong,"Sir Cliff just keeps going like the energizer bunny. In this latest collection he has mined the catalog of minor and major classics including for the first time I believe, a Beatles tune.The arrangements and production are once again in the hands of Alan Tarney who keeps it sounding fresh but at times a little too programmed. Sometimes it sounds more 'casio' than 'kurzweil' but overall a great mix and pleasant listening. Standouts are Cliff's version of ""and I love her"" and the Chris Eaton penned, ""let me be the one"". ""You've got a friend"" is a great song but a weak version here kind of lets the side down.If you love Cliff, you'll love this cause for some of us even when he does something crass like ""mistletoe and wine"" we still love him!"
2,Good for 4 shots****,"First let me start by stating (other than long hold time) Simmons/Bushnell customer service was great.Also, had I purchased from Amazon, I probably would have received a full refund.Lastly, if you buy from woodbury, don't expect a return or refund.So why the title, ""Good for 4 shots""?I bought the scope for a deer hunting trip this coming fall 2012.I mounted on a Ruger 480.By the 4th shot I was 1"" high.Adjusted and shot the 5th round.Looking through scope I knew right away I had an issue with the optics.The power settings no longer worked. In fact, the image was smaller and farther away than 1X.Long story short, I would not expect this scope to work on high cal handguns. Possibly look to Simmons Bushnell line of more robust scopes,One star for the build but 2 total for the correct customer support."
5,"nice scope, bright, good focus, clear","At the last minute, I went with the matte black scope. This scope is nice, and keeps good focus thru out the zoom range. Seems to be of top quality. I have it mounted on a Dan Wesson 357 mag (8"" barrel) . Works great!"
5,"""My Camel, is a good Camel""","I woke to find this little guy in my christmas stocking! He is the first ""double-hump"" camel, in my collection! I love him!"
5,Schleich is awesome like always!,"Schleich animals are awesome. They are detailed and painted beautifully and seem to hold up really well too. I have the nativity set and added animals to it. My daughter loves the fact that this set looks like a breakable nativity, but it isn't. Schleich is a winner in my book!"
3,Good Book,I bought this book to get a better understanding about the middle east. I did get the education I wanted but would warn that it is not an easy read. You can get a little fustrated with all the different names of people and cities.
3,"Dry, some parts biased to the liberal perspective","The very beginning of the book and that portion of the book that addresses Middle Eastern history from about 1950 forward is very obviously biased toward the perspective of a liberal academic who sympathizes strongly with the Palestinian view of the region. I suspect this bias is the product of the revisions made since the death of the original author. The history up to 1950 is very detailed and fairly informative, but very, very dry. The sentence structure is a little odd (as in British and densely written) and this makes the reading fairly tedious (fell asleep often).I wasn't reading for pleasure, though, and this text was fairly thorough. When combined with readings from Bernard Lewis and others, this book helps get a good view of history in the region."
4,good player,"After a lot of research, I bought the Ipaq because I was looking for a small MP3 player with a reasonable amount of memory. I use it when I am on the stairmaster so CD sound quality was not an issue due to the background noise in the club. I use music match to rip files from my CDs. It allows you to change the windows media audio compression rate. After experimenting, a rate of 40kbps gives me very acceptable sound and over 3 hours of music."
2,"Flimsy, insubstantial MP3 player","Save your money, and don't purchase this player. Despite what I had heard from others, I did purchase the Ipaq. Just like everybody says, it is darn near impossible to get the player out of the packaging without cutting your hands. I got two cuts, and I was as careful as could be. My first impression was that the player seemed really flimsy and insubstantial. The battery door kept coming open on its own whenever I touched the player. And, the memory door was a disaster waiting to happen. It too was barely hanging on. I was so disappointed that I returned it. Wait for the next model of the Ipaq; maybe they'll correct some of these errors."
2,No good,"I bought my first Compaq PA-1 over a year ago and am now waiting my third. The same thing keeps happening... after some use the player will not recognize the usb connection to the computer, thus making it impossible to write new tracks. This is horribly aggravating, but not nearly as bad as the support for this product. As with any tech support, the tech's tend to know less about the product than I do.I would not recommend this procuct unless you want to keep sending it back to the manufacturer."
1,I am not happy with this purchase,"I bought this machine in October for my daughter for Christmas.The first time we tried it none of the CD's purchased through Amazon would play so we thought the CD's were defective. I bought another Karaoke CD from Target and it played for a couple of minutes but then the words on the screen became all jumbled and just stuck..No movement and no more sound. That is when I realized it was the machine that was defective, not the CD's. When I called Amazon to get info on making a return, they told me we were outside the window for their return policy, even though it was purchased as a Christmas gift. I am so disappointed. I will never make a purchase through Amazon again. I spent just under $100 on a machine that doesn't work and had to see the disappointment on my daughters face thinking Santa brought her a broken gift. I highly recommend that before you purchase this machine, you take the negative reviews seriously. I made the mistake of not using my better judgement."
5,Original or New Remastered Version?,"This is a really wonderful CD. I love the stories and her adorable sense of humor. Here's a little tip...if you're going to pay these prices, make sure you're buying the original version that's no longer available. Christine came out with a new 10th Anniversary edition of this CD that has the same songs and patter, plus a new one--This Little Town is Paris--that you can get through her website for just $15.00. I've heard them both, and one tiny phrase removed from the remastered version, and the added song, are the only differences. So, unless you're a collector, you might want to just go to christineebersole dot com and get the new one."
5,On the Riveria,"Anything with Danny Kaye will be entertaining, I can watch him perform for hours. Being such a talent, he was given great scripts and parts to play. I don't think anyone will be disappointed watching him in any roll."
2,Disappointed,"To be honest, the description said this book was new. It was a Christmas present and I was embarrassed how old it was."
3,insane chops but little artistry,"Gonzalo Rubalcaba and all his cuban frinds were born with inhuman abilities to play fast and unnecessaritly complicated music. If that statement sounds intriguing then look into this cd. But if you can not stand cheesy synthesizers, truly unforgettable ballads, and marathon ensemble pieces, then stay away from this guy. His fusion style is simply not good. The keyboard sounds are out of date for this late of a recording, and unbelievable ensemble work wears thin when you have to wade through half an hour of it to hear a meaningful piano solo. he best tracks are near the end, especially Homenaje, with its complicated beat and great acoustic piano solo. It has all the world music of the rest of the album, but the balance between ensemble work and improvisation, as well as the halway coherent rhythmic structure, make you wish that the rest of the cd was more like that."
3,Weather Report: foggy and cloudy,"I recently discovered Rubalcaba through Blessings, which is a five star recording without question. I was therefore hugely disappointed to discover that Antiguo is mostly a rehash of Fusionist ideas that I, at least, associate with the music of Joe Zawinal and Jan Hammer from the early seventies. There seemed nothing new, and a great deal that was merely silly, overblown, and vapid in this recording. If you feel like buying it, get in touch with me -- I'll gladly sell you mine."
1,It made my daugther cry,I picked this DVD up from my library and I figured if my daughter liked it I would buy it for her. She loves Hello Kitty and this was her first DVD watching Hello Kitty. I wish I would never have showed it to her. It was horrible. Hello Kitty gets into a fight and her friends treat her like crap. Hello Kitty cried and that is when my daughter cried. My daughter cried for almost a half hour off an on. I was so upset about it. I would not recommend this for any child. I have no idea what they were thinking about when they made this.
5,Provacative,"His take on the American religious types like the JW, Mormons, SDA's are excellent. Sometimes people simply need to be given digestible simple examples that speak volumes and not a lengthy dissertation. The author does this well. And I like that he uses the term superstition well.Those who hold onto religious beliefs because of fear of being ostracized, or because they need to ""belong"" or because this is the way it has always been will feel some pain when they read the book. The same way an alcoholic hates to be told he is an addict. In fact that's what this book basically points out. Addicts who are afraid to be healthy."
2,13w Compact Fluorescent,"I needed 4 bulbs for my work lamp. I ordered 6 so I would have 2 spares.4 of the 6 would not light in my lamp. For Sylvania bulbs, I expected more reliablitity.I did not install the bulbs until today. Since it has been over 30 days, I doubt if I can return them for any warranty credit."
5,Still A Great Cookook,"Filled with beautiful photos and wonderful recipes, this is perhaps Julia Child's greatest book. Descriptions of her techniques are made understandable by colorful images so that any cook can whip up a perfectly French meal easily."
2,Not Julia's best,"I have the first edition of this book and had problems with recipes, some I knew were wrong and could figure them out. I heard from the publisher and there were more than 20 mistakes which were fixed in subsequent printings. So if you are buying this do not get the first edition!!!"
2,Very Poor Quality,"I boughtThe Way to CookandThe Way To Cook DVDfor one of my daughters last Christmas and have just had a chance to watch the DVD myself. While experienced cooks won't find much new in The Way to Cook, the book is a wonderful primer for novice cooks but I was very disappointed in the quality of the video, which I found very pixelated and hard to watch. Give the video a pass . . ."
3,Misleading advertisings,This item is listed as The Way To Cook Signed. Any reasonable person would look at this and believe that this is a signed copy. It is not...I wrote to the person selling it and said that they had indicated it was an autographed copy...and they said that these go for $400...not the $40 I had paid. They are blaming Amazon and I told them they needed to straighten this out with Amazon because it makes both of them look bad. I could have bought a new book and only got this one because it was signed...NOT.
2,Stag film on paper,"This book wasn't worth my time. I finished it anyway, but it just struck me as Hollywood. Do you really expect me to believe that a stripper and playboy will realistically fall in love after two nights together. Just a stag film on paper. Also the political officer actually believed what he said. Political officers looked out for themselves. And the last few pages were right out of a Hollywood action thriller with bad actting. If this is what I wanted I'd rent a movie."
4,Compelling Drama,"This is a classic and detailed fictional look behind-the-scenes of the Catholic Church, although its obvious that this fiction is based on reality as the Vatican's consultant to this film was none other that the current Pope Benedict. A tad too long for it's own good keeps this Otto Preminger film from a 5-star rating..."
1,Don't bother with this movie.,"After I read the book by Henry Morton Robinson, I couldnt wait to see the film. What a disappointment! I wonder to this day where Preminger got his ideas for the screenplay,and why he eliminated most of Father Fermoyle's family. Although the acting is good, especially, Tom Tryon ,Burgess Meredith and John Houston, there is just no spark to this film. By using flashbacks, Preminger loses what thread of story that is left.Its too bad that he wasnt even a pinch more faithful to the book,his cast certainly could have handled it. And why oh why were the characters of Gaetano Orselli,Ghislana Falerni, and Roberto Braggioti in particular eliminated. Did Preminger reallythink that the character of Anne-Marie would help the plot?? Sorry Otto, that in itself is enough for a big thumbs down. Add it all up and you still get a big waste of time."
4,research,This is aimed at research and hits the bullseye. Not a how to book but puts the reader in touch with current understandings and needs of the field of grief and bereavement.
5,Very good,"Muy feliz, porque ahora ya puedo utilizar mi lente Ojo de pescado que compré hace una par de meses y tomar muchas más fotografías"
4,Ok for the Cost..,"The Item was little tight to fix the first time..Initially Thought it was shipped a wrong size..But after using repeatedly it now fixes , but have to try a little hard every time."
1,don't waste your money,"anyone who doesn't already know the extremely rudimentary ""information"" provided in this very elementary book wouldn't even make it through an interview. i have found few books as disappointing as this one. it's bad enough to make me wonder whether or not it's some kind of a hoax."
5,Art Blakey Drummer For The Ages,"If you are a drummmer this is the CD for you. Lee Morgan one of best trumpet players that get no respect. Wayne Shorter what can you say one Miles Davis students. At work I listen to this CD over and over. Art just have a gift of getting the best musicians,over the years from Horace Silver to Clifford Brown You better get this one soon before they stop releasing it. This is one the best next to Moanin'"
5,Reeled In!,"A truly enjoyable read, especially for someone who has spent no more than two hours of her life fishing. I originally bought the book for my husband, an avid reader and fly-fisherman, but after scanning the first couple of pages, I couldn't put it down. The story of DiBenedetto's journey down the East Coast is not only entertaining; it speaks of the rich history of a much-admired fish. With his fresh approach to writing full of captivating experiences, DiBenedetto is sure to reel you in from the very first page."
2,Not as good as it seems,"After waiting patiently for 2 1/2 weeks to receive the item, we finally got to assemble the game a week and a half later. Within the first week the player 1 joystick broke. We have made three calls to the manufacturer to get the repair completed and as of today, 1 week later, we still have not heard from their service department. Needless to say, allthough the games are fun, when you can't play them, it is not so great. Purchased 5 weeks ago, been able to use for 3 days."
5,Who Done It,"""Who killed gay bar owner and all-around nice guy Rick Wendell? Was it Larry Johns, the attractive young man found wiping his prints off the still smoking gun mere moments after the murder? If so, why was Johns naked? And what happened to the large sum of money Wendell had just withdrawn from the bar's bank account? Hard-boiled, openly gay insurance claims investigator Dave Brandstetter aims to find out in Troublemaker, the third volume in Joseph Hansen's legendary and critically acclaimed Brandstetter mystery series(...)"
5,Dragonwyck DVD,The DVD came in good condition and it played OK. It is old so I found the audio was not the best. I had to really turn up the volume to hear what was being said.
5,Great Cookbook,"I have made several recipes out of this cookbook and have been pleased with everyone of them. The money was well spent for this cookbook. I would highly recommend it for anyone trying to lower sugar, fat and sodium in their cooking."
3,"Shows promise, but doesn't deliver","Like another reviewer wrote, the price may hold back other friends from using this system. I like the team buttons on the puck, but it is hard to find other people that use the system as well. I found the voice commands unreliable having to repeat some commands, and wasn't worth the hassle for the games that I play."
2,The Curse of Jennifer,"Is it just me, or is every movie that Jennifer Aniston is in cursed? From the Good Girl, through The Breakup, to Rumor has it - every good concept turns into unwatchable mush once she enters the screen. i don't think she's neccessarily a terrible actress, but somehow she just manages to choose material she seems completely unable to connect with. Here, she plays a poor girl who can only find jobs cleaning houses to survive. Yeah, right..."
1,Awful,This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Jennifer Aniston should be ashamed to make such a boring and pointless movie. What a waste of two hours.
1,this stuff sucks,it doesnt work if you dont use soap. ur supposed to use the combination. Anyone who doesnt use soap in addition to this bodywash smells. trust me on this one.
4,"OTTO PREMINGER, OPUS 8","**** 1945. Directed by Otto Preminger. St.-Petersburg, Russia. XVIIIth century. Catherine the Great has just fired her last lover when she meets the naive Alexei Chernoff who wants to warn her against a possible revolution. This film was meant to be directed by Ernst Lubitsch who chose the script before falling ill. Nonetheless, ROYAL SCANDAL remains a sophisticated comedy à la Lubitsch with witty and energetic dialogues. Tallulah Bankhead, Charles Coburn, Anne Baxter, William Eythe, Vincent Price and Sig Ruman are all given the opportunity to present a one (wo-) man show worth remembering. Highly recommended.In addition to the present edition, you can find a zone 2 DVD released by the BFI (British Film Institute) at amazon.co.uk or another zone 2 DVD released by Columbia Classics at amazon.fr."
4,Miss Glady Knight does classics with heart,"I LOVE this CD. This really shows the range of Glady's talent. I feel she gives the original artist their due but adds her own style that only Gladys can do. This CD has a little bit of everything for ballad lovers, jazz, scat, big band and blues. Glady's does not try to overdo or remake the original but she does add a more updated sound. I have a version of of M. Jackson' s See My People Through and I feel Glady's version is just as classy and heartfelt. She doesn't try to overreach with the vocals on any of the tracts but she does compliment each and every song with a style all her own.."
4,Not too bad,"I really like the concept of these and they do look really neat on my tree, however, they can be a bit tricky and you have to fiddle with them if you are plugging them into a new strand of LED lights. Everything fits and they work, however, they don't click in and so are not very tight in the light bulb slot. If the wire from the candle was not positioned just right, it would just fall out of the light strand.I am still very happy with my purchase. My husband would never let me put real lighted candles on our tree so this is a nice alternative to keep up the traditions of our German/Hungarian families!"
3,CUTE but order a 1/2 size larger!,"I loved the look of the shoes and have purchased others by Sam Edelman, however they were the suede and cloth and more comfortable. These, do, as other reviewers said 'cut into' your feet. For the price, I wouldn't buy them again, as I had to take them to my cobbler to have them smoothed out on the high back and stretched a bit so they weren't so tight. GREAT looking shoe tho!!!!!! Fun for summer!"
3,Hadrian's Fence,"I wish I could have enjoyed this book more. Dietrich treats the era well, and the idea of the Wall is relevant to our times, reminding one of the Berlin Wall and of the current American debate over the Fence on the Mexican Border.As a Texan, and as a fan of Historical Fiction, I expected more about a collision of peoples and ideas and less of a romance novel.Nevertheless, all characters were treated fairly and the plot was well developed. I will read more of Dietrich's work, but I do hope he gives up as a romance writer."
3,Historical Romance in Roman Britain,"Historical romance set in Roman Britan. Similar to tales by Frank Yerby or Samuel Shallabarger of the 1940s-1950s. Beautiful woman lusted after by three men: loyal to her husband; in love with dashing rogue; fearful of powerful brute. Guess which one wins in the end.Historical setting is well presented, but story could happen at any time period in any place. Well written if you are looking for a romance, but if you want good fiction that focuses on Roman history, I'd stick with Simon Scarrow, Steven Saylor, David Wishart, or John Maddox Roberts"
2,Research issues,"I commend Mr. Watford for his effort, but he seems to have gotten mixed up on his facts. My ancestor too, is misrepresented. Watford records him as having never married (something his numerous descendants find either vexing or humorous) and attending a college he did not attend. I think that data got garbled in his notes, and that the bio he gives probably connects to someone else. There's likely no demand, but a corrected second edition would keep a lot of family researchers from going off base."
5,this is a really cool puppet,this is a cute and adorable and it is a good size puppetgood for adult hands and for children hands to fit in
3,Nothing that can't be altered,I bought this as a piece to my halloween costume. I got it and was a little disappointed because I didn't expect it to be so long. I ended up cutting a few centimeters of the base of the nose and adding two new holes for the string. After that it was perfect.
4,Penelope for Halloween,"I was Penelope from Penelope for Halloween :) by far the easiest part of the costume to purchase! It's not as cool as penelope's nose, but it's great for the price."
5,Great Footage,"Ii bought this DVD because I was impressed by a similar disk about the War of 1812 and wanted to see more of the older Teddy Roosevelt footage.There is a lot of it - some as early as the 1890s and the cellloid has held up better than I would have expected. It's too bad that sound had not been incorporated with the movies yet because I would have liked to hear Teddy talk.Still, for what is techonoglially available this is very high quality."
2,Too Bad so Limited,"Though I stand in awe of Sue Grafton and her body of work, this book just does not deliver. It is a series of essays with no real tangible advice or meat to work with. When you read the book you are just seeing exerpts and platitudes not an in depth analysis of writing mysteries. Though many of the essays are beautifully written, it feels like you are reading the same thing you read in all other writing books. Kill that demon, called the internet, set down time or word length, make your characters multideminsion, do not be scared of said and asked. It gives no real clues on creating the puzzles that you need to create.My advice, get ""Writing and Selling you Mystery Novel."" by Halle Ephron that has great relevant exercises, and will really help you make your plot and mystery novel sing"
3,Fun does not transcend reality,"This is a whimsical collection of simple, catchy, Moog-driven indie rock with indeed adept use of vocal androgeny. It is only a half-hour long, however, and it carries the same burden of--say--Papas Fritas but without being as musically diverse. It's one thing to revel in geekiness, and that's fine given its time and place, but to call this an immortal 5-star classic must be something of a stretch. It's timely without being trendy, and smart without being as annoying as this review, but a good portion of its slightness is spent in syncopated ""datee la de dah"" lyrics which tread very thin ice. To the sliver who are satisfied with this, I envy you."
5,Seiko SNK797K Automatic Watch,Great automatic watch for under 100 bucks and like the skeleton back. Good looking classic watch style that's not hugh like alot of todays styles are.
5,I miss this show,"This is the show with Paul Reiser (Mad About You) and Staci Keanan (Step by Step).It was a little like The Odd Couple with a teenage daughter. The two dads were opposites, but friends.When Nicole's mom died, she went to live with her father- only her mother didn't know which of two men she had been dating was her father. So, Nicole was given to both of them and the three of them lived together."
4,High on... WHA?,"Wow, listening to this is like listening to slayer bashing an amp over motorhead and then blowing up. Pike is pretty impressive. But, like some other's have said, give the bassist a chance, the distortion overides the whole cd, but I love the bowel loosening riffs and terror inducing solos. He just has a way of making you wanna hear it over and over again. But, yet agian, not a cd to blast on weak amps... your ears will start ringing and you'll be yellin ""someone answer that darn phone!"""
1,DON@T BUY THIS JUNK!!!,"Unbelievable. How can this product have been released by a reputable company like Roxio? It crashes at everything I try to do. There is no support, no patches, no mention by the company of any possible problems. You can run a decryption program like DVD For Free to remove the encryption, but try to get it to chose a language like ""Errr, I don't want the director's comments thank you"" or select part of a DVD (I'm an actor and I just want my bits from movies for my showreel) forget it. Just totally ghastly."
1,Umm...,"Mr. Shirley, how can 1965's ""Here, There, and Everywhere"" have been influenced by 1966's Pet Sounds?"
2,does not work properly,"The keyboard is smooth and lightweight, but the mouse has some problem and I will not use the mouse and not the keyboard and give them as a present to somebody who wants to repair something in the mouse."
1,Schoon/Schoom shenanagans,"Since this book was released it seems to have stirred up quite a debate about it being about Roy Pascal's number one disciple John Schoon and his ginger chin. Now I for one was expecting many intimate details regarding the life and times of one of the gratest of Roy's . How could they leave out the likes of such annecdotes as ""MFI pickup point"" and the attempts to exchange empty bottles of wine for a Franc a bottle during leave in France. What took the biscuit were the vain attempts to feature Schoon in the book to appease readers like me. The mention of a man wearing a Santa Pod raceway jacket being part of the RAF Mechanic squadron in the Gulf was encouraging but was hardly expanded on. A great pity for a book with so much potential.When it comes down to it, I believe this book to be unadulterated tripe and feel totally ripped off by the publishers and author. Roy would not be pleased."
3,INAUDIBLE TIMER,"This is a dandy little timer except for one thing: I can't hear it if there is ANY noise in the room. If you don't have excellent hearing don't buy it. On the other hand, if your hearing is good and you don't need a loud ring it does several things very well. It can keep track of hours (up to 99) and minutes on one side and minutes and seconds on the other. You can do both at once. Then when the time is up it resets itself. You still have to push START though. It does ring for 30 seconds, which helps. It has a magnet on the back for the frig and also a push-out stand. A very good value if you have excellent hearing.Amco Double Digital Timer"
3,"One of the better ""bootlegs""","The main event here, the German gig, sounds like your typical analog audience tape from the mid-'70s - but you may find that preferable to those mis-mixed soundboard tapes on the Rome '74 and Palasport albums. In which case, this is the best place to experience those extended versions of `Nothing At All' and `Plain Truth'. Another highlight is the extended version of `In a Glass House Part 2' with a typically fierce Gary Green solo (though this was previously released on a UK edition of the Glass House album). Best of all, there are a couple of less familiar tunes, both from the Three Friends album - `Prologue' (played very fast!) and `Schooldays' (undated, obviously a bonus track from an earlier show as the sound quality isn't as good). The US '75 bonus material unsurprisingly has the best sound quality anywhere on the disc and includes the `extended' Octopus medley (for comparison with the '74 model) and, always a pleasure, `So Sincere'."
2,dull dull dull dull dull,"While I liked the climatech, and the relaxed attitude toward apparantly non-harmful designer drugs, everything thing else was a 'tad' boring. Its pretty bad when you don't care for any of the characters. And the fried-brain scientist- he had the *answers* from his 5 minute venture as the human computer, so *why* did he need to go back in...surely someone would have been able to examine/debrief him afterward. And then to let him walk around freely while barely functioning? Didn't make sense."
1,This is not science,Please do not take this as a serious science book. It's not. It's religion with fancy science words wrapped around it. :-(
5,satisfaction guaranteed,"People may joke that Tamara Monosoff became a millionaire with the help of suckers like me buying her book. THAT IS NOT THE CASE! She is an extremely intelligent and fascinating woman. If you cannot launch your own business after reading her book, it is in no way Tamara's fault. I am amazed at how much time and effort she obviously devoted to writing this book. Just when I would ask myself a question regarding something she wrote, she was answering it in the very next sentence. The book is FULL of helpful examples, websites, and addresses. I would STRONGLY recommend this book to anyone."
3,"Morally Aimless, But Interesting","I understand the concept of forgiveness, and it's a beautiful thing when the offended party chooses to give it. But when those untouched by the offense stand on the sidelines and cry on behalf of the offender, I'm left scratching my head. That's what this film seemed to me to be doing. And just like in real life, you can sympathize with the criminal until the moment you put yourself in the shoes of the victim. Then you'd just like to see the criminal kicked off of the planet so the rest of us can focus on being nice to each other.But as long as you don't ask yourself how you really feel, or what these characters would really do, or why they're doing what the script has them doing, or why the f-word is used 500 times, it's an interesting movie."
3,"Look at picture, because it doesnt say DEEP DISH","I just got this as a gift that I had in my wish list, My mistake was not Looking at picture, I read that is was a griddle and didnt notice it was a deep dish griddle, Im not really sure WHY they would make a DEEP griddle, My idea of a griddle is to be able to flip foods easy, well with High sides I might as well use a skillet, But I do thank my Girl friend very much for the great gift :-)"
3,nice book,cute series...I still can not understand why you DEMAND it write a certain number of words!! I t was a pretty light read.
2,Bored to Tears,"I am not sure where the 5 stars come into play, as I could not make it through a quarter of this book without yawning. I gave it two stars because of the writing and charity, but there was no intensity, emotion or spark. I skipped large chunks looking for something....anything. Do not waste your money."
3,Great DVD,"Bull Busters is a great DVD for any type of rodeo fan, it has great picture, and great rides, anybody who appreciates rodeo will appreciate this DVD"
3,good product,"This product came exactly as it states, very fast delivery, I was unfortunate that I bought it, because I had also bought a fuel sender and didn't think it came with it, but my loss, anyway it is a great product for replacement, I would recommend it if you are only replacing an existing gasket."
3,What the f. . . .,How can you charge me the same amount to ship an item as it does to purchase it?I can't believe it cost $5.00 to ship a $5.00 item! Can't you just put it in an envelope and send it U.S. postage? Wow! . . . what a rip-off!
3,It's Entertainment,"The colonization project didn't get off to a great start, and now Kalypso (our heroine) is about to get bitten by the secrets her elders have been keeping.Dreaming in Smoke served to occupy a few hours, but I have to say, it wasn't good enough to recommend. I never was much of a fan of stream of consciousness, particularly since I never have believed the character's stream. Kalypso is annoying. The whole colony could suffocate, and I really, really wouldn't care. There is a happy ending, yes, and that's nice. I'm not a believer in killing everybody just for effect. But it would have made it more interesting.I was uncomfortable with some of the science, as I'm almost sure there were some howlers I'd have caught if I paid the slightest attention in highschool biology, or taken chemistry. Ah, well.So, don't rush out and spend your money on this one. It's okay, you won't be outraged, but look for it, if you decide you want to read it, in your local second hand bookstore."
3,A lesson learned,"A summary course in afluence and downfall through the eyes of one family. However, they did manage to do some good in this otherwise wicked world."
4,Little Mermaid 3D Reels,"Haven't used the 3D Reels as of yet because they are part of a Christmas Present. My little two year old granddaughter loves her view master, however so I am sure she will be thrilled with the Little Mermaid 3-pack set. It was so convenient to just click on the computer and get what I wanted instead of running all around trying to find the product. The service and condition of the 3-pack set is great. Thank goodness for Amazon.com."
3,Gaelic is not for the faint of heart,"A difficult language to learn, and even worse to master. The letters have a different sound to them than any lanquage based on the Latin forms. However, it is helping a great deal in my quest to conquor this old, and very melodic tounge. Now I just need to work on my brogue."
3,Scary for the little ones,"Very well done version of ""Christmas carol"" buy it was a little dark for young kids and the older ones thought the story was a little slow. I personally enjoyed it very much"
2,Not For Kids!!!,I found this way to scary for kids. I think this should be rated PG-13. I would never watch this movie with a child. Why did Disney make such a creepy cartoon?
2,Dissapointed,I just finished watching this for the first time and I was rather dissapointed in it. I think Disney could have done a better job and it was hard for me to sit all the way through. Unlike most of Disney's movies I wasn't able to really get into this classic tale and I found it rather dull and for my tastes to dark in some parts of the movie.
4,Great animation and effects!,"One of my favorite roles for Carey, added a nice presence to this old story. Loved the camera prespective, well done!"
2,Too Much Tech,"Obviously, someone learned (invented) some dazzling cgi techniques, and made a movie to play with them. Some of the effects made me dizzy and nauseous."
3,Couldn't Hear It!,"The sound on this video is turned down so low that we had to turn the volume of our TV up full blast, and then move our chairs closer. The movie itself is good, but the sound quality of the actual video was very poor. I think Disney might've done this on purpose to keep people from showing it to large groups."
1,"Not uplifting, downright scary","I've seen other versions of A Christmas Carol and this one is not good. Very scary. My kids did not like it at all, and we know the story. Too much left out, dialogue hard to hear... yuck, yuck, yuck. Don't bother. Go rent A Christmas Carol starring George C. Scott. Now THAT is a good movie."
2,Scrooge,"I expected a lot more from Disney and Carrey. Of the 7 versions of ""The Christmas Carol"" that I own, this is the worst one. I would not recommend it if you have ever watched and like the Christmas Carol movies. But if you are into Halloween, you might like this one --- It felt a lot Halloweenish to me."
3,Not suitable for children,"Its a decent movie....for adults. I have a 7 year old who has seen all of the pirates of the carabean movies and was not scared by them but I will not let him watch this one, its to scary."
2,Not as good as I hoped.,"Slow, uneventful, and LOUD. I was hoping that I could add this to the family collection of holiday movie traditions, but I was very dissappointed. If you're going to tell such a familiar story as this, it better hold my interest and move quicker. As one reviewer said, I didn't connect with the characters either. I actually fell asleep at the beginning, only to be woken up by ghost Marley's howling and chain shaking. Didn't finish and don't feel like I missed out by doing so. Spend your money getting Polar Express on bluray instead."
1,Far too Scary,"My husband and I rented this movie, looking forward to watching it. We both enjoy most Jim Carrey movies, and like the story of the Christmas Carol. But this movie was so frightening! I jumped five times while watching this movie and did not enjoy it. I would not recommended this movie for young children! Other reviews here mention their children having nightmares and that is not a surprise to me."
1,Disappointed,We were very disappointed in this version with Jim Carrey. It was quite boring. We like the original Christmas Carol and even the Muppet Christmas Carol. We felt no Christmas Spirit in this movie.
1,Disney's A Christmas Carol,"Every year I look forward to watching A Christmas Carol and over the years have watched many renditions of Charles Dickson's famous classic but this version is by and far the worst I've ever seen. I eagerly awaited Disney's version and had high expectations since Jim Carey was the voice of Scrooge. As I watched Disney's version I had a hard time staying awake, and my sister who was also watching, or should I say tried to watch, this version fell asleep half way through the movie. I found it difficult to connect with the characters and found the ""spirit"" of A Christmas Carol to be lost."
3,It Was Just Okay,"Just another movie is all, nothing that noteworthy here. The characters seemed a bit lifeless, the pacing was too slow, and the sound equalizing was terrible (I had to constantly turn up the volume to even hear what was being said, but then turn it way down again as the sound effects and music got way too loud)."
3,Streeming video,The quality was pretty good but not the highest quality like blue-ray disksPlease improve the quality of your streeming to blue-ray
5,Dickens Christmas Carol with Jim Carrey.,"I so enjoyed Jim Carrey in Disney's ""Christmas Carol"". I had been wanting to see it since it was released and finally bought it through Amazon. The story was very close to the book by Charles Dickens. I was amazed at the amount of big named actors in the movie also. Disney ""did it"" again."
4,Wonderful animation,This movie was done very well. The animation was wonderful and very life-like. It was perhaps a little too realistic as my 6 y/o ended up covering his eyes at several parts in the story. The ghosts are pretty frightening for little ones. But my husband and I enjoyed the remake of this classic.
1,NOT FOR KIDS! A CHRISTMAS HORROR MOVIE,"""A Christmas Carol"" is my all time favorite story. I have seen every version ever made including most plays. This is an over the top Jim Carey movie. I watched it with my 7yr old grandson and he was so scared he couldn't sleep. All the horror took away from the moral of the story. It makes me very angry that Disney was a part of this. THIS IS A CHRISTMAS HORROR MOVIE not for children. So many good versions out there, get one of them and let Disney know this is UNEXCEPTABLE!"
1,Go for the one with Mickey instead!,There's no way I would let children watch this horrible version. It ranges from just creepy scary to stupid humor.
1,A Movie not for 3D animation,"A Christmas Carol is a story that needs real set, and people. The story is there, but hard as they tried in they're animation effort the facial emotions are not. I felt disconnected. It is because of this I hated movie. I am glad I rented it. Thank God for Redbox."
4,Decent Movie,"My kids are entertained by it, and that's about how I judge a movie like this. I would have liked it better if Jim Carrey's ghosts weren't so annoying, but other than that, it's pretty good. Besides...Gary Oldman is in it. Isn't that enough?"
1,Foul tasting,It might be good for your teeth and gums but I couldn't keep it in my mouth long enough to find out. It is so salty that it burns the tongue.
1,native american doll,this doll really looked cute. When i received hrr i wss very diappointed in looks clothes hair. She looked like a doll for a 8yr old. I collect native american dolls statues. I put it back in the bag they shipped it in. Could of at least put it in a box with popcorn shells from postoffice instead just through it in a bag and sent it out very dispaaointed never again. Very bad workmsnship to much money looks like a doll from dollar store.
3,Good for Beginners,"This is a good little book to keep on your shelf if you're just getting into crock-pot cooking. The book is divided into categories: recipes with beef, recipes with chicken, soups, recipes with pork, etc. The recipes are VERY easy and fast prep. which I really like.However, with that being said, we tired of the recipes quickly. A lot of the recipes are repeated throughout the book: for example, several of the recipes use the same ingredients, you just replace the chicken with beef. And because of the simplicity of the recipes, most of them are very plain in flavor. But if you have some imagination you can add your favorite ingredients and do your own variations.As I said before, a great little book for starters. But if you plan on using your crock pot more than once a week, you'll tire of these recipes quickly."
1,Quick yes - tasty - NO,I have tried numerous recipes in this cookbook and have been completely disappointed. I was excited as they seemed very simply and quick so I dove in and tried a couple as soon as I purchased the cookbook but they were awful! I am afraid to try more in case there is more disappointing recipes ahead...maybe the recipes were made with the focus of simple and not on taste...this is not worth the money!
2,Not full meals,"Not imaginative, simplistic recipes for partial meals. I need full meals, not just slow cooked meat."
2,Easy - but unimpressive,"The beauty of a slow cooker is that you can dump things in it, go out, and come home to dinner! Further simplifying things by using ""ingredients"" like condensed soup, pie filling, and cake mix is not only insulting, but unhealthy. Unfortunately, most of the recipes in this book rely heavily on prepared foods (Scalloped Chicken calls for 1 box of scalloped potatoes, 1 can of chicken, and water). The recipes that shine are the ones (such as Cranberry Pork Roast and Almond Chicken) that use basic ingredients instead of prepackaged foods."
4,Binding,I like the binding of this book. Makes it easy and portable to read. Recipes are simple but nothing new.
5,GREAT,"This is a great look at a great player. So much detail, Beckham goes deep into detail about his life. If you're a soccer fan this book is a must have"
1,King Of Marketing!,"It has been many years since this guy stopped worrying about playing soccer, and focused solely in his obligations with sponsors, in posing for photos, etc. He has won absolutely nothing in Real Madrid, a team so engulfed by its millionaire stars that no coach can make it work as an efficient soccer team.It's useless to read a book about this narcisist guy."
4,great political/conspiratorial/action comic,"I read this comic because of its premise: a team of ordinary military people whose job it is to bring down out-of-control superhero types. It was a great read. The art, however, was lacking--too many over-muscled, steroid-pumped characters with not-so-well drawn faces. It reminded me of why I hated the Image comics of the 1990s. Because this book was so well written, I was able to plow through the lackluster art.The good thing about volume 2 is that you get an infusion of new artists who give Team Achilles a dramatic improvement in the art."
5,"a very well written, very likable novel","For Kings and Planets was one of the best books I've read all year (and I'm up to about 50). Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found the very typical Midwesterner a unique protagonist and thoroughly enjoyed reading of his seduction by the world and its offbeat inhabitants. What made this book stand out, however, was the way in which Canin allows him to play out; Orno judges without judging, and we all should be so clever."
5,There but for the grace of God go I.,"Like all the greatest fiction, Canin's ""For King's and Planets"" allows the reader simultaneously to fall in love with the characters and to thank God he is reading about their lives and not living them. This coincidence of feeling -- a sense of identification with and empathy for the characters, a desire to steer them away from the course they've set for their lives, an acknowledgement (as with our own lives) that eventually this is merely another experience of the world -- provides a powerful force that urges the reader through the book. Add to this an ability to create phrases from our language that by themselves will soothe your soul, and you realize again the wonder of the best fiction. Read this book, then read Canin's others."
3,Could've Been a Lot More.,"I really wanted to like this book more than I did. The friendship of Marshall and Orno was appealing and interesting at first, but then things took a turn after the first 150 pages or so. The book turned into the courtship of Orno and Simone, Marshall's sister. That didn't hold enough interest for me. And Marshall's character changes after you think you know enough about him to tell his personality type. Canin throws us a curve when Marshall says and does things you wouldn't think he would. Also, the ending lacked substance. The book vividly describes 1970s New York City and the other geographic locals, which is a plus. But I think Canin should've focused on the friendship between the two men more."
4,"beautifully written, honest book","I defy you not to be moved by this novel. You discover the world -- of New York, of love -- as Orno discovers it; at first seduced and dazzled by it and by the outsized enthusiasm and depth of information of his friend Marshall, and then in a deeply felt, personal way. Canin writes about the hesitations, the fits and starts, and later, the love, between Orno and Simone with attention and grace. Get through the first fifty pages -- something seems off about them, but you discover in retrospect the reason for that. Don't be swayed by the cynicism of the other reviewers. Come to this book with an open heart -- as it was written."
2,A DISAPPOINTMENT,"Sadly, the writer has run out of things to say and has produced a banal novel for commercial purposes. Hopefully, he waits several more years and gains some maturity before he produces his next."
5,the cheapest and most rewarding vaction you'll eva take,"Absorb RHP's CD and get ready to be inspired! In one of the best tracks on the album, OBESE, Shred Lexicon tells us ""My rhymes are obese""- the album proves itself worthy and Obese is a perfect way to sum up Rat Race Vacation. Their outstanding lyrical style and creatively crafted beats crack open a most worthy sound delivering a tasty helping of what is sure to become a new standard for informed hip hop heads looking for an inspired musical experience. Regenerated Headpiece's inventive style has me listening to the album over and over--every time I discover new grooves and rhymes that wont quit."
1,championship pool this is not,"I'll try to keep this as concise as possible.The controls suck, the sound effects are poor, and the game play is rather awful. On top of that, you will never find anybody playing online, which is where the game could have been interesting."
4,Horrorific no wave punk disc(h)ord like the Swans or Suicide,"A rare record if you can find it. The ""band"" Glee Club was an experiment by Washington DC punk protagonists John Stabb and Tom Lyle immediately following the demise of the band they were in together for nearly a decade, Government Issue, and was issued in 1989. It's not really melodic or easy to listen to. It is more like a book you can't put down or a bad car accident you are unable to not gawk at (or in this case, listen to), to see what happens next. I found it really intriguing. Dark ""lyrics"", which are more like gutteral moans and noises, with a weird organ/keys throughout, all puctuated with curious sound effects like a B-movie horror soundtrack. Slightly dark-wave, no-wave and Goth-like and very much noisy like their contemporaries, the East Coast hard core bands Swans and Suicide. If you like either of those bands, snag this LP.I couldn't stop listening to it"
5,What I Liked about Katie's Gold Medal,Katie's Gold medal is a great book for a girl or boy who dreams about being a gymnast. This book teaches you a lesson to never yell at your dad when he's trying to teach you something so you can win a gold medal.
4,Learning from Jesus,This book outlines some of the basics that JESUS taught on the Kingdom of God and prayer. Great sort read on prayer
5,easy read,it was concise and to the point. It was an easy read. I enjoyed it and will follow its principles.
4,Simple Truth is Often the Best,"A book easily read in one sitting, but worth reading more than once. A good reminder of the importance of pray as the primary source and strength of the Christian life, and a simple approach in how God has commanded it be done. If any one practice is absent in the Church today, and any in great need of revival, it is prayer, and Murray brings great teaching on this point."
4,Great lesson,Gave me new insight to effective prayer. i heartily recommend this short readingTo anyone who wants to learn to pray.
4,Lord teach us to pray,This book is a call to prayer. It propels you into the place of prayer. You can hardly wait finish the chapters to go and pray. I gave it 4 stars for its length.....wish it was longer
1,Not so good,It's not a book but a hand typed 8 1/2 x 11 stapled thing the cover was nice but that is about it. I was expecting a book
4,Great book,"What a wonderful read . Every Christian shown read this book to discover a closer walk a fuller, richer prayer life."
5,Wonderful! It's about time!,"I was so excited to see this book! After reading it, I can't wait to get the next one in the series! It's perfect for kids!"
3,???????,I honestly don't even remember buying this but I guess I did so here goes. It's sand paper plane and simple. The fact that I do't remember buying it means that it probably din't suck or I would have written a review a lot sooner.
2,iPod Screen Replacement,The lack of viewing angle on this LCD replacement screen is a big disappointment when watching videos. Everything else about the screen is decent enough.
5,Works great!,"Replaced my broken screen with this one and it works great, no issues. Several step-by-step guides for replacement can be found on youtube."
4,GREAT GREAT,THey shipped within a decent amount of time and I recieved my item quickly. I enjoyed the service and the ease of the product for fixing my iPod!!! I WOULD ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN!!!!
5,Thanks,"Works great, went on the internet to find out how to pop ipod apart and it took like 10 min and saved me $150 because i didn't have to send it in to apple. Thanks"
4,Works as expected,"I was very happy with this product. After taking the ipod apart and installing the new screen, it worked perfectly.Pros-Works as expected.-Detailed instructionsCons-Bad packaging - Placed in a bag rather then a semi-decent card board box.-Have to go to a web site to view instructions"
1,never finished it,"i thought it would be similar to the fruit hunters, which i adore, but alas, i could not even finish it. there was too little substance and too much fluff"
5,Mega WOWs,"Just finished the book - what a trip! I can only imagine the stories that weren't put in the book. While I was content with cymbidiums, dendrobiums and a few other wonderful babies - now I truly want a Chinese cymbidium. What an amazing journey - I had no idea - I was just loving and appreciating my babies - after reading Orchid Fever, I'm more discerning, protective and in awe of these beautiful plants/flowers. Imagine, now I'm part of an international madness from which there is no cure. My garden will never be the same!"
4,Orchid Fever,"""In my 40 years as an orchid scientist, author and book editor, I have never read anything quite like ORCHID FEVER. It is part absurdist black humor and part horticultural expose. Mr. Hansen displays a rare talent for capturing the allure of orchids, describing the dubious characters who lurk in the shadows, and exposing the small handful of self-appointed power brokers who rule the orchid world. Frightening, funny and full of tantalizing insider knowledge. And yes...there are strange and wonderful stories about orchids as well. I have a distinct feeling that what was left unsaid about several people is much more interesting than what was written. I look forward to a no holds barred second edition.""Dr. Joseph Arditti Editor, Orchid Biology Irvine"
5,Obsessed indeed,"Folks who harbor a passion, such as Bruce Chatwin's Meissen porcelain collector in ""Utz"" or Eric Hansen's scent-addled Japanese in ""Orchid Fever,"" hold a fascination for me. In fact, I own up to being a bit obsessed for Hansen's books. I've read all, including his orchid obsessional, with the vigor that overtakes you when faced with one of those don't-look-up-till-you're-done reads. Now, I'm more than eager to check on my friends who proudly display Phalaenopsis in their public rooms to search out how many they may have tucked away behind closed doors."
1,Savage Cry by Chas West.,Chas West must need money for an installment payment on his jet cuz this work is formula stuff and shouldn't make it out of the bathroom. In may case it didn't . . . Disappointing as in my opinion Elmar Kelton and Chas West currently set the standard in their genre.
3,"Not the best chrysanthemum tea I've had, but not bad","I didn't buy this off of Amazon, I got it from a chinese grocery store for about $6. I went for dim sum with my family and my mom ordered chrysanthemum tea and it was really good. I bought this so that I would be able to enjoy the tea at home instead of having to go out to a restaurant just to enjoy the tea. The tea I had at dim sum was pretty much all flowers and made a greenish yellow tea. The Golden Dragon tea is >90% dried greenish/brownish leaves and <10% of flowers making a dark brown tea. This doesn't taste the same as the other tea. It's not bad but if you're looking for a chrysanthemum tea, look for one that is all flowers."
3,Not exactly what I had hoped,"Being the cough and cold season, I wanted/needed some chrysanthemum tea - a drink that I learned to love while in Penang, Malaysia. The dried flower tisane, available from my local Chinese herbalist, helped to soothe coughing quite effectively but it is a little pricey.Seeing this listing on Amazon for ""finest quality"" quality tea at a reasonable price, I ordered a can for home and at work. The listed product is (apparently) a dark, well-fermented tea that is slightly flavored with a few chrysanthemum blossoms. It has a not particularly great flavor, and is not the product that I was seeking."
3,Mediocre,"The book was just okay as a very basic overview, but I was disappointed. A very superificial overview of each topic that was presented, much was redundant from other texts. For example, how many times can one read about using the MMPI-2 in forensic assessments. Furthermore, the cover said that the book covered newer malingering instruments, such as the MPS. However, the coverage of the MPS was about 7 lines and pretty useless."
3,Superficial and mediocre,"This book has a superficial review of issues in forensic psychology. Perhaps useful for a student in an initial review of the subject, it lacks any depth for the practitioner who is generalizing skills into specific areas in the forensic domain. I am sure there are more useful and valuable books for the practitioner."
5,Homeowner,"Item is smaller, lightweight and more versatile than the full size models. It is very easy to use on a small areas for quick clean up, and works well on large areas too. Very easy to clean when finished. I owned the larger model before, and I like this much better. It cleans just as well, except it has no hand tools."
1,Save Your Money,"I wish that I had never bought this steamer. It was a total waste of money. It does an awful job - does not clean well, rugs still look dirty and streaky. I hate this machine!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Bissell 2080 Powerbrush Steam Cleaner,"I love this machine. I have even cleaned large rooms with it. It cleans beautifully. The only negative is the size of the container that holds the shampoo and water. Even though it is necessary to refill and empty many times, the results make it worth the it."
5,Unbelievable!,"For the size of this product you will be amazed at the way it cleans. I love this product. It's light, easy to you and cleans GREAT! I'm glad I got it."
5,Excellent maching,"I am very happy with thisw little rug cleaner. I ordered it so that I could clean my motor home carpets. It is light weight, easy to fill and empty, and does a really great cleaning job. You won't go wrong with this product. I will also use it for rug cleaning in the house."
4,bissel carpet cleaner,product works great. you will need to go very slowly over the carpet to get the water up a few times but the carpet dries quickly and it looks new!
4,Works well,"Small, lightweight, and easy to use.I used this to clean my white wool area rug and bedroom carpets. It works well and removed everything but one old tomato sauce stain (nothing I've used so far has done the trick)."
2,cleans well but doesn't suck up the water.,"the cleaning process was great, however, after washing the machine did not have enough suction power to take all of the water off the rug."
2,Hoary old chestnut,"""Dishonored"" was Marlene Dietrich's 2nd American film and 3rd under the tutelage of mentor Josef Von Sternberg. This is a 1931 release so the traces of silent films are still evident with minimal dialogue at times. A hoary tale of a spy who falls for a traitor, Dietrich is approximately half way betweeen the German hausfrau she had been and the sleek manicured Hollywood icon she became. The story is unbelievably banal, not helped by the miscast Victor McLaglen as the object of her affection. As usual, Von Sternberg provides some exceptional set pieces with lighting to match so the film looks good but in this case, it simply can not overcome the stupidity of the screenplay. It is a turgid boring film.The print of the film is adequate but the DVD contains no extras."
5,Style!,Nancy Beth Lawter has a style that makes you long for more. This book keeps your mind racing till the end. It is a must read.
2,Wont recommend,The product does not look same as what is displayed and disappointed. I would recommend buyers to stay away from this product.
2,3rd year psychiatry resident,"I'm currently a 3rd year psychiatry resident and fairly comfortable with computers. I thought this book would show me unique ways to apply computers to psychiatry. Instead I found it to be a small manual explaining the very basics of computers. The only section that's unique to psychiatry is the list of psychiatry related web sites. Unfortunately, this list is sure to be out of date by the time of publication. Someone interested in such a list would do better to look at NAMI's website. If you're completely new to computers this might be the book for you but it's far to basic for anyone else."
3,Very overpriced but gets it right,"Cons: $50 for 2 pieces of plastic that probably cost < $1 to make.Pros: Maybe you can make that $ back in your golf games, bc this thing does help. It's just a typical swing path guide, but the design is easy to remember and visualize when hitting the panic button on the course in search of immediate ""go-to"" help."
3,QoS back then?,"Did I skip my history? I didn't know there was data networks in 1899, or having to deal with converged networks back then!"
2,IT WORKS BUT DONT FIT,"It did work with my Nissan Quest 2001, but the standard base didnt fit so I had to use the old one... but at the end it fitted and worked the way it should be."
3,"Great gift for the bibliophile in your life, but...","I got this for my bibliophile wife. It's cute and she really enjoys it. As a gift, it went well with the Bookworm video game for the Gameboy Advance. Unfortunatley, the metal caused an alergic skin reaction. So if you are alergic to some metals used in jewlery, be caseful. She keeps the back coated with clear nail polish, that seems to do the trick. But I doubt the charm is all stainless steal as advertised."
4,"Not bad, not bad at all","OkaySo this isn't Halo, but it isn't half bad, I bought it on an impulse, I was really going for a sports game, but it turned to be a good desicion, Sulu can be annoying but all in all the action isn't bad, and for people who actually like Star Trek it is fun. I like the Wraith fighters, and the unpredictable objectives.All in all it ain't bad.Thx"
4,"I.S,S - EXCELCIOR",this is one good star trek game that has a good trek feeling to it.but it has one problem it is really hard even when it is set on EASY. On a second thought when you ignroe the funky graphics its an ok game but not the best.
2,could have been great...,"This movie had a promising start and I was very interested. However, as it progressed it actually bacame quite dull. Sophia Loren was only in the movie for a brief time. There is very little action in this movie, which is okay if there is some suspense, but there really isn't much of that either... maybe a little, but not much. There are much better WWII films out there. Try this one if you like, but I would recommend something else. If you like George Peppard, check out ""The Blue Max"". That's a WWI movie and is far more interesting than this one."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"How do you rate something this bad! Not the movie itself, but this sorry excuse for a DVD. I thought I was getting an official MGM release, but instead I got a very cheap poor quality transfer. Just wait to see this movie on Turner Classic Movies, or wait until MGM decides to release the movie themselves, which I hope is real soon."
4,Don't say action-packed,"Although this movie is great, action-packed is not the right words. The movie tells how three British spies infiltrated the German rocket development site for the V-1 and V-2. It has a wonderful cast including George Peppard as the main character. This movie is mostly based on fact and a great deal of care went into making it true to the story. The acting, sets, scenery, special effects, and music make it a WWII film well worth your time. So although it isn't action-packed, it keeps moving at a good pace, and should entertain the whole family. I bought the DVD and the quality is excellent. No extras are included unfortunately."
3,Very Strange indeed...,"Boy did I get fooled! Thought it would be grandiose like some of his other work, wrong again. This one bored me as much as 'Amarok"" did. Too much studio 'noodling' and not enough serious playing."
3,"Unfortunately, the remixed version of ""Boxed"" set...","I've been waiting for years a good cd rendition of this album: unfortunately in vain. The choose version for the remastered edition is that of ""Boxed"", remixed by the author but not the original version appeared in 1974. Anyway, the sound has a good rendition, the sound is more clear: the depht and definition are better cause the use of HDCD technology. But the cover printing is less quality (!) than the normal copy of cd, and the artwork is not that of the original LP sleeve. In fact, a good occasion throw away..."
5,I still miss this program,"Like all its other fans, I fell in love with Homefront from the first episode. I converted many friends into watchers. It was a beautifully written and acted glimpse into life just after WWII. The characters were real, mostly good decent people, flawed but generally likable.I have never been as upset with the cancelation of a show as I was when ABC took Homefront off the air. It's been 15 years and I'm still mad.Two years ago I discovered that American Life was running the program. I was able to watch the series a couple times before it was replaced.For those people that have been living on their memories, I can assure you that it was as great as you remembered it: the on again off again romance of Jeff and Ginger, the dignity of the Davis', the snobbish Sloans. Truly a wonderful viewing experience.This is one boxed set I would absolutely buy. I hope an official release will come out soon"
3,"Conservative, but very readable","The authors explore the usual catagories of futurism: medicine, transportation, comunication, etc. Most of their predictions are fairly conservative. Where I found the most interest and actually got a ""Wow!"" was in their predictions of medical advancements in the next twenty years. If their predictions about cancer treatment, gene replacement, and hormone replacement therapy come true, our lives really will be changed in significant ways.Although, as I said, most of what they predict is not all that astounding, I found the book very readable and enjoyable. It was much better than ""2025."""
3,Average!,"Usually, I enjoy most all of Linda Howard's books but this story left me unfulfilled, don't get me wrong the story is still doable, it's just missing that Howard ""umpth"" she is so well-known for. At least in my opinion. I did however, enjoy Allison Leigh's story. I liked it a lot better than Ms. Howards. This was the first story by Allison Leigh, I have read, but it won't be my last. I will go in search of more books by this writer. I liked her a lot!"
4,Beckett Short No. 11 - Stirrings Still and What Is the Word,"Stirrings Still is also available as Beckett Short No. 11 where it is paired with What Is the Word. Stirrings Still, a study of death and movement - constrained, absence and free, I have already reviewed. What Is the Word is a short and effective piece on aphasia as, perhaps, brought on by a stroke. Both pieces are brilliant, vintage Beckett."
1,Why is this thing so bad?,"This thing is junk. A 5 month life span is rediculous. I see this thing as a golden example of the trend of American society to buy the cheapest junk we can and then dispose of it when (not if) it breaks. What a shame to go through the process of producing the appliance, packaging it, shipping it half way round the world, and marketing it, only to have the main nut strip out in 5 months with no availability of replacement or repair. There's not even a good way to jury rig it. Shame on me for buying it."
3,Could be better.,It could be better.But I like Mike Oldfield very much so I have to keep this CD in my collection.Roman
4,Sorted - Best of Love & Rockets,"Great disc! Listen to it constantly... truly a well-thought-out 'best of' collection, combining the many facets of the band. If you're a fan, this is a must have."
2,The second half flops!,"The first half of the book is the story of returning the wolf to Mexico, and it is fabulous. Had the book ended with this story, I would say this is one of the best books I have ever read. What Cormac McCarthy does next in the second half is bizzare - he writes page after page of boring drivel. It is like a football team playing in the superbowl, ahead 45-0, and then ending up losing it.Toward the end, I did not want to finish reading this book, but I had to just to see if there was some point for this Jekyll & Hyde performance. I found none. It is almost as if two different people authored this book. Very bizzare.On the strength of the first half of this book I give it 2 stars."
2,Terrible,"This novel is terrible. It could easily be 200 pages (half of the total) and lose nothing from the whole of the story. It seems self-indulgent, unnecessary, and occasionally incoherent. Do not waste your time."
2,The Crossing,"Until I read this book, Mccarthy's several other novels had impressed me. The Crossing is tedious and often illogical regarding plot and motives of Billy, the protagonist. Far too many stories of other people's lives that have nothing to do with imtegrity of the plot. This novel seems to be looking futively to relate SOMETHIG, but fails."
2,"A dusty, bloody mess","What a long, tiresome, hackneyed description of Mexico, complete with dusty streets, maroon sunsets, sultry and serious women, plates of burritos and beans, and bandits popping out from behind the sagebrush. On top of this belittling and stereotyped background is a character who learns nothing from experience and continues to follow a path of stupidity. McCarthy writes much of the important dialogue in Spanish and rarely 'translates' with any counterpoint English dialogue or explanations. If you don't know Spanish, be prepared for many frustrating pages, or else keep your Spanish dictionary handy. Maybe a master like Hemingway or Castañeda can pull this off in brief spurts, but McCarthy fails. I gave it two stars because it actually does have some wisdom, in the form of philosophical dialogues."
2,"McCarthy is grossly overrate, to judge by The Crossing","THE CROSSING is the first of the Cormac McCarthy novels I've read; I am rather confident it will be the last. This writer is grossly overrated. His style is that of someone who wants to convince us that he is just an ol' cowboy story-teller, never really tried, you know, to be a writer-type feller. Frightened to death by Faulkner, drunk on Hemingway, his prose is overwrought, outlandishly affected. Much of his stuff wouldn't get past the admissions process in any respectable school of writing. It is quite amazing to me that this sort of fraudulent material passes muster with supposedly sophisticated agents, editors, and publishers. National Book Award? God help us!"
1,Great Writing?,"I see ""great writing"" in some of the other reviews. I found the opposite. I also found it hard to continue after meeting the 78 word sentence in paragraph two. Then the silly indian character appears with unrealistic dialogue. Did not finish it, nor did I get very far into it before giving up. And that with having nothing else to read at the moment.I think it safe to say I have discovered myself to not be a fan of McCarthy, whose novels seem to be consistent with the author eliminating things such as character development, pacing, plot and plot resolution, punctuation...etc. And most are depressing to boot."
1,Needed an English - Spanish dictionary to understand the book,I couldn't finish reading this book. There were too many sentences in spanish and I was confused with the translation or at least the assumption of a translation with the response. It was really really boring and just couldn't continue and didn't understand the true plot and content. The cover should at least warn the potentiel reader that you have to be fluent in spanish to read the book. Seriously.
3,Haunting and depressing...,"I agree with most of the reviewers that this is an excellent book, but is very much a tragedy. I was so moved/upset/depressed by the first section, which to me is very very sad, that I found it difficult to sleep for two days. I am not usually that moved by something I am reading. That being said, like a good film, I was very emotionally attached to the characters and the outcome. I went on to read the third book of the trilogy, and it too is a tragedy. While I found the stories to be very sad, the characters are wonderfully developed and I find myself still thinking and reflecting on them and their saga. I highly recommend all three of the books, but not for the squeamish and weak of heart."
3,"Good survey of Military Strategy, Logistics and Tactics as they relate to business","Corporate Combat was a recent pick as business strategy and military strategy are closely related and business can benefit from the lessons of military history. While the text was published in 1984, the principles and conclusions remain valid. Peacock has made a thorough survey of business's actions in terms of Military Strategy, Logistics and Tactics. His sources and cases are reliable and on point. If he would have moved a step further to analyze if the actions taken were the appropriate strategy in terms of military analysis, it would be a more complete study. When all the elements are considered, the author has done a good job in identifying actions and behaviors."
4,A short book on value investing,"A short book which gives you the basics of value investing. The toolbox in chapter 3 is very useful. It tells you how to find value stocks, how to dissect the financial statements and which ratios constitute a good buy."
1,"full of lies, propaganda, and hate","This year, 60% of college entries will be female. Look at this spring's honor role listings. Last year, 78% of honor role members in my community were female. Schools are fails boys - not girls.If you wish to waste your time on a politically correct diatribe that is full of anecdotal and subjective pap, then get this book. If you want to really improve the quality of education, there are thousands of reads better than this."
4,Nice under cabinet lights,"These are really nice but you need to order the molex connectors if you are hooking them together. I found this out after I got them. I ordered four of them and I had some trouble with damage during shipment- one had the light bulb damaged, the replacement that was shipped had a plastic end panel damaged, and one was DOA. However, I must say that Amazon's customer service is outstanding. They took care of reshipping the items and now all my lights work and I'm happy."
3,Doesn't include power supply!,I spent an entire evening seaching the site trying to find a replacement for my desk lamp. I settled on this one. Description did not explicitly say that it DOES NOT INCLUDE a power supply!
3,Nothing Special Here,"If you were expecting another soundtrack similar to Gettysburg, forget it. There is not as much depth or inventiveness with ""Hunley"", although it has its moments. Perhaps this was a budget effort owing to the fact it was composed for a made-for-tv movie. Still, if you like Edelman in general you'll probably tolerate it. This soundtrack emphasizes the dramatic aspects of the movie more than the romantic."
2,An opportunity blown,"Such a wonderful book has been brought down several notches by employing a reader that puts one to sleep. My travels are made signifacantly more enjoyable by listening to books-on-CD while driving. I've tried several times to listen to the Civil War but had to give it up. Mr. Whitener's voice is so drone and expressionless that I quickly loose interest. Sorry to be so negative, but this CD is very disappointing. Stick to the book."
4,Mcfly - Rock n Roll Band With A 60's Twist,"I don't normally write reviews for singles, but I decided to for this one (Five Colours in her Hair) as it's a bit different to the other music that's in the charts nowadays.Think back to the swingin 60's, when The Beatles were huge! Right, well if you liked their music you're definitely going to like Mcfly's. Their style of music (in this single, anyway) reminds me of the music from that era - 60's style rock n roll. This single contains all the beats and harmonies that you would expect from that era. It's great!They are becoming ever more popular in the UK and are supporting Busted on tour. Their latest single that has been released in the UK is called 'Obviously' and once again reminds you of a style of music that is remembered well by those 50 +, but it is great to be bringing it back to a younger audience.Mcfly are a young band that should be watched, to see if their album (which hasn't been released yet) is as good as their single releases."
2,It works but dim light,"Received in 5 days(including weekend.) Ordered this for the Panasonic bathroom ceiling ventilation fan light fixture. General Electric brand new in paper box.Expensive and not very bright, not a defect, they are all like this. It works but I really don't like this type of light bulb, dim and depressing light, with the exhaust fan light cover on, can't see much, light is dim yellow light, almost useless, but it is a match for Panasonic bathroom ceiling vent/light.Now I need to buy more for other Panasonic bathroom exhaust fan/light replacements in home, I found the same bulb thru Amazon link at 1000bulbs.com for $1.90 each, but freight is $10, worth it if only I buy more bulbs than what I really need. This one for $7+ is not worth what it does, but I had no choice."
5,A Very Enjoyable Read,"I bought this for my daughter who loved the first book in this series, ""Ella the Elegant Elephant"". Here, Ella longs to feel helpful while assisting her mother in their bakery. She embarks on a slap-dash cake delivery to prove herself adept, a journey that could spell trouble if Ella doesn't take it upon herself to finish up what she's started. In spite of the obstacles that ensue, she displays a tenacious handle on things. The message of striving for personal responsiblity doesn't come off as heavy handed, cloaked in slap-sticky scenes that are whimsical and funny, and finished off with a nice, quiet end that brings the tale full circle. The story is rich and the illustrations strikingly detailed. We are really enjoying this book."
3,NOT PERFECT YET!,"This is a good product to use with multiOS. However, there are still some glitches on most users. The GUI interface is nice but if you have USB mouse, it will not work and tab can not get to individual partitions. Furthermore, it created one big ""MultiFAT"" to store all your OS. If that partition goes bad so are all your OSes. Finally, the SC implement a DOS and NON-DOS FAT switching, thus, if the boot commander is bad, DOS will not be able to recover your other OS and/or data in other primary partitions. I found that the program is convenient to use and recommend to those who are not satisfy with one or 2 OS. However, I would like to warn all about the glitches so you can prepare and protect your data."
5,Masterful,A masterful second book that lives up to everything that was laid down in Moonspawn. Many more creative acts of debauchery and a captivating series of end sequences make this a must book to buy :)
1,Just doesn't feel right,"I bought this hoping it would give me frizz control and a soft, silky feel, but no, it was the complete opposite. My hair felt really gunked up and dirty. It felt heavy and weighed down. So for me, this is a no go. Redken is usually pretty good but this just isn't for me."
3,A history lesson,"The narration in this production is a bit tedious However, as an explanation of events of the war, quite complete. If fact, to absorb it all, you might have to view this several times. What I found totally disappointing was the repetition of the footage. Some scenes maybe as often as five or six times on one disc and repeated on the other discs almost as often. When repeated, the scenes didn't fit with the narration and, many times, the narration would be on the subject of French troops and the scene would be of British Troops! I am presently watching ""The last Voices of WW1"" And I recommend you spend your money on that instead of this.Jim B."
1,Not Functional,"This one didn't work at all for me. I then got a different cheap cable that worked fine:FIREWIRE DV CABLE CAMCORDER FOR CANON SONY SHARP JVCIt looks like the prices, vendors, pictures and possibly products change regularly on these cheap cables (for the same link) - so caveat emptor."
5,Works great,"I bought this to convert my old Hi 8 mm digital video tapes (that's right, digital from 1999) and store them as video files and eventually place on a DVD for keepsake.Works great even though I had a bit of a time figuring out how to store on the computer. This cable sells for a lot less than the ones advertised for $50 + and no video or audio distortion what so ever. A great product."
3,For Mike's fans only,"this is an Orchestral version of Tubular bells.simply nothing new is not going on in here,orchestra sounds nice - but what for buying something that can't beat the original version?as is said,it is only for die-hard fans,the rest can be sure that they are not missing anything..."
3,Kind of weird,It felt like two short stories were put together to make one longer movie. The story felt disjointed and that much was left out that would have made it much more intresting. I rented it because it was filmed near my home and used actors that I have watched in local productions. Fortunatly for the actors there are other parts that have been much better for them.
1,Minimal documentation and on-line customer service.,"The AXIS OFFICEBASIC PRINT SVR USB ( 0171-004 )is accompanied by completely inadequate, obtusely written installation instructions. There is no telephone based customer service (perhaps that is a blessing) and my well constructed questions sent by e-mail were answered so incompletely as to render them unanswered. Their response was exactly as if they did not fully comprehend English syntax (DUH!). I hold a Ph.D. (and thus can be assumed to have at least average intelligence) and have considerable experience constructing, using and servicing computers and LANs, however, I was completely defeated in my efforts to connect the AXIS print server to my network; the documentation and customer service helped not at all. Shame on Amazon.com for selling this product to persons who are not I.T. engineers.By the way, when you return this product because it did not meet minimal expectations for usablity, you will pay the return postage."
5,Great,My 20 month old loves it! She laughs and enjoys it every time she gets to watch it at home or while out.
3,Love the old standards but . . .,"Sorry to rain on other reviewer's parade, but Maude just doesn't do it for me. Why? Well, she kinda sounds like Joan Baez. Nothing wrong with that. If she were singing ""Diamonds and Rust"" or ""Simple Twist of Fate"" I'd love it. But here, I'd prefer to hear someone like Diana Krall. I'll be saving my money on this one."
5,Musical communication,"Maude Maggart's emotion-filled, vulnerable vibrato instills each song with magic. She does what singers used to do routinely - communicate the essence of the song with the listener - rather than simply wail away with meaningless ego driven vocal gymnastics, excessive melissma and mike-aided belting that show off vocal pipes but hide the composer's intentions. She is an artist with a real voice! Some may not like her reedy soprano, but they can't deny her solid interpretations. I find her enthralling."
2,"Nothing New, and Poorly Played","These pieces have all been recorded by other artists, so I had hoped that Ludwig Guttler might offer something new in his interpretation or his quality of playing. Unfortunately, this was a disappointment. Guttler's thin sound just can't compare to the likes of Maurice Andre, and there was so much poor intonation that I couldn't believe they allowed this recording onto the market. This is glorious music, but look elsewhere if you're searching for excellent performances."
1,Didn't work!,"This did not work, once I plugged it in the red light came on but that's about all that it did. I even tried this in 3 other cars and got the same results"
2,not what I expected,"I'm not crazy about this book - images are not as clear as I'd hoped, and there's little info about the buildings. After flipping through it a bit, I will donate to my local library...perhaps someone else will find it more useful."
3,Just an EP,"But here is my Review of this Beans CD released in 2004.""Structure Tone"" has sick verses by the man beans.""Win or Loose you loose"" has yet another good beat and has a underground beat layed down.""Mutescreamer"" has a nice beat layed down also has a catchy hook and raps by Beans.""Data Breaker"" he goes more to the old 92 Comm since style with a tight beat.This is probally the best song on here.""Gold Skull"" sounds like KRS-One from the early 1990's at least in voice.""Composition Voice"" is another standout track on the album""Crevise"" has a high quality beat the quantity is not full but the Quality is great.""Mutescreamer"" has a nice beat layed down by Prefuse 73.""Freak the Beat"" is a instrumental.This album is worth 3 Mics but I hope people will by it because Beans is a very talented MC.No this is not top of the line but it is better then some of the albums out today"
4,SECOND GREATEST CIVIL WAR MOVIE EVER MADE,"EXCELLENT MOVIE, SECOND ONLY TO SHENANDOAH IN THE GENRE OF CIVIL WAR MOVIES"
4,Good Movie,Yvonne DeCarlo was so beautiful in this movie. She and Clark Gable made a handsome couple. It is a good movie. I enjoyed it very much.
3,bringing it closer,"The Olympus 550 UZ has a built in 18x zoom which is pretty neat. However, by adding the telephoto converter lens, that boosts it to about 30x zoom. You get what you pay for. The quality isn't great, but the price is reasonable for what you get. It definately does bring the subject closer, without doing it by adding digital artifacts. It isn't professional quality, but it's good for the hobbyist who wants something a bit better than what he/she has. I took pictures of some vultures nesting in a tree over 1000 yds away. The image wasn't truly sharp, but I could see the beady eyes."
2,Where was the Editor?,"Don't get me wrong; it was a good story. I enjoyed the various escapades of all the women as they grew from young wives to mature women. The men, however, are such shallow caracatures of the sensitive good husband, the redneck jock, and the abuser, that we never really get to know them.As Peggy (the narrator) matured and became a top bridal consultant in Dallas, her grammar was still as stereotypical ""Texas"" as it was when she was an uneducated young wife.Another thing that bothered me was that the blurb on the back refers to the wives ""going to London to see Princess Elizbeth get Coronated"". This never happened."
1,Agree with other reviewer: a pointless book,"After I finished this book, I wondered why it had ever been published. The characters, all military wives stationed in England in the early 1950s, were completely interchangable. There seemed to be no character development; all of the characters were two-dimensional and, most of the time, unlikable. I wondered why Kath, the English character, even bothered with this group. And the ""gimmick"" of including recipes for each character was completely gratuitous. It was as if the author decided: 1) write about a group of self-centered women, 2) include recipes, have an instant hit!"
4,Gets the job done.,"Since Verizon tries to make you pay to transfer pix from your phone, I wanted another solution. Datapilot works as advertised. I am able to send pictures, both ways from phone to PC and back. The transfer process does take about 30 seconds/picture.I likewise can download ringtones to my phone. However the ringtone editor is somwhat weak so you may need another piece of software to convert your MP3s to ringtones, then easily import them to DataPilot.The back-up mechanism for contacts was simple and straight forward."
5,Some addictions do not come upon you immediately,"I first heard the Einstein on the Beach recording the year after it came out. I was in high school at the time and was not fully prepared for what it presented. I could never get it out of my head for many years (nearly 20 I guess). The syncopated one, two, three, four lyrics and shifting rhythms are mesmerizing and.... addictive. I have after rediscovering Philip Glass become completely addicted. This recording is a remake of the original and is really hard-core Philip Glass. Let me just say this, however... If you're a kid and you play this at home, it will drive your mother insane."
5,Unbelievable,"After all is said and done, I guess I would probably say that this 1993 recording of 'Einstein on the Beach' is the better recording. It's difficult though, because there are definately things I like more about the original recording, such as the colder recitation of 'These Are the Days' in the first Knee Play. Overall though, this one is probably better. It is about 38 minutes longer, and the ending is in tact, which is important. The ending of the original was good...but perhaps a little abrubt. Anyhow, this album feels more organic, more refined, and this is it's strongest point. The ""opera"" itself is truly one of the most incredible pieces of music you're ever likely to hear, and with every listen it only grows more so. I wish everybody would give this music a chance. Sadly, most people I've played it for tend to dismiss it immediately. It's difficult, but it's brilliant."
3,Bissell Vacuum Review,I like a lot of the features of this vacuum. The suction power is extremely good. I really like being able to turn the power off for the brush to do hardwood floors. My house is 50/50 hardwood and carpet. I love the separate power brush for doing my stair strips. I like the removable cannister although I would have preferred a longer hose for cleaning the stairs. It would have been a little easier.I absolutely dislike the placement of the cord. I have to wrap it around the top of the handle so I don't run over it. I also dislike removing the dirt. It gets up into the filter area and you have to use a screwdriver or something to get it out. You also have to be careful not to knock the vacuum over when using the tools.
2,A page-turner no doubt but,"This book is indeed a page-turner BUT I don't find it particularly well written (even for Douglas Kennedy's standards)and also, one of the reasons I kept on reading it was there are hardly any separations/gaps in the whole text, so there is no stopping point, so to speak.I find it isn't very subtle and it could have been 1/3 slimmer and none the worse for it. What are the editors thinking/doing these days?!Also, the whole Lizzie part seemed to be added as an afterthought. In my opinion, it would have been better to mention Hannah had had 2 kids, one sentence would have helped the whole Lizzie story seem more natural in the story-telling.The author keeps using the word ""assorted"", for some reason.I was expecting the last Billy twist, so all in all, it is indeed a book one wants to finish quickly, but that's about it, it doesn't haunt you after that, like a good book or indeed a good movie does."
1,This used to such a good game............,"If you are a fan of HOMM III and prior, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. You will hate it more than you have hated anything else in your life. The game has lost all of the charm and structure that existed in HOMM III, and was replaced with a visually chaotic, tedious and overly complex game. Do yourself a favor and avoid this game at all costs."
4,This isn't as bad as people make it.,"Most of what should be said has been said.Like the previous HOMM's, the music is absolutely stunning.Unlike the previous HOMM's the storyline is extremely well done and addictive.All in all, a great single player game, but a horrible multiplayer experience."
5,Very Cute and Great for Kids!,"I love Tamagotchi, and I saw this tape and got it out. It's funny for Tamagotchi and non-collectors, and has a music video and an art lesson at the end. Tamagotchi have to go to Earth to complete the museum before the Great Gotchi sees that the museum's deprived of the display from our world. Tamagotchi (14 I think) find our appliances intruiging and good representatives of Earth. I get it from the library every time I can find it, and I would recommend it to the fullest amount."
1,bhowani junction,"I read this book 30 years ago & I just read it again, its a fine story by a good English author, so I thought I would watch the video.Sadly Hollywood has taken this fine story and just about changed it all around & not for the good - it must be to satisfy the film Moguls.Could do better"
5,Very informative of our jury system.,This shows that our system is in great need of improvement. Great reading if you want to know what happens to jurors behind the scenes. Shows how people trying to do their civic duty are treated.
3,How do you teach vocabulary?,"While I agree with the other reviewers that the story is fun, I dislike the insistent footnoting of 'vocabulary' words on almost every page. Readers or listeners with good English will pick up most meanings from context, and the definitions tend to be just a small step simpler than the original (e.g. ""alliance: union, cojoining"" (sic) on page 6.) Unless the book is being assigned as a class lesson there is no good reason to pepper it so."
4,nothing else on the market!,"After ringing various beauty salons and searching through boots, I realised there was nothing on the market to lighten dark eyebrows.... only to darken them. Therefore as a last ditch attempt I tried Jolen!Perfect ! My eyebrows look stunning after just ten minutes and very natural. Note wipe the remaning bleach off with a tissue before washing your face! Try it."
3,This was not my favorite bleach product! It ...,"This was not my favorite bleach product! It had a fairly strong scent, and was overwhelming to me. As for its effectiveness, it worked great. If you don't mind the smell, it's a good product."
4,A must for Neuropa fans,"I was only recently introduced to the music of Neuropa. In my search for new titles I came across this inexpensive maxi-single of ""Bound"" and am very glad that I did. In addition to the single, extended, and hotel n mix versions of ""Bound,"" you get the two tracks that make this CD so special.The Iris mix of ""Bound"", by Matt Morris (who has since left Iris), takes an already fine song and elevates it to another level entirely. The arrangement is superb and the intensity and emotional level of the song is raised accordingly.And finally the excellent ""After the Rain"" completes the track selection. The song owes much to Depeche Mode, but is a fine melody and arrangement nonetheless. It has taken root in my head and will not leave.For Neuropa fans I can't recommend this maxi-single enough - a real pleasure."
1,"I agree, this book was just about useless","If you think you can fit all the details of your wedding plus brochures in a one inch thick binder, you're kidding yourself. Basically, I took everything that came in this binder, and put it in a 3 inch binder. The only thing that I find useful are the tabs and business card holder page. I could have made those for less than $20. Everything else you can find on great wedding planning websites like theknot."
4,Energizer Easy Charger,"It should have come with 4 AA battery, but instead it came with 2 AA and 2 AAA battery.The rest is ok."
3,Disappointing,"Not at all what I expected. The photography is beautiful, but with the exception of about two patterns (the only two I'd seen before I bought the book - big mistake!), every pattern seems to be a boxy, shapeless tube made in funky raggedy knitting - more pop art than garment, reminiscent of the seventies. There are some very cute and funky hats ... but most of the sweaters I won't ever make."
3,one missing person,"I bought a copy of this book a few years back & really enjoyed it. Though there is one serious flaw in this book. The third & youngest Halloway brother Brice who is mentioned by name in the book a few times but never makes a actual appearence anywhere. In short, Brice is like a invisible ghost. Talked about but never seen, not even at the book's ending wedding scene. Maybe Mary Davis should rewrite her novel to include Brice. Surprised no one else ever noticed this."
2,What was I thinking..?? UGH!!!,"First time I looked through this book, was curiosity of my local library. Checked out, and was blown away with how cool this book is. That was 9 months ago.Being a big U2 fan-and since the price had dropped considerably-decided to buy the book. After a few minutes of 'reading' it, realized how crappy the pictures in the book are. Seemes like 90-99% of the pictures are washed out, grainy, and horribly reproduced here. Was there any quality control as this book went to press? And for those 'new, never before seen pictures' they are pretty ho hum. Because its not totally horrid, I'd give it 2.5 stars. Just, well, disappointing. If I had to pay the full MSRP, I'd give it ZERO stars.While I must say, for $14 or so, you do get some good training on how heavy your next laptop will be...."
4,"OK, It's actually pretty fun","Well, I have to amend my 2-star review of this game. It's pretty much got me hooked, and I have a fun time with it. The developers have made a few changes to the game that perk it up a bit, and the game is deep enough to where you can grow into it. The only remaining problem I have with the game is that it does take a while to figure out how to really enjoy it. When you first start out running transport or mining missions it can be a bit tedious. The solution I found to this is to occasionally enter the ""simulator"" mode and get some heated PVP combat practice. Joining an active squad is also quite helpful to game enjoyment. The game continues to be actively developed, so it continues to grow and improve. If you give it a chance, this one's a winner!"
5,Incredible!!,"Through sheer scope and magnitude 3DO has created one of the most impressive games to date. Every time you log in you are guaranteed a new experience as the combination of software upgrades, and player agendas ensure an ever changing environment. This game is not for the individuals who can not commit the time, and effort through the first several levels as initial game play is slow and frustrating. However as soon as you begin upgrading your personal resources, weapons, and financial resources this game really takes off. A must have for anyone who enjoys combat flight SIM's with political overtones."
1,Hold Up Without A Gun,"This game is frustrating because when you purchase it it seems like a good buy but the actual truth is that you can only play it multiplayer online and, when you decide to get online to play, first you have to pay a registration fee and then a monthly usage fee and not to mention for the time on the internet through your local internet provider. Overall it is a bad program design UNLESS you are willing to pay all the fees."
3,Good fitting but poor quality and workmanship,"I bought this from Amazon about 2 months back as my second helmet because I wanted a full face, but one which can be opened easily for putting on and removing glasses. Here are pros and cons in my opinion:PROS:- Modular design works for me and provides some flexibility for communication devices and ease of use when wearing and removing glasses- Lot of padding inside for comfort and snug fit- Vented design allows for air circulation with minimal noise- Straps are reasonable quality for a standard helmet- Comes with a cloth bag for storageCONS:- The red lever to slide open the front module (not just the visor) upwards is clunky and does not operate smoothly- The visor is made of cheap plastic and can be easily scratched- When wearing sunglasses, the visor produces different colored hues which could get distracting- The helmet feels heavy, especially on the front side (I have used other full face helmets in similar price range which are lighter)"
3,amusing but disappointing,"although this is a classical story and it has a good amusement value, I think that this performance with kristie alley and mr bridges is somewhat disppointing if compared to other versions of the story. my advise is to try other versions."
5,Spanish keyboard to USB only Dell.,I bought a Spanish keyboard as a gift and had to get a cheap solution to mKe it work on a USB only computer. This was my second choice but it worked like a charm. No issues.
5,Perfect for KVM switch,"This is one of the few USB to PS/2 adapter that works with Cybex / Avocent KVM switch without skipping, multiple entries or lack of power draw from the Keyboard PS/2 input.The cables was thinner than the older version of the same model from IOgear but I have not seen any degradation of performance."
5,What a voice!,"We always knew Rodney would make it. And around these parts we call him the kind of the big finish. If you have never seen him live you might find it hard to beleive he is even better but he is. Buy this CD and try to get out to see him too. He has this range that really jerks at your heart strings. He is also the kind of guy that jerks at those strings too, a very sweet, humble and honest person."
4,Happy with this purchase,Very happy with this item. Super easy to put up. Lightweight & stretches a lot to fit many stuffed animals. Can't beat the value for the money.
3,"Nothing ""jumbo"" about it","It's a pretty nice hammock, but was surprised when I realized how small it was. Doesn't hold a whole lot. I also didn't realize I would have to drill three holes in my wall."
3,Small Hammock,This is not a Jumbo Hammock. It is a small Hammock. Was disapointed with it but the seller is good. Received the item fast. Thanks for the item.
5,Fits more than it looks like.,"It looks a little small out of the package, but fits a lot of stuffed animals for it's size as it stretches out. I drilled the little hooks into three studs in the corner of my wall and packed that thing full of animals and toys without any problems."
3,It is Jumbo,"Not exactly what I was looking for, but it is useful. Holds some of the larger toys and stuffed animals like the kind they sell around the holidays. If you are looking for something for smaller toys, I would highly recommend looking at the hanging chains that they sell. I would however recommend this product for the larger toys."
5,Holds well smaller things,We put this in our daughters room and it will hold about 20 small stuffed animals. It is not very large and it would not work for very large or heavier stuffed animals or dolls. Overall a great product to keep the floor cleaned up in her room........would buy again.
5,Wise Purchase,This was a great purchase for me. The net and border are both very stretchy so make sure you put the ends far enough away from the center. Holds quite a few stuffed animals (We have about 15 of varying sizes) and was a good product overall. The only problem I had was that the wall anchors did not work well for me. This was easily resolved by using some of my own.
3,Useful but small,"Easy to install. Much smaller than it looks in the picture. Not really anything wrong with it, but I expected more."
3,"Works, but stretchy",I ordered 2 of these for my daughters room. They hold all of her animals but the material is a little too stretchy. It's great for the price and it keeps her toys off the floor.
1,Very very small.,This item is tiny. The net will barely hold 3 or 4 regular szed stuffed animals. Either amazon snet me the wrong net or every animal picured in the item photo is 4 inches long. An absolute waste of money.
3,"good quality, too stretchy","I bought 4 of these nets to help keep the rooms less cluttered with stuffed animals. They are big and hold a lot, but quite stretchy. A little TOO stretchy in my opinion. They are good quality though, and like I said, hold a lot. However, you must plan to hang them high, Our stretch down about three feet when they are filled with animals. Keep this in mind so that you plan the space appropriately."
1,Not what I expected,I was very dissapointed when I received this product. It is NOT what is pictured on the site. Only the sides of the hammock are stretchy NOT the mesh itself. The holes in the hammock are only about a centimeter in diameter the picture shows them much larger. This will not hold many stuffed animals.
4,Quick delivery,I ordered two of these hammocks and was surprised on how quickly they arrived. Hammock is definitely jumbo -- both kids' stuffed animals fit and there is still room. Definitely recommend this product.
4,Does what it says.,It really does what it is supposed to do although the screws made huge holes and they fall out if there is too much weight. Other than that it holds a lot of stuffed animals and does what it says.
3,Poor directions,"Not very impressed with this because the directions did not really tell you the best way to hang it, so you have to wing it. The first time hanging it, it was all messed up."
5,"Easy set-up, great space saver!","This is a great product for anyone looking to organize all those stuffed animals that seem to accumulate over the years. Set-up took all of about 3 minutes and my wife arranged the animals inside the net so that they all face out and look at our children when they are in bed. Kids love it! At first I thought it wasn't going to be big enough but I was very surprised at how many large stuffed animals it holds. I recomend placing the biggest ones in first and then stuffing the smaller ones in around them. The only draw back is that retrieving an animal can be a bit tricky because we have so many crammed in there. An additional net would probably solve this problem but we do not have another corner that would work. Overall, great space saver and organizer!"
3,Not really that big,This is not Jumbo. Hold your arms out in kind of a circle. That's it. Not very deep either.
3,wanted a more comprehensive package,"i found this compliation too small to be called that. but in my continued search for 80s videos to buy, i came across a web site called MissMyShow ([...]). there i found 2 box sets of dvds, 12 dvds in total, containing 100s of videos. each box set costs about $30US. i thought i'd pass it on in case anyone is interested. 80s music is well worth the search and expense!"
1,Carmen Rosa.,"Mr Von Vacano had the experience than many had[have] in many countries,but he never mentions in his articles the lack of freedom in Cuba. His book describes his experience, but I find interesting on why he came to the States and not Cuba? I did not like his book because is more fiction than non.President Morales of Bolivia , is now the subject of his admiration, but he would not write about the persecution that the Free Press is suffering with Morales.If he is interested in Socialism?Comunism; why he lives in the the land of the Free? and not Cuba?Why he keeps writting about the greatness of Morales?Because he can do it in this country, in Cuba or Venezuela he would not be permited."
3,for the Dean Smith completist,"The authorized biography, written in 1980 and updated in 1990. Not a bad book, summarizes Smith's life and contains a number of testimonial's by former players, including an introduction by Michael Jordan. Not as detailed as Smith's own recent memoir nor as revealing as Art Chansky's book, really only for the dedicated Dean Smith fan."
4,A heroic story of woman empowerment,"The Eye of the Stallion is a heroic story of determination, woman empowerment and freedom of choice. I would recommend this book to young ladies in high school and college."
4,Great Game,"Disc is in great condition, however since it is an older game, it runs a little slow at times and freezes a few times, too. The freezing gets frustrating if you're playing for lengthy periods of time, but it's really not that bad."
3,"A bit predictable, not as good as later books in the series","Clearly this was an earlier novel, and thankfully she's gotten better with age. I guessed the ending as soon as I read the murder scene, including the subplot secrets. I might have to take a break from this series for a little while until it seems fresh again.For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal."
4,Cheesy but necessary,"As I stated, it's cheesy, but as a Ram fan, it's a must have for me. Makes those late night toilet trips a little more tolerable.GO RAMS!"
1,Worst computer,"This the worst and most expensive computer I ever had. Yes it is slick and that is the reason I bought it. But it is slow. It takes 5 minutes (300 seconds not 90) to boot. Everything (Photoshop, Streets and Trips, etc.) is slow and Vista is cumbersome. Get another brand with XP pre-installed, or install XP on the Vaio : http://forum.notebookreview.com/showthread.php?t=117070"
1,Clark doesn't let viewers enjoy the film with his overpowering narrative.,IT WAS A DISSAPOINTMENT FOR ME AND MY WIFE TO BUY THIS FILM. DIRECTOR BOB CLARK OVERPOWERING AND CONSTANT NARRATIVE SPOILS THE WHOLE FILM FOR PEOPLE THAT ONLY WANT TO ENJOY THE FILM AND THE SUPERB ACTORS. I DON'T RECOMMEND HOLMES'S FANS TO BUY IT.
4,A Delightful Pair,"By ""Pair,"" I mean Plummer and Mason, quite different from Rathbone and Bruce. Watching Watson fussing with the last pea on his plate, getting uncomfortable when a lady in the pub puts her hand on his thigh, and wondering what took Holmes so long to get him out of jail led much-needed humor to this dark movie. I liked the close-up of the Ripper's eyes near the beginning, and the tender way Mrs. Lee placed her hands on her husband's shoulders. It was fun watching Hemmings in a different role from when he was Modred, Richard Harris' King Arthur's son in Camelot, and Bujold playing so different a character from the one she played with Robert Shaw in Swashbuckler. I gave the movie 4 stars because Plummer came across as a little too emotional at times, but listening to the haunting melody he plays at the end, both sad and hopeful, is a treat to my ears."
4,Holmes vs. Ripper yarn,"Cool story. Well acted by good cast. Doyle fans will enjoy this treatment of the obvious ""missing"" story from the Holmes Canon.As a standard-length movie, the characters aren't quite as well developed as the much longer Michael Caine Ripper mini-series done by the Beeb, but it's well worth a look."
4,"W H O are the stars, Amazon?","Amazon has this odd habit of reducing the above the title stars to footnotes in their listings, and they've done it again with this picture. The stars are Christopher Plummer as Holmes, James Mason as Watson, and Donald Sutherland. Amazon's goofy alphabetizing of actors aside, this is a fascinating and well-made thriller, if exceedingly violent, and probably the best mash up of Holmes and the Ripper. It's being brought back to capitalize on the hoped for popularity of all things Holmes pending the release of the Robert Downey, Jr. version. We shall see."
4,"Better than ""From Hell"" : Read below","This is a great film, good plot, beautifuly filmed, and an intriguing idea.The film was remade (though without reference) as the Jonny Depp vehicle ""From Hell"", the ending is happier in the Depp film, but overll this film is much better, and the accents don't jar."
2,Not as good as the first...,"This game is not as good as the first one.The first one was alotsimpler to useand easier to navigate.Like the boat you ride around in is hard to control.Unlike the first one,you can'tskip the long speecches people make.I give it an extra star though because the graphics are quite beautiful."
3,Carly's Christmas So So So,"I love Carly, but I miss the pop sound, of some of her earlierworks, This seems very folky, and sometimes I wish morecare was given to the vocals and backround music, It doesn'tseem to have much in the way of a Christmas feel, alsoAs Carly gets older, do you sense her songs are gettingslower and slower, Still she sounds good, I just wishfor the future a more sonically fluid Carly,"
3,Would have benefited from studio recording,"In the liner notes, Carly Simon discusses how the album was recorded in a hotel room in LA during January 2002. She adds how the basic tapes were produced, mastered and ultimately released over the ensuing nine months. I am normally a devoted fan of Carly Simon, but the sound quality of this album suffers from the original sessions having been recorded on a notebook computer. No amount of remastering could overcome the flawed basic tracks. This album would have benefited from studio recording, which may have precluded some of the harshness that is readily apparent in first listening. Carly, please, rerecord this album. We miss your ""signature"" quality sound. And shame on Rhino for passing this off on the public at full price!"
2,plastic threads strip out,"I liked the idea of a composite bodied air tool thinking maybe it would not get so cold after extended usage, but I didn't get a chance to use it enough to tell a difference, unfortunately the air adapter that comes threaded and installed from the factory is weak because of the plastic and came apart while using it. Don't waste your money."
4,REALLY CLASSY FAN,"We saw several versions of this fan from different companies so we took a chance on this one knowing Hunter was a good brand. Like all our other Hunter fans...this one did not disappoint. It is beautiful and works flawlessly. Took about 90 minutes to install (we had to re-cut a hole in the ceiling) otherwise it probably would take 30 minutes. We are very pleased and ""cool""."
1,Manfacture & Amazon LIED!! It is NOT Made by Ruger !!,"This Muzzle Brake comes in NuSTAR packaging.It was listed on Amazon.com as being by Ruger!It is NOT a Ruger Manufactured Item!The setscrew supplied was made out of SOFT metal.The Allen Head stripped out while trying to tighten it.I fixed this by re-tapping the hole to 8-32 (Was a BS Metric size).I replaced the inferior cone point setscrew with a hardened 8-32 1/16""long cup point one.Summery:Product was NOT made by Ruger.After re-tapping & replacing the inferior setscrew the product now fits properly & works properly.The product fit to the muzzle of the weapon is fine, But is a hassle if tried to use as bought!"
4,Bloke in a dress,"Eddie is one of the funniest comedians on the planet. The way he dances from one bit to the next does make him a bit hard to follow. If you listen carefully though, you will be rewarded with some of the best stand up in the world."
2,HARDLY eddie's best,"stick with Dressed to Kill and Glorious, because next to those Circle is hackneyed, repetitive and ... flat. dont get me wrong, i love eddie, he's fabulous, but if you're buying his shows, skip this one. i wish i had."
5,Excellent album,"Fans of British humor will like this especially. Even if you're not its still funny, eclectic irreverent humor."
3,Some good points among the fluff,"If you want to end a relationship, do it in person, plan what you will say, and do it. Good, sound advice for women and men alike. Now you don't have to read the book. But you should read it anyway since most people have probably never ended a relationship cleanly and the book is fairly amusing. Especially enjoyed the typing of men (Cling-on, Tin Man, etc.)."
1,Utter drivel,sounds like neither of the authors have had any experienceing in dumping guys. Yawned my way through this piece of nonsense...
5,Thanks for being great!,"I have never been so impressed with any service, until now!Purchasing from Marketspice was a delightful experience! I ordered their great tea, and just two days later received my package, just as fresh as promised!! The lovely ladies and gentlemen at Marketspice should be so very proud of themselves for the great service and attention they have given to their customers for so many years! Great job!! Keep up the EXCELLENT and VERY impressive work!"
1,Great Smell - Weak Tea,"I love the flavor that permeates the air when this tea is brewing, but unfortunately the aroma oversells the taste. I don't know if it is the bags or the amount of tea in the bags, but I can not get a strong cup of tea from the tea bag.Both the cinnamon-orange and the northwest breakfast tea smell so great, it is a shame that they don't taste as good."
3,Marketspice Cinnamon-Orange,Nice quality tea. Quite strong and spicy. One bag will flavor a lot of hot water before losing the flavor. Recommended if you like sweet and spicy.
4,I Dont Buy it for the Taste...,"It doesnt taste great to me, but i bought it originally to help the osteoarthritis in both my knees. The pain is awful, and no pain killers help. I dont want to take a pill that has more side effects than is worth it. I do believe this juice is helping, but i also drink sour cherry juice. I drink the Mangosteen juice ice cold everyday, from a shot glass. You are much better off with this 100% juice than the combos and their sales pitches. You can tell this is the real thing. I am on my 4th bottle or so, i'd say. The only reason i didnt give it a 5 is because like i said, it tastes crappy. But it's for your health, after all."
2,Designs minus beauty,"This book contains a great deal of visual information on clothing throughout the world and through the ages. It makes a good reference. However, unlike Racinet's dazzling Historical Encyclopedia of Costumes, it is not beautiful. The images are functional, but not inspirational."
3,What About Mental Fitness?,"Whenever I read books like this, it makes me think again that doctor's just don't get it - they ignore the ""big picture"" of their patient's health and focus on treating symptoms with just Western medicine. That's their business, of course. It's up to consumers to get educated, on that I agree. We can do a lot by keeping physically fit, but what about mental fitness? Whoever talks about that? We are an aging population and more needs to be done to prevent memory loss, etc. Rather than obsolete books, I find services like Agogus.com much more ""up"" on the holistic perspective."
1,Makeover Book,"I couldn't even read this book. By the time I figured out my ""real age"" I was so old, I couldn't even conceive of how on earth to improve it."
5,Great combo of Biography and Social History,"This is much more than a discussion of Jefferson and his home. Interwoven throughout the narrative are threads of colonial life. Slavery, Jefferson's personal relationships, the lower class white aristsans of Monticello are all discussed in detail. This makes the book a good biography, and a great social history."
3,"fun, but really big","I guess I should have looked more carefully at the dimensions before ordering, but be aware that this product is quite large. Too big to fit in a purse/ bag to take anywhere. I thought it would be something I could take when we had to wait somewhere or to keep the kids quiet at church, but it is just really too big to travel."
2,Bore me to Death,"I read ""Lady Sings the Blues"" and loved it, but once I found out that it was ghost written, I decided to find a farely accurate bio of the great Lady Day. This had the best reviews on Amazon.com, so I borrowed it from the library. Lucky for me. This book was long winded, dry, and boring. It read like a thesis paper. The quotes and anecdotes were misplaced and some had nothing to do with the passage it was featured in. Some of the stories were like listening to your Grandfather tell some gawd-aweful long story that doesn't have a single narrative. I think Clarke couldn't decide if he was writing about the times or Billy Holiday. Granted he mentioned everything under the sun to give the reader as sense of the times and culture, but there was little devoted to Billy per se. Great research, but it needed a better editor. My search continues..."
1,It didnt work,"I opened the package and put the bats that came with the product, it didn't work...then i try some other battery and didn't work either...so over all i rate this product as a piece of junk...don't buy it."
3,One switch!,"I thought their would be 2 switches on this unit, one for the flashlight, and one for the laser, well their is only one switch that operates both modes of light. Other than that it seems to have a good brightness in the flashlight mode which is main reason why I purchased it. I'm not shure of the durability for I just recieved it a week ago."
4,Laser Pointer -Flashlight,"The laser pointer flashlights arrived quickly and were exactly what I was hoping for. Good quality. I was concerned the flashlight wouldn't be bright enough, but am very happy with it."
3,Archetype Casino Chips,"I have a 10 chip sample of the Archetypes. I like them but I don't love them. They have a good weight and feel to them and decent sound when riffling a stack of them. But being a ceramic chip, the sound is definitely not the same as the clack that a good clay chip makes. Also, they're brittle. The company says that they're virtually indestructible, but they're far from it. If you drop one onto any hard surface like a tile floor, they will chip the edges very easily leaving you with chipped chips. Oh, and the colors fade on the edges just from normal use. I got the sample to see if I'd like to purchase a 500 chip set, and while I like them, for me to spend over $500 on the set, I'd have to love them and I don't. They are a great casino quality chip but, at over $1 each I just don't think they're better than the clay ones...Just my two cents."
3,Not necessarily worth the import.,"This is quite possibly the weakest link in the series of singles from Monster. First, it was only released outside of the U.S. so if you live here, like me, you will have to import this disc if you wish to own it. And for what you get, that may or may not necessarily be a wise thing to do. We have all heard Whats the Frequency Kenneth? and Bang and Blame many times, and the live versions are pretty much similar to the studio ones. They are good songs, but there is nothing too new here. Basically the only saving grace about this single is the version of I Don't Sleep, I Dream which I am a fan of. Again it is nothing special or new, but it is good enough to (maybe) warrant importing. Get the other singles first, and if you really like them, maybe you should invest in this one too."
4,Interesting...,"""Tongue"", originally from ""Monster"", is a great song, although very different. Micheal Stipe sings this in a very high-pitched voice. It starts and finishes sweet, but sour lyrics and a callous guitar solo make it a near perfect balance."
1,Thar She Blows,My sprinkler hose exploded the first time I used it. It was unable to withstand the water pressure supplied by the city I live in.
2,Not enough pressure,"When you have connected it to the mioan faucet, the pressure in the holes at the beginning is very high that it results in a shower-like throw, whereas at the end, there is not enough pressure to even allow water to soak out. 50' is too much for this design. 25' would work like it is supposed to."
5,More than just 'Christian' music...it's good music,"I told friends that I could not stand Christian music. It all seems to be either acoustic guitar ramblings or rock bands trying really really hard to be another band with the words 'Jesus' tossed in for good measure.A friend lent me his copy of this CD and I can say that I have officially changed my mind about Christian music. Excellent song writing. Album production that is clean and professional. Mark's voice can sound a bit like Dennis DeYoung from Styx, but his songs are 10 times better. Just a delightful album. Plain and simple.Sick of the usual Christian music? Buy this and be refreshed."
4,Good,The tone of this discussion alone makes it worth reading if interested in this subject. They debate at a high level without compromising either their position or the charity Christians are to have.
3,it's got a sense of humor,"This album is quirky, fun music. No, it's not perfect, but it's taking risks and and makes good on most of them. I'm pretty sure it doesn't sound anything like any other recording you own, and that should be a good enough reason to check it out."
2,Awful or wonderful? Depends what you are looking for,"I was recommended this author by a friend, who did warn me that it's mindless ""chick lit"". Well it was. Trouble is that it's not very well written, neither plot nor grammar wise. Vicenzi has the idea of a plot, but cannot get description or characters across. She makes long lists of trade names or buildings rather than describing a shop, house, or street. To me the characters served the plot rather than driving it. There were moral dilemmas but no real agonizing over them that drew you in to agonizing too. And I found this book to have several utterly ridiculous flaws in the plot, made simply to drive the story. I like escapism and what I'd call ""airplane books"" - those you choose to read on an airplane flight as they don't demand a lot of attention. The trouble is this book is escapist and mindless but not well written or fun to read, just a bit of a drag really."
3,"Entertaining, fast-reading chick lit","I purchased this book while at the beach. While it seemed much too thick to be considered beach reading, the write-up on the back of the book enticed me. I compare this book to a soap opera, albeit a good one. I do not mean this as a negetive...quite the opposite. Just to let you know what to expect: well written chick lit. You can sit and read 5 pages or 30 pages and feel like you've taken something away. However, once you're done with the book, I'd be surprised if any deep thoughts lingered. Not sure if I'd pick up another Vicenzi novel, but would rec this one. And in fact have already passed it on to a friend headed to the beach!"
3,good but not her best,"I have read 4 of Penny Vincenzi's titles and this one is not the best. She is a great writer of this genre, hard to put down modern women's fiction but this one drags on at the end to not much effect. The last third could have used a good paring down and the ending is disappointing. That said, it held my attention for most of it and as always with her books I stayed up way too late reading it. I do love her books and the Englishness of the settings. She could have done more with wrapping this one up. Try Absolute Scandal for Vincenzi in top form."
3,the recording,"being a giant fan l found the recording really bad,worse than that,the band sounded tight but it sounds like it was recorded on a phone,the sound is one of the worst bootlegs Ive ever heard.the album is not for introducing anyone to the band.this album is for die hard fan's only, sad really. macca."
4,new life for an old IPAQ,Good battery life as long as you don't get too happy with wireless and bluetooth. I don't bother with a smart phone and paper organizers are bulky so I still use this pda every day.
4,Good early hodgepodge,"As the other reviewers have noted, this is good, solid early Wodehouse. It's an unusual combination of his early genre mixing and later polished fluff. There's a good thriller (of the ""brave English ex-public school-boy thrust into adventure"" sub-genre) and a quite serious romance in here (whose heroine shares my last name, by coincidence I hope), as well as a public school story of the type that began his career."
4,The Inimitable Wodehouse,"However happy your mood, reading a Wodehouse book will turn it up a notch. The early Wodehouse novels are no exception. ""The Little Nugget"" is funny, exciting, and romantic. It doesn't have as many memorable lines as a Jeeves and Wooster story, but it's definitely worth reading and is very interesting to those of us who have already read and re-read ""The Inimitable Jeeves."""
2,Does Not Work On My Plaster Walls,"My house was built in the 1950s and the interior walls are covered in plaster not dry wall. This stuff is as hard as rock and even small pictures take substantial nails as the nail has to be strong enough to survive the pounding. Double sided mounting tape seemed like a great idea.The trial was made with a framed picture weighing about eight ounces. Tape was placed across the back of the frame at the top and another strip at the bottom. The picture was pressed into place above a peg board of hooks, which supported the weight of the picture. All the tape had to do was to hold on.The picture stayed in place about 36 hours and then fell down with a clatter. I note two things that partially excuse this: the plaster wall is rough with a gritty texture and the picture's placement was near a heat vent. This mounting tape held on longer than any similar product, but that isn't saying much."
5,Holds like glue,"I create presentation boards for design presentations and I often find myself needing to affix a piece of marble, tile or carpet to the board. Glue doesn't hold and regular tape is a joke. Scotch mounting tape, however, does the job. Normally if I affix a piece of marble it has fallen off of the board by the end of the day - I have marble still sticking to the board weeks later and no signs of letting go. This tape is amazing and, though I can't say for sure, it truly seems to be a permanent tape. Highly recommended."
4,Pretty Impressive,"The other day I needed to mount a paper towel holder in my kitchen. I have had a hard time in the past trying to drill into our kitchen cupboards, so I used this tape instead. I was only able to use 2 small pieces about 1 inch each in length. It has now been up all week! I am impressed. Most of the time I usually thing that tape is just tape and I've had mixed experiences with tape of this type. But, with this tape I am pleased!"
2,Don't Let The Title Fool You,"Brutal is quite possibly one of the worst slasher movies out there, mainly because for most of its running time it forgets that it's a dumb slasher movie. It takes itself too seriously and focuses too much of its time on an adulterous couple, and on shoddy detective work.B-movie legends Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator) and Michael Berryman (The Hills Have Eyes; The Devils Rejects) both star, but they turn in disappointing performances. Perhaps its because both of their characters are so badly written.However, Brutal does have a few bloody good deaths, and I've seen worse. So I'm going to be nice and give it two stars."
3,Could have been worse,I found the performances by Jeffry Combes and Michael Berryman to be quite refreshing and unlike their previous roles. The plot and other acting did leave something to be desired. I liked the whole flower/garden tool motif for for a slasher-like film amusing.
1,Poor quality engine. Died after a month.,I bought this edger from a local retailer and had it about a month when it started cutting out and sputtering for no reason. It refused to start at all shortly thereafter. There are lots of reports that this edger does not do well with ethanol fuel. Ours is 10% ethanol which is supposed to work according to the manufacturer's recommendation. I'd stay away from this one.
1,AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!,I bought this unit less than 3 months ago and now it won't start. I've tried everything I could think of and brought it to a repair center and they want $150 to repair it! They say the carb is shot and needs to be replaced. I've only used pure (no ethanol) gas so I don't know how that happened. I think I'll save my money and throw this thing in the trash!
1,Junk,"Ever since Troy-Bilt sold out to the same company that makes Yard Machines and MTD junk their name has been in the toilet, and with good reason.If you want the quality Troy-Bilt used to be known for, go buy a McLane or Little Wonder edger. Yes, you will pay more. If you are wealthy, buy a Tanaka and be happy for the rest of your life.On the plus side, any of the aforementioned brands have this advantage over the Troy-Bilt: you won't have them out on your front sidewalk with a ""free"" sign on them next season."
5,Very very funny,"We found this retelling of the three little pigs to be completely enjoyable. It sneaks in comparatives and superlatives and does a great job reinforcing those concepts, and there's a twist at the end of the story, when the pigs end up marrying the antagonists, that we absolutely howled with laughter about. What a great story book."
4,A fascinating read,"I initially heard about this book via the New York Radio Message Board & its webmaster Allan Sniffen-Based on what he had to say,I decided to go out & buy a copy for myself-I'm glad I did-This is a terrific book-Richard Neer chronicles his career from the late 1960's when he worked for a Long Island,NY station called WLIR to the heritage rock station WNEW-FM in NYC,where he stayed from 1971-1999-Neer recounts the events that led to WNEW's demise as a rock station in 1999-Apparently,he wasn't thrilled that it changed formats to talk-In the two & a half years since NEW-FM became a talk station,their ratings have been abysmal,to say the least-Anyway,Neer has done a thorough job here-This is a book,which should not only be read by those in the industry,but for people like myself,who love listening to the radio."
1,Review for Don Quijote ISBN 849764476X,"Don't buy this edition. The binding is horrible. I no sooner opened this book, BRAND NEW, than it began falling apart."
4,This is mind blowing - Watch with an open mind,"See & hear about the biggest news story in history that the major networks neglected to tell us about. Billy Meire has been given the opportunity to take the clearest pictures ever seen. There is also 8mm film , sound recordings & metal samples that where studied & analyzed by IBM.(found to have been created with a cold fusion process not yet possible on Earth). This video Should have had a bigger budget(but they are strictly NON-PROFIT). The info is REALLY AMAZING NONE THE LESS. If what happened to Mr. Meire actually happened to you what do you think people would think ?? Yet there is lots of info & evidence in this video that is here to see. This story should not be dismissed so easily by major networks. I STRONGLY RECOMEND THIS FILM."
4,Not Thrown Out of a Bar - This Time,"Ron was a bit overdue to introduce some new material, and does a histerical job of it! That fantastic scotch-sippin, grinnin comedy that we've all come to love is continued in lots of new and entertaining tales of funny family members and just plain old everyday stupid. I loved it! It even made my wife laugh right out loud - and she doesn't think anything is funny."
4,dense and useful,"This was a very hefty book which presented a wide number and variety of techniques used in industrial organization. There was a lot of information crammed into this book. There were some good real-world examples to illustrate their points throughout the text. They were able to present both the verbal concepts as well as the mathematical models together. The graphs were numerous and useful. Math presented within the text was not as easy to follow intuitively. Concrete examples were covered in class instead.Because of how much material this book covers, I would not consider it fun leisure reading for most, but would recommend it for classes, or at least some supplemental reading if you want to apply the models.Granted, I have not seen other books on industrial organization, but I thought this was a pretty good book on its own."
1,didn't work,"It simply didn't work for me. I am in Washington DC area and not sure if it was because the FM signals are too jammed. But it just didn't work. After I tried many times, I gave up. Also too bad, it was after 30 days so I couldn't return."
5,Works Surprisingly Well,"I have had bad experiences with both the Coby brand and FM transmitters in general over the years. This one, however, exceeded my expectations and has worked extremely well since I bought it about 5 months ago. I have used it both in NJ, Brooklyn and Long Island. It does a great job at masking other FM stations and plays clearly through my radio."
2,Apparently Cigarette Lighters only,This device only works with cigarette lighters and not 12-volt power points (such as in Toyota vehicles). I tried it in a Highlander with both a power point and a cigarette lighter port. It works in the cigarette lighter port but not the 12-volt power point. The product does not list any technical specifications.I was however able to contact their support (on a Saturday no less!). They had no solutions however. He suggested I write their support to see if they had any answers...
2,Gotha is great but this book isn't,To clarify:Gotha's story books along with his drawings are absolutely wonderful. I recommend any of his books except this one.This book isn't really part of the Janice series. As another person posted (and I wish I had read the reviews more closely) this book is only a sampling of Gotha's drawings that are related to the Janice series. In my opinion it's not worth the cost.Stick with his other great works.
3,Modern harpsichord repertoire,"This is a great recording of expertly played music. Funaro plays a selection of modern harpsichord work, which is what the CD suggests if you look closely, but I noticed that Amazon has it classified with classical and baroque music, and that is certainly not true. Such expectations would lead to disappointment with a CD that, if approached on its own terms, is quite good."
4,Great for the home garage guru!,"Great compressor strong enough to run most anything the home garage guy may encounter. Surprised to see this unit is still available for purchase (I bought it back in 2006). It has appreciated more than most stocks from around 2006 (I spent less than three hundred for it). I have had to replace the pressure sensor (would not auto-shut off) but it was in stock at a local distributor and cost $33. Not so big that it's cumbersome to roll around to where you need it but not too small to not be able to run sanders and other high consumption tools, just right."
1,Pathetic Chinese garbage,"Gilmour used to make these in the USA from what I understood, but these are Chinese and they are garbage. I just spent an hour pruning tomato plants and I may as well have just broken off the branches with my fingers rather than use this thing. Not only is it dull, but the bypass blade is misaligned leaving too much of a gap in the cutting action. All it does is partially break the branch and shred it. Maybe all the brands are Chinese at this point and all you can do is go for a low priced one like this. But if you can find a higher quality one for more money, do it. This is not worth the frustration and damaged plants."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I bought this CD primarily for the title cut; unfortunately the tune was not the one I was expecting, although it was very pleasant. Also was expecting the full mixed choir of St. Paul's, not just the trebles. Thought the selections were a bit hackneyed, and some of the arrangements over-the-top and schmaltzy. Overall it was a pleasant enough disc, but I was glad I paid so little for it."
1,Failed after 2 months,"Summary: My unit failed after 2 months and it is not a genuine Dell charger.I bought this to replace my original Dell charger. A little over 2 months later, it's dead. When it worked, it would really overheat. As the previous reviewers stated, this is not a Dell charger even though it is advertised as such. It still might be worth buying if the charger lifetime vs replacement cost is better than Dell chargers. For me, this was not the case, and I will be spending the extra money for a Dell-brand charger."
1,No as Pictured / Described,"The company that shipped me this piece did not ship a genuine Dell AC Adapter.It felt cheap, it looked cheap, and no longer worked after two weeks of sitting on my office desk.Ensure you product is genuine before ordering."
1,worked for short time... very hot always,"product worked for almost 6 months with me not using it very often, maybe a hour if that a day. also was very, very hot from day one. i would take breaks of having it plugged into my dell as i was afraid it was going to set something on fire. cheap but not worth heat and replacement costs."
1,A Picture Book,"SInce its called images of baseball, maybe I should have expected this, but the book is basicall just pictures of players with a paragraph next to the picture."
2,Healthy?,"I bought this book thinking that it would provide low fat recipes. I found only a few that were below 20 grams of fat! If you are looking for a lowfat cookbook, I don't suggest this one."
3,Adapter please,"It would have been nice to know ahead of time that a gutter adapter was needed to use this . Can't use it without it, it should be included. It's a drain pipe, works fine after you get the adapter."
3,Doesn't look like it's going to work for me,"The drain pipe was a little difficult to stretch out to its entire length, but I am a 65 year old grandma and I could do it with a little effort. There are two problems for me... I did buy the adapter and it seemed really like a tight fit on the downspout, but during the wind and rain last night, it came off. The other problem involves the pipe itself, it is hard for me to manipulate it so it will slant down all the way to the end. We do get freezing temperatures and snow and I'm afraid the water that collects inside will freeze and cause problems. I gave it 3 stars because I still hope to work out some things, but it is clumsy for me to work with and don't know if it is going to be worth it."
5,This book is awesome,very well wrote the book really touches on this ladies life and her living conditions very sad but very touching story
5,Good Book from Amazon,I have read this book and found it well written and so very sad. Some of these true crime books break your heart but it's my favorite thing to read. All though it happened a very long time ago I just like knowing why people do the things that they do. I think it gives us all a better understand of people.
5,Great product,Great product. Lasts a long time even when doing heavy duty printing.I've had this printer for 7 years and it's just as good today as it was on day one.
3,Lackluster,"This book has very little to do directly with animation.Plenty of the drawing principles explained are quite valuable to an animator. Rules of proportion, anatomy, perspective, etc... that are the foundation of most any form of drawing, This book is a decent primer in these principles, although there are plenty of other books that cover them better.But if you thought you were going to learn the about drawing in the manner & style of 2D animation, think again. Clean-up style linework is only covered briefly and most of the examples of it aren't that great. Most of the art in this book is too rough to be suitable for animation, which is fine for life drawings, but the rest can be little more than conceptual work, which can come from any style of art, really. There's not enough structure taught to create usable artwork for characters, backgrounds or even layouts for animation.There's definitely things you can learn from this book, but you're better off finding them somewhere else."
2,"I am sorry, but the French just irritate me","Perhaps it is because I purchased this book in an audio format; I found it very difficult to listen to and lost interest. Yes, this is supposed to be Mark Twains masterpiece, but, at least to this reviewer, it does not even come close the Twains masterpiece Huckleberry Finn.Perhaps it I read this book before September 11th, I would had fared better. But the French have lost their soul. Even though in Joan we find a Frenchman (or should I say, a French woman) who has integrity and is willing to fight and die for a righteous cause, all what the French do now is irritate me."
5,Best book I have ever read!,"Mark Twain's Joan of Arc is the best book I have ever read. It is remarkable to think that this young, uneducated teenager had the courage to convince the king to give her an army to save her country. The book is especially interesting, given Twain's usual disdain for religion."
5,good reference,I really enjoy using this for my devotional time and cross reference. I would highly recommend buying it. It has given me a better understanding of what was written.
4,good translation,"Unless one is using the original Greek, which I don't, one should try to have a few translations at hand. This is one I fully recommend having, because it will bring out the inherent Jewishness that is already in the text. This is long overlooked, and it is great that this translation exists. One should be warned that it is only one translator, so bias can more easily creep into the translation. But for what it does, it does well. I would not use it as my sole New Testament, but I would and do use it. I especially love reading the four gospels in this translation."
4,Spiritually insightful but too much emphasis on the Cold War,"Kengor's book is well reseached and provides tremendous insight into Reagan's faith. His emphasis on the Cold War is overdone. At points, I thought I was reading a book about the Cold War instead of one about Reagan's faith. He could have eliminated 50 pages of Reagan's passion to end the Cold War and the reader would have still understood Kengor's points and the magnitude of this issue. Finally, the book is written more like a textbook as opposed to a biography, but still a must read for any Reagan fan."
1,Not built to last,"I have had this storage tote for two weeks and it is already breaking. It looks nice and sturdy when you get it, but after it comes apart you can see it is poorly made. The straps are continuous down one side, across the bottom, and up the other side. At the top on each side the ends are glued (not sewn) and then tucked in where they can't be seen. This tote is not built to last."
2,One readers delight is another readers disappointment!,"I am a LMcKenna fan. She has written some wonderful books. This however isn't one of them. However if you like strong, stamp out men type women, you'll like the secondary characters, apache pilots, ""Snake"" and ""Wild Woman"" (They define the word testosterone!)The ""heroine"", and I use this term loosely is a weak, afraid of her own shadow type compared to them. And the hero, Gus, is gushy about accepting women as his superiors....He shows too much estrogen for me.Half way thru the book, I tossed it. Enough was more than enough. Sorry Lindsay."
1,Too broad of a spectrum,"I have bought and read almost all of the books in this series and definitely this is the one that satisfied me the least. In trying to squeeze too many cultures living in too broad of a time frame in just one regular sized book, the reader is just confused on the relation between the choices of cultures displayed. Most of the individual sections are just too short to show the coinage and much less the history of these peoples. One should approach this book as a long, long magazine article that presents some non classical cultures and just that. It is not even a book, as the others in the series are, that entices you to look deeper into the bibliography and that at least gives you the 'big picture'. This book only succeeds in confusing and making the coinage of those already almost unknown cultures a little bit more obscure."
5,FLYING MACHINE,"The most beautiful part of the movie is when Jack & Rose are standing on the real of the boat adn Rose says:""I'm flying, Jack, I really am"". And than Jack sings:""come Josephine, in your flying machine,..."". .... And than they are kissing!"
1,would be good if I could hear it,"I was really looking forward to this - put it on, leaned back, and turned the volume up full because the sound was so soft....and it got softer and softer.... until I couldn't hear it at all. So I'm thinking it was defective and I should send it back."
4,"Buy for ""I Against I "", Forget 100th Window","This single is worth getting just for I Against I alone. Truly inspiring and totally crushes anything on 100th Window. Period. Being a true Massive Attack fan from way back, I tried and tried to get into 100th Window but found it to be trying too hard and lost in its attempt at being ""different"". I Against I (featuring another incredible peformance by Mos Def) has all the qualities that make a Massive Attack track: production, drive, vision, and hunger. Special Cases is simply alright. Massive Attack has set the bar that unfortunately can work against them. I love that they challenge my listening but unfortunately 100th Window, despite its attention to detail, is so insular in its views that it needs to open up and share its vision with the world.Buy this single for I Against I and the video, forget 100th Window, and wait (in hope) for their next album."
3,Great for the money but not in the field,"I have received really good sound quality for the money in the past , but recently the clamp of the mike came a part without my knowledge, this created a terrible humming sound when recording or when that part of the mike was touched. For the money, it is a really nice sounding lavalier, but it doesn't hold up well in the field. I would actually give it a 3+ because the sound is good when the clamp is in place, just remember to bring a headphone to your shoot, that is the big mistake I made."
4,Return to Zork has my vote!,"I love this game! My best friend and I played it together, and we had so much fun trying to figure out the different puzzles and stuff. It has good graphics and haunting music, and it didn't let us down. I only wish more of the games were available from amazon, I'd buy them in a heartbeat!!!"
5,Great Adventure Game,"This is THE game for all adventure game lovers! It's a very old game so the graphics aren't great, but it's a ton of fun. The puzzles in the game range from easy to extremely difficult but thanks to the internet, the hard ones can be solved :)I definitely recommend this game, as well as all other games in the Zork series (though the first three are text based so i don't personally enjoy them too much)"
5,Truly a hero's story,"They are sometimes called ""The Silent Option."" They are the ""elite of the elite."" They are the US Navy SEALs, and Bob Gormly may be the best of this group of men already known as ""the best of the best.""COMBAT SWIMMER is more than just the memoir of one man's combat experiences. It is a fascinating look inside the head of one of America's REAL heroes."
1,Poor Quality - Look elsewhere,"I have several issues with this case. First off, the color is nothing like the pictures. The yellow is a pale, ugly, and even translucent in some places. The plastic has lots of casting marks that need to be removed as well. The outer shell is flimsy and the holes don't line up with the buttons or the pogo pin pads for the docking station. When I put it on the power button kept getting pressed... and no matter how many times I adjusted the same thing happened. Overall I thought this thing was terrible and returned it. Spend the extra $2 and get an OtterBox. I should have known when the item title is a whole paragraph and tries to explain how awesome it is. Total waste of money... move along."
3,Pretty Good Early Cotton,"This album is a nice look at Cotton during his early years of solo recording. It takes the five songs Cotton contributed to ""Chicago The Blues Today!"" vol. 2 and adds the entirety of ""Cut You Loose"" (thus rendering the old record obselete) plus a re-cut of ""Next Time You See Me."" Overall its a good record, but it lacks the driving energy Cotton would develop in the next decade. There is also a marked lack of harp lines which detracted from my enjoyment of the CD (he is, after all, one of the masters of the instrument). The material is good, but with the exception of ""Cotton Crop Blues"" and ""Rocket 88"" nothing truly spectacular occurs. Still, this makes for a fine introduction to some early Cotton material."
3,James Cotton,I bought the CD to learn to play the harmonica riffs for only one song. I liked that one song very much but the other songs were just OK in my opinion. It is not like I am a blues critic.
1,Think before you market (Where's the zero rating?),"As a teacher and a parent of an eight year old who would like this item (and whose daughter happens to fall within the company's recommended age level) I am appalled at the lack of thought and responsibility that went into the production of the music that accompanies this product. As sickly sweet and boring (to adults) that some children's music can seem, suggestive lyrics are not appropriate or appreciated by this parent. On top of that, carcinogenic substances don't belong on items intended to be touched by human beings, especially ones that are still developing. This is one item that will not end up under our tree."
2,Not happy with the toaster,"I purchased this toaster based on the reviews I read. I like that I can select settings for toast, bagels, warm, and frozen. The temp on it runs hot so even at the middle setting my toast and bagels burn."
4,Oster product comments,"Wife has an Oster blender and liked the product. The Oster toaster was purchased because of the historical experience with the Oster product line. A decision factor for the toaster purchase was, my wife's selection of the color. The color matches blender. The toaster replaces a toaster that broke after many years of service. The replacement Oster toaster has features that were not available with the earlier toaster model."
2,Lasted all of a year,"This toaster looks great but after about 10 months, it started toasting inconsistently. Now, all it does is burn our toast, no matter what the setting. Really quite frustrating, but it is another example of ""you get what you pay for."" I would not recommend this toaster to anyone."
2,Toaster or Burner?,"I have this toaster in a copper color. It does not toast consistently, either under-toasting or burning, even if it's on the same ""number"". Sometimes it toasts on one side, but not the other. I just want toasted bread and I don't want to pay $300 for a Dualit, is that asking too much?!?"
4,Best thing since sliced bread...(sorry!),"Had to say that. This toaster does a good job, I especially like the bagel setting which toasts a bagel to a crispy perfection. And it is beautiful on my counter. The shinny red looks like a candy apple finish. Very classy and makes you smile in the morning."
5,"Whoever has the Rights, Please Re-Print this Book!","I too loved this book. I gave it away decades ago, to friends after they had a child; and since then, I've wished I had the book back at least ten times over to give to other friends. The illustrations especially enthralled me - the expressiveness of the animals' faces, and the trip to India - so exotic!Surely someone has the rights to this book; let them please share it again!"
5,Excellent for everyone interested in marine genetics,"The topics in the book are really broad in their treatment. Lots of population genetics, zoology and molecular ecology. I recommend this book. Very worthy."
3,Good power storage - not sure about the coverage area,"After I changed my battery, my headset performed much better. The battery life seems fine. However, I can now only go about 60-70' from the base. I used to be able to go about twice that far before the headset cut out. I don't quite understand why the new battery would affect that, but it did happen right after I changed the battery."
4,buy with caution for win7,"I love heretic. The only bad thing is that Raven software isn't keeping up fast enough with new computer OS's. Got it to work with XP by downloading the 1.06 patch. No luck so far with win 7, though some people have."
2,plz show more realistic pics,"None of the photos show that this is actually plug in, rather than battery operated. We don't have an outlet anywhere near our range top so I had expressly wanted battery op. Wish the photos had been more accurate!"
2,"Great, Product, Warranty Stinks","First of all, great product to use. Powerful, easy, everything you want. HOWEVER, mine broke after four months of use in our house. (Too late to return to Amazon). Nothing commercial, nothing harsh. The ""Limited Three Year Warranty"" requires that I send the unit back to Cuisinart along with $10.00 for ""handling."" When you figure all the cost involved, its just about as cheap to replace as to use the ""warranty"". I will be choosing another brand for replacement and hope that either their product is more durable or their warranty isn't as poor."
5,Excellent for baby food,"I read some reviews that gave me the impression this might not be helpful for blending baby food but I was pleasantly surprised with how handy it has been. It's not just for ""small"" jobs. I can easily blend 3 or more cups of food (apples, pears, broccoli, etc.) so far with no problem. I try to cook several batches of food all at once so this is really convenient for rinsing off and blending another type of food in another container, rather than washing out the big, bulky blender each time. Color is great, too. Pale pink as shown. Love it!!"
5,Cuisinart Turquoise smart stick from a lazy cook,"I read the reviews before I purchased it, which is why I picked this particular one. Also, I have had good luck with Cuisinart coffee-makers, so I thought it would be good to use a product I know. I find it easy to use, easy to clean and with no set up time. I typically use it for fruit and yogurt drinks, which are yummy. I was afraid that I would buy it and throw it in a drawer, finding it months later and wondering why I bought it. But, that is not the case. I had seen them used on a public television cooking program, using it in a pot saving washing extra items. I use it daily and cleanup is a snap. The price was excellent."
4,perfect hand blender,Love the Cuisinart CSB-76G hand blender. I make my smoothies several times a week and only need to wash the cup that comes with it and the immersion attachment. I purchased the green color. Go buy it.
3,"Great customer service, pieces won't stay latched, though","I'm on my third SmartStick, having returned it twice since purchasing it 6 months ago. It is truly guaranteed for a year, and Cuisinart makes it easy to return--even sending UPS to the house to pick up the broken item. You do have to come up with packing material, though, so save the boxes. The same thing broke twice: the latch stopped working so the two pieces wouldn't latch together after two or three uses. My third SmartStick (second replacement) was just delivered today, and I'm going to try something different this time. Even though the instructions say the blending shaft (not the motor housing) can be put into the diswasher, I'm not going to do that. Will wash the blending shaft by hand. Suspect that the dishwasher might have driven water into the shaft latch and that caused the issue. Fingers crossed this doesn't break again. I like the product when it works."
5,Cuisinart Smartstick,Love it. I use it almost every morning to make my breakfast smoothie. I haven't tried blending anything more substantial than a banana but I'm sure it will be able to handle bulkier foods.
5,I LOVE mine!,"This is one of the best purchases I have made in a long time. Quicker and easier than a full-sized blender. Saves SO much time in the morning when I make my protein powder, kale and frozen fruit smoothies!"
5,I'm loving this!,I don't have a lot of counter/kitchen space so I wanted something small (i.e. not a blender) and this seemed to have good reviews. I'm not disappointed at all! I've made some soups that were pureed to perfection with minimal effort and I've made a smoothie just about every day since receiving it. I don't use ice in the smooothies just frozen fruit and some yogurt and it handles it perfectly.I will say that I wish the depth of the bottom to where the blade is wasn't so deep. This comes into play when using it in soup and if your pan is too shallow or your soup not high enough then you do get a bit of splatter. To control this I have just used a smaller pan so the liquid is higher. Also - a helpful tip for cleaning. When you are done fill up the 2 cup beaker half way with some dish soap and hot water and then just pulse the blender a few times. The blade is all clean and you just have to rinse it. SUPER EASY!
5,Kitchen Staple,"I'm not quite sure how I've lived so long without one. I received one for my birthday and used it over a dozen times throughout the winter for my soups. Normally I would have used the blender but with the immersion blender, it was seamless, there was no mess and I had the same if not better results. Cleaning was easy, actually much easier than cleaning the blender which took up a significant amount of room in the dishwasher.If you make a lot of soups I would encourage you to add this to your stock of kitchen gadgets."
2,Broke Unexpectedly,"We used this item infrequently, and it broke unexpectedly. It did not live up to the ""cuisinart"" reputation I will replace this with another brand."
4,a word of caution,"The product is everything I expected. I made split pea soup with it and it turned out great. I'm very happy with my choice. A word of caution when unpacking it. When removing the plastic from the blades, remember they are VERY sharp and can easily slice your fimger. Ouch!"
5,Time saver!,I bought this item for baby food and I love it!!! Easy to wash and great for small portions.
4,Cuisinart CSB-76BC Chrome Hand Blender,I enjoy using this hand blender as it exceeds my expectations. It is a little larger then I expected but a very good product at a great price through Amazon.
1,stripped gears,"After very light use over the course of a couple of months (whisking eggs!), chopper attachment started to become more difficult to attach to the motor. Looked at the point of attachment and the plastic gears had completely stripped, making it impossible for the motor to turn any attachments. Don't buy it."
1,Lousy drive,"As in a previous review the drive shaft connection on my blender sheared after six uses. It is no good having a 200 watt moter with a 100 watt capacity drive connection. I have designed drives that the weakest link broke if overloaded. It was like a fuse, easily changed and cheap, not like this thing. Of course I can not get an exchange or a rebate,"
4,Great but not cordless,"I've been enjoying this blender...mostly using it in smoothies and soups. Can't live without an immersion blender. This isn't my first, I've had several over the years. The main comment I wanted to make is this is NOT a cordless appliance. The picture is a little deceiving. All my old immersion blenders have had cords too, but when I saw this, I thought maybe they came up with a cordless version. Nope. That would sure be more convenient though!"
5,"perfect for smoothies, dressings, etc.","I purchased this after I was tired of using my blender all of the time- the little thing is perfect for easy smoothies, omelets, soups, etc. and it's easy to clean too! I would purchase one again for a gift!"
2,One Speed??,"For a 1 speed blender, its awesome but I thought I was buying a 2 speed blender...May send it back."
5,GREAT KITCHEN HELPER.,"I LOVE THIS SMART STICK. I KEEP IT HANDY SO THAT I CAN USE IT OFTEN,...AT LEAST ONCE A DAY. IT IS STARTLING TO ME HOW MANY USES I HAVE FOUND FOR IT, THE BEST IS THAT I DO NOT HAVE TO DRAG OUT THE MIXMASTER OR THE FOOD PROCESSOR OR ANY OTHER GIANT APPLIANCE! MAKES COOKING/BAKING EASIER AND MORE FUN. DONNA HUCABY"
3,Passable,"The main draw back with this model is that it only has one speed with just an on/off button that you have to hold down to use. That said, it does a passable job blending up soups. I tried to make hummus with it and the chickpea puree gummed up the blade. Not sure if other hand blenders do a better job with hummus though."
1,Not durable or reliable- don't waste your money,"I bought this as a replacement for my black and decker blender which was equally as bad.It worked well for the first three to four months, now it's completely broken, even though it was not put to frequent use. Absolutely useless and a total waste of money!"
1,Broke after 2 momths,"The unit broke after two months of normal use. Perhaps it was geared wrong, or the rest of the parts couldn't handle the 200-watt motor. It was past the amazon return window, and when I called Cuisinart they were remarkably unhelpful. Had to throw it away. I'll buy a different brand next time."
5,"Continues as the ""best in class""","This is my second Cusinart SmartStick. (or maybe my third) I use (and have used) the SmartStick EVERY day. It creates my breakfast and starts my day right. After reading some of the reviews, I was worried.... that the newest SmartStick would not live up to its legacy. A legacy of excellent quality and service. No fears. This one makes its predecessors proud. I am delighted... and look forward to wearing it out.... in several years. Thanks Cusinart!!"
5,Cuisinart Immersion Blender,"I have wanted and needed an immersion blender for sometime. From past experience, Cuisinart has been a reliable brand and it has proven so again."
3,Disappointed!,"I loved this hand blender... It feels great in the hand and cleans up better than any I've owned. Unfortunately, the 200 watt motor burned out the 3rd time I used it. I'll stick with 500 watt models."
4,good product,"Although the body/motor of this blender could be a little more solid it works well overall. Works great for our use. My son is trying to put on weight and is making milkshakes every day and this blender is so much easier to use and clean than the regular glass carafe blender. We chose a corded model over cordless because my husband is convinced that the battery ones lose power over their lifetime, whereas the corded ones stay as powerful as they start."
1,Cuisinart blender doesn't,"This is my second Cuisinart CSB-76BC Smartstick blender. They both died prematurely from bad motor or stripped drive-housing. It's a great idea and wonderful to use during its short life, but this particular model is a waste of time and money. I'd recommend spending more for something durable; most likely not a Cuisinart."
2,Awesome.. when it was working,"This hand blender did the trick when it was at it's prime- it even blended frozen fruits for smoothies! But, it stopped working all of a sudden (after a month) and the blade twirled idly when the motor was running fine. I contacted Cuisinart but they took FOREVER getting back to me (they neglected me for a month!) and getting me a replacement part- but guess what? they sent me the part for the wrong model. Now, I don't know if they're interchangeable or not, but my blender is still not working. I contacted Cuisinart once again but it'd probably take another month or so for me to enjoy my smoothies once again... I'd probably recommend this blender if you're doing easy jobs like pureeing soups or blending cream cheese for cheesecake- but not for heavy duty stuff like crushing ice or pulverizing frozen fruits."
5,one just like it,"i got this for a friend for christmas. i use the one my sister gave me to make protein shakes quickly. i love mine. easy mixing, easy clean up."
2,Plastic gears desintegrated after 3 mo.,"It was great while it lasted, especially for making smoothies for my little one. However, after about 3 months of almost daily use, the plastic gears inside simply wore out and it doesn't work at all."
1,A piece of garbage!!!!!!!!!!!,"The blades on this piece of garbage broke off while I was blending some homemade tomato sauce (which of course I had to throw away in case any metal shards remained). If this was going to have a shelf life of only 2 months, I wish Cuisinart would have noted that. HUGELY disappointed in this company. Stay away from Cuisinart products."
3,The invisible cord,"There are already excellent descriptions of the pluses and minuses of this item in other reviews, but I didn't see mention of the fact that this is a corded appliance - something you'd never guess from the photos in which the cord has magically disappeared. Mine was delivered without a manual. It's available online, but I didn't pay for the item so I could then use my printer to print a 25 page manual. And it makes one wonder if I was sent a returned item by Amazon."
4,Good Value Smart Stick,"We have been very happy with our new Smart Stick. We compared other brands and reviews and they were very accurate. Glad we spent a little more and got a good one. If I were to make any suggestions to the manufacturer it would be to include a second mixing cup for convenience. Also would be nice to include a brush designed to clean the underside of the blade. My biggest disappointment has been with the Cuisinart company concerning sharing email information. Ever since I registered my warranty, I have been plagued with junk emails. I requested that this information not be shared."
5,Smart Stick Hand Blender,"Just what I wanted! This hand blender is very strong and very simple to use, clean and store.Just perfect for those small jobs that don't require the full size blender."
1,LOUD!,"i was hopeful that this would be the answer to my dead stick. it was a couple bucks cheaper on the big lady but when fired up it sounds like a garbage disposal. not like the other old one i owned or the demos in stores. so,.....i hope it burns out before the warranty and i'll have to wear headphones when i use it. is amazon (big lady) like the despot in that they pass seconds through to get a cut rate deal? i'm really disappointed guess i should'a got the hammy beach at wally world. gettin' smarter"
4,A useful addition to any kitchen,Good for quick mixing such as pureeing soups. Easy to clean and has good power -- does what it says it does.
4,Easy and fun,"Love it. I've been making pureeing everything just because it's so easy and fun. I've used it for hot soup, frozen margaritas, salsa, as a mixer, and MORE"
5,Immersion blender works great,"This immersion blender works great and has a stainless steel blender area. I use it mainly for making my cottage cheese/flax seed combo (Johanna Budwig diet for those folks with cancer). So easy to use, and comes apart for storing. Highly recommended."
4,i love it,i use it to make shakes with ice and it blends right through it once and awhile it will miss a little ice but other then that its a great product for the price
2,Great while it lasted,"This was a great product while it lasted. I made tons of smoothies with and and it was easy to clean. However, in about 3 months it died. It's not so expensive to replace, but the overall construction (particularly where the motor connects to the blade shaft) is somewhat shoddy."
2,Fail!,"I was enamored with the Cuisinart Smart Stick when I first got it. The power and ease to puree soups was wonderful! I used it only occasionally, probably no more than two dozen times over the past 1-1/2 years. Now, the blade doesn't turn and it makes a high-pitched sound. It must have the same problem other reviewers have mentioned...the plastic pieces have failed. I am disappointed. The partial refund from Amazon would do little more than cover the cost of return shipment. Guess it's time to look for a different brand!"
3,"Mixing-stick needs to break-down more, for complete cleaning!","We've owned our Cuisinart SmartStick for a couple of years, but started noticing black particles in our blended foods. Though we're VERY particular about cleaning up, after using this device, we've realized the ""permanent"" seals in the removable blending-stick part were not doing the job. I'm now looking for a replacement, for the Cuisinart, which can be fully disassembled for cleaning."
4,Only one speed,"For some reason, I assumed this would have two speeds like our last Cuisinart stick blender. This makes frothing milk in a pot a little bit messy. It does, however, come apart for maintenance and storage. Overall, not bad."
5,Great - easy to clean,It is easy to clean but you have to make sure to clean the blades thoroughly. Great product for the good price. I paid $29.99.
1,Blended cogs,"After several years of occasional use and in common with many other buyers, the connection between handle and stick failed. Not an impressive design."
5,Great hand blender for making fresh vegetable soups,"My wife just finished using this blender to make a delicious fresh asparagus soup. The blender works flawlessly, is extremely easy to use and is a breeze to clean. My wife has been using it for years, so it's obviously well built. Also, the strong motor enables her to make delicious vegetable soups in a matter of minutes. I highly recommend this product."
5,awesome!,I still have to get used to it a little bit since I'm kinda afraid things might get splashed as I'm crushing them.But it's so awesome! It grinds things so well and is convenient to use! :)I especially like the fact that it's so quiet and the motor-burning smell doesn't occur!
4,Great Product!!,This is the best hand blender I've ever used. Very easy to clean and powerful. Gets the job done very easily. The green color is awesome too btw!
5,Excelent!,We got it to prepare baby food. I still did not put away. It completely replace my blender and I have been using for everything. It works just amazing to mash food to any consistency and it is very easy to clean up. Very good product.
1,"Simply, filth","Rather than go into a long review, I will keep it simple. This book ended-up in my trash bin after the first chapter. In the Hand of Dante has absolutely nothing redeeming about it whatsoever and is just pure trash."
3,"Lots of shooting: priests, housekeepers, old men, dogs...","This novel's main character, Tosches himself, suffers from terminal cancer, which protects him from being affected emotionally by the violence perpetrated by his criminal associates. It's the only way we could ever sympathize with him, and even then it's not easy.This book reminds me of The Club Dumas by Arturo Peres-Reverte, or even one of Iain Pears' art history mysteries. If you like those books, you will probably like this one. Unfortunately, Tosche's lurid writing will turn off a lot of readers. Indeed, many people won't be able to read beyond the first grisly chapter.The best thing I got out of this book was a desire to take down and reread Divina Comedia. Talk about lurid."
1,Ugh.,"Bought this book because I love Dante and had heard wonderful things about Nick Tosches. After reading it (and I finished it only because I wanted to see if it would get any better) I still love Dante but think that Tosches is overrated, pretentious and suffering from testosterone poisoning. Believe me, I'm not a prude; so-called offensive material can certainly be thought-provoking and enjoyable. But in the contemporary portions of this book the author seems to be crude just to show what an iconoclastic stud he is, while at the same time having nothing of interest to say. In the historical portions of the book, by contrast, he does have something interesting to say but it's buried under an overly vague, artsy-fartsy, stream of consciousness story structure. I'll be selling my copy of this book and rereading the Divine Comedy instead."
1,Don't bother...,God I hated this book. I don't say this lightly. I thought the idea was great and I couldn't wait to read it but...The author is so overrated and pretentious that I couldn't help but laugh at some sections. Did he even bother to give it to an editor? The characters are one-dimensional and the plot is lame. I totally lost interest half way through the book. I continued reading with the hopes that it would get better but it never did.
2,"Lighten up, Nick...","If you're looking for a pretentious, overblown boor, then Tosches is your man. He is so in love with himself that he seems to forget that others might have to read his self-important ramblings. I know he feels there is an artistic purity to all this (he bludgeons us with this premise over and over), but it's just an excuse for self-indulgence. There was a great story here. Too bad he couldn't forget himself long enough to tell it."
5,Great CD,"Great audio although I wish some of the earlier recording were stereo, but still the best sounding CD I've heard by this group."
1,Pretty Lame,I am new to the tortoise scene. I love the sea and cake so I thought I would give them a listen. I really don't know what to say other than this album really goes nowhere. These guys are all obviously accomplished musicians and yes I understand this is their first album. But the songs on here just don't grab you and pull you in at all. I found myself constantly skipping to the next track two to three minutes into each song. A lot of the songs just sound so similar in nature and many start to get under your skin badly. Practically all of the songs on here are just lame jamming with random sound fillers to try to sound cool I guess. I was just bummed out that there was not even one song on the entire album worth a second listen. I mean common. I hope that the other tortoise albums greatly vary from this one.
2,Recording Label,"There is a near duplicate of this product listed. Aside from being a U.S. version (vs the other, imported version), it was very difficult for me to tell which one was which. This title is released through BMG Music. I've dealt with BMG in the past, and would rather support the Monty Python production crew, than a knock-off label. The title you should buy, is the one marked as an ""Import"" because it is released under the Monty Python label. If you're a true Python fan, then you should by from the Python label, not BMG. Here's where to go for the Python label:Monty Python and the Holy Grail"
2,"Pedantic, Self-Absorbed and a Waste of Money.","This book wasn't very good when it was written a decade ago and age hasn't helped it. The authors attempt to apply a scientific method to their analysis of start-ups and potentially succesfull ventures but lack the substance of true quality research. In the end it turns out to be a heuristic that could be summed up in less than a hundred pages if not for the authors' attempting to display their erudition. The book heads downhill when the authors put their ""Program"" for starting a high tech company in a pseudo-programming format and the book just continues to slide further into triteness.There are much better books on entrepenuership. Do yourself a favor and get a business book written by businessmen not by engineers who aspire to be philosphers."
4,Great fun for Amazing Race fans,"This is a very fun game to play. Like other reviewers have said, when you first hear Phil's voice and the AR music, you do get a little tingle, especially those of us that have always wanted to be on the show. I think the game is more fun with many people playing.Two small issues:First, I echo the issues with the final leg. There should be more questions.Second, has anyone else noticed a pattern with the Head Start? I've noticed that if you select a two team game with the red team being the first team chosen, you'll get Dallas as the city every time. This was so much an issue that I actually returned the game because I thought it was defective. Then with my second copy, I figured out that there was a pattern.I do hope that future versions of the game come out. I'll happily buy again."
1,Problems (on some DVD players),"This game kept crashing and the same questions came up time and again, it never changed. We tried to play two games, but the DVD came up with an error after the 1st leg everytime. Did someone else have this problem, or what is just us?---We finally managed to get this to work. It's a fun game but like many DVDs now, it won't work on all players. It won't work well at all on our portable player, but on our little Philips player it worked great. I think they need to maintain some standards with DVDs, imagine the uproar in the past if a given VHS tape wouldn't play in all VCRs! If you can get the game to work and you like TAR on tv, you'll really enjoy the game."
5,just a few simple changes,"my beyblade, draciel s is probably the best blade ever but i made a few changes and added accesories to it. firstly i used draciels attack ring with dragoons weight disk and dranzers spin gear and base. and i used a spring launcher and i have never and i mean never lost a battle..."
4,The best bey blade?????????,"this is the worst beyblade i have ever seen.Please ""DO NOT"" buy this bey blade in y,r whole life!I had enough of this beyblade.do not take it even if you get it for free.when i launch it,the attack axes fly off one-by-one at a 2 second interval.Does this bey blade have defense???Is swear it does not have a bit of it.all the parts fall off within a minute.I had enough of it and i threw it away.shame on its manufacturer.So i repeat,""NEVER buy this beyblade"""
5,Great buy in some ways,This blade is great especially for new bladers.It is hard to judge this blade because it is sometimes inconsistant. When going against an attack blade it can win almost all the time.Yet when going against an endurance type it will take hit after hit and stop spinning. So to stop this problem there is only one thing to do and that is what i am doing . Buy another draciel that also comes with ball bearings.The key is maximizing weight so add those to to the ones already there and you get a realy heavy blade.
3,Bloom's Canon,"What a book!...I know now that there are some people who have failed to read Homer's Iliad closely enough and who still dream for olimpic games in literature... ""A beautifully mistaken book""."
1,Bloom Should Retire,With professional academics like Bloom festering in the ivory tower it's no wonder that the American educational establishment is a bloody ruins.
2,Does this book do Mariah justice?,"This book had a bad beginning, focusing mainly on her mother Patricia. There was not enough information about her school days and it contained nothing a huge Mariah fan like me didn't already know. Most of the book was taken from magazine articles and the author actually spelt Mariah's name wrong. I think this book would be better for someone who wasn't really a fan, as they wouldn't know a lot about her already and the book might tell them something. This book was readable, but very disappointing."
2,I liked it bc it was about Mariah but could have been better,"I read this book for two reasons. One, I love Mariah Carey, and two becasue I had a book report due for a Rock 'n' Roll class. I did not like the begining of the book at all. It focused too much on her mother. It also did not say much of anything about her life in school, which really upset me. There were two points in which the author misspelled her name! I was so shocked I almost put the book down! The pictures were all old and none of them were in color. And after all the fuss about her mother there should have been a picture of her in there!!! I wouldn't recomend the book to a Mariah lover but maybe to someone who has just heard of Mariah. Over all the book was a flop! Sorry, Mariah!"
2,Confusing,"I got this book because of the glowing reviews here, but so far I'm unimpressed. Maybe my expectations were unreasonably high. The tape just starts off with no indication of what page we're on, and picks out seemingly random bits and pieces of the book to narrate. On top of that, some of the dialogues on the tape aren't in the book. This can be particularly frustrating for the beginner, e.g. me. The glossary in the back is not as complete as it should be. I would think it should at least have all the words used in the book so that the reader doesn't have to keep referring to another book or dictionary. Maybe as I keep plugging away at it, I'll learn this language, but this book and tape have definitely not been very user-friendly so far."
5,Best blade every,"Thise blade is the best blade i have. It is relly quick and strong. AS soon as you rp it gets right down to businessand and will break almost avery blade you trow at it,If I was you i will buy it right now."

2,Annoying!!,"The songs on this CD have great lyrics and fun beats but we can't get past the oh-so-annoying voices of the people singing!! They are always out of tune and honestly it sounds like it was recorded by a few people, all with no ability to sing!!"
1,I have not gotten this.,Haven't received so I can't rate it. .................................. . . . . . . .. .. .. ... .. .. . ... . .. .. .. ... . .. .. .. . .. .. . .
4,Potential for Greatness,First seasons are always hard especially following in the shadow of Stargate SG-1 but Atlantis is living up to the potential. There are a few episodes that could have been upped a bit but for season 1 it was very well done with actors and storylines. The potential for a thousand and one things is there and hopefully it will be as successful as it's sister show.
4,Stargate Atlantis,A nice journey into the Stargate Universe that follows from the original Stargate TV Series. A must watch for any entertainment orientated Sci-Fi fans.
1,Excellent Series in a botched DVD release,"Stargate: Atlantis is amazing. Buy it. But not here, or anywhere else in Canada. Due to a mix up, Stargate: Atlantis was incomplete, as the contents on disk one are also on disk five. The problem is non-existent on the US release, so order this from an American source."
5,Her voice is so much alike with my voice! (better than brit),This song is one of my favorite songs! The tune is catchy the beat and rythm is the bomb cause i like acustic type of beats. The lyrics r a little confusing but its all good. Christina if your reading this e-mail me girl! :)
5,This CD is a must-have!,Christina Aguilera's CD has a great beat and will give Britney Spears a run for her money!
4,I liked it,"i enjoyed the single, but i felt it was short. she should've recorded a remix or something to make the single longer. anyways, i think its great, though blessed is slow, but sweet. i think shes way better than britney and has a catchier, maturer tune than to britney's debut song, BOMT. shes pretty and has a great voice too."
4,Christina has a surprise in for y'all!,"You guys that think Christina sounds like Britney don't know how wrong you are. You obviously have not listened to anything else Christina has done. She has a powerhouse voice and a range to mirror Whitney, Celine, and Mariah. And for the person at the bottom, Christina is NOT 16, she's 18 going on 19. Believe me I watched her on MMC back in the days and very soon you'll all find out how talented she really is. ""Genie in a Bottle"" is a catchy song but not a great song, and Christina realized this herself. She in the beginning didn't even want to record it let alone release it because it didn't display her vocals and was more like a teenybopper Britney song."
5,Awesome Song and CD!,"Genie In A Bottle is an awesome song, and so is Blessed! I totally recomend this CD!! It's good to see that one of the MMC girls can sing!! =)"
3,Fiary Tales and Children,"This book does an excellent job exploring the interest children have in fairy tales and why they connect so easily with this genre. The book investigates when a child's interest is at its peak pertainng to fairy tale and the connection between his life and the fairy tale. Fairy tales symbolize a child's conception of the ""real"" world. The author does an outstanding job examining why children are so attracted to the predictability of fairy tales, many having happy endings where the ""good character"" ends up on top. Good book for research on several different topics pertaining to children and fairy tales."
3,DO they work?,Well the ironing on does- the materials does. But once you wash it it comes off eventually it did. My tailor brilliant.I asked him if he could sew it on. He did from the inside. That was the answer. Human ingenuity.
4,Historically Invaluable,"For anybody with a genuine interest (ie. any adult invlolved with the LL program) this is an invaluable lesson in what LL is supposed to be. Carl Stotz tells the story of the first 12 years of LL. The man was passionate about his creation, although not for where it headed as he gradually lost control of the organization. The program ideals are the strength of LL, which Carl fully understood but had trouble getting others to see.Carl passed away near the completion of the book. Kenneth Loss, a longtime personal friend of Carl's writes well of the last few years of Carl's involvement before leaving out of frustration.As a dedicated LL coach and umpire, I could imagine how Carl felt in those early years as the program grew and thrived, and most importantly, what it meant to the boys who played.I would recommend this book to anyone involved with the LL organization, at a minimum to serve as a reminder of what the program is supposed to be and primarily, who it is for."
1,"Doesn't stay cold, doesn't work","They didn't stay frozen very long, so it spent more time in the freezer than on my fan. And unless you are sitting just a couple inches away from the fan, you can't feel the cold air at all. It blocks more air than it cools air. Not worth it. They just don't work."
4,"So you wanna be one, eh?","This book is a great lazy afternoon read.If you have an interest in Law Enforcement,the author does a wonderful job of describing""anything could happen"" events in the worldof Trooperdom. An easy-to-follow, straight fromthe heart book."
4,Informative and interesting,"This is an amusing, long essay about the rise of Bauhaus architecture. Wolfe adopts a sarcastic tone and challenges the ""glass box"" style of architecture. I found this to be very informative and interesting."
5,Great Stuff,"I use this rod for simple blacksmithing, making BBQ steak flippers. It is easy to work with and fits that bill perfectly!"
4,Don't Listen to the Others!,"Get Smart's Bruce and Lloyd Out of ControlIt's not the first time my opinion has differed from the majority, though usually it's a movie others have thought was brilliant but left me in the cold. This is the other way around. I found BRUCE AND LLOYD to be a delightfully silly comedy. In fact, I found it to be far, far more amusing than GET SMART, which for me was ruined by Steve Carell, who I simply don't think is funny. Masi Oka is funny, cute, charming, etc. Nate Torrence is frequently funny, with some priceless scenes (like when he's hitting on the receptionist). The writing is usually very good...again, better than GET SMART. And, miracle of miracles, there isn't one instance of farting or other so-called funny ""body"" humor. In all, I do recommend this movie for people who want a good laugh. (I really don't see what the negative complaints are all about!)"
4,Loved Get Smart? You'll love this too!,You can't just like Get Smart and get this. You have to LOVE Get Smart! We loved this as it just follows Bruce & Lloyd! It was Greatly funny and worth watching.
5,"good product, good service","As ever, the product is excellent and so is the price. We enjoy being able to buy this product at this good price."
2,Who needs dired-up ink????,"The expiration date for these cartridges was August 2010. I started using the first cartridge last week (September 7-9), and after printing one or two documents, I got the signal that the ink was low in that cartridge and I needed to change it. So I figured, ""Okay, it was a fluke..."" and I put the second cartridge in yeserday (September 12). Once again, after printing two or three documents, I got the ""Low ink"" message again.What an aggravation, and a waste of my money, as well. I won't make this mistake again!"
5,"Original, fresh and cheap.","This was a brand-new twin-pack of original HP 22 Tri-color ink cartridges. The expiration date of the cartridges was far off into the future, the same as if I would have bought fresh ones at a local store. What I received looks the same as what's in the photograph. The price was extremely low compared to others advertised on the Internet and certainly much lower than if I had bought them localy. My order arrived promptly. I would definitely re-order one of these two-packs when needed. Thanks Amazon, I enjoy ordering from you."
1,Poor quality,Poor quality. Weak. Flimsy. Not well-aligned. Easy to damage and did damage it while assembling.. Difficult to assemble. Not worth the money. Recommend not buying.
1,"""Eyewitnesses""","""Traveler's"" review cites Micah Wright as a US Ranger ""eyewitness"" to all the burning carnage that was the Panama invasion. Perhaps it hadn't been revealed at the time of Traveler's review, but not only did Micah Wright admit he lied about being part of the invasion, but he was also NOT a Ranger, and HAD NEVER EVEN SERVED IN THE MILITARY.The rest of this anti-American piece of garbage is about as credible as Wright's claims."
4,"A book about Egypt, and a damn good one at that","i read this book as a supplement to my current course in middle eastern politics, spanning from 1800-the present. this book was very informative in explaing the reasons for revolution and instability in eygpt. this was very helpful for my final papaer and exam, and i recommend it to any poli-sci majors."
3,Different than what I expected,"This maybe a good book for those of who already have a solid understanding of chemistry. However, I have purchased this book expecting to learn the most basic concepts of chemistry, and I found it a bit overwhelming. One should keep in mind there's no diagrams with colors and it's quite plain visualwise."
2,Awful,"I looked for years for this album. It got good reviews wherever it was reviewed. Just goes to show you can't always trust the pros. But if you want to save money, trust my ears. This band blows."
3,OK..but doesn't last long!,"Bought this item for my Dell Studio and i must say i was highly impressed with its sleek look. However, the material is not conducive to heavy every day use and in addition, the padding on the shoulder strap flaked aan got thin to the point where it cracked!Its best used as a regular Laptop Sleeve and not a carry bag!"
2,"Great price, but I can't really use this","After reading some of the reviews, I decided to order this slip case. Well, first thing I noticed was the plastic clips for the strap. That's reason enough not to trust the integrity of this bag. The padding is minimal and I think should only be used as a slip inside another solid well built bag. I have to say that the price was terrific and it arrived quickly, nothing against the seller. I just think that some of the reviews here are a bit overzealous."
5,Lives up to the Targus name in Laptop cases,"This is a very nice, well constructed, and lightweight laptop case. It has lots of room for everything you need to carry with you with your laptop. Very fast shipper too! Thank you TARGUS!"
3,Amazing American,"I take my hat off to Mr. Waugh who is a soldier's soldier. His book highlights how long America has been fighting, pursuing, and surveilling the bad guys. Some of the stories/chapters are rather tepid and not really entertaining, but some of the other chapters on Carlos the Jackal and Usama Bin Laden are a little more interesting. In this book one gets to read about the author's exploits in Vietnam, Middle East (Libya & Sudan,) and in Afghanistan which is about 30 years worth of history from a man who lived to fight for America."
1,ripped off,Don't by from this site. Have been waiting for over a month for delivery. When you track the order YOU CAN'T EVEN SEND AN E-MAIL. THE SERVICE IS SOOOO BAD. TOTALLY DISGUSTED
5,Enjoyed!,I enjoyed reading this book. It is fun to imagine what characters in the Bible actually felt. I definitely recommend!
5,A book I have read multiple times,"Francine Rivers makes women of the Bible come alive by giving them emotions and plausible motivations for their actions, while staying true to the biblical account."
5,But now with TRADITIONAL characters as well!!,"This is a great little, general-use, beginning dictionary. But beware, for those of us learning traditional chinese characters first, you'll need something more, as this book uses ONLY SIMPLIFIED CHARACTERS--and they don't actually tell you that anywhere. You have to discover it on your own.I hope they will put out another edition in traditional characters soon. Or else add to the current book both trad. chars. AND simplified ones when the forms vary."
5,Fantastic for a beginner,"I bought a number of dictionaries before a fellow student showed me his copy of the Starter Oxford. I have a number of other Chinese dictionaries but they are all designed with intermediate or advanced students in mind. The typesetting is easy to read, the explanations for usage are very clear, and I appreciate the inclusion of measure words for nouns. You will want to have a larger dictionary to look up infrequently used words, but this is the one to take to class."
3,"Decent start book, but better out there","This is a decent starting book. I enjoyed the small section on the 4 tones of Chinese and basic structure. The lookup section for both english and chinese was very easy to use, but the words included is EXTREMELY limited. If you are serious about learning Chinese, this book is not a good choice, buy a better dictionary such as the Concise english-chinese chinese-english dictionary ..., much better dictionary. If you are looking for something easy to use and read and only look up very common words, this would be OK."
5,Epitome of Jazz,"I took a History of Jazz course and my professor recommended this album. He said something along the lines of, ""This album is a must-have, even for non-fans of jazz."" I completely agree, if you're not intrigued by jazz, you will once you have this album."
1,RVG Remaster...Defective.,"I've tried two copies of this new Rollins (RVG) remaster. The left channel flutters and fades in the same places throughout both discs (e.g., track four, 2:20 - 2:30). I've heard from third parties that this is a problem with the master tapes. I find it makes the reissue distracting and unlistenable."
2,"Satisfactory, but there are better trading books out there.",More of a day trader's book. But the principals can be used for all time frames.
3,Trader starters kit,"Every new trader should buy this book to get an idea of a canned sytem, although the moving parts, and how to value a system."
3,Not Suitable for KINDLE!!,"Although the book's content is good and interesting, it is totally unsuitable for reading and studying on the Kindle.As it is all about charts, analyses, details, it is very (!) annoying not to be able to see or read the charts on the kindle approprietly. Also the browsing/moving forth and back between the charts and text is irritating.This is not the author's mistake but Amazon's.Amazon should warn its customers for this!I just bought the paper back version of the book, but now have double costs of course..."
4,Trading,"I just started to trade a month ago with paper money. It's a good book for a beginner. The book is out of date, 2003 edition. Charts are black-and-white color that makes them difficult to read. Recommended."
4,A family reunion of sorts...,"..But folk die at this reunion..Alot of Lansdale characters show up for this one, and one of 'em, sadly- and WRONGLY doesn't quite make it. He got the reaction he was going for I'm sure. I tossed the book to the floor, yelled at it for a bit. Then yelled at several other inanimate objects before picking it up and finishing it off. Yes, its a page turner, but you get the feeling Hap and Leonard gotta ride off in the sunset eventually. Lansdale doesn't keep them trapped in time like most writers do.They seem to have a timestream outside of the pages, they age with us. Sadly.Bob the armadillo needs his own book though, maybe a childrens book."" Hey kids- Bob carries LEO-PAR-SY"""
4,Better Version,"I believe this one is better than Hong Kong version because...1. Dubbed by Jackie himself2. Ending theme song is ""High upon High"" (by Jackie)Although some scenes are missing and some dialogue are different from original one, this one, as an English version, is worth to have it. Enjoy!(Picture Quality:4, Audio Quality:3)"
1,ALWAYS STICK WITH HK ORIGINAL,"Why American production make HK movies look so cheap? First of all, they cut off so much scene, second of all ruin it by making look acting so dumb by English Dubb. For ANY of HK movies, ALWAYS stick with ORIGINAL LICENSED HK RELEASE. Be careful with cheap imports, boots though."
2,No original language.,"An entertaining film, but this DVD would have been much improved if it would have featured the original Cantonese language track.Release in the US after ""Operation Condor,"" Armor of God actually was made before Operation Condor, and was relased to the rest of the world before Operation Condor.Jackie turns in an entertaining performance as the Asian Hawk, and while Operation Condor is bigger and better, this film is fun also."
5,Low impact living,"Better than a ""survival"" show. This family is LIVING. Low-impact living- this family takes only what it needs and honors the earth while doing it."
2,disappointing mount,"I wanted to replace the static head in my shower with a hand-held to make stall cleaning easier. After giving up on a cheaper plastic head from a local store, I gave this Delta a try. I was very disappointed that the mount felt so insubstantial (plastic parts again). Since the head itself is fairly weighty, placing it on the mount causes the mount to droop to its lowest position. There is some adjustment to the tension in the mount - from loose to not-so-loose. It is simply impossible make it tight enough to hold the head at any angle but horizontal. This was a real disappointment after spending nearly $175 and it will be headed back to Amazon."
5,Excellent book for first time Backyard Bocce info,I bought this book and a Backyard Bocce Ball set for my husband for his birthday and found it very helpful for planning game strategy. We plan to build walls for our game area next Spring using the guidelines in the book. Good book for all beginners to Backyard Bocce!
4,a new twist,"I bought this book for my nephew. It's a new twist on what previous work Santa did that could qualify him for a job as big as ""santa's"" work. It was fun to read & quite possibly answers the question...""How did Santa get to be Santa?"" It also sends the message that you never know how important each job you have might lead to bigger & better opportunities!"
1,Not worth even for few dollars,"Mine plays OK, but I hear ""click"" continuesly - multiple times in a second. It seems to me this comes from the rotors/wheels. Also the product is different than pcitures - wire is straight , not coil type."
1,Did not work...,"I bought it to hook up my cell phone to a 2003 Olds Alero. It didn't work. There was something wrong internally with it. I don't know why, but it played at 3-4 times the volume it should have been at around 15% of the time. Tossed. I found one in a bargin bin at some big lots type of store, and it worked great, so it wasn't my phone... Junk."
5,Oh It's Just A Phenomenal Read,Just absolutely fantastic - Bergreen mixes in-depth research with an easy storytelling narrative that will leave you *screaming* at the pages to *please just give them an orange and the scurvy will go away*I tore through the book. Absolutely recommended.
4,Good Popular History,"Bergreen draws on diaries and contemporary accounts of the sailors aboard for Magellan's voyage. He examines the tensions brewing between the Spanish and Portugese factions of the crew to great effect, providing the reader with a relatable human context to some otherwise puzzling and inhuman events. From Magellan's frustrating pleadings with Portugese and Spanish sovereigns to approve his voyage, to the discovery of the strait, right through Magellan's self destructive deluisions of grandeur, Bergreen provides a readable and compelling account of a frightening and historic voyage of discovery."
4,The Audio Book Version Is Well Done,"The Audio Book version of this book is an abridgement but it is still very well done.I found this a very interesting account of Magellan's voyage of circumnavigation. The author writes well and provides a clear history and analysis of Magellan's voyage, its historical context and the political and financial motivations of its sponsors.I have a 40 minute highway commute to and from work and I typically pass the time listening to audio books. I enjoyed this one and found it very interesting. I'd have no problem recommending this one to others."
4,A sound compilation.,"This is well done....not the BEST compilation guitar finger-style CD, but worthy."
4,Fusion,Perfect background music. Would make a good starter CD for anyone interested in Celtic music.
4,Card delivers what he promises,"The only other review for this product effectively captures what I had to say about it. I post this only to encourage potential readers to first visit the online poetry magazine that Card publishes, called Strong Verse (reachable at strong verse dot org). Their motto is ""Good poetry is meant to be understood, not decoded."" If this sounds like a mindset you agree with, you will probably enjoy this collection."
5,Outstanding!!,"Never before have I had such a passion for reading a book. I am now on Volume 6, ""Praise to the Man"". As soon as I finish a volume, I have to immediately read the next. These books wonderfully and accurately depict Church History. I hope to finish the whole series and read it through again!!"
3,A well done motion picture with an awesome soundtrack!,"A good movie in it's time, and great dialogue and sex scenes by Aidan Quinn and Daryl Hannah. A definite movie of the 80's! Even if this movie mainly focuses on the two of them there's good supporting roles by Adam Baldwin, Cliff DeYoung, Jennifer Grey, and Pamela Springsteen(The younger sister of rocker Bruce). Well acted and very convincing!"
4,Lose yourself in teenage angst,"Upon first viewing the movie ""Reckless"" when it came out in 1984, I was a 13 year old dreamer stuck in adolescent hell and the movie was pure escape for me. I recently viewed the movie again on some pay channel like Showtime and found myself feeling like a 13 year old all over again. The movie still holds the same effects for me now that I'm 27 years old. I can feel Aidan Quinn's strong desire to get the hell out of that town and Daryl Hannah's feeling of confusion- should she follow her heart or do what others expect her to conform to? My biggest question- is there a soundtract available for this movie? It has some totally cool songs that I still want to hear 15 years later, being a big fan of 80's music. If anyone knows where to get this soundtrack, please please let me know, I've been looking for it since 1984!"
2,"Good attitude, little to say","This book is a disappointment. Repetitive and ordinary writing, with little content. I like Bright's forthright attitude about sexual issues. If only she could find something new to say, besides the fairly obvious fact that sex is important."
2,Title is rather deceiving,"So, I bought this book thinking I was going to learn how to ""open up to sexual creativity and erotic expression"" but mostly what I got was ""The World According to Susie."" While some of her insights were actually quite good, I found the book disjointed. Rarely did it deliver what the title promised."
1,*SHUDDER*,"This book has some fundamental flaws. Her random hypothesis, based seemingly on magic and medieval spirituality, is too far fetched to have any practical application in the real world or to any rational person. Her switch from first person to third person to a seemingly mystical nymph all in the same sentence had me at wit's end trying to determine exactly what she was trying to conclude. Having the entire book written without punctuation, correct spelling, or paragraphs had a hard edge when she was trying to prove her point at the beginning, but it soon dwindles to boring drivel and makes it exceptionally uninteresting to read. Ms. Bright should not only get out of her ivory tower, she should jump from its highest point. A must read for anyone recently lobotomized."
5,Quick! Go get this book.,"Why? Because it goes to some of the core questions in your life. It tangles with the way we conduct ourselves as a society. In an age of AIDS, gathering repression, and sex-as-marketing, this is an important book, whatever your gender, age, proclivities, confusions, or politics. This woman is a provocateur, a ranter, and a lover. She won't leave a single sexual opinion anywhere in your head undisturbed. She'll turn you into a wanker, or a visionary. She might even convince you to break your own silence--before it's too late."
5,Smelly... But it does not bother Tina!,"The book is about Tina and how she never wants to take her favorite pair of socks off even to have them washed! I think it is an excellent book for 4 to 8 year olds. We all know how funny it is to children to talk/hear about smelly things! ""Eeew!""The stinky smell of socks does not bother Tina, but it bothers everyone else including the animals... I think that it is hilarious to see what the stinky smell of her socks does to all the animals in her way. I also like how persistent Tina is against everyone telling her to wash her socks! And when her friends cannot stand the smell any longer, they wash her socks! And she figures it all out - why bother washing them, someone will do it for you when they are smelly enough! Her socks are washed by her friends and she gets rewarded with a matching shirt for getting her socks cleaned! Now she has two things she will never, ever take off!"
3,mini guns,okay this is made by CYMAthis comes with a nice black case and a few bbsand a set of clips and guns a silver and blackboth 9 shotstehre prettty good guns i boght mine for 12 bucksand its funtrue my black one broke recently but form a drop and a problem with the lockbesides thta tehre dependible
2,Fun at first but break fast.,The 2 pistols well...suck. Not worth the buy. At first i thought it was good than a day later they both broke just buy firing 2 mags. The black one broke the first day then the second day the silver one broke. SO no not worth the buy.
1,Not good. Don't waste your time.,When I received this product I was disappointed. The guns are made of cheap plastic and look like a toy for a 2 year old. The case was good but the pistols were cheap and they look like they will break after a couple of uses.
1,Lady Longears,"I bought these for my 7year old son's birthday. He has several other softair guns, but none this small so I thought they would be more fun to play with. The gold one's clip cracked the second time loading. I was supervising so I know He didn't drop it or anything. The entire gun is just made out of really cheap plastic. The black one then started missing and kept jamming. When they were working, they didn't shoot very far. I would recommend getting a nicer made gun. The price was appetizing, but the guns weren't worth it."
2,IT's suck,YO this gun it suckcau my cousin got it todaythen we play for 3 hours and the guns are brokenwtf
3,ok,this gun is ok it works fine and doesnt jam but it is pretty weak. i shot a balloon at point blank and it didnt pop.this was my first gun so i didnt now but it isnt strong
2,Not Worth It!,Bought the guns. 1 gun broke within 10 shot and the other gun broke in 2 weeks.the guns would just break themselves when you would try and cock.
4,"Great buy for the money, don't expect years of use","I've had several sets of these little pistols over the years, and I've never been disappointed with them. They're perfect for younger teens and adults that're just getting introduced to airsoft. They aren't ridiculously sturdy or powerful, but they are fairly reliable and fun little guns to shoot. Overall, it's a steal for the eight something dollars I purchased them for, and they're good fun for little backyard skirmishes, but not serious airsoft players."
3,"Could be better, could be a lot worse.","I bought these mostly to use as a stand in for tactical drills with my actual KelTec PF9 9mm hand gun. These aren't exact, but the controls are in the same places and they function similarly. I use these particularly for reload drills and malfunction 'tap-rack-bang' drills. They work fine for that, and would likely work as a stand in for almost any subcompact auto pistol.As an airsoft gun....not so hot. They work, and don't seem as cheap as other reviews make them out to be, but it's a pain to have to rack the slide for every shot, especially in a battle.As far as accuracy, these are nail drivers at close range. For these little guns though close range means 10ft or less. At longer distances, from 10 to around 25ft, they're capable of a body shot without much trouble.Overall, a nice little set to practice tactics with, but not much in the way of an airsoft gun. If you need to run off a stray cat, and can get close, this could do it."
3,One broke and the other is alright,When I first bought these guns and it came in the mail I was very excited to open it up. I ripped the box open and found the two guns in another plastic box (which I actually really liked). I opened that box up too and the lock snapped off which made me realize how cheap these guns really are. The first gun was silver and that the first one I tested. It broke immediately as I cocked it. It turned into 2 or 3 pieces and I was very disappointed. The second gun works pretty well although it is very small. I would have given the guns 2 & 1/2 stars but there was no option to do that. I felt nice and decided to give it a 3 instead of a 2. It came with a small pack of bb's which was nice but that cannot replace the fact that half of what I paid for went to waste.
2,Theyre ok but not worth the price.,"The price is not too bad but with the shipping its not really worth it. I bought them and the black one broke and will not cock. I never used it wrong and when it got jammed it broke from inside. And one of the mags were already bad before I even used it. If your just looking for crapy little guns to have an airsoft war in a back yard or something and dont expect them to last more then a couple wars. Go for it. But if your looking for long durable quality, your looking in the wrong place"
1,this gun sucks,i just got my gun and i as so excited then after 5 min i started to play and i cocked the gun and it did not cock and it broke the first day i lost 1O dollars on this crap if you are a starter like me trust me do not buy this gun
4,There good,I love These guns They took a while to ship but its worth it the guns were about 250 fps and the small like james bond guns there awesome!!!!!
4,pretty good,These are very cheap made pistols but I have to say that for the price they are great. The case is cheap too but it comes in handy. All in all its a good deal.
1,"Sucks for the first week, then never sucks right again","This valcuum is great for the first week. Then you have to clean it after every room. Not only the bagless part, but the filter has to be taken outside and beaten. These filters are $25 and only last 1 week, but Hoover says they last for a year. I called Hoover and they said it was time to change the filter, after 1 week. my brand new carpets can't be that dirty. I am sooo sorry I bought this vacuum."
2,"Excuse me, but....","In a way I understand that our feelings drigger how we feel, act and think. What I don't understand is that so many people at Sept. 11 or in Lousianna were on the same negative wave lenght to pull an act of mother nature or a terrorist attack towards them at the same time. I don't think so."
4,Another take on an old truth - easy read,"I really enjoyed this book. It's another way to say what is a truth about how we humans participate in God. It's easy to read and offers useful ways to practice what she's suggesting.I've read the statements that she plagarized - having not read the books purportedly used by her - I don' know what to say. If a truth, is a truth, is a truth then no one person can own it, can they?"
2,Modern Age [poo],"Although this book does give some good ideas, for the most part it is absolute [poo]. The very idea that I can control what happens to me, such as someone hitting my car, whether or not I'm approved for a loan, or getting a new car, simply by vibrating positively is ludacris. I wish I'd never have spent money on this one. It isn't worth the shipping cost, which was free in my case. I'll admit I'm new to self help books but I have purchased ones much better than this one. Save your money."
5,Excuse Me,"If you are wondering how to stop ""doing"" so much, starting feeling more like yourself, and have more success at the same time, start by reading this book."
5,Change my life!,I give this book to all my new clients. It has dramaticly changed my life and my clients enjoy that I sent it to them. Most tell me they feel much better than they every did or like when they were kids. Great book! What else can I say.
2,Poorly Written Trite That's Neither Informing or Inspiring.,"This books was so poorly written I couldn't even finish it. Read some samples before you purchase - if the pseudo folksy chatty sopohmore style perturbs you , you probably won't get used to it and it will only grate on you more with each page turned.I got about half way through and felt neither inspired nor informed. The poor, muddled writing was a reflection, I think, of unclear thinking. I have heard the author committed assisted suicide, and while I have sympathy for her struggle I cannot recommend this book.I have noticed a pattern with so called ""Law of Attraction Books"" They are saturated with reviews every time a negative one comes up - obviously viral marketing. Its become so pervasive I have stopped trusting reviews on what could be an interesting genre"
1,Worste Self Help Book I have ever Read,"This book is full of good intentions gone bad. Fragmented ideas coupled with faulty logic makes this perhaps the worste book of this type I have ever read. If you are looking for ways to improve your life, look elsewhere."
1,It's not about Abraham,"I was doing a study of the life of Abraham, and bought this book. I discovered that it's not about Abraham, but about Henry Blackaby. I should've known better, having heard him give a seminar that was also mostly about himself. My copy ended up in the trash."
2,A let down.,Much of this book was merely a retelling of what happened in Arthur. It's major virtue is that it helps clear up the end of the last one.
4,Wonderful book series,"Pendragon is a great series. There is lots of subtle story lines within the main story. Easy read as most of the books took me a week to finish. I would recommend getting the e-book as this will cost way less than paperback. Before you start the series, make sure you read the books in the proper order. This is not the same order they were published. I know its weird but I learned this after I finished the entire series. I think the order is Books 1, 2, 3, 4 (first half), 5, 4 (second half). This puts the series in chronological order.Also, if you liked Pendragon, I would recommend Hood, Scarlet, and Tuck. Its about Robin Hood but with a Welsh twist."
3,This bag didn't travel well,"I was so excited when I got this bag in time for a recent ski trip to Europe. I like the size of the bag and the different compartments it has. It was great for two people to pack ski boots, helmets and clothes. Unfortunately upon my return, my bag had lost a zipper and I found a big hole on one of the side compartments. I don't know what caused the big hole on the bag. I know baggage handlers can be super rough with luggage, but I didn't expect the damage on the bag upon my first use. Maybe I got a bad bag but I expected this bag to survive its first use."
4,"Good recipes, but no pictures","I recently found out that I'm teetering on the edge of Diabetes. While I don't have it yet, I need to start eating like I do so I don't get it!I wasn't sure how to deal with that at first. Especially sine I LOVE chocolate and my grandfather who had Diabetes always said he couldn't eat any. So, I began looking for some good cookbooks. I stumbled upon this one. The recipes are great. However, the presentation of the book is dingy. There are no pictures or illustrations. For newbies in the kitchen, I think those are quite necessary.Overall I am please with the recipes and will take my own pictures to add!"
3,If you like Alice Hoffman it's a good read,I have read several of Alice Hoffman's books. I actually read this a few months ago and initially couldn't remember it. Once I did I remember I liked it but obviously not enough to remember it.
2,"Work OK, NOT AS PICTURED","I wanted to replace a broken knob on a Les Paul Gibson guitar.The knobs on it are the same as in the picture BUT the knobs I got are different.The knobs on my guitar and in the photo have a ROUNDED center post. The knobs I got have a FLAT center post.They work but don't match the other three on the guitar.To get knobs with the rounded center post you have to buy VINTAGE knobs for more money. Oh well, I tried."
5,Think and Grow Rich,"I first read this book at 18 now Iam 42. Their is alot of information to digest in his books. I didn't understand him at first but over the years you start to see what his teachings mean. Yes you will stray from his teachings,but I always come back to his books. You will become more wise,insightful,you will take a better look at yourself and your life. If you are a person that wants a better life,this book and try his others to see which others move you!"
2,Excellent and loud speaker and microphone but it is so uncomfortable,"For the price this is a nice Headset. You can hear people very cleraly beacuse the speaker is very loud. Also people can hear you very clearly because the microphone is very sensitive. But this Headset is so uncomfortable, that if I wear it for more than a few mins I have to take it off, beacuse it hurts so much. Also if you have small ears, it wont stay on your ear. I am going to be using a Motorola HS820 Headset which is so comfortable and light. I can wear it for hours and dont even know it is there. But the Motorola HS820 Headset speaker and microphone is not as good as the Plantronics M2500 Headset."
2,Plantronics M2500,Comfortable style. Worked well for about 6 months but the battery went bad. The unit was NOS (New Old Stock) which explains the battery failure. Plantronics sent me another one which worked for about a year before the battery life degraded. Have since bought the newer style which is similar (worn behind the ear)and works great.
1,Boxing Gloves damaged,"I ordered the gloves from Amazon LLC. They were sent from Amazon and the gloves had been cut with a razor blade and had several scuffs and pin sized holes in them. After a hassle of returning them I just gave up and bit the bullet. Do not advise getting boxing equipment through Amazon. Its to much a hassle to return it, and if your using it for actual sparring or competition you need quality on time you dont have time to return items and wait."
5,Great for Cardio Kickboxing,Great buy. Very good price and perfect for what I needed them for: cardio kickboxing class (punching the bag). Even the owner of the club said they were really good gloves.
5,sweet!!,"I purchased these boxing gloves for my sister who was diagnosed with breast cancer 2 weeks ago. She has chosen the theme ""Fight Like A Girl!"" for this journey and these are absolutely perfect for her. She's gonna love em'!!"
5,Fantastic,Everything was perfect. The gloves were brand new and they arrived when they were supposed to. I didn't have any problems.
4,Great for beginners,"I am new to boxing, and was too intimidated at the stores to ask questions. After researching a little at home, I purchased these gloves. They fit well, protect my hands, and support my wrists well. I got the 14oz size, because I wanted to have enough room to wear wraps underneath. I am happy with my choices."
3,mostly happy,"I love the gloves themselves, however, was very disappointed that they smell like moth balls...not exactly the best smell. I have to keep them in the garage in the hope that they will ""air out"" and also so they don't stink up my house. Otherwise very happy with the gloves, they fit well and I like the pink."
5,200 Watt Immersion Hand Blender,"I love it !!! It's beautiful, bright, red and works wonderfully. Brand new and worth the price which was perfect."
4,Rainy Days and Sundays,Enjoyed! Liked the use of short chapters. Gets the point across without being too wordy. Would like to have seen ending embellished more...with a chapter where Long was drilled by cops as a suspect as Forbes and the doctor were.
1,"Wrong Item, Not as advertised","I have recently purchased the Nautica men's watch. The seller sent a brandnew Nautica similar but ot identical to the one shown on Amazon. com. web site. The difference is clear and not subtle. The one shown on the web has a total of 4 cowns (including one crown on the left). The watch that the seller sent has a total of three crowns on the rihgt side and NO left side crown. In addition, the one shown on Amazon.com has swiss movement. In contrast, the watch that I received has Japanease movement. When I contacted the seller the seller refused to pay item shipment cost or addmit to his or her mistake. So I kept the watch. Overall it looks nice anyway.I definitly discourage you from buying from this incooperative seller."
4,Great,"Interesting introduction to the politics of oil and contradictions/hypocricy and propoganda of our gov't. A very quick read, well worth the time."
3,Good But Not Great.,"This was a good book. Not great...but good.Good because the first half of the book was raw, real and witty. You could tell she put alot of effort into the writing leading up to the wedding and the wedding itself. Her self deprecation and pointed observation of the lunacy that surrounds couples and weddings in general made me laugh out loud.Not great because after the wedding...the book sort of dies. Yes there are some laugh out loud funny moments...but not nearly as many as the first half. It's like she became tired and decided to ""phone in"" the last part of the book, from recycled columns or essays previously written. She could have juiced them up just a bit more and this would have been a ""Great"" book.Three Stars Out Of Five."
5,Great book,Arrived quickly & packaged very well. Not damaged during shipment. Would highly recommend all college students or parents of college students to use.
5,to all that think the cd sucks because theres no music...,"anyways too all of you the soundtrack is a tape they found in Josh's car when they disapeared!!! The soundtrack is here to add to the effect that Heather, Mike, and Josh really disapeared and that is what makes the soundtrack so original (to go with an original movie)So anyways this review is dedicaded to the memory of Heather, Mike and especially Josh whose great taste in music inspired this album. R.I.P."
1,Kindle--No Index or Table of contents!,On Kindle this is a useless resource. How can you use it as a reference with no way to find a passage.
1,terrible,i can't recommend this book. there are many other books which are much better. the authors of this book treat you like a first-grader.
4,Great mix with poor sound quality,"The tracks and mixing on this disc are phenomenal! Donald Glaude never bores the listener - his selection is bumpin, with plenty of buildups and breakdowns. To me, some standout tracks are ""Catch Da Monkey"" by Atomic Babies and ""Freaque"" by Andy Trex and Commander Tom. The former has some of the funkiest synths ever towards the end of the track and the latter you just cant help but jump up to when the drums kick in fully.The reason I gave this mix only 4 stars is due to the sound quality of the recording. It is muffled and a bit flat. I really don't understand how this got past quality control at Moonshine or whatever.. Donald's other mixes are crystal clear, and those are recorded live. If you can overlook the poor sound quality (I know I can) all you have to do, as the beginning of the CD instructs, is ""sit back, relax, and enjoy."""
2,Oversized cut & paste fanzine,"While something like this has really been late in coming the production suffers from a shoe string budget & it's unfortunate that the work of one of dark rocks true esoteric & underground characters has been reduced to a cut & paste booklet with poor binding. On the plus side there's tons of photos, lyrics, poetry, & art on display that disburses the genius that was Rozz Williams. ""From Christian Death to Death"" is an astounding notion but it's one that in reality should get an improved release."
4,Nice Wooden Bokken,"This is not the highest quality bokken, but it's solid and serves the purpose. I wish this wooden sword had more of a true curve to simulate the katana, but this works just fine."
3,Good bokken can withstand hits,"Even if it is not meant for contact, good bokken can withstand hits. I ordered mine from e-bogu and have hit solid ice and trees thousands of times without a single crack in my bokken. It only chipped very slightly when I accidentally rammed it into the asphalt once (which I would expect), but still can withstand getting pounded against trees no problem.If this thing really does break after one hit, then it's clearly poor craftsmanship."
3,bummer.,"I received the sword in a timely fashion and it is of good construction, however, the end of the handle (the ONLY part that isn't covered by the wrap) has a large chunk of it missing. There will have to be lots of sanding and wood filler applied to be able to utilize it without having to worry about splinters. I'm using it as part of a cosplay costume for AWA, so it can't be returned and receive another in time, but I'm glad that I have the ability to modify it. I feel bad for those that will also get one in this condition and not have the tools to fix it."
4,great!...wrong color.,"This was a really nice product, the feel is comfortable and not too heavy. The only (and obvious) difference is that the one I got was black, not the brown as you see in the picture. And I spotted a noticable crack in the tip of it, but seeing as how it's cut with the grain, it was probably inevitable. This is still swing-able, and I bet you could do some damage with it, as long as you're not hitting any trees with it. I wouldn't even recommend hitting people, for legal reasons. Besides the big differences, it was shipped on time, and it's very smooth, and the black color's even starting to grow on me. It looks cooler."
4,Good Overall,"When I saw the price I jumped. Only $10? This bokken is worth it. There was a little unevenness in the carving, and a crack near the middle of the blade, but you get what you pay for. It was a great buy, it looks really cool- It got me on Barstool U! The decorative string on the handle is useful in that the diamond pattern lets your fingers grasp the sword while the string wicks away any sweat on your hands. A sheath would have been a good addition (just for the sheer fun of pulling the sword out) but honestly, this was something I would buy again to practice swordplay. Overall a great product, you should buy it!"
5,Daughter N Grandma,"My mom collects pigs and when I saw this I knew I had to get it for her for Christmas. It was very soft, well-made and was a big hit. When you press his front paw, he snores . . . making a wee, wee, wee sound as he exhales. It was hilarious! All the family that was there when she opened it got a good laugh."
2,A surprising disappointment,"after reading the review in the Horn Call, I couldn't wait to hear this CD. Too bad more thought and work couldn't have gone into it. The balance is lopsided, the tightness of the ensemble lacking and thematically it lacks cohesion."
2,Wish i could give this a better review,Didn't really do anything but make me queasy. Their nettle root product however was very helpful.I recommend against throwing down on this one unless you have tried it before.
1,DON'T BUY IT,"BOUGHT MEDIUMS. WAY TOO BIG FOR MY 5'2,110 LB. FRAME. THE CHEMICAL SMELL WAS SO BAD I HUNG THEM BOTH IN THE GARAGE TO AIR OUT. THE ODOR WAS GIVING MY FAMILY HEADACHES SO I GAVE THEM TO THE GOODWILL."
3,Tropical Pacific Reef Fish Identification,"Mostly a really good imitation of the original. Downsides are that this book isn't spiral bound and a few of the darker photos are blury and/or too dark to get a good idea of what to look for when diving. Otherwise, you get what you paid for."
2,Nothing earthshattering. Could've been said in one chapter.,"Somewhat disappointing read in that there really wasn't any synopsis at the end of the book to bring all of the cases in point and related ideas together to make a coherent ""call to action."" While the information presented is interesting, educational, and valuable, the concept of ""demand chain management"" is not all that radical. The fact the more companies do not engage in the practice is what's really radical! There is no excuse for not conducting rigorous market research and analysis and gaining an intimate understanding of the customer base being served (or disserved in some cases). Mr. Blackwell's information could have been summed up in a 15 page article in a respectable journal. There was no need to produce an entire book on this."
5,Great Deal - All You Need !,"I am very pleased with my new Delphi Nav200, my wife and I just returned from an 1,800 road trip and it worked great. It's not loaded with all the fancy options but it did everything I needed it for. Easy to use, and accurate. My wife didn't want me to turn it off !"
2,junk by GM,"As a Ford man I should have knowen better than to buy a GPS made by GM. The battary will not last more than 20 min's. It can't fine many streets ,it don't see north or south or east or west street's . I would not buy again ."
1,unhappy,"Tried to get it to work for a few days then called the company to see what I was doing wrong and they determined it was an internal problem , to send it back for replacement and when I contacted the seller he said I had only 3 days to find the problem and send it back. I think that was unfair. Carolyn Witt"
1,Delphi NAV200 died after 1 month,"I was very excited about this GPS, many feature including movie playback. Getting movies into this, was long and arduous. I was hoping to show my demo reels on it, but to much work to load them, some would work, others not, even though they were made in it's video settings. The display in GPS mode was to crouded with sidebar info, and street info is too small. This GPS case is used by many other manufactures, look at Uniden GPS and others. The GPS case has no reset button, so when it bugs out, no way to reset it. My delphi I took on a trip to LA, when I turned it on, the buttons glowed but the screen was dead. This is when this Delphi NAV200 turned into junk, a completely dead unit, when I needed it most. Buying a Garmin Nuvi 350, tired of cheap units flailing. This was my 3rd GPS I tied, and like my ViaMichelin X-930, these cheapies are failing, wasting my time and money."
2,Vtech IA 5823 - 5.8 GHz Cordless Phone,Not very happy with this phone. It works ok when close to the base but get a small distance from it and it will not work. My old phone worked better then this one but had no caller ID. If you expect this phone to work some distance from the base Don't Buy It!
1,VTech IA 5823,The worst phone I ever baught. I have since a month later baught a new phone. Can't not hold a long charge. Battery life is very very short. Annoying. Not happy.
4,Nice for yoga,I really enjoy this CD for my yoga practice. More yoga studios should have this kind of music to play.
3,Had some bad experiences on dates lately? Take a tip.....,"I rated this 3.5 starsThis book was light and amusing and I enjoyed it - pretty far fetched and totally unrealistic so you can safely say it is total escapist chick lit with a twist. This is what happens when a smart woman gets a bad idea to take care of the conditions she faces when dating in our world today. It's all about retraining. Everyone can learn, right? You just need the right classes and the right teacher. Enjoy!"
4,Tribute does well,"I bought this CD after having seen a spectacular ""tribute to blue grass"" produced by Ricky Skaggs et al on Public Television this spring. I have enjoyed this CD. At the moment, it's one of the CD's I reach for first.I haven't bought much bluegrass in the past (Alison Kraus and a few others aside), but this CD has inspired me to increase my collection of some of the famous artists on this CD."
3,Not what I expected.,"I was a little disappointed in this. I thought the CD would have an African flair, or at the very least, would sound ""latin"". I thought it sounded more like just big band jazz, but with no latin sound. For example, Machito's ""Tanga"" I really love, but there was nothing remotely like this on this CD."
4,caution advised,"I would recommend the prospective buyer to investigate carefully this cd: some songs are familiar, like ahbez' nature boy or waller's jitterbug waltz. But this is not a standards cd: the songs are basis for some experiment. I personally like it, but understand that it might catch some by surprise. As I write this, there are used versions avaible for less than $5, which means some people bought it and are now really trying to get rid of it. I'm keeping my copy.The atmosphere is very mellow throughout the cd. It is very spare, with very relaxed tempo. I think it is the slowest version I own of the jitterbug waltz mention below (out of 3). Hall and Hill are great players, who would take first credit over Osby in any jazz antology, but here are relatively subdued. Nature Boy is very haunting, almost hypnotic. Most of the other songs were composed for the session. This cd grows on you after several time listening to it, but it takes some effort to get into it."
4,Steiner Styling Taffy review,"The taffy quickly added volume and style without have to use mousse or a curling iron and hair spray. I have also tried two other similar taffy products and had landed up throwing them away. The only down side is that once you style your hair it last for 3 or 4 hours at the most and then needs to be touched up again. Also, the taffy leaves you hair a little dull, so I would also like to see something added to the product that would add shine to your hair."
5,Good survey of the St. Louis area's architecture,"This is one of the best guidebooks for a city's architecture I've seen. The entries cover not only St. Louis proper but also the entire metro area, reaching far into the suburbs in both Missouri and Illinios. Every entry has at least one photograph, a rarity for such books. The maps are clear and concise; a regional map shows where each local map is located. Also includes a number of color photographs in the introduction pages. About the only thing I would fault the book for is skipping a few of downtown's historic towers; however, the book does an excellent job of directing city explorers to St. Louis's most interesting areas."
5,Nice compilation,"This was my first Troika cd so other than listening to snips on Amazon I didn't know what to expect - just knew that the snips sounded great. As it turns out the whole cd is great. It reminds me a lot of Kitaro in terms of both sound and rhythms. There are no vocals - its all instrumental. The songs are very well done, each is different, interpreted I think to the goddess after which it was named - one may have more piano type sounds, another some chimes, another harp, another drumming. Personnaly, I wouldn't be able to listen to one and say - oh that one definitely embodies Athena, or this one definitely says Kuan Yin - but the idea is great and the songs are all really well done."
4,Mystery that comes alive...,"In my opinion the book She Walks These Hills was very slow in the beginning. For about the first couple of chapters I stayed lost. After that the book went into great detail and I begun to really enjoy it. I would recommend this book to anyone whom loves a mystery novel with lots of suspense. I am sure that everyone has heard the expression of how history repeats itself, well this book is a great example of just that. The book also had it's own way of making people see reality in another light, many of the conflicts that occured in this book occur in everyday life around the world. That is the true reason I feel so strongly about this book."
1,Not a page turner,"Too many characters and story lines makes this book hard to read. Definitely not a page turner. The author does a great job of uniting everything in the end, but it was hard to stay focused up until that point."
3,Read for book club,"She walks these hills was selected by a member of my book club for the month of February 2012. I ordered it to read for the club, but have not felt like reading as I will have surgery on the 15th and will miss book club this month. I do plan to finish the book so I will have read all the selections, but not this month. I have read Sharon McCrumb before and enjoy her style of writing."
5,Sharon McCrumb - not just for mystery fans anymore,"Once upon a time, Sharon McCrumb wrote nice little mystery stories. They were funny, well plotted, and lots of fun to read. But definitely for mystery readers. With the two earlier books of her ballad series, If Ever I Return Pretty Peggy-O and The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter, she began to gather depth and strength. Now, in She Walks These Hills McCrumb has become a true novelist, weaving history, folklore, humor, and the everyday concerns of real people past and present into an intricate and haunting story. Though it won't disappoint the mystery readers, She Walks These Hills is a book for readers of all genres."
3,"Very good, enjoyable, interesting, but not a five-star book","I enjoyed Ms. McCrumb's book. I liked the characters, especially the college professor lost in the woods and Mrs. Pentland & Nora Bonesteel. But I didn't think the book was a five-star novel, nor the best novel of the year as the cover touted."
4,good summer read,Had to buy this book for a class on Appalachia history & was not looking forward to reading it. But I was pleasantly surprised--it was a fun and easy book...great summer book!
2,Disappointed,"Although there are a few pearls contained in the video, I was disappointed in the overall content. Music was too loud and solid pointers too few. Shima is a great shooter and more was expected of him. I understand his clinics are wonderful, but this was not one of them."
1,Stay on Target,"My mother purchased this for me and I have returned it,without viewing.Several friends have it and feel that it is overpriced for the content.Regards,Doug Smith"
3,Could be better,"Functionally, it's great. It has just about everything you'd want for charging AA or AAA batteries.The display is miserable, and why I'm knocking two stars. What you see changes depending on viewing angle, and requires some interpretation and guessing as to what is actually going on.That said, I still use mine, and have no intention of switching any time soon."
5,Great,This has more buttons and whistles and bells! If you are interested in batteries and want to analyze them this is a must have. But beware... it may be more than you want!
3,Complicated,"This charger gives the battery condition and has more functions than most. However, the instructions are difficult to understand when using the advanced functions. However, if you understand electical terminology it is superior to other chargers that only charge batteries."
4,Works as it should,"No problems with this one, it is dependable,does what it says,dont have to worry about fires, never gets hot.Well made product.Mine is in constant use.... AND HAS ALWAYS DONE ITS JOB."
2,Not worth the money,"This item does not perform as described in several ways: First, it is not quiet. It literally sounds like a barbeque rotisserie. There's no way you would want to keep this display on in a room unless you were hearing-impaired or really like... barbequing. Second, it's flimsy and poorly constructed. The wheels that the turntable coast on are at slightly different heights, so the table tends to ""flop"" slightly as it rotates. It also has no door to hold the batteries in the unit's base. Third, it does not support anything close to 2 pounds. Anything over one pound taxes the motor to the point where it gets jerky. I used a 1.75lb weight to test it and it virtually grinds itself to a halt. Fourth, it turns twice as fast as described. A one pound weight turns at 4 rpm, not the 2 rpm as described. For the price, I expected a much higher-quality product. This thing would better serve as a paperweight. As long as it was turned off of course. Save your money."
3,"The Shadow, alone, was master of the grove of doom!","I just read this book, which is the first The Shadow book I have ever read. I don't know if this was a good first book to start with, because it doesn't really explain much about who The Shadow is, and why he does what he does. Most of the book is devoted to the feuding Chittenden family, with The Shadow not showing up until a third of the way through the book. But it is still pretty entertaining, in a pulp fiction kind of way."
5,Great value,Quiet Heart & Spirit Wind is a 2 disk CD. The music is very calming and some pieces are hauntingly beautiful. I recommend this CD collection to anyone who loves to listen to flute and Native American flute music. The music is great to listen to while driving in rush hour traffic to keep me calm.
3,I wish I could have more...,"As someone who's admired the sexy acting work Gina Gershon has done on screen for years - including in Prey For Rock And Roll - I expected her to rip into her singing gig on the soundtrack, but I'm afraid I didn't buy it. There's good studio musicians and high-power producers (i.e. Linda Perry) involved, but the whole affair doesn't sound like more to me than an ambitious con at recreating the sound of more energetic female-led songs (is this like Sleater-Kinney or even The Pretenders? not really). I think that's because, despite a few wonderful exceptions like ""Punk Rock Girl"" or ""Pretty Pretty,"" the songs feel a little soulless, as though their waiting for Gershon's sexy performance to complete what's missing musically. Which is to say, this ambitious project only sounds like more of an acting gig on each listen."
4,The Sequel is Rarely as Good as the Original,"Another series of short essays on current issues in the churches of Christ. This book is similar in structure, tone, and content to the author's original book: Tradition, Opinion, and Truth. Like the original, this book contains many novel and, occasionally, deep thoughts that break the mold of traditional thinking and open the heart to new possibilities and perspectives. For some reason, I did not find this one quite as stimulating as the original--or perhaps it was too stimulating. It seemed to give me a case of ""change overload,"" a sense that some of the essays were written more for ""shock value"" or to encourage ""change for change sake"" than ""responsible change."" Still, I can recommend this book to the awareness of congregational leaders and other mature Christian thinkers. May we never forget Him who does not change."
3,Started out great,"The movie certainly had a great start: an ambitious journalism student in search of her big break finally got her hands on something that might turn out to be the story of the year, met a rich and handsome businessman, fell in love and yudda yudda yudda. Woody Allen's character is annoying because he won't stop talking and the ending is disappointing. When the movie ended i felt like the story wasn't finished."
1,Could have been SOOO good!,"Hugh Jackman? Scarlett Johanssen? Great premise for a movie? How could this film be anything but great? Simply by Woody Allen's insistence on being on screen FAR TOO MUCH. His usual whiny, stuttering schtick completely ruined what would have been an otherwise charming film. Wanted to quit watching after 5 minutes of Woody, but stuck around for the two headliners (and the fact that I had paid for the download). Utter, annoying waste of time."
1,crappy movie,"if you like the old ramblings of the very ""not funny"" old koger that is woody allen then you might like this movie. if however you do not and you prefer movies with good acting and clever humor then avoid this dumb stupid movie. what a complete waste of $5 at blockbuster - not even worth the dirty chewed gum that my shoe collected on the way out of the store.The worst part is that allen got the hot Scarlett Johansson to basically be him - his only direction to her must have been, ""uh yeah uh yeah yeah uh uh uh BE JUST LIKE ME! RAMBLE ON LIKE AN IDIOT AND MAKE CHEESY ONE LINER JOKES THAT ARENT FUNNY! YEAH THATS IT!""do you really want to see that?"
3,Woodie's Wooden Movie,"This was disappointing. Allen's acting was absolutely old hat. Just the same shtick we have been getting from him over the course of two millenia. Scarlet Johanson has two very nice breasts but is otherwise not well displayed. I had to ask what her love interest/the villain saw in her character that made him fall so much in love with her. Unless it was those two breasts.... (But I liked her in The Other Boleyn Girl and on Saturday night Live.) And the character of the ghost was both unnecessary and unbelievable. As Cassandra Peterson says that they say at Groundlings, ""If they don't buy the premise, they won't buy the bit."" Though Allen is supposed to be a magician, there was no magic in the film."
2,Flat and forgettable,"If you're looking for dynamite Woody Allen films, this isn't it. I actually spent a good portion of the movie hitting the fast forward button looking for substance, but was severely disappointed.The main characters are flat, stereotypical, and lack development throughout the entire film. The dialog is stale and there's virtually no chemistry between Johansson and Jackman. Allen tries to take a comedic lead in this, and while his scenes with Johansson are palatable, any of the scenes where he ""takes the stage"" are cringe-worthy.I personally had such high hopes for this film, and think it's about time that Hollywood stopped remaking classics that have nothing wrong with them, and instead re-package films like this that could be memorable and fall completely short. Johansson and Jackmen are great actors and I felt that with some better material that they could've at least made this something worth watching more than once on a dare."
4,"Ironically, it could have been half as long.","I really do enjoy reading Mark Nanos insightful studies of NT books. I wish he could somehow cut his sentence length by 1/2 to 2/3's. This would make for easier reading & less difficulty connecting the multiple ideas, contrasts, & comparisons often found within a single sentence--there a joke in there somewhere. Perhaps suffice to say you won't get through a sentence of this book in a ""Nanos' second""--it takes much longer. I found his conclusions both plausible & well supported, but not as thought provoking as his Romans work was (for me anyway). Maybe it's just because I anticipated what I could expect from him after reading his Romans book. Overall, an informative book that Reader's Digest ought to consider for it's Condensed Version Library."
4,"Well, I think it's pretty good...","Maybe I have a different book than the other reviewers? I find the quality quite good for the price; the maps are very attractive with lots of detail; the explanations of world regions are really interesting. Just look at the pages for a region you don't know very well, in my case Kazakstan and the other central Asian republics. In twenty minutes I learned a good deal about these areas. Especially useful are the small side-maps with arrows and text showing the main geographical features. For areas I know a lot about (e.g. northern South America) the information seems quite accurate, given the scale. I compared many atlases of similar size and price in the store and this was by far and away the best."
3,A disappointment.,"I was hoping for a book on airship construction. This is all primitive airplanes. Also kind of a badly put together book at that. Still for the price, probably worth it for the aviation enthusiast. Just kind of ""meh"" though, compared to some of the other books I've picked up recently. I have to be honest though, my negativity stems primarily from the fact that I'm interested in airships, not airplanes."
2,Not helpful,"I lost my husband to cancer and have been very sad so I decided to purchase this book hoping it would comfort me in some way, however it was of very little help to me. The author tries to cover all situations so there is lots of information that has nothing to do with me. I'm sorry I purchased this book and feel I wasted my money."
1,Not worth the money,"I have already went through two of these DVD players. They work great for about 3 months then suddenly quit working altogether. I've lost two DVDs. One was a disc from a boxed Season set--Not cheap to replace. Not worth the expensive price for 3 months of use. My last one quit working 3 months and 1 week after the purchase date, so Walmart was unwilling to exchange or refund my money."
4,EVERTHING I LOVE BE,"MS ELIAS IS ONE OF THE GREAT MODERN FINDS FROM BRAZIL. SHE HAS TO BE ONE OF THE BEST WOMEN JAZZ PIANO PLAYER I HAVE HER IN 2O YRS. GREAT STYLE FAST IMPROVE .I HAVE BEEN INTO JAZZ PIANO STARTING AT THE AGE OF 12. I LISTON TO EVERYTHINGIN JAZZ 51 YRS LATER I PLAY BY HEAR .

2,Nonstick coating peels off,"I loved this Metro cookware set when I first bought it mainly because of the red color, but after a few weeks of using them the nonstick interior layer began to peel badly. I'm wondering if these posts are really safe to cook with due to the insides peeling like that. I would have no problem if it were just the outside peeling, but peeling inside...I don't know. I can not honestly recommend this Metro cast aluminum cookware set to anyone."
4,"Once you're in, you're in","I admit it - the first time I heard this CD, I paused a little. In other words, it takes some getting used to the first time you hear it...but after that, it's perfect for when you're feeling dark or broken, or need to express your anger through music!"
4,bravo for Vitus,"Anyone who finds this movie non enjoyable really needs his/her head examine.What a pleasureable 2 hours of warm hearted movie making.Its filled with light humor and nothing offensive.I won't tell you what it is about because the box says it all,but seeing this gem is another story all in itself! I loved it! Hope you will too!"
4,It's as expected,"Bought this for my older child, and it's pretty much how I remember erector sets as a child...She has lost some of the pieces, and those little screws can be a pain...but it's fun to play with...definitly would avoid for smaller ones but for over 8 I think it's a great toy."
5,Accurate portrayal of A Great Time !!!,"I worked for Warner/Cosmos for two years in the late 70's early 80's partly in Pele's office. This movie was a very accurate portrayal of the ""scene"". I especially like the Warner Executive's description of Pele's entourage. Schisto was a really nice guy and Pele was always the one bringing in those new very cute Brazilian players to the team, Marino stands out in my mind. I'm so glad they captured the offices and especially the doors of the elevators with the pictures of the Players on them and the BRIGHT yellow phones! No shots of the parties at the Stadium Club though after the games. That was where you would always see the players and the guests. Eric Heiden stands out most in my mind. He had thighs bigger than my waste. If you like Soccer and you like 70's Rock N Roll...you'll LOVE this movie! Very very very funny!"
4,Mostly Opaque,"When you sit, the knees are not fully opaque. They are comfortable. The sizing was correct, and they fit well."
4,soft and matte,"I loved the tights! they are opaque and trully blue, realy SOFT. I would't say it's ""control top"" because I don't feel it's too tight or shapping but it's tight enough for not falling, and not to tight to be unconffortable. I will be buying more of these."
3,"Not bad, but not great either","I managed to snag a tear in these on the first wearing, as much a reflection of my clumsiness with tights as with the flimsiness of the material. As it was a superficial tear on the back of the leg, however, I continued to wear them.They do a decent job with the ""control"" part of the name, but they are only partially successful with the ""opaque"" part. For someone as pale as me, it becomes glaringly obvious that these are not truly opaque -- I may just need to buy leggings if that's what I truly want.They were comfortable, though I found the top (yes, that control top) had a greater tendency to roll than most other tights I've worn, which was an annoyance but it thankfully did not interfere with anything."
3,Letters From Atlantis,"I would recomend people who are interested in fantasy, Atlantis, or time travel to read this. This book was very interesting to me because I'm really into fantasy and Atlantis. This is an extremely interesting theory of the destruction of Atlantis and it could very well be true. Another reason this is a good book is because of the conversations that Prince Ram and Roy have after Roy confesses he is in the Prince's mind. I thought that those were the best parts of the book."
2,too much $$$....... too much trouble,"I was eager to try and could not wait to get but was fairly disappointed. this only works on firm vegtables and when you center vegs on the blades only get about 3/4"" of cut whatever, certainly not a speedy process.Also, the blades are a pain to change. This is the worst online purchase I have ever made and wanted to send back but the site said exchange in case of defect only. More or less buyers remorse .... too bad. I did give two stars because the thing is real sturdy. so, I was afraid to throw it."
1,I would like to return it,It was a waste of time purchasing this spiral vegatable slicer. The blades are extremely difficult to change and found this item hard to use. How do I return it?
1,"Zero stars, if possible.","This product cost a lot and did not work even once. No matter how soft the vegetable, it simply wouldn't do what it was allegedly designed to do. One of the worst kitchen purchases I ever made."
1,Tough read.,"It was a good read, but it wasn't able to hold my attention for long. Maybe if it had some pictures or something..."
5,Nascar DVD,I am very pleased with purchase. Very fast shipping and in excellent condition. I highly reccomend this seller to all.
5,"Feliz Navidad, Jose Feliciano","There is no one like Jose Feliciano's Christmas music. The Holiday arrangements from Feliz Navidad which makes you sing a long and also makes you dance.........to the beautiful Silent Night which gives you a warm feeling,makes you smile, remember old times and makes you hug and kiss all your loved ones and friends. I had this on a 33rpm record......somehow it got lost.I said to myself let me go shopping online.....I selected ""AMAZON'........AND NOW I AM UPDATED WITH A ""CD"". Thk you.!!!"
3,Not worth the money,"A Lulu to leave you cold: Maazel's conducting is far from the electrifying, and cossets the music far too much. The good cast is not put to use as it should be."
1,STAR SEARCH MUSIC....,"If you liked Star Search music back in the days, then you will love this CD, but this is definitely not house music!!!"
1,SHOP ELSEWHERE!!!!!,I HATE Amazon. I have ordered approx 6 items from them directly and 4 of them have been wrong or the orders canceled altogether.
5,The saddest book ever!,"I certainly would have given this book a 10 if it had not been for the horribly depressing ending. But besides that, this is a wonderful book. It's got everything a book could contain packed into it : love, murder, suspense, humor, mystery, horror, and tragedy. I doubt Alexandre Dumas has ever written a happy ending in his life!"
2,Not a professional unit,"Up front, I'll tell you that I sent it back, even with the return shipment charges ($28). This is a flimsy, low quality effects unit. I replaced this with an older model Yamaha EMX 2000 powered mixer, to my great satisfaction."
2,Not a good case,The case is not very sturdy....the edges broke within a week..i have not dropped the phone or mishandled it. It is either sitting in my pocket or on the desk.
4,Good Album,It wasn't a surprise that Mr. Del would deliver another hot album. The production is good. The lyrics are cool. Mr. Del is a good gospel rapper
3,A sword-and-sorcery saga for the Viking in you,"'The Broken Sword' is swift, brutal, and morally grey. Anderson packs a tremendous story into a mere 207 pages; while characterization is necessarily sacrificed, his prose is potent and the setting captures a wondrousness so often neglected in recent fantasy epics.Anderson's grim but poetic approach to Norse mythology and story-telling tradition make this a unique addition to any fantasy collection. It's not likely to be your next favourite, but it will stretch your understanding of what fantasy can be."
5,The answers to all your questions!,"For the actual title of the book, check out the following BBC website: http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A533800This website also has the solution to Masquerade."
3,"Interesting, but maybe better from a British perspective","As an American, I may have missed some of the book's finer points due to possibly not ""getting"" the social and political realities for lesbians in Great Britain. It does, however, cover the range of emotions in being a latebloomer and has numerous stories depicting different situations. I would think this would be a very good read for a British latebloomer; the tone is very, very British."
4,Another Year,"There is a time and a place for reading Peter Mayle. The best place is in Southern France in the heat of the day, over a bottle of Chateauneuf du Pape. On rainy afternoons in Liverpool, something is missing.In this latest book he tours France visiting various festivals related to particular foods and wines. Frogs - with remarkable thighs in Vittel, Chickens in Bourg en Bresse with perfect colouring - Red, White and Blue of course, Wine in Beaune, Scantily clad women in St. Tropez (?). They are all here. They are described with his usual humour and observation. If you love food, wine or France this is for you. If not you may become a convert.A nice holiday read."
1,carrageenan -ALLERT!,"This product caontain carrageenan(from seaweed). Sounds natural, but the final product can cause stomach cramps and other intestine problems!So MOMS be aware!!"
5,How Do Dinosaurs Count to Ten?,"My grandson has several of these ""How do Dinosaurs....."" books and I wanted to add to his collection. He LOVES Dinosaurs!"
5,Give Tookie a Get of Jail Free Card!,"I work at a private school, teaching a first grade class. Mycolleagues and I found Tookie's books on gang violence fascinating andinformative. The glossary was particularly helpful, defining streetterminology such as 'hood and street soldier. My only lament was thatTookie himself could not be there in person to offer further adviceand words of wisdom."
5,Love it!,"I have had many vaccuum cleaners...from the cheapest to Dyson and Oreck.This one I love the most. It is simple to use and does the job well. It's easy to clean furniture, lamp shades with the attachment.It's easy to empty.What more can I say? I highly reccomend it."
2,"Good suction, but Horrible Design","The vacuum works very well... the first few times I used it, I was amazed at how much dust & cat hair it picked up. HOWEVER, the vacuum has an incredibly bad design. To clean up, you have to remove the hepa filter and ""tap"" it clean. Yeah rite -- the dust gets all over the place when you do that. And since you have to gently ""tap"", you never get the thing clean, and if you accidentally tap something against it, once again, all of the dirt is all over the place. I wonder what this company was thinking."
1,Very upset with this model,"I bought this product because our friends swear by it. She checks all the reports about it and says it is great. However, I ordered it and within a few days the agitator stopped working. Amazon customer service was great and replaced before I had a chance to say anything. We received the replacement and the same thing happened. Although this time, not only does the agitator work when it wants to, we now have a really bad burning smell in the house. My wife is so angry about this that she wants it sent back and nothing to do with Hoover. I'm very disgusted by this product."
2,HARD ON THE EARS,I loved Mike Rowland music back in the eighties when his music first came out. I listened to Fairy Rings over and over again. I recently decided while I was looking for some similar music to help with meditation to see if his music was out there anywhere. I downloaded Fairy Rings without even listening to it. I was heart broken to find the sound quality is so poor I cannot enjoy Mr Rowlands wonderful music. Maybe the cd would be better but the mp3 download was bad. I tried listening to some of his others and the quality was bad on them too. It is so sad because his is some of the greatest meditation music there is.
4,Queen's Jewels still shine the brightest,"Fantastic box-set for fans and newcomers alike, contains the first eight albums from the Brit rockers, with a wide variety of musical styles and instruments. A few noticable omissions, for example the lack of bonus CD containing Hollywood Records' own remixes, but otherwise a good buy!"
5,"Queen is timeless, Queen is perfection, Queen rocks...","I am a Queen fan, since the first time I listened to ""Crown Jewels"" I have been in a state of awe. From ""Keep Yourself Alive"" to ""Save Me"", Queen made a rock 'n roll roller coaster that keeps you mesmerized and completely blown away. With every hit (except ""Flash"") from ""Greatest Hits 1"",(Gold) and much, more, it has appeal for the Queen fan that only knows Bohemian Rhapsody, all the way up to the biggest Queen fan ever. Words cannot describe why you should buy this box set, if you like rock or not it is worth what it costs. I encourage you to buy Queen, start small, or believe me and get ""Crown Jewels"", but if you only know the greatest hits, you are handicapping your enjoyment of music.(for me, life) It changed my life, it will changes yours, trust me on this, Queen is timeless, Queen is perfection, Queen rocks."
4,Queen,"Great boxed set. Dark Blue velvet box with logo. ""nice"" Each CD is in an carboard replica jacket of it's album. It would've been a perfect set if the CD's were in an hard case instead of cardboard.8 CD's and a companion booklet with all the lyrics and some pictures.If you like Queen's music this is a great collection. I love it."
5,An Overview Of One Of The Greatest Rock Bands Of All Time!,"Without belaboring the point, let me just say that few groups have had the influence and the wide-reaching fame of Queen. This boxed set contains their first 8 studio albums remastered, in minature versions of their original packaging (except for 'The Game'. Why?). You'll find all their hits up to 1980, with great tracks like ""Keep Yourself Alive"", ""Killer Queen"", ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", ""Tie Your Mother Down"", ""We Are The Champions"", ""Fat Bottomed Girls"", and ""Another One Bites The Dust"". You're better off buying this set rather than each one individually. These do not contain the horrible remixes added to the individual CDs. Queen was a band that proved that rock could be much more than just three chords and a backbeat. You can see their influence in so many artists these days, from Metallica to Spacehog. Grab this and see why."
2,A Brush With Nature,"Since there are not to many product details. I get lost with the title, I thought it teach you how to use the brushes in painting,unfortunately there are only faded color drawings inside this book.I made a mistake buying this book."
5,One of my Top Ten Favorite Books,"I have never read a book twice, but I read this one twice. The first time I read this book was in 1987. I later read ""The Spy Wore Silk"" and ""The Spy Went Dancing"". I loved them all, but The Spy Wore Red is my favorite. I just recently read this book again (May 2002), and really enjoyed it more the second time around. The book is fast paced, never boring, and a real page turner. It is hard to believe this is a true story. I would love to meet the Countess of Romanones Aline. She has to be one of the most fascinating women in history. I highly suggest reading it - you will not be disappointed."
2,So where's the Blu-ray Version?,"I love this group and the movie is awesome, but I want to hear and watch in 1080p Dolby Surround and its not available, when when. I'm at least glad that Ray is finally out on Blu-Ray"
2,Temptations,I'm a little dissapointed the movie came in two parts and I didn't know it was going to be that way
1,Greatest Miniseries Ever,I found the video very heart touching to the point that you could not help feeling sorry for people like Paul Williams and David Ruffin. I grew up in the Temptation era and would never had thought that things went down like they did. I must say that I thought I was getting the unedited version since I missed it on tv. I echo the sentiments of other in that I wish it would come back on tv.
4,Great!!,"This is a story of one of the groups that formed what we call music today. If you love music, saddness, joy, heartbreak...just being human...you will love this movie"
4,Some great songs,"If you want to hear some good tunes and see a good movie then here you go. This film also showes how the Music Business will take you, chew you up and spit you out if you let it."
4,even edited it's still EXCELLENT,"When the movie premiered on t.v., I was only able to tape the second half. I loved it and have watched this half over and over again. I bought the video thinking I would be seeing the whole movie. I blew my stack to see that scenes were cut out. I watched it again to make sure I wasn't seeing things. Don't get me wrong, this movie even edited is still EXCELLENT.Here are just some of the scenes cut from the video: The scene where David and Tammy are at the picnic. The scene where Paul was singing at the party. The scene where Otis and his son visit Paul at his home to see how he was doing. The scene where Eddie visits David at his condo (where David offers Eddie his opinion among other things). And the scene where David visits Eddie performing at a night club and they both sing ""You're my Everything"" (I love that scene).Worth every penny? Yes. You will not be disappointed. I would love a copy of the full t.v. version. I'm at: terri5868@go.com"
3,Lost in Translation,"After watching the VH1 movie and the DVD, the VHS leaves out some important aspects of this wonderful documentry. Not that it's not something everyone should have in their collection, but if important scenes are taken out, like when David Ruffin is telling the other Tempatations about his home life and feeling being apart of the group is the first thing he's ever been apart of in his life while sitting at the kitchen table, or going back to the south for the first time after segregation and seeing the ropes down that separated the blacks from the whites and how it made them all feel being from the south to witness this event, it looses a lot in the translation of the essence of partnership. The VHS should be in Full length as seen in the VH1 Movie and the DVD. I find that is the only draw back of it.Respectfully,Ms. Jackson"
2,temptations,I enjoyed the movie but the movie has a second disc that I was not aware so I only got to enjoy half the movie very disappointed. There was nothing stating that it had a second disc it seemed like a bootleg CD that was not quite complte.
4,I laughed out loud,I stumble across this show recently and order the seasons to catch up. It's funny and the service and delivery was great.
5,Dopeness,All y'all suckaz sleepin' on the mobb betta fall back before you get your wig pushed back so fast you won't know you're hit...Really tho this album is dope and Alc always comes correct on the beats.
2,Jazz oriented CD with boring DVD,This is double CD--one is a DVD showing the musicians discussing each song with interviews--This is the Allman Bros bass player's jazz group with a fairly decent lead singer on 5 of the 11 cuts--this is mostly jazz music with some guitar solos --I find this CD boring for the most part ... Allman Bros lovers I would think would be disappointed -its fair at best-too much jazz feeling here-no out and out rock n roll. I have a copy and will sell or trade it soon-it does not have to be in my collection.
3,moderately everything,"...The love story is moderately pleasing, the sex is moderately hot, the premise is moderately original. The book needed proofreading and editing in a big way. This book is on my keep shelf for now and I have re-read it but it will go one of these days and I will forget it quickly."
5,Great Piece,Best gift I could have gotten my wife. It was a good price for Nambe as well and it showed up quick.
3,has its strong and weak points,"This is a rather lightweight but well constructed pedal. I have used it with a Roland Juno Stage. It works well for triggering effects such as the rotating speaker effect. The downfall of this pedal is that when used as a Volume pedal, it provides a Very limited range of volume; not enough to be practically useful. I replaced it with a Yamaha FC-7 pedal, which provides an excellent volume range, and is an even more solidly constructed unit."
1,"Product doesn't work, seller won't make it right","Received item very quickly and in good condition but it is defective. Seller refuses to replace item with working one and insists on buyer using the manufacturer's warranty procedure, requiring additional cost and excessive time. I don't recommend buying from this seller."
3,"Repetetive, synthetic music.","There are a lot of flaws with in this music. For one thing, it uses a lot of synthesized sounds, and synthesizer technology in 1987 wasn't that great. The real problem is that it's repetitive. On David Lanz's website it says that this was written as background for a nature movie. You can tell. Eagle's Path has a melody that I think is really, really annoying, but maybe that's just me. When I try to listen to this and focus on the music, I get bored in a few minutes and pick up a book. Defitely the weakest Lanz album."
2,What's the point?,"Students who are concerned with learning the conventions of the legal community are best advised to use the bluebook. Employers -- law firms, courts, etc. -- overwhelmingly use the bluebooks and *expect* you to have a working familiarity with it. To the extent that this book supplements and explains the bluebook, all the more power to it, but I think that the bluebook is fairly self-explanatory and most of the nuance varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In my view, legal writing instructors are doing a disservive to their students by pawning this as *the alternative* when not a single federal court of major law review uses it!"
2,"Had the potential, but...","I had purchased this through BB to replace the other Samsung combo unit that was NOT a recorder, as the VCR would ""eat"" the tapes (until you FFed past about a 10-minute mark).Not compatible with my Philips 32"" flat. When watching DVD's, it intermittently flashes snow, blue screen, and black screen when using HDMI connection. I checked cables and the usual troubleshooting, and it was not happy at any point. Will be returning it."
2,"Great features, buy major quality problems","I won't comment on the features here, as many others have done a great job. Just to mention that I've had significant quality problems with this product. The first one I received from Amazon stopped opening/closing the disc tray all together after 1 day. The second one I received worked ok for 2 months, and then all the buttons on the unit itself stopped working (now I can only control the unit from the remote.) Also, when copying VCR to DVD, all my copies have significant distortion on the lower 3-5% of the screen. This might be workable if I were just trying to watch the DVD ... but since I bought this unit to allow me to transfer VHS to DVDs and get rid of my old tapes ... I'm not willing to have my best memories stored with 5% distortion."
4,samsung dvd-vr357 dvd & vcr combo recorder,"I have done some recording to dvd from vcr tapes and am happy with the results. However I am still unable to record from tv in either mode (vcr or dvd). This unit is like all other units on the market, a bear to hook up properly. With corp. greed they don't want to make it easy to be able to copy and keep what you can do on a low level. It would be so nice to have instructions for fast and one time hookup. Today will be about the sixth attempt to hook it up properly. Pull the tv etc. out of the display cab., restring wires etc. What a pain. Wish me luck, Roger. Oh by the way this is a fine unit and other than hookup it is great, would advise purchase."
2,Beware!,"I went through decent checks including the review here, the productspecs listed here, the specs listed at Best Buy, and bought thissucker only to discover that it is TUNERLESS. If you do straight cableor antenna connections, ferget it!Pain in the rear! Tunerless status is in fine print on the carton - Ididn't see it."
2,DVD burning died after 13 months,"Samsung DVD-VR357 Tunerless DVD Recorder and VCR ComboMine was purchased from Sams over a year ago. The VCR works flawlessly and is heavily used by my technphobe housemate. I recorded a lot of TV using DVD+RW and DVD-RAM. I also used the DVD to play content burned on various computer DVD burners (all LG) to DVD+RW, DVD+R and DVD-RAM. The VR357 was very good about drilling through folders. I just did my first VCR-DVD direct transfer. The quality was exceptional. After that first success the DVD recorder is suddenly toast. I can no longer format or initialize my DVD-RWs or DVD-RAMs. DVD-RWs become corrupt and DVD-RAMs cause the machine to POWER OFF!!!I am purchasing a replacement from a well known retailer, refurbished. Perhaps it will run longer. I loved it while it worked."
5,Samusng Delivers Again,"My Go Video unit finally gave out, and since they are essentially out of business (and the cost of a repair was more than a new one would cost), I decided to give this one a try. It not only cost far less than the other one, but seems to work better. It's a bit tricky trying to figure out how to work it -- the auto copy doesn't seem to work as well as setting it up onscreen -- but overall, I am delighted with it."
3,Remote is difficult to read,"I was able to connect the DVD player quite easily and it works well. However, the remote control is very difficult to read and use. The buttons are very small and they are all the same color. It is not something you can use in a dim light. I feel it could have easily been made more consumer friendly."
1,Don't buy this one,"It won't play several of my DVDs. I didn't realize it at first because the first few DVDs that I happened to choose to play worked fine. It was only a few months after I purchased it that I saw that it wouldn't play many of my other DVDs including many from Disney.The fact that is also tunerless led to some complications in my multiple TV household since I have DishTV (satellite). One receiver controls two TVs, so I can only attach this to the TV that connected directly to the receiver. It also means that many advanced features are not available, like recording one source while watching another and PIP. I am very, very disappointed with this product."
1,Pointless,"This 'film' is a complete waste of time and money. The models are fine, the production is fine if unimaginative, so what? Boring, boring, boring."
5,A Great Find,Tom Bianchi is at his best with the filming of the photo book. Any fan of erotic will love this title.
2,This book has an essential flaw,Message to the managers: in my previous review I erroneously gave 5 stars (I did not notice this default setting). I'd like to give 2 stars instead. Please revise my review accordingly! Thanks a lot.
2,My review,"ok so this product is really tiny and you dont get much sound out of it compared the the normal sized ones. if i had known how small this thing was i would have bought a bigger one. the inside of the doumbek does not really look nice, looks like aspestos on your ceiling"
3,"Same cookie cutter, but still cute","Okay, same story line, rich person gets too comfortable, someone else is running the show, makes mistakes, rich person has to have a reality check and fix the world and everyone is better off because of it. It was still a cute movie. Suggest you watch, but don't buy."
3,Sound Familiar?,"Although i've heard it was a good movie, it sounds very similar to the Disney Channel Original Movie ""Cow Belles"" starring Aly and Aj. That already turns me off of it. i have to admit, Hilary is a good acctress, but i can't stand how she has 3 albums and she can't even sing for real! However, it looked funny, and i would like to go see it. all my friends who have seen it say that it is good so i give it 3 1/2 stars."
3,Product needs to have more sizing info,Product was too small for my application. It seems to be a common complaint on these from all the manufactures that the sizing is missing or misled. I was able to use it but only after almost snapping it in two. Came in a bag with no information on it. How do I know they sent me the right one??
3,Very small...,"The fish is very nice, detail is great, however, it is unfortunately very small... I returned it and got Swarovski instead."
2,"THEY MAY SAY ITS ""NEW"" from AMAZON BUT ITS NOT","I purchased this book from amazon with the free shipping, the book is suppose to be NEW but the corner of this hardcover book was torn off, some ""new"" book. What a joke."
3,For the canada goose fan,This is a rather slow gentle retelling of a scientists journey with geese in his neighboring pond and one little goose he raises from hatching. It was helpful in understanding some of the goose behavior.
5,Into The Unknow : The Remarkable Life of Hans Kraus,"What a life Doctor Hans Kraus lived. His climbing and medical accomplishments are amazing and Schwartz has given us a wonderful look into his life. If you are a climber, have back pain, enjoy presidential history, or love a great story you need to read this book."
2,A Snoozer,Predictable ending - I kept hoping there would be some great twist at the end and it never happened :(
2,Too predictable,I was quite disappointed with this book - you can guess the culprit within the first 50 pages.
3,implausible,"I enjoyed reading the book as I read it, but after 'who done it' was revealed, I realized that he not only was nuts, but he must have been bad at his job. I hadn't figured it out because it was implausible. SPOILER ALERT Surely a police officer who wanted to make someone pay for something in her past would soon switch from thinking about murdering her to framing her for something. That would be a lot more punishment than a quick strangulation and a lot easier to pull off as well, given his occupation. Plus he should have known that committing more crimes makes a person more likely to be caught, rather than less likely."
4,good starter table,"I searched everywhere on line for a foose ball table for my son for his birthday, as we live over-seas, and alot of places wouldn't ship such a large item to me. I was grateful to find this one and he loves it! His friends do too, and I think with it on the floor, it is more comfortable for them to play with it. It is made well, and arrived in great condition. This is a good starter table."
1,Trash,"This book's attempts to teach anything do anything but teach. Each section has about ten pages of explanation followed by a bunch of problems. Unfortunately the explanations do anything but explain to people that are trying to learn math. If you're a math wiz you might be able to decrypt what they're talking about, but as a student I had no idea. In the examples the authors often use explanations such as ""it is obvious that..."" and ""we remember from..."" The lack of explanation (mainly laziness on the authors' part) makes it very hard to follow what they're talking about, and the problems afterwards often expect the reader to know things that weren't discussed or appeared as a one-sentence blurp in the margin. So unless you're a massochist or already know this stuff like the back of your hand and need a reference guide, spend your money someplace else."
1,not a good product...do not purchase,These lashes are not what they appear in ad. They are false and look false and do not stay aligned with lash line.
3,Needs to come in black!,"This hat looks quite cute, but needs to come in colors other than red! Black, white, chocolate brown,or cream colored would do nicely! Haven't purchased this hat yet...but I would in another color!Red hats are simply dreadful on redheads dearies, one either contrasts badly or loses drama from matching too much! Simply not cricket!"
3,The Society,"A nice beginning. I wasn't thrilled with the semi cliffhanger ending which she has a tendency to do with her books. I like the way she fully integrates the world as a just slightly different from what we have now. There is enough ""normal"" world so you aren't trying to figure out all the different in's and out's of the world itself that you miss the well written plot and character development that she is so good at. Overall its a good book, so far the second one is just as good but since I haven't finished it I don't know if these are the only books in this series.Overall a good read, with well developed character's and character development in a world easy enough to fall into step with and find yourself Believing in this slightly altered reality."
2,Listed as wrong year,"I bought this movie to do a school project on recent films. There wasn't much info about this movie on the internet, so I trusted the listing when it said 2008. This movie is NOT from 2008; it's from the 1980s. I suppose it's mostly my fault, but the listing should be updated to include the release date of the movie, not just the DVD release date."
5,Saint's Extraordinaire,"An awesomely educational book about the lives of both male and female Saints in the ancient and not so ancient days of the Catholic Church. Not to promote Catholicism, I am Protestant, but the book is a good read for all of the little girls who have a long way to go in life and uplift and encouragement are necessary."
5,Excellent!,This book is informative as well as entertaining. It makes you feel like you are there at the Battle of Bull Run.
2,Turned into a pumpkin after one year!,"Worked great until the one year mark and died a hard death. Inside is a Western Digital WD1600JS SATA HD (Caviar SE), this drive has a high failure rate so you might want to spend the extra money and get a Seagate."
1,EIGHTEEN MONTHS--AND GOODBYE,"I bought this drive as a brand-new, sealed box item, and used it infrequently for 18 months, with no real problems. Five days ago, it began emitting random sequences of two to 10 ""click"" sounds, several times a day. And today, it died, with all the files that once resided upon it just ... --vanishing. I'd give it an ""R.I.P."", if I didn't think that it's hardly unreasonable to expect a significantly longer lifespan for a major peripheral like this; I mean, 18 MONTHS? C'MON! Apparently, Western Digital is a junk peddler. (Indeed, now that I think of it, the unit actually has a junky ""feel"" to it; cheap plastic, flimsy construction, and all.) Buyer beware."
3,Disappointing and repetitive,"I listened to the clips before deciding to purchase this CD and was looking forward to getting a selection on par with ""Valley in the Clouds"" and ""In the Wake of the Wind"". I was very disappointed. The only song that stands out as slightly different is ""The Journey Home"". The rest are a blur of sameness. If you like 49 minutes of monotonous surreal music with chanting voices with songs sounding almost the same - ""Dream Palace"" is for you. There are many better Narada selections including the two mentioned above. Will not keep."
5,Joe Budden - Mood Music (The Worst Of Joe Buddden),The only thing I dont like about this CD is the fact that DJ OnPoint won't stop talkin on Budden's vocals...The Songs are tight...but this is basically a mixtape...I would've prefered this being an advance album of The Growth...
1,Boring - Not a true album; Mixtape material,"First off, do not be fooled. This is not an album it is a mixtape. Bernard buddens was axed from all major labels after his poor selling debut album. As a result, he tried to pass this offas an album. Cant fool me. Not 1 song is listenable. His voice is altered via machine. No cohesiveness. boring, bland."
4,Buy this!,"I'm a fan of Aranza, loved the title track, the other songs are really good too. I bought the cd here on amazon when it was a little cheaper, totally worth it!"
4,good but lacking some great songs,"I love The Stranglers and basically these are not thier greatest songs, altho this is the only one I was able to find ""Always the Sun"".This album is missing Dead Los Angeles, Baroque Bordello, Ugly, Don't Bring Harry, The Man They Love to Hate, Nuclear Device, and more! They were such a great band and this is not their greatest. you dont get a taste of their great sense of humor as in the song Ugly.You basically have to get The Raven, Rattus Norvegicus, La Folie, and Aural Sculptures to get the best of the Stranglers. This is a drag because altho I have all the cassetes including Black and White, the tape is starting to stretch, so now I have to get them on CD's."
4,"For misogynists, they make pretty good music!","I knew very little about the Stranglers, except for the downloaded copy of ""Peaches"" that I had been playing on constant rotation. (A great feat considering my ultra-feminist status.) I took a leap of faith, and went ahead and bought it. This is defintely a good buy for Stranglers fans, and it had some really good songs. There are one or two of them that I couldn't stand, though. (But, it was only $10.00, so I was happy.) Bottomline: If you have $10.00 to throw around, go ahead and buy it. If you want to get something you're 100% sure you'll like, look for something else."
4,"Over all, a very well written, but slightly biased, biography of Maximilian II","Just finished reading this book and I will say it is a very nice quality book, well laid out, extremely well foot-noted, and over all, quite good. There is a nice lead into Maximilian's life with plenty of background on his father, Ferdinand, and plenty of information on Ferdinand II as well. It's obvious an extreme amount of research went into this work and the author's writing style is pleasant and not overly-scholarly as many books of this nature tend to be. My only misgiving is that I believe the author sells Maximilian a bit short - it seems throughout the book that, for whatever reason, there is an axe to grind with the Hapsburg empire and in particular with Max II. If you're interested in German or Austrian history during the Renaissance, however, I doubt you'll find a much better book than this, so I would definitely recommend picking up a copy while you still can."
3,Disappointed but satisfied,"I bought this product to be used at my wedding as a centerpiece. I was excited to have found the product for a reasonable price and the picture looked great. I had previously rented a similar item from a party rental store for more than what I actually paid in addition to a deposit. This was more affordable and I would be able to use it for other occasions. Unfortunately, I was disappointed when it DID NOT FUNCTION AT ALL. Luckily, I was able to contact the manufacturer (RIVAL--1 year warranty)and although they were unable to replace the product due to no longer being made or refund my money, they did give me a replacement product of my choice."
1,Running for Cover...running from this book.,"Perhaps having been a fan of Donna Summer's for 25 years and having met her twice now, the information provided has revealed nothing new in this book. One major feeling generated though was how determined and driven she was to be heard and how creative she was to reach millions a whole decade before Madonna. The last few chapters seemed to condense the recent past two decades cheating the readers of how much Donna Summers' voice and music has grown and how it continues to get stronger and better like a fine wine over time. The major criticism is the authors subjective opinions and attack on Donna Summer's image and physical appearance as well as her appearance in print, film/television,and album covers. I felt it inappropriate and offensive to it's readers and fans. I know Donna's fans young and mature look forward to her own story due out later this year...perhaps readers should wait for that book than waste money on such a limited read."
1,"Errors, errors, and more errors!","This book at one time was good I am told, but the 8th edition (2002) is now outdated with many errors. The CD on heart sounds which is included is insulting to medical students. The book has terrible photographs which make the patients look jaundiced or cyanotic. I am sorry I bought it. There is no question that Swartz's book on physical diagnosis is the best. Swartz has a great free CD on the complete physical exam which is included with the book."
2,Still looking for a good physical exam book,This book was written for no one in mind. It reads as a single run-on sentence from page one to the end. You cannot learn physical exam from it (or from any other book -- you simply have to practice) and Bates is a rather mediocre reference if you need to find out how to examine this or that.Physical exam is a dying art and I'm yet to find a semi-decent modern text on the subject.
2,Disappointing and One Sided,"I'm sympathetic to this film's point of view but it fails on multiple levels. First and foremost it's completely one-side and is therefore basically propoganda. This leads to it's second flaw - the one-side rant become tiresome. Instead of an interesting debate you're left with a ""we know we're right"" smugness. It's a shame because I was fascinated, educated and alarmed by how secret the MPAA is and how powerful it is - but by failing to let the other side speak, their points lack legitimacy. Since clearly someone could have been found to intelligently articulate the other side, we're left to wonder why we're not allowed to make up our own minds. As a liberal myself, I find this the movie is one of those indicators that proves - if you follow the political spectrum far enough in either direction, you discover the spectrum is circular."
4,Good stuff,"Though it feels sometimes more like a TV show than a feature, this movie does a great job at presenting its case. The message is simple: the MPAA has a monopoly on everyone's first impression of a movie, and they are not the best or the fairest people for the job. Since they veil themselves in secrecy, the documentarian hunts them down to reveal who's in charge of determining what's appropriate for movie audiences."
4,"Excellent approach , easily grasped definitions",I have a web development and hosting team that has been employing all the latest technology and techniques to the industry. To find a quick reference to a large body of information is essential to productivity. So I was pleasantly surprised to find the text and definitions in this book so comprehensive yet easily grasped. I have found it a convenient source for CSS and Scripting characteristics. Because of the simplicity of explantions I would recommend it even to beginners of HTML and it's associative parts.
4,Impress friends ...,"... with this EXTREMELY smooth yet hoppin' seminal dance CD. Rarely does a deejay get everything right on the same record, but Louis does here. A deep dish of Chicago house music: lush, rich and ambient. You can dance around to it or just put it on and let the mood take you over. Faves are ""Reason,"" ""Saved My Life,"" and the superb ""New Dance Beat."""
2,NOT A COMEDY,"I don't know why this is called a ""comedy"" on the box, nor do I see the Woody Allen aspect of this film. Bittersweet is a very apt description for this slow paced movie. Abe goes to the big city to find his wife Kitty. He hires a detective, Jack to find her. During the movie we find out that she dumped Abe because his life was as boring as this film. Kitty is living with a rock star. During the course of the week Abe and Jack become friends and come to terms with their life in its current state (yawn). The guy who printed ""comedy"" on the cover owes me $2.00. The acting was acceptable and even good at times, but didn't compensate for a very dull script."
5,I love this cd,The mystical qualities of this cd are wonderful when I am working on my clients. It helps to take away the daily stresses of life and allows them and me to enjoy the time we spend together. I am an Ayurvedic esthetician.
3,Great story,"It ended too fast for me though. After reading the struggle of the two main characters, they finally admit to being in love and clear up misunderstandings, it ends. I wanted to read more about what happens to the mistress. But all in all a good read."
3,It's okay but...,"I ordered 3 t-shirt books (i'm a crafting maniac) and this was the most disappointing of the bunch. I would highly recommend Tease ed. Sarah Sockit or Generation T by megan nicolay which are much more inspiring. Not only are they better, the instructions are much more clear! This book has very minimal instructions and instead of actual pictures, they use fashiony illustrations which don't really convey how they'd look on a real person. The book itself is nice--spiral bound and small with an arresting orange cover but I gotta say the content is just not as good as the others. Like the other person said, there are a lot of tiny, backless tops. This book won't be useful unless you have a small frame and don't mind wearing shirts without a bra!"
3,Not entirely my favorite,Some of the designs are interesting but the directions are sometimes vague. If you can infer some construction plans from the sketches I think you'll be fine but as a whole there are a few more clearly written books likeGeneration T: 108 Ways to Transform a T-Shirt. Also most of these designs aren't built so that you can wear a bra with them (for you modest crafters).
3,snippers beware,"The designs in this book certainly are creative and unique enough to make you think twice about trashing your vintage tees - but most of these projects are terribly impractical. There are no patterns, no mention of measurements(such as what size shirt will be needed to pull off the design or what size the shirt will end up being) and the instructions are vague. The entire book is illusrated, which suggests that the shirts may not work on 'real bodies' or that the results are not appealing enough to photograph. Without the use of elastics or zippers, I have to wonder how some of these shirts stay where they are supposed to. However, my biggest warning to potential readers and crafters is this: unraveling! Despite the eco-conscious message the book gives about recycling clothing, many of these designs are not built to last. Without finishing the cut edges with hems or tape, they are bound to roll up, tear, or unravel within a few washes."
2,Not a Classic,"I bought this book for my younger sister because she's always wanting to cut her t-shirts up and change them (with guidance). I thought that this might be a good guide for her, but I was pretty disappointed when I received it. Although spiral bound, which is nice, it lacks clear, concise instructions on how to create the t-shirts. There isn't a single ""classic"" design, the designs are too similar, and there are no actual photos of the designs, either. Not recommended (and especially not for beginners)."
1,"Bad designs, few instructions","The WORST t-shirt restyle book I've seen. There are a lot of ideas here, but many are unwearable if you are over 25 or weigh over 100 pounds or need to wear a bra, and some would be awkward even then. Part of the problem is the concept doesn't lend itself to so many designs; The only materials they allow for each project are one tee, scissors, thread & needle. I understand not everyone has vintage brooches or silk ties lying around to revamp a tee, but I think adding a second tee or ribbon or shoestrings would help a lot. The problem is that they have to cut these items out of the shirt in one place to add them in another, so you wind up with things that are heavily layered in the front and have no back, drawstrings cut in a spiral from a circular cutout, etc., which is what makes some designs awkward. Some of the designs cannot be saved by adding materials-they're simply unattractive. I'd look elsewhere for inspiration."
1,Wow. That sucked.,Well lets just say you be very angry after paying any money to see this movie. It has terrible acting and a even worse plot. I don't think I could be paid to watch it again. Huge disappointment.
3,reasonable suspense movie,"While the Wicker Man may not be the best of Nicolas Cage's movies, I generally enjoyed watching it. There was a decent amount of suspense present during the entire time and I finished watching until the end without getting bored too often; I'm not familiar with the ""original"" version, I didn't know what was supposed to happen, and definitely didn't expect this outcome so the abrupt ending took me by surprise. This movie is not a masterpiece, but solid 3 - 3 1/2 stars are fair.I'm expecting getting many ""non helpful"" votes (if any at all) for this short evaluation, but I don't care. There are much worse movies out there, often rated unreasonably high, and I feel that Wicker Man doesn't deserve such a poor rating as presented by most reviewers around here, and even by the Amazon's own editorial review."
1,Pointless,"This is actually a well put together movie, but, the whole thing winds up being pointless when all the build-up over approximately an hour and a half comes to an anticlimactic ending with no reason as to why any of it happened and certainly no closure on any of the questions you will have. If you have seen this movie, you already know. If you watch this movie, you will feel empty when you see the ending."
1,Oh I hated this movie...,"Most of the time, I am able to see some redeeming value in a movie. There is, after all, a great deal of time and energy that goes into making a film. The Wicker Man (this version at least) is one of those movies that I can honestly say has ZERO redeeming value. It is horrible, and far surprasses the category of ""so bad it's good."""
2,Mediocre suspense horror movie,"I saw the movie recently with some old friends. After seeing this movie, I learned this was a re-make, the original came out in 1973. Overall, the movie was lousy.The scenes of scariness from the movie's TV commercials have little relevence to the plot. Several critics have given this movie bad reviews. While there are some believable aspects, (e.g. cell phone not working on a distant island), there are still plot holes. While Nicholas Cage has done some great movies in the past, his acting in this one is not up to par. There are a few decent moments, but the movie is rather pathetic.Overall, save your money. There are better suspense movies than this one..."
1,Terrible!,"We rented this because my wife and I have liked N. Cage in a number of movies.This was terrible! Should be subtitled ""Let's All Go to the Human Sacrifice!"""
2,poor remake....,"When I had read they were remaking the wicker man and saw some of thetrailers I was mildly interested. I rented it on DVD last evening andwas surprised at how tame this version was considering all the wackinessof the original could have made for an interesting remake but not here.Wooden performances all over, just not enough of anything to make thiseither scarey, thrilling or memorable. Its watchable because it will beconsidered a classic in dimwitted filmaking years from now, just couldhave been so much better with a little crazy sex thrown in or some nudedance wildness as in the original, nothing here, lame."
2,"Don't go to an island full of crazies, without backup","Nicolas Cage just didn't stand a chance once he landed on that island (Summersisle) off Washington State, full of wackos. I just tried to think how he was going to overcome all those ""forces"" against him, but to no avail. This movie does not have a happy ending. Unlike a lot of other horror movies, the hero just doesn't survive this one. If you're the type who roots for the ""good guy(s)"" in horror movies, this one isn't for you. Cage, as police officer Edward Malus is out of his league (an in definite need of a SWAT team) against this island of matriarchal pagan zealots; in the search for his missing daughter."
1,Get out the gas masks,"I'd give this movie half of a half of a star (if I could).I was watching it on HBO, and I was laughing too much to turn it off. Reading some of these reviews, I laughed even more. This movie deserves every bad review it gets.Nicolas Cage looks like a fool in this. Anyone in their right mind would have been on the island for a few hours and take off running. He acts like a one-man army, and all of the actors in The Wicker Man should be wondering if they just needed the money.So many scenes in this movie are so lame that it is embarassing. Often, it can make you crack up instead of sitting on the edge of your seat.Like most of the other bad reviews here, I would agree--don't bother. I say don't bother with this movie unless you want to see an accidental comedy (instead of good thriller)."
2,wicker man,I did not like the movie.... It was predictable and I only continued to watch it because I had nothing else to do. Wish I hadn't.
1,Doesn't even deserve 1 star...,"I've seen quite a few bad movies in my life, but I can honestly say this one is the WORST. Laughable, incoherent, digusting, insulting, there aren't enough adjectives to accurately portray the extent of this movie's failure. I've never seen the original, and I went into this movie having never even read a plot summary. Afterwards I wish nothing more than to purge this utter nonsense from my mind. Avoid this joke of a movie for the sake of your own intellect; I would pay to have not seen it."
1,"God, Dear God, Help me. NO, NOOO","Awful is not the right word, it does not give this ""movie"" justice enough. Too bad you can not give movies a 0 star rating. Stay away, Stay FAR away."
2,Avoid like the plague!,"This film is awful! It has got to be one of the worst remakes in recent memory. The acting is awful (was Nicolas Cage short on cash or drunk when he read this script and agreed to be in this film?) It lacks just about everything of the original, the inhabitants of the island have suddenly become some sort of Celtic feminist fundamentalists, Nicolas Cage is so anoying throughout the film by the end of it you are almost siding with the locals to having him burned at the stake. This film is awful in every way.Do yourself a favour and buy/rent the original, block this one out of your mind and pretend it was never made."
1,wicker man? let's try wicker SHAM!!!,"I never thought a movie about a traveling yard furniture salesman would strike box office gold and boy was i RIGHT.to be honest, i think i followed it pretty well until that little girl in need of some serious personal therapy and AN ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT showed up and i was like ""whoa???!"" i thought this was a family flick!! (let's just say grandma mills was NOT happy with me for bringing her to that one-- good thing she only paid for the popcorn...!!)SERIOUSLY, nic cage, what happened???!!!!stick to what you know: film classics like: peggy sue got married, the family man, and city of angels. you're a die-hard romantic, and that's what your fans love!!!give us those tear-jerkers, nicky! it's what ya do best..."
3,Haven't seen the original...,"I didn't see the original with Edward Herrmann, so I have no basis for comparison. What I did notice throughout was a direct rip-off of Nicholas Roeg's '73 ""Don't Look Now"", with an equally disappointing end for our hero. The sad thing is that where Roeg used style and focus, this film seems wrought with silly masks and over-acted hysteria. I didn't hate it as much as the others did, but I'm definitely going to seek out the original. Yes, the acting was pretty bad and unbelievable, though I liked Diane Delano (a Kathy Bates look-alike), and Leelee Sobieski's fine talents were badly wasted. This remake also reminded me a lot of Shyamalan's ""The Village"", though, again, it lacked style. Director Neil Labute is a talented man, but this one is best forgotten."
3,"Sturdy knife, but sticks to soft cheeses","An okay knife for semi soft and medium cheeses, but crushes soft cheeses and sticks.....Try the cheese knife that Amazon sells that is made of a special resin/plastic..it is amazing, see my review for that one!"
5,Very Good family show,"My family enjoys the Waltons, and this season came with all the discs as it should. We certainly like to see these old family favorites."
5,Thank-you!,"Thank-you for the good quality of the item and it has arrived in good packaging! I will be ordering more from you, thanks again."
3,Where's the DVD???,"I have loved this movie ever since I first saw it back in the early 80's. I've seen it so many times I can recite dialogue . I was sorely disappointd when i finally got a VHS copy and found that things were missing-not exactly neccessary things -but it's still not the complete film. I would have thought that the releasing of George Cukor's LAST film would would garner more respect. After all, he's directed Kate Hepburn. And this is just the kind of character driven comedy that she would have been great in in her time.Jacqueline Bisset and Candace Bergen make this movie work because you really believe these two people are the friends they portray.And under Cukor's direction, the friendship ebbs and flows as most friendships do-and have to-in order to be better.If they can release DVD versiions of lesser known and surely lesser quality movies, then WHY can't the studio release a DVD version of the FULL film. I will be awaiting patiently."
3,Great pickin' but mumbling,"The interplay of the instrumentalists is superb, with a jazz-like fluidity at times, and it's a reminder that Jack Casady has never received his due as a bassist. But as a shot at a definitive document of the band, there are two problems: No ""Death Don't Have No Mercy"" and Jorma mumbles his way through most of the vocals, including, shockingly, ""I Know You, Rider."""
1,Who cares?,"Not only did I not care about any of the characters or what happend to them, but I can't even imagine how anyone else could, especially nominators of the Pulizter Prize. I don't get it. I didn't care about Frank's little narrow life with his pretentious tone. He was insincere with everyone he related to. He fit the realtor stereotype quite well (nothing against realtors). His son was a typical weird 15 year old with no depth to him. His daughter was contrived and Frank didn't seem to really care much about her--though he tried to make it seem he did (same with his son, for that matter). Cliche plot with predictable, shallow characters. Blech."
3,An infuriating writing style,"I once had a plan to read every novel that has received the Pulitzer. After reading a few, I now realize what kind of book the Board loves: stories about American men past their prime and dealing with it. Rabbit is Rich and Rabbit at Rest. American Pastoral. And now Independence Day. I can't take it anymore. Plus, my goodness, the detail. Ford spends 50 pages on showing a house to a indecisive couple. Some masochists, ahem, readers, enjoy this writing style (e.g., Virginia Woolf), but I like stories that actually GO SOMEWHERE. So if you hated ""Mrs. Dalloway"", you'll hate Independence Day the way I did."
1,Booooorrrrrring!,"I can't believe I put myself through 450 pages. I don't care how many awards it won--it's one of the most boring things I've ever read. Contrary to the description on the back cover, there is no ""sudden bewildering engagement with life."" Nothing ever happens in this story, so don't read this novel expecting adventure or really any excitement at all."
4,Engrossing,"Not thinking I would like this book was an awful mistake on my part. It is eerily real, which is what makes it depressing, but simultaneously addicting. My other mistake was not reading The Sportswriter first (but so is the woe when you are trying to read all of the Pulitzer books and the first book doesn't win! )"
2,I tried..I really tried,"I got on the Pulitzer prize winning book kick after reading the unbelievably wonderful ""The Confederacy of Dunces."" ""Independence Day"" has just ended that kick. I managed to get all the way through it - but found ""blah blah blah"" resounding in my head through much of the narrative. Imagine your most boring relative telling you the same story over and over and over like their opinion on everything is so deep that you should be in awe. Now imagine you paid them to tell it to you...egads...there you have my opinion of this book. Great for insomnia."
3,"Awesome talent, wrong vehicle","Ford is an impresario of the thesaurus. He has an exceptional command of the turn of phrase and mood setting device. When Independence Day picks up steam, it's hip, smooth exploration of the ""Existence Period"" touches a nerve of at least one ""almost"" middle-aged reader. It's critique on superficial American culture draws inspiration from an appropriate New Jersey setting.Ultimately, however, the book is a train to ""nowhere."" The insightful exploration of state of mind and stage of life becomes redundant and ultimately tedious.The comments of others on this page should be helpful. It's certain that Ford's prodigious talent has found a less cumbersome corpus in which to shine - the short story recommendations sound promising. Otherwise, I must agree with those whose ask, what were those Pulitzer judges smoking?"
3,Tedious but well-written,"I suppose I will never belong to the self-proclaimed literati, because while I can appreciate the fact that this book is very well written, still I believe that that is not enough in itself to make it a great book - certainly not a Putlizer-Prize winner. Having never read the prequel to this book, it's possible I've missed something crucial that could have contributed to my enjoyment of Independence Day. But as it was, I found it to be tedious, often boring, and almost transparently ""deep"" - as if Ford was more concerned with waxing philosophical than with telling a compelling story. There are so many authors out there who can both write well and tell a compelling story, that Ford is hardly the first author I would turn to."
2,Not as listed,This was listed/advertised as an audiobook. It is NOT It is a regular paperback book. How do I get the audiobook?
3,Chilly!,"If anything, that book has taught me what I don't want to be when I grow up: an empty soul in search of an anchor of some sort. ""Independence Day"" served as a great kick in the butt, and I am thankful for that!"
3,Mediocre,"I've got to put this book right in the middle of the star spectrum only because it didn't stir any emotions on either side. Ford is undoubtedly a talented writer and blessed with a wonderful sense of humor, but the book was slow-paced and lacked the insight such a book needs in order to get away with the pace. Worth reading for Frank Bascombe's keen and witty observations, but ultimately, you won't come away with much."
2,Have I missed something?,"I hesitate to so hastily condemn a book that has won a Pulitzer prize and garnered so many favorable reviews from Amazon users. However, the question persists: have I missed something? Am I simply too young to understand what is going on? Was I supposed to identify with Bascomb? Could anybody? To compare such a cliche-ridden, tired piece of calculated Americana with the works of Updike and Irving seems to me nothing short of heresy. Great American Novel my left foot. Hmmph."
5,bah lover,This is the finest recording I have heardnof this unique and signature piece of J.S. Bach and is probably the best recording of it in existence
3,INAUSPICIOUS DEBUT BUT GOOD FOLLOWUP,"NOTE: This review is for the double album 10cc/TEN OUT OF TEN.The British ""bad boys"" debut album demonstrates their wacky lyrics and their general eccentricity. Tracks 1-4 are parodies of 50s teen angst ditties like DONNA, JOHNNY DON'T DO IT, etc. Tracks 5-7 are more eclectic including SPEED KILLS, a barrage of instruments vs. floating vocals---the instruments win! Tracks 8-9 are merely annoying cacophonies. FRESH AIR FOR MY MAMA, track 10, is vaguely reminiscent of I'M NOT IN LOVE, but not nearly as memorable. The album was a huge success in the UK and introduced them to some US playlists.Their 1981 ""comeback"" was TEN OUT OF TEN. This collection is more polished with more accessible tunes, including DON'T ASK, MEMORIES, DON'T TURN ME AWAY and the infectious NOTELL MOTEL.The album sadly flopped in the US, leaving us to remember 10cc for their two big US hits---I'M NOT IN LOVE and THINGS WE DO FOR LOVE."
1,poor quality,"Fast shipping, but very poor quality. I don't recommend this product to anyone. Save your money (although it is ver cheap) and time."
3,You get what you pay for,"They didn't register with my printer, after I gave up a day later it didn't seem to care. They print and leak, but I feel that for what was paid, I got that back and a little bit more. Not OE quality, but they work with some fuss."
2,you get what you pay for,Quick delivery. The black ink worked just fine as well as the the cyan. But the magenta and the yellow clogged a few minutes after installation. Should have spent the extra $$ and purchased authentic Brother ink cartridges!
1,simpley the worst,"DOESN'T WORK YOU DO BETTER BUYING A LOTTERY TICKET YOUR CHANCES OF WINNER IS BETTER THAN THE INK WORKING, WHAT A RIP OFF, I BOUGHT 4PACKS, HOW SMART IS THAT."
4,Contacted by seller and am satisfied.,"For the price of the cartridges, we are more than satisfied. The black works great. The colors are not the best but they work. For $5, we have no complaints."
2,Cheap.....doesn't work well,"I bought these thinking I could save some money, but I guess you get what you pay for. They are not very good at all."
2,Not sure......,"I am very happy to have my cheap little fax/printer/scanner working now that it has ink in it. This machine originally gave me rather nice color copies, considering it's a cheap little machine. I just tried another color copy of a photo, and the copy definitely has too much green in it. Therefore, I could not recommend this ink,if you want seriously nice color pix. Again, it could be my machine that's the problem causing the green overtones, I don't know. I am just very happy that I don't have to buy the expensive ink to make my printer machine work, so for me this cheap ink is wonderful."
2,Empty Cartridge,"The quality was as expected for the price I paid for it, so I wasn't too surprised about the lack of print quality. One of the black cartridges was pretty much empty, but I didn't bother sending it back."
5,was supposed to be released on march 10,"this was supposed to be out on march 10, then the date changed with no notification. might wanna steer clear of pre-ordering this one."
3,"See ""VHS"" - See ""Used""","Unless you've already pawned your vcr then pick up an old vhs, and try not to spend more than 10 bucks because two of the videos are shot from the same footage, one is heartbreakingly misguided, another is taken from 'aint it dead yet', and punctuating them are infuriatingly short soundless clips of what looks like a great live show."
