2,Don't depend on it for sturdiness,"As many others indicated in their reviews, this tripod uses very lightweight materials - aluminum and plastic. That makes for a very unsteady tripod. There are some convenience features, (the level which isn't accurate, the easy release) but none that make up for the fact that you will not get sturdiness from this tripod. I have a Sony DSLR that displays an icon when the shot will not be steady; when I use the camera with this tripod, I almost never get a Steady Shot indicator. I've had the tripod for a year and don't use it very often - when I do, it's mostly for setting up the camera waiting for wildlife to come along. This tripod does most of the job it's designed to do, except for the most important -- keeping the camera steady. Not recommended."
3,"Ok for non-professional, traveling or beginner","I read a lot of the reviews and wasn't sure what to expect from this tripod, so I decided to try it out for myself. I'm planning a trip so I wanted something that was easy to carry and lightweight. This tripod definitely offers that. It also has quite a few adjustments for such an inexpensive tripod.However, if you are serious about photography I would skip buying this. I tried it out on my Nikon d40 and found that the mounting plate doesn't screw in tightly (causing the camera to swivel when turned to a downward/upward position). I've used professional level tripods and they are definitely worth the money. If you're looking for something really sturdy and high quality I wouldn't really recommend getting this tripod."
5,Well Worth the Price,"This is a very inexpensive tripod. Nonetheless, it has everything you would need at this price point and works great for stationary photos, etc. Though I have no complaints, I'm an amateur photographer so I may not be the first one to ask about extreme details. In short, I realize it may not be made of the best materials, but it's far more than I would expect at this price."
2,Cheap Construction,You get what you pay for. The design and construction was flimsy and one of the legs came out on my first attempt to use it. If you have a heavy SLR camera then it can be very unstable on the head and you will not get very good pictures. Better pay more for a better product.
1,Flimsy!,Bought brand new from Amazon and took it to a four week trip to India... the center post tightener broken with the first two weeks. It wasn't even worth carrying it back to the US to return it to Amazon.
2,Really?,When I first got the box for this tripod. The box was not handled with care. It was all broken up and part of it was mashed in. I thought some one had gotten the tripod and played soccer with it. It was horrible. When I open the tripod everything was stiffed. The legs were hard and sticky to get out. The top part of the tripod (where you put your camera on) was very loose (even when it was tightening). The worst part about this tripod is that the single stick that's suppose to come up from the middle will NOT come up at all. I had a $5 tripod at Wal-mart and it worked perfectly fine. Everything was top notched. But this tripod was horrible and it will not work properly. It also had a weird mercury smell to it. I highly recommend getting a different tripod. I might end up going to Wal-Mart and get myself a different tripod. This was not worth the money.
4,Decent tripod for video camera o small photo camera,"I would recommend this tripod for anyone who has limited amount of money (<$100) and want decent tripod for camera that weights less then 2lb. I also tried it with my Canon 20D - it works, but not very good.Someone reported that this tripod cames without the hook shown on the picture (it allows to make it more stable with additional weights). Mine came with the hook.The weight, quality of plastic and overall usability is also pretty good."
3,is very functional but perhaps not of highest quality,It seems to not be of highest quality. I feel that it is going to break very easiliy. One of hte small screws already came off somewhere
4,An Anthony mega-trilogy rolled into one novel,"Piers Anthony's ""Mute"" is, I feel, one of his best novels. It contains all the elements of his classic series, like the Incarnations of Immortality and Bio of a Space Tyrant, but, you don't have to spend all your money to buy five books. Anthony takes the classic Man vs. Society and puts it into a sci-fi atmosphere like only he knows how. I realize that Anthony is best known for his Fantasy novels (Xanth, really), but his science fiction is excellent. I would rate Anthony in the likes of Heinlein, and perhaps Mute will become Anthony's ""Stranger in a Strange Land&quot"
3,Good but not great,"As usual, the story starts off brilliantly. The Knot character is really great and you can't wait to find out all about CC. Then you get into chicken teleporters and flea eggs... Still worth the read."
3,Not exactly,"If you want these wrist bands to work 100%, you need to add Dramamine to the equation- then you get 100%. I suspect the Dramamine alone would do..."
5,works like a charm,"My three kids (ages 7, 4 & 4) get carsick and these things save them from their misery and me from endless carseat washing."
4,"great data, a little hard to follow",I love the information in this book but it seems as if it could have been organized better. I have about half of the book underlined and every time I go back to re-read it I underline more. It has helped me looking at finding my true love from a much better place. If you are at all inclined towards spirituality and would like to benefit from its help in finding a true mate then this is a great book. There are great references in the biography too.
3,Good book for those trying to understand their dating style,"I received this book as a gift from a friend who had a friend recommend it to him. I find that the last few chapters really hit home for me. It is a great book to develop more of an insight as to where you are in your dating style, and honest questions we should all ask ourselves to avoid pitfalls and be in touch with our inner selves. I recommend this book for anyone interested on a new viewpoint on dating, and how to approach it. I would highly recommend Marianne Williamson's Return to Love by far. The one concept that stood out in If the Buddha Dated is the concept of a third body (union). Namaste."
5,Serendipitous,"I purchased this book on a whim; The cover was artistic and the title/font was catchy. I intended to return the book immediately, NOT intending to read it. Around the same time, I started dating. I decided NOT to ""be"" the way I had been in previous relationships. I started reading this book; each chapter seemed to address issues I'd only mused about but never verbalized to my supportive friends. Some of it was difficult to read mainly because I felt exposed and vulnerable to the topic. This is a fresh 'take' on the subject of relationships b/c of it's spiritual approach."
3,A little dissapointed,"This charger is advertised as a ""rapid charger"" but I honestly haven't observed it being any faster than the charger that came with the camera. The only real advantage is that it's inexpensive and would probably be the way to go if you lose the factory charger. This would probably be the cheaper option."
3,Coffee Scoop,Its difficult to find these scoops in the local stores so I purchased through the web. The scoop does the job but the shipping was disappointing. It was shipped without any protective covering for the plastic handle. apparently the abrasive nature of the envelope scratched the delicate colored portion of the handle leaving it dull.
5,Amazing,"I have very thick, straight hair, and this makes my hair so soft. It also really moisturizes my scalp. I always get compliments on the sheen and softness my hair."
1,Greenwood disappoints,"The plot drags with Holmes doing little but offering to ""give much to know..."" something or other. There is little of his deductive mind on display and to add to this, the setting is consistantly dreary and gray. Holmes catches no one in a lie, deduces nothing from their clothing, hands or dialect, learns little from research late in the game and watches three victims die. Your reward for sticking the book out is a subtle screed as to the hard life women had and why they need abortion on demand. Holmes ends by agreeing with Watson they're glad they're not women!May I recommend Larry Millet for a superior Holmes character that stays true to his/A. Doyle's historic period."
3,"Great Score, But Bad Remaster","I would give 5 stars for excellent music, but have to give only 3 stars for a terrible remaster. It sounds like someone turned the Treble all the way up and turned the Bass down to zero! It has a very thin, metalic sound to it. Also, the reverb is way over done, as the other reviewers have mentioned. It's to the point where things are so blended together that you can't distinguish the individual instruments. My original vinyl record is better sound quality then this (if you overlook the clicks or pops). I would recommend the June 29, 1999 re-recording with Stu and the Royal Orchestra over this one. On the re-recording the horns blast through loud and clear and the bass blows you out of your seat. You can hear every instrument very clearly as if you are sitting right in front of the orchestra. The music is fantastic and I think the Battlestar Galactica theme is one of the best ever written. Also, the Exploration theme and Base Star (Imperious Leader) theme are amazing."
4,Great for time-travel back to the late 1970's,"YUP! Just like I remembered it. Lovely music, FULL ENSEMBLE ORCHESTRA, and brings up mental flashes from the 1978 TV show. Also has informative & personable program notes by composer/conductor Stu Phillips, exec producer Glen A. Larson, actor Richard Hatch, and Mark A. Altman (publisher of Cinefantastique magazine)."
1,Dont buy,This is my 2nd rewinder. The 1st one ate a tape the 2nd one arrived in good shape but could not rewind any tapes after about 50 tapes. The supplier was good on the return. This unit is cheep and will not hopd up to the job. http://www.amazon.com/Digital-Concepts-Cassette-Rewinder-Adapter/dp/B000093UDP/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1348496152&sr=8-1&keywords=mini+dv+rewinder
1,A terrible product,"I purchased one of these and as soon as I started using it I realized that I had to keep my finger on the rewind button till it was done after 2 or 3 tapes stated to chew the tape , a true piece of junk"
2,Not very well made.,I was a bit disappointed in this item. The rewind button will not stay locked when rewinding. You have to hold it in place in order to rewind it. Cheaply made. :(
4,Quite Informative,"I am not the best programmer in the commonwealth but this book has taught some much about java that Deitel could not. The OOP part is quite well explained. Arrays,inheritance,Reading and Writing files are some of the many topics touched on;in this book.Much as i do like it i think it could have said something about webservices and anything in developing wed applications. Hardly anything is said.Will be looking out for it in the next book.The other thing are the exercises. These are quite few though im not complaining. If you go through the worked examples. You will be able to bring your own ideas to life as far as developing applications is involved. Its well explained ,not rushed.If you want to understand the basic fundamentals of Java then this is the book.You dont even need tutor to learn. I know i didn't."
4,"Ivor Horton's Beginning Java 2, JDK 5 Edition","Great beginning book for anyone who wants to learn Java. Teaches the syntax of Java, along with the basics to programming. Book includes program examples with sections explaining how the programs work. Excellent source for beginning, as well as advanced, programmers."
3,"Somewhat depressing tale, good performances","In this story, Daniel Craig plays a man who has run from his past and become a drug and sex indulging actor who's lost his luster... then the film shifts into memories of his youth, following the sudden news that his old friend has passed away. This film features some solid acting as well as some graphic sex scenes that seemed unnecessary and gratuitous in my view. The story is compelling, and I won't give away too much about it. It's not a feel good film, but it is a story about opportunities to face our past, confront our feelings, and begin healing. This film is worth watching if you are in the mood for a serious drama."
3,Flashbacks of a Fool,"I'm going to be honest in reporting that I didn't really like this movie. I was never engaged in the story didn't care for the characters and only for one real part had no real emotion invested in caring about the story. I'll admit that its beautifully shot, and the actors do a great job including Craig, Eve and in a small part Mark Strong but in the end all of it was for not because there was nothing aside from a good soundtrack that I found intersting. Theres dramas I like, then theres movies like this which are real made snoozers despite the quality of work put into it."
3,Not James Bond,"This is not the same actor that I've seen in ""Casino Royale"" or ""Quantum of Solace"".That's both the good news and the bad news.I'm not really very familiar with Daniel Craig's earlier work so I found it difficult to accept him in this role.He didn't seem to fit the story,at least in my mind.That colored my reaction to and enjoyment of this movie.That's why I can't really recommend it even though I'll admit that someone who is more familiar with Craig's earlier work might find this to be a good movie and his performance to be perfectly fine."
4,"A quiet, touching story","Some reviewers pointed out that not much happens in this film, which is true. But it's a quiet, touching story that looks back at what happened in Joe Scott's youth, which partly explains how he became the washed up, junkie Hollywood has-been that we see in the first part of the film. The flashback story is compelling & well-acted by the young actors, especially Harry Eden who plays the younger Joe. The music is great, with the Roxy Music song providing a fitting backdrop for the story of loss - of innocence, youth, & love.Daniel Craig shows that he can be a fine nuanced actor as well as the suave, killing machine he portrays as James Bond. There is a part at the end which made me wonder. When the adult Ruth bursts into tears after reading Joe's note, was it because she had been in love with Joe all along, or because it took her back to her youth?"
3,"Yes, he was an actor before Bond.....","Like has been stated before Daniel Craig is now known for playing the current, and in my opinion the best, James Bond. But before he was Bond, Daniel Craig was a very good actor who had played both leading roles and bit parts over the years. In Flashbacks of a Fool, Craig shows us that yes he can act. A film that I can only assume he made during the break between Bond films to keep himself busy, Flashbacks is not a bad film but an okay film that could have been done better. Possibly if it had better direction or possibly a more fine tuned script. The scenes with Craig are well done, especially the scenes with his maid played by rapper/actress Eve. The problem in this film lies in the flashbacks. They seem poorly written and tend to drag on for far too long. Again I believe that if it had been better written Flashbacks of a Fool could have been a very good film."
3,Movie Great; Blu-Ray options poor,"The movie itself was excellent! However, their were very fiew options on the Blu-Ray disc (no commentary, for example). Moreover, the poor presentation of the options on the main disc menu is something that I expect from a DVD, not Blu-Ray."
3,"Nice bag, but far from the perfect travel bag","This bag is purse-sized; it holds a fair amount of small items, but don't expect it to hold more than one moderately-sized book. It has no zipper on the top, which I think is its greatest shortcoming. The strap is thin and has no padding - it actually looks cheap. The strap isn't removable. It does have some good organizational features for small items, and a fairly secure plastic buckle and two magnets to help keep thieves' hands out of the bag. The ""bottle pocket"" isn't really large enough for that - the side pockets are best for sunglasses and cell phones. For some reason, virtually every website I've seen this on in the past two years has the wrong statement that this has a MESH bottle pocket. It absolutely doesn't have one! Oh, and by the way, this isn't a backpack, even if the listing says it is. It's a modified purse, really, with no way to carry it like a backpack."
3,Be aware...,"The above seller does not mention that there is NO TONER in the machine. Mine arrived and I eagerly set it up only to find out that I now had to go buy toner. Also... it is advertised as new, and it may be, but the enclosed CD with drivers is homemade, and definitely not factory made. Also there was no booklet or manual. I couldn't even tell if the toner was missing because I didn't know where it was supposed to be.I just went on-line and ordered 2 cartridges, so we will see soon if this was a good deal or not. I feel it was certainly misleading."
2,Cheap,It's made with cheap materials and it can't hold big cameras with big lenses. If you have a SLR with cameras up to 70-300mm (5.6/6.3) I would say to buy it. For bigger lenses it`s not the ideal.It`s really high and have some interesting features...
5,Perfect!,"I love this case. It fits in my handbag easily, so I don't have to worry about forgetting my Grandson's goggles and also teaching him how to take care of them."
2,Dud!,"I really thought this book was going to be good, with its title and subject and all. It was just an average book though, no excitement and no point. Kit Carson was told by many people that she was beautiful, but I truly believe that beauty is an opinion."
5,FRESH & DIFFERENT,"AN EXCELLENT ALBUM, COMBINING TRADITIONAL & NEW SOUNDS. THE WRITING IS HEARTFELT & THE MUSICIANSHIP IS CLEAN & CALCULATED. REMINDS ME OF THE EAGLES. SOARING VOCALS & TIGHT PLAYING."
2,I'd try another Poppea,"This is a classic recording, and it's still the one used in college music history courses. Too bad. Harnoncourt's version of ""historically informed"" period practice is the style of the 1960s, and that matters: the performance is stiff and unsubtle. The grand parts are simply loud and forceful, not eloquent. I would never fall in love with this opera based on this recording, the way I did when I heard Rene Jacobs' recording (Harmonia Mundi France #901330), which is much more sensuous and lyrical than Harnoncourt's and makes the love story of this opera sound like one. Or if you want more dramatic pacing, try John Eliot Gardiner."
4,an exceptional book telling how it was...,"an exceptional book telling how it was.... and how it still should be. But it's not..Gina Arnold captures the essence of many bands before they became large, though essentially NIRVANA! MAY THEIR MEMORY LIVE ON FOREVER IN ALL MUSIC LOVERS"
3,"Misleading copy about ""enough for 2 years""","There are 365 days in a year. There are 350 filters in a package.Who do you know that only drinks espresso every other day?So, the copy is either deliberately misleading, or you are buying from someone who is very bad at math.This product is PAPER, so you are paying for packaging, shipping and bad copy."
5,Great filters,I use these with my Hamilton single cup coffee brewer. They make the coffee less bitter word word word word
4,Produces tasty coffee,As I get older I find I need stronger tastes. We bought a Gaggia superautomatic expresso machine a few years ago but it didn't put out tasty coffee. I saw the Aeropress and it wasn't expensive so I tried it. The process is a little fussy but the coffee tastes strong and good. We buy Mocha Java and French Roast beans from Peet's and mix them 50/50. I grind them very fine in a little Krups grinder. I just follow the directions and coffee tastes like it used to.
3,Not Pleased,"These filters are not weaved close enough together to prevent small particles of coffee grounds from entering into the coffee cup. I have to use three filters to filter the fine grounds. Two filters in the lower filter basket and one in the upper filter basket. I tried grinding my coffee corser with unsatisfactory results. I also tried wetting the filters to see if I could get a better seal around the bottom of the filter baskets and still the same results, fine coffee grounds in the bottom of my cup. After I am finished using these, I will try cutting my own filters out of basket type filters purchased at the grocery store."
5,amazing,Great product; very compact. Note: in the directions they can be rinsed and reused; each filter works well for about five times.
5,What's not to like?,"These filters are for the Aerobie Aeropress coffee and espresso maker. They can be washed and reused several times, before needing to be changed. However, it is easier to press the coffee with a new filter each time. They are inexpensive. If you only use 1 a day it will last you nearly a year!"
5,McGuinness Flint---High Again!,"Mcguinness Flint are great.This may be an obscure LP from an obscure band but it is well worth checking out.Smoke a Dube, Grab a brew and get High Again with McGuinness Flint.You will not be disappointed!"
3,Journal Entries & Unapologetic Descriptions,"I have to agree with other reviewers. The story would have had more focus if the author had come to terms with the real reasons as to why he chose to be a hustler, but I don't think the author was or is in that place at all and we must respect that.Basically, I liked the interesting parts and tried hard not to skip over the boring ones.I assume the interludes were actual journal entries written while the story was happening. I feel that journal entries make good foundation for a book, but including them in a work of this size made them feel like padding. I had to resist the temptation to pass them over and found them very tediousOn the other hand, I found the raw descriptions of his encounters compelling. I found it hard to put the book down during these parts.I would recommend this for someone with perseverance and a taste for the graphic."
2,a shallow man in a shallow trade,"Having been in many of the situations that Rick Whitaker has been in, I can honestly say that I'm disappointed. This memoir is so shallow after all that is said and done. The person that told him to make it light, was not doing him a favor. I'm sure he has more talent! The only interesting character in this book is a guy named Francisco, who actually likes the men he sleeps with. Even the ""nasty"" ones. A book about Francisco's hustling experiences would be more compelling in my view. Rick's character is as aimless as his writing. By the end of his story, you feel little for him. And you imagine that he'll be drugging and cruising sometime in the near future. Well, maybe the fact that he's ageing and balding will put the brakes on that notion! This memoir makes him look like a used up complainer with no depth of soul. But his encounters are true to life. I'll give him that. Hey, Rick, if you ever read this, send me an email. We both have father issues!"
2,Demons made me do it,Short and an easy read. The author puts in his own diary submissions. The book didn't have an easy flow.
2,Cheesy CD,"I bought this years ago and put it aside. I took it out the other day hoping it would be more helpful now. It really wasn't. The CD that comes with the book sounds like cheap midi music. It would have been so much better if real instruments were used. Also, the book cites a lot of songs as examples to illustrate various points. It would have been great if the songs (or portions of the songs) were included on the CD so the reader could understand the point being made. I think it is time for an updated edition of this book!"
3,Just ok,"This workout is ok but hard on the knees. If you have problems with your knees or are looking to avoid having problems with your knees, there are many exercises on this dvd that you should skip. I fast-forward through these and just do the ones that won't injure my knees."
5,"Great Workout, Great follow up to 30 Day Shred","I did this immediately following JM's 30 Day Shred. It was tough, just like 30DS. I like that Jillian added a bit more cooldown and gave more clear direction on how often to workout. In 30DS I didn't know when to take rest days. JM is clear in Ripped in 30 saying: do this 5-6 times a week.Level 1 is comparable to Level 1 in 30DS, but no jumping jacks (which i hate!). Level 2 and 3 are very challenging. Level 4 is outright evil! I never want to do that again - lol! If you're looking for a great workout to kick your butt into shape, this is it.I also recommend getting a support system, enlist a buddy to do it with you or check in a message boards online. I was lucky to find one and checking in each day made the experience easier."
2,Did not like this one at all,"I tried this one--as I am a big fan of Jillian's original 30-Day Shred. This DVD did not live up to my expectations. It caused me pain, rather than the ""good"" muscle soreness. I'm in good shape, workout 6-7 times a week, and tried this DVD for exactly 1 month. At the end of the month, I felt awful. I did not feel good. I've since stopped doing this one. It will sit on my shelf and collect dust. If you're looking for a good Jillian workout, stick to her original 30-Day Shred. It's the best!"
2,Ripped in 30,"This video is great how it will take you through workouts in 1 - 4 weeks. Except that I'm on the 1st week and it stops before the end so I miss out. I need to repeat these workouts until I get to week 2. I'm happy with the workouts, but not happy that I missed the last part of week 1. Not sure if this will be the same for the other weeks (I hope not). So, I was disappointed that I couldn't finish week ones work out completely as the CD froze."
4,I love Level 4!,"I've been a Jillian fan for a few years. I have most of her DVDs- No More Trouble Zones, Shred it With Weights, Banish Fat Boost Metabolism, 6 week 6 pack, Yoga Meltdown, 30 Day Shred- so I definitely had some expectations for what she said was her toughest workout yet. Honestly, I hate to say it, but I was disappointed with levels 1-3. They felt a little spastic and I just didn't enjoy them or feel like the workouts were up to par. That being said, I wanted to give the whole DVD a chance and skipped ahead to level 4. This was what I have come to expect from a Jillian workout. It was tough, but really well choreographed and I definitely felt it. For the first time in a while she got me grunting and groaning on a move or two. I might borrow a few of the moves from the first three levels when I workout without a DVD, but as far as Ripped in 30 goes, level 4 will be the only level I use. I'd love to see her come out with an hour long workout that was at this intensity!"
5,Excellent DVD,"I absolutely love this DVD. If you are a beginner def start with week one and continue doing week one until you can do week two. Its not easy. I usually do level 2 or 3 (trying to get to 4) and then I combine this with six pack abs. You honestly do not need the gym with Julian Michaels DVD's. She is not the easiest trainer. I am in decent shape, but due to previous back surgery and medications I gained tons of weight. Sometimes with my schedule its hard to get to the gym so I tried her DVDs and they work! I have been slowly getting back to doing hard core aerobics and have even managed to have less back pain bc my core is firmer and my knees and legs ache less due to my weight loss. I highly recommend this to those that do not make excuses and are willing to put the work. U do not need a gym or lots of money to be in shape. Try this DVD. its great and quick. Others that are good are 6 week six pack abs, no more trouble zones, and Banish Fat Boost Metabolism! GOOD LUCK"
2,Korny,"The exercise DVD may have been very good but, I couldn't get past Jillian and her Korny remarks..less talking and more exercising..I wanted very much to like but, I ended sending back."
5,Ripped for sure!,"I have tried two workouts on this video and they will definitely get you in shape. What I love about Jillian, is that she is a motivator. She knows her stuff and will get in your face, even on a video. But it works! One of my favorite exercise videos."
5,This work out kicks my booty!,"I just finished week one and I'm on week two! It's really quick especially if you don't have that much time to work out, But Jillian delivers! I'm satisfied with this product :)"
4,Ripped in 30,"I don't have any complaints with the workouts. They are tough which is what I wanted. The problem is each time the DVD is started I have to go back and say ""no"" to the sub-titles. It's a waste of time when you only have a limited amount of time to get your workout done. The DVD should be set up in a way that you do not get the sub-titles UNLESS you choose to have them."
3,Hope your in shape,"I have been working out about 4 days a week to slim in 6 and p90x videos. I did the week 3 thinking I was more advanced than week one but after 20 min with Jillian I was drenched with sweat and had to take several breaks. I also felt that this workout was so fast paced there is a high risk for injury with some of the moves esp when you are so tired, form tends to suffer"
2,Very annoying,"Although jillian's exercises are always good and challenging, she is really full of herself in this DVD. She constantly talks about what a tough trainer she is, rather than just encouraging everyone to work hard. And I really get sick of her flirtatious behavior with the people doing the workout. I'll give this one away and stick with the 30 day shred."
5,Ripped in 30 Review,"Awesome.... I used to be a ""gym rat"" and would NEVER consider doing anything like this at the house - I decided to try it out, and I love the DVD, and of course, the convenience of doing it in my own living room! Jillian as a trainer is fantastic - She takes her time to explain the moves, as well as why we are doing them. It also helps that all you need is a mat and a pair of hand weights, and that doesnt take up too much room in my living room.. IIn the first couple weeks of doing the video, I could tell in the back of my pants/jeans that i had more room. My thighs and butt were always the hardest to slim down - but w/ this video, and the 3-4 days a week that I follow it, that has become a reality! I look forward to working out w/ her again soon, and all that she has to offer!"
3,Pretty good,Okay so I have never seen Jillian before on any shows or DVDs I found her to be less then disariable but if you get past her personality the actual exercises are very effective. Personally I enjoy Jackie Warner better unless you are a Jillian fan.
4,Amazing workout for 20 mins,"Highly impressed with what a good, complete workout this is in 20 minutes. A bit hard on the knees though even though I pay attention to proper form. Have recommended it to others."
5,My husband & I give it 5 starts for transforming my body!!,"My husband said he'd definitely rate this DVD five stars because it helped me totally transform my body! I've owned Ripped in 30 for about 3-4 months and cannot say enough good things about it. It's an amazing workout that doesn't take a lot of time. Honestly, with the help of this workout and Jillian's 30 day Shred, I lost 35 pounds and have toned, defined muscles without looking like a body builder (I'm 44 and in better shape now than when I was a teenager). And, since I've seen such amazing results, I have had no trouble keeping up the routine because I know it works. It's also perfect for all levels of athletic ability."
1,waste of money,"I put this down on an outside deck step (only traffic is myself and a dog). It is coming ""unstuck"" in less than a week - didn't even make it to the first frost!"
4,"These work, but are a bit pricey","I bought this to put on our unfinished (but painted) basement steps and they work great. I was worried because our basement steps can be very slippery, especially if you're in socks. I've installed a strip of this on the edge of each step. It really works well and looks nice too (blends in with the grey paint on our steps). However, it can get a little expensive to do a whole flight of stairs. I suppose it's worth it if it prevents one of us from falling and getting hurt. Good safety product!"
5,Excellent mini keyboard with full sized keys,"I found this buried in a storage room at work and it promptly replaced the standard issue junk keyboard from Dell. Yes, I had to use a five pin din IBM AT -> PS/2 and a ps/2 -> usb adapters to hook it up, but it's well worth the ungainly ancient connectors. The keyboard is mini, but the keys are full size. Typing feels crisp and has a soft satisfying rhythm. This is a real keyboard, not chiclet or smooshy membrane style. Number crunchers will want to buy a number keypad to go with it.It is worth noting the non-standard arrow key placement and its effect on the right Shift. I quickly adapted to this. Of more concern is the Left Control which is not at the left edge, but one key over where the Windows key would be if it had one. Probably it is easy to adapt to this as well, but I prefer to improve the ergonomics by swapping Caps Lock with the Left Control. Linux users will use xmodmap, Windows users can hack the registry or use SharpKeys (from RandyRants)."
2,Somehow lacking...,"I'm not sure what others saw in this book. My writer friend and I both found it very unhelpful. Van Belkom seems to have a rather staunch and simplistic view of everything he discussed in this book. For example, he considers the use of the first-person point-of-view pretentious sounding, as if to say ""look at me, I'm literary."" What a baffling (and not to mention entirely unuseful) opinion.What also bothered me was that despite the large dimensions of the book, the margins are huge, and there just isn't as much material as I'd hoped for--especially not in the area of the craft itself (as opposed to the marketing aspects).I see that this book was appreciated by many other readers, so I'm not going to advise against buying it altogether. Just beware that if you're looking for in-depth analysis about the actual craft of horror writing, this may not satisfy."
2,Great game with good graphics but brainless!!!!,"This game is only mediocore. The game has good graphics, but bad sound effects. It takes no advantages over the GeForce 3 and Radeon 8500 GPU's and it doesn't even use EAX sound mode! The game has brainless gameplay, which makes the game very repetetive after a few weeks. The only thing i found that the game has as a strong point is that I have never had as many enemies run at me at the same time."
2,"Pretty pictures, dry cupcakes","The photos in this cookbook are lovely, and the recipes are inventive. However, the cupcakes from the three recipes I have tried so far have turned out dry and crumbly. I don't think the cupcakes were overbaked -- it seems like there was something fundamentally wrong with the recipes. I would recommend this cookbook only to bakers with enough experience and knowledge to make the cupcakes moist."
2,"Looks nice, but taste leaves a lot to be desired","The cupcakes in this book seem to be geared for presentation, but they don't taste good. I would look at this book if you need ideas on decorating cupcakes, but would get the actual recipes elsewhere."
2,Okay,Doesn't really curl lashes much. Used after eyelash curler and seemed to make curl lash a bit longer. Wouldn't not purchase again.
3,More trouble than it's worth...,"I purchased this product because I wanted to be able to curl lashes that don't naturally curl in the ""right"" direction. It is so-so at that and the fact that you have to remove the battery between each use (or it goes dead in 2 days even when it's turned ""off"") is a real negative."
2,Not impressed,"I honestly did not notice any improved curling with this product, in fact, I think that the heat melts my mascara and the comb makes my lashes look thinner and sparser (I had heard that it worked better AFTER putting on mascara). No better when done before mascara either. Metal eyelash curlers are the better way to go."
3,"Eh, it's okay","I had read a few good reviews of this eyelash curler and it had been recommended by a gal on a beauty discussion board I belong to, so I purchased it. My experience is that it is OK. It takes a long time to actually curl the lashes once you figure out how to. Perhaps because I have staight-as-a-board eyelashes, but the curl doesn't seem to last. It sits rarely used in my beauty drawer."
2,Not what I thought it would Do,"I was losing eye lashes because of the eye lash curler so I thought this would do the same thing, Curl my eye lashes. Bascially it did nothing for me. I used it for about 15 minutes and tried to curl my lashes. Really did not work like your basic curler. I will keep it only because it is a pain to return."
5,Awesome curler! My wife loves it!,My wife has tried them all... Most recently a curler from Sephora. I went through two dozen of them and found the best and after a few days it fell apart. We went back to them and it happened over and over. The Panasonic has a great battery life. Good product.
3,Takes Practice,This heated eyelash curler was recommended by a friend. I've tried it a couple of times and still need to practice. One of the suggestions that I read that has worked for me is to apply some mascara FIRST and then use the curler.
4,Overall great product,The product works great. My eyelashes maintain a perfect curl all day long. The only negativity would be that it requires a fairly new to new battery at all times or it won't heat. That can be annoying when you think it's been heating for the last 5 minutes.
1,BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY,"I ordered this hoping that it would be my new best friend. Boy, was I wrong. It did absolutely NOTHING to my lashes. I have long, straight lashes and it's difficult to keep curls all day with the weighing down of mascara. I tried this curler before and after mascara. Did nothing before, and it didn't separate all my lashes naturally after. In fact, it clumped groups of eyelashes together. Don't waste your money buying this useless thing."
4,Great for fanning out clumped lashes,"The curler works great to fan out my lashes AFTER I've curled them with a regular curler and applied mascara. Doesn't work so well curling my lashes as is. However, all of the tutorials I've seen online instruct you to use a heated curler after regular curling and mascara, so I don't think this curler was invented to substitute normal metal curlers anyways. No problems with the product breaking on me."
3,not appropriate for young children,"I was actually surprised to see this toy listed under a 10-year old age group. I wouldn't call this a ""toy"". You can't play with it. It is definitly an adult toy due to the nature of his ""performance"" I purchased Humphrey for my college-aged daughter after an uncle had purchased it for my terminally-ill nephew. He got a lot of laughs out of this little strap on dog as did the other students at my daughters college. If you are looking to get a gift that will bring laughs to a party, this is the gift. But, do not buy Humphrey the humping dog for your 10 year old."
1,Terrible product,"It worked one time. Also, no papers were sent with this purchase to make a return ....so in the trash he went."
1,Read at your own peril.,"About as interesting as drying paint; flows with the rapidity of Molasses in January; has an understanding of humans and their emotions like that of a five year old.T.M. Wright has a big mouth (he's been talking about this book and its movie adaptation for years) but very little to back it up with this lame, boring, empty novel that has nowhere to go and takes its time getting there."
5,An outstanding reflection on the meaning of Jewish history,The effort to understand central events in the history of Israel and put them in philosophical and religious perspective is the heart of this very deep and thought- provoking work. It will not provide pat and simple answers but does enrich the reader and give a real sense of the wonder and meaning of Jewish history.
1,bridge and cribbage very defective,"The bridge game doesn't adhere to basic bridge rules. The experts play as novices. A partner makes errors in plays, losing the contract. I like that you can delete the player's faces on this one game.Cribbage rotation of deal gets stuck. I dealt 7 times in succession. Frustrating. It does count fast. You can backup and change the crib cards if the 'up' card is not to your advantage. That was is fun way to cheat"
4,Great Personal Face Groomer,"I am a licensed esthetician and because some clients use retinols or other Vitamin A derived products, it is not recommended that they wax their faces. This handy little product addresses excessive facial hair nicely. I purchased this product as a gift and she is thrilled with its performance."
5,A fantastic razor,"This is the BEST razor I have used. From reading the other people reviews who already own this product, it does what it says. It will give you a close shave and will trim your facial hair down to the root. Now my upper lip has no hair whatsoever"
4,good product,I owned an older model Panasonic facial groomer which I enjoyed for many years. When I replaced it with this newer model I was pleasantly surprised. The new curved design works well and I couldn't be happier with this product. Really does the job!
3,"Its not the best, but its good.","This is a pretty good product, but it only really works well for peach fuzz on your face. So do not buy this if you want to get rid of anything more than peach fuzz, but besides that, its ok."
4,"Great on face, not anywhere else.",This works at its best on fine hair such as peach fuzz but with coarser hair it can pinch. I tried using it on my bikini area and it didn't cut it.
4,Gets caught often but otherwise good,"This product removes hair pretty quickly and painlessly. However, as other reviewers have mentioned, it gets stuck often and temporarily stops if you are trying to trim an area with a lot of hair (nape of your neck, bikini line, etc.). If you hold down the pivoting head with your finger, it doesn't get stuck as much. Because of that reason, the pivoting head hurts, rather than helps, this product. But overall, it's cheap, and it works, even though it does get stuck sometimes (and it doesn't hurt when it gets stuck). I'd say it's worth it if you need a little hair trimmer."
5,Fabulous product,"After much research on how to remove my newly-discovered facial peachfuzz (I am postmenopausal 63), I ordered one of these. What a fabulous product. Worked like a breeze! Now my husband can't call me Fuzzy anymore! I'd recommend it highly."
3,Good product,"It is OK. A little uncomfortable to handle and use soft touch on my face, but will do what I need it to do."
5,Great Trimmer!,"I was pretty skeptical at first..Not sure if it was going to work, I have bought many from stores that have broke and hasn't done the job! But I highly recommend this cuts the peach fuzz hair also the mustache! works so good and leaves your face smooth no need to wax again. I'm so happy I went through with this purchase."
5,LOVE THIS,This trimmer is very smooth on the skin and does a great job. I am very pleased and would recommed this to anyone.Great product!
2,Nothing spectacular,"It did not come with any carrying case, in spite of the claim that it does. So now I have all the little pieces (combs, extra blade, cleaning brush) to find a home for. I don't see that it does any better a job than a regular razor, and the brow combs are a waste of time. TO be honest, I would never order one again."
3,This is Adequate,"I was desperate to find a new product like the old Panasonic Cosmetic Groomer (ES 119) but I found out it was discontinued. This new groomer with pivoting head doesn't come close to the old groomer, but it's the closest thing I could find, so it is better than nothing. This new groomer is too weak powered, and you have to go over and over the same spot too many times. Plus, all the extra parts are totally overkill. Panasonic, please just give us back the original cosmetic groomer--it was so much better!"
3,Facial Groomer,This Panasonic facial groomer works fairly well. It doesn't merit being more expensive than any other facial groomers. It works about the same. They should have at least included one battery just to get you started with it. The next time I need to purchase a facial groomer I will purchase one of the cheaper models which are not necessarily made by Panasonic. I felt like I just paid for the name.
3,Not that great,"Not as good as I expected. Doesn't get chin hair, even going over it several times, Works ok on lip and face hair."
5,I love Cerys voice.,"I search for catatonia's music and I buy almost five cd,s from this band, really i love the music from catatonia and Cerys voice is so sweet really i'm in love by these songs, and the costumer was the best thank,s."
1,Dissapointed,Difficult to configure for a PC and Mac. It worked for about a month then died. I sent it in and when it returned I set it up and it worked for about 2 days then died again. Haven't decided if I should dig a hole and bury it or send it in again.
2,Review of 704 model Dlink cable/Dsl Router,"I just wanted to say I opened it up, set it up according to the instructions and spent 5 hours trying to get it all setup.TO no avail still can't get it working!!"
1,Netgear RP-114 better than DI-704,"I bought the D-Link DI-704 for my home network, to share my DSL connection to four computers running Linux, Mac OS-X and Windows 2000 and XP. The DI-704 seemed to have all the features needed (NAT for my server, web-based configuration) for the task.Unfortunately, it wouldn't run for more than about 6 hours before freezing the network. Sometimes the subnet (inside the firewall) would remain working, sometimes not. I upgraded the firmware, tried several different configurations, reset the thing repeatedly, and always had the same problem: when network traffic got heavy (say, when my web server got several requests or when several of us were using the network), the thing would freeze, requiring a hardware reset.I ended up buying ther NetGear equivalent product (the RP-114), plugged it in, configured it and haven't had a single problem with it. It's worth the extra cash."
1,Go with Linksys!,"I was unable to install this by manufacturer's instructions. Instructions are, in places, unclear, ambiguous, misleading, incomplete, and inconsistant with the D-Link website. I then changed to Linsys BEFSR11. The installation was done in 30 minutes. This is the first time I ever set up a router, and based on my experience, I would suggest Linksys over D-Link."
5,Essential Kenny G,The title of the CD speaks for itself....KG is truly one of the best and all the music on the CD is wonderful. A must have!!!
5,Plenty of light and good magnification for small work!,I am quite pleased with the capabilities of this particular desk lamp. It uses LEDs and has more than enough output of light for any bench work. The magnifier is covered and can be used to show fine detail work. A terrific addition to any workbench.
2,Toastmaster Hot Plate,"I like the look and feel of this product, but my main concern is that with all of the heat settings, it seems that it only stays turned on with the high or medium heat. When turned onto low heat, the burner turns off in a matter of a minute or two. Also, I don't see a difference between medium and high settings; it all seems to be high heat."
3,"Uh oh, the bad Harnoncourt","No one is harder to label than Harnoncourt, who can be more perverse than any other ocnductor or as brilliant as the greats. Here we get his stabbing approach to Mozart style, with lots of dynamic and tempo extremes. This is a very unsmiling Don Guivanni with no relaxation or charm. Hampson is miscast. He is too much the American abroad, lacking in Italian swagger and Mozartean elegance both. I admire him greatly, but the Don is a lecher and Hampson is more a preacher."
5,good Country,"We listen to a lot of country and Gary is one of our favorites. We first heard ""Nothing on but the Radio"" in the car and it became one of ""Our Songs"". We have since received the album and enjoy all of the songs, with our favorites being Songs About Rain, Don't Look Away, and I Can Love You. Being an avid Willie Nelson fan, I personally enjoy A Showman's Life."
5,Loving Gary Allan! ::smile:: Great Vocals,"Hits home with the music, vocals, the very tone and angst. I love all that this handsome man does in his music."
5,this CD is the cuddly side of revoloution,"This was the first Chumbawamba release I ever bought, and it was a lovely one to start with! I reccommend this CD to punk rockers for quiet evenings; re-read the Haymarket Tradgedy and put track 1-Give the Anarchist a Cigarette-on repeat. This CD is so valuable because most punk, and political music in general, is focused on one aspect of activism: the exultation of the fight. ""Anarchy"" records the quieter moments: the ache of being too late, the euphoria of finding yourself in a movement, compassion and humor and triviality that are less dramatic but more true. The last track, ""rage"", is a beautiful snip of Thomas' poem (Do not go Gentle) transformed into a tiny cry for AIDS victems. It has its moments of ruthlessness too, though!-I have dedicated #11 ""Mouthful of Shit"" to ALL of my ex-boyfriends. Oh, buy it!"
5,Chumbawumba in their pre sellout days.,"Awesome CD that has allot of good political statements and was released back when chumbawumba used to give a @$%^ about other things besides their pockets,the song about homophobia is awesome, and mouthfull of &*&% is dedicated to people like Neol Gallahen of Oasis who preach anti authirtatianism but hob-knob with the parliament, funny chumbawumba has joined his ranks, On a side note Lou is the ex singer of D.I.R.T., you should definatly pick up this (and the english rebel songs CD) but i would advise at a local record shop and on vinyl before you get a cd from here. Peace//Love//Anarchy//Equality"
1,Scroll wheel sucks! Needs seperate number and navigation,I agree with the previous review. To make the review short.The scroll wheel sucks.There need to be some more buttons especially for navigation and one for INFO.There are some good things that makes one point of the previous review null. Overall this is still not worth buying.I ordered a blue remote. It is more purple than blue though.
1,Andy Warhol's Bad (dvd),"The description for this dvd says NTSC and All Regions but it didn't work in my dvd player. This is the first time I've had a problem with an NTSC dvd not playing, so I was pretty disappointed. The seller told me I can contact amazon for a refund."
4,good,"I've read several online articles about building Ferrocement tanks recently, and watched several videos, and every article I read or video I watch all have differing opinions on what the proper mix is, what type of steel support and wire mesh structure should be constructed and how it should be designed.This book (pamphlet?) is, yet again, one persons way to do it.The author did take the time to create check list and materials list templates that could be used by the builder.There were a couple pieces of info that I had not learned elsewhere, such as the topic about what type of sand to use and why. This is probably common knowledge for folks with a masonry background.Overall it was good, but he calls it a treatise, and that might be generous."
5,Groove the Tibetan Groove,"Tibetan Groove (2007) is an exceptional album by Karl Maddison. If you are looking for an instrumental recording of exotic imaginative trance quality, this is it. The album consists of a mixture of traditional and authentic Tibetan instruments together with pulsating percussion throughout. Karl Maddison show his musicianship throughout this conceptual disc: he composed, performed, recorded, and mixed the entire undertaking himself. You can easily kick back, mellow out, and chill listening to this pulsating album; you can also just as easily use the songs for contemplation and meditation."
5,Worth every cent,"This is the only round scrubber ball I've found that doesn't fall apart. They'll never let you down, do a great job at removing cooked foods off pots & pans without wrecking the cooking surface."
3,"Murky tips, lots of repetition","While I can see how it might be fun to read all the little stories in it, the book can mostly be summed up with ""learn how to keep your rhythm.""I agree with one of the other reviewers, a good rider should easily be able to do all the exercises in the book. For the price, a rider just beginning jumping would find a lot of really useful tips in this book."
1,"Good idea, bad quality","My wife an I were happy to find these for both safety and aesthetic reasons. We bought two and were so pleased with them we bought two more. But after about a month of using them, two of the four stopped working, so now there is just a bulky box hanging on the end of our blind cords, making them possibly more dangerous then when I started. I would not recommend this product for anyone."
2,Hmm does it really work?,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. It was expensive and fancy looking, but does it work? I think the results are inconclusive, certainly not clear one way or another. That being said the majority of the wines my wife drinks are sub $10 bottles, so it may be that the wine is questionable to begin with. I have used it on some quality wines and I would still be hard pressed to determine if the argon made any difference. I would not make this purchase again unless the price was cut in half."
2,American blues,"Maytag blue, Oprah Winfrey's alleged favourite, is in my opinion to creamy. When the price of Maytag blue, roughly $14.99/lbs is more than the higher quality English Stilton by $2.00 at my local market, Stilton is a better option. If you have the money to waste though, I reccomend blending it with 1/2 tsp at least of Lemon juice in an electric mixer on the lowest setting to get a more satisfying experience out of the cheese."
1,Junk,This book is a waste of paper and my money! You can get more info from the online help in Visual Studio or Web Matrix for free.
3,Doesn't work with some bottles.,It's good to have but I use the Avent bottles which do not fit all that well on the drying station.
2,Too many pieces to put together,This bottle drying rack has too many pieces to put together making it difficult to stay in place. I am still trying to figure out how to make it stay put together. It would be alot better if it all was molded in one piece so it would not come apart so easily! Very frustrating!!!
1,Not useful for me,"Only holds a few bottles at a time. Gets the counter soaking wet because it leaks. Definently didn't work for me, sent it back the next day."
1,Never got it to work!,"Fresh out of the box the software provided would not load properly, it would freeze my entire system. Downloading the latest drivers and latest software from ATI resulted in basically the same. The support from ATI was horrible and simply redirected the 'blame' on me and my system. Interesting though, I seem to have a very powerful system that tackles very memory hungry graphics without a hitch....I've never had a problem with new hardware or the associated software until ATI. Save yourself the time, the hassle and most importantly the money - look elsewhere."
1,Don't buy,"I tried this device with 3 of my computers. It only worked with my laptop. One of the desktops the software won't install and the other, which is brand new, the application won't open after install. There are some major problems with hardware compatibility and the multimedia center software. ATI support is of no help. I am returning mine. Look for a different TV Tuner."
1,Get what you pay for,"It was cheap and it perfroms....cheap.The worst thing about it is CHOPPY video. It never plays smooth, always start and stop video.This is being used with a newer laptop 2 gig Ram and dual core intel pentium.It doesn't matter what other features it has or how good the quality of the antenna or remote is, if the video doesn't work the thing is useless."
1,This Book is A SICK JOKE,"This book is so silly, filled with error after error, anyone who believes this probably should seek professional help. What a waste. Deserves ZERO Stars"
5,"Word of God or word of man, you chose","Do these verses agree?Psa 12:6-7 KJV) The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. {7} Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.(Psa 12:6-7 NIV) And the words of the Lord are flawless, like silver refined in a furnace of clay, purified seven times. {7} O Lord, you will keep us safe and protect us from such people foreverNuff said..."
1,The KJV is superior BUT this is Horrible Scholarship!!!,"I believe the modern versions are based upon corrupted texts and that the KJV is the best translation in the English language, however, Riplinger&#65533;s &#65533;New Age Bible Versions&#65533; is garbage! Her scholarship is found wanting at every turn and the spirit of her apologetic is not fitting the name of Christ. Riplinger has done more harm to the Traditional Text than all of the textual scholars of the last 200 years combined.If you are wanting to read something defending the text behind the KJV and showing its superiority to the modern versions, read anything by Dean Burgon. Also, &#65533;The Identity of the New Testament Text&#65533; by Wilbur N. Pickering and the section on Textual Criticism in the &#65533;Dictionary of Theological Terms&#65533; by Dr. Alan Cairns are exemplary."
1,for the uneducated adn uninformed,"This book is full of misinformation, numerology, etc, and is based on the notion that biblical manuscripts from the 1000s AD are more reliable than those from 200-400 AD, though common sense and scholarship argue otherwise. Gail's degree is in interior design and she should stay in that field instead of pursuing her Biblical endeavors."
3,Book: MILDEW,The MILDEW book was ok. I read most of it but I truly thought it'd be about things MIL's shouldn't do but these MIL's were horrid! I will truly try to be a good MIL but I probably will end up a MILDEW..lol.
2,Not My Favourite Glass soundtrack by any measure,"Koyaanisqatsi - Life Out Of Balance is not quite dreadful, but his use of voice is mostly effective in the atmospheric opening and closing segments with, at times, the bop-bop noises just thoroughly irritating during the rest of the album.And, annoyingly, this is a physically thick CD. It would not play in my laptop slot as every other disc I've ever owned does. So no adding that first & last track to iTunes - frustrating.I am a pretty solid Glass fan, but this was not for me. Too bad & glad I didn't waste a whole bunch of money on it."
4,Great except for one thing,"This microwave is nearly perfect. It is a good medium-large size, looks nice and does not show excessive fingerprints. The controls are easy and useful and it performs well.The only thing that really annoys the heck out of me is that the clock/time display is very difficult to read, particularly from an angle or a distance. There is no contrast. You really have to be looking straight on, up close, to read it. My previous microwave had a display that was very easy to read, so I don't understand why this one is so difficult. It is going to bug me for the lifetime of this microwave, because it's too much of a pain to return it to Amazon."
3,Sonic Adventure 2: Worthy Buying?,"I bought Sonic Adventure 2 the day it was released. It is a fast paced adventure game with many characters and a good amount of levels. Its fun, it has good graphics and great music. So why not buy it? Well although it was pretty fun and well balanced in most areas it could be beat easily by the majority of gamers in 2 to 3 rentals and after beating it the arcade feeling multi-player certainly isn't enough to want to keep playing it. Rent it, beat it, forget it."
3,Sonic on the GameCube Is Great!,"Sonic on GameCube is a great idea!The Sonic Adeventure Battle 2 for GameCube to some extant is a good game. Sonic Team just could have made it better, and I'm sure Sonic's next game will be much more about Sonic and his friends. Tails just really needs to leave the annoying purple machine and the game has to be more about the man, Sonic."
3,Where did my chao go,The only thing about this game I hate is if your child is playing the game your chao can die. Yes it will disappear and never come back again but if you are lucky it will be reborn.
4,the best game ever,"when i frist got into sonic i said ""sonic in 3d no way"" but this turned out to be my favorite game.graphics 4.5/5: the graphics are great especily the bosses graphics. the only graphic problem isthe motion of the carachters in movie sceans.gameplay 5/5: fast rushing sonic levels, exploring with knuckles, shooting with tails, it's got it all.sound/ music 5/5: get the soundtrack for this game because the music is so fricking good and it has words! the sound is'nt too shabby either.overall 5/5: buy it, rent it just play it! oh yea. once you think you've seen it all in the story modes somthing pops up..."
4,The best game ever,This is the best game i've ever played. the grafics rule you can be all of the carachters. I think this will be the best game nintendo will make
4,SA2 Bttle rUleS,"This game is one of my favorite sonic games!I just found out about sonic 2 years ago and I loved it right away.This game was new to me.But later I found out it has all sorts of secrets to unlock,like hidden costumes for all the characters.There's over 30 stages and 150 missions!There's also a sound test so you can listen to cool sonic songs like live and learn and it dosen't matter.This game is awsome!But I'm not gonna give away anymore.You'll have to buy the game to find out.So if your a sonic fan and looking for something to do, buy this game!"
5,Sonic's request,I think the game is very fun.it has very good graphics.It dosnt have evil things.Its good for all ages.It is a very fun game.You can pick different levels after you beat them.And trust me their not hard untillyou get up to very high stages.But trust me you would deffenetly like this game.
3,"Great Game, But Kinda of Overrated","When I first tried Sonic Adventure 2 Battle, I thought the game was great. But I really hate the Tails and Eggman mission, because you don't really do much and it kinda hard to jump on the platforms,when your on a machine walker. And the Knuckles and Rouges mission where ok, but it was boring.Sonic and Shadows mission, were great. Once you complete the game you can spend your time upgrading and caring for your chao, which makes the game plability last longer. So on a scale of 1-10, I'll give this game a 7.5-8.But overall I recommend you to get this game if you are a Sonic fan, quiet frankly this is probably one of the best Sonic games since the Sonic 3."
2,Bored Stiff!,"I saw all the rave reviews, so I decided to pick this one up. Talk about a dissapointment. 75% of the time you follow a set path which can mostly be traversed by simply holding up on the control stick. If you want to blow stuff up...well...ok, but you don't really need to half the time. The levels which have a greater degree of freedom have no order, so you basically wander around until your crystal indicator starts beeping. I'm bored of the game already. When are the real games going to start comming out for the GameCube?"
2,GOOD GAME BAD CAMERA ANGLES,this game is fun... the camera angles drive you crazy and actualy affects game play beacuse sometimes you cant see where sonic is I really dont like this game anymore and i dont ussually get sick from playing on my gamecube so its not me it serriously is the game dont buy it especially if you are sensetive to games and might get sick
1,This is soooooo unfair,"Let's get one thing straight: I haven't played this game. But I want to! I WANT TO!!! But it's only released on a console that died ages ago (Dreamcast) and this... little thing (GameCube). I'm a PS2 gamer and buying a GC would wreck my pride! But it's so unfair!!! While GC gets all the big games like Sonic Adventure DX, Sonic Adventure 2: Battle and Sonic Mega Collection, us PS2 gamers get only the decent-but-multiplatform Sonic Heroes, the awful Shadow The Hedgehog and a toned down Mega Collection. I can't stand this!!! Why wasn't it released for PS2? Why SEGA? WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY???"
3,To be a Sonic fan...,"That truely is the only way to be a big fan of this game. The game-play, in short is just plain lack'n. The Sonic games for Genisis and Gamegear had more replay value than this. The multiplayer isn't even that good. RENT THIS ONE FIRST BEFORE YOU BUY! If you're a Sonic fan, I'm sure there's something here for you... enjoy."
5,Great Manchego,"This manchego is great. Smooth taste and good consistency, great packaging to ensure it freshness (sealed bag and dry ice). Highly recommended"
5,Wonderful,"This is a wonderful recording, and one that I never tire of listening to, year-round.The tracks listed above on the Amazon site are mistitled, however. Missing is the first track on the CD, the actual ""Sybil's Prophecy,"" and so the title for each track listed is actually the title of the previous track."
3,Back saver,"The reach extender is a good product that works just as advertise. I have suffered back problums for over 10 years and find it difficult and painful to bend over to pick up anything. when prepairing to mow my lawn it's necessary to pick up the many pine cones that fall into the yard from our two pine trees, without the reach extender this task would be impossable for me. I must express my disapointment with the munfactorer of the reach extender, the item is advertised as being equiped with a 'magnetic tip' but when the reach extender is received there is no magnetic tip."
4,Nice but a little disappointed,I love flying from a carrier and landing on one too. I was a little disappointed though to see that the carrier is enveloped in fog all the time. Perhaps this is a system problem of my computer though. I am not running Windows Vista yet and my system is a few years old.
4,"Good light, but wider than most 50w halogen lights","I bought these as replacement bulbs for some spotlights I have. Unfortunately, they are wider around the rim than the old ones and don't fit. But they do put out pretty good light, if you have a fixture that's got enough space for them."
4,King of Nothing,"I really like the last song on this cd (Every beat of a heart)!!! I have watched the video many times, and it really hits close to home. It's amazing that they can write a song, and it just is like they know exactly who you are, and are singing it just for you! Julie"
3,Difficult but....,"This toy takes some practice. My 10 year old hasn't mastered it yet, and my 7 year old is not heavy enough to manage to make the spring contract to get some bounce. Probably better for the 10 and up crowd, especially those who understand it will take practice to get the hang of it."
3,Danger!,"I do not have this toy but I must caution you kids like me, wear a helmet! The manufacturer review says to wear tons of protection if you read more of it, and only get this toy if you must have a bounce as high as the other reviews say!P.S. I AM a girl......"
5,Awesome Pogo stick,"This pogo stick is great! It feels very sturdy and well built. I'm not sure how other pogo sticks are, but this pogo stick is quite loud and noisy. my neighbors get annoyed whenever i use this outside; perhaps because I live in an apartment complex. but other than that little detail, this pogo stick is pretty awesome! i read that the rubber stub at the bottom of the stick come off very easily, but I've never encountered that problem- one good suggestion i read from other reviews was to check the rubber stub before you use the pogo stick. and Always wear a helmet!!!"
4,Pogo Stick,"The pogo stick was a lot of fun for me. However, I was giving it to my 8 year old sister for Christmas. Unfortunately, she isn't heavy enough to use it because the spring is so strong. I would suggest this toy be given to someone at least 100 pounds in weight because of this."
3,It is what I expected!!,This Pogo Stick is just what I expected. It is worth the money that we paid.
4,Good buy!,This was exactly what I wished to purchase for my Grandson to fullfill his birthday request. It was a big hit.
5,great product,"We sprayed it with silicone spray and my 78lb., 10 year old son could immediately bounce repeatedly on this pogo stick. He is a strong, athletic kid, but he could bounce with ease. So far we have had no problems."
3,Bought for 8 yr old,"She tried it but couldn't really do it yet. She needs more weight on her, so it sits in the garage untouched. My husband tried it and liked it but it left black marks on our cement. It does seem well made."
3,Not Good for Stunt Pogoing,"I've been through six Master Pogo Sticks since I first started stunt pogo sticking. Most of the time the handle will bend right off after I'm jumping. Other time the bottom shaft broke off.If you are serious about stunt pogo sticking, I would definitly reccomend the Gravity Games Pogo Stick. I have yet to break it and I have tried the craziest things on it."
2,Rubber tip lasts only days,"Purchased pogo stick for 11-year-old 80-pound boy. He enjoys the toy and is able to bounce quite high. The rubber tip wears out shockingly fast, after only days of use. The company includes an order form for replacement rubber tips, $1.50 each. Stupid design or ingenious revenue producer? Hmm."
1,waste of money,This type of a pogo stick is not for kids 12 and under!It's very stif and hard . my 12 yr. old daughter can't even move it a tiny bit ... You should be at least 120 lb to be able to move the springs !!! Zima.
5,One of the best pogo sticks you can get.,"I was reading through these reviews, and saw that some people say this is a dangerous stick; well I pogo a lot, and I mean a lot, I saw one other stunt pogoer make a review on this stick. So I think being an extreme pogoer and all, I would know a decent amount of information...There are 4 good pogo sticks out there, including the foam master, they are the following:The 2 Y frames- foam master/neon master and Gravity games, and the 2 air powered pogo sticks- Flybar and the vertego( which is not in the market yet, but will be soon).So getting back the foam master. I really don't see how it is too dangerous, maybe you guys should wear a helmet, but even I don't wear a helmet and I do stunts on it- never got a serious injury. It is a great pogo stick for beginners and experts also a VERY resonable price. So there should be nothing stopping you in getting this stick."
4,Pogo Stick,"This item (pogo stick) was sturdy, well made and should last a long time. It made a wonderful gift for my granddaughter."
5,Awesome!,"I love this toy, however, it is very hard to use the first time. It takes time and energy to use it properly. Not a whole lot of people use pogo sticks anymore, but I know do! :)"
4,Nice,"We actually received a broken pogo stick, but it was replaced immediately with pin days and this one is perfect!"
4,Pogo Stick,I bought this pogo stick for my grandson. He was thrilled with it and has had a great deal of fun with it. His father has even given it some tries.It is sturdy and has held up well.
3,I was wishing for a better album,"""STEADY PULL"" is one of my favorite albums of the last 10 years or so. This is not quite in that league, but its still more engaging than her ""circus"" recording."
4,Her best album,It's hard to believe that after so many albums Jonatha Brooke would take a step up in material but this is a level above the others which were good to start with. The title cut is one of the best songs and singing performances of her career.
4,Best if you lived during World War Two,"I enjoyed reading this book because I was the same age as the debs during the war. We didn't have to do any difficult jobs in this country as they did in England. We did some knitting, went to USO clubs, sold war bonds and endured rationing of a few items like butter and gasoline. I was a little too young to work in the shipyards though my father was employed as an engineer doing defense work. It was amazing to read how the English women were forced to do war work, living in poor conditions but still partying at night in clubs thatmight be bombed - and taking it all in their stride. It was a very good history of that time.B.J. Haggland (Napa, California)"
2,"3M Anti-Glare Filter for 16"" to 19"" Monitors","I bought this to use with my 19"" laptop to cut the glare. It helps but only very little. My old IBM Thinkpad had a very nice antiglare screen that I miss very much. This is not nearly as good and the mechanism for attaching is bulky and does not work well for a laptop. Clips on OK with a couple of large bulldog clips. I expected to modify the attaching mechanism as this product is not really designed for a laptop. I am really disappointed with the antiglare properties. I expected this product to really cut the glare rather than just reduce it a little bit."
4,Exactly what was needed.,"Quick easy install, serves the purpose for which it was bought, reduces glare to LCD computer screen from light coming behind user"
4,anti glare screen for computer,"The 3M glare filter met all my expectations. If your order it, first measure your computer screen diagonally. That is the size they are referring to."
2,Not what I was looking for,"I thought these ran very small, ordered them for lounging and sleeping but I thought they were at least 1 size smaller. Very short, they went to goodwill next day. Price was good but not worth returning."
1,I received My Basketball hoop Broken!,"I received item # 72351 a 44-inch Polycarbonate Backboard, Portable Basketball System Broken. Even though the item came in a timely manner and the price was not bad. I had a hard time reading the directions and looking at the child like drawings. Once I got the Basketball hoop fully assembled I proceeded to fill it with water only to find the base had a hole the size of a dollar bill in length. So now rather then send the product back and break the excitement my child had once she saw it. I have to hope that three sand bags and a cinder block can keep her safe rather then the based water design that the manufacture obviously decided was the best and safest design for this product!"
3,"My pre-chooler loves it, but is confused......","My pre-schooler loves the illustrations and scope of the machines. But even he noticed that the equipment and illustrations in the farm section are incorrect --- a round baler doesn't make square bales; square bales are tied in the other direction; a self-propelled chopper is not used to put hay into windrows, nor is it a rake; and the machine used to load the hay -- well, we've never seen one used on a farm. Other section of the book are great. Obviously, the author and editor have never helped at haying time. I have a suggestion --- we're always short a few hands in June, and would be happy to provide some hands-on background."
5,This made the Spice Girls,"Wannabe, the Spice Girls first single stormed the globe making the girls hit number 1 in over 31 countries. This single includes Wannabe' (Radio Edit), Wannabe' (Vocal Slam...awesome song!), and the exclusive B Side track, ""Bumper to Bumper"". This is a must for all Spice Girls fans world wide..."
1,Doesn't dissolve,Used this product 3 times in an attempt to get the tablet to dissolve...Never did. Waste of money and time...
1,Clogged up my dishwasher,"I was using another version of this product from the grocery and LOVED it, but this is NOT the same at all. It has clogged up the mechanism in the detergent compartment and isn't cleaning my dishes. Will not buy again."
2,Finish Dishwashing Tabs,"Product arrived quickly but most of the packets had a crumbled; and thereby messy, content. I also got racked on shipping costs making the expense so much more than had I purchased at my local grocery store. I was a fool to buy online (I was following advice from a bargain-type post). Won't be so dumb in the future."
3,Finish Powerball Tabs Dishwasher Detergent,"Compact, no measuring, dishes are clean, glasses shine. It has taken the scum off the glasses that another product had left on them."
1,Don't Waste your money,I have used Finish for Glass in the dishwasher and loved it. But now I cannot find it so I tried this. It is awful. It does not dissolve in the dishwasher and the glasses come out looking like they did when I loaded the dishwasher. Now I am washing them by hand. They should remove this product from the market!
2,The product has gone downhill,"I've been using this stuff for 11 years. It was originally Electrosol, which was a really fine product. In fact it was the only automatic dishwasher detergent on the market that wouldn't stain aluminum in the washer. Then it turned into Finish and the formula was changed, near as I can tell at least twice. Now it hardly gets my dishes clean even when I use an additional tab for prewash. Next time I'm buying something else."
4,These work very well,"Consumer Reports rated these a best buy, and I can totally see why. They work very well, and even in my less than stellar dish washer the dishes do get clean and don't have water spots."
2,Meh,"It's not really any better, as far as I can tell, than any other dishwasher tablets I've used. Although it, for the most part, gets off food residue, there is ALWAYS left over soap residue over my dishes. I end up having to wipe/rinse off almost everything after it comes out.I know that, for environmental reasons, phosphorous was removed from many dish-washing detergent solutions, which led to less cleaning power (would generally still leave rings and residue). Finish, however, still uses phosphorous in their products, which leads me to believe they would clean your dishes better than the phosphorous-free alternatives. This is not the case.Main point here: I don't recommend these tabs."
5,Clean everytime with little to no prerinsing!,"We had previously been using cascade dishwashing tablets, but after doing some price checking and product reviewing we decided to give these a try. We immediately noticed a difference with how clean our dishes were. We also spend less time washing things off before they go in the dishwasher. And they cost less!"
2,radio friendly,"It is exactly the words radio friendly in amazon's little review that make me flinch. KS have turned into a pop band and they play songs that are nice, but just a little heavier than your average boyband. Too much Kinks, too much other (better) Britpop bands and even Spinal Tap.Over the top, just not very good."
5,A telephone that works.,"My friend's phone broke. I thought I'd buy her a new one as a gift. I bought this one. It works, and I'll tell you how I know that: I talked to her on the phone last night. She told me she'd had a good day at work."
5,"So far, it's a great value","I bought this phone a few weeks ago at Target and I am quite pleased with it. It has nearly all the features I was looking for (exception is a backlit keypad, but I really don't tend to make calls in the dark- the display is illuminated, though) and none of the extras that would cost more and go unused (I already have voicemail, so I did not need a built-in answering system). The price is very reasonable, especially for a 5.8 MHz phone, and the phone itself is simple to use. The sound quality has been very good and I haven't had any problems with range. Based on all the negative reviews I'd read about so many of the cordless phones out there, I thought I'd never find a good phone that was well-priced, but I think I've actually succeeded."
2,Lose reception beyond 10',"The EXI 5160 5.8 GHz has very poor reception beyond 10' from the base. When you are within a few feet of the base the calls are clear. This replaced a ten-year-old Toshiba cordless, that allowed calls up to 50'. I would not recommend buying this cordless. I will repair my old Toshiba and throw this one out."
2,disappointing,"Just like another reviewer said, it dies except mine died in about a year. It worked OK day to day and this ran a small office of about 10 people but about about 2 or 3 times I found it mysteriously dead in the morning as if it suffered a stroke in the middle of the night and only a reset would bring it back. To the unit's credit, it never croaked during business hours but this morning it croaked for the final time and even a 30/30/30 factory restore wouldn't bring it back. I had the unit protected with industrial strength power conditioners so I do not expect that my power blew it out. I also had problems with saving port fowarding rules regardless of what firmware used as other reviewers mentioned. I eventually got them to stick but it was not easy.The feature set is great for the money but it just isn't built to last but I guess that is what you can expect for the price. Probably a good router for home use but I wouldn't recommend this for business."
1,*Shakes head*..,"I find it rather funny that this brand of coffee...all New England coffees in fact, go for $6.99 at the supermarkets....what a rip off here!!"
4,Just what the doctor ordered,My daughter wanted a better stethoscope. I have had my Littmann Master Classic for years and love it. The hard part will be to keep someone else from walking off with it at the hospital.
4,Master Classic II,I admittedly bought this because it looks awesome in all black but the stethescope works perfectly and im thoroughly happy with the purchase.
5,Fabulous!,"I am a nursing student and i have bad hearing in one ear, and i can actually hear heart,lungs,bowel sounds with this scope! The color purple is very dark, still pretty though. i would recommend this to anyone! im just so glad it works as well as it does, and it came packaged VERY nicely with no damages."
2,Anti-climax,"This movie shows great promise, and builds up plenty of potential for a great war of dirty information between the two main characters, but the movie fails to see it through, and feels as though it has stopped in the middle. I still haven't worked out what role, if any, the housewife and her out-of-work husband play in the movie. They seem to have a lot of screen-time, but their story runs independant of the main plot. Great acting from Kingsley and Byrne, but they are both wasted on this movie. They are all that carries this turkey. Like I said, great potential wasted!"
2,cricket lady was great,"The actress who played cricket was awesome, other that the movie was not good at all her performance made the movie watchable"
3,An OK read,"This is the first book that I have read from this author. The first half of the story was actually enjoyable. However, the second half was just agony to read. There were just too many twist and turns that weren't developed well.My main problem was the characters. I couldn't identify with the female character at all. Penelope Parrish goes against what I believe a female character should be: strong, smart, and believable.... I think Penelope feel to easily into Seth's charm."
3,It's a good Stethoscope,"It's a stethoscope, but a good one. It's my second Cardiology by Littmann and I'm not disappointed. Clarity and separation of sounds that other 'scopes would blur together. I bought the 'copper edition' in the hope that it's distnctive enough that when it gets stolen, the theif will be unable to use it without being recognised as such."
2,quality issues,"I've used Littmann Stethoscopes for over 20 years. I purchased the Cardiology III. It's accoustics are good. Functions great for about 4 months, then the thing fell apart on me. I've noticed the quality of the diaphragm seal was different from my previous stethoscopes. I was really saddened over the degredation in quality of this product item."
1,response to 3 m littmann stethoscope,"I don't ""hate"" the product because I cannot make a judgement on it since I have yet to receive the product. I chose the 1 star rating because it was the lowest rating available. I do, however, intensely dislike the amazon service as relates to this product.This is the 2nd survey you have asked me to complete, and still the ordered item has not arrived, despite an e-mail claiming a ship date of 12/23/12. It is now more than a month after I ordered what I thought would be a Christmas gift. Amazon should definitely follow up with this vendor.kcm"
5,excellent stethoscope,"excellent acoustics, looks great/ unique. professional state of the arts equipment for general practitioner, cardiologist, anesthesiologist or any health care provider seeking superior quality"
5,Made my daughter's eyes sparkle,My daughter has found her calling. She works over night in a pet hospital. This not the usual pet hospital. They have an exotic pet department and the local police bring all the animalss they find on the road. My daughter had been using hand me down stethoscopes so this one is the best non-electronic available so now she has her own and nobody else has a pink one.
3,Bad Boys Best By Bad Boys Blue,This is an excellant CD with a nice music for dance. It contains best songs like 'Pretty Young Girl' from 'Hot Girls Bad Boys' and other songs are also very nice.
5,"Beautiful, folksy, authentic","Received this CD as a gift from my daughter. Lovely, authentic voice, poignant lyrics. Music from the true singer/songwriter tradition. Just lovely."
2,Disappointing,"This phone has some nice features and is easy to operate. But this phone's range is poor. We can hear static when using the receiver at the opposite end of our house, and when I carry it outside, I can go no farther than about 150 feet before it loses its signal and cuts off. Like most people, we have had numerous cordless phones over the years, of several major brands. Although this one is easy to understand and operate, it has the shortest range of any of them. We will keep it, as it works ""OK"" indoors, but will be in the market for a better phone."
1,Mine broke too!,After less than a dozen uses it broke. My friend has the same product and she said hers broke too. I would not buy again.
1,Broke in less than 2 months,It was great until one of the hooks broke (just snapped in half) less than two months after I bought them.
5,Right on!,"I love this book!! I've thought about trying free diving for a long time. I used to be a very competitive synchronized swimmer and have done just about every other water sport, including SCUBA. I didn't want to start with expensive lessons to understand the sport. This book is exactly what I was looking for!! It starts with a fascinating history of the sport, goes into pretty good detail of the physiology involved so you understand what your doing, techniques, and training suggestions. This book is the perfect stepping stone to guide me into my new sport!! If you're interested in free diving, get this book!!"
5,Helpful Book,It's so helpful for beginner also semi-advanced freedivers. Thanks for to author. But a live excercise video cd can added the book.
5,A must have for all apnea divers.,"A great book that every freediver new or experienced must have.It will teach you new things or make you reconsider those that you already know.It provides all the information you need to know and also has a lot of exercises, with very good pictures, of how to improve your apnea times and techniques."
3,Abraham Lincoln President of a Divided Country,When Abraham was seven years old he moved to Indiana. They were moving 100 miles away. I am going to tell you his family's name.His dads name is Tom. His moms name is Nancy. His sisters name is sara. thay have two pets thay are horses. When thay got they had no house to live in so Tom and Abraham built there house out of braches and logs. Abraham hated to kill but he loved to work .When Abe was nine his mother dide.But Sara tride to take her place. Abraham loved to read books he borowed books from other people.Abraham was 6 feet tall at the age of 21. Abes first job was working at a store in New Salem Illinois.When Abe was23 he ran for goverment but he lost.In 1834 he ran for goverment and he won. In 1834 he married Mary todd. I would recamend this book to people how love to read about facts.
3,okay for occasional use but not daily,"It is difficult to get a leak free fit with these goggles. If I make them tight enough to be leak proof, I have a headache after a half hour of swimming and the evidence is on my face for several hours after swimming. So, if you swim for less than a half hour, they aren't a bad choice, but for longer periods, I wouldn't recommend these goggles."
4,"Very good, but...","My 10-year-old son has 2 pairs of these goggles, and he really likes them. The choice of nose pieces works really well for him. Two caveats: These goggles leave big raccoon marks around his eyes, more than any other goggles he has worn. Also, the tinted ones (he has blue) are just lightly tinted; don't plan to use them for backstroke outdoors."
3,Nice system but disappointed wth sound quality,"Just got this phone a couple of days ago from Amazon. It's a nice system overall, but there are a few things that I'm not 100% satisfied with.Pros:- Lots of features- Answering machine access from any handset- Price- Speakerphone in handsetCons:- Sound quality (some interference and background humming noise)- Phone too small (earpiece needs to cover ear more to improve sound)- Only 12 minutes of recording time- Some echoing of voice when speaking into handsetThis phone replaced my old 900MHz lucent 9050 cordless. The sound quality on my old phone was unbeatable (sound quality almost identical to corded phone).Would I buy this phone again? Probably not."
5,Spellbinding!,"I had the privilege to attend a spellbinding reading of this work by the author at Golden Braid Bookstore in her hometown of Salt Lake City about a year ago. Everyone there was capativated by her enormous spiritual presence. Her book, a succinct, creatively-written version of her extensive dissertation work, is so visual that the reader feels as though he/she is along for the journey."
2,"Well written, horribly dissapointing ending! :-(","I love romance adventure books, and this had both till my dream guy turned out to be terrible! I was shocked when I finished and wanted to cry. I get really into books. I cannot possibly give this book zero stars since it was very well written. However, the ending was just too dissapointing."
3,informative but boring,"good for anyone deeply interested in the Japanese economy and the relationships among business, politics, and the bureaucracy. However, this is a collection of essays and articles from various authors, both Japanese and non-Japanese, and the writing style can be brutally boring. However, each piece is relatively short so the readings can be done 20-30 minutes at a time. For any imsomniacs studying the Japanese economy, get this book.The piece by Eisuke Sakakibara, vice minister for international affairs at the Finance Ministry, is a great look into the mindset of Japanese bureaucrats. Most of the other articles give good insights into small parts of the bureaucratic control over the Japanese economy, but the writing starts to get a bit repetitive by the time the book ends."
2,Disappointed,"Disappointed to find that not all three bulbs in the package were Soft White"" as advertised; two were and matched the other bulbs in the fixture in which I was replacing three burned out bulbs, the other was a bright white"
4,Good Backyard Net,Decent backyard net but the quality of the straps and netting doesn't handle hard shots very well.My son (13 yrs) noticed immeadiately with hard shots that the velcro straps that are provided to hold the net onto the frame started ripping off. We gave up on the straps and we've reattached the netting by weaving a nylon rope around the frame and through the netting to hold the netting on the frame.Now the netting stays on the frome but he's had a few sections of the netting tear out with strong shots in the corners and along the crossbar. The frame is fine. We'll have to replace the netting in a year or two at this rate.
4,Swinger Review,I attached the swinger to a platform and placed it on top of a plastic milk carton for better heigth and stability. It is a lot of fun for target shooting.
1,Short lasting joy.,"Mustek works fine, unfortunately goes down in a few months and can't be fixed. Waste of money, so far. But the idea is great. Need better quality."
5,My 3 cats go crazy for this,I bought this after many people on a cat site recommended it. My cats love it. They even try to get it out of the box when we put it away. It is very durable compared to the cheaper versions in the stores.
5,Deserves 10 stars instead of 5 stars!!!!!,"My cat loves this toy. He runs, jumps, flips and when he finally gets it in his mouth, he doesn't want to let it go and he growls. Yes you heard me, he growls!!! lol. He gets a lot of exercise with this toy. LOVE IT. Will need to buy the feathers refill soon!!! This toy deserves 10 stars. Get it, you won't be disappointed."
5,My cat went crazy over this!,I have to hide it when I'm done playing with him because he drags it around and somehow gets it twisted around everything. It flutters like a bird's wings and even makes a sound like a bird flying very close. So lifelike your cat will truly act like he's chasing a real bird. Highly recommended!
4,cats LOVE it,"My two cats love this toy and even take turns playing with it. This is one of the few ""cat"" toys they both enjoy. (I've had more luck with home-made toys like paper balls or milk jug rings.) However, I do have a few concerns with it. 1- the metal piece that holds the feathers to the string can be dangerous if your not careful. 2- the splinter problem. The rubber piece that covers the bottom of the pole fell off and got lost on mine. now the end of the pole has sharp edges."
1,concerned,this toy seems great at first but has caused my kitty to have a seizure everytime she plays with it. It went in the trash tonight after casuing the 4th episode since we purchased it. BE CAREFUL!
2,Da Bird,"The product arrived quickly and intact. However, the design of the product is such that it tangled and knotted up within the first week. I wound up buying a different toy at Pet Smart with a better design."
3,"Cats love it, but it's not built to last","The concept for De Bird is great - a ""bird"" on a fishing pole. Our four cats go bonkers when we bring Da Bird out of its hiding place (you should never let cats play with this toy unsupervised, by the way. They could get hurt by accidentally wrapping the wire around themselves).The cats attack Da Bird with abandon--so much so that they've managed to detach the toy from the wire several times now. I've managed to repair it, but once they've broken it for the last time, I don't think we'll replace it.I would suggest that the manufacturer improve the toy by doing the following:1. Replace the thin wire with something thicker--say, a shoestring, which would be safer.2. Make the pole retractable to 1-foot for easy storage3 And finally figure out a different linkage system to hold the toy in place."
2,A little biased,"This book is very liberal, which I expected from a social work book, but tends to sound biased in its presentation of topics."
1,Knot a good manual,"Skimpy, poorly illustrated, a genuinely cavalier and flip tone mark this book as a disappointment. Though it's OK for advanced climbers who desire a cursory review of the range of climbing knots, bends and hitches available, this book is absolutely worthless for beginners. Get Knots & Ropes for Climbers by Duane Raleigh, it's much clearer, better illustrated, more fun to read and learn from."
2,redundant,"Knots for Climbers has a few benefits. The basic knots are depicted in step by step procedures which is helpful for the beginning climber. Though the book is exhaustive it does give a good description of the ""how to"" and ""why"" of each knot that the book covers. Though with buying other books this one seemed very redundant because the basic knots covered in this book are also covered in other books (which contain a slew of other knots that this book doesn't cover)."
5,Good Cable,"VGA is a great way to connect your LCD T.V. or monitor to your computer, and in some cases, the only way. If you want the best image possible, you must buy a good cable, and this is one of the best. It is heavy duty, long enough for just about any job, and gives a clear and crisp image. I personally use it to connect my Media Center PC to a 32' Olevia LCD Monitor, and it looks at least three times better than my old junker cable. I have played HD content, PC games, SD content, and of course PC programs, and they all look very good. You can't really get much better unless you use HDMI or DVI.Hope you enjoy your cable!"
1,Safety Hazards and MISinformation,"I'd really like to give this book NO starts, but I guess that's not an option. I am returning my copy. I can't believe the safety hazards this woman takes with LYE. It is a HIGHLY caustic material. (which Ms. Inlow does state) However, In her instructions she syas to pour your liquids into your lye... DO NOT DO THIS! Other than creating a volcano effect which could boil over and out of the container in which the mixing is taking place, due to Lye being considered a HAZMAT(Hazardous Material) it is actually illegal to do your mixing this way in some states..

Ms. Inlow lists a Castille soap that is barely 1/3 olive oil."
1,Just OK,"I wish I would have read the reviews on this book before I bought it. As a novice soaper, I found this book short on technique. I tried one recipe and threw it out. The texture was good but it didn't smell like 'oatmeal cookies' and looked like dog food. I did like the spiral bound design."
4,New soap maker,I am new to making soap. I found the book easy to understand and follow. I have made three different soaps and am excited to make more.
3,This is NOT a 5-star book,"There's nothing wrong with BACKFLASH, but it's by no means a 5-star book. There's one really good bit toward the end, where Parker has to decide whether to spare or kill a character who has betrayed him, but nothing else in the book rises to the same level of suspense or quality. It's a perfunctory heist plot with long stretches of very average writing. I had to fight to keep reading a few times, and put the book down for 3 months between starting it and finishing it.It's easy to find better Westlake novels. This one is run-of-the-mill at best."
5,Inspirational and Uplifting Reading,"In Marci Alborghetti's new book entitled: Freedom from Fear, the author writes poignant excerpts about deep-seeded anxieties that exist and dominant our daily lives. Marci seamlessly weaves into her story passages inspirational prayers of faith that provide the reader with an anchor of spirituality and strength. This uplifting book is a powerful and reflective read for your soul with healing exercises to diminish your fears."
4,Three things I learned from this book,"I am a Filipino-Canadian, and I'm grateful for this book because it gave me valuable insights into Filipino culture (and myself):- hiya = shame. Much of what Filipinos do and don't do is motivated by the avoidance of hiya.- amor proprio = face. Filipinos try very hard to avoid making other people lose face in the slightest.- utang na loob = debt to another after receiving a gift. Receiving a gift is bittersweet for Filipinos because the giver has some control over you now."
1,Disappointing,"In the introductory comments, the narrator starts off by saying how this video chronicles the battles between the ""civilized"" Greeks and the ""savage"" Persians (Iranians). The same Persians, mind you, that at the time of the battles ruled most of the civilized world under the auspices of the first human rights doctrine in documented history. The program's opening statement speaks volumes about the one-sidedness of the entire video. The producers of this supposedly factual historic program aren't even good enough at their work to be able to effectively PRETEND to be unbiased.Save your money. If you want to watch fabricated half-truths, buy a standard Hollywood produced gladiator movie. At least they are more entertaining."
1,Discriminating and politically motivated,Because of the bad imag of the Iranian government in the western world. They use the time to creat this politically motivated and racist video. I suggest you never buy ths video. full of wrong information and propaganda.
4,"Addressing the ""Plan-Driven X Agile"" software development discussion in an unbiased way","Finally a book that addresses the discussion between plan driven and agile software development methods in an unbiased and fair way. I was already tired of reading about ""agile silver bullets"", when finally I came to read this book. After all, this is written by Dr. Barry Boehm, another category of author than the Agile crew.Don't adopt software development methodologies blindly, read this book first."
1,"I'd give it 0 stars, but that's not an option...","As you can see from the other reviews, this product is not very instructional at all. The only benefit my fiancee and I got from it were a lot of laughs. Then we cried because we paid $15 for it. Then we returned it to the store and asked them not to carry it. There are very, very few circumstances in which a person buying this product would actually benefit from viewing it."
4,"Beautifully drawn, erotic lesbian elf-girls!!!","Overall, I would rate this one a pleasant surprise. Too often, I've found these graphic-erotica books to contain a pretty cover drawing but then inside it's all raunchy XXX-porn. That's not the case with this one! The elf girls are very pretty, and their Katmite slave girls are very attractive as well. There's a lesbian-theme throughout this book which I found to be really hot. On the negative side, it's to-be-continued, with only the first part of an apparently long story told. Will I purchase book two? Most definitely!"
2,eSATA not too compatible with eSATA external drives,"I installed this card in a Sony Viao VGC-RA830G running Vista Ultimate. No problem with seeing the card, but when I plugged the Seagate eSATA 750GB Free Agent Pro, system hangs on bootup if cable is plugged into the drive.worst, I also tried the Western Digital 1 TB iBook with the eSATA interface. The drive won't even power on even if you push the power switch.The siig site doesn't offer much help or info.Incompatibility could be with the drive, Vista, or the Sony Viao model. Whatever the case, I have not found an external drive that will work consistently with my system. Card might actually work great, but the incompatibilities I'm running into discourages me with eSATA. Hopefully future drivers and updates will eventually resolve my problem.When the drives do work, the transfer speed is very noticable compared with USB and Firewire 400.Maybe the eSATA is better supported with Windows XP systems."
2,False start for Wings,"Although this album has a couple of lovely songs (Some people never know, Tomorrow), overall it's quite disappointing. Strange enough, the 1st Wings album, sounds more like a lo-fi effort by Paul & Linda. But then without really great songs that McCartney and Ram did have. Together with 'Give my regards' McCartneys poorest effort ever. And yet, some of it is fascinating."
3,THE FIRST WINGS!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I got this lp in 1976 and did not like it much, But kept playing it. A few songs like wild life started to rub off on me, Now I got the cd and wow theirs a lot of good stuff on here, you'll hear how Wings got started."
4,Enjoyable Listening,"The product was shipped timely and arrived in NEW condition.I enjoy McCartney's music, so I am happy to have been able to still find a copy of Wildlife. Just saw Paul McCartney at the Wachovia in Philly on 8-15-2010, the concert was GREAT and Paul is a musician of great stature. This concert was a gift for those of us who never seen a live performance of Paul McCartney ;-)Thank you.MariLynn"
2,McCartney's Worst Effort,"Other than the strong tracks on the album (SOME PEOPLE NEVER KNOW, TOMORROW, DEAR FRIEND, all a bit overlong) this album has hardly anything to offer. It was recorded over just a few days with a fresh band and it feels that way. Songs like LOVE IS STRANGE and WILD LIFE are half finished and tunes like MUMBO, BIP BOP and I AM YOUR SINGER are just worthless junk.The bonus tracks are nice. Give Ireland Back To The Irish is McCartney's best attempt at having a backbone in his solo career. Mary Had A Little Lamb is a garbage response to the BBC banning ""Irish"". It have no musical value. Little Woman Love is a nice underrated track from that era. Mama's Little Girl is a lovely little acoustic track that remained unreleased until 1989 or 1990 on the Put It There CD single. It very well may be the best track on the disc."
3,"It,s Paul","Pauls career and songs with the Beatles are my favirote, and his solo career has been great. Thsi album is okay and has some good vocals I just don,t think Paul did his best on it. bip bop sounds terrible and makes ringo sound really good sorry ringo your a great drmmer and you havean okay voice. GodBless"
1,Warning...,"Having experienced the UT demo in 1999, I decided to purchase Totally Unreal, knowing very well that it would install and run superbly on my new Dell 1.7 Ghz computer system. It installed well enough, but like most games that have come out before Windows XP, this one, TOO, did not run on my state-of-the-art system.I even wrote Infograme's incompetent tech support (they had absolutely no idea how to help me and provided me with only several suggestions) and looked for patches and files on several different websites, including Unreal Tournament's own website.It's an inexcusable shame that a title this popular doesn't have a patch or update of some type to be compatible with XP, but when you consider that Infogrames produced it, it should come as no suprise. They're infamous for ruining long-running series (e.g., Test Drive) and most of their demos that I download rank right down there with other inept software companies such as EIDOS and PSYGNOSIS for having no value or playability..."
3,Not as hard as I expected.,"Only have done Mission 1 and not as hard as I thought it would be. Will have to buy an exercise band and then it might be harder. I am a lover of Taebo from the old ""Live"" series but just getting back into it."
4,Great little projector! - You need a separate remote - not included!,"I do a lot of travel, training and presenting, and this was recommended to me. I've used it a few times recently, and I LOVE how little it weighs! Of course, they never tell you all the cords you need have weight also. I was VERY disappointed that the remote is quite expensive and is not included with factory reconditioned machines. However, I can change the slides using a wireless mouse with my laptop. It's not quite as elegant but it saves lots of money. Also, the speakers are not good for a decent sized room - I bought some inexpensive, very lightweight ones from Radio Shack. With the new TSA rules, you have to take the projector out of the box at the airport, along with the laptop, etc. This is true of any projector. It makes it all the more important to take a small, light one like this."
1,Warning! Please read before you buy!,"This is not a dig on content. This is just a warning as I bought two of these DVD's and they were not playable on any USA DVD players, or computers I tried them on. I believe these maybe for non US DVD players only! Please don't get caught in the same trap I did. I wish I had a post like this to read before I bought two of these. If anyone knows more of the story, please post it. Thank you."
3,Santo 2700 mah Rechargeables,"Batteries are ok but the don't seem to hold their charge very long. If you need a powerful battery to use for a short time then these will deliver the power, but if you want to use them in a device that is not under constant use; I would recommend the ENELOOP since they have a much lower quiescent discharge rate."
1,Does not hold charge,"I bought two packs of 4's of these Sanyo 2700mAh rechargables and a LaGrosse charger through Amazon. I also bought 4 Duracell 2450 mAh rechargables from a local pharmacy. I used the batteries in my Canon point-and-shoot camera. The Sanyos lose their charge quickly; I would go through several pairs a day on normal camera usage. In contrast, the Duracell's can last a few days on a pair. I'm buying more of Duracells."
2,"do not buy, buy Eneloop instead","used about total 20 of them in about 2 years, trashed about 15 of them. have been using the La Crosse BC700 to charge them. they do not hold the charge well and I doubt any of them could be reaching the claimed 2,700 mAh capacity. Used the BC700 to test them and trashed the ones with only a couple of hundreds mAh capacity left (could not hold it either).bought 50 total of the new Eneloop in recent 6 months and have been completely satisfied with them. They are having less stated capacity but they do hold them well. Hard to believe they are from the same company."
5,Great bright lights!,I had to replace a previous pair that lost to a deer. I love the lamp quick connections that make replacement easy.
3,Point-and-click for the kiddos,"My 4-year-old loved it, though the logic on some of the puzzles was a bit abstract for the two of us.q"
5,Love this book!,"This was my favorite book as a child and I wanted to share it with my six-year-old. The book arrived promptly and in the condition stated.The book is a bit silly, it has beautiful illustrations of so many different kinds of birds made of everyday items like tea cups, a salt shaker, boots, and ice cream cones. My son has enjoyed looking at and exclaiming over all the interesting and whimsical birds in the book. It is not just pictures though, there are little rhyming descriptions of each bird type.I spent so many hours looking at this book as a child and loved it so much, I was a little afraid that the actual book could not live up to my memory of it. I was so happy to be wrong! Although published in 1971, for the most part, this boom is ageless. This would be an especially good book for a child who likes birds, but really any child who enjoys whimsical creatures would enjoy it too."
4,Freed From Keys,"I installed two of these about three years ago. They've been a pleasure to use, no problems, one battery replaced. Will probably buy another for a third door."
3,Stopped working without warning,Mine stopped working without warning. Good thing I was at home and was not trying to enter
1,Short Life,"I initially really enjoyed this lock but then the battery died after about four months. I have tried four different brands of 9V batteries in it and none of them last more than one day. I tried to take it back to Lowes but didn't have the receipt so ""no dice"". I feel totally ""ripped off"" by the lock, which wasn't inexpensive. I'm looking at another brand that doesn't require a battery.Schlage FE595VCAM619ACC Camelot Keypad Accent Lever Door Lock, Satin Nickel"
1,Loved it for the first week - until it rained,"My whole family loved having a keyless entry lock - and it was easy to put in custom codes for various family members. However, after the first rainstorm it stopped working. Dried out after a couple of days and started working again - until the next rainstorm. Disappointed that a lock from such a well respected name brand performs this poorly."
5,Works great!,I bought this during a lightning deal. We have a Schlage front door look so I figured the quality would be good as well. It was easy to install (~ 10 minutes). I like the optional inside lock so that you don't always have to enter the code to get inside the house. Color is pretty true for antique brass.
5,"Great 1st impression, time will tell.","It was a breeze to install & price point unbeatable. Very satisfied with the easy programability & versatility. It looks and feels as if it will hold up to our very rough harsh environmental: coastal, damp, high-wind & salt."
5,Schlage Camelot Keypad Lockset,"Awesome product and does exactly what I wanted it to do. I was tired of always carrying keys for my garage around when working in the yard and the keypad keeps all my stuff secure and accessible to me.I have to add, it was a hard to find but Amazon always has what I need. (even if it is a hard to find)Thanks"
1,ABSOLUTELY AWFUL,"This book is AWFUL! I do NOT recommend it. [...]This book is unequivocally unintelligible. I am not trying to say the writer's ability to convey a story is terrible, what I am trying to say, it is not in any comprehensible form that is able to keep the reader's attention. This book is written (purposely) in irregular English that has been1) translated from the original Japanese by a computer (as a Japanese to English translator, I know when a document has been translated by a machine, and this book clearly has been), and2) written with a mixture of the English language and HMTL markup language.These elements are confusing, making it extremely hard to follow any kind of story that may be hidden in the text.Yes, this may sound like an extremely interesting premise. I thought so too. But I cannot warn readers enough: YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ENJOY THIS BOOK! AT THE VERY MOST YOU WILL STRUGGLE TO EVEN COMPREHEND THE MOST SIMPLEST OF MEANINGS![...]"
5,obviously it's not your average novel...,"My hope is that interested readers will get past the dismissive, first review. Obviously, if you want a more traditional narrative-based novel, then Siratori's work and others like it are not for you. Other like-minded work include Mellik's Satanburger, Thacker's Hard_Code anthology, any of the Black Ice books, Noon's Cobralingus, etc. As a 'reader' you should be unsure whether you're reading meaningful prose or just data, and indeed wondering what the difference is between them. Plus, Siratori's own context adds the layer of Japanese high-tech with the cultural stereotype of broken English. The great thing about books like this is that you're not sure how to even begin reading them. I love that. A book that forces you to decide how to read it."
4,Flaw Rulez,"Through the Eyes was Definetely a LOTTTTTTTTTT Heavier with the Melody and ""2"" Guitars which made it sound a lot different than the new Bangin album ""Endangered Species"", I kno that somebody pushed them to sound like they do now...And Chris's lyrics are a little less complicated to understand: Its y i gave it 4 stars instead of 5...otherwise Flaw was my favourite band before and now New Flaw is better than ever.....BUY THIS ALBUM TO MAKE THEM FAMOUS!!!!!!!!!"
4,Still flawless?,"Is it all about heavyness? It hardly is. The point is different, since these days everybody seems to get softer with every new release. And being softer has nothing to do with being talented or untalented. The point is at times something more than heavy riffs may be missing on a new album. And my case is just that.My favorite song off the debute was One More Time, though I have been as much crazy about Reliance, Amendment, Payback and Scheme. This time, unfortunately, I have found nothing as original as One More Time, nothing as melodic as Best I Am, nothing as memorable as Payback, and definitely nothing that heavy as Reliance or alikes. Thus missing is little more than screaming and guitar crunching. But only for me.Most of the fans will easily enjoy Endangered Species. The songwriting and instruments playing talent is still there, and stuff like Medicate, Worlds Divide, Wait For Me, Decide and You've Changed is really beautiful and worth your bucks and listening."
4,Flaw's 2nd effort,Well if you liked the heavy flaw... your in for a suprise. The Heavy is virtually eliminated from this disc. However what is left isn't as bad as these clowns with no appreciation for softer music say. Flaw is a great band and the softer direction works much better with the voice. I thought their better songs were the softer ones off their first disc anyway. As a person who likes many types of music I think it's great. If you are a Heavy music listener only Avoid this disc like that two teethed trainwreck you picked up at the bar last night. Only buy this if you like softer rock. If your looking for metal I rate this Cd a 1.
4,A Mellower Flaw,"I'm not going to get real deep here - bottom line: another really good album from one of my favorite bands. As has already been said this album is much more laid back than Through These Eyes. Still, just like it was with the last ablum - the more I listen to it the more I like it.If you only like hardcore or you just have to have screaming to think a band is cool then you should probably save your money. But if your looking for a great rock album with actual singing definitely pick this one up!"
5,necklace,transaction was fast---the coin looks very nice--the chain was the right length--easy to order through Amazon.com---i would shop here again--
3,"Great music, but $15 is too much for 26 minutes","I really enjoyed the piano solos on this CD. There is a thoughtful tone and peaceful ambience to the pieces that is perfect for listening, contemplation, or background music, but the music completely avoids any stench of ""new age."" Beautiful piano pieces.My only criticism of Cooper's performance is his (mis)use of pedals. He must keep his foot planted on the pedals too long or something because there is often an echoey hum in the music that sometimes muddles the beauty of sound.Although I really like this CD and can see myself listening to it for a long time to come, I have to knock the rating down because to sell a 26 minute CD at $15 is highway robbery."
4,Scientific American Books: a five book set from 1957,"Review of Scientific American Books: Plant Life, The Planet Earth, New Chemistry, The Universe, Lives in Science (5 book set).REVIEWER: Dr W. P. PalmerEach of the books in the five book set is reviewed under its own individual title. All the books were published in 1957 from articles found in the Scientific American, so together they provide the historian of science with an overview of what interested scientists in the middle of last century. The general editors of all the books were Gerard Piel and Dennis Flanagan with a team of Scientific American colleagues: in general the books lack illustration and are about 200 pages in length.The separate reviews of each of the five books contain the detailed contents including the names of the authors. Many of these authors are extremely well known scientists. These books are available at a low price and provide good value for money.BILL PALMER"
3,The good stuff gets lost in the mix.,"This book does make a good addition to a reference library as there is a lot covered. A plus is plant associations for other pantheons besides Roman and Greek. However I didn't find it logically laid out and there are long paragraphs that would have better served the reader in grid format. I also found too much mythology and old wives tales mixed in with the really helpful bits. There are chapters dedicated to these topics so it could have been better organized. Still, there is enough useful information to make it worthwhile as long as you are willing to spend a little extra time looking for it."
5,Good for beginners,"Being new to Irish fiddle playing, I had to go with a recommendation on what to purchase from my teacher. I am happy with this purchase! The accompanying CD is especially helpful. As he states in the text, some tunes aren't played exactly as written, so hearing a tune being played is helpful. Be warned - not all tunes are on the accompanying CD. I also like that the first couple of tracks are open string tuning, since I haven't purchased a tuner yet."
5,Can't Wait for the Sequel!,"The book is an excellent, well-written story of a young woman's struggle to be accepted in the macho world of firefighting. I enjoyed the vivid descriptions. I especially enjoyed the development of characters & being privy to their innermost thoughts. Bette's challenges as a probie, her interesting past and her rocky romance with Joe make for an exciting read and, I think, would make a great TV series! I can't wait for the sequel!"
5,Big Chew,My Siberian Huskies are enjoying this bone. It's extra large so they also enjoy the noise it makes when dropped on the floor too. Nylabone makes the best bones.
4,Perfect for my dog,"Bouli is a 50 lb. mixed breed with very powerful jaws. He needs something serious to work on when he's in a chewing mood, and so far this bone is perfect. After a month, he only has one end worn down, very gradually and after many, many hours of chewing. He can't seem to break large pieces off as he can with the smaller Nylabones. He carries this one around with him, lies there chewing and ""talking to"" it, and even occasionally falls asleep with it. The only negative points so far ... on my end, not his ... is that it's pretty scratchy when he shoves it against me wanting to play, and heavy when he drops it on my bare foot. It also makes a lot of noise when he drags it around on the tile floors. Still, it's not expensive for the amount of time it lasts, and I'll definitely buy it again."
2,Hard Plastic Toy,"My dog has no interest in this toy. I thought this was rubber like the Kong toys that hold a treat inside. However its just a hard plastic toy that my dog has hardly noticed. It was supposed to be ""chicken flavor"" not sure how they did that. Waste of money."
2,Nylabone Big Chew,"Unfortunately, my big chewing dog who goes through a large rawhide bone per day was absolutely not interested in this bone. I tried putting peanut butter on it -- she licked it off. I ended up sending it back and getting the large, black Kong rubber bone that allows you to put treats in either end. She loves it! Plus, it's soft enough that it doesn't bang on our hardwood floors."
1,"My dog didnt toucht it,","It seems like good quality but it has no natural feel it doesnt smell like beef or feel like a beef bone, my dog showed no interest in it."
2,Make sure your dog likes it before you buy it,"I have a German Shepherd who likes to chew non stop. I thought this would be a good, may be slightly more durable chew toy for him, but unfortunately it didn't work. He showed no interest at all, despite my several attempts of encouragement.I tried taking all the other toys away, stopped giving him rawhide (even the toughest rawhide takes no more than 30 mins for him to go through, by the way, but failed. I think part of the reason is the weight:this bone seems to be a little too heavy and clunky, and he has no interest in carrying it. That, and may be the lack of flavor.It might work great for some dogs, but make sure you try similar and cheaper products before you get this one."
2,ADOBE DELIBERATELY HINDERED THIS SOFTWARE,"This upgrade version of ""Adobe Premiere 6.5"" has got clips and sound editing tools, which professionals may like, but the fact that Adobe chose to make it incompatible with RealPlayer, QuickTime, and TitleDeko has forced me to rate it low.Also, do not assume that because it comes with a nice MPEG encoder, that you can easily use it as an all-in-one programme for editing and recording your DVDs. The reason for this being that its designers has ensured that it does not contain any DVD authoring accessory.Although that its video-effects commands, as well as superimposing menu are really impressive, its overall cons simply outweighed its pros.Know that this software would have been wonderful, had Adobe not deliberately limited both its capabilities and compatibilities."
3,fairly icky,"This is a string quartet that has made itself famous by wearing designer clothes on stage instead of the traditional concert outfits. And that's about all they have going for them. The tempi are generally slow, the color is generally plain and bland and unchanging, the recording quality is fairly dry - in short, there's not much of a reason to buy this CD set, especially when you take into account the price that frequently varies, but is almost always about twice the cost of the Fitzwilliam quartet, certainly one of the finest groups to record the Shostakovich quartets. Also check out the Borodin and St. Petersburg Quartet recordings for some really thick, Russian interpretations, or grab Emerson for a fiery live sound.This one just isn't worth it."
1,Horrible Horrible Horrible!,"This is quite possibly the WORST battery charger EVER!I am currently on my 4th unit in the last 4 months!All I am charging with it are 6V Power Wheels batteries, so it ""should"" be no big deal. It keeps crapping out on me, and now I can't return the replacement unit Amazon sent!STAY AWAY from this awful charger!!!"
3,worked fine for one year,"This battery maintainer worked fine for one year, then without me knowing, started to destroy my motorcycle battery. The battery was brand new, and within one year this unit destroyed it. I bought another battery and the maintainer would never seem to get it to full charge very quickly."
1,Junk! Went through 2 in a year,"This product makes you think it's working when it's not. After getting a dead battery, Shumacher made me pay for the 12 dollar shipping. Received the replacement unit, then it went bad right after the year warrentee. Don't waste your time with this one!! I've got a cheap 7 dollar battery maintainer from Harbor Freight that's two years old and still working great."
5,They work great for me,"I bought 2 of these chargers and they have worked great on the batteries in my boat, 4-wheeler, scooter, motorcyles, garden tractors, and stored car. I haven't used it on a 6V battery yet so I don't know how the auto select feature works. I wish they included more plugs for all my vehicles."
2,I Got Charged for No Charge!,"This product was purchased to maintain a charge for my car battery at a vacation property when the auto was garaged and not in use. Worked fine the first year, and second time the 1 year old battery was rendered useless (totally dead and not able to be recharged was teh prognosis) and had to purchase a new battery. Assuming it was the battery and to give the charger the beneift of doubt, the charger was again used only to return to a battery with a very low charge that could not start the vehicle had to be charged with a full service Die Hard charger. Once fully charged, no issue with starting the vehicle - so no other issues. Just for the heck of it, I connected the Schumacher charger to the battery to see if it would show a full charge, and it would just not move from the yellow charging mode. This charger is now officially dead in my opinion and will be replaced with a more reliable one."
2,Dissapointed,"Inexpensive to buy, but this unit had a faulty cord that prevented the battery from charging. Called the manuf after playing wit it for two weeks and found out if you can't show a receipt of purchase they won't stand behind the warranty. You get what you pay for I guess"
3,Dreamy Book,I have a passion for everything french and Versailles holds this fascination. I love the haunted quality of the photographs and the sense that it has been passed by in time and is left as a relic. Very artistic book and quite wonderful.
3,SO - SO,A few good suggestions and some interesting perspectives on what it takes to succeed in the workplace.
2,Disappointed,I have just finished reading How To Be A Star At Work and found in very lengthly and boring. I agree with the other reviewer...there are just three pages worth reading.
1,Disappointed,"I have just finished this book and found it to be very boring and lengthy. I agree with the other reviewer, only three pages worth reading.No idea how anyone that has read this book would give it five stars, if not friends of the author."
4,Great for its Simplicity & Scope,"LEADER AS COACH by David Peterson and Mary Dee Hicks is a quick and easy read specifically beneficial for organizational coaching applications. Some of it's ideas would also be applicable for one-on-one coaching.The book centers around the FIRST acronym. Focus on Priorities, Impliment something every day, Reflect on what happens, Seek feedback and support, and Transfer to the next steps. Each letter of the acronym is then given a ""Strategy"" which amounts more or less to a chapter.The book is very good quality and also is spattered with a variety of usable quotes readers are sure to enjoy. The book would have benefited from further development of each strategy, but what is here is the basis for developing a plan of your own. Not the greatest book on leadership or coaching, but a good easy read with some good information and ideas."
3,Okay but not that great,"I love it when Disney makes crossovers from different shows, and these particular shows, I have watched ""Suite Life on Deck,"" ""Hannah Montana,"" and ""Wizards of Waverly place."" I'm a fan of Wizards and I am glad they were part of this crossover. However, it didn't grab my interest enough to watch it over and over again. It's a show good enough to watch once in a while, but that's for me. If you love it, awesome. That is what truly counts. :)"
4,What 'New York' missed,"This book reveals what, sadly, the recent Burns PBS documentary 'New York' totally ignored; The whole wonderful parade of characters and events that defined the Gilded Age. While the book has flaws (Reggie Vanderbilt was the great-grandson, not grandson, of Commodore Vanderbilt, and J.P. Morgan was not 'the most hated financier' in America) it still does a good job of bringing to life this epochal time. Especially enjoyable are the descriptions of the New York cafe and restaurant society (Emeril eat your heart out!!) that Brady and Lillian Russell were so much a part of. This book is a good starter for those beginning to explore this period. From here then read Strouse's 'Morgan; American Financier', Patterson's 'The Vanderbilts' and Gregory's 'Families of Fortune' and your off to a good start!!"
5,Smart Women,"I never really read and when I do I take my time to find a book I would enjoy to read. I had to find a book to read for an assiment and I choose this one by Judy Blume, I've read many of her books and so far this is one of her best. I didn't want to put it down. It made me think about a lot of things in life. I would tell many of my girl friends to read this book."
1,Stupid Book,"I also had read her original book - ""Margaret"". I was extremely disappointed in this book. It is one of the few books I have not finished reading. It was just simply common trash in my estimation."
3,I heart Blume,"Interesting - not as saucy as her other two adult novels.I enjoyed the book, for the most part. I found Blume's portrayal to be an honest one. I think women are very smart, except when it comes to men. Women stop using their brains and follow their heart, which can lead to heartbreak for others."
4,Parrot in the Oven,Parrot in the Oven is a very interesting book. I liked this book because it talks about alot of things that I am passing for. Like when he wants a glove but he has to work for it. Me too because I want games I have too work for it my mom tells me that we don't have alot of money so if I want something I have to work for it. This book is realy making me see that my mom is saying the true. Another thig that the story tells is when he tries to be a gangster to make more friends and the bad things that hi family is passing for thats why I realy liked this story.Tahts how I relise with the problems that my family is passing for because always do bad stoff like I tried to geat in a gang to make more friens and always be cool but I relise that what I was doing it was wrong becaus I sow how my friends were dieing because the drugs thats way I did not entered that gang. That why I realy liked this book because it almost telling my story that I passed throug.
1,Parrot in The Oven,Parrot in The Oven gets 1 star because it wasn't a attention getter. I liked the book because it was down to earthThe book was alright but I like books that I can't wait to see whats going to happend next.I learned that alcohol is not good for a family bcause it can break up a happy family.But the story's character's seem like every day people.And had every day life situation's Like when Nardo couldn't a job or when his mom and dad fought.But if i would recamend this book to some one Iwould tell my cousin because she like books like this one.
3,RE: Stef,"Just an FYI about the athor, Sarah was a professional music journalist. She worked for spin as a writer and editor for a good number of years... Oh and now she owns a successful little indie label... So I think it's safe to say she's got some cred in the industry... Just thought you should know. The book is a great starter for ipod newbies wanting to expand. It truly is packed full of info, and I agree that the celeb playlists are great. But for those who really have alot of music knowledge, trust your gut, and pick your music on your own. That's what really makes it fun anyway..."
5,For my '05 Dodge Ram Hemi,"Relamped all exterior lamps with these bulbs. This part replaces the tail, reverse, brake and signal bulbs. No problem so far."
4,Not first rate BUT works,"Just below large D rings are two rivets of modest quality. Within 20 seconds of hanging from a horizonal bar, one rivit popped complely out. OOPS. Where is the quality control/quality assurance?Be aware that these are not greatly constructed BUT they appear to be lasting. The D rings are just ordinary quality and other materials will fray over time. Seams okey for now.BUT. Being a regular at the gym and home, you expect home equipment (which these are - they would NEVER be in a gym) to be this level of construction.The price matches the quality but I give 4 stars because they do the job. Just have a couple small bolts/washers/nuts for failing rivet(s). You can easily fix it - not worth RMA or return."
5,"Sturdy, good construction Harbinger Ab Straps","They are approximately 22"" from top of caribiner to the bottom of the straps. They are a little shorter in length than the ones I use at the gym. I think I like the longer length at the gym, but maybe that's just what I'm used to. Nice pair. Good price."
5,Tough stuff!,This thing is built very strong! I am a small person and I am sure it can hold guys much bigger than me. Solid and sturdy. I just wish I actually used it more! This is very important to develop the lower abs. Crunches only get you the upper abs. The economy is tough so I cancelled my gym membership to save a few bucks a month.
1,"The worst ""Cosi"" that I have ever heard","Harnoncourt's ""Don Giovanni"" I find very, very good; ""Marriage of Fogaro"", so so, a very poor Cherubino; but ""Cossi fan Tutte""! that is the worst that I have ever heard. What happened to that glorious music?, to the magnificence of the human voice, etc? Who can ever think of looking for psicological aspects in the story? It is just a joke, and even a nasty joke, but leave the music alone Mr. Harnoncourt, respect it, please. Thank you."
5,ingenious,"I am considered ingenious about words and rhymes, but this author and book go places I never dreamt. A fun read too."
4,The Missing Center,"Started out great, as usual with Ms Tepper. However, on reaching page 161, up popped a short story or something entitled, ""All Flesh is Clay,"" followed on page 168 by ""Twenty-two and Absolutely Free"" and on page 190 by ""Hooked On Buzzer"" which ended on page 192 with the reappearance of The Awakeners' page 193.What I read was fine but the missing 30 pages ruined it. Obviously the publisher, Orb, ripped you off as well as me"
1,Twice failed!!!,If there was a 0 star rating I would have gave that! I bought the Irish dancing video as a gift to my granddaughters. It was a huge disappointment when they opened the wrapped DVD box and it didn't have a DVD inside. I reported it and Amazon sent a second one. Yes there was a DVD in the box this time and it doesn't work in the DVD player. Sad granddaughter faces again :(. Now I'm sick of dealing with it!
1,This dvd is as meaningless as the production behind it,"Of course, if you are looking for ABSOLUTELY nothing you're sure to find it...similar to believing there is no GOD....there is NO DVD in this case...but if you are a good dancer you can make up your own moves...and PRETEND something exists."
2,disappointed that they didn't make it like the original,"I bought this because I was so fond of the original in my youth, but was dismayed to realize it was different than the original. It should have been a no-brainer to make it like the original. To me, no kickoff at the start of the third quarter and a turnover on an incomplete pass are bizarre screw ups. How can you possibly mess this classic up?Among the other differences are a terrible screen and different sound effects than the original on touchdowns, field goals and safeties, which I can live with.The only thing I can think that caused Mattel to mess this up is cost. Classic Basketball is way better; the screen is great! If they can get it right on basketball, why not on football 2? Now if Mattel would only recall the football 2 units, fix these things and reissue it. I'll pay more for it if cost is the issue."
5,Divertido,Lo mejor que puede haber para el entretenimiento y lo mejor es que es totalmente retro y hace que recuerde mi niñes :)
3,Something missing . . . ?,"I was short shipped on this order and received only the 9th symphony. Thus my rating is based on the one symphony -- but it is the 9th symphony so it should have been better. Overall the audio quality was not quite up to current state-of-the-art standards; it wasn't horrible either. Some sections were very rushed. At one point you could tell a horn player was gasping for breath. However, the final choral section was brilliant, and brought the whole affair to a nice conclusion. I assume the other symphonies of the Harnoncourt set bring up the rating for this cycle, but this version of the 9th was lacking. I compared it to my other version of the 9th by Staatskapelle Dresden, Herbert Blomstedt. I was stunned at how much more earthy and moving the bass sections were in the Blomstedt recording. Clearly there was something missing in the Harnoncourt version of the 9th. I highly recommend the Staatskapelle Dresden, Herbert Blomstedt set of the 9 symphonies."
5,Boyz Rule,"I really enjoyed this movie. I've been wanting to see it for a really long time, but according to most reviews I've read opinion's have been that this movie was a bit pedophilic if you're an adult that's watching it, which of course made me very hesitant. I'm happy my curiosity out weighed my hesitance because this movie was really good. I didn't experience any of the ""uncomfortable, shocking, shameful"" moment's that many other viewers claimed to have while watching this movie. Everyone has their own opinion's and the only one that counts is your own ;) I loved this movie and i would recommend it to anyone interested in love and coming of age stories."
2,Not so good,I try to use the finder but didn't work.The person who is listening to me sometimes didn't hear well.
4,Great headset with some small cons,"This headset performs exceptionally well for such a light device. It's almost so small that you can lose track of it in a pocket. Even comes with a carrying case!Battery life is very good, and speaker volume was actually too high at times (but easily adjusted). When speaking with other people, they were able to hear me very clearly. Occasionally, the noise canceling would cut off my voice if I was too quiet. When driving in a car, this happened rather frequently.In short, this headset is an absolute bargain whose only drawback may be with regard to operating in noisy environments. The Jawbone may be better at managing noise, but it's far more expensive. Get this if you're looking for a deal."
1,Dead after four months.,Worked fine until it stopped working. I Could hear ok but all the other person could hear was a faint voice. Four months usage. Won't buy another of this brand.
4,"We recognize the hooks, Mika. But it's still derned good fun.","For those of us who found our muse in the 80s, much of this album will sound eerily familiar. Whether that's a good or bad thing is up for debate. In the layers of visuals, we see Yellow Submarine. In the familiar hooks of the songs we hear the Gibbs, Freddy, John and Paul, maybe a little Benny and Bjorn, Bowie, and Sir Elton. But I have to admit his execution is no less than masterful. I really enjoy this album. I think Mika may have what it takes to fill the void left by the passing of the greats. His vocals are good and will only get stronger over the nex 5-10 years. He's a true song smith who I believe will also grow into his own original form -- he's already there in some ways. Here's hoping he can stay focused on the art as his popularity swells. Welcome Mika."
4,A fun album,This is a great album. I bought it because of Grace Kelly but honestly all of the songs are great.
1,Mika,His voice is so annoying and high. I don't understand why he is getting talked about. This album is horrible.
4,I LOVE Mika...amazing!!!!!,"Mika is amazing. I could not get the ""Grace Kelly"" song out of my head for weeks. I bought the CD over a year ago and I still listen to it at least 8x a week. His voice is so amazing, his lyrics are catchy and hilarious, and he plays the piano so well. I love his look and the fact that his sister created his CD cover is really touching.He has not said anything about his sexuality but I have to say if you are not open to all kinds of music you probably won't like him.ALL my friends LOVE this CD and whenever I introduce him to someone they want to play his entire CD over and over and over. His songs are just so positive and happy it puts me in a great mood. The only reason I do not give him 5 stars is because there are about 3 songs that are somewhat slow and dull. But overall I can't wait to hear more from him.I do not think he is a rip off of Queen at all. It is obvious that he created his style of music based on that but they are VERY different. Love Love Love him!!!!"
5,Hello...no reference to Scissor Sisters?,"After reading a majority of the reviews saying that Mika sounds a lot like Freddie Merecury and the Bee Gees, everyone failed to mention Mika sounds exactly like Scissor Sisters. I love this CD , but i'm a bit disappointed that he sounds exactly like Scissor Sisters who i love very much. But i'll still give this CD a 5 stars. Great songs and catchy beats...the bonus song is great...RING RING. Enjoy!!!"
5,I wish I were a cartoon,"If you haven't purchased this CD yet, do yourself a favour and run to get it.Mika's CD is indeed ""music to your ears"". The much anticipated release of this CD does not dissappoint. I bought a copy the day of it's release and it has been on non-stop play on my stereo since then. From the first to the last track Mika takes you on a bubble gum journey, that is sure to amuse you, and not take yourself as seriously. This is one of those CD's that you once you press play, makes you just want to dance around in your living room, in your underwear. Go get it..."
4,Some Great Music....,Mika has a way of blending Ol School Bubble Gum Pop with a new style & sound that is refreshing to the ears. Not to mention that I think he is easy on the eyes too.....Go Mika !!
4,Great head voice warm ups,"This book /CD is worth the price just for the first 20 minutes of warm ups. Mr. Stone is an excellent teacher, and I use these exercises with my vocal jazz students. They're very helpful for female students who tend to push the chest voice, encouraging the head voice approach from above, and there are challenging tempos and scale figures. The playbacks sound pretty corny, due to the synth/ piano but he chose good titles."
4,mecha king Ghidorah is in the house,"When i got this I was so excited the wings rotated and the legs to, but not the heads or tails. then i noticed that the wings were bent and it was hard to get it to stay unbent after i fixed it, it kept bending back so finally after much frustration, i gave up and let it be, the wings also like to pop out out of their sockets.But the frustration was worth adding it to my collection."
5,An exceptional production,"An exceptional production. Jean Matthews' RISE OF THE NEW WOMAN provides a history of the women's movement in America between 1875-1930. This was the period which brought about fundamental changes in the lives and opportunities of American women: chapters show how women gained access to all levels of education and achievement, and how they struggled against doors still shut to their abilities."
4,Amber in color,"I needed some bulk 3157 bulbs, and these are exactly what you would buy at many autoparts stores and dealerships. I should have paid more attention to the description, NA designates ""natural amber"", however the picture provided by the seller was of a clear bulb. I of course received the amber bulbs, no big deal for aprox 5 bucks, it was really my fault for not reading completely, but annoying"
5,Great camera necessity!,The solution works great! I was able to clean my camera and got all the little cotton and dirt messes stuck in there from outdoor lens changes when needed.
5,Unbelievable deal for the money,"After reading the reviews I decided to purchase one of these. I am very impressed with the quality. Real heavy. Feels more like a Bosch for a lot less money. Very precise trigger. Heck, you couldn't buy the battery pack for this kind of money. BUY ONE !!!"
5,Swing Swing Swing,"This is what a big band is all about.This is the greatest band ever.When I was a kid in the 50's we would dance or stand infront of the bandstand for hours on the pier in Old Orchard Beach,Maine with the Basie Band,you could not sit down.Now I'm 66, so I crank up Home Theater sound system withthe 43"" wide screen and let my foot tap. Life is good!"
1,Orange,"Unlike the other reviews, it turned me orange, I sparkle like freaking Edward Cullen, and I smell like a wet dog. I am not happy with this product."
5,"Subtle, just as described","This product got my very white, nearly translucent legs to a sunkissed color just in time for a wedding I was attending. I used it once a day, after showering, for a week then twice a day for three or four days and it most definitely made a difference that I was very pleased with. I was apprehensive about getting a product like this, not knowing if my legs would turn out oompa loompa like, but it looked very natural. My legs ended up matching my arms that already had a light, natural tan. I would recommend this product to anyone with fair skin and I will most certainly be using it again."
2,"Not perfect, but helpful","There is certainly a need for secondary literature to describe a complex standard such as the CMMI. This book does a reasonable job to accomplish this. As it has been stated there are certainly weaknesses. For example the ratio between actual content and number of pages is in some areas pretty bad. One citation an the start of a chapter is nice, two is an over load. In order to gain a fair understanding of the CMMI standard is not sufficient and neither is this book. However, ""CMMI Distilled"" gets you a step closer."
4,Pretty Nifty!,"Like this ""Top of the Line"" Leatherman. Only complaint, it came with a belt clip & also a lanyard loop plus a handful of various screwdriver bits but no pocked or sheath for them in the case. They will soon sink into the bottom of a drawer somewhere never to be seen again. Shipping loose accessories to support a sheath tool makes about as much sense as a cast iron golfer on a flagpole during a thunder storm!The good part... This tool is heavy duty from stem to stern. Nicely made and a pleasure to show off for any outdooorsman. First factory sharpened knife blades that really are sharp.A pleasure to own & a great gift for an out doors man that couldn't or wouldn't spent this kind of money for a leatherman for himself but appreciates real quality. Great!!"
4,Charge TTi,"Great multitool with a good selection of useful blades and tools. Holster is a good fit, but can prove a bit too bulky on the belt/waist."
5,great leatherman,"Awesome! Overall it's a great product. I havn't owned a Leatherman previously but I'm very satisfied with this one. The TTi does it all, especially with all the additional bits that it comes with. If you have it on you and someone needs a tool you probably have it. I've used it while helping some buddies move (screw drivers/allens etc.), working in fiber optics, electrical, random tasks around the house. I havn't used everything everything yet but it I need it I've got it. Pretty sweet tool."
4,Modelling putty,"I purchased this to use as a filler putty for scale model building. It works alot better than Squadron Green Stuff - is not as gritty and it feathers out alot better. It does shrink however, so build up thick areas in multiple coats. I'd sure buy it again - but this huge tube will probably be a lifetime investment as I'm 61!!"
5,A Thief in the Night,"Lynley Dodd fans may know Slinky Malinki as one of the cats that gets chased in HAIRY MACLARY SCATTERCAT. In this book we learn all about the midnight-black cat with the kink in the end of its tail.Slinky is a nice cat as long as the sun is shining. But once the sun goes down and the night darkens, he prowls the neighborhood as a literal cat burglar. Nothing is safe as the feline rapscallion makes off with whatever he wants. Then one night he goes too far and steals far more than usual. Slinky gets caught by his family and is eternally shamed.This is an interesting book and rather different from the Hairy MacLary books. This tail offers an example of rehabilitation. Having been caught and shamed, the cat refuses to give in to the desire to steal at night. They say a leopard can not change its spots but this cat definitely does. Check it out."
2,I was disappointed...,"In every chapter Ms. DeLong talks about all the evil white males that she is pursuing and working besides. A personality conflict with a boss is turned into a sexist hate campaign by Ms. DeLong. One of the reasons I bought this book was to read about the UNABOM case and instead we find out all she did was watch a bus stop. Then the reader is treated with her lover spats that she had with her FBI lover during her four month stake out of the bus stop.However, this book does go into the politics of government law enforcement and shows the black and white thinking that most government law enforcement agents have. Ms DeLong was not a model FBI agent and was forced into retirement."
1,So. Painful.,"There are some books that you can read and reread, over and over again, and they never lose their freshness and fun. Then there are derivative books, written by committee seventy years after the original, that give you a funny feeling in the inside of the back of your neck when you read them, and make you want to go in through your eye sockets with a grapefruit spoon to scratch that feeling. Guess which type this is?"
4,Small claims court,A good reference for anyone going to small claims court gives details of state laws in most states.Very well written.
4,Very Soft!,"The slipcover is very soft and cozy and because it's a thinner material, it tucks into the couch easily. But, because it's a slipcover, it does slip out at times and have to be readjusted and tucked. Of all the slipcovers I have tried, this one is definitely the best. The red color is more a dark cranberry, not a true red."
3,OK but not great,This cover is ok but not great. I probably would not buy it again but not because of it's quality. It just doesn't fit my sofa. My sofa is just like the one in the picture so I don't think that is the problem. The problem is the length from the edge of the back to the edge of the front. It is too short and therefore it is difficult to keep it tucked in. Otherwise it is made of great quality fabric and washes up well. I can also spot clean it with a Tide Stick and the spots disappear.
3,Dull,"Candace Cameron plays 16-year-old Sharon who has just killed her parents. Because she's in a catatonic state, Dr. O'Connor (Mel Harris) is brought in to examine her and determine whether she's faking it or what's causing it. Lots of family secrets get revealed pushing the story along, but it all seems pretty tame. The production is also second rate. About halfway through this flick we start to lose interest fast."
5,Love it,"I have downloaded this album for MP3, but have an older car, so I also just bought the disc for my car. I wish he would do some more albums in Italian and French. Love it, so soulful."
3,Canto Gino Vannelli,I did not like this album at all. If I had heard it I would not have purchased it. I can appreciate the effort it takes to make a CD but......I will be giving it to the first person I encounter who likes it.
3,Fun fades after a few days,"The game works great and has a good variety of songs to choose from but each 'dance' is only about 1 min 45 seconds, so you have to stop at each song and choose a new song. After a while, it gets annoying and the songs get old too. We had fun for a few days after Christmas but now the box sits unused. We will likely break it out from time to time. I bought it for my 7 year old who couldn't do it even on the 'easy' level. She didn't really like it. The adults had more fun. The 'hard' level is just ridiculously difficult. You'd have to practice for days on end to get it.Big positive is the uplifting lyrics in the songs."
2,It's not DDR,It's hard to ddr with the arrows going in the opposite direction - it was easy to learn the other way. My Mom is bummed that I'm not playing. Good music - why can't they make it as easy to dance as ddr?
3,Full of difficult words,"This book has good words for first 100 pages, then later this book becomes tedious to read. Because each sentence has three to four tough words. This book is for people who have good command over English language. Also the words used in this book are hardly used in everyday english. Don't waste your money."
5,Help find the money I needed,"Bought this book and the authors' other book ""The Directory of Venture Capital"" and found the money I needed. Previous review is right, the first reviewer obviously didn't read thisbook. It's to the point, no bull. But it if you're looking for money but don't know where to turn or how to go about it"
1,I give up,"I used to respect Mr. Butler's work. I was a big fan of ""Good Scent"" and especially of ""They Whisper."" But this is yet another superficial, lightweight offering. It makes me sad to see a once-great author sinking to such depths. Anyone interested should go back and read the old works. They had some real magic to them. The last few books are all just dead weight, a finished author plowing ahead simply because he's expected to. I wish I could say something more nuanced and objective. But this is just a depressing last straw. I am finished with Mr. Butler from here on in."
5,Great photos and easy to understand text,"This book finally showed me how to shoot nudes using infrared film. The text is clear and easy to understand, so that I could apply what I learned to shooting the nude with this unique film. The author details exposures, filters,lighting, focusing, developing and precautions. The stunning portfolio of infrared nudes truly inspires one to emulate the author's results. I congratulate Mr. Paduano on writing a book on infrared that photographer's can put to use and on the brilliant work he does in b&w infrared!"
4,Wondrous Strange,"This novel is indeed wondrous strange. Rooted in history, peopled by historical characters, resplendent with magical realism; this is a journey through times, attitudes, and obsessions that end fantistically but believably. Mr. Adrian's sure touch took me into a spiritualist reality that jostled but somehow never upset the grounding of army camps, battlefields, and the streets, hospitals, and drawing rooms of Civil War era America. Family, memory, grief, blood, and the inventiveness of humanity are the bedrock of this story; and anyone who has pondered the ultimate mystery of death will find something here. Mr. Adrian's action proceeds from character, and that is the solid ground of this novel. Of course the action would unfold in just this way, the characters demand it. I highly recommend ""Gob's Grief,"" you will finish it as if waking from a dream - all wondrous and strange."
2,"Surreal, Sad Story (and way too long!)","Lovely writing but the story is beyond bizarre. As others have noted, the short story - the first section of the book - is by far the best. The many characters are all self absorbed, morbid and slightly (or mostly) crazy. The Civil War camp and battle scenes offer poignant realism in what otherwise is an overly long trudge through endless introspection, depression, personal alienation and grief. These themes, expressed by numerous characters, are so repetitive that I finally just gave up and skipped to the end - which I personally did not find redeeming. A promising writer, certainly, but I agree with those who have said that this should have remained a powerful short story rather than a hopelessly morbid and convoluted novel."
2,Not Easy. Not Impressed.,thought this would be a step by step how to but its more for intermediate to advanced learners. very disappointed
4,First-rate!,"This is an excellent book for any beginning artist or anyone else wanting to learn cartooning. Chris Hart publishes some of the best books on art that I've ever seen. This book gives good details on drawing that is easy to follow and understand. All in all, this is one book that should be in every artist's library."
4,I know it's punk but...,"At long last this classic album is released on cd. The material doesn't need to be reviewed - it's A1. The re-issue however...Well, the packaging is nice, and it appears to be a legit re-issue licensed from Poshboy, but the sound is TERRIBLE. Too much high end! It's my guess this was poorly mastered from a cassette. What a waste! You're better off seeking out ""Four Days In A Motel Room"", which has cleaner sound and it contains roughly half of this disc. Hopefully, Poshboy will cough up the masters and do this classic record justice for a US release."
2,Quick delivery- bad quality of binding,"Delivery was good and in time; however, after using the book for exactly a month, I noticed that the page binding is not rigid. Bearing in mind that I take specific care of all my books, especially those for my academic work, I consider it unacceptable that some pages are about to go away! This is the first time in my life that something like this is happening"
2,"OK for beginners, but too general for many.","As one who has had a number of attorneys over a long lifetime, I found the book disappointing. I was looking for ""something new"" and did not find it."
2,Great until you use it,"I bought one of these for a Scuba Trip to Key Largo. Originally I was going to purchase two, one for me and one for my roommate, but after reading the reviews decided on one and that if it was great once it arrived I would order another.First of all the knife itself is attractive, has a hard plastic handle and the release worked well. We were thrilled with it and I gave it to my roommate to wear while were were diving.The first day of diving went well, no problems with it. We got back to the hotel and soaked everything to get the salt off of it. The knife was washed in the sink and towel dried. The next morning the blade had started to rust. I was extremely disappointed in this fact, that after a single use the blade was rusted.I did not end up purchasing a second knife."
2,Not too smooth,I have been using a similar product from Trader Joe's but bought this product at a World Foods store which is nearer to me. This product is not as good as the Trader Joe's Shaving Cream. The razor does not glide across your face as easily. I find that I have to go back and forth several times to receive a decent shave. This in turn leaves some irritation.Since we do not have a Trader Joe's store near us in Florida I was glad to see that I could order their product here on-line at Amazon. I will not by the Alba product again.Trader Joe's Honey Mango Moisturizing Shave Cream with Aloe Vera and Vitamin E for Men and Women
3,"Good, but too thick and too strongly scented","Pretty decent product, but it is very strongly scented and is actually a bit too thick. It is hard to evenly spread the cream over a large area (like legs) and the razor blades get clogged with cream after each swipe-- which is hard to rinse out of the blades for continued use."
1,"Great smell, does nothing for shaving","Let me just say that this cream, for all you potential purchasers out there, is a lather-less cream. It will not lather at all and goes on clear. It did seem to moisturize, but while shaving it offered no help to let the razor glide over my face. The razor actually had more drag with this product than when using even the cheapest of the canned shaving creams. It didn't cost much so I can't be truly upset about my purchase, but I will not be using it again. For a wonderful product in this price range, check out the Kiss My Face moisture shave products. They lather up very well and offer a very enjoyably smooth shave."
4,N.1 on Italian Dance Charts during Summer 2000,"N.1 on Italian Dance Charts during Summer 2000 - really good song, and really good remixes!"
2,Not Necessary,"This product is definitely not a neccessity. The wipes stay warm once unplugged for about an hour only, and it's way too big for a travel case. There is also a too-long cord that hangs off of the case, it's really annoying. It would have made more sense to have it unplug directly from the case."
1,"Skeptical yes, well researched and argued, no.","Like many debunkers, this book is highly selective in case material, presenting those which favor the skeptical argument, while ignoring much of the evidence that cannot be convincingly explained away. Like other reviewers, I found that he merely skimmed the surface of such cases. Overall, this book adds little of value to the debate."
5,Excellent Product It does what is advertised,"What more is there to say about this quality Battery charger? Easy to read, easy to use, the case is made of METAL not plastic. It works and it is reliable. I'm really thinking this is an excellent value for the money."
1,NO MORE,"RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX, THE 12V-6 AMP WORKED, BUT THE 12V-2 AMP, AND 6 VOLT DID NOT. I HAVE HAD TO RETURN THE LAST 5 OR 6 ELECTRICAL ITEMS THAT I HAVE PURCHASED THAT WERE MADE IN CHINA, (SOME FROM AMAZON, SOME FROM WALMART ONLINE ), BUT NET RESULT IS THEY ARE NON FUCHTIONAL RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX. THESE ITEMS ARE ABSOLUTELY NOT TESTED AFTER PRODUCTION. BOTH SALES OUTLETS ARE GOOD ABOUT RETURNS, BUT I AM TIRED OF BOXING THINGS BACK UP AND SENDING THEM BACK. THE CHARGER ALSO HAS NO ON/OFF SWITCH SO BE SURE TO UNPLUG IT AFTER USAGE. I AM DONE BUYING ELECTRICAL ITEMS ONLINE."
5,Loved it!,Its Awesome!! I myself am a huge Geek foe X men and just about all Marvel Comics! This is just what I wanted to see to relive my childhood in the 90's as a child! Very Happy!! :3
4,Good case if you do your homework,"This case is excellent for my application - Windows Home Server using an Intel Atom 330 processor board, 2 - 1TB drives, headless and stuck in a closet. Draws 45 W and runs 24/7."
1,HOT! HOT! HOT! As in OVERHEAT!!,"Everything about the Cube is great... except for one very important, vital, and absolutely necessary thing - Cooling. This box runs very hot, very quickly. That's because of two issues: poor venting and a cramped interior where the DVD drive sits right on top of the cpu fan. A bigger cpu fan won't work because the space won't allow it. Cranking the fan speed to max only help slightly. Installed extra fan, but didn't help. CPU temp at 40c after about 30 mins and keeps going up. If ever there is a case that needs side and back venting, lots of it, this is it. But the only opening is a small area at the top of the case where the airflow is blocked by the DVD drive. I run a dual-core E2180, I'm sure an older CPU would not generate as much heat, but what's the point? On the plus side, the Cube can double as a heater if you run it long enough."
4,Start and Run a Profitable Tour Guiding Business,"a simple,easy to read book with lots of helpful information on operating a tour business."
5,"Betty Crocker Cookbook: Everything You Need to Know to Cook Today, New Tenth Edition","I purchased this cookbook for my granddaughter's 24th birthday. It has lots of basic information for learning to cook, but also is excellent for quick reference on most cooking questions. She will be starting out on her own soon and was delighted with this choice."
5,Betty Crocker Red Cookbook,"This was a wedding gift. It was in the bridal registery at Bed,Bath and Beyond. It was about $8 cheaper thru Amazon! Gift came in excellent condition, on time. Very pleased."
3,Good but different from original,"This book is very nicely put together with many pictures and recipes. However the recipes are pretty different from the original BC book. The meatloaf recipe is completely different- much less oil, salt, etc. I guess if you are trying to eat healther than this would be great. Also, i didnt see a recipe for a basic fried pork chop!"
1,More practice needed,"This collection is basically rubbish. It's not worth $3.99. The performers are far below the standard that should be required to record music - the version of Recuerdos de la Alhambra is a notable low point in an otherwise mediocre selection. Good on them for having a go, but this sort of performance should stay in the practice room. I feel robbed and I'm sure anyone else who bought the CD would too."
3,Not as good as the N64 game,"It's a decent james bond game, WAIT, O YEA, You're not James Bond! That Blows! Apparently you're some bad MI6 agent with a mysterious gold eye that has special powers. Thats kinda stupid but I do have to give them props for bringing it back to FPS instead of that third person crap. This isn't as good as the N64 version, actually this game has nothing to do with the original goldeneye. Pros: 1. Its back to a FPS 2. Good Songs 3. Xbox live 4. Duel wielding Cons: 1. You're not James Bond 2. Its not really spy, its more run and gun 3. The story line sucks 4. It has nothing to do with the original goldeneye"
2,NOT A BOND GAME,"This is not an average bond game. If you liked nightfire or everything or nothing, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! sure you get to take enemies hostage and thow them off buildings, but its pointless! I made a big mistake buying this game. If you want a good action shooter get a Tom Clancy game. I'm not even sure if you can even do a splitscreen multiplayer with this game!"
2,Rogue Agent leaves much to be desired!!,Ok one of my fraternity brothers bought this game and I had asked for it for christmas. I played a few levels in first player and it seemed promising. Then some of the guys brought their controllers in to play multiplayer. This is where the game really let me down. The levels are choppy and the controls are very delayed.... not the fast action of Halo. There are some neat traps within the multiplayer levels but doesn't make up for the terrible game play. Main idea of this review is to let the other people know that they should stick to Halo or better yet Halo 2....
4,Magical!,"This is one of the best kids movies out there. My kids watch it daily! The songs are catchy and stick with you. This is one of those stories that could be told on stage, in a book or on film. Great family movie, we all love it. Max is very determined and bold.."
5,"I.M. Healthy Soynut Butter, Original Creamy, 15-Ounce Plastic Jars (Pack of 6)","I have to say I was rather scared to try this not really knowing what I was going to get but I am so glad that I took the risk and tried this product. It tastes just like peanut butter only not as sweet or rich. I loved its mild flavor so much, it has a great texture and the smell is so inviting. Before buying online I would check your local health food stores first, just to make sure you like it, everyone has different tastes but all I can say is I am going to use this instead of peanut butter from now on. YUM! The nutrition facts are off on this product though, I have the same jar at home and for 2T it has 200 calories and 14 grams of fat, so thats a little confusing but I am going to trust what is on the actualy jar then what amazon is telling me here. FYI"
4,I think this is a great toy,I bought this metal detector with some birthday money. I have had it for almost two years now and it still works great. My brother and his friends left it in the back yard for almost a week and it rained a few times and I thought it was broken but my mom put in new batteries and it still works great! I haven't found anything valuable either but to me it's fun finding junk and who knows maybe some day I will. I really like it and think it was worth [the money]. It's old and used alot and it still looks and works great.
2,Outer Banks Flop!,"We purchased this metal detector for my 7 year old son to take on vacation. He took it to the beach twice, but never used it. I feel that it may be better suited for children who are ages 6 and younger."
5,fantastic,"This product worked exactly as described, shipping seemed a bit slower than I've experienced in the past. However it was half the price that I could buy it for in the local box store. So it well worth a bit of a wait."
1,Did not fit for 2001 Cavalier,"I bought this for my 2001 Cavalier that I was installing a new receiver in. Metra's site listed this as one of the parts compatible with my car, so that's why I chose it. However, the end for the factory antenna connector to go into is too small and it won't fit."
5,good stuff,came in like 2 days. Very sturdy and durable. If i need another i would buy again. Great stuff. Fits my 04 colorado.
1,lousy book,I have read half a dozen books on the topic of sex magicand this was by far the worst of them.This book rambles on and on. It does not get to the pointin a clear and crisp fashion. This book lacks clear instructions for any specific action regarding sexual magic. This book is more of a dictionary of various religions. Its a jack of all trades and master of none. It rambles on and on without defining any of the systems covered in a clear meaningful fashion. This book was so poorly written that I failed to get anything out ofit
5,Stunning!,"I was lucky enough to spend three days in the Napa Valley twenty years ago and I've always wished that my family and I had spent more time there than in San Francisco. But now, thanks to Charles Feil and Ernest Rose, I can go back to Napa again and again and again.Stunning is the only adjective that accurately describes the photographs in this wonderful coffee table book. From ""a churning sea of fog (that) floods the landscape"" to hot air balloon drifting over the Valley and the delightful changes of the seasons, Napa Valley---A View from Above takes viewers on their own little vacation to paradise!Wine lovers, artists, nature lovers and everyone in between will enjoy the small inscription of the seven regions and the many wineries that make California a top-notch competitor for wines, romance, climate and sheer beauty with the most enviable regions of France and Italy.Come, put your feet up, and take a mini-vacation right there on your couch and enjoy the fabulous views of Napa Valley!"
3,barbie bike radio,"Radio does not get many stations, poor reception. Anntenea is flimsy too, can easily break."
4,jump box,This will replace the previous one that I owned.Great for a back up when you own recreational watercraft etc. that sometimes require a jump.
5,Wonderful,This is a great medium sized mortar and pestle. It is well made and grinds things efficiently. It is pretty enough to display in your kitchen at all times.
1,"Packing is so poor, it arrived BROKEN!!","I want a replacement, but I have to return this one, and pay postage. This is a lot of bother for their lack of common sense. This was packaged in a box, without any protection.Don't order this product or from this seller."
4,Get the budget edition,"Very fine program and performances with excellent sound. Add half a star for the ""apex"" reissue at $6.98:Britten: The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra; Four Sea Interludes"
3,thank you for arguing,"This is a not so scholarly list of rhetorical techniques. It is humorous, superficial and like a salesman's seminar"
4,Thank You for Arguing,"Thank you for arguing is a fun way to learn about the art of communication. Heinrichs really makes a point of using himself in examples and actual ways to apply persuasive speaking. You don't have to reread his thoughts, they are clear and to the point which makes learning all that easier!!I would recommend this book."
1,Too Thick,"This fabric softener is too thick. It stays in my fabric softener dispenser in my washer for 4 or 5 loads, sometimes longer. Most times I end up having to just clean it out of the dispenser. It smells great and I love that it's safe, but it's not worth it if it doesn't do what it's supposed to."
3,For recreation only,"If you're looking for something to reach the back of an audience with, this won't cut it. It's mainly for home use or for kids or for use in a casual drum circle. All in all, a lot of fun!"
5,The Rake is a romance with depth and substance.,"All of Mary Jo Putney's romance novels are extraordinary in terms of their depth, substance,and human feeling. The Rake is an excellent example. A Regency rake decides to stop the hard drinking that men of his class habitually indulge in--and finds it almost impossible in a time before alcoholism was understood. This unusual romance hero and the equally unexpected heroine, who holds down a man's job, inhabit a novel that is a definite keeper."
3,I Really Wanted to Like This Book a Lot More,"There were some aspects of this book that I found very, very good. Putney writes well and her characters are fairly well-developed. I enjoyed the building of the friendship between the hero and heroine and the respect that they demonstrate for one another. What put me off, though, is that I kept feeling like I was being brought to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. I don't have a problem when a book has an underlying theme intended to make the reader examine herself. But as I read this book, I felt like Putney was trying to indoctrinate me into the philosophy of AA (and I'm not even a drinker!!!) more than she was trying to spin a romantic tale. The message was just a little too heavy-handed for me, and the book leaves me questioning whether I want to try reading any of Putney's other books."
3,Good but not great,"I was rather disappointed with this book given the great reviews. It might have been my mood but I didn't feel emotionally connected to the characters or the pain and desperation that they went through, I couldn't feel Reggie's despair, the heart of the emotional ride for this book. I was looking forward to reading this, as flawed characters are always much more interesting but for some reason I just couldn't feel anything for the characters and without that I couldn't like the book as much.I liked that Putney is able to write about an alcoholic hero, and the heroine is certainly also a little different. After reading a few of Putney's books (the last I read was One Perfect Rose), her writing style appears to be fairy tale like with the ending tying up everything very neatly (almost too neatly) into happy endings not just for the main characters but for secondary, even tertiary characters as well."
1,Parmegiano is moldy,"I expected a very special vacuum-package, but it arrived and seems to be a lazy hand made vacuum-package. I haven't opened the package yet but I can look a ""green mold"" over one side of the Parmegiano. I'm really afraid to open an unknown mold that arrived in this delivery. In fact if my package arrived with some ""green bread mold"" in the Parmegiano, think on the room they packaged the other deliveries, the spores flying around that site... awful.The bottom line, I will not buy neither a piece of bread from this provider."
2,Not what I ordered!,"I ordered both 28-month-aged Parmigiano Reggiano and Parmigiano Reggiano Stravecchio (3 Year Top Grade). What did I get? Both of them were exactly the same. No difference, in fact the label doesn't even say how many months it has been aged. It could be 6 months old for all I know. Looks to me like no matter what you order, you get the same ""generic"" parmesan cheese. In fact I doubt it was 28 or 36 months old because it was semi-hard, like a common swiss cheese, and had very little of the crystals that grow on it as it ages.The taste was ok, but nothing to jump up and down about, and certainly not worth what I paid for it. In fact I've gotten better Parmigiano Reggiano from the local supermarket!Needless to say, I'm very disappointed and won't be ordering any more of this."
4,Great Learning Tool and Lots of Fun,I have a two year old that loves to find the objects and peg them with the pegs. This game is teaching him so much about information gathering and problem solving. It's also helping to strengthen his index finger and thumb through the action of holding and placing the pegs correctly. Soon he'll be able to hold crayons and other writing devices correctly. I always play this game with my son. The game is really for older children but we had so much fun playing it at another friend's house that we had to buy it. The only suggestion I would have is to make the pegs bigger so they can't be swallowed by toddlers.
4,a great piece!,"I found this used one with reasonable price. It looks like a new one. Though it takes a little bit longer to get the shipment , that is ok. I will keep looking to find some more."
4,Nice Book,"This is a nice book to add to your photography collection, but if you are starting out dont use this as a beginners guide. He goes into detail of which camera he uses, the lighting techniques, and why he poses the models the way he did. The models and the shots are nice, but if you are just starting out, dont try to use this as a guide."
4,Tim Allen (highs and lows),"Tim Allen is one of the very few and funny comedians today. This book called ""Tim Allen"" is very good to read and has a lot of interesting facts about Tim Allen. It is a short book to read, and it is written by John Wukovits.For people who would like to know everything from head to toe about Tim Allen, this book is a pretty good one to check out. I enjoyed it very much because Tim has always been one of my favorite comedians. It tells quite a few things in detail about his life, what he has done in the past, and how he is living today. I would recommend this book to people who like comedy and stories that include flashbacks.This is a very interesting, and I enjoyed it very much. I think others will, too."
2,"Needs a seventh season, possibly an eighth.","Unless ABC gives us two additional seasons to finish the series as it should be finished, don't bother. Just watch the first season (the strongest, anyway) and the finale. The rest is just tons and tons of questions of things that Carlton Cuse & Damon Lindelof thought would be cool and then never bothered to answer. The list of open questions and plotholes after watching the finale is mind-numbing. So, avoid watching hundreds of hours of TV for nothing. First season + Finale will tell you all you need to know, and all they managed to tell us.What a disappointment this was, after all these years."
5,Awesome show,Awesome show full of great actors and a great mystery and full of excitement and adventure. The complete collection is just a bonus.
2,Is it worth it?,"Having bought all the previous 5 seasons on Blu-ray (and payed over 200, almost 300usd) i am really not sure if its a good choice to pay almost the same money again to receive only a couple of Kids Menu items. I think not. Studios should consider giving discounts for previously purchased seasons. I have already paid for the royalties and other rights of the 5 seasons and paying an extra 150 usd (Complete BR set price minus 6th season BR price) for a fancy box which will occupy extra space on my movie rack is illogical. (2 stars goes for the product set, not the series)"
5,Items in great shape and great deal compared to other online sites,I got this product and was so excited! The excitement only continued after I opened the almost untouched package. It was like buying it fresh from Best Buy. The materials inside and the extras were wonderfully crafted in true LOST fashion. One of the best things I've ever gotten from Amazon
5,Great Gift,"I bought this as a gift for my husband (a ""Lost"" fanatic!) for Christmas. He about had a heart attack when he unwrapped it. As he started opening the package, we found it had many ""Lost"" attributes and hidden fun stuff. I think this is a great purchase for any person that loves ""Lost"" and all the mystery that surrounds it."
4,Very good set,"This is a very great show from start to finish. I got this product on sale and it was worth it just for the extra bonus features. The box really isn't anything special but like I said, there is over 2 hours of bonus features that don't come in other sets. They interest me so I am really happy with my purchase"
5,Definitely Unique and Great for True Lost Fans,"I love the packaging for the series and am happy that this isn't a limited or special edition pack. This set is for true Lost fans, it comes with a little light that you can shine on a few things in the package and hidden symbols appear.I thought it was a unique and fun packaging and it went beyond my expectations.I felt the packaging for the product was great and secure. The DVDs are in booklets which are a bit awkward since they slide into the packaging instead of popping out, but they're definitely secure and are inside of the large box it comes in (as can be seen in the picture)That large brick looking thing comes in its own box, so definitely safe and secure for shipping.On the bonus disc that can be found for season 6, they have extra footage that occurs after the season finale (how much time passed after the finale is the question though) in which Ben pops up predominantly but Hurley will be there also to make an offer to someone :)"
5,Love the Series,"I love the series. This is the first English Serial watched by my sisters. Usually they dont see long serials. They love it once they saw the first disc of the season 1. they are not leaving from their seat :). Everyone loves this serial. I saw lot of negative reviews on packaging of the discs. It depends on the person how they keep the discs. As long as you keep it careful, it is not a concern. The packing and contents in the package are quite different. Finally we found the Hidden disc we take over 10 minutes to find the disc. Unfortunately we didnt have time to watch the hidden disc. We believe it has the Bonus Features."
3,This is not your average DVD Player :(,"I purchased two of these units over the holidays for my children, ages 12 & 14 both of whom wanted dvd players.Upon opening the unit, I was amazed to discover the SMALL 3.5 screen. Most of the other players have 7 to 9"" screens. This unit is difficult to watch, although most kids would be used to such a small screen because of the handheld game units on the market now. Another issue was the built in battery, it won't hold a charge. The instructions say to allow it to charge and discharge several times before the rechargeable battery has a chance to memorize the charge. But, I have other electronic equipment with similar batteries and they hold up much longer.Finally, this is a stand alone unit. The only output on the deck is for headphones. There are no video outputs or inputs as on other machines. I'm disappointed and plan on returning both of these units and purchasing a higher quality unit, such as the Toshiba (279.00) or the Poloroid (139.00)."
4,Good Product,"Pros: Very nice looking scale. I like the way you get all the different read outs. Very easy to use and set up.Cons: Some of the read outs changed for the worst over the course of a day, first the reads were good than the next day they were bad kind of confusing , but I'm still getting the hang of it."
2,Red eye,"After reading the reviews I really thought this product would be my new favorite. Wrong. I will say that it does do a good job as far as cleaning which is something I have an issue with; for some reason I get build up on my lenses quickly, making them become uncomfortable fast and vision blurry. But after using these products for about 6 weeks I began having problems with bloodshot/red eyes that got increasingly worse; I stopped using this when my eyes were so red I looked like I was getting pink eye. I may be allergic or developed an allergy to an ingredient in this system since it seems to work well for others but I would not recommend it to anyone."
5,"Attention Grabbing Fun, and OH SO CUTE!","My kids LOVE this DVD. Ok, it's not a movie per se. It's not a story, but it does have little chapters that are each fun and different. We like to play it on mute sometimes just to see the kittens running around while we do other things in the room. It's just adorable. No other DVD I can find shows kittens being kittens. My kids love kittens but I'm allergic to cats, so this is our happy medium!"
3,Poorly Designed Velcro Overlap Area,"While these slides look and feel solidly constructed, they have a design flaw that will affect some individuals. Specifically, the overlapping Velcro area is far too small - especially if you have wide feet and/or like to wear them with thick socks. Basically, I find them unusable when I want to wear them with socks and barely usable without socks. The half of the locking surface that is still adhering slowly detaches, constantly making the characteristic Velcro tearing sound with each step. If you have medium to narrow feet and don't wear these with socks, you shouldn't have any problems though.Putting the strength of the Velcro flap aside, these slides have very nice padding and are otherwise extremely comfortable. They appear to be rather durable, but I haven't worn them often due to the problems with the Velcro becoming undone."
1,In Awe of Thy Word: Understanding the King James Bible Its Mystery and History Letter by Letter (Purchased on 02/12/2008),The book still have not arrived. Perhaps it is lost in the mail.Rick Stafford501-255-6739
3,Typos galore!,"As a Woonsocket native living away for almost 30 years, I enjoyed the book because it brought back memories of the WHS-MSC rivalries of the 60's, and of playing hockey on the rinks at Cass Park growing up.I found the constant degradation of the City of Woonsocket as pretty crass.I was extremely dissapointed with the number of typos contained in the book. Numerous words stuck in sentences where they did not belong, misspelled words, words used in improper context, etc. They became a distraction in reading the book."
3,not the best dvd copy,"movie aside, the dvd hardly has any special features. the picture quality isn't very good too. i'm not aware of any other copy of the dvd though."
3,Not a good replacement for those replacing the Expert Mouse Trackball,"Price is very reasonable for a trackball however, the ball is small and does not provide the comfort or stability of the more expensive trackball units. I regret my decision to purchase the low end version when replacing my Kensington Expert Mouse."
1,Item has not shipped after 7 weeks!,"Even though the site said ""Usually Ships in 1-2 Business Days"", the item has not shipped after 7 weeks! No one in the customer service department can explain why. This company is obviously having some big problems!"
5,A accurate for a small price.,"This is my second one of the same model. Great performance, so easy, and accurate, and clicks easy - not typiclal of the less expensive ones. Can't be beat. A real work horse!"
4,A great addition for a notebook computer.,"The only negative thing about it is that there is no clamp inside the trackball to prevent the ball from falling out if the device is turned upside down or sideways. Otherwise, I merely plug it into the USB port on my laptop and it serves as a wonderful addition for my academic studies, and occasionally, games. I highly recommend it."
4,Nearly perfect,"I like this mouse, but it lacks the scroll wheel. I will be getting a mouse with a scroll wheel and keeping this one. For those who don't want a scroll wheel but do want a trackball style mouse, this one is quite possibly the best available."
2,"Comfortable, yet flimsy","This is easily the most comfortable trackball I've ever tried. It's accurate enough for most graphics work, but too delicate for gaming.However, they last for about 2 years before the left button breaks. It just wears out and can't be repaired. I'm on my third one.If you're okay with that, go ahead and buy one. Heck, buy several because you will go through them at a rate of 4-5 a decade."
2,LOUSY QUALITY as opposed to logitech,"people at apple store suggested i get a kensington, upwards of over $100, I figured this would be a great value. Unlike the other major brand, its quality matches the price.there seems to be missing one of the small ""ball bearing"" sensors moving the ball, and it is difficult to clean as opposed to experience.performance matches quality"
1,I liked it while it lasted...,"I really liked this trackball mouse when it worked, but it's not engineered to last. The track ball moves over 3 tiny white balls to help it glide over the laser, but the tiny white balls are not held in very well. I had my mouse for less than 6 months when I noticed that the ball felt like it was dragging. I pulled the track ball off to clean it when I noticed one of those tiny balls was missing. Without one of those balls the mouse had become difficult to use, feeling like it was made of lead rather than plastic, so I have thrown it out. This is the only Kensington product I have used, and I will not be trying another. It seems obvious to me that they don't care about build quailty or they would never have produced this mouse."
2,Very Disappointed,"I did not realize that it doesn't have a scroll function or a back button. Or at least I have not figured out how to scroll. It took a little getting used to after years of moving a mouse around, but the finial disappointment was when it quit working and then I remembered many years ago before I had a laser mouse that dirt would couse the ball to not work. That was the last straw and I pulled it out and went back to a laser type."
2,Not recommended,"While this mouse is very comfortable to use, it does not track properly. Another reviewer mentioned how the ball has the shinny design except for one part. Well they were right, this is a problem. The mouse will not move correctly when it is in this blank area. It is an otherwise decent mouse. I am going to buy the cheapo logtech one again. Although that one didn't last long, at least it worked properly while it lasted."
2,Not for my nails.,"After reading many reviews I stocked up on this product. Should have just bought one. I have dry, brittle nails that peel and I thought with daily use this would improve. It is actually so moisturizing it made my nails very soft and prone to bending and breaking. This may work for some others but it didn't work for me.On the other hand, my cuticles were very well conditioned. I will use the rest of the bottles i bought on my elbows, knees and feet as a nice-moisturizer. As a moisturizer and cuticle softener, 5 stars. But if you want to strengthen nails specifically, it might not meet your needs."
3,Don't know if I'll buy again,"I bought this and the smaller size. The small one is great for my purse. I have terrible cuticles. They split and tear easily. I expected too much. You really need to be diligent using it. But if you're diligent enough to massage cream on your cuticles every day, then any cream would probably work."
1,Great movies but don't order through Supermart,"Scream Triple Pack (Scream | Scream 2 | Scream 3)I love all of these movies, but I ordered from a place called Supermart. Two weeks went buy and I finally received the package, it wasn't even close to what I ordered. Contacted them and they said there was a problem and the correct order was sent out and should be here soon. Two more weeks and I contacted them again stating that they needed to overnight the movies to me, or give me a full refund including my S/H. They haven't contacted me back, and a month of dealing with these people I have no refund or movies. I help off on giving them feedback in order to give them the benifit of the doubt but after a month of no results I had to file and claim and leave negative feedback. So buy the movies, they are all great, just say away from Supermart."
1,Alex DeLarge had it easy compared to viddying this,"Watch it and try not to retch. I couldn't. It's not about ballet, or even pre-ballet, it's about Anita La Grassa feeling good about herself, and undeservedly so. The segue where she praises herself through the use of a rabbit puppet pretty much speaks for itself. The children are there throughout, though primarily as foils whose collective clumsiness serves to emphasize the perfection that is Miss Anita. If a gateway to hell were to open for just a few seconds, this would make my short list of things to cast back from whence it came.Naturally, my toddler loved this video, and she still makes reference to the tutu-clad rabbit a month after we sent this video back. Let that be a lesson to all: you can try to return it, but it will always haunt you!"
2,meh,"The first night was perfect, after that it gradually became a useless pancake. I would find something else to use."
5,NECK PAIN RELIEF,I RECOMMEND THIS NECK ROLL TO ANYONE WITH NECK PROBLEMS. IT HOLDS YOUR NECK IN THE PROPER POSITION SO YOU DO NOT AWAKEN WITH A STIFF NECK. THE FIRST ONE I GOT WAS FROM MY PHYSICAL THERAPIST...
4,Great,It's perfect. Relieves pressure on neck while lying down. I gave it one star less because the price went up by more than 20% recently. I appreciate the free shipping.
4,Helpful,I use this for help in maintaining straighter posture. I am in a wheelchair full time and this pillow reminds me to sit up. I have placed it in a verticle position under the cover of my seat back along my spine. It is very comfortable.
3,Documentation horrible,This is a good phone but the documentation is horrible. It does not even list the extra items that come with the phone and what they do or how to use them. I am sure their are dozens if not hundreds of things i could do with this phone but I can not learn from the poor instruction booklet.It takes an extremly long time for the shutte on the camera to snap after you push down and hold the button. It seems like 5 seconds. By then you or the subject may have moved.
1,Amazing GPS lets you pinpoint where your battery died,"This is the ultimate show-off gadget, as it has all features anyone could dream of, yet fail to deliver when being turned on.The battery lasts four hours when used on a typical day at the office. Using any of the other features besides calling, sms and calendar drains the battery way too fast.I had to return the phone, as I work longer days than 4 hours - and need a phone who can keep up."
5,perfect little computer,this is the best mobile phone ever made.everything is usefull and there is no another need to takevideo is most perfect part of this productand also symbian software is the fastest evernegative is only : battery...there will be a nokia bl6f battery for nokia n95 8 gb and this new battery will probably be a solution for battery problemand all parts are well madeit is really little and not heavy
3,The Runaways,Was a little slow starting out .. But gave a decent insight on how some of the first women in rock and roll struggled with prejudice.
2,"Disappointedly, Not Good","I missed the The Runaways movie in the theatre last spring when it opened because it came and went in one weekend (now I know why). But I like Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning as actresses so I figured it was worth buying. But i was greatly disappointed in that the story was poorly written and directed, and just was not interesting, and I never felt for the characters as people.There seemed to be gaps in the story, and it was never clear why Joan Jet and Cherie Currie split up, and what happen to Cherie Currie in the years that followed.But then, I never thought they had any real talent when they were performing back in the day, and the movie helped support this. This was a movie that did not need to be made.If you think you have to see it, don't buy it, just rent it at the Supermarket for $1."
3,RUNAWAYS? UNRECOGNIZABLE!,"Viewers expecting an in-depth biopic will be disappointed. I was looking forward to this movie. While it captures the era it tells a story. A story about what? The Runaways is a formula-based fictionalized retrospective piece that tells an interesting story but does so in a wholly uninteresting light; sure the film looks good and the acting is superb, but there's very little spirit or feeling to the picture and seemingly no real purpose behind the telling of the story. The Runaways seems like a movie that's been made for the sake of making a movie, the filmmakers having taken a perfectly fine story but doing nothing of substance with it. The result is a watchable but ultimately hollow movie that's of the old ""see it and forget it"" variety, it's the performances of Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning that save The Runaways from disappearing into complete obscurity. But at the very least it'll probably sell a few music downloads on iTunes."
1,Rolling Over in Her Grave,Joan Jett would be rolling over in her grave if she were dead. This is not art. It is just a tired hack job of old themes. Vampire girl has absolutely zero stage presence. Dakota Fanning can't carry this lifeless film either. I liked Kristen Stewart better in her Porsche ad. This is one of the few films that I stopped watching half way through.
4,interesting movie,I got this movie as a Kristen Stewart fan. It was very interesting to see how the Runaways got started.
1,Don't get sucked into this,"I've owned mine for 2 months and all of that time has been spent driving around with it in my car trying to get it fixed or exchanged since it hasn't work since day one. Some Dream System. The 'authorized' repair center is a total joke as well. After being at the repair center for 6 weeks, i get a call saying they can not fixed the system and that I need to send it back to Sony in texas. I get to pay for the boxes, packaging material and the shipping yeah!!!! And i haven't even watched a movie yet"
5,Classic Calvin and Hobbes,What more can you say? Yet another great collection of C&H comics. I got this for my 8-year old daughter who became a fan after reading one of my hardback collections.
5,Review of: There's Treasure Everywhere by Bill Watterson,HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!!!! (gasp) It's FUNNY!!! HA HA HA HA HA HA HA !!!!!!...
1,Really ugly,"I got this case for my Z20 camera. It is a little too big for my camera, and doesn't hold it well. Also, this case is HIDEOUS-- I was really disappointed when I saw it. The same night, my friends came over to visit and saw this case lying on the table. They too exclaimed over how unattractive it was, so it isn't just me being picky."
5,So cute!,"My favorite color, orange...hooks on to my belt loop or purse...and is sturdy to protect my camera...what's not to like?"
1,movie sucks,"This movie has no story, so if you were expecting a kick ass movie sorry. Just very slow and no script."
1,This game is worthless!,"First off, who thought up the marketing idea that continually interspersing scenes from the LOTR movies would be a great selling point? The scenes have nothing to do really with the game and it gets annoying after awhile. Second, I got totally frustrated at how I'd finish a battle then move on and then if I wanted to backtrack I'd have to fight the SAME BATTLE all over again - it can't be avoided! Other games, if you defeat and win in a battle it's done. You can go back over that same area and not have to fight the exact same battle over and over and over again. You can't choose the character you want to be which sucks and there's not really many treasures to find and they are mostly lame anyway. As a fan of LOTR, I found this game boring, frustrating and totally lacking in creativity. Don't waste your money."
1,Where's the fun?,"I had not played any LOR games and was disappointed with this one. I only played for about 30 minutes and found that I was forced to just follow the pre-determined path set by the developers. The game is really just 109 video clips from the movie, with a non-interesting path for you to follow to ""unlock them"". Someone called this Japanese RPG, I call it ""10 year old RPG"". If you are under 14 you'll love it. I would have given it 1 star, but I felt that the video clips were sort of fun. However, the Video clips don't even match the story! I wish I could return this game......"
3,Rabid LotR fans beware!,"All that about the over-linear game play and reasonably dull battle seems to have been said many times. It's very true. But I have other problems with this game.If you're a Tolkien geek you may find yourself rolling your eyes a lot, or kneeding your eyebrows in frustration. Among other discrepencies, you don't really get to see a whole lot of Middle Earth, the characters are less than stimulating, and words are CONSTANTLY mispronounced.So if you're looking to add this to your collection of LotR stuff and things I say go for it, (You're going to regardless of what I say, right?) but be prepared."
1,could have done alot better,Let me start this review off by saying i have alot of respect for Missy Elliott and like most of her fans i went out to buy her album. When i got home I put the disc into my cd player. I started listening to the music and realised it wasn't as good as her other albums. There is only one good song on this album and its pass that dutch. That song has a cool beat and rythm all the others suck. Missy you could have done alot better!
3,"Not as good as ""Under Construction...""","but even that album is alright. I really like the hook on ""Dat's What I'm Talkin' About"" as well as the songs ""Let It Bump (until Timbaland raps),"" ""Wake Up,"" ""Pump It Up (until Nelly raps)"" and ""Toyz,"" another misspelled song title that most reviewers forgot when they saw ""Dat's..."" Speaking of ""Dat's..."" I love the little parodies of R. Kelly songs, such as ""I Believe I Can Fly"" and ""The Greatest"" (from TP2.com). I like the experimental elements of the album, such as the Ragtime interlude(and these elements work well in the latter part of the album as opposed to the first few tracks), but the album is not as enjoyable and experimental as The Love Below. It seems like Missy wants to attract the video-drooling teenagers of 106 and Park (on BET) and TRL as well as people fed up with the above-mentioned teenagers, and it works, but not at a very successful level."
2,Sorry Missy,"Sorry Missy, you missed this shot. Next album, hit the target.Top Songs: Wake Up, Hot, Pass The DutchBottom Songs: The rest"
4,I really like this album.,"This album is very hilarious and fun to dance to. Missy is so gifted. I really think she could be a comedian if she wasn't an EMCEE. Her singing isn't bad either. I was really impressed with this album. I didn't give it five stars because I can skip several songs on this CD, but otherwise I was very impressed. Her standout songs are Pass That Dutch, I'm Really Hot, Dats What I'm Talkin' About, Toyz, Don't Be Cruel, and Let it Bump. If the CD wasn't filled with moaning I'd give it 5 stars."
3,Not A Hit,"This album is strictly bought if you just want to have all her albums. I was shocked to see Missy fall off like she did. I don't too much like this album. It's ok, but nothing like Under Construction or Supa Dupa Fly. The beats are not as hot nor the lyrics. She needs to come back to revamp her image. Missy is known for making hot stuff, but I was not impressed with this one at all."
2,if it was she'd get an f,I'm sick of missy and all these other stupid rappers out here leave the old school rap to some artists who really know where rap came from screw you missy no wonder timbalAND'S thinking about retiring.
2,SHE SHOULD HAVE TESTED THIS ONE FIRST,This CD is Trash a waste of time. The only reason I gave it 2* is because the first 2 singles are hot.That is it. Not to get it twisted I love Missy but she can do better that THIS IS NOT A TEST
5,"""Push It....Push it Real Good""","(...). No matter what she does, it always seems to turn out amazing, and that is definitely the case with this album. Pass that dutch, Don't Be Cruel, I'm Really Hot, Toyz, Pump it Up, and It's Real are all some of my favorite tracks, and the interludes on this album almost make it worth buying the album simply to hear them. The Toyz Interlude is hilarious!Missy continues to put out amazing records, and I hope she doesn't stop anytime soon."
5,My mom is happy,I bought this for my mom (72 years old) who sufferes knee pain going up and down the staircase. She tried a few different brand in the past but she is most happy with Schiff glucosamine plus MSM for these tablets relieved her from pain.
3,"Deceptive labeling, large tablets","I don't know how well the tablets work because I'm taking it for preventative reasons. However, as a previous poster mentioned, each tablet is not 1500 mg, one dose is (2 tablets), so the bottle effectively has 100 doses of 1500 mg each. Another downside is that the tablets are fairly large (almost an inch long)."
4,Static-X - Shadow Zone,"I would like to say that the song, ""SO"" is a great song and i dont understand why people dont like it. I love the singing on it and the keyboard and whatever it is at the beginning and end is amzing.I dont really care much about Static-X so im not gonna waste much time on this thing..good songs..-Control It-New Pain-The Only-Otsegoletric-Kill Your Idols-All In Wait-So"
1,YAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!,"This new release from Korn,no I mean Limp Noodle-wait sorry Staind? Oh yeah Static something or another. Attention all ADD kids! Rush right out and waste 15 bucks on this unoriginal formulaic BOLOGNA!!!! POO POO! hey isnt nu-metal dead yet? Get Children of Bodom or Chimaera or Megadeth or Opeth or even Machine Head and use this disc for a frisbee. Im still pissed I actually bought it."
5,Static-Xcellence!!!!,"Amazing CD. I've listened to it like 5 times. But I mainly wanna talk about the DVD. It was exactly what I wanted when I bought this. Tons of concert footage, and video of the band with their hair down, literally with Wayne in some cases. I'm a big fan of Tripp Rex Eisen, and was glad to see in the DVD he wrote alot of the lyrics for Shadow Zone. Get this CD/DVD combo now! You get a fantastic CD and a DVD of Static-X in concert, making Shadow Zone and just goofing off. 5 Stars!!!!"
1,Yawn,i'm sorry... feel asleep listening to this cd....what the hell happened to the band?OHHHH - They decided ot try and make money instead of being creative?
1,Just Bad,"There is really nothing good about this CD. In fact, when i put it in my CD player I had to look at the cover to make sure that I had not accidently bought the wrong CD. While Static X is known for their repetative riffs, this CD has extremely generic repeats. It just doesn't seem to have any energy or the intensity that made Static X good. Not to mention that Wayne Static seemed to try a new vocal style that sounds something like Jon Davis (Korn) run through a vocal effects processor. While I wouldnt go as far as to call it generic NuMetal, it comes VERY VERY close. Buy this CD if you like that kind of thing but personally, I would save your money. Buy Wisconsin Death Trip or Machine if you dont have them already."
5,Static X... All the Way!!!,Static X... one of favourite bands. Ever since I heard this album I've been listening to it almost everyday. Static X - Shadow Zone deserves 5 / 5 stars...My Song Rating:1. Destroy All - 4/52. Control It - 5/5 - Nice Intro3. New Pain - 4/54. Shadow Zone - 5/5 - Love This Song5. Dead World - 5/56. Monster - 5/57. The Only - 6/5 - Damn.. I love this Song8. Kill Your Idols - 6/5 - Nice Song9. All In Wait - 10/5 - My Favourite Song on this cd..Love it!!!10. Otsegolectric - 5/5 - Good Song11. So - 5/5 - Good Song..Kinda soft12. Transmission - 4/5 - Nice Music..No Lyrics in this song13. Invincible - 5/5 - Good Ending SongOverall I loved this Album...Like I said I listen to it alomost everyday!!!
5,F***in' A!!!,"Static-X are back and better than ever. Despite what I foresaw to be looming disaster, the guitar contributions of former Dope/Murderdolls hired gun Tripp Eisen actually added a new dimension of depth previously undiscovered in the Static-X catalogue. From the crushing introduction track ""Destroy All"" to the galloping electronic crunch of ""Otsegolectric"" to the catchy, MTV2-ready groove of ""The Only"", Shadow Zone is a winner all the way. If you're a Static fan, you'll definitely want to buy this. However, the DVD is worthless... and since there are no extra tracks on the limited edition release, you'd do just as well buying the regular version of the c.d. In any case, go out and get it... this one'll have you rockin' the X for months to come."
3,I guess it was alright,"Now let me start off by saying I LOVE Static-X, but I know this is not the best they can do. It's a pretty good album...till at least the 5th song. Then it all starts to sound the same. Another weird thing is that a couple of the songs sound like Korn. Meaning the singing and the music itself. Still, not a bad album, but the first two were MUCH heaver and in your face."
3,Definately Worth Buying,"Shadow Zone is overall an improvement from the band's last offering, Machine. The songs on Shadow Zone are consistently better, most of which have a good fast paced tempo with great energy. Only complaint with this CD is Wayne Static's attempt to sing like Jonathon Davis. It's very obvious and occasionally annoying. But the great hooks and pulsating rhythms make up for the occassional bad singing and overall makes Shadow Zone a solid CD. Standout tracks include ""Destroy All"", ""Control It"", ""Kill Your Idols"", ""All in Wait"", ""Otsegoletric"", & ""So"". ""Kill Your Idols"" is particularly very good. So if your looking for a hard hitting CD with a techno-metal flavor, pick up Shadow Zone."
1,bad stuff,"Static-X has changed a lot from their cd releases like ""Wisconsin Death Trip"" that's a must have of Static-X but making this kind of music now this guys expect them to do a song with Britney Spears or Jack White of Thy White Stripes in their next album"
2,"Static-X's third offering is as mediocre as ""Machine""","""Machine"", the previous album from Static-X, was pretty mediocre and a serious letdown after their surprising 1999 debut ""Wisconsin Death Trip"". ""Shadow Zone"", the third offering from Static-X, is as medicore as ""Machine"", and as sad as it is to say, finds Wayne Static and co. sounding like a derivative Ministry cover band. Former Dope guitarist Tripp Eisen, who is having some troubles of his own at the moment, isn't a good fit and pales in comparison to Koichi, but Wayne Static's songwriting seems to have taken a nosedive here. ""Dead World"", ""So"", and ""Invincible"" are incredibly lame, while ""Control It"" and ""Kill Your Idols"" are solid post-industrial sludge. Other than that, ""Shadow Zone"" really doesn't offer anything that you haven't heard before, which is a big disappointment because Static-X was one of the few bands to emerge from the late 90's nu-metal kick that actually deserved attention. Stick with ""Wisconsin Death Trip""."
3,10 minute break.,My son will play with this toy for about ten minutes then move on to something else. It is very durable. He has dropped this toy from his highchair many times and it still works.
1,Disappointed,"I'm surprised this toy got so many positive reviews. The speaking voice that comes out drives me crazy! The inflections of individual words don't match the sentence; for example, the voice says, ""This is the RED triangle"" and the word ""red"" has this excited, overly happy inflection. It just doesn't fit in the sentence. It's the same with most of the sentences and sounds unnatural - ""Let's call MOMMY!"" It reminds me of a computer voice where the words are pieced together. We have other Vtech toys that we are very happy with. I wish we had a different brand of toy phone, though!"
2,Vtech dial and discover,"The toy is quite nice and temporarily keeps my duaghter away from my phone, but is not really loud enough.It should two volume levels, or at least the ability to ring loudly like a normal phone.Some more work will need to done on this product."
1,Very Low Volume,"This Vtech phone has very low volume. Overall, it seemed to be a nice toy with the flashing buttons and design (very eye catching), but with the very low volume it couldn't attract my 9 months old daughter attention. She would pick it up, look at it a bit, then throw it aside."
3,Corbu alive,"Haven't read this one but I have in my Corb collection Dominique Lyon's 'Le Corbusier Alive'(VILO International, Paris, 2000: ISBN: 2-84576-007-8) which recounts and rephotographs most of Corb's most famous work on 4 continents. Contained therein is the most literate and plainly written critique of his La Tourette design intentions that I have read. This chapter is a gem and will bring you closer to an understanding of what he sought to achieve in his building.There is also a delightful chapter on Mr and Mrs Corbu's weekender in the south of France."
1,Nano case,"This case was made for the old nano and I have the new one, so I will give it away to someone who can use it. I was not happy at all in the size but it is cute."
3,Better than it first seems.,"Kathi Appelt, Poems from Homeroom: A Writer's Place to Start (Henry Holt, 2002)I'm still not quite sure how I feel about this book. I love the second section of it, where Appelt goes into the ideas behind the poems and provides exercises for young readers to get to writing (even if she does make the usual mistake of calling 5-7-5 an established form, rather than a guideline, in English haiku). As for the poems themselves, the jury's still kind of out. Attention is paid to the crafting of them, which in itself makes them rise to above average in today's world of published poetry; if there is a problem, it's that the narrative structure of much of the poetry tends to get away from the image, and so some of it sounds like prose broken up into lines rather than poetry. Appelt is very good at using form, though, and when she does this collection shines.Overall, there's more good than bad here. Worth checking out. ***"
1,Dwight Yoakam Live Video,I LOVE Dwight Yoakam and was so excited there was a video available of him and his songs. I was so disappointed when I watched this video!! It was poor video and sound quality. It appeared to be shot with a home video and they had poor lighting. In my opinion it was a waste of money.
3,"Nice chronicle of the events of Mussolini's life, but ...","This biography is a comprehensive chronicle of Mussolini's life but does not include deeper, coherent psychological analysis of Mussolini or a political analysis of how he came to power. Because I was looking for those analyses, I was disappointed."
2,NIRVANA SMELLS LIKE CRAP,I love Nirvana one of my favorite bands. But when I got this for christmas uhhhhhhh the box...stank. The quality of the music stank. The DVD had only one music video and it wasnt the most famous one (Smells like teen spirit). Most of the DVD was just home footage and it gets really boring after a while. If you want a real box set go out and buy all of there albums. Dont waste your money on this. The box set scores points for its cool booklet inside and if you put your fingers on the back of the dark set it will do this cool trick where it well turn white where you can see everything so it kind of tyes in with th name with th lighs out.Nirvana ROCKSSS but this bow set SUCKS!!!
5,AHhh,"Ok...number 1: i'm over 13Ok...number 2: i wish you didn't have to make an account.Anyway, this is only for pure Nirvana-lovers. The songs are recorded with low quality, that only hard core fans would appreciate. If you're one of those people who only likes they're hits and such, dont buy it, buy Nevermind, or Nirvana.These cds are basically the side of Cobain that you don't see. Buy it if you'd like to see it. Most of the cd is Kurt's demos and such, but i think it's nice to hear the artist in the process, but if you don't think it's necessary to hear it, then just don't buy it. if you're curious, borrow a friends copy and listen to some of it, i reccomend listening to the 2nd and 3rd disk in this..and definitely give 'you know you're right' a listen. I'm dissapointed in the dvd though. but what can you do? kurt's dead.Why is 'beans' on this?"
5,The Box Sets Of All Box Sets,OMG...I know when I first ordered this item I was a bit concerned that it would be your typical (Kiss type) box set. A bunch of previously released material that's been doctored up to sound different. Boy was I mistaken. The DVD alone is worth about $40 with the rare material found there. And the music throughout is well placed. No dull moments on this set. If you're a fan you have to have this!!!
3,Okay? And?,"I don't see why everyone is in Nirvana's ass so much. They started a whole new movement and I respect them for what they did...but their music isn't f*king spectacular or the best music Ive ever heard in my life. I guess if I was the age I am now in the early 90's then I would've understood better. But with where music is going today, it is important that we look back on Nirvana and realize where it has been. If they were still around today, I think they wouldn't be as good. But they were good for their time. With spontaneous and depressing lyrics...why were people so surprised that Kurt killed himself? Did you really think he sung songs like that for fun? Good band for their time but not a good band for today. I will always respect Nirvana and listen to them from time to time. I am in no way dissing this legendary band. This box set is just for die hard lifetime fans only."
4,My Michael,Amos Oz is one of the great narrative story tellers of any century and this early novel is no exception. this book does require the reader to pay attention and be alert.
2,Needs good editing,"This is a good first draft of a mystery novel, with some good characterizations and plot and use of suspense, but it's just not a final product.The book is too drawn-out, and the author repeatedly hits us with the same descriptions as if the reader isn't bright enough to ""get it"" the first two times a scene or concept is described -- such as the drug king-pin's desk with the built-in phone, and why this squad is called the ""100% squad.""The plot device of the young neighborhood kid, ""Salsa,"" being simultaneously accepted into the inner circle of the drug king-pin, at the same time ""Salsa"" is virtually the foster son of a detective, and torn between the two worlds, is not credible. The use of untranslated Spanish dialogue would be frustrating to a reader who doesn't speak Spanish.Author E.W. Count's later book, ""Cop Talk,"" is a much-better factual recitation of NYPD detectives' lives and work."
3,"So, so...","It's nice, but not so magnificient as their last album... This is for Libera fans (like me) that won't miss a thing about them, even if some songs are re-arranged, repeated or remixed or whatever that means the same. The boys are awesome, as always, but this lacks something... Don't know quite good what it is (I've been playing the dics lately to get a hold on it, and couldn't by some reason)... Anyway, a good buy for rookies ;-)"
3,Politics in Boston,"A new book is one you haven't read. Harry Kemelman's ""Someday the Rabbi Will Leave,"" is a fine addition to a fun series. Rabbi David Small, always serves the synagogue at the pleasure of the members, hence his wife keeps her bags half-packed against the day when principals will conflict with desires.Not even a healthy raise will influence Rabbi Small to perform a mixed marriage. When a neighbor is accused of a hit-and-run fatality, Rabbi Small suspects a trap, but follows his edicts to untangle another mystery. A good light read for the cozy fan who had not discovered this fine older author.Nash Black, author of ""Qualifying Laps"" and ""Sins of the Fathers."""
3,Wonderful and clear,"Tony is up there with Byron Katie, Jeff Foster, John Wheeler, etc, in terms of expressing this nondual realisation, although of course they all do it in different ways. Yes this book lives up to the hype. It is a wonderful clear expression of nonduality. But sometimes I wonder with Tony- I dont know, he doesnt emphasise the compassion and love that some other teachers talk about. Sometimes he sounds quite harsh, in a way. Personally I prefer teachers such as Jeff Foster and Byron Katie who resonate with me in terms of expressing the ""compassion"" that the nondual realisating brings.... which to me seems the hallmark of ""awakening"". But what do I know!!!!"
3,Think For Yourself,"Who is Tony Parsons and why is his defintion of enlightenment ""it""? Books about enlightenment and awakening need to be taken with a huge grain of salt and this one is no exception. There is a difference between accepting what ""is"", and accepting what ""is"", and then trying to manifest change. Trying to create a ""better"" world is not denying what the world ""is"". It is using our human ability to create. While I don't agree with books giving you rules and exerscizes to attain enlightenment, Tony is at the other end of the spectrum saying there is no need to do anything because everything just ""is"". Everything ""is"" up to you. Manifest YOUR own enlightenment to whatever degree YOU think is appropriate. Not Tony's."
3,Lacking something....,"This is one of a few Tony Parsons books I have read - I am trying to make a point of only reviewing those books that touch a nerve with me in one way or another. This book is one of Tony's simplest, I feel. It contains words that attempt to point to Presence, to a life beyond the personal self. It contains some beautiful statements, such as ""You are not your thoughts, your mind, your body; or any other object, but that behind all of these is a still, constant seeming nothingness from which everything emanates: this is what you are."" In so many ways his words remind me of Eckhart Tolle. Yet there is something about this teaching that does not ring true. It feels like Tony is missing something, that there is a fullness beyond what he is sharing which he is not quite in touch with, or is not describing fully. The book leaves me with a sadness, a sense that Tony is onto something, but hasn't quite made the leap beyond his own ideas."
4,I am enjoying my pillow,"I ordered this pillow because recently I have had a stiff neck and shoulders and my regular heating pad wasn't doing the job. The product came a day before it was due to be delivered and it works great. My microwave heats the pillow in a minute and 50 seconds which seems to be the average time for most people. I read that it held heat for 2 hours but mine only holds the heat for 30 minutes but it feels great. It is a moist, warm heat and it soothed my muscles. Great product."
1,Horrible!!!,"It's only rice! doesn't give you any relief.buy a pound of rice heat it up and put it on your shoulders, you are goin to get the same results for .50 cents."
5,An excellent and understandable explanation of alcoholism.,"This is an inspiring book for anyone who is or knows an alcoholic. My mother-in-law is in the final stages of alcoholism. I felt like crying when I read this book because I felt like the author had met her or seen her. Just when we think there is no hope and that we are alone with this disease, we realize that others are out there, and that we can learn from their experiences. The descriptions are detailed and the personal accounts are vivid. Anyone who is an alcoholic or who knows an alcoholic should read this book."
4,AT HIS PEAKE,"McGrath has the dexterity of a surgeon when it comes to crafting supberb psychological suspense and highly unique characters. And Martha Peake is no exception, and finds McGrath at his finest. Martha Peake is a brilliantly moving, darkly disturbing, and unforgettable tale from the master of modern Gothic"
5,Concise yet authoritative,"The low ranking below must result from something personal. Sullivan is a true authority as he's taught the Crescent City's twisting, multiracial history for years at the University of New Orleans. And when Orleans Parish wanted it's cab drivers to know their own landmarks, City Hall had him put them wise. Beyond this though, it's a fine read. I used to laugh at the architectural damage the developers had done through the decade. But New Orleans has always grasped the modern and this has been its real architectural struggle. This book helps put the changes in perspective."
1,Garbage,This is a scam my printer ran out of ink in less than 2 weeks! I think this are not original and probably remanufactured.
3,OK....but can deplete fastly depending on your needs,I have bought the color and and black cartridges and they lasted roughly 4 weeks. However the images rendered were crisp and and detailed.
1,Printonic generic ink for Canon MX310,"WE bought 2 of these ink refills and after about 25 pages it is claiming we are out of ink and the machine will not print. That makes it a very expensive ""cheap alternative."""
5,Canon ink,Canon ink is the only ink I use for my Canon printer. Never had a problem. I prefer it to recycled ink cartridges.
2,Good for only about 50 copies,This cartridge runs out really quickly. But so do most inkjet cartridges. You would do well to buy multiples of this item.
5,It's ink,"If you're looking for ink for your printer, good for you, this is ink. If you aren't, I suggest going back a page.What can I say? As printer ink, it's spectacular. As a babysitter, it's lacking."
1,absolutely useless,"Bought 3. upon replacing, the printer status always shows low on ink.I trusted Amazon before not to have fake products like this on their site. Not anymore."
3,Ink is Fine but Doesn't Last Long,"I bought this ink at the beginning of the school year. I haven't hardly used it at all, but it only has about 1/3 of the ink left. My printer is a Canon MP210 which from memory was fairly cheap, but I think it may be time for a new printer with how much ink I've bought. I just bought the PG-40 ink though, so I'll write a review on it after I squeeze all I can out of the PG-30."
3,Basics of photography,"If you are looking for photography basics this is the book for you. However, if you are familiar with photography either digital or 35 mm you might want to look elsewhere.Be aware that none of the material on the CD will work on a macintosh, which is certainly disappointing."
1,regret buying,I bought this and realized that it is not working (I used it for the first time after the warranty period is due). No quality assurance before packing the items from the manufacturer.
4,BONITO,"AUN SE ESTA PROBANDO PERO ME PARECE MUY UTIL POR EL PRECIO, BUENO PARA VIAJES NO RECOMENDADO PARA EL USO EN EL HOGAR"
2,Not much punch,"It's cheap and portable, but doesn't pack much punch. I bought the Samsonite steamer to replace a portable steamer that died years ago. The old steamer produced a directed stream of visible steam that made quick work of large wrinkles. This one doesn't produce enough steam to build up any pressure, and very slowly handles only minor wrinkles. It is not any faster than using the hotel iron. It works, I guess, but I was looking for a time saver, not just portability."
4,steams a lot,Small steamer works well and get a whole lot of steam for a little amount of water. Only problem is that I cannot seem to completely empty the water....might be a problem getting thru security at the airport which was the reason for purchase!
1,Poor quality,"First one had a pin hole in one of the seams. The seller did quickly replace it ! However, the replacement unit arrived with the hose threads in effect already stripped out. It does look more like a manufacturing defect than damage, but I am 0 for 2. Time to buy a different product!"
5,Incredible !! A must read!!,"Trust me, my nose will not grow by telling you that this book is an absolute must read.Mark Phillips ingenious concept of combining America's favorite tales, with a vocabulary building premise is back. This time for the intermediate vocabulary level with the story of Pinocchio.Everyone knows and loves the story of Pinocchio. As a result, when reading this book, you do not feel like you are doing any work to learn new words. It's like studying without the tediousness of study. You will be amazed how words seemlessly enter your everyday usage. Also, after you have read Mark Phillips' books, you will notice when reading other things you suddenly have a new level of comprehension thanks to a vaster vocabulary breadth.Do yourself a favor and buy one of these for yourself and every child in your family today. You will find them incredibly enjoyable, and will learn to master words that will serve you for the rest of your lives."
1,This was a major disappointment,"Too bad I can't give this one no stars. This disk is really bad. The performance is by a bland synthesizer ""orchestra"" without any of the depth or emotion you can find on the movie soundtracks. I would sell this CD back to the music store where I bought it, but then somebody else might be tempted to buy it. No; this disk is headed for the trash bin."
5,A fun book for any age,I loved this book when I was a kid and although its out of print its worth the search! A delightful modern classic for the young at heart!
4,Nice guitars...,"Very nice guitar work; sort of reminiscent of Guadalcanal Diary or Love Tractor, if you're *old* enough to remember them...If you like this, check out ""The Dumbest Magnets"" by Dolly Varden."
3,Charger,Came on time but I have not had a chance to use it so I don't have an opinion. No opinion YET!
2,great buy,I am happy with my purchase .It is very useful with my Mobil automotive business and i would recommend it for those Mobil mechanics
4,Good product,"As others have written, it really should have a backlight on the meter, but other than that a good product."
1,My 2nd & last Schumacher charger,"OK, so I've only owned 2 Schumacher chargers. But when you spend$70 for a charger you expect it to work at least twice, & this one didn't.One star for decent packaging."
5,Easier to use and read than the old model SE-1252MA,"I bought this model to replace an old SE-1252MA Schumacher I'd used for years. The green light letting you know the battery is charged is very helpful as is the yellow ""power on"" light. The percent charged scale is easy to read. The old model had no green light, no yellow power light and the percent charged scale was very confusing to read. Conventional and deep cycle choices are handy. The 2, 10 or 50 amp selections are also handy."
5,Very Good for pianists,I was very happy with this music book as it contained most of the beautiful songs of il divo well arranged and very good for playing
5,AWESOME!!!,"Very Satisfied, as I am am a new fan of the show, and was so happy to be able to watch the 1st episode of the Final Season here 1st before DVD release!!! :-)"
4,why dont they have half stars? i give it four and a half stars!!,"I LOVED the last season! I enjoyed more then season 5. i liked that they did the flash sideways like they did the flashbacks. and i loved that they showed a different outcome for everyone along that timeline, i never really liked the flashbacks some were irrelevant to the story. but season 6 made the most sense to me the only reason i get it a four and a half was because of the ending (really sad)"
3,Review Lost Season 6,Actually enjoyed this entire series but just like most people I thought season 6 was a bit of a let down.
3,I was just okay.,The ending was not very satisfying. I was really left bewildered by what the whole meeting in the church was about.
3,Not a satisfying ending,I expected a much better ending than this.. It seemed some fantasy in the end..And now I think all the cast is dead in that at teh end.
2,Lost....,"wow, so disappointed and what a depressing ending. If I wanted to see the dead walk into the light, I'd watch Ghost Whisperer. And I won't mention that back in year 1 the producers insisted purgatory had nothing to do with this show.the best moment of the show? Vincent laying next to Jack. I expected a few more happy moments for 2.5 hrs of TV."
2,Not the best...,"LOST Season 6 is disappointing after they had so many great seasons before it. With the way the storyline turns out in the last one to two seasons, I was almost embarassed to be a fan. I hate that the producers say that true fans would love this season and the finale, but they lost me once the time traveling started. Season 1-3 are my faves!! I own 1-5, but I dont think I am even going to buy this one"
1,I want all that time back,"I have to count myself among those who, in the final 15 minutes of the final episode, felt like I had been royally conned. Essentially, you can watch the first season and the last episode or two and get as much out of it as watching the entire series. Yes, there were some exciting, intriguing aspects to the show, but to find out that they were ultimately just filler with no real point throws a bucket of water over any of the ""good"" parts. It's not the lack of ultimate answers, it's the lack of any resolution to the stories. People who go on about the characters seem to forget that the characters are pretty stock and only developed through the mysteries and action on the show. Otherwise, they were pretty bland."
4,As good as I remembered from initial viewing.,"As good as I remembered from initial viewing. Although the ending didn't answer all questions, I thought it did a creditable job."
4,Not a great ending to a good series,This show was one of the best on tv for 6 years. All the twists and turns and all the questions you wanted answered was not solved. You had more questions than you had answers. It was really a weak ending. A good season but it ended flat. This svd is good to have if you loved the show and want the end to the collection. It could have been so much better.
1,Swindle at the end,"This is how began as a great science-fiction oriented show. Action paced, amazing acting, big budget. But, already in Season Three, it was clear (to me, at least) that the writers did not know where they were going.Also, the producers probably turned the process of casting into a big money game. That's the simple explanation for the huge quantity of characters, even new ones appearing in Season Six! (you can almost visualize the scene: an agent asking the producers: ""How much do I pay to get my client in the show?"")The producers sensed they got a steady following (rightly so, judging the so many great reviews) and thought they could get away with murder. So, why bothering explaining the ""hundreds"" of unansewred questions? We just tell them that ""what matters is the journey"".To me, the ending was a complete swindle on a faithful audience, one that stuck to the show even after the atrocious Season Three."
3,40-GM20 vs 40-GM10 Confusion,"I bought this adapter to use during an aftermarket radio install in my 2003 GMC Yukon. Based on Metra's website it looked like I could use a 40GM-20 or 40GM-10 adapter. Well it turns out the 40GM-20 does not work. This adapter is meant for aftermarket antenna coaxial cables. Also, the male end of this adapter was not long enough the fit in the Pioneer radio I was installing. The male end has a right angle connector and hit the frame of the radio before a connnection was made. The 40GM-10's coaxial male end is much longer and fit in the radio perfectly. Most GM vehicles with a stock antenna wire should use the 40GM-10.However, the quality of the adapter seemed great. I cannot speak to its function. I just wanted to write this review to hopefully clear up any confusion future buyers may have."
2,Bottle Warmer,"Save your money, I should have believed some of the other review. This warmer works, but does not put out enough heat to really warm a milk bottle in a reasonable time. Good concept, nicely assembled, but I could not recommend this to anyone else."
2,crap,Got this with lots of hope tro solve my issue with bathroom cabnet storage and the shelves in this don't even have runners much less is this unit attractive in any way -we will have to redo this because i need dwarers
5,Doesn't Suck,"I'm lazy so I got this instead of burning my NoFx cd's, yeah I'm that lazy. Anyways this is great for people that don't know too much about the band, and want a big slice of NoFX pie, it's yummy to the last riff. Melvin would want you to buy this."
5,Great book!,I'm an avid mystery reader and this book was one of the best I've read. I could not put the book down and was sad to have it end. The characters and story lines were fantastic.
1,Totally disappointed,"...this small, fragile toy is just not worht the $30. No instruction comes with the toy. Some details shown on the box are missing. It never stretches from 4"" to 6"" as the descroption in this site says (at most 5""). ..."
2,Save your money and just write!,Isn't that essentially her point? How many more self-styled Zen teachers do we need to point out the obvious?
3,"Fun, but falls apart","The wings fell off as I was taking Buzz out of the package. We tried to put them back on, but they just fell off. This toy is for my 2 year old, he really didn't care that Buzz's wings were missing. We just took them off and put them away. He still has fun with the toy."
2,Big dissapointment for Buzz,"My 3 year old son loves Toy Story 2 and Buzz Lightyear. I saw this doll and had to have it after going to the Disney store and finding that they did not have any in stock with his original uniform on. It has been quite frustrating as the toy falls apart every time you play with it. The backpack falls off if you even look at it and the wings dont stay on. I cant imagine why the wings come off anyway. And to top it off it DOES NOT say ""To infinity and Beyond"" which is the classic quote of Buzz. I would not recommend this toy as you cant play with it properly if it falls apart each time you pick it up."
5,I've taught this book in a small group and it was loved by everyone!,"As the mother of 2 and a pastor's wife, I found Martha Peace's book to be a refreshing and accurate Biblical study, not only when I read it personally, but also when I taught it to 21 women at my church. The women in the group unanimously and unequivocably agreed that the Scripture found in this book, as well as Peace's commentary of the Scripture, was life-changing and marriage building.Frankly, not everyone will like this book. We live in a world that rejects inerrancy of Scripture and that dismisses Biblical relevancy. But it has been my experience that living in a Godly marriage is the happiest thing I've ever known. I thank Mrs. Peace for having the boldness to proclaim God's Word, even though critics may scoff at or ridicule it and her.Read this book. God may change your home."
1,I had a bad feeling about this one,"I had a bad feeling about this book when I started reading it. The one star I rated it is for Mrs. Peace's testimony that seems honest and transparent and for the valid biblical principles she did present.I do agree with her that a wife should seek God with all her heart among other biblical principles (how to bring a biblical reproof, how to communicate biblically, etc), but she inserted her opinion and used snippets of scripture to back them up too often in this book.Please see the rest of the 2 and 1 star reviews. A lot of them said it all. I did not feel that the exegesis of scripture was thorough, taking into account cultural and linguistic implications of the passages she used - mostly Psalm 31, Titus 2, and others. Also, as mentioned before, she often chose just parts of scripture to support her ideas. I pray that anyone else who reads this book looks up the scripture themselves and checks what this author is writing."
1,Disc Gone Bad,I've had the same problem with the DVD going bad. This is extremely dissappointing as this is one of my favorite concert videos. If there is anyone out there who has found a solution please post here and on www.yesshoo.com
5,Exciting and Unique!,"This, the second in the Lianna's Children series, was so exciting and unique that I did not want to put it down. The characters came to life with the vivid details and descriptions of the author. I enjoyed this continuation of the series as much as I did the first. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes action, vampires and great descriptions of cities."
1,haste makes waste!,"I needed some Indonesian sweet soy sauce in a hurry, so decided to order this product. Bad idea! I should've just made some- it's quite easy (with little active time & easy to find ingredients) to make Indonesian sweet soy sauce and so much better tasting. This is going down the drain as soon as I make a batch of the good stuff!"
5,Masterpiece,"This is one a handfull of albums that changed the way I percieve music. The others are DARK SIDE OF THE MOON(Pink Floyd),REVOLVER(Beatles),PINK MOON(Nick Drake),GONE TO EARTH,SECRETS OF THE BEEHIVE(David Sylvian),LED ZEPPELIN IV,FOXTROT(Genesis),ELTON JOHN'S GREATEST HITS VOL.1,LOW(Bowie)and FRAGILE(Yes). Words can't describe to beauty and mystery to this wonderful work.And to think they started off as a synth pop band!??!"
5,This Book changed our lives. Thank you Jon Barron!,"Quite simply the best book I have ever read on health. It was easy to read, written in plain english and yet so packed with practical and eye opening information that it has changed our lives in the last year! We have reversed physical conditions we thought we had to live with by using this information. IE: Acid Reflux, Menopause, Back pain, weight loss and much more. You can see why I say it's changed our lives. Thank you for this book. I'm so glad to see it on ...!"
5,"Live Again, Naturally!","Jon's ""Lessons From The Miracle Doctors"" is the premier guide to regaining ones vitality, no matter what ails you. Recapturing your health is as easy as changing the way we view food and herbs. Food may be seen as feul for daily living, however with proper diet and supplementation, we can literally reprogram our immune systems with these powerful medicines,I discovered Jon's wonderful program and products in the early 90's and I've been a loyal customer since. He is an incredibly gifted natural healer and creator of, in my opinion, the finest herbal formulas in production. I recommend this book to all who are ready to feel great again, if you're sick and tired of being sick and tired, this is the answer."
5,Back to basics,"If he does nothing else, Barron helps us understand the factors that have given rise to the increasing health problems in the U.S. - factors that, many times, are beyond our control.Having set the stage for ""the cure,"" he then proceeds to show, step-by-step, how we can periodically cleanse and detox the body, then supplement with proper nutrients, thus paving the way for a return to optimum health.I know. I've done it. And I'm healthier for having done it. If you're concerned about whether you are powerless in dealing with all the factors that have given rise to increases in nearly every type of disease, then you need this book. You will discover that you aren't powerless at all."
2,Not for everyone,"I really wanted to like this book but found myself unable to get past Rives' cutesy approach and writing style. He has some good information to share but he's too impressed with his own wit and it wears after a while. I'm an avid walker and disagree with some of his concepts. For example, he doesn't discuss the benefits of healthy eating enough and folks are apt to think they can eat whatever they want if they walk - well, you can if you have the metabolism of a hummingbird. His chapter on other exercises is just plain silly and gives no useful information. I found many of the chapters repetitive and just got bored. Walking is a great fat-burning exercise, but you'll get more for your money with one of the excellent walking audiotapes by Kathy Smith or one of the many other exercise pros who from my reading take a more well-rounded and balanced approach than Rives."
3,"It is ok , but the sheild is small","The sheild is too small , someone could get around it easly,it shakes when you shoot. You should get a water gun with a trigger."
4,odd and funny,"What an odd little book this is. Published in 1983, Fup is the story of a cantankerous grandfather, his gentle grandson, and their pet, a 20-pound mallard duck (the grandfather named the duck because he thought Fup duck was funny). Born in 1880 the grandfather spends most of his 100 years tending his stills, sleeping, and drinking his 194-proof whiskey called Ol' Death Whisper, which he believes will keep him alive forever. The grandson is a master fence builder and spends his time building dividing their enormous Northern California ranch and hunting the giant wild boar that keeps tearing up the fences. Compared on the book jacket to Tom Robbins or Mark Twain, Dodge's style reminds me more of a Richard Brautigan. It's not quite as poetic, but is just as original, odd, and hilarious."
5,Fup Duck,"Absolutely one of the most hilarious books I've ever read. Was lucky to buy it when it first came to market and have shared its humor with a few special people. The book is at times rude, crude, poignant and heartbreaking. But, it's not for everyone."
5,Product Review,The product was as described and arrived quickly! I did return this item because I did not have the correct kennel to match the roof system which was all my fault!
5,A New twist on the taco!!,"These aren't your ordinary tacos!! I made the pork tenderloin tacos the other night and they were an instant favorite with my family. The pictures in the book are wonderful, and the recipes are easy to follow."
3,I LOVE THIS MOVIE,"But, I can't stand when people try to make themselves critics.. We all have our opinions, and even though I would recommend this movie to anyone I have to give it three stars because the sound quality when I rented it was AWFUL. We had to sit a foot away just to hear it, so annoying. Wish they could fix it before it expires!"
5,The girls loved it and so did mommy!,"As with all things Disney, my 6 year old daughter and my 5 year old niece love this movie despite the fact that they've seen it many many times. I watched with them and also enjoyed it."
4,Tangled,"It was a humorous movie, suitable for all ages. I did see some things that may ""go over the head"" of some of the younger viewers. Surprisingly, I knew very little about the original fairy tale, but I enjoyed it and would have no problem with letting my younger grandchildren watch it."
5,Excellent Animation Movie!,"When I seen the trailers for this movie it reminded me of the Disney movie ""Aladdin"" where it looked funny, adventurous, and a movie that I could escape in for a short time period. I found ""Tangled"" to be that movie! This does has songs in it, similar to a lot of other Disney movies. I think this could be watched by the entire family as a family video day or evening."
5,kids love it,this is a very cute movie for all. the kids love it and have watched it over and over again. very good buy got it cheeper than if would have went to walmart.
5,Interesting & fun,Not quite what you might expect; and that works to keep your attention. This is an excellently written and EXECUTED story!
5,Love it!,"Nothing better than a favorite movie on a portable device! Car rides, doctor's office, or as a distraction at home this rocks!"
5,The kids love it,We love watching this movie at home with our kids. It never gets old and we can't wait to watch it over and over again.
3,"Arrived on time, but disc had issues","Recieved this disc promptly and the condition seemed like new. However after playing the 3D disc, we began to experience issues with the video hanging for a few seconds every 15-20minutes. Was annoying, but we were able to finish it.Tried cleaning the disc, but didn't seem to help."
5,BEST Disney movie EVER!!!!,BEST Disney Princess movie EVER!!!! Loved it! I am 33 and have a little girl who has always been scared of the Disney princess movies because of their very evil villans. But this was the best because even though Mother Gothel is indeed evil - she is not terrifying to look at.. she is just more sneaky than outwardy wicked. The HORSE steals the show and I love what an important role the main guy plays in this movie!!
1,Great Movie...but really...31$ a pop,"I've seen the movie in 3D, I love it, it was well worth the money and effort to go see; the work is excellent, the comedy is excellent [with enough Adult Only in jokes to keep the parents amused]... BUT I am just so taken aback that this item is for sale on here at $30.95. Why? It's not even a 'new release'. No disc warrants that amount of money... no matter how many times the little ones will watch it. And I see that the bluray version is cheaper. Is this the same ploy that the music industry used to get us to switch to the infinitely more profitable CD format from vinyl? Make the newer [and more profitable in the long run] format cheaper? I know it isn't Amazon that is racking this up to insane prices [at least I hope it isn't :)]. I think people should just boycott items that are overpriced, either online or in stores. The companies will soon get the message.by the way, this item retails here in Ireland in store for Euro 9.99 which comes to about $14.00."
4,Great Product! But just a tiny thing....,"I think it is a very good product and great money value for a Blu-ray and DVD-combo pack. However, just one thing is not that good, which is the volume level of the actual film in Blu-ray disc is a bit too low, I have to raise the volume to the max on my laptop to get a relatively ok volume to enjoy the video, but actually it is still not the best volume level result."
5,One of my favorite Disney movies! Clever and beautiful!,"My husband and I both love this movie as much, if not more than our 2 1/2 yr old daughter... and she adores it! She sings along to every song and cracks up over Paskell and Maximus. The voices are nothing short of amazing and as usual, Disney is brilliant in bringing such life and personality to all characters... especially the animals who have no real dialogue outside of facial expressions and body language. Don't miss this one!"
2,Doesn't Play,"The movie itself it wonderful!! Unfortunatly,the copy I purchased doesn't play in my DVD play and acts ups in my Blu-ray."
4,TANGLED,"My granddaughter loves this movie. I have a VCR in the car and when we go somewhere, Tangled has to go with us! All she wants for Christmas is Repunzel, Eugene and Max!"
5,Great Flick,I really enjoyed this. It was a real winner. The horse was my favorite character. A very nice take on the fairy tale.
5,A real Treasurer,"I just purchased a 3D tv and wanted a movie to try out on the TV. I had heard this was a good movie and I thought the kids would enjoy it. This is now both my kids and my favorite Disney movie. Easilly the best Disney movie I have seen, great characters, great story, and very fun. The 3D was pretty spectacular too. Only in some scenes was it really noticable, but they did a good job of integrating it elsewhere too.Worth the purchase as it has been played dozens of times."
4,A very entertaining movie,Tangled is a magical and funny movie that had my attention from beginning to end. I took my niece to see it and expected to be bored but that wasn't the case at all. I just wish that the white horse Maximus had more scenes because he's just hilarious and he's a scene stealer. I think he's the most original Disney character in awhile and he didn't even need any lines to be funny.
1,Not by Choice,"Spoiler Alert--I'd like to address a key point to this movie that I haven't seen anyone mention. It has to do with how Rapunzel escapes a life of unhappiness with the woman who has been pretending to be her mother all her life...the boyfriend makes the choice for her. In one fell swoop he takes away the one thing that makes her unique and powerful, all under the guise of having done it for love. Just one of the many missteps of the movie--the fake mom is abusive; the love interest is a thief; above all else, beauty and youth must be maintained; long golden locks = power and short brown hair = not...etc. And then we wonder why our kids are nuts."
3,Cute,"It's a cute movie and I got a kick out of it, although I don't think it's one of Disney's best in this genre."
2,LOVE movie but the DVD sent by amazon was scratched/damaged,We love Tangled - it's one of our favorites. The negativity in this review is exclusive to the actual DVD that we received in our order from amazon. It was scratched and the movie skips all throughout. Very disappointed.
5,The best Disney movie EVER,"I have watched this movie over 10 times and it still hasnt gotten old. Its special because Disney put a lot of thought and comedy into the ""typical"" romance and made the characters realistic and relative. Ever 2 seconds I would think to myself, ""thats exactly how I act!"" XD It was just the most adorable movie and I will treasure it and pray that Disney continues down this path."
5,A Great Day at the Movies!,"First of all, I'd like to say that I'm 24 and have parents in their 50's. That being said, we decided to go see Tangled one day while I was home around Thanksgiving, especially since it was in our local $3 theater. We had a BLAST!!! The movie really did have something for everyone. I was very impressed with Disney about how they personified Max. I think he really helped to make the film what it is.Overall, I felt like a kid while I watched this movie. It had everything: comedy, action, romance... I felt that it was a great spin on Rapunzel, and that it was definitely ""a keeper"" when it comes to my movie collection."
5,Great movie for the price,I am so glad I ordered this through Amazon. It is a great movie and I got it for a great price. It shipped fast and we were able to have a movie night that weekend. Thanks
5,AWESOMEEEEEEE,"Oh my god,,.i took my daughter but I think I enjoyed the movie much moire than she did..adorable !!witty dialogue, great quality of picture, animation and graphics. The hours just slipped away and every time I see the poster of this movie, I want to go watch it again...Needless to say, I bought the DVd as soon as it came out..its always on, my toddler daughter loves it as much as meshe even got her granny hooked on.Three cheers to disney!..way to go"
5,great movie,My daughters (3 and 5) love this movie: and luckily its cute so I don't mind watching it over and over again
3,Didn't live up to the hype for me... :(,"While my kids do enjoy this movie, I was disappointed in it. The plot was weak and unbelievable (even for a Disney movie). The singing was good and fun, but it wasn't enough to redeem the movie for me."
3,Mixed feelings...,"Wonderful movie I've loved since seeing it in the theater, but boo on Pixar for the ripoff of no extras at all on this disk. Really? a 20 minute bit on alternate beginnings? Really? Whatever happened to some extras for our hard earned money? Very disappointed.Movie is a 5 star.Stinginess is a 0."
5,Love this movie,This is a wonderful family movie. My family loved it. We watched it multiple times. I highly recommend it for a family.
5,Tangled,The movie showed up in time for Christmas Eve movie night and so far even with the repeated views still works great!!
4,Cute Movie,"My little girl liked this movie, and I thought it was cute. I would recommend it as a fun movie night."
4,funny and engaging,"down graded one star - right in the middle of the 3D version it froze (did this on two different players). we had to return it for refund/exchange. this one seems to work fine. (yes we run the blu ray updates weekly to be sure we have the latest).This by far has been one of the best family animated films in years for the whole family.our neighbor daughter loves the princess while her brother likes the horse. who didn't.the sound track matched the images and the 3D while not Avatar was very good. my daughter a bit older) liked the storyline and animation. as an artist she felt engaged by the story, artwork and sound.I just laughed at the dude and how he bungles things and the horse (who's your friend or not) work thu the story to get the girl or did she get him.we need more like this."
1,Tangled VideoRental,"I rented this movie so my grandchildren could watch it on my Kindle HD while we were flying to Hawaii. Once we got in the air we were unable to watch it because we had not Internet coverage. When we got home and tryed to watch it, we were required to re-rent it or buy it. I'll never rent movies again from Amazon."
2,not totally satisfied,Buying movies from Amazon are hit or miss. I go out of my way to buy them new and sometimes they have the security sticker that you get in new movies and sometimes they don't. They are always rapped but this particular dvd had no security sticker over the opening so it makes it look cheaper and not new in my opinion. Especially when you give it as a gift.
5,A FAVORITE FOR SURE !,"This movie arrived FAST so we were really happy about that.It was just SO well done! We are older, and are looking for some sophistication with our movies and this one was a hit with everybody watching that night, young and old."
3,"Movie was great, amazon streaming not so good","Tangled is great, kids watched it before we entered disneyland every day (yes they were up that early). Unfortunately, it did not download direct on my laptop and had to stream it from Amazon... which was not so great. Netflix had no stutter, but Amazon kept dropping and having to restart. Finally downloaded it on my Kindle Fire and works great."
5,Great movie,Great movie and Great for all ages. Worth watching. It will have one and all laughing each time you watch.
2,Poor coating. Tip bent in package.,Poor red coating. Chips and flakes. Tip was bent in package. Non standard thread pattern. Adapters required. Quality is low. Unfortunate. I like the design.
2,Poor zipper quality,Zipper failed after about 20 uses. Left me without a closable bag in 15 degree weather.
3,"Good, But **Not for Backpacking**","The sleeping bag is well made, and fairly light. It kept me warm at 30 degrees, and I am betting it would at twenty as well. It is also pretty roomy inside for a ""mummy"" bag.However, it is NOT for backpacking. If you are camping this will work great, but it's too big to fit into a frame pack."
3,Nice bag but not for 25 deg.,"I bought two of these, mainly for 40-50 deg weather, assuming the 25 deg. rating wasn't correct. I was wearing a cold weather base layer, used a fleece liner, and still 25-30 degrees was cold! Three stars because it is a well made bag. But Extreme-Weather, not!"
3,Interesting for Genealogical Background,"This book has not been formatted properly for Kindle - it is hard to read. However if you don't live near the east coast where you could easily visit county historical societies, libraries or court houses for records, you may get some info from this book."
4,Star Trek: Next Generation - Borg,"This four tape/episode set includes, ""Q Who?"", ""Best of Both Worlds I & II"", and ""I,Borg"". ""Q Who?"" is the initial introduction to the borg where Q flings the enterprise to the far reaches of the galaxy. ""Best of Both Worlds"" was the overwhelming fan favorite and two part season finale (a full season after ""Q Who?"", where Picard is captured and the borg invade. Finally, ""I,Borg"" where the Enterprise captures an injured Borg drone. ""Q Who?"" and ""The Best of Both Worlds"" are Star Trek at its best, and can be followed even if you are new to the series. ""I, Borg"" leaves something more to be desired, and is quickly forgotten afterwards. Nevertheless, this is a great box set."
3,Too Tall !,"I fit this product on a 1999 TL.The top-(center} of the joint is too tall, to get it to fit properly, the mechanic had to file it off. If this is not done it will restrict the side to side turning of your wheels as it rubs against your ABS sensor.Why is this hump in the center (top)?"
4,Works fine,"Works as intended. The only drawback is that the cord is a bit short, so you cannot power the phone while using it as a gps on the windshield."
1,Watch out if you have a 6300 with latest firmware!,"Got this charger for my Nokia 6300 in Dec 2007. So far it's been working well, but after upgrading the firmware of my 6300 the phone refuses to charge, saying ""Charger not supported"".If this is caused by Nokia engineering they've screwed up - but if this charger is non-genuine I guess that may also be the cause. Buyer beware!"
4,Working well for me,"This charger is working well, it works with my Nokia 2320 go phone. I agree with other reviewers that it doesn't seem to plug easily into the car, but once in it is fine and no other problems for me."
4,Read other reviews,"I brought this charges but never used it, so please before you judge or make any kind of decision please read other review to make a fair decision."
4,Simple use...,I previously used the powder variety in another brand. I notice no difference and plenty of convenience using the capsules. I re-order this regularly.
5,A real back-saver,"I use this cushion against my back every day at work and it really helps to relieve the pain I sometimes get from sitting in a chair all day. I might get one for my car, too."
4,A definite must whether you like racing or blinging cars,"This game is packed with so much cool stuff, all the real cars and accesories. The gameplay is excellent, and the cars are on point. Great graphics! There should be a little more goal oriented things, and they definitely need to involve Brooke Burke some more, or someone else if she's not doing NFSU 3. Perhaps some actual footage of the hostess? Still, this game is a hot one."
3,s u c k s,this game is nothing infront of burnout 3 burnout 3 is my favorite racing game I own an xbox but played nfsu2 on my friend's xb and I also played it on ps2 this game just is r o t t e n arrgg!! it is a waste of 50 bucks this game is worth 20 bucks
5,Geniune Hawaiian Music,"Jerry Santos, Genuine Traditional and Contemporary Native HawaiianGuitarist and singer, a superb entertainer with lots of talent. His voice portrays many emotions and he writes a lot of his songs.He has won the Hawaiian Grammy and has his own group Olomana, where they play every weekend at the Hawaiian Village Hotel in Honolulu. All the pieces on this CD are done beautifully. I recommend Jerry's music highly."
1,Christianity is a cult created in the 3rd century. So you are correct...,"Messianic Judaism is NOT a cult created in the 3rd century. I'm glad you realize that. You keep leading people to a bankrupt cult, we'll keep pointing people to Yeshua/Jesus. And I don't need to be a prophet to tell you who's going to win in the end."
1,disappointing,"I have been involved in the Messianic Jewish Congregational movement for over 25 years, and I found Mr. Telchin's book to be at best inaccurate, and more directly to the point, the ravings of a disapointed, bitter man with a theological axe to grind. He is someone who has never invested himself into the Messianic congregational movement, and here seems to be trying to justify his cutting himself off from his own people by finding fault with a movmement that he could have enriched with his input had he not been so bitter.It is a pity when people become so bitter that they air their discontent for the whole world to see.I would reccomend this book to NO ONE who truly wants to understand or learn more about Messainic Judaism.A far better book on the subject, treating the subject in a more scholarly and unbiased fashion, by a non-member of the Messianic Jewish Congregational movement, would be Messianic Judaism, by Rabbi Daniel Cohn-Sherbok."
5,Excellent ! A timeless look about gamefish behavior.,"I read it 10 yrs ago and was impressed. Most or all recreational fisherman want to improve upon their productivity. A novice fisherman can learn where, when, how, and with what (s)he should do to improve productivity. For example: What do gamefish see? What is color to a fish? What causes fish to pursue your offering?"
1,Looks pretty,"This is a very attractive mixer but I have found it to be very impractical and am looking to replace it. It does not have a true slow speed - it flings batter around so much at the lowest speed that my dog immediately comes running when I use it, licking his chops. The beaters are annoyingly difficult to eject, and the unit is heavier and more cumbersome than other mixers I have had. I find myself yearning for the old ""vintage"" turquoise GE hand mixer with a variable speed wheel on top. In fact, I may just get one from an antique dealer. I am frustrated to death with this thing."
4,gift for mom,"got it for my mom for christmas. it replaced her 27 year old mixer that smelled like burning every time it got turned on. i havent actually used this one, but she said it is fantastic. even using the lowest setting it works great. neat storage for space management."
4,not bad,was going to buy a $250 machine because the cheesecake recipe called for a powerful mixer. decided since im not a sophisticated cook and would probably only use this once in a blue moon it would be sufficient. well it was more than sufficient. made the cheesecake and then bought a deep mixing bowl in case i ever used it again. its very powerful. love it. but it needs a deep mixing bowl for splattering purposes
2,Disappointing,"I bought the mixer expecting to receive the item pictured in the main description- that is, the mixer on the half-cirle stand. Instead, I received the mixer on the up-right display stand. To be fair, in the detailed description it does state that is the item, but the main photograph is misleading & I would've bought the other item if I had known I wouldn't be getting what was advertised."
4,works like a dream,works like a dream and has great style. it is light wieght and easy to use. great price. will tall all my friens about it.
5,Sunbeam heritage series mixer,"I love this mixer. It is powerful and works very well and I have no problems at all ejecting the beaters. Could be Sunbeam addressed this problem and corrected it. I love the way it looks in my kitchen! The storage of the beaters with the mixer was a brilliant idea, as I like to keep both my counters and kitchen drawers neat, clean and uncluttered. Obtw, I purchased mine at Target for $29.00.... ;) just saying..."
3,about same as others I've used recently -- not as good as in past,"I had expected it to perform better than less expensive mixers -- it does not. As reported in other reviews, the difficulty of ejecting the beaters is a flaw."
1,Kinda lame...,"Yeah I found this book to be really lacking in the whole ""cool"" category (and ""sweet"" category while I'm at it). I learn more from the history channel and old John Wayne videos. You should only buy this book if you go to West Point and they just closed book issue and your Professor is getting all up in your grill about buying one. If you buy this book for any of the following reasons...flog yourself:1) You think you will enjoy it2) To beef up your ""professional library""3) Cause your one of those ""militant type"" people that reads everything in the world about the Military, wear BDU pants tucked into your combat boots out in public, you have a ""Semper Fi"" bumpersticker on your car, and sport an extreme high and tight...yet your way too scared to actually join the military other than the Seacadets or Boy Scouts.4) Any other brutally terrible reason that has not been previously stated.(if you chose option three than feel free flog yourself (in the face) twice)Thanks, and happy shopping"
2,a item you can find in a garbage can,"first of all i'm a juggalo(a fan of icp) but thats not y i gave this a bad review i somewhat like eminem except for this album.... can u say sell-out there is some good songs on it so i couldnt give it a bad rateing but its got non of that ruthless attiude like in slimshady lp or the marshal mathers lp... if you wana check out some good artist in detriot check out Esham.. eminem is a big fan of esham and thats where he got his style from hell check out the slim shady lp song called i juss dont give a f*ck ""my mom hated me i'm a cross between manson ESHAM and ozzy"".. also em has a song on encore called yellow brick road i thought it was gona be a rip off of an icp song called yellow brick allyway .. but actually the songs about how he is hated in detriot for stealing a style that was created by esham and used by icp"
1,Worse Than Junk,These must be the tracks that were destined to be shelved & never see the light of day. No consistency whatsoever. One star because there's no 0 star option!!
2,Ummmmmmmm......,"Well first off i am a big eminem fan, i've liked him since day one and hearing his underground stuff before that too. I was really not feeling this album though. There are about 3 good songs on the album the rest seem like a quickly put together thing. Fans want an album that we can play alot. Most of the songs you hear them once and thats enough unlike the eminem show and the mashall mathers lp. Come on Slim, you gotta do it again playa !!!!!"
1,dissapointed,"I love eminem, and every single one of his albums up until Encore. This album was the worst album I have ever hear from Eminem, and Eminem's other albums are all great. I was expecting something to rival The Eminem Show, but it was more of a pop genre. It wasn't serious, and it was like Ja Rule's albums. Of course not as bad. Well I hope Eminem starts working hard on his next album, and not make crap and expect everyone to buy it. Of course hardcore Eminem fans who like anything he throws at them will. And heres a note to those Jackson lovers. @#$% U! Jackson is so white that I don't even think of him as black, and he a #$%en freak! He sounds like hes on some female hormones. Well I hope Eminem gets back on track and starts making serious tracks again, and I won't be buying encore."
4,Pretty Good Album,"It seems like the songs on the album are either really good, or suck, theres not really any in between songs. Hardcore Eminem fans probably wont like this album too much, but everyone else, give it a listen. The bonus disc is good too. Stand out songs are, Like toy Soldiers, mockingbird, never enough, and yellow brick road"
1,Eminem knows his audience,"i believe eminem's real fans will dislike this album... throughout the songs we can hear eminem say that he can sing what he wants in the songs and people will like it..they will like the beats therefore they will like the song..check out the rain man's lyrics at the end.. my 1st single clearly laughs at the people who only listen to the beats..d12's ""bitch"" song on their last album emimem says the same thing during the chorus...eminem knows that 80% of his audience don't even read the lyrics..as long as they can dance to some of his songs on the dance floor that's fine with him cause he's gonna sell CD'sthere are 2-3 good song on the album..that's about it.. lyrically there's some good rhymes but the fartin', the burpin' and the pukin' really ruins the album..."
1,is elvis leaving the building?,"Well well it seems eminem has put out an album that is on the wack side of the street. I like eminem actually and to see him put out an album like this is kind of disappointing. But you can tell when things like this are gonna happen. How many songs can you make about your mother, wife or how poor you were? What happens when you run out of things to say or you can't get any sillier? I tell you what happens..............ENCORE DELUXE EDITION. Beware of future eminem projects they will only get worse. If you want some dope eminem stuff check out the soundbombing songs and underground stuff he did."
1,My prediction came true...,"Back when Eminem came out I made a prediction. After he made his fortune, after he ranted and complained about his supposed hardship, after he plagiarized real music to the point of not having any more good material... that he would end up tanking. Because we all now know that he never had any talent to begin with, as with most rap ""artists"". This genre of music is on its death bed and people like Eminem are assuring its demise (Thank God)."
1,Eminem...... What happened?,"The new Eminem album is horrible. I can't believe he sold out like that. This album is a joke. I've been a fan for like 6 or 7 years and he lost it on this one. Eminem should have quit on The Eminem Show. He and his group have gone commercial. They're appealing to the kids and not the real hip hop heads, fans whatever you want to call it. Because of us they are where they are at now and they just drop us like a bad habit. Pathetic. The Encore album is stupid. Eminem should have done a new Slim Shady LP, that way he could have done something immature but really good for the real fans and something we would enjoy, not this pop stuff. I feel like I'm listening to Britney Spears. Eminem and D-12 been a fan and always will be, but D12 World and Encore, that doesn't even sound like you guys. I'm done."
5,"GreAt, but not as good as the eminem show","This is a great cd and i have enjoyed most of the songs but it will never top the eminem show, there are 3-4 songs that are catchy and that you will like, the rest is crap, im a big eminem fan so its hard to say that."
3,Eminem at it again,"Em's newest album doesn't live up to the previous ""The Eminem Show"" but it still has a few good tracks. I was looking for more rapping from Em and not a bunch of slow songs. The first song ""Evil Deeds"" is probably the best song on the cd in my opinion. It has a good beat and good lyrics.. something I expect from Eminem. Other tracks like ""A$$ Like That"" and ""My First Single"" and ""Never Enough"" are about the only other songs on the CD besides ""Just Lose It"" that are worth listening too, or at least the only ones you would want to bump in your car. To sum it all up, if your a die hard Em fan.. go ahead and buy it. But if your looking for rapping and fast paced beats like I was... listen to a friends CD first before you buy it!"
1,He just quit on us,"From all his albums i found this one the most dissapointing.I felt since he couldn't win the grammy for best album he just stopped trying.Instead of his good delivery since his first three records, he made little effort to top them all.I feel like he just led fame get to him and stopped caring."
1,Another Crappy spawn of The Eminem Show,"First off his voice got crappier and whinnier. I do like mosh but that it. No other song can give another play agian. It's pop mix with rap and you get this album like he doesnt want fans anymore, so fine good bye eminem because you suck more then vanillia ice. I perfer another vanillia ice album then this."
2,EM IS WACK,EM IS WACK. I DONT GET U KIDS ANYMORE. HE USED TO HAVE THE DRIVE BUT HE LOST IT. EM PLAYS AROUND TOO MUCH. HE HAS A FEW GOOD SONGS BUT IT FELT LIKE HE JUST CRAMBED IN A WHOLE BUNCH OF SONGS. THIS ALBUM HAS SOME OF THE WORST CHORISES I HAVE EVER HEARD. LOOK EM I KNOW U HAVE SOME SKILLS BUT BE A LITTLE MORE FOCEST. U COULD BE WAY BETTER
4,Encore on Par?,"I've had the cd for about a week.My first impression was disappointment.I mean ""The Eminem Show"" is hard to top but,after listening so many times i changed my outlook on it.Its not his greatest work. I am impressed though cuz the album shows how he has changed. Good or Bad i duno..Its not his crazy wild stuff like his past records but,songs like toy soldiers,mosh,puke,ass like that,and crazy in love will grow on you.In short its EMINEM so go pick it up fool..or he will come find you and kill you"
2,Eminem has made better.,"At first, I was so excited that Eminem had made a new album and I got it from my friend for Christmas. But after I started listening to it I was really disapointed. Eminem has made much better albums. On this album, I can honestly say there were about 3 songs that I liked. Everything else was just stuff hes rapped about before. Boring."
1,great if you're a fan of pop music,"eminem is not a rapper, he is a pop star, i have never been a fan of him but at least in the past he's had some motivation/hunger, now he's just plain ripping people off with this audio atrocity, it bothers me i wasted an hour of my life listening to this beer coaster of an album"
3,Where are the beats?,"Eminem is a very talented artist, and he displays his skill with words on Encore. At best, this album is o.k. It is a strong example of phonetics and wordplay. His lyrical flow is not enough to make up for the lack of depth and content of his lyrics. He does have a sense of humor, but hearing about Christopher Reeves again, and about his wife is not something you would want to listen to everyday. Eminem needs to get back to the insights he had on the Eminem show. The beats are very bland and plain on this album. It is hard to beleive Dr. Dre would make beats that are so simple. The melodies are lacking, and you find yourself wanting to add bits and pieces to the production. The production and lyrical content need to be stepped up-bottom line."
3,Kim Again !,"there was a time when i got chills hearing marshall mathers lyrical flow.i still think he remains one of the masters of rap, but unfortunately this CD sounds like ""eminem show"" left-overs. we are treated to more stories of Kim and his [lack-of] dad. i have to say i was sorely disappointed.marshall it's time to take your genius to the next level..."
3,"Encore, an average work.","I think this album is both good and bad. Some of the lyrical content has been recycled from his past CD's and some of the lyrics are kind of on the ridiculous side. I think Just Lose It is probably the best song from this CD, if you don't like that song, chances are that you probably aren't going to like anything else. I would say the best songs from here are Mockingbird, A* Like That, and Ricky Ticky Toc. Some of the other songs have good beats and I would listen to those second from my favorites, but there really isn't anything extremely memorable besides the tracks that I listed. Overall, this is not a bad effort, I think it's better than The Eminem Show (I didn't really care for that album), but it's nowhere near The Marshall Mathers LP (I think that's as great as Em is going to get, he really outdid himself there, it's going to be almost impossible to repeat that)"
2,Could of been better,"I was a huge Em fan before this album came out but the truth this album sounds like it was made to quickly and he didn't put any thought into the lyrics especially the hooks. Instead of having his usual one ""stupid"" song like ""Real Slim Shady"" or ""Without Me"" he put two or three on the album this time. And now hes using jibberish to rhyme instead thinking of something significant to say. I miss the stuff he came out with that actually had a message or some substance to it now it sounds like hes reminsicing over all the things that has happened to him. He's lost his creativity and he especially needs to stop singing in the songs. If you want Eminem at his finest buy Marshall Mathers LP that is by far his best album to date."
2,Just Not Very Good,"This just isn't as good as his past cds. I am a huge Eminem fan and am just disappointed. There are a few high points. The song with 50 and Dre is tight, but the rest just doesn't do it for me. Some of the beats are whack, and the song Mosh is awful. What was Dre thinking producing that one. And taking a shot at jojo, come on now, what is she, like 14? I'd save the cash and wait for something else"
4,What I Thought Of Encore,This Album is Really Funny and a Bit Stupid. My Favourite Song was One Shot 2 Shot Feating D12. And Ass Like That was Very Funny. The Worst Song Is Mocking Bird. Some Of The Songs are not even rap But It Is Still Good. Get It
2,What Happened?,"This was a TOTAL dissapointment for me, I am a huge fan of eminem and have all his albums up to this one..then of course i decided to finally get it even after some peeps had told me that it wasnt all that great but just becaue im an Em fan i decided to check it out anyway..bad choice, this album is nowhere close to his previous releases (Marshall Mathers LP in my opinion the best) I think its because he was off the drugs but who knows, I just hope this one isn't a sign of things to come from Em only 3 or 4 good songs on here in my view (""Mosh"" being the top track) this isnt an Em LP worth buying, i suggest bootleggin this or just borrow it before u run out and drop the bucks for it."
1,Eminem Is A Joke,"It's about time that people have wised up and see Eminem for the joke that he is. Ok...maybe he was a novelty at the beginning...like back in '99 but the self-riteousness, the attitude, and prolonged negativity can only take you so far.With ""Encore"", the formula is finally going thin. Anyone ever notice how he releases a cornball first single *which always sounds the same* then tries to go hardcore? Heck, even ""Just Lose It"" uses the intro from ""Without Me.""Hopefully the public is tiring of all of the sound-alike hip hop that is ruling the industry right now. Bring back people that can actually sing....or at least be more innovative than this yawn-fest."
2,TSK TSK TSK,"WITH THREE CLASSIC ALBUMS UNDER HIS BELT, ENCORE MIGHT JUST BE THE WORSTE ALBUM OF THE YEAR. I CANT BELIEVE HE ACTUALLY RELEASED SUCH TRASHY SONGS. GRANTED THERE ARE 2 OR THREE DECENT MESSAGES IN THE 76 MINUTES OF BABBLING ON, IT DOSENT DO ANYTHING TO SAVE THIS GARBAGE ALBUM."
1,Bad Meets Terrible,"Bloody terrible, Infinite is better. Eminem has always said he would retire before he put out a weak album, but i suppose that was bull. I once thought of him as a pure artist, but now.... I think one star is too generous, listen to Marshall Mathers LP or Slim Shady LP instead..."
1,Gave It A Chance And Hate It,"I tried to have an open mind and not simply be ""hatin'"" as people like to call it. Isn't it funny that just because you dislike something this guy does you are a ""playa hater"". Puhhhhlease. This cd is wackest of the wack. If Vanilla Ice had released this BS then people wouldn't defend this garbage. Eminem can rap (not that this such a great talent) I give him that but this album is like dirty nursery rhymes that would make Andrew Dice Clay embarrassed. ""Puke""??? Where's the quality control? ""A** Like That""? Em's a big baby because Triumph is wittier than he is. ""Mosh"" is more about self prraise than protest. People this cd is a stinkbomb. It's okay you can admit it."
1,Very Disappointed With Vanilla Shady,"Just when the guy was starting to impress me he drops this dogsh** of a cd. The lamest pop hip hop since you guessed it- the infamous Vanilla Ice. I was totally feeling ""Lose Yourself"" & ""Sing For The Moment"" but this new ""Encore"" made me realize those songs were an accident."
2,What was Em thinking???,"This one was garbage! I loved Eminem's old stuff but this album was the worst yet. He sings most of the songs which isn't too bad but gets annoying after awhile. The only song that I liked on this album was ""Just Lose It"" and all the other songs was just like he wrote them quick just to get another album made. I love Eminem and I'm a HUGE FAN but this album isn't worth listening to or buying."
1,Get Marshall Mather's D1ck Outta Ur Mouths,"U die hard eminem fans are morons. This cd as I said b4 is 500 degrees of a$$. People who are sayin this cd is good is either ""die hard eminem fans who will like anyhting Marshall puts out"" (Eminem could fart on the whole album with no music just em fartin and these queers would like it) or they are mentally retarded. Most of these kids who think they know anything about hip hop are morons especially if they think this cd is good. I use to love eminem. He was creative, original, and a awesome lyrcist. Now? Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeit I'm not so sure anymore, but what I am sure of is this cd is only good for to put ur beer on. So die hard em' fans who are sayin this cd is GREAT, Get Marshall's D1ck Outta Ur Mouths!"
1,Two Words,"Vanilla Ice. But since that won't post because it's not long enough, I'll add it's obvious the black community does not embrace this guy anymore. If anything Dre and 50 are just using him to make an extra buck. Vanilla Ice but with a see through fake attitude. Somebody needs to kick his ass."
1,Again,There's the faggot again giving the cd 5 stars.He uses different nick names and gives the cd 5 stars and does short reviews.Do you love eminem or something?You faggot b*tch.Stop doing that.We are sick of you.[...][...]
1,this is the worst cd i bought!!,"i was really excited to get it, but there's only a couple of good songs, the rest is crap. it's obvious that eminem didn't care about quality, just quantity. get the songs from itunes to save some $$!"
2,Dissapointed,"ok first off let me say that i'm a huge Eminem fan. He's probably my favorite mainstream rapper. But his new album just isnt' up to his potential. On alot of the songs he doesn't even rap. Its really dumb. But there are still a few good songs that have Eminems sick flowing in them like ""lose it"" ""mosh"" and ""never enough"" but besides that theres not much good rapping which is bad, because Eminem is one of the best rappers out there. well i hear hes planning to release another album this year hopefully its better."
4,Sharissa Jones listen me,wait stop if you dont even like eminem why are you reviewing it you never even probally heared it and if you did buy it then your just what u say the teeange girls are.... its one thing if a eminem fan rates it bad but some stupid girl who only heared his clips and some songs on the radio you suck
3,Not Bad,"While it's no Slim Shady LP or Marshall Mathers LP, Encore isn't as bad as some people keep making it out to be. Some songs, such as 'Puke', don't belong on any album, but there are definitely some great songs here. 'Like Toy Soldiers' is a great song, and 'Never Enough' w/ 50 and Nate Dogg has a killer beat and great lyrics. Ultimately, the best song on the CD is the last, 'Encore' w/ Dre and 50."
3,not the best but think about it...,"ok, on his latest album (recovery) eminem says straight up that he was on drugs when he made ""encore."" he himself acknowlegdes that most of the songs are kind of stupid and just for fun. think about it, he worked so hard on his first 3 albums so maybe it makes sense that he has some fun on his 4th. maybe it was writer's block. who knows? there are several excellent songs on the album so i would say that it is still worth buying even just to support eminem and have an album to play when you feel like listening to some goofy beats."
2,What happen eminem,When I first heard of the album coming out I couldn't wait to get it. When I heard it I couldn't believe that the album was that bad.I was hoping for this album to be more like the eminem show or the marshell mathers Lp.Insted it's nothing like those albums. I know that eminem is putting out a greates hits collection but please em' before you do that make another album because I know you could do better than this.
3,I'm A Em Fan But He Fell Off A Lil Bit Wit Dis One,"I been down wit Em since the Slim Shady LP. He was a different type rapper and nobody had ever seen a style like his. I heard all his otha albums and they was all tight. Encore has some good songs, but then some of it is jus stupid. Songs like Big Weenie, My First Single and a couple of othaz that I jus cant stand. Songs like Like A Toy Soldier and Mockingbird are good and got good messages and lyrics. I hope if Em makes anotha album, its betta than this one."
4,Good but underwhelming,"This cd is decent. Yea, its not a Marshall Mathers LP or an Eminem Show but it is ok. As most poeple noted, the rhymes arent as good as they used to be. I've had the cd since Nov. 6, but I still have't bought it. I don't think it would be worth it. The CD is OK with Standouts such as Mockingbird, Spend some time, Puke and Like Toy Soldiers. Decent CD but room for improvement"
1,Shameless Rip Off,"This cheap film shamelessly rips off the title ""Forbidden Zone"" in order to confuse it with Richard Elfman's cult masterpiece of the same title."
2,Almost the same story,I liked the size and the fact that it was very quiet. When I first got it (winter time) it kept the temperature where I set it at 55 degrees. It did seem that the it had a hard time keeping the setting when the weather got hot. I had it for almost 20 months and it died. The fan no longer spins and it is clicking as others have stated. Good while it lasted but didn't last long enough.
1,Piece of complete junk. Major design flaw,It's a piece of junk. Just like every other review here mine died. I'm going to enjoy taking it back to [...] so I don't get stuck with this piece of junk.Stay away from Vinotemp.
2,I thought it sucked!,"This game was not fun, and overpriced (I paid $17.99 for a used copy). I wish I could get my money back.I'm straight outta the hood, and thought this game was vulgar at best, and not representaive of 29th and Crenshaw, where I stay.Don't buy this one!"
1,How to edit JUST 40 photos,"This book has a CD with 40 photos, and includes specific instructions on how to edit those photos. Want to edit your own photos? Then this book is of little use to you, except in the unlikely event you want to make the EXACT same edits. When it comes to the edits, it does not instruct you WHAT you are doing or WHY you are doing it - it is just ""click this button, enter values 10, 19, and 245"" with nothing to help you understand why you are clicking that or using those specific buttons. I have read 6 books on photshop elements, and this is the only one I found that was completely unhelpful. The CD does not add value - it has only the sample photos and a ""trial"" version of elements 3 that is easily downloaded from adobe's website (if you want a trial version)."
2,it's ok....,"The Book is simple, alone it is not enough to learn Elements but as an addition to other books, you will find in it useful hints. You do have to apply them to your own photos by adjusting their instructions since they teach by using their photos and giving exact settings for that photo. Don't buy if it's the only book you will own, good as another source!"
5,How Cool!!,"My son loves this toy! I picked it up cause it looked cool, and it is all kept in one container which is great. But it glows, he can make cool creaturs from it, and easy to bring around. I highly recommend!"
4,Cute as Heck!,"Product is so cute on my son. He really thinks he is Spiderman with it on. However, it is not as durable as I'd hoped. I think it's made more for a Halloween Costume and not to be played in each and every day. The zipper started to tear away after just a couple of weeks of play. Please note though, my son wants to wear it all day every day, and any clothing can wear out with that kind of use. :)"
2,Bought this for a teacher in my building,"Bought this for a teacher in my building that was having a time management problem, I never read it myself"
5,A must for BJJ players,"Excellent! This and Passing the Guard are very well done. I think they may have used too much space sometimes for drills that are simplistic (e.g. p.28-29, 32 pics showoing Moriera spinning his legs?). But the detail, as in the first, is better than I have seen in any Bjj book. The Gracies should take note. With the exception perhaps of Rodrigo's Path to Black Belt and Peligro's The Essential Guard."
3,Wrong versions,"At least two of the recordings on this CD were not the versions listed in the insert, but were later recordings of the same songs done by the same artists."
5,great band Eisley Marvelous Things,"Growing up home-schooled and cable-less in the East Texas town of Tyler, the DuPree kids had a lot of time to develop their imaginations, carving out an odd, insular little fantasy world. Their band name is a Star Wars reference, and their music could be dubbed Narnia-pop: Singer-songwriter Stacy (the youngest at 15, she leads two sisters, a brother and a neighborhood friend) looks and sounds like something straight out of British fabulist C.S. Lewis. Here she plays Alice, guiding us through a misty, minor-key Wonderland populated by scores of ""Marvelous Things"" - mermaids, horses that grow from the ground, bats with butterfly wings and two-part harmonies that swoop and soar. Dorky? Sure. But with songs this full of imagination and existential yearning, Eisley can hoard their 36-sided dice and Magic cards with pride."
1,screaming anoying offical,"This song is so bad, so so so so bad.Every time I hear that song I go outof the room."
4,pretty addictive : as usual with Jason Falkner !,"As far as I'm concerned,pop music can't be better than this and a pop musician can't be more gifted than is this guy.No.Definitely.Like with every one of his previous CDs ( AUTHOR UNKNOWN and CAN YOU STILL FEEL ),you can hear it's top quality at the very first time you're listening to these songs but you'll have to wait ( at least,that's what happened with me )a little in order to be totally hooked but then,you're in Pop heaven ! Like me now ! Why only four stars then ? BECAUSE IT'S ONLY A EP ! I actually wanted more !"
2,poorly made,"I bought my husband this coat for Christmas and within a couple of weeks, the coat ripped by the button area. In addition, several of the buttons began falling off. It was clearly poorly made- a big disappointment since I spent extra for real leather and to get it from a store like Macy's. Luckily they have a good return policy. Unfortunately my husband fell in love with the coat and we can't find another that he likes."
1,Endless supply of belts required if you have pet hair!,"I have two cats and a big hairy dog, so you can imagine the pet hair! Not very good on hardwood floor, but unlike the ones I had before, this upright does a great job picking up pet hair off the carpet. Bad news is I've gone through both belts in about 6 vacuumings! Only one 12'x12' room in my house is carpeted, too! Now I'm stuck with yet another upright that will end up on my front lawn on a garbage day, unless of course I find a new belt. So far I've tried with no success.Also, if you don't like noise or burning smell, I would not recommend this vacuum."
1,This vac really sucks,This is the worst vac I have ever owned. I have had the Shark for 2 week it just stops working every 5-10 minutes and then you have to wait for 1 hour to start again. The suction is not what's advertised I have to vacuum the same area 2-3 time before it clean. I switched from a Hoover cyclone bagless...I have learned my lesson and am buying another Hoover.
5,Chicago at their best,This is one great CD. I hope I can find it on Cassette also.This way I can listen while I'm driving.
3,gift,this was a gift & I'm not sure how the person who received liked it. I just know he likes zombie movies
5,I am proud to own the trillogy.,"I love the movies. I hated trying to watch the movies on TV. Now, I can watch them when I want."
3,Useful for some,"This is for the man who is willing to express himself in writing. For many, it will just sit on your bookshelf. My advice, read Eldredge's book and take action in your life. If you buy the field manual, it will only help if you commit to writing and expressing yourself in it. I did find it helpful for leading a small group study."
3,Interesting format,Have yet to really get in to it. Interested to see how it ties with the book from front to back.
5,Go On Michelle,"Awesome album. To answer that question, 'All You Wanted' unplugged version is the bonus track"
5,Awesome CD.,"This CD is great. Michelle Branch is an awesome musician. She writes her own music, she plays her own instrument (guitar), and she can sing. This is a great CD. I recommend for everyone to buy it."
5,SHE ROX!,"Michelle branch is a hardcore new talent that as soon as I heard on the radio, i fell in love with. She is so bright and so peacful and has a new flavor of music that i love. She needs to be more recognized. My favorite track is track 7 ""sweet misery"" its beautiful!"
1,AWFUL,Really only half a star...Michelle Branch pilescliche on top of cliche in this featherweight debut.I didn't think it was possible to create a sound thatsounded like watered-down Jewel (since Jewel iswatered-down Melissa Etheridge (Who's watered downBruce Springsteen)) but she's done it. Keep your money.
5,a really great CD,"as i love pop/rock and other styles of music i have a great surprise when i bought this cd,all the songs are great but for some songs the lyrics are to girlish,anyway,i love this cd and hope that michelle will last a long long long time.my favourite is goodbye to you,because the lyrics and the rythme touched me so much,and it's also on buffy the vampire slayer...one of my favourite show,anyway,a really great cd wrote from a 18 year old teenager for 18 year old teenagers,and also the older and younger.so what R U waiting for,go buy it!!..."
2,Not the 'Goodbye To You' you're looking for,"I bought this for the song 'Goodbye To You', which appeared in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode 'Tabula Rasa', but the version on this album is different and not nearly as good. The Buffy version is simple and dramatic; the album version has been remixed with additional instrumentation to make it sound a lot like everything else on the album: not terrible, but pretty forgettable. The whole thing is more mainstream and formulaic than I hoped.Edited to add: The album version is not a re-write, it's how the song was written. For the Buffy episode Josh Whedon wanted it changed to be more sombre."
5,Michelle Rocks!,"I'm sorry, but she has to be the greatest out there! I used to hate music (seriously) until I heard Michelle. There is so much garbage out there today. I'm even taking up the guitar so I can play her awesome songs. Michelle is #1!"
5,what a wonderful artist,"Michelle Branch is a girl who can sing really well she play the guitar and I love her song everywhere. She is a hottie too. She won a MTV Video Music Award, and Grammy. It's been a while since she's put out an ablum maybe she's taking a break but I hope she come out with another one soon."
2,No Spirit,"Very well put together and completely uninteresting. While Michelle has a nice voice and can play an instrument, she apparently has nothing new to say. In one song she actually says ""in this crazy, mixed-up world"". Unless you are under 15 years old buy something by an angry young women like Fiona or Alanis instead."
4,Pretty good,"Michelle Branch's debut release is pretty good. Her breakout hit ""Everywhere"" is a classic pop/rock tune, and most of the rest of her CD is consistent. The Spirit Room is a worthwhile purchase in my opinion. Branch's harsh chops may annoy after awhile, but hey, it's really her songs that make her such a great singer/songwriter."
3,hmmm...,"this girl has a annoying voice, but her songs are good, she has great lyrics and she plays the guitar which is my favourite instrument, my favourite song is ""everywhere"" that i'm sure you have already heard.what i say is : cool songs, but annoying voice..."
5,Michelle Branch a gifted singer / songwriter,"I strongly encourage anyone who hasn't gotten a copy of this album to do so. Michelle Branch shows great writing and singing ability on this record, which originally came out in 2001. There's a strong light rock / pop performance, with Michelle's powerful vocals, catchy melodies and hooks, along with memorable, meaningful lyrics in every tune. I, an avid music lover, give it a full five stars. You will not be disappointed."
2,I'm glad I borrowed this from the library......,"Okay, I love the singles by Michelle Branch. All you wanted, Everywhere, Breathe and Are you Happy Now are all great songs. I was at the library with my grandma and I saw this CD on the rack. I wanted to try it out because I had heard her singles and I liked them. But this CD does not live up to her singles. Michelle's voice is whiny, annoying and after each sentence in a song, she'll take in this annoying breath.Good Gravy-she sounds like Avril! I can't stand these annoying alternative pop stars. I thought Avril was bad-but this is horrendous. The songs are lame and boring(except the singles). Not to mention unoriginal.You know, she would have a lot of potential if she had other people help write her songs-better yet, don't write the songs at all.I'm soooooo glad that I checked this out at the library. Otherwise, I would have wasted fifteen bucks."
2,the new alanis?,"its not really a complement really is it,being compared to miss irony herself,she always made mediocre songs and so does Branch.we don't really need her 'insight' in the world we have already got the likes of jimmy eat world to do that sort of stuff(and they do it much better too) not do we need anoither solo female with a guitar.this album is impossible hate,difficult to like unless you really really love alanis in which case there is really no point in you getting this album as it is like a collection of her b-sides.yes it really isn't that good."
3,Not too bad,"I bought this album for my younger sister because she is into pop, and I actually discovered the artist for her. She was being played on my favorite alternative/rock radio station. Well the song ""Everywhere"" is obviously great. A couple of the other songs on the album are worth grooving to. This artist is an inspiration for teenagers out there. Anyone who loves to write poetry can also appreciate where Michelle Branch is coming from. Buy it if you want something easy to listen to, because this is all about those hormonal emotions to a flowy tune."
3,Jason,if you like masked murderes that will always retun then these movies will be a liking to you the good guys win untill the next movie comes out
1,Misrepresentation of product,"The one-star rating is for the company, not the product. As was a previous reviewer, I too was misled in thinking I was going to receive the meal replacement, but instead received the meal supplement. These are two totally different products. I should've listen to person who reviewed this previously, but I was thinking that maybe that was a one-time mistake as no one else seemed to have the problem...WRONG! This misrepresentation really needs to be corrected! If you are looking for the meal REPLACEMENT, order elsewhere."
4,A Good Overview of Journaling,"I have now read two books on journaling. I was pleased with this volume's range of material, and the simplicity of the presentation. Neubauer presents a variety of journaling methods, and many of those methods were new to me. I also appreciated the tips on good writing techniques.This book is an excellent starter for journaling, providing much breadth and little depth. Read Neubauer's work, see which journaling types appeal to you, then buy books that focus on those types. If you want a journaling primer, this one should serve your purpose."
2,A bunch of fluff writing ...,"Luckily, I bought this one used, so I didn't give any money to the clearly money-hungry person who wrote it. It seems like a bunch of a freelance writer's articles about journaling put together into one big book. If you are expecting ideas and inspiration to help you figure out what to write in your journal, or to think of new things to write about, don't buy this book. I gave it two stars instead of one because it does have a some things - just none that were of interest to me. If you think of writing in a journal as a chore that you have to do every day (as mentioned by a previous reviewer), or are interested in learning what journal to buy, the different types of journals, what pen you should use, the history of journaling, the benefits of journaling ... then you might find this book helpful. But, in my opinion, it's just a bit of research and a lot of fluff writing that any professional writer could put together and call a book."
2,Meh but OK,This is not the controller i though i was getting meaning DON'T BELIEVE THE PICTURE!!!!!! This is either a dream-pad or an innovation controller this troll will be sending you. Color unknown which did not bother me its just that i was expecting what was in the picture an original controller. I have not used it yet but there are plenty of scratches left on there form someone who thought this was a con too. Maybe the seller should change the pictures.
2,Not really the same product.,Open the box to find not a dream cast controller but an off brand. Still works but the red button sticks and you have to mash it for it to respond. Not the greatest....to bad.
1,I thought this company would never make a bad knife.....boy was I wrong!,"The blade on this knife is too thin. It tore, perpendicular to the sharp edge, similar to the way aluminum foil tears. I would never buy this knife again! Fortunately, Amazon issued a full refund."
4,Filter w/o Dust Cup,"Filter fits perfect for our Shark. Text description for product says the item is the filter with no reference to the dust cup screen. The box for the filter states the dust cup screen is included and it is clearly shown in the photo outboard of the filter; however, no dust cup screen comes with this purchase. Your purchase is for the filter only. This was not an issue since we saved our dust cup screen for re-use if needed."
4,same phone?,"Are we all talking about the same phone here? I haven't had any problems with it and using it is a breaze. I bought this phone after I wanted to change my calling plan so I wouldn't get stuck with roaming charges while I was away, far from my calling area. My old phone (also an LG) wasn't compatible with this new calling plan because it was embedded with the old AT&T service. I love the fact that I can download MP3 ringtones to this phone because that was one thing that I was looking for. I also like the fact that it has a speakerphone. It does not have a camera, and I was not looking for one. I already own three very good stand alone cameras, why bother with another?? I was although a little aggravated having to re-enter all of my old phone book information because that's the only way you can do it. The manual is not hard to read at all unless you are dyslexic."
1,Whaaat???,"There is a slight background noise constantly. I am easily heard on the other end, but I can't hear whom I'm talking to well at all, it's like there is a huge distance between us. If there is ANY noise on my side, I can't hear at all. As well, the microphone is not near my mouth but way over on the right side. Perhaps this unit is defective? I'm sending it back immediately. I'm really sorry I chose it, this does not live up to the good recommendations. Back to Plantronics!"
3,pickle reach,I'm sorry to say that I have not used this item yet. I did test it when I first received it and it appears to get the fork itself stuck when you are retrieving.
1,"Like all her records, its all about the producer","Download the first two songs, don't waste your money on the rest. Madonna has made a career out of hiring the best and most innovative producers to compensate for her lack of talent. This record is no different, if you like this record praise the producer, if you hate it, blame the producer, Madonna has nothing to do with it."
1,Great Pictures in the Sleeve,"The pictures of Madonna are great, she looks really good and she put a great deal of time and energy into making the pictures look great.But the music is sad. And its not dance music, its sit and listen blues music. The ""Hung Up"" is a 'decent' dance song, but not like her ""Over & Over"" or ""Burning Up"". The rest of the album is very trancy, dubby monotonic songs. Maybe her voice is gone and she has to use 'gimmic' synths to make it. I don't know. But it is far below her standards. She has done many incredible dance songs.But Madonna, this is not dance music!!!"
1,KEEP YOUR RECIETS!,be ready to retern this is not a good cd if you heard hung up buy it it is best song on it face it everyone screws up in there carrer madona will come back this is not her best and you know it
2,Expect to be Disappointed,"Only a hardcore Madonna fan will be interested in purchasing this album, as I did without having heard a single song. It was a bitter disappointment after her really great album ""American Life,"" which had great tunes and great lyrics. ""Confessions on a Dance Floor"" hearkens back to the bland and boring style of ""Ray of Light"" without the benefit of interesting lyrics. In fact, many of the lyrics sound like they were borrowed from other Madonna albums or even other people's songs. The first few songs are interesting, but the album quickly becomes repetitious and dull. You would do better to listen to the album a few songs at time (like in sets of three or four) to avoid being bored. If you are looking for an album to prove to you what a great entertainer Madonna is, steer clear of this one!"
2,Music grat.... CD to the trash...,Even when the music is great...the cd doesn't play on the computer!!!!so... I give 2 stars... because the bad product....
5,Give me a break!!,"Anyone who listens to this and doesn't give it 5 stars isn't a Madonna fan--never has been and never will be. This CD is incredible and it's EXACTLY what most of us have wanted for years. Madonna's remixed singles have always been better than her radio edits, so this record skips all that radio edit stuff and goes straight to the remixes! It's the best ever--watch it grow on the skeptics."
5,The Tiki God confesses...,"She truly is a Pop Goddess Phenom! By far her best and most exciting work since Ray of Light, Madonna pushes ahead to the future with her own brand of killer, and totally danceable, pop music. The entire album engulfs the listener in beautiful sound - it seems the entire cosmos was captured in making this record. It pulses through you and you can't help but move to the groove. Almost every track on this masterpiece is worthy of chart topping success. The lyrics are clever and the production is out of this world. My personal fav's are Isaac, Jump, Sorry, Future Lovers, and Hung Up. To those who were left weeping by the American Life spectacle there is no need to be cautious, with Confessions, for there is NO ""folktronica"" to be found on this album. This is the Madonna you have been waiting for - back to her ""roots"" but moving forward at the same time. Pure magic - pure Madonna."
2,BUY THE SINGLE AVOID THE ENTIRE CD - A BORE.,"I AM PERPLEXED THAT SO MANY PEOPLE LIKE THIS CD - I HAVE TRIED MY BEST TO LIKE IT, BUT TRY AS I MIGHT, I FIND IT BORING. I MEAN, NOTHING ON THE LP COMES CLOSE TO THE CATCHY HUNG UP SINGLE - AND FOR THIS, LADY MADGE HAD THE HELP OF SUPERTROUPERS ABBA. AND IS IT JUST ME, OR DOES ANYONE ELSE FIND HER HUNG UP VIDEO UNREAL AND PREPOSTEROUS - DOES ANYONE REALLY BELIEVE THAT A 47 YEAR OLD WHITE LADY WOULD BE DANCING IN A BLACK CLUB WITH TEENAGERS? OR FOR THAT MATTER, I DON'T THINK BLACK TEENAGERS WOULD BE DANCING TO MADONNA AT ALL. IN OTHER WORDS, ACT YOUR AGE MADGE."
5,great cd,"I have the unmixed version. Just a question though - there is no ""borrowed"" stardust rifts, no ""can u feel it"" riffs or ""papa dont preach"" rifts! They sound completly different!"
1,Boring boring boring,"My title says it all, boring boring boring.The same thing over and over again.I think Madonna owes me the amount I spent on this boring cd.I can't imaging why people think this is good music.Mediocre at best.The only good part was borrowed from Abba."
5,Survival of the fittest,"To be honest with you, I checked this disk out purely because of my amazement at Madonna's staying power. I mean, how can a star be consistently successful and receive huge publicity on a regular basis? Here in China, we hear about her almost every day. Remembering some of her catchy signature songs like Holiday, Papa Don't Preach, La Isla Bonita, Like A Prayer, Take A Bow, and Music, I've decided to buy this super-hyped album. And, thank you Madonna! You entertain me so much with your Confessions On A Dance Floor. Hung Up will (if not already) become another classic tune of yours. Now, I know why you remain such a huge star after all these years. All hail the persistent queen."
1,Lame,It only took about 2 listens to realize that this is the same Madonna schlock wrapped in a shiny new package. Same boring songs (can we have another about what fame means or doesn't mean to her?) with slick production. She is completely out of new ideas so she has to rely on a producer to make it sound fresh. This CD is lousy.
5,Dancing Queen,"Judging from this CD, she deserves every ego-boosting title given by the media (not that what they say really matters anyway) Madonna, I love your music so much. Please come to Toronto again when you world-tour. I bet you know Toronto loves you to death."
1,You'd be sorry if you bought this,Confessions from madonna is one hell of a bad album and one of the worst of this century.I wonder what people find good about her and her music.I find this album and music boring.Stay away from this and wait for the forthcoming Iron Maiden album.
5,Wow Wow Wow,"What a smash this record has become. After owning it, I've become clear why. From Hung Up to Like It Or Not, the album proves to be a seamless slide yet each song still stands from one another. I'm particularly thrilled by the slide from Forbidden Love to Jump. Such a goosebump it gives me."
2,Buy Ministry of Sound Instead,This C.D is Horrible! she should be executed for shamelessly using An ABBA sample as heavily as she does..shame Madonna..You really dont have anymore tricks up yopur sleeve anymore do you???Hung Up is the only standout track..
5,"Hmm... Yeah, right.","Give over with the 1 star reviews already - this album is a masterpiece. Don't like it? Obviously you have no ear for good dance music.And tell me - Mariah's ""LAMBS"", why would you want to buy the Platinum Edition of TEOM? It's just another cash in.Madonna is the queen and that's that. End of."
4,Time goes by so slowly...when u listen to Madonna!,"I'm 25yrs old and I feel 13yrs old again! WHOOHOO! Madonna somehow is able to mystically bend time and age. This album is amazing! It's truely as if Madonna can never not tap into her inner teen spirit. The song's beats are nonstop! The energy is booty shaking fun. No poltical views (American Life didn't win Kerry the election, good try Madge! but America hated your album)This album isn't self indulgent, it's just pure fun clubbing energy! I love How High it's such an classic Madonna song. And you can't help but fall in love with I Love New York! Anyway Madonna has always paved the path for worthy Pop music and this album just once again redirects us to how good and intresting Pop music can be. I hope all who buy it LOVE IT! because MADONNA RULES!"
5,Just Madonna,"If you are a fan of Madonna, you will find this album very interesting. However be careful, cause if you are missing somewhere Madonna's beat, you may not like it. I think it's great, but much different from Madonna's style. As we all probably know, she is unusual and unique and all her previous albums are different from one another.Have fun"
5,Some have called it religion.........this is not a coincidence,"Madonna's new album is as perfect as an album can get. It is a superbly crafted sonic journey, from start to end, and when it's over, you'll want to go again.Yes, all the positive reviews are spot on, and the critical acclaim is well deserved. Don't think, just click the 'add to cart' button, and give your senses an underground disco rush."
5,Great !,"This album is so amazing. I can't stop playing it. My favorite songs are Future Lover, Jump and Get Together. What are you waiting for ? Get it now !!!!!"
5,A Masterpiece,"As a huge Madonna fan from way back in the 80's, I have to admit it was hard to dislike anything she created. However, after trying desperately and unsuccessfully to like her last album, ""American Life,"" I was somewhat wary of how ""Confessions"" would sound. All I can say is ""Wow!"" She's back, and with possibly her best album ever. I cannot stop listening to it, and there has never been a Madonna record I could just play continuously and not get tired of hearing. Virtually any song (except for the final three in my opinion) would make an ideal single. My personal favorites are ""Future Lovers,"" ""Jump,"" ""I Love New York,"" and ""Sorry,"" but they keep changing the more I listen to the cd. For best results, crank this one way up and let the superior production take you away to another world. Thanks, Madonna, for giving pop music yet another much-needed shot in the arm and showing us once again why you are indeed the queen of pop."
5,Real Dance floor Album,"This is a unbeleivable dance music CD. Very nice job by Madonna. If you love rythmic dance music, buy this album, its worth it. I am giving five star, bcz all tracks are beautiful. WoW............."
5,Perfect.,"No rapping this time. And I love it.""Confessions On A Dance Floor"" is great.Don't buy this if you are too critical of Madonna, because this time, she is just having fun.There are a few of you out there who are bound to hate this CD, just to be difficult. Don't."
3,what to do with it.......,"I'm not really sure what to do with this cd.... the ""special edition"" doesn't really come with a case to keep it in, and it's not really good enough to leave in my cd player all the time........ not Madonna's best work, although..... it is better than most of the digital pollution floatin' around these days"
5,The album we all wanted Madonna to make for years!,"No doubt this CD will get alcolades of praise from everyone, everywhere, but I had to put in my thoughts. It is perfect. That is all. Perfect. Every song, every beat, every sound, everything. I am loving Hung Up and Forbidden Love the most, but NY, Let It Will Be and the rest are all fantastic as well. Personally, I think this is Madonna's best yet. Certainly a great comeback from the tepid American Life. Thank you, Madonna!"
5,Madonna is the Best!,"What a great cd!!! What a sound, what a rhythm! The songs remind me of my own ""discotime"", and I'm having so much fun listening to this music. Makes me feel like dancing! Thank you Madonna! Please move on!But why do you put two videoclips and their making-ofs only onto the Japan-CD? Your fans do not understand that!!!"
5,WWWWWOOOOOOOOWWWWW!!!!!!!,"THIS ALBUM IS AMAZING!!! I can't believe that after more than 20 years, Madonna can come up with the best work of her career. There are no fillers on this album. The only problem is deciding which track is my favorite. It seems to change at every listen. BRAVO MADONNA. You really delivered this time."
2,Same Old Stuff,Just a rehash of previous work; nothing new here. Just sounds like tired Madonna trying to throw out one more album for her fans.
3,Surprisingly off in just about every way,"I dont expect profound music from Madonna and she's made some truly great dance tunes in the last 2 decades. What's strange about this CD is how this ""dance album"" almost completely misses the mark as a dance album.Hung Up is catchy enough but the other tracks go downhill fast. The thing is -- all of these tracks could have been better with a different production of them. What we get is too treble-heavy electronic beats and an almost complete lack of lyrical ""hooks"" to draw you into the songs.Really misses the mark."
5,Need to Listen Over and Over to Gain Appreciation,"First let me say this is much, much better release than her previous album. When got home i put into my X-box and began my first listen beyond the already immensly popular single ""Hung Up"". I was intrigued by what I heard, i couldnt finish a single song, i was too anxious to get to the next song. Then i plugged the entire album into my i-pod and have been playing it ever since over and over. It has a very Late Disco, early 80s music, (which is hard to notice at first, but it really does) But in each song one can also detect a futuristic feel to it, (a Future Disco of sorts) Mark my words: This will be the album to recon with in 2006!by faves areSorry (my 3rd favorite)Jump (my 2nd Favorite)Isaac(my 1st favorite)All in all, its a good Club/Dance Album."
5,Can't Stop Listening!!!,"Just to correct Jon Karsen ""rochas70"", the producer is Stuart Price. Confessions is an amazing and timeless album. I can't wait to see what she comes up with next. Her previous two albums were duds. Madonna got back to her music, her sound, her image, and her attitude. So awesome!!!"
4,The confession? She wanted to make you dance again!,"I must say this album took me in a different direction than American Life. COAD has a lighter, easier, and bouncier sound than the more darker, angry undertone that was American Life, even more than Music before it. Madonna knew to create something familiar and she didn't disappoint. COAD from start to finish was done as a 12 track disco rundown of classic Madonna style, think (Madonna-the first album or Like a Virgin) when it was about having a good time. This is club music, damn near rave music. I enjoy all the songs on this album for different reasons and if you are a Madonna fan or have been at some point, this album will be comfort food for you. I was happy Hung up hit the top ten on Billboard #7, although I'm very bothered by Sorry hitting #58, due to lack of radio airplay. My favorite songs are a tie between Sorry and Like It or Not. I hope she wins a Grammy for this album, either Best Pop Vocal Album or Dance Recording."
5,It's a great album,"Even if you don't much care for Madonna, this is a great album, with lots of energy and fun mixed in with some really amazing dance beats.I'm glad to see that Madonna hasn't lost her touch."
5,Excellent duffel,"I like the duffel very much, perfect material, size and design for me.only thing want to complain is the two zippered valuables pockets are a little too small and tight. It always need extra effort to put wallet and key chains it. Anyway, not a big deal, still an excellent product."
3,Crusader great song but not great album!,Crusader is one of Saxon's best songs but thisalbum isn't one of their best. the productionand mix is horrible. I've listen to this a fewtimes and I just can't get into it and I'm abig fan! I don't know what it is. Other thanLittle Bit of What You Fancy and Just Let MeRock I don't hear anything else that stands out.Some others seem to love it so.... maybe it hassomething. Saxon is one of the best metal bandsof all time and it's still better than the [...]that was out at the time and out now! I recommendGreatest Hits Live before this for a collectionof their best and then you decide. rock on1
4,My Review 8,"Very good read. Would recommend to all my friends. It was written very well. Loved the plot, and no the hero and heroine."
5,an excellent film text,This text is an easy read. Imparts the necessary knowledge one needs to glean for an art of film class. The numerous examples make it simple for a student to apply the concepts described.
2,Not what I thought it would be,I had grammar rules doubts in my mind. This book explain the difference between similar words in Spanish.
5,Hands On!,I purchased this book as a gift and decided to buy one for myself. It is a great reference book for anyone interested in making their own tiles.
5,One of the best how-to books I've ever seen.,"This guy knows his stuff! Explains everything in plain English, provides lots of photos to assist you, and offers a variety of projects to inspire you. Hard to put it down!"
5,At Their Best,"Back in 1969 a friend at college turned me on to Deep Purple, and 'Book of Taliesyn' was the album. I was a budding bass player, and fell in love instantly. The songs range from good to great, and their cover of Neil Diamond's 'Kentucky Woman' is as perfect as rock and roll gets. In the late '70s it was common for a fan to ask another ""Ian Gillan or David Coverdale""? My answer was always ""Rod Evans!""For me this will always be the best Deep Purple lineup, but of course that's because it was my introduction to the band and my favorite songs they ever made, and your first is always the one you remember.Bottom line: you can do worse than to own this album, especially this version with good mastering and bonus tracks."
2,"Flimsy, dangerous for toddlers","The part that slides out and holds the keyboard has metal corners just at the right height for my kids to whack their heads accidentally as they pass by (eta or when they come up to me and practice their newfound jumping skills, as my daughter did 5 minutes ago). And the tray also falls off regularly. I gave two stars simply because it is made of real wood. But other than that, it's a pile of fail. I'll have to put some double-sided tape on it covered with plain to make it safer."
3,he didn't read the music very carefully...,"A lot of this CD is very impressive- Vengerov clearly has his technique under control, and the Paganini is very well-executed, making it sound easy.I feel that he's pretty far off the mark with the Messiaen, though. He must not have spent very much time learning this piece, since both the Theme (of the ""Theme et variations) and the final section of the piece are played at exactly twice the printed tempo! This completely changes the character of the piece to something that's very different from the meditative quality that the correct tempo markings imply. There are also a few wrong notes- small details, but it does make a difference, considering the emphasis Messiaen placed on harmony. There's a very good Naxos recording of this piece (with the Amici ensemble, Scott St. John, violin) that's worth hearing."
2,Disappointing,"TV hype is misleading-its not worth the money for following reasons:1. If you have to go to multiple stores to buy a half dozen ingredients for 1 spray, it will occur to you to just buy 1 spray. Isn't it like buying 5 batteries to recharge one?2 He spends a lot of pages telling you why he loves various pests rather than how you rid yourself of them. I got it for frogs. Nothing on that but a lot about why toads are good.3.Rid yourself of ants by leaving tainted cat food in the bushes. Hmm. Isn't the reason you would have cat food that you have a cat?4. Some suggestions were downright hilarious- I live in Hawaii and have bamboo around every side of the premises. I guarantee that it does nothing to discourage mosquitoes howevermany dragonflies may like the bamboo. And the notion crows may be deterred by socks that look like humans? In fairness, I did not climb trees to hang them because I would hear crows laughing."
4,great info but ingredients hard to find,Although some items listed in book are hard to find.Info. in book worked for me. I got rid of flies.
2,Miki Theodoraki ZORBA Sopundtrack,"I have searched for this music for a long time and finally bought this CD despite the exorbitant price. In my opinion, the value is poor; this is clearly a copy off an LP. The spirit of the film is missing without the voices of Allan Bates and Anthony Quinn preceding ZORBA'S DANCE: ""Teach me to dance."" ""Dance? Did you say dance?"" And yet, I love this music, all twenty-five minutes of it."
1,Toaster Oven-Danger model 6868b,"Danger! This is a REALLY cheap toaster, with the potential to be downright dangerous. The sides and tops get very hot (too hot to touch), which means anything touching it may catch fire. It also doesn't shut off when the door is opened (most other models do this). Toast settings are tough to fine-tune (light vs dark is a fraction of an inch). No temp setting for bake, just ""bake"". I'm surprised this is still sold.Model 6868B ""HomeCookin"" by WeatherWorks."
5,Soundtracking my senior year of high school,"I was turned on to The Get Up Kids the summer before my senior year of high school, 1998 to be precise. Now, I'm not too crazy about this remastered version but it's all you can find these days. This is a more abrasive GUK sound and not at all like the past two albums. The sound of every high school break up is the basis of this album. At least it's what I imagined a high school break up sounding like. I avoided relationships in high school as they are generally quite silly. But this album is berry berry fine. And I've met some damn cute girls who rock out to this. There you go guys. You have an in."
4,Olay Vitamins Ultra coQ10,"I like this product, I bought it before in local drugstores. I believe it has helped my facial skin by making it less dry, especially in the winter. The fact that it is a softgel, makes me believe that the COQ10 does gets into my bloodstream."
1,HORRIBLE,IT BROKE STOPED READING DISCS IT WAS REALLY SKETCHYDONT BUY IT EVER BUY PANISONIS (LS50) ITS MY NEW ONE AND IS GREATi bought this dvd player and used it preety rarely for about a year
2,A little disapointing,"Earl Palmer IS a great drummer, probably one of the most recorded ever. A true creator that shaped the way we all listen to drums and popular music these days. Unfortunately this book doesn't get very deep into the music aspect of his life, but like many other biographies, talks about a lot of other subjects. Don't get me wrong, it is a very interesting book. Especially on the subject of racial discrimination in the U.S. The way New Orleans is described is great. I was expecting something more on the musician side than on the personal side. That might be what you're looking for."
4,Great Book.,"Started and finished this today. Not a hugely long read but really entertaining. In one way Earl had a really hard life but it was also extremely interesting. Such a shame that you can't zip on to you tube and see very many performances like you can with a lot of the other guys from the 50's and 60's. The studio guys were really heard, but not seen.Anyway, heartily recommended to drummers and people interested in music history. RIP Earl and thanks for the music!"
2,Not Recommended,"Fans of Earl Palmer, the great drummer who played on Fats Domino's records (and innumerable others), will jump at the chance to learn more about his life and musical development; however, this book does not communicate much of interest. There are lots of anecdotes regarding generally unknown New Orleans characters. The stories most readers want to hear, stories about musicians we may have heard of, are underrepresented. In addition, there is very little discussion of music in general. Disappointing, since musicians are going to be the main audience for this work."
1,NASCAR XBOX,PURCHASED IN ERROR DID NOT REALIZE WOULD NOT WORK W/ XBOX 360 AND COMPANY REFUSED TO TAKE BACK BECAUSE I OPENED IT - EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED AND WASTED MONEY I DID NOT HAVE TO MAKE MY SON HAPPY AND THEN WHEN IT WOULD NOT WORK - NO EXCHANGE NOTHING AT ALL ; ( BOOOOOO...
3,No 4 player ? EA has really dropped the ball on this one.,"Every Saturday me and some friends get together to play a season of Nascar 2004 (we race the track that is featured that week). I rushed out yesterday, so juiced on getting 2004 with all the new features it added. When I got it home I was shocked to find on the back of the case the words (1 to 2 players), what in the heck happen to 4 players ? What ticked me off worse is not one review with the game designers or even the reviewers mention that it wouldn't be in this version. The game is great, don't get me wrong, the things they added really do move the game in a good direction and makes it feel like being in NASCAR race. Just sad that with all the improvements EA has made they have really screwed the XBOX owners by taking out 4 players ( I heard you can stil play 4 players on the PS2). Next time you omit something that big EA, Don't !!"
3,A truly inspiring book...,"This book demonstrates the accuracy of the public image of lawyers, that they are liars and hypocrites. Too bad the premise of this book is based (once again) on a lie. But, I guess it depends on what the definition of ""is"" is, right?If you buy this book, you're a stupid, mind-numbed robot, who'll get on your knees for the democRAT party.Save your money. Or, if you MUST buy something... Buy a bible!"
1,DON'T GET YOUR HOPES UP!,"Yesterday I bought a CLEAR BLUE EASY DIGITAL Pregnancy Test. I took the test and got a ""not pregnant"" result... BUT when I removed the test stick I saw TWO lines (one being very faint). I called the 800 number and talked to a rep. who told me that it was a positive result. She assured me that only the presence of HCG hormone could cause that little blue line to even show up. I took the other test in the pack but the digital part didn't even work this time. I again pulled the test stick out and saw TWO lines. Later that night and with first morning urine I used FIRST RESPONSE tests and both of those were negative.?? I was so confused that I went for a blood test in the morning and found out I was not pregnant! FIRST RESPONSE was right...CLEAR BLUE EASY DIGITAL was very confusing and false positive. Don't use CLEAR BLUE EASY DIGITAL it's a waste of money and time!"
4,Easy & Simple NO confusion,"Pregnant not pregnant, it can't be more clear. I'm not fond of the ones with the lines that sometimes read strangely or faintly or make you guess so you have to retake it. I was not however impressed with the way amazon shipped the item free or not. It was crushed and it would make me think twice about purchasing here on amazon even though I do purchase a good amount of items on here."
5,BFP!,"when it's time to POAS (pee on a stick), it's nice to have 3 tests in case you don't really believe your eyes.... these work. easy to read. what else can you ask from a pregnancy test? :)"
1,Another False Positive,"Add me to the long list of false positives. Took one in the morning and got a clear ""pregnant"" took 4 other non digitals, all very negative. I'm 15DPO and not pregnant."
5,Winter Love,"I read this book a long time ago. love it. my very first book that i read from Norah Hess. she did not disappoint, the way the story played out. give me the incentive to get to the end faster."
2,Her usual fluff piece,"Lots of bickering between the main characters. Silly misunderstandings that had potential, but just made you frustrated and impatient. Lots of conflict in the story that miraculously were resolved on the last 2 pages. Gimme a break!"
4,Pretty design! Very sharp!,"Very pretty pair of shoes, I loove the leather weave design!I bought the dark brown pair, the colour is darker than the photo shown here. I do like it darker, so it suits me just fine.The shoes are not so comfortable to walk in, the leather is a little hard.Cuts my feet at the back as well as in front. Feels a teeny bit smaller than my usual size 6.5. Haven't attempted to wear it out yet, waiting for an occasion which doesn't require much walking.Still like it a lot, just hope that it is built a little more comfy!"
3,"Works, but annoys","It seems that every time I grind pepper, the screw on top that you are supposed to adjust the coarseness with comes unscrewed. At first, I thought it was a defect, but I also got a salt grinder of the same kind, and it does the same thing, albeit to a lesser degree.Looks good, works, but is annoying as you have to keep readjusting the screw every 3-4 turns. Not something I expected from such an expensive and talked about product."
4,very graphic,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked up Travesti. All I knew was that I would be in for a treat just by looking at the cover. Kulick who is an anthropologist who studied the lives transvestites in Brazil as he became friends with them he got all of the inside scoop and included it in his book. He talks about the travestis that come from Italy to do business in Brazil where these things are more acceptable. Some of the people he interviews talk about how they started in the business, they talk about the ups and downs of their jobs. I found some of the stories to be very graphic. The lives of these men are sometimes beyond their choice of living. Some of them believe they were born into it. The stories are very realistic and in some cases tragic. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone whose clsed minded. However if you find it initeresting to read about the harsh realities of the world then this is the book for you."
2,Philosophized and minutia-exam screaming for condensation,"If never visited Brazil, the book projects the culture as high on the bizarre-scale in general, as it delves laboriously into the lives and physical-augmentation practices of transgendered sex-workers. Although on the surface enlightening, it could have taken fewer trees to produce the same somewhat go-nowhere-conclusions, and I found myself more willing to seek out volumes and sources used by the author as references into the study of trans-persons of various stripes. It appeared that the author was too overly imbued with his own gay (and possibly trans-) proclivities for this to serve as an objective sociological study. Perhaps he should write a ""sensational"" script for the screen. It could be done with minor revisions of the text-format, although I did appreciate his manipulation of phaseology."
5,Your batteries will love this charger,Just read the easy to understand manual once and connect it up to your batteries; they will be charged up in no time flat!
3,Do not use in permanent trickle charge mode!,"First, let me say that this charger performs flawlessly and deserves five stars when it is in charging mode. I have used it for three years and hundreds of successful charging cycles on a dozen different batteries of various sizes and types.However, on two different occasions and with two different batteries (both brand new when hooked to the charger) I left them in ""trickle charge"" mode. The batteries were part of an emergency communications station that must to be ready at any time with full batteries. This charger burned up both batteries after three months of trickle charging. This mode is supposed to allow a battery to be hooked up indefinitely and maintain it at peak performance. Not destroy it. Other folks in the emergency communications service use other chargers and leave them in trickle mode for years. DO NOT use this charger for that kind of operation."
3,"SSC-1000A Batt charge OK, But",Purchased this charger to use on a Marine Deep Cell for my CB radio AMP-BUT you WILLget a AC humm type noise thru the speaker and when you shut it off the noise goes away and the meter drops about 2 DB. Not sure if it is the Charger Unit or the Cooling fan that is causing the noise. Beware if you are going to use this on any Radio Equip.
2,NOT Automatic! Be careful!,Do not leave this unit switched on and hanged on battery!- UNIT NEVER SWITCHES OFF AUTOMATICALLY - IT CANNOT DETERMINE WHEN BATTERY IS CHARGED! ENDLESS CHARGING!....- NEVER SEEN IN BATTERY TESTING or DESULFATING MODE - seems unit doesn't use this AT ALL.I've been using this device for about 3 years.
4,Easy To Control,"This charger is as easy to use as the other reviews have stated, and I would recommend the item to a friend. My only very minor disappointment is with the 2 amp charging mode. It cannot be used as a trickle charge. Nevertheless, it's a good product."
2,Leaked all over thought product is okay:,"The seal on the cap was opened and much of the product leaked out during shipping. Would not buy from seller again. The scent is strong and smells just like rosemary. When used with the burner, it creates a nice scent throughout the home. It burns quickly and product is a bit expensive to keep having to refill burner."
3,You get what you pay for,"We bought this back in March of 07-- I know that because my Amazon account history alerted me to the fact that I have already purchased this item, prompting me for this review. Now it's March of 08 and the net has completely disintegrated, it tore right off the hoop from just a few shots. I guess it got weak from winter weather. So be warned that this is not an all-weather item. But nonetheless I give it 3 stars because you can't beat the price-- you get what you pay for, which in this case is a one-year net."
4,More Earl Taylor!,This is a solid bluegrass disk with great banjo pickin' and soulful vocals. Its 'ol timey charm is great in the workshop or out on the lawn. I only wish more of the old Earl Taylor vinyl would be released to disk (especially Folksongs From The Bluegrass).
3,It came dirty!,I understood that this was a used product at the time of purchase. I didn't expect to receive something with stains and gunk all over it. I had to thoroughly clean the entire controller before using it. One of the trigger buttons is rather sticky and doesn't quite work properly.
3,nice but not what I was hoping for,"I am a big fan of the show, and hoped to hear more of the electronic soundscapes from the show, however, this album is filled with 3 to 5 minute songs without words."
3,Good movie,"first noticed the shave-less bloke so vouched by the youngsters in the eighties in this film and from here i have been a Anil Kapoor fan.A very smooth and rollicking comedy-thriller with a good plausible story.Jackie schroff is superbly teamed with Kapoor and the chemistry works wonders.Probably a take-off of a Hollywood movie as the main theme is foreign.Especially Kapoor's lust for the opposite sex!The direction,outdoor shooting and script are good.Music is average for 1984.Subsequent pairing of Schroff and Kapoor reaped well and it is sad we have not seen the two again now in their middle age.An enjoyable and amusing film for the escapist."
1,May have been good,"These condoms are hard to put on. It is ultra thin, so I think if he would have been able to get it on, it would have been an enjoyable product. My guy is average size, so he should have been able to the condom on, but after 10 minutes of trying we just used another brand. It makes no sense to have to go through all of that to put a condom on."
1,Very hard to put on,I bought these condoms not too long ago and to my dismay it was incredibly tight on me and nearly impossible for me to put on. I wouldn't recommend these for anyone that is above average in girth.
2,Not worth it.,"It does have some power, but not quite enough, maybe lower than 220 ft-lbs.A 18"" or 24"" breaker bar is better than this."
4,Electric Impact Wrench,"This item is very good. Has plenty of power to remove lug nuts on cars and trucks. Also I will be using it to disassemble engines. For the price, weight and power I don't think you can beat it."
4,For Everything a Season,"This is an excellent book, as are all of Philip Gulley's. They are ""feel good"" books, and I enjoy them all. Although this particular book is not a story evolving around the local townspeople, as are many of his, it is still an inspiring read. I hope Mr. Gulley continues to crank out his particular type of humor/inspiration for years to come!"
4,uplifting,All Gulley books are a dilight to read. Light and fun and so true and human. I enjoy all his books.
5,A Book that Cured my Homesickness!!!,"Right now I am in Evansville at college. Today I was in a bookstore and finally decided to buy this book. I'm from Danville, and have lived there all of my life. My whole family has lived here since my great-grandparents moved here LONG ago. After reading ""For Everything A Season,"" I feel like I'm back in Danville again. I personally knew Adam (the boy from the chapter A Time to Heal: One September). This story made me cry. It happened almost two years ago. Other stories hit me personally. I have my memories from the Royal Theater, Blanton Woods, and flooded basements. If you are from a small town and want to reminisce, or from a big city and want to know what you're missing from small town living, this is the book for you. Mr. Gulley did a wonderful job. I have heard him speak before at a convention for Student Council, and he was wonderful. You'll love this book."
5,Kotler pulls off a beautiful ride,"When I saw the title of this book, I thought that Kotler was taking on too much. Surfing, Science, and the Origins of Belief? Quite a bit to chew on. But then again, Kotler has had a ton of life experience (he describes his recovery from Lime disease in this book), is really smart, and surprisingly, he ties it all together in this book with grace, wit, and some impressive prose. I really enjoyed it, notably his attempt to recreate (through a little-known surf myth) how religions and mythologies have probably formed throughout the ages. As Kotler travels about Indonesia, New Zealand and Hawaii, he drops endless interesting factoids, scientific and surf-related, especially the ones about Chinese weather control conspiracy theories (theories that sound scarily true). An outstanding read for a surf trip or just sitting home on a foggy day. I'm grateful to Kotler for helping inspire me to finish my surfing memoir,Saltwater Buddha: A Surfer's Quest to Find Zen on the Sea"
2,Formatting problem in the Kindle edition?,"I've just downloaded the free sample first few pages. I would like to buy this ebook, but I am put off by some problems in the formatting. It is not right and left justified (uneven right hand margin) and there are breaks in the middle of lines for no good reason. Does anybody else have this problem?"
4,intelligent and ambitious,"An ambitious attempt to capture and explain the intangibles that all surfers know by their experience in the water. Wonderful exploration of myth in the tradition of Joseph Campbell but far more accessible than some of J. Campbell's works. By his intelligent approach and his credibility as a surfer Kotler helps destroy , in part, the stereotype of the burnt-out, stoner Spicoli surfer and at the same time celebrates the free-spirited, fringe aspects of the surfer culture/ethnology."
3,"Some interesting surf tales, but falls short for me.","I guess I was expecting more surfing. To be fair, while I bought the book knowing it was about surfing and its relationship to spirituality, religion and mythology -- there wasn't really that much tying them together. It was more like a couple of ok personal surfing tales, and then a whole lot of citing various theories about spirituality, metaphysic, mythology and human evolution. Not that these weren't interesting, but they really only seemed to be tangentially related to the surfing parts. I think I just found the book to be lacking a certain amount of coherence.In his defense I'll say had I just finished reading ""Searching for Captian Zero"" before this, and that may have set the bar a little high."
3,A decent debut album,"The handful of original tracks (apart from ""Winter"", which is mercifully short) are quite good, and the reworkings are OK, although I don't like ""Salva Nos"" with the new singer. Yuki's English lyrics seem to be getting better, too. Not a bad effort by any means, but if you don't have them already I would spend some extra money and get one of her .hack//SIGN soundtracks instead."
3,Easy to Understand,"I am using this text for my economics course I am currently enrolled in. I find the book very easy to understand, and it explains everything in detail. I like to know that if I cannot understand the material the professor lectures about clearly, I can rely on the book to clarify."
5,Excelent book!,Gorgeous book! Amazing how she describes how it is to work with the famouse architects of the moment and the creatives solution that she provides to structure issues
5,Outstanding...,"I wanted to dislike Informal. I was frothing at the mouth ready to find fault with the book...up until I read it. And it was stellar. I'm actually kind of upset this isn't required reading in my architecture school.The ultimate benefit of reading Informal is in getting a glimpse into how Balmond thinks. Regardless of whether or not the end products were built, seeing how he thinks his way through problems makes you wish his overwhelming creativity would wash off on you. Balmond explores structure as a possibility rather than a limitation. He conceives highly imaginative and innovative solutions that work symbiotically with the architecture. His writes with humane prose and presents his ideas with inquisitive boyishness, in no way belying his erudition.Genius. Pure and simple. Worth every dime."
4,Prog metal at its finest,If you like opeth I don't see how you can't like this. Two sets plus a making of. This DVD has great sound.
1,Ditto: Seagate sucks,"I TOTALLY agree with Mr. Stewart. I had mine less than 2 months when it erased itself. My computer was unattended, so don't let Seagate give you that bull about data only gets corrupted if the drive is dropped, set on fire, in a flood or attacked by a virus. None of those events occurred, yet my system detected the external drive as corrupted! No anti-virus, Spin-Rite, not even Seagate's own File Recovery Software could detect media on the drive. Which brings to mind that any company that has a VERY expensive full Data Recovery Service on their website that ONLY recovers data from their own products, or ""kindly"" offers software that costs a whopping $129.00 if you want to do it yourself, KNOWS its drives are unreliable. 'nuf said.Seagate: Stick it to yourself, please, not the consumer. And to think the ST300-RK came so highly recommended. I was linked to Seagate's website by none other than Consumer Reports. Yeah, like THEY'VE got no affiliate programs."
1,Same frustration...,"I've had my SG300 for 3 years now, and it inexplicably stops on its own (you can hear an internal shutoff click) and, ultimately, freezes, and all data is lost. It failed from the first time used. If I attend to it by not letting any time lapse, I'm ok, but that's hardly reliable! I've initialized countless times over the years. I'm on a Mac. The software that came with it was for a PC. In case it's my mistake (not knowing how to use it) I've talked to countless people (PC/Mac) and researched on the web and no one has a solution, but I AM reading about similar complaints. I use it ONLY as my secondary backup, which I keep offsite. My firewire LaCie Porsche, on the other hand, works flawlessly! I don't take this SG seriously."
2,Nice looking - bad cooking,"I bought this toaster on Amazon and it worked ok, although the toasting was somewhat uneven, but acceptable. After about a year, the toaster stopped ejecting the toast automatically and we ended up with a house full of smoke from burnt toast. I opened the toaster up and found that the R3 resistor on the toaster's circuit board had failed. I have read that many other customers had this same experience with their 6330 and 6329 toasters, so I sent an email to Oster's customer support asking for a replacement circuit board. Hopefully they will choose a new value for the R3 resistor, too. If enough customers send emails to Oster perhaps they will give us free repairs.12/19/2008 Update to my review: I complained to Oster and got a replacement toaster from them in 2007. I have had it for a year now and it is still working..."
1,Poor Quality,Ended up returning this item after too many wasted pieces of burnt bread. Even on the lowest setting this toaster toasted unevenly and way too dark on one side. Will look for another more reliable brand.
3,item never received,"I got an email confirming the item had been returned, but the strange part is it was never received by me & I actually had wanted this DVD!"
4,Great buy,Excellent product. Easy to install. Only downside is that you cannot downgrade Rome Total War (it's the only one I've installed). Rome is automatically updated to 1.5
1,Ugh! Disappointing,"I had to chime in after seeing all the raves on this. This is the first and last Bruce CD I bought. A huge Maiden fan, I was really disappointed when this album came out. I can barely describe how bad I thought it was...I was actually embarrased for the man.If you are like me and the other reviewer who trashed this in your Maiden tastes (ie you thought they were great up through 7th son and then...well, that was the end of maiden as far as you were concerned), steer far clear from this coaster."
4,A primer on developing a closer relationship with God.,In this very readable book Ben Johnson discusses the ubiquitiy of spiritual questing. He offers techniques to explore the role of God in our lives and ways to become closer to God. I recommend this for the person who is just starting a quest or those that are already on a spiritual journey who would like to deepen their relationship with God.
2,"Poor transfers, and incomplete","The 1936 Bayreuth recordings were made in the Festspielhaus, and in places are quite muddy. But not this muddy (if in doubt it is quite easy to find transfers of these out-of-copyright recordings on various blogs). Furthermore one side (the second of the original set - ""Gesegnet sollst du schreiten"") is, for some unaccountable reason, missing. So best look to Archipel (which is also flawed) or the bloggosphere."
1,Useless without an Answer Key,"I called and wrote many people at the publisher and even ordered a copy from them to show them I was serious, but they would not sell me a copy unless I was a teacher. Despite the detailed content of the book, I must ultimately give it a bad rating as the price can't be justified when you can't verify your answers."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE it! VERY helpful for Artic sessions,"This book, is by far the BEST book for helping you explain to your client how to form the sound you are targeting. And, if that doesn't work, there are many more suggestions for shaping that same sound from other already acquired sounds. This book should be a mandatory book for both those in school and in practice. Love, love, love it! It really does work, I've tried his suggestions for the hard sounds to shape such as the ""sh"" on some clients with great, almost instant success! This is the book to get, look no further."
1,"Same old, same old","Having watched Dr. Daniels on CPAN, I don't need to read his tales from the slums. It's the same old right wing litany: all evils are the result of liberal intellectuals. Nothing is ever the fault of the crass commercialization of sex to sell junk people don't need; the underemployment and underpayment people so a handful of the ""ambitious"" can get rich at everyone else's expense; the use of religion to cultivate a culture of self-loathing that assists the clerical class in holding sway over the pews. No, nothing is ever the fault of the lies and hypocrisies and slanders of those sectarian neo-fascist statists who claim (incorrectly) to be ""conservatives."""
2,Interesting stories from a professional cynic...,"Whilst interesting, this book does little more than repeat the tired commandment of the political right - personal responsibility over structural failure. The fanboyism of reviews should be enough to make a prospective reader wary. Best taken with a pinch of salt, and perhaps a hint of optimism."
1,I hate it,I would recomend this product to no one. It works only 10 percent of the time and can not be relied on
4,Pretty good pop punk album,My sister thought it was just some wanna-be Blink 182 band. What does she know?? Definitely has a 'poppy' sound to it.
4,Good track,really good track from a very Talented Singer&Songwriter.George Michael when he is focused is a Solid Writer&Vocalist&material like this Highlights His Talent.
5,Very Luminous Muddling,"The new Easton Studio Press edition of this classic book by Warren Johnson is based on the cogent original ""fruitful use"" meaning of the word frugality more than its current thriftiness connotations. That humanity is muddling at best, and failing at worst, to achieve long-term fruitful use of our planetary resources is clear, and this text is both an idealistic and pragmatic way of understanding the sustainability crisis we face. It will take many strategies such as this to inspire the mainstream to seek ""the satisfaction of enough"" when, by definition, more is not enough in consumer society. Perhaps it helps to remember that whether postconsumers decide to find satisfaction with a little or a lot, consumers can never get satisfied at all."
2,not what I expected,"I was buying this to replace an old one, but the train gets stuck 4-5 times on track so it's not much fun for a kid. FYI"
2,"poorly organized, defensively written","I bought this book based on the number of favorable reviews and was disappointed. Poehlmann's tone is defensive, and the book offers more rhetoric than useful information. This is a fine book for those who are already convinced of the mycoplasma theory and the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy, but it for those who are seeking more information, it falls flat, chiefly because it fails to offer a cogent, rational uninflected basis for its views."
5,Great Classroom Video,I am a computer lab teacher for grades k-5th. This is a great video to introduce the concepts of inventions and how things work.
4,Good Sophomore Release,"This is BG' second album. It's really a pretty good album. But if you're use to the BG from ""Imaginations from the Other Side"" then you might be a little surprised. This album is more thrashy than their later releases but BG still shows their great musicianship. The songs kick ass too. If you're a BG fan then this is a good CD to get to complete your collection."
4,"great stand, wish it has a page holder","this is a very sturdy stand and looks great in our living room. I just wish it had a page holder (our previous cheap portable standard had one). It works great for sheet music. but for a book, we have to put a paper clip on to keep the pages from turning. overall an excellent value for this product. I am sure it will last much longer than our previous portable stand."
4,Partly plastic,"The stand works well for my purposes, but I was disappointed to discover that it contains a plastic part. Similar Manhasset stands that I own are all-metal. In this one, at the base of the music holder, the socket into which you insert the post is made of plastic.I worry that this plastic piece might break if the stand tips over and hits the floor hard. So far, I've had no problems."
5,Very sturdy music stand,I bought the Manhasset M48 Symphony Music Stand for my daughter who plays the violin. This stand is very sturdy and well built. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a well-made music stand at a reasonable price.
5,Durable stand but no instruction manual,"This stand came and was pretty easy to put together. There was no instruction manual that came with it however but its pretty intuitive and you should be able to figure it out pretty easily. If not, just go watch a youtube video or something."
5,Very sturdy stand!,Love this stand....so glad to have one at home! It came almost the next day and was easy to assemble
1,arrgh,"why the hell all of these stands I've used out gigging on ships, clubs, my music college, recital halls have the ones with the all metal construction and I got the one with the PLASTIC BALL JOINT???? WHY???"
3,tipsy!,"No assembly instructions came with this- really?!? -- so I tried it myself - and I am NOT good at this sort of thing. Only after I got it assembled did it occur to me to go on line, where indeed I found directions. Problem: I can't get it adjusted so that it doesn't flip over at the slightest touch, dumping my music on the floor. Not the whole stand, just the part that holds the music. Maybe if I had a ratchet, whatever that is? I do have a set of wrenches, but it's not possible to tighten the nuts that might hold the stand steady. I've also had to tighten the base once in the month or so that I've had this. Overall -- disappointing.Update: I took the stand into my local music store, where -- though I hadn't bought it there -- they kindly fixed the problem for me, using a tool that I didn't own. So now it's perfectly stable, and I'm upgrading to three stars -- not five because they really should include a page of instructions."
5,Nice and sturdy,Good product for the price. We got this to use with a drum machine on stage and it's perfect. We just velcro it on to make sure it's stable
5,Christmas present,This was a Christmas present. He was very happy with it. It arrived in great time and was well packaged.
5,"Well made, well priced.","I bought this stand to fulfill a hair-brained idea: as a stand for a flat-screen TV.Unfortunately, the TV I ordered at the same time has an antenna connection in the back of the TV.Back to square one.This is an excellent music stand, however.I've never had any problem with grease leaking out the bottom."
3,Not worth buying on its own,"This is good reading when preceded by the first three Zuckerman books. If you can find Zuckerman Bound, buy that, and get this baby included in the collection. That work, with 3 novels and this novella, is one of the best books Ive read."
3,For Devoted Fans....,"Many of the reviews of this piece are especially harsh. This shouldn't be considered a stand-alone novel. (It's little more than a short story, really.) It is just another episode in the ongoing saga of Nathan Zuckerman.This story is taken from the journals of Nathan Zuckerman. He goes to communist Prague in order to retrieve some Yiddish short stories. That's about all there is to it. Contrary to the title, there's not even an orgy involved.So, for Roth (and Zuckerman) fans - yes, you should read it. Yet, even the most ardent admirer will find Harold Bloom's glowing blurb to be a bit of an overstatement."
1,"contains milk, from china",I threw them all out.They contain milk products and were manufactured in China.
1,choking hazard for little ones,"I've been looking at all the local grocery stores for teething biscuits for my 7 month old daughter. When I didn't find any there, I ordered a case of these. Unfortunately it's a total waste of money. I tried giving them to my daughter twice and both times she instantly broke off a piece that was perfect choking size. They're too easily broken to be good gnawing biscuits, and don't melt in the mouth fast enough to overcome that problem. It's back to the drawing board for me while whole boxes of these sit unused. For what it's worth, they're also really bland flavored."
1,Made in China!!!,I bought these on the recommendation of a friend who's baby loves them only to discover once they arrived that they're made in China. Not something I'm willing to feed my baby.
1,Made in CHINA!,"I'll buy clothing and electronics if it's made in China, but NO WAY I'll food - it's just too risky. Even some of the middle class there have started their own farming because they know they can't trust the government to regulate food safety... So, I'm hugely disappointed to learn that about these especially since I love how my little one is happy to be able to hold the cracker by herself. Won't be buying any more of these!"
5,Barney's New Car,"This is a great movie about how to get around in a car. It helps your child use his or her imagination as Barney goes to the car wash, the cleaners, the library, and Shawn's Snappy Snacks. In the beginning of the video, the children get an idea to make Barney a car. Shawn makes license plates that say ""Barney"" and ""I Love You"". Kathy makes a litter bag for Barney so he can put his trash in it. While Shawn and Kathy make equipment for Barney's car, Min and Carlos make the car out on the playground. Go to fun places outside of the house with your child and they'll use their imagination as you run errands or take them places in your car."
3,Overall a useful anthology,"Dov Peretz Elkins has gifted the Jewish world with many useful publications, for which we ought to be grateful. While this anthology has much that is meaningful, moving or scholarly, many of the selections strike me as filler. For those who have both the Yom Kippur and the Rosh Hashanah volumes, you will notice that much material is recycled. There are also prayers and sections of the services for which coverage is scanty or missing. Despite these defects, I am happy to have these books on my shelves and am sure that they will enrich the holidays for many as they have for me. Thank you Dov!"
3,does the job,If you have a DSLR from olympus the only button that works with this remote is the picture button. Which is the most important one of course. It's worth buying to avoid camera shake while using a tripod.
4,Natures Path ECO PACK (26.4oz) Honey'd Corn Flakes,Nature's Path Honey' Corn Flakes...GLUTEN FREE....are as my husband with Celiac (Allergic to Gluten) says.... the next best thing to real people's Regular Kello--s Corn Flakes. It is hard to get something tasty BUT to him this item does the trick....Recommend highly for people with Celiac and other allergies.
4,A Life Wasted,"The Duke of Deception is the sad story of a wasted life. Whether visible through this book or through This Boy's Life, Duke Wolff lived a life without focus. Unfortunately, the impact of such a man on the people around him is negative. Both boys and their mother suffered immeasurably, and the suffering is visible here. This book--more a confessional than a memoir--is at times touching, irritating, and embarrassing. I am merely grateful that both of the boys have succeeded as well as they have.The prose is serviceable, rarely inspiring.This is meant to be inspirational, I believe, but it is quite depressing at times. Duke reminded me of the worst parts of Willy Loman."
3,"""Crinkly"" sound","The mat has a crinkly inner core, like in a crinkly sounding cat toy, so may cats think it is a toy, along with the fact that the mat has a loop on one edge (you can see it in one of the customer uploaded photos), so they *really* think it is a toy. Still, they do like to sit on it, so we're keeping it. But, I'm taking it out of my bedroom, which is where I purchased it for, since the crinkling is loud enough to wake me up (I'm a semi-light sleeper). The crinkling not mentioned in the product description is why I give this just a 3-stars rating. I'll be purchasing fleece and making my own mats now."
3,A little bit small,"The product was a bit small for my cat. The cat they use in the picture must be 5 or 6 lbs at most. I have a 16 lb cat who is taller and longer than my dogs and he cannot even curl up on this mat. It also makes a very annoying 'scrunch' sound as though it were filled with beads. I gave it to a friend a couple of days after I bought it. Smaller cats would love it because it definitely would help them with self-heating, but if you have a larger-than-normal cat, forgo this entirely and seek out a thermal dog pad instead."
3,They won't use it,"I have nine cats and I take care of a feral cat I had fixed. He lives on my porch on the swing and it's winter now, so I bought two of these. He seems to really like his but I had to put it under the blanket as he was wary of it. It seems to keep him happier than when he just had the blankets. But my other cats won't use the second one. They just don't like it. Only one time have I ever seen them lying on it. I tried putting it underneath a blanket on the couch and they still laid everywhere but on it. Maybe they're just ornery. I didn't send it back because I figure there will always be other stray cats to use it for. It wasn't very expensive."
3,Pretty good but not what it looked like online.,"The cat loved it immediately. Unbeknownst to us, the ""insulation"" is a sheet of crinkly plastic. There is very little padding to this which was kinda the point of getting it. We wanted to insulated our cat from not only the cold floor but also the hardness of the floor.Unfortunately, when we moved the mat from the office where she first seen and loved it to where her bed is, she freaked out and my wife almost had to go to the emergency room to get stitches. Our cat likes playing with plastic. But I think the fact that it is concealed between the layers of this mat really threw her off. Looks like a comfy mat but sounds like a pile of plastic bags. I guess I might be freaked out if I was a cat too."
4,Bad Monkey...,"Well, two months later the cats love this mat, especially Monkey. Now I just need to buy 3 more to stop the fighting over the oneI bought this for my 13 year old cat, Monkey. To say that he doesn't like it is an understatement. First he didn't like it because it makes a crinkling sound. My three other cats wouldn't go near it for the same reason. Then Monkey to show his obvious disdain, peed on it. I washed it, trying to entice one of them with cat nip. None of them would go near it except for Monkey with the same results.Back to the drawing board. Had I known it made a crinkling sound, I wouldn't have bought it the first place."
1,Does not warm,I would not buy this product again. My cat will lay on it for an extended time and yet it is still cool to the touch. Should have bought something else.
4,"Nice mats, but they slide around on tile","Bought 2 of these. Cats like them, they lay on them in front of the patio door so they can look out. I think they would work better on carpet. They slide around on the tile and I'm always chasing them out from under the table to put them back in place."
4,The furballs love it,"What can I say, the cats love to curl up on this thing, and that's what counts. A bit bigger for my 2 big guys would be good, so they should consider offering this in multiple sizes, other than that, there's not much else to say."
4,comfy cozy!,My kitties are very happy to have this to lounge out on! Just what we all wanted to keep them happy and purring
2,Costs more than advertised,"My daughter loved this authentic-sounding bird until the batteries died, and alas, the mockingbird would not sing. Due to a verbal contract I had entered into with my dear sweet child, I was sent into a debt-spiral of purchasing progressively expensive and inexplicably shoddy products."
4,Bought them all,"Have the whole series, got hooked on the first one & had to read the rest. My husband & my son also got hooked ;-)"
4,Bones of my family.,"I got this book a few years ago, and was ready to Hate it, but after reading i think all should read it. I am one who see's RED when I think of all the bones of First Americans in places of, saposafly, Higher Learing! BUT what would happen if we were to dig up Your Great Grandfolks! Study, but then GIVE THEM B A C K ! ! !"
1,"poor research, poor facts","The biases in this book are obvious. I wonder if the writer has ever set foot in a Mormon church, and sat through all three hours of meetings and services. He claims to know about the Mormon church, but has he investigated the original sources. Does he claim to have been in a Mormon temple? No, most of his ""facts"" are hearsay and rumors. If the writer has a point to make about religion, please tell me your beliefs; tell me why your beliefs are correct. Attacking others does nothing to inform people about the correctness of your beliefs."
3,Great Game Fatally Flawed,"I am a huge fan of the Total War series and could not wait for Medieval II to come out. I purchased it and loaded it onto my brand new Core2Duo machine that has a ton of resources (512 mb geforce, 2 gig SD-DDR Ram, core2duo proc etc)and guess what? IT WON'T RUN! And better yet, there is no support from Sega and their recommended help links offer useless patches. I'm not just blowing smoke either. While trying (again & again & again) to get it running I found several sites that have hundreds of the same complaints. I WASTED my money on an unsupported game that doesn't run on a brand new Intel chip set. I am hugely disappointed in Medeival II. I feel Sega quite simply ripped me off. THANKS FOR NOTHING SEGA!"
1,Don't buy this game yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"When my friend told me about this game I got all excited and went onto Amazon to buy it. I got it today and I put the disk in my computer and it told me to get Medieval 2 Total War too use this. I am truly upset because I used my money and bought this game not knowing anything about what "" expansion pack"" means. Amazon did not tell anyone on this sight about needing the first version. So to finish this report, make sure that you buy or have the the first version to us it."
5,Four in a row for The Creative Assembly!,"I myself am a 15 year old history buff and military strategist. I have been a devoted fan of total war since I first played Rome (another game I highly recommend) at 10 years of age. I saw Medieval II Total War here on Amazon and bought it for a steal. I was enthralled when I installed the game, turned the graphics settings to their lowest, and was able to field thousands of individually rendered and animated soldiers. Even on lowest, the graphics are excellent. Also, there were next to no factual errors, not to mention that the game itself was remarkable. This stroke of genius known as Medieval II Total War has earned five stars from me."
2,Took a good idea and didn't execute well enough,"I originally enjoyed the title series MTW, and mildly enjoyed RTW. I was very excited about this release and bought it first order on November 16th when it was released. The game has more than a few problems and feels as if it was not tested well. Though it functions, it is not very exciting to play, it feels more like a chore.I would write a better review, but you can get them at many other sites. I can only say that I wished I had waited 6 months to buy this game after they worked out the kinks and lowered the price. Unfortunately, I did not, so I can only rate this game having played it out of the box."
5,Amazing Game,"SO awesme, play a King and lay waste to your enemies! Stunning graphics, excellent game style and learning curve. If you dig strategy and tactics this is your game"
4,Indirect fire,I bought Medieval 2 recently because I was a huge fan of Rome Total war. This game is one of the best strategy games I have played. Your unit choices for all factions are diverse. The battles are mostly enjoyable.The only flaws I have seen have been with the cavalry units and artillery.When you have selected your cavalry to attack an enemy unit often the cavalry will charge but stop short of the enemies. This gets very annoying when trying to chase down fleeing armies. The other annoyance is artillery attacks. Your artillery is devastating to the enemy....when it actually hits the target. I was attacking a large army with my artillery. Out of 24 shots my artillery fired they only hit the enemy once. My favorite unit types aren't so useful in this game. Other than that it is a good game. I would still recommend it.
1,"Errors, errors and more errors","I have had errors on installing, errors on playing the campian maps and errors in battle maps. I have installed the ""patches"" and have the expansion pack as well...this game could have been great. I have spent a total of 20 hrs tying to fix it and it is is buggy and unplayable for any length of time. After installing new chip set drivers, new grafix card drivers and new sound card drivers, I am still 50 dollars poorer and pissed off. Do yourself a favor and dont bother buying this game. I have a top of the line gaming cpu btw...I wish I could rate it lower than one star..."
1,Don't buy it!,"Short review. It doesn't work; don't buy it. Although I have more than the necessary system requiements, the game freezes up as it's opening. It can't be minimized and you really have to struggle to regain control of your computer. Apparently online there are patches and/or drivers that will fix the problem, but when I buy a new game I have a basic expectation that it will work. I guess it works for some people/computers, but it didn't for mine. I'm out $40."
1,Great - if you don't mind your child being exposed to pederasty,"I'm disgusted. The game apparently offers attribute points to agents or spies, for a catamite; for pederasty. I don't care if this ""was part of the ancient world"" - this is egregiously irresponsible of these makers to put this in. They've absolutely lost my trust, and any future business."
4,A underground black metal gem,"I had never heard of this band untill i recently stumbled upon them on amazon.I am a lover of various genere's of metal,from thrash to death and of course black metal.I decided to get this cd,and i have to tell you,i was not disappointed.This is just good old fashioned evil black metal,with a atmosphere of doom and depression and intense hate of all things good and wholesome!If you like this type of music,this cd is a must have!One thing,this cd is a little hard to find,chance's are you are'nt going to find it at your local mall's cd shop.Look for it on amazon."
5,Purchase from Amazon.com,"The product arrived in fine shape in a very short amount of time. I was well pleased with the service, as always."
1,ICTS the best test orep for IL Certification testubg system,"The book is terrible they offer only one prep test and it is the absolutely the same as ICTS offers for free!!! So, there are no additional problems to solve,no exercises, no drill tests, no quizzes so you can prepare yourself for the test. CD that attached is simply a copy of the book!!! I just wasted money on this book!!!"
5,This Cheese is Terrific!,This cheese is wonderful. It reminds of my youth in Lebanon Pa. Combine this with a piece of sweet bologna cut into a triangle of similar size and I'm in heaven!
2,"Bell Faction is a better commuting helmet, for less $","The Bell Metropolis sounded like the ideal commuting helmet: you can put on a rear-view mirror, a rain cover, and an LED taillight. In reality, none of these accessories came with the helmet, they are optional accessories. Then I saw that the mirror attaches to the visor, not to the helmet. No problem if you ride a recumbent or use upright handlebars, but with drop handlebars you can't use the visor (you can't see where you're going) and so you can't use the mirror.In contrast, Bell's Faction helmet is half the price and you can put a mirror on it. It has only a few small vents so you don't need a rain cover. In the winter I cover the vents with tape and fill them with foam. Plus the Faction comes down further on the back and sides of your head so it should be safer. And the shell is thicker."
5,Always and Forever Winnie the Pooh,"This is a wonderful colletion of all the tales of Winnie the Pooh....I have had a copy for more years than I care to disclose, but recently bought a copy for my secretary's new daughter....It is a classic and something all children should grow up with, even today!May Winnie the Pooh remain in your heart forever!"
5,First CD-studio production,"I've been a fan of Roger's since he played a local club almost two years ago. I own all of his CD's (he has 5 out, another soon to be released), and this was my fourth purchase--I'd bought later releases at his show. I had to have the entire collection; his guitar solos throughout Hurricane Blues always rock the house, and this production was done well. His ""get into it and get it on"" playing and singing has me listening to the CD over and over; enjoying a few original tunes he's included and old blues favorites. Guest artists add to the full production; an amazing first CD!"
5,GLUTEN FREE YUMMIES,My kids love these. It's nice to have a gluten free option for on-the-go snacking. These fit the bill nicely.
1,"It may be a good item, but my kids wouldn't eat it","I tried and tried, because, of course they are good for you. But alas, my children wouldn't eat them. From the 16 year old on down. I've tried them too, and they are a bit bland and hard. Can't really blame them, but how am I gonna get rid of these boxes??"
1,The Worst Book I Ever Read,WHAT A STUPID BOOK - WHAT A STUPID AUTHOR - This book goes beyond boring and straight into lame. The opinions expressed on film theory are so basic that it must have been written by a four year old with down syndrome. IF YOU BUY THIS BOOK YOU'LL REGRET IT!!!!
3,Short and to the point,"Edith is not a bad instructor. However, she fails to address an important issue during her demonstrations: Safety! Pole requires muscle conditioning and proper positioning in order to avoid serious injury. The most common injuries are to the shoulder joints and she has failed to compensate for this in her instruction. I would recommend this video to individuals who are at an intermediate pole level, not for beginners who need to learn pole safety first."
3,Try Black/Decker,Keep in mind this runs on batteries so those set in stains are going to kill this scrubber.Looking to save a buck then buy this but be warned.
2,Tastes a little cardboardy and does contain sugar,"I was looking for a good instant organic plain oatmeal and settled for this variety due to added flax seed. I was a little disappointed with the taste. To be fair, I missed the fact that this has added sugar but wanted to mention it so others don't overlook it. But, the oatmeal had an underlying aftertaste. It reminded me a bit of cardboard (not that I eat cardboard but it took on that smell). I usually buy Trader Joes boxed instant and the taste can't even compare to TJ's variety. Darn it. I liked the convenience and price."
2,Update: It broke!,"I've had this teapot for over two years now, and it's a great size. Large enough to share among my friends (which is what tea parties are for, no?). Only problem is a patch of unglazed area, but it's on the inside near the lid opening, so no one notices. Overall, excellent value for the price.Update: It's probably the third year, now, and the bottom broke! It oddly just... fell off, about a half inch up from the flat part, in a very clean circle. I will not be buying another, but it was all right for the three-ish years of use I got out of it. Between the breaking and the poor glazing, I will buy my next teapot from a brick-and-mortar shop in town so I can heft it and get a feel for the teapot I'm investing in."
3,"A little expensive, but ""okay"" hot sauce.","I bought this as a Christmas gift for my hubby, who is a hot sauce fanatic! The item description said that there would be a gift of some sort with the purchase, but it never came. Seller informed me that it was an outdated description and apologized. My husband likes most of the sauces he is sent (one per month), but it's definitely not worth the price, in both of our opinions (one sauce tasted like spicy ketchup)."
4,Great ideas for inspiring young writers!,"This book is a must-own for teachers of young children or of beginning writers of any age. I have successfully used the ideas with special-needs children grades k-6, and also in a balanced literacy/guided reading program. The ideas work especially well for including a variety of learning styles, as many of the mini-books lend themselves well to artistic expression, rhyme and repetition, choral reading, and hands-on assembly.Plus, the students are proud of these little handmade books, and start to think of themselves as writers!"
2,A Lot of Bad Songs,"This DVD contains some of the videos made during R.E.M.'s period with Warner Brothers. The technical quality of the DVD is quite good but over three-quarters of the songs on this DVD are bad songs. I think Bad Day, Man on the Moon, Everybody Hurts, Losing My Religion, Stand, and Orange Crush are all good to great songs, and What's the Frequency Kenneth is a decent song. Unfortunately, the rest of the DVD is album filler.Prior to buying this DVD, I would have never expected the equivalent of a ""best of"" album made by R.E.M. to have so many bad songs on it. I want my money back and I advise everyone else to buy something other than this DVD."
2,Not the definitive DVD I hoped for...,"I have always liked REM but never enough to buy every CD and DVD they have released. I had hoped this compilation would include all of their music videos...sort of a comprehensive video archive. It isn't like space is an issue on the DVD. Sadly this is not the case. Even during the period covered (1988-2003) there are so many popular videos missing!!!! I cannot even decide how they went about choosing the ones they have included.It is certainly a worthwhile addition to any REM fan's collection, however, not at fullprice! Certainly, many of us will continue waiting for that definitive collection we have hoped for (hint, hint, hint)."
4,"Great, but not complete","How come they didn't have the guts to include the video for Pop Song '89?Otherwise, great videos and sound. ""Coulda been a contender"" if it included Pop Song '89.Bill"
5,Skate Videos Don't Get Much Better Then This!!!,"I picked up this box set awhile back and I love it. Its worth grabbing just for ""Welcome To Hell"" alone, but getting the other three, including ""Jump Off A Building""? Come on, this is a no brainer! These are the videos that changed the face and attitude of skateboarding. Besides you get the oh-so-hilarious Elissa Steamer crying like a little girl when she eats pavement and who can forget Jamie Thomas' 50-50 grind into eternity at the end. One last great feature is the ridiculously awesome bails footage at the end (its some seriously painful stuff). Cheers!"
3,"Yes, meditation; no, originality.","This book claims to rediscover the ancient art of meditation. That may be true for Roy Masters personally, but hardly for the world. His meditation technique is basically a form of mindfulness. Mindfulness is taught in Buddhism, and psychology as therapy. Almost any complete book on meditation will include it in its basic form of being aware of your breath. You can extend this to the whole body, including thoughts. The advantage of Mr. Master's book is that it is put in a semi-Christian context. I recommend the book for those new to meditation, and for those who need a religious context for their meditation practice other than one of the eastern religions. I wish that someone like Herbert Benson would create a non-religious scientific context for meditation practice!"
1,Why?!?!?!,"Sorry this isn't a review, but what I think about what they are doing:Why do these people insist on driving members of the church of Jesus Christ away? How would you other Christians feel if people in the world had a job to make you leave yours? Just think about that. And Mormons arn't a cult. Also, if you wanted to find out about a person, do you ask that person, or do you ask a person who only has stereotypes? It makes me sick."
1,Horrible in teaching Pascal Programming!!!,"I used this book in a college Introduction to Computer Programming class and had to rely on an instructor who was a bad teacher. I ended up ailing the class because the book provided absolutly no assistance. In other words, if you're smart you won't rely on this book for an Introduction class, it won't help."
4,Nice,"This product replaced a glass carafe we had that broke. This carafe holds more and keeps the coffee warm longer. Only issue is be careful when the plunger doesn't seem to want to go down. While pressing the plunger, the coffee grinds erupted on my wrist and I got a little burn. Other than that, we enjoy the fact that more coffee is made at a time."
3,the price says what you get,"I love Cressi for most of their products. I have 2 cressi spearguns, a cressi wetsuite, 2 pairs of cressi gloves, etc.But I have to say that the cressi reel is not the best that you can get on the market. On the other hand it is for sure the cheapest...Probably if you are going for big games is not the best choice. In my personal experience I could easily manage with it fishes up to 10 Kg, but I've never caught something bigger. And, actually I've never used it as a real reel, but more as a ""line storage"", keeping the clutch always open and managing the line just by hands...So, if you are looking for a very good reel buy something else but be prepared to spend at least the double..P.S. the picture shows the old model (closed), but I've got the new open one.P.P.S. the caption says that is for Comanche, actually you can mount it on all Cressi spearguns (geronimo, geronimo pro, etc.)"
2,Very Thin File Jackets!,"In attempts to get better organized at work and at home, I've switched over from paper based folder jackets to clear plastic type. I've really liked the Office Depot ""Poly Project View Folers (Item 741-341)"", but came across the Pandaflex jackets and thought........what a deal! Wrong, these are about half as thick as the Office Depot and not very useful. Go ahead and spend the money for much better Office Depot or similar product. They are much more durable!"
3,Good but not Great!,"Nba live 2005 is a good game, it is a more realistic game, the animations are smooth and the graphics are good. The all star mode is very addictive, but the dunk contest is very challenging, and take careful timing n precision to pull off dunks. Overall the game is ok, but if your looking for a more realistic basketball game goget espn nba 2k5."
5,Praise for Kristin Hannah,"This was my first Kristin Hannah book, but it won't be my last. Ms. Hannah has a way of allowing the reader to connect on an emotional level with each of the main characters. The sections of the story told through the eyes of the child, ""Alice"", moved me to tears. This was a wonderful story of how trust is central to all human interaction and without trust, we cannot love.Tammy Wood"
2,Disappointed,"The story of a young girl found in a city park after apparently living in the wild since a very young age, seemed intriguing at first. But, this was one of those times that I wish I'd read the sample before purchasing on my Kindle! The book read like a made-for-TV movie - very predictable at every turn. The story of Alice, the lost little girl, was the only redeeming aspect of the book."
4,"Different, and Engrossing Story","This book is completely different in story line from Hannah's other books. Since the idea of a feral child was so far fetched, I wasn't sure what to expect of this book.I was pleasantly surprised. Hannah made the story very interesting, and seemingly believable to read. The characters were compassionate, but not over the top. This is a long book, but I didn't feel that it dragged on. I enjoyed and recommend this book."
5,A Fascinating Novel about a Feral Child,"I have read many of Ms. Hannah's novels and enjoyed all of them.. But she scored a homerun with this one. It grabbed me from the first page and never let go. This novel tells the story of Alice, a Feral child. The only downside for me was that I felt very sorry for Alice's biological father.Read it!"
3,Not bad,"It is built with standard materials, but it works, that's what matters. The numbers are fine for children to learn ...I am satisfied with the purchase."
5,Thrilled to no end!,"Ghost was everything I had hoped it to be and more. The video was incredible. The music is smooth,upbeat, the dance routines out of this world, not to mention the various characters Michael portrays. Michael is in his true form and right back to where his fans once loved him. This box set is a definite must for any collector."
5,A book every girl should read,"Unfortunately, this book is out of print, but as a child it was one of my favorite books, and I read it many, many many times. Jade is a colonial era 17 year old girl from an aristocratic family. She refuses to be constrained by the conventions of her time and learns fencing, frees slaves, and becomes a pirate. Her personal moral code is fascinating and Jade strikes a blow for women and for the subjugated. Its a rollicking adventure story with a wonderful female heroine."
2,Compression poly hose end cap,There are other products out there that's better than this one. I recommend buying the one that is ribbed so you can tighten it using a hose clamp. This one is so awful I had to use a duct tape because it can't handle the water pressure even though the material is OK. I give it two stars for the material but the design is awful.
2,Full of misinformation,"This book presents like a children's book. But worse, its information and advice are based on inaccurate myths, such as one should avoid canola oil or the notion that if your digestive system is truly healthy, your elimination should fit a particular profile. While there's good information mixed in with the bad, the reader shouldn't have to make those determinations in each chapter; that's the author's job, after all. You don't need to spend money for inaccurate health information; it can be found all over the internet for free. Definitely wouldn't recommend."
4,A Moment of Truth,"I had heard about this book 5-6 years ago, and have used the concept of Moments of Truth without having read the book. The book is small very readable and has fleshed out the Moment very well. Anybody in business should read this book, and should have it in their library. It would change your thinking about who and what is important in dealing with customers."
2,Disappointed,"This book is a good source of uplifting and encouraging stories about children and adults who learn and think visually and who don't make a good fit with traditional schooling methods. However, excessive use of anecdotes and testimonials culled from her website eventually make the book read like an infomercial. While the author has a great amount of clinical experience she has never made the jump from her intuition based on this experience to rigorously defining or confirming any of it. She honestly declares that she ""has no numbers to crunch"" and is ""not in the numbers game"".Because the author is so comfortable with untested ideas I don't feel that any of the information presented can be considered reliable. If you are looking for feel-good affirmations it will provide them. It also provides the message that if your child can't learn to read that's OK because reading won't be necessary in our ""post-literate, technological world""."
1,Title doesn't deliver,"This is touted as a CLL Sourcebook, but it really a CML book that has had some wording changed to make it fit implications for CLL (CML and CLL are completely different diseases, and thus are treated very differently). Very misleading title. Also, the book is seriously out of step with current research (ok, research, and treatment are moving very fast in this area). Resource list is too general for CLL."
5,Great reading!!,"This book was great. From the heart, real and geniune. At times I thought it bounced around a bit, but it always did so staying on trakc. This man has had an increadibly interesting life, from the old world of poland, to the fast streets of New York. He answers the question which many of us ask: How are sky scrapers built?"
1,More Hissy Fit that Biography,"Hiding behind the ploy of biography, Libeskind gives a biased version of the Ground Zero fiasco all the while criticizing the other players in a forum where they have no chance of rebuttal. Libeskind barely stops short of hair-pulling and face-scratching in his catty and cowardly attack. Similar stories of his other projects in London and Berlin left me with the impression that this very pretentious man has some misguided notions of his own importance and intellectual capabilities. Unfortunately, most of this poorly written account reads like tabloid journalism and Libeskind's relentless self-congratulation was extremely annoying. Hardly a life worth emulating or even knowing about. This ego-driven exercise is easily the worst book I've read this year ."
1,Full of himself.,"Reading this book, I couldn't help myself laughing out loud at the smug, self-satisfied arrogance of Daniel Libeskind. God better watch out, because Danny is coming to take over his job. - Awful book, actually"
1,"TERRIBLE AUDIO, BORING MOVIE","NEVER JUDGE A BOOK BY IT'S COVERThis is one of the worst BluRays I've ever bought.The movie is boring, it could had been much better with the plot they had, it's slow and confusing.What I hated the most was the audio, the special effects are way too loud and the dialoge is not loud enough as to understand.I understand why Sean Penn and Naomi Watts took this movie, there was a lot to be done with the plot but in the end between the editor and the sound engineers managed to come up with PURE CRAP."
4,"Very Good, Not Great","In general, it was good. Some parts of the story were over done. If I say any more, I'll give away too much of the story."
5,More J-Pop than soundtrack but...,"This Origa album is more j-pop than soundtrack. What i mean by that is for all of you who are familiar with Origa's work with the incomparable Yoko Kanno will find this album a little lacking. However, I would still highly recommend it. If you like her voice (who doesn't?), don't hesitate to order it. If you don't like j-pop, spend some time sampling it. If you love J-pop and Kanno, order it without hesitation...it is fine music by any account. It has been in my playlist for weeks now and hasn't gotten old."
5,"Not as good as some other books from Adams, but still great.","Somehow, as soon as you start to think Dilbert is dying and few new ideas are coming around to Scott Adams, he creates another succesful collection of hilarious comics. And while it's not as great as some other efforts, this is still a good buy. Any kind of Dilbert comics you want are in here, whether it be about secretaries, interns, strange, bizarre, or anoying co-workers, and anything else you might want."
2,Dilbert May Be Running Out of Gas,"I think this compilation of Dilbert strips from 1998 and 1999 show that Scott Adams is running out of funny ideas. I haven't laughed much at Dilbert the last couple of years and this collection confirms that. I have been a big fan of Dilbert since the early 90's, but I think Scott Adams' dependence on reader input for ideas instead of those generated from his own corporate experiences (he quit his job several years ago) is starting to drag the strip down. I also think Mr. Adams' is spending too much time on the business side of Dilbert (TV shows, product marketing) to give the strip the attention it needs. I hope that he'll remember what got him where he is today and focus his energy on his comic strip in the future. If you've got all the books, get it, but if you want some laughs, try some of the earlier Dilbert compilation books instead."
1,ALLERGY WARNING!,WOW...I WAS VERY ALLERGIC TO THIS ITEM.IF YOU START BREAKING OUT IN A RASH STOPTAKING IMMEDIATELY. I ENDED UP AT THEDOCTORS OVER THIS STUFF.
5,Good transaction. Exceptional DVD.,"DVD arrived promptly, packaged well. I would recommend this, and any other presentations by Dr. Sherri Tenpenny. This is for people who are willing to think outside of the box, and to take the time to find out the TRUTH about vaccinations. What she has to say is truly eye-opening."
1,"NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME - OR ANYTIME, FOR THAT MATTER","This device is a total waste of money. I'd give it ZERO stars if I could but since one star is the lowest allowable, I give it one star (while holding my nose!). It took two weeks for delivery to begin with (I'd forgive that if it was worth waiting for), specifications don't list the screen resolution (I've seen better QVGA displays), very slow recharge rate, sluggish controls (non-intuitive), poorly written on-screen instructions, unit locks up repeatedly, shiney plastic bezel shows smudges and finger prints.... I could go on, but I'll wrap it up by saying that the unit doesn't work. I didn't even get to the part of trying videos because just viewing 6 megapixel JPEGs was tedious enough and the photos looked crappy. If this junk is any measure of Nextar's other products - PASS as quickly as possible (I know I will). I'm returning it ASAP."
3,Nature's Cancer Fighting Foods,One can eat all organic food with the exception of red meat. We know it anyway. The book is too detailed although it seems well researched.
4,What?,"Order came in a timely manner, and does indeed cut the shaker pattern. After only a limited amount of use the cutters appear to be getting dull."
1,Stop!!! read this before buying,"i purchased the first season from amazon.... amazon prime... not a third party and it is a knock off... there are NO subtitles.... there is NO PLAY ALL file.... just 4 episodes.... my son has this exact same first season with a play all file and subtitles....why amazon lumps blu-rays, dvds, amazon, amazon seller, and third party sellers together is beyond my understanding... the content is good,,,, the product is NOT!!!"
5,It's about time......,"Overall, its great.The setting, atmosphere, is astounding. The production is amazing. I personally think Sopranos blows Goodfellas, The Last Don, Gotti, and Godfather out of the water. I mean, dont get me wrong, but at 15, I can totally relate to the sopranos much more than the classics. I waited for the day for this to come out of video and my dream has come true."
3,"Spectacular, but a few flaws","For the most part, the Blu-Ray edition of Sopranos Season One looks fantastic. The colors are bold and vivid and the production has a realistic three-dimensional look.However ... dark interior scenes and night-time scenes are way too dark, especially in the pilot and first three or four episodes. Sometimes the characters' faces are completely lost in shadow. I have watched this on DVD several times and these scenes looked very different. Scenes inside the ""Bing"", for example, look as if someone cranked the contrast up way too high.Most of the episodes look spectacular, but the dark scenes often look muddy. Overall this is a major improvement over the DVD, but I wish I hadn't traded my old discs in before buying this, because I'd like to compare the dark scenes with the Blu-Ray."
3,I would buy it if it were cheaper!,"I have to say that this series is brilliant. The first season grabs you. However, not being rich denies me certain priveleges, such as owning this series on dvd. I mean, come on! The first season is going for $40-50, used!! I just can't afford it, and you're lucky if you can! This would get a much better review if HBO made it more affordable. No matter how good it is, it doesn't make me want to go bankrupt buying it! Just because it's critically acclaimed shouldn't make it instantly expensive."
5,amazing and interesting,this show is one of the best HBO shows i've ever seen. any one who is interested in the mafia story should get this DVD.
4,Lives up to the hype,"I'm probably the last person on the planet to watch the Sopranos. At first I thought that the genre would turn me off. Then I thought that it would be too muddled in Mafioso minutiae to hold my interest. Little did I expect a family story in keeping with the OC only on the East Coast and instead of a left leaning attorney father figure, I'd find a two fisted family man. Instead of bagels with a schemer we get pasta in take out containers.The family is a caricature of the typical East Coast Italian clan. We get momma who lays guilt on her kids, Uncle Pussy with the heart of gold (and lead), Uncle Junior who's at the end of his reign of leadership and the wife who has the hots for the parish padre.Tony hooks up with a head shrink which strikes fear into the ""family"" as they are sure he's telling tales ""out of school"". All in all, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this series and have every intention to purchase Season II......bg"
4,Just out of curiosity,"I heard all the buzz about the show, and somehow never got interested on it. After a while someone recomended it and decided to rent the first season. I found the pilot pretty boring but decided to give it a try. Don't regret it at all. Great show indeed. I'll check season two soon."
3,"Great content, poor packaging","A warning to those of you with HDTV's: These episodes are packed 4 to a single-sided disc. The compression required to do this seriously degrades the picture quality. The compression artifacts are atrocious in some scenes, detracting greatly from what is, in general, great cinematography.But, as the title states, the content itself is great gangster cinema in the tradition of The Godfather."
5,The GREATEST show on television,"Wow...what can I say that hasn't been said already. Great story, great acting, believable characters... Thankfully this is on cable instead of network television. ABC passed on this and HBO went for it. I bet they're thankful! Having the DVD series to watch instead of waiting for next week's episode was a real treat. My wife and I love this show and it's about the only reason we continue to pay for HBO. We play the trivia game on HBO's website and we are truly looking forward to season 3 in March. We also can't wait for season 2 to come out on DVD. If you haven't seen this show yet, I can't recommend it enough. As long as you aren't offended by some graphic language, violence and sex, you'll enjoy this as much as we do. This is not a children's show, by any stretch, but it is really good entertainment for consenting adults."
2,"Gimmick, not a revolution","To summarize, instead of the promised revolutionary concept the author delivers a promotion for his latest gimmick. After reading the ""meat"" of the book, a business-savvy reader can almost ""taste"" the author's vision: dozens of slick consultants from David's own Results Coaching Systems, Inc. ""helping"" innovative executives to transform their organizations. While the scholastic value of this book is minimal, it does raise the reader's awareness of the new research correlating human brain activity with job performance and motivation. I just wish someone with less business interests and better academic credentials has written about the topic."
4,Insightful,"First half of book was very good. Good insights on listening and how people become more accepting of ideas. At the end of each chapter is a practical exercise to help you ""know thyself."" A few seem contrived. Still many will give you a better understanding of how you interact and respond to others. The second half of the book was less valuable. It felt labored and less realistic as I though about conversations I have. If you read this book, your mind will likely wander to others around you. The good ideas in this book will not catch on unless you give them a try."
1,Do not buy this!! Horrible!!!,"Bought this to catch some shut eye on a plane trip and it is horrible!! Difficult to inflate, after 30 mins or so it starts losing air and deflating on it's own! Wish I never bought it! Poor quality. When it does inflate it is too bulky! Overpriced as well! I wish I could give it 0 stars- that's how bad it is!!!!"
2,"Product works (somewhat) but has Smell, Air Leakage, and is uncomfortable","I purchased this product a while back and tried it out twice. First thing first, THIS PRODUCT SMELL!!!When I first used this product it wasn't that bad but after 20 min or so I had serious neck and back pain. I had to take out some of the air and made a pillow out of it leading against the window. It was okay but was not as comfortable as a normal pillow.On my second time, this product was useless peace of junk. Air keep leaking out.To me, this is more like a one-time use of a no-good-pillow product."
3,Shaolin draging-on,"Not to blame the movie but this was in very poor quality, my friend has paid a buck for some in better viewing condition. This movie had good fight scenes worthy of watching. The time it took to get to the actual challenge the story is based upon I flipped to some cartoons to kill the time. Feeling guilty about missing scenes while watching cartoons I scanned back and watched the skipped over scenes, I didn't miss anything.The fight scenes make this movie worth it, fast forward through the rest."
3,"Good Fighting, Poor Editing.","The editing was poor to say the least. The film just shut down and went black for a few moments while the sound kept going. However, I must say in only blacked out four-five times, and only once in an interesting point. The color went a little hazy at times but would quickly shift back to normal. Would I buy it again? Yeah. Good flick with cool Kung-Fu. Without the editing burps, I would have given in a four."
3,It's alright,I like the size of the phone. I also dropped this phone on the concrete several times and it still works! Very reliable.
3,Sharp looking but the paint doesn't last.,I've had this case cover for about a month and the rubberized paint is already coming off. Everything else is top notch!
3,A little underwhelming,"As mentioned in other reviews, this product fits a Razr V3m near perfectly. It snaps on with little/no trouble and has very good alignment for the camera, spearker, mic and even the ""M"" logo on the front. Nice that you can remove the ratchiting belt clip nub and belt clip so that the case is a little slimmer for those that like to put the phone in a pocket.What I do not like is that it is a little on the cheap-feeling / flimsy side (what do you expect for $3.00?) and has an odd plastic/solvent oder to it which I'm hoping will dissapate with use.3-stars for being an average product.UPDATE: Well, $3.00 says it all. The case now has multiple cracks (no, I haven't dropped it -- when it's with me, it is usually in a pocket). Still rated at 3 stars, just don't expect it to last very long."
3,"Cover is nice, but the clip is junk","The cover worked well and fit properly. The clip was large, cumbersome, and did not secure the phone effectively. The clip's size positions the phone at least an inch away from your waist; I found myself snagging the phone unintentionally or hitting it with my arm. Not a bad product, just could use an improved clip design."
2,Eats batteries,"The picture quality of this camera is very good but so is that of a lot of camera's on the market today. I have two big problems with this product. The first is that I assumed I'd save some money on batteries switching from lithium (from my last camera) to regular AA's. One pair of batteries did not last even one Thanksgiving afternoon(about 30 photos in all.) Part of this is due to my second complaint which is the on/off dial. It is VERY loose so that almost every time I put the camera away in my purse or baby bag, when I retrieve it the camera is already switched on. I wish I'd gone ahead and bought a decent camera though it would have cost two to three times the cost of this one."
4,Kodak EasyShare C340 5MP Digital Camera,"I bought the camera and picture printer for my 9-year old grandson. He quickly mastered it and is taking beautiful pictures with minimal supervision. The only problem is that the paper and ink kits are expensive,"
1,Basic Camera is Basically Pathetic,"I maintain a car dealership's website so having a good, dependable camera is very important. This camera was purchased by someone who is no longer here. If you want a reliable camera that takes decent shots, don't buy this camera. I carry this camera in a bag and it always turns itself on so the batteries get wasted. It doesn't always turn on the first time you switch it on. You have to switch to a special mode to get a decent close-up shot. It can't handle shots in dim lighting so unless it's really sunny out or a really well-lit room, forget about using this camera. Colors don't always appear right. Bright reds sometimes turn out looking orange which isn't good if you're selling a bright red car. In my humble opinion, Canon is the way to go."
4,Easy to handle,"I bought this camera for my mother at Christmas. She is a person who needs something VERY simple to operate, and it worked out very well for her. The display screen is not huge, but it's large enough for her average eye-sight.Learning to take, review and delete photos was very quick for her. It took a lesson or two for her to learn how to download the images onto her computer.I'm also impressed with the quality of the images. A nice, simple camera to carry around for any ocassion."
2,Sound quality is really atrocious,"I consider myself ""a reasonably accommodating listener"" and am a big fan of both Richter and Schumann.I have recordings from the 1920's and 1930's of both jazz and classical music that have been transferred to discwith better sound than these 1970's recordings.With so much better recorded Richter out there from which to choose, only a masochist would select this.I'm glad I got to hear it, but it would be painful to listen to again."
3,I noticed a difference!,"Don't expect to look like Angelina Jolie, but I noticed a little fuller look in my lips. It's more noticable if you wear it alone, which looks fine b/c it has a slight color to it. It goes on very smooth and wet, so you can wear it in place of ChapStick or lip gloss."
2,"Good at first, but not built to last.","I coach both of my son's basketball teams and use a pump several times a week. When I got this one, I REALLY liked it. The gauge was accurate and made it easy to properly fill the balls to the correct level. However, after less than a year, the pressure gauge part started coming off (it uses friction to stay together) and it got increasingly difficult to use without it coming apart. I tried gluing it with several different adhesives, but could not get it to stay together for more than a few uses. Also note that the picture shows an inflation hose. Mine did not come with that and thus it was a little tricky inflating balls without breaking a needle. I would NOT let my kids use the pump for this reason. It's a shame because I really did like it when it was new."
1,Big Disappointment/ Junk,"I had previously owned this same item and was happy with it. I lost it and bought a replacement. The second one I purchased was a complete piece of junk. There was no hose, the glass on the pump guage has a crack. I tried using it without the hose and as soon as I inserted the needle into the ball air gushed out of the pump where the piston shaft moves up and down deflating the ball I was trying to fill. The difference between this pump and the exact same item I previously purchased is like night and day. The price was good and the shipping was free but nothing can make up for a poorly made product that does not matche it's description or even function at all. Go to a store and find one that works and buy it there. I honestly believe that this was a defective unit that was repackaged without its hose and sent out as new. Don't buy this item."
4,good with other things,"some of the words on the vocab list were ridiculous - ""bacterium"" - but many of them were very helpful. I used it in conjunction with the word list provided in the back of my GRE book and together there's probably 1000 words. The flashcards come already made - you don't have to make them yourself. Very convienient. ""Plastic carry pouch"" is a ziplock bag. But good product."
2,DON'T BUY THIS DVD!!! GET THE VHS!!!,I own this classic on VHS so I had to have the DVD. What a big mistake while the picture quality is good for it's time on a stereo T.V. there's noise but that's not the problem it seems the transfer was taken from a bad copy there's hiccups in the film that equals to 15 minutes of missing footage how could they release it this way? SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET THE VHS!!
1,IT AIN'T A CELESTIAL PICTURES RELEASE !!!,"THIS DVD LIKE SO MANY RELATED TO THE SHAW BRORTHERS COLLECTION, THAT ARE NOT RELEASED BY CELESTIAL PICTURES ARE A SHAM !!! I WILL NOT SUPPORT SOME LOW DOWN PIRATES LOOKING TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK !! IF IT AIN'T A CELESTIAL RELEASE IT AIN'T WORTH A DIME !!!"
3,A needed book but could have been better,"This book deals with an issue that our culture needs to consider. Our world is a better place because of Christ working through His people. However, Kennedy was too general in his discussion. I believe his book would be more powerful if he had given more details. As one who is interested in history, I find this book lacking in historical context."
3,A Preacher Preaches,"While Kennedy is a fine Biblical scholar, he does not follow through on the book's title. Many of the world's accomplishments would have been made in spite of the life of Christ by well-meaning people. The author was preaching too much in a book that implied historical content."
2,Ok,"This book might not be what you expect. When you read the title you probably thought, ""This is just another book about how we would be in hell without Jesus."" That's what I thought at first too. Instead it tells how Jesus impacted this world, even after he ascended into heaven. It also tells how some Christians impacted the world.At times I found this book a bit boring, but that's what I expected when I started the book(since I'm only 14 years-old).Overall, if you want to read a book about how Jesus and Christian leaders impacted this world, you could probably find a better book elsewhere."
5,This is the one you want!,This is the realest uptown classic on the planet! There is no denying that this is the tightest CD to come from the BG before he rose to fame with Juvenile and the Hot Boys. The songs will bring tears to your eyes! Every song is tight with hard beats and lyrics that will stay in your head for months! You have not lived until you have heard this CD!
1,Extremely disappointing follow-up,"While I enjoyed Wicked, I felt that Son of a Witch was terrible. Maquire depicts Oz as a Hieronymus Bosch-like quagmire populated by uncaring, amoral misfits who care about nothing, including themselves. The plot lines eventually come together somewhat but are so convoluted that it is hard to become involved in the book, and very hard to care about any the characters depicted.Liir is simply bland. He has no drive or direction and wanders from one situation to another in a vague, listless mannner. The only interesting character is the young Maunt, Candle, and she simply is lost in the end. Also, there is an unusual twist about Liir's sexual preference, not that there's anything wrong with that, that to be was out of the blue, and just bizarre.I really hated this book. I slogged through it, but it was a waste of time."
5,Enjoyed this 2nd in Series Book,"Got hooked on the Wicked Years series after reading the first book, Wicked. Really enjoyed this follow up story on the next events happening in the life of Liir. The ending brings it all together and leaves you hanging, ready for the next book."
2,Wickedly Disappointing,"It's certainly not a sequel. I give you that. However, Son of a Witch pales in comparison to its predecessor. Wicked artfully conglomerated politics and plot into a delightful story, flip-flopping all of the notions of Oz that were planted into our heads as children. Elphaba becomes a heroine, Glinda seems more vapid than a kiddie pool but oddly clever at the same time -- everyone is relatable.Son of a Witch's overriding weaknesses are its over-reliance on skimpy metaphors, its pale and unrelatable characters (it wasn't just Elphaba who shone in Wicked), and its too overt political message. Politics are all well and good, but leave the reader to do a little bit of the work . . .We've seen all of this before: flying on brooms, identity crises, an attempt to visit powerful politicals . . . Give me a break. Give me a better plot. And give me characters I can root for."
2,One big fat - eh,"Basically I'd give this book a rating of ""eh"". It seems like a book I'd like. It is written in a perfectly competent manner. It has a creative idea at its root. It is internally consistent. It just didn't pull me in.I just can't seem to find any soul soul in Maguire's writing and execution of the concepts. I really like his idea and his premise. I enjoy fantasy. I enjoy satirical fantasy. I just can't get excited about his books.Then again they are written in an ok fashion and not bad per se I just don't get pulled in so maybe it will work for someone else."
4,decent enough read,"*spoiler alert*liir was such indecisive character. He spent most of his time either escaping reality or thinking about how possible it was that elphaba was his mum. The story was extremely slow at times, but as if on que would pick up the pace once it got too droll. I didn't really have anything against the excessive self discovery/realisation bits, but I was definitely pissed off at how after all that happened, he was still the same wishy washy character he was at the start of the book. After all his wanting to be emotionally attached to someone, he just HAD to go and mess things up by being indecisive. Ah well, if only the end didn't leave you in the dark about so many things, like: Is he a bi? Has realising who his mum is, changed his perception of himself? Did the chic abondon him because of the baby(or his divided affections), or did she really try to lead the soldiers away from him?"
3,My take on Son of a Witch,"Having read Wicked, I was really looking forward to reading Son of a Witch. It was quite enjoyable, but there were some parts that I found would leave the reader confused as they trailed off without adequate explanation. A good beginning and enough of a plot to make me want to keep reading, however I found the end disappointing."
4,Great sequel!,"""Son of a Witch"" is another great read by G. Maguire. If you read ""Wicked"" and enjoyed it, you are sure to to enjoy this one as well. It is also set in Maguire's fantastic version of Oz with its full host of entertaining, mythological characters. It is effective in showing a boy's coming of age and discovering his own identity within the politics of Oz. Despite himself, he becomes wrapped up in this world of which he has little comprehesion."
2,"A sorry follow up to ""Wicked""...","I couldn't even force myself to read this entire book. I loved ""Wicked"" (and am also a fan of the musical) but ""Son of a Witch"" (though cleverly titled) wasn't as amazing. The beggining of the book held my attention and made me want to read more, but as I went the interest fell and the book droned. The main thing that turned me off was the tedious quality of this book--I have always been very attentive to detail (this is one reason why I loved ""Wicked"") and ""Son of a Witch"" was either completely devoid of it, or it was disgustingly oversauced in it. Wither way, the plot becomes amazingly confusing and ridiculous (reminds me of a soap opera). I had to stop reading because I was so bored and confused (both at once--weird I know)."
3,I'm not really sure what I think,"The book was really well written but at times, it just completely lost me and I found myself wondering, what's the point? I like the series so far but it's always leaving me wanting more and not always in the best way."
4,Great,"I bought this book for one of my coworkers (Christmas Party) and she loves it!I haven't read it myself, but she says that this book is very good. :)"
3,Author's reading of Son of a Witch.,This audio version of Son of a Witch was read and performed by the Author Gregory McGuire. Unfortunately his rendition of this book was a big disappointment when compared to the wonderful Audio book version of Wicked (the first book in the series) read by John McDonough. Mr. McDonough brought these characters to life with unique voices and personalities for each character. These books are very unusual and need a very strong performer to take the listener away on the amazing journey that was so well written by the Author.
4,Can't wait for the last installment!,"Granted, this is not Wicked. But it is an excellent book, and I love where Maguire has taken this tale. I can't wait to read what must be a third book in this series - I am intrigued about the ""loose ends"" others mention - think of it like ""empire strikes back"" and you'll be okay with it!! Liir definitely does his share of whining and wandering in the desert, but the themes that echo our current politics and the revelations he makes at the end are fantastic."
2,Wicked was better,"Wicked was overall good with some bad/ slow parts, while Son of a Witch was overall bad/ slow with some good parts. I really want to like it but it has proven to be difficult. A lot of skimming and I really don't feel like I have missed much."
2,Disappointing narration,"I'm listening to this one immediately after finishing Wicked, and I have to say I'm disappointed. Wicked was a good story itself, but the reading by John McDonough was brilliant and made it everything an audio book should be. I didn't look at the narrator when I reserved this from the library and assumed McDonough would be doing this one as well; I was wrong. Boy, was I wrong. Maguire is a talented writer, but however passionate about the story, his reading falls flat. Odd intonation, melodramatic rhythm, indistinguishable character voices, and an overall lack of modulation in his voice make this, so far, a very dull listen. I don't know that I'll be able to finish, regardless of how interesting the story may be."
3,Enjoyable,"I was so enchanted with Maguire's Wicked, how could I not snatch up Son of a Witch? Son of a Witch was enjoyable but never really grabbed me. I can't even remember how it ended. Did Liir ever find his half-sister? It touches on issues of destiny/dharma. If you liked Wicked, go ahead and read Son of a Witch. I won't discourage anyone."
2,Son Of A Witch,"I really enjoyed his book ""Wicked"" and looked forward to the release of ""Son Of A Witch"". I finished 'Wicked"" and immediately began the journey of ""Son of a Witch"". I was very disappointed that the narrator of ""Wicked"", John McDonough, was not used for ""Son Of A Witch"". I purchased the audio book CD hoping for the best. Mr. Maguire is a brilliant author but sadly is not trained as a narrator. At times it is difficult to listen to the book because I was spoiled with Mr. McDonough's extraordinary performance. I wish Gregory Maguire would request a ""do over"" for the audio version of ""Son Of A Wtich"" using Mr. McDonough?"
2,An Oz fan disappointed,"I love The Wizard of Oz. It was one of the first books my mom ever read to me and I was Dorothy for years for Halloween. I loved Wicked, its twist on the story only increased my love of OZ. But alas Son of a Witch was boring. While Maguire paints a beautiful landscape with his words, the only good thing I can say about the book is that it set up for an interesting third installment. Only read if he decided to write the third book."
1,Son of a What?,"I checked this out as a book-on-CD from the local library to listen to on the way to and from work. The book was initially interesting but by the end of the first CD had become merely frustrating. By the end of the second CD my patience had expired with this, the first book on CD or tape that I found unworthy of completion.The problem, pure and simple, is that the only thing worse than the author's writing is his reading! Now and then a clever or picturesque turn of phrase suggests that the author may be on to something but then return the inconsistent characterizations, random application of big and unusual words, and just plain awkward style. A better narrator might have made the book sound better by more smoothly reading the text or by making it easier to tell one character from the next but the author's flat and unappealling reading makes his writing seem if anything even worse than it is.The book on CD is unlistenable. Pass on this one and go see ""Wicked"" on stage!"
2,Major Letdown,this book was a major letdown. i kept waiting for something to happen & it never did. after reading the book i can't say i have any idea of what the plot was or for that matter what the point of the book was. (other than to cash in on the success of wicked). get it out of the library if you want to read it. that way you won't waste your money.
5,Simply Amazing Sequel,"I have to say, I was first a fan of the Broadway musical based on the first book. However, the book and the musical are very different and since I knew this before I began reading, I was not deterred by the darker nature of Maguire's work. I enjoyed Son of a Witch even more than I did Wicked. I will admit that the book starts off a bit slow and was sometimes hard to follow, but I became so entranced in the story that I finished the whole second half of the book in one day. I was drawn in by the vivid characters Maguire created and am hoping he writes a third book because this one kept me wanting more."
2,Pointless reading,"There was just too many questions hanging unanswered at the end.The author spends too much time describing -in such ANNOYING detail- things that aren't important, but leaves all the important detail out. I don't even know what most of the characters look like because the descriptions were pretty much non-existent.I skipped a lot being there were a CHAPTERS that would only talk about how the character felt. Very disappointed, and not so optomistic about book 3. Hopefully all the questions from this book will be answered then."
3,OK...sort of,"The problem here is that Maguire seems to have shot his wad with ""Wicked."" He reminds me of Ann Rice in that respect, both in the fact that I started out extremely enthusiastic about their writing styles and stories only to watch them fizzle.* It was a mildly interesting read in parts, but extremely boring in others. Another reviewer advised to avoid comparing ""Son..."" to ""Wicked"" when reading the book, but as it IS intended to be a sequel I don't think one can or should forget about its predecessor. I found ""Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister: A Novel"" and ""Mirror, Mirror: A Novel,"" to be more intriguing, as they each had the grounding quality of being semi-historical novels.*Actually, I overdosed on The Vampire Chronicles. One can read about vampires going out to kill and then spending the rest of the evening in a museum swooning over Italian art only so many times."
3,"Good camera, not perfect","PROS: 1. Unbeatable Price, 2. Very good sharpness (not excellent), 3.Intuitive and easy-to use. 4.good performance un AUTO, better in other functions. 5.Good video quality, adequate in poor lighting. 6. adequate digital zoom (if you have a very steady hand). 7. performs well in low light (using manual). 8.Very flexible for the ""family/vacation shooter"".CONS: 1. Mediocre software, 2.Poor macro/close-up fuction (closest focusing = 9cm. aprox.), 3.Diopter diffcult to manipulate, 4.Strange and very light violet cast/hue on certain pix (still don't know why). 5. Need two batteries so as to not lose info on camera. 6.Some focusing difficulties. 7. No spot-metering in manual mode(doesn't say this in the manual).Bottom line: for a camera its price and its class, it's very hard to beat. Built for the very advanced ""familiy/vacation shooter"", not quite flexible enough for the avid amateur. Has some quirks I can live with."
5,"Great camera, software be dammed!","Everything that has been said is accurate. However, the software CAN be bypassed. With Windows XP Professional there is default camera software that works with the z730 (even on Windows 64 bit edition!)I have mine configured to create a folder (that has an autoname of the date) and download all the pictures whenever I plug in the camera. I don't even have to click anything. Plug, download, erase from camera, unplug. Highly reccomended."
4,A very nice digital camera,"I've had my camera for about two years. It holds about 20 pictures a 5 MP/ea without an extra memory card. The pictures are nice an clear. I can't imagine needing anything more than 5 MP.I have had some trouble with strange light spots appearing on the pictures in flourescent lighting, but I haven't been able to figure out why. Indoor group pictures can also be a little difficult if lighting isn't adequate. Usually, I can edit the photo on the computer to ""turn on the lights"" later."
2,I must have gotten a dud...,"I bought this camera a few days ago and none of the pictures that I have taken have come out right. The LCD screen appears dark and blurry. 95% of the pictures that I have taken have come out blurry. The color quality is dull, not what I usually see with Kodak cameras. The software is useless. A friend on mine owns the Kodak DX7440 (which is the exact same camera but 4 megs instead of 5) takes beautiful pictures with vibrant colors."
1,Show Great - But Disc is Missing Episodes,"The show is amazing as reviews state. However, the disc advertises 16 episodes and there are only 8. The same issue occured for Season 2. Amazon sent a replacement disc - still only 8 episodes."
5,Perfect Dvd For Christmas!!!,This Dvd is perfect for Christmas season especially for today this Dvd includes a episode called: She's A Good Skate Charlie Brown its an amazing Dvd its a gotta have for Peanuts fans! it even includes the Charlie Brown and Snoopy show which is very entertaining and very funny!
4,Order to fill in my collection,"They are close to original, but there is a noticeable difference in size and depth of plates and saucers. Also the scalloped edge on cup is not as prononced as the original ones I have."
