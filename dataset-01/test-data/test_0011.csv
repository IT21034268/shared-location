5,A classic but not antique,"Beautiful movie. Everyone should see this movie, not because it is required but because it is an entertaining movie that has timeless themes of love and nobility."
1,The most boring movie I have ever seen!,"I saw this old classic in my film class several years ago and since I am hearing impaired, I simply never had the chance to learn its story that seemed to hold the audience spellbound for several generations. So here I just sat and stared as the dull b&w scenes rolled slowly right by and nothing much seemed to happen. But at least I recognized the famous scene at the very ending where Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman turned to look at each other by the plane - but that's all. Sorry, but it was a very very bland experience for me as the deaf viewer."
3,No widescreen? What gives?!,"This is one of the greatest movies ever made, and the transfer to Blu-Ray looks and sounds great, but why isn't it in widescreen format? I'm pretty sure that even back in the 1940's, feature films were shot in a widescreen format to be shown in movie theatres. Why couldn't they take the original widescreen version of this film and transfer it to Blu-Ray? Instead it's in the standard 4:3 television aspect ratio."
3,"Real Carlos has Brown Eyes, Imposter has Blue Eyes",The movie opens with the real Carlos showing dark brown eyes. The Imposter (USN-LCDR) has blue eyes. It may seem like a small point to many. But to me it ruined the entire movie.
3,"Entertaining, but uneven","Ben Kingsley & Donald Sutherland were great as usual. Aidan Quinn was fascinating to watch, but maybe - not sure -- too nice a guy to play his evil alter ego. The movie had an ambiguous feeling: it wanted to be a sexy thriller and a serious spy flick with deeper implications about the nature and source of human behavior. Overall, interesting and kinda good, but not great."
3,Hum.....,"This is the most appalling,grotesque book I have ever read although he does a good job at keeping you interested. I found it hard to finish though as some of the contents are shocking and downright sickening. But yet I read on even onto the 2nd book which I also finished and will also read the 3rd. I loved Jean Auels books and have been waiting for her next one to come out and these books are a somehwhat good replacement to hers although based on a male character. These books are NOT for weak at heart so if you get shocked and grossed out easily I would not recommend it but otherwise go for it. The characters are full of life and spirit and you will want to read on to see what happens next."
3,not copper,"Used it for the first time, it is beautiful until you use it. The copper paint flakes off revealing dark steel like metal under.The removable handle is spectacular and THE reason I ordered it, but it is NOT compatible with any other pans made by this company."
2,Colored is painted!,I will not recommend to use this for cooking. Copper colored metal smells bad when you heat it up. I tried several times to heat it up to see if the smell will go away. There is no way we should put food and cook it or eat it after.
3,not as good,"towel is great as long as u dont wash it.after wash, no matter how gentle, its all downhillin every way"
4,Excellent pocket edition,"I bought this small pocket version of the Amplified Bible earlier, and I love it! It's easy to carry with me, but easy to loose. I did, so now I'm buying a new one.I will highly recommend this Bible for those who want to study the scripture instead of ""just"" reading it."
2,did not work,product did not work. wanted it to download music but it would never sync with computer it wouldn't charge the device either
4,"Pretty, dainty, worth your penny, but...","The set was agreeable in appearance I felt they were exactly what I had been looking for. They came precisly as advertised I was happy for some weeks. But, just like the fire opal set I bought at the same time as these, something in my skin did not approve and I suffered itchy ears and red, scab like skin, underneath the place holder on the back. I can assume the place holders were of the same make as the stud itself, but something about the opal set and this set made my ears painful. I'll just save them and have them cleaned to give them as a gift to some one with less sensitive ears than mine."
5,Finally!,"My dad was obsessed with an old pillow shaped like a dog bone, and I was convinced I couldn't replace it! I looked on Amazon and there were plenty to choose from! He'll be very happy to have a new one to replace the old/tattered pillow. It's a nice size and firmness...perfect!"
2,Too bulky for smaller sized women,"I'm 5'4"" and this pillow is too bulky for my neck. I took out about half of the stuffings and the center part which should fit the neck is still too wide to feel comfortable."
2,Too much revenge.,"Not much of a story. There is sympathy for the main character but too much repetition of the hurdles involved. At times the ""revenge"" theme just isn't enough of a story, and there is no more to the plot."
5,Sweet Revenge - Sisterhood Series #5,"The book I receieved was in very good condition. I love this series, it is getting better and better. Only wish I could find a package of the books as a bundle to order."
2,The worst book of the series,"I did not enjoy this book as much as the others in the series. There was tooooooooooo much of the two reporters, their romance, their following the women in the sisterhoold, etc. they were annoying and not essential to the book and I hope they are not in the next book. I much preferred Mark from the previous book.The book was about Isabelle's revenge but she was hardly in the book, nor for that matter was the sisterhood, though I must say the character of Rosemary was the best villian in the whole series.I hope the next book is better with more of the sisterhood and their methods of revenge (and bring back the character of Mark and x-out the reports)."
4,Solid performances,"Dee Dee's vocal style is clean and infectious. These are small group recordings, 8-9 excellent musicians, including Horace Silver on two tracks and Jimmy Smith on two others."
3,great if they learn to use it,"when the kid sees somebody using one, they want to ride it, otherwise just a good idea that has not caught on. and advanced, manuverable skateboard, make sure the kid cares about that, maybe overengineered, but well made, includes a DVD to explain how to use it."
4,Great gift!,My 8 year old son got this for his bday. He loves it! It has a steep learning curve. It took a solid 2-3 days for him to figure it out (a lot of frustration/throwing during that time) but now he cruises everywhere on it. He even took it to a intermediate skate park and skated the bowls with it!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"Do not buy this video card! Even though numbers sound impressive, they are not all what they seem to be. That 64mb of memory, can't go wrong there right. Wrong, that 64mb of memory gets chewed up faster than the 4 VSA-100 chips can swallow. Therefore that 64mb of memory becomes more like 24mb! And the Voodoo5 5500 inablility to produce per pixel shading or vertex skinning is astonishing. For it what gives you this graphics accelerater is not worth it's price. Don't buy this card. Buy yourself a nVidia GeForce2 GTS they cost the same price. Also the GeForce2 GTS has an on board GPU(which the Voodoo5 5500 does not) and does not need to reley on the system CPU to render light. Even though the Voodoo5 5500 is a decent card is not worth what 3dfx charges for it. Sure the box looks cool, but isn't what's inside that counts!"
5,Clockwork!,"Have you ever heard of the expression ""fire and forget""? That's right. Nothing to set, all games work, glide and Direct3D supported. This 3d card is great. Just install it in the AGP slot, attach the power source, turn on the computer and you are there. Software installation is the easiest.How does it work with 3d games? Read the title! :) Clockwork. It is perfect. No game will give you one single complaint about it. NFS IV does not list it as supported, but believe me, it works perfectly. I play NFS with the highest video settings and it runs smooth (have in mind I own an Athlon processor 650 MHz with 128 MB).Despite its incredible and flawless performance, there is a problem: When I installed it, I had to move one of my hard drives because this card is so big it wouldn't fit with the hard drive in its original position. Therefore, you might need to upgrade your box before installing, but hey! it is totally worth it. The best of its kind."
3,Average graphic card,"The most original feature of this board is its hardware full screen anti-aliasing (FSAA). That's the reason that made me buy this card. A great feature, but unfortunately the penalty in frame rates can be important, making it useless on demanding games. The 32 bit colors and large textures support were implemented in most video cards one year ago, and the absence of hardware T&L support will probably be a handicap in a near future. The image quality of the V5 is much better than the previous V3, but in my opinion not as good as nVidia's GeForce, which has deeper, richer colors. My main concern is the speed of this card, which is far from impressive. In a game like Kiss Psychocircus for instance, framerates often drop dramatically, even with a fast processor (Athlon 800 mhz). Overall I think that this is a good card, but it just can't compete with the technology of nVidia or ATI Radeon boards."
5,X Marks The Spot,"X marks the spot where powerful big-band swing meets soaring bebop. Arguably the best CD I own. Thrilling, swinging, dissonant, layered music gives off the pulse-pounding spontaneity of a live session and the precision of great studio musicians. Listen to a great ""Night in Tunisia."" ""I REmember Clifford."" Dizzy's own composition ""Tour de Force"" alone is worth the price of entry. This performance lifts you out of your chair. It adds twenty years to your life. Charli Persip drums for all time. But to single him out is a disservice to everyone else in the orchestra. 5 Stars. 6 if they were available!"
3,Not happy with Amazon,"The book came in good condition but no dust jacket.I had such a time trying to order the books with Amazon and I had a gift certificate that I had to back out a couple of times with not knowing what was going on with trying to order.With all the problems I changed my order and ended up ordering the same book from another place and ended up with duplicates which really upset me.The one time I went in and had my order done and was suppose to get free shipping and showed that I was to pay $5.97 in shipping............so I backed out.It was such an upsetting time and all the problems I had with ordering with the gift cert., credit card and shipping that I am not ordering from Amazon again and I am also canceling my Chase.amazon credit card. It was too much of a headachne.Ethel"
4,Good over all,"I liked the book overall. The only problem with this is that the strings are not as rigid as you would find them on a regular shoe, so the ""loops"" often flop over. It also only teaches one method, with making two loops, instead of one. My daughter had a hard time holding the ""flopped over"" loop to make the other loop, so I ended up teaching her the other way to tie the shoe and having the laces to practice on. It took about a day for her to learn. Over all, if your willing to spend about an hour or two with your child, it's worth the buy."
1,awful,i'm sure this would have been a very helpful book if i had ever received but i never did and i had to contact amazon for a full refund on my product.
2,Not for us old-timers,"I purchased this book for my Autistic son so he could learn to tie his shoes. For those of us who use a different method other than the one taught in this book (two loops) I think it's too difficult. Now my son insists that I tie his shoes ""Red Lace, Yellow Lace"" and it takes me at least 5x longer than the way I was taught.I also think it's too difficult for any child under the age of 7. The coordination that is needed is just too complicated, especially for children who are lacking fine-motor skills."
3,"Great idea, frustrating method","Like others, my son found it really aggravating trying the bunny ears method of tying. It's the complete inability of kids to get one loop made, hold it, and then get the other loop made while still holding the first one! Ergh."
3,Different method of tying laces,I thought this book would be great and it was in a way BUT it shows a different method of tying than I use so we both had to learn.
3,"Teaches ""rabbit ears"" method!","I was disappointed with this book and returned it. It teaches tying laces by making two loops and tying the loops together. I was looking for a book that taught the ""one-loop, wrap around, push through"" method.On the plus side, it is a very sturdy book that would take much abuse from a small child."
4,This book depicted The Civil War well,"Jubliee, was a great histroical fiction book that described history well. The books characters have realistic lives that are told well. the book takes place ona plantation then in war then ends the book in one of the characters houses. It's a great book i recomend it."
5,A Book That Should Be Required Reading For All,"Jubilee! by Margaret Walker is simply a great book. Well written with character, heart and honesty. Jubilee should be a must read for all high school students. It taught me what slavery was really like. How brutal and cruel our society was and maybe still is toward people of color. Again, a must read."
2,A 3M scam,"The unit works great on dust, pollen and pet hair. Can be noisy on high speed. Filters go fast if a smoker is in your house. After a short time it blows out ash tray smelling air. The product was relatively inexpensive $120 or so but 3M is reaping a windfall with the high price of their filters. I can't find them anywhere but on line at an outrageous price. I also have an Oreck electrostatic unit, you just clean the metal filter case. Never have to buy filters. It cost 3-4 times more but never have to buy a terribly overpriced filter. Shame on you 3M."
2,Developed a bearing noise -- 3M not interested in fixing it,"I purchased two of these a couple of years ago from woot.One of them works fine, but the other has some sort of motor noise. It spends all day going ""click, click, click, ...""I called 3M and since it is out of warranty, they have absolutely no interest in helping to fix or repair it."
3,spelling mistakes galore,The Golden Fox had so many spelling mistakes it was annoying to read. A good read but when reading I don't want words that are misspelt.
4,Great read but flawed,"I agree with many of the comments already made. This is an exciting, readable book but the central premise is flawed. Given how close Bella is to her family and how unrebellious she appears, it seemed totally out of character for her to betray her country and family in this way. Also I found the rescue far-fetched. Smith has written many better books (personally I prefer his non-Courtney books anyway) but I think if you like action and family drama this will still prove difficult to put down."
2,Not like Smith,"This book is nothing like Wilburth Smith.The story has no secuence with his previous work on the Courtney series.Compared with the masterly way in wich Smith weaves history and fiction in the Power of the Sword (giving a clear picture of South Africa during WW2 and the Apartheid}, or the narrative power of Burning Shore this books is a complete nothingness.So don't judge Smith by this, his least fortunate book."
2,Dissapointing,"I really like all the Wilbur smiths books i have read except the 7th scroll. And even that was much more readable than this. Wilbur Smith writes yarns so I am not looking for a plausible storyline but this just reeks of a childish romance novel. the first 100-150 pages of this novel are so unremarkable that I had completely forgoten I had read this book before untl the entrance of the inimitable character of Centaine. Sasha just seems a shadow of his former self. As someone who likes this author(River God, Warlock, Monsoon, Birds of Prey, The Delta Decision, Rage are all incredible books), I would like to advise new readers, please dont form opinions based on this. Everyone is entitiled to a bad book."
4,Douglas Toys Tender Teddy Musical Bear was delightful,It is really HARD to find wind up musical teddies now a days! So glad to have found this one! Wish they were bigger and came in the traditional brown fur coloring.
5,Finally!!!,"OMG!!! Finally The New Kids get the DVD treatment. I've been waiting for this to come out forever it seems like. All I have to say is if you've never seen this movie buy it anyway. Trust me if your an 80's fan you'll love this hidden gem. I highly recommend it if your a James Spader fan also.Here's a short description of the movie from IMDB:A brother and sister arrive in a small town to help their relatives run an amusement park, and they find the town is terrorized by a local street gang.Cast:Shannon Presby .... Loren McWilliamsLori Loughlin .... Abby McWilliamsJames Spader .... Eddie DutraEric Stoltz .... Mark"
4,"good blend of music, campy-ness, and storyline",a couple of posters have made comparison to rocky horror. thought this movie was better. alice cooper is on-screen for more than just a cameo and adds something to the mix. also a good performance by malcolm mcdowell as the vampire hunter. this is one of those movies that people have barely heard about now but will gain momentum as time passes. it's on my halloween shelf to watch yearly at this point.
5,It was the best!,This is the best cd player you could ever have.Iv had one for a year and their where no problems at all
3,An OK player that has some flaws...,"I bought this player a long time ago; it served me well but there were a few noticable flaws. Cheap headphones broke rather too soon. The most frastrating, however, is trying to forward the tracks (FF button activates programming mode) and turn the player off without taking the CD out (double cliking the stop button turns the player off about one it ten attempts). The batteries also are used up rather quickly. If you use it sparingly, it will do, but if you are a hardcore music lover - settle for something more expensive."
5,a wonderful kiri,This cd is full of surprises. Kiri's voice is a bit worn but still as mesmerizing as ever.
2,Kiri Sings karl,Kiri sings opera would have been a more telling title for those of us who are unfamiliar with Kiri and who enjoy Karl. I am not an opera fan.
3,"Entertaining, but not what I expected","This is an entertaining book, but somehow I thought the stories would be about families, and the times that came before."
3,Heavy,"The lens quality itself is good, but it is so heavy (for me anyway) that I can't take a decent picture unless I'm using a tripod. So I don't think I will be using it nearly as much as I expected."
4,Canon Telephone Lens,This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my son. Based on recommendations from friends this was the lens to purchase for the type of application for use. It was reasonably priced verses other websites. It is easy to attach and for the recreational photographer it is an excellent buy!
4,good lense overall,"i've been using this lense now for about a month and a half and i really enjoy it. the 300mm gives a good reach, but i still prefer to stay in the 70-200mm zoom if i can help it. the image quality is nice, but i recomend a tripod to be used with it, unless its a really bright day. the first thing i noticed out of the box is that the focus ring and barrel have a little bit of play in them. at first i was concerned but then i went to a local camera shop and looked at another version of the lense right out of the box, and it was the same. the person working there also told me that the focus ring is that way due to the USM gears and how they work. the only other complaint i have is that the barrel extends when zooming, and that will cause you to have to refocus and watch where you're swinging that huge lense lol! other than that it's great and i don't have buyers remorse. it was a good purchase!"
1,No good.,I returned this lens after 3 days. Autofocus searched forever in moderate low light. The IS was extremely loud. The images were not of any significant quality worth tolerating either issue. Save some money buy an L series.
5,Exactly what I wanted,The lens is exactly what I wanted. Image stabilizer is great and it is so easy to change the lens. Pics are great!
5,excellent,"very good lens. slow to focus in low light, but that's really no big deal.I would definately recommend this lens for the price."
1,Poor Choice,"I read every review and test I could find while deciding between this lens and the 70-200 f4 L. In the end, I opted for stabilization and reach - big mistake. Sharpness and color are poor on this lens and it can be very frustrating when you review your photos at the end of a trek and toss, literally, all of them. I sold this lens at significant loss and bought a used 70-200 f2.8 L (non IS). The difference was stunning. There is a reason the f4 is best in its class, don't make my mistake. You can easily crop your super sharp photos to match the reach of the 70-300. I've since bought a used 400mm f5.6 L - even at f5.6 the L glass is so superior to other products that it is easily hand-holdable (this lens is non IS) in all but the lowest light. Additionally, the L lenses are built like tanks! The f4 L will not dissapoint, buy it."
2,heavy cream or half and half,"At this point in Becks catalog, he is about half good half bad. This stuff tips the scale even. It seems Beck is no longer able or willing to write a great song. Where he once led he now follows, but thats ok. No artist hits the mark everytime out, and they need room to try new things. I knew from day one this guy would have a long career with many songs in him. I don't think he's dried out, but if he is I believe he has a well somewhere that he can dip into. Like Dylan. Sometimes the best thing for a songwriter is to become irrelevant and slip under the radar. As it stands with this release regardless how many drones will buy it, Beck is on his way to obscurity and when he gets there and looks around he may find it suits him fine. Better things to come."
3,just ok,"Wes plays good on this recording, but it is far from his best work. I like to buy all the recordings from an artist I like. If you're like me, save buying this cd until last. It is just so (...) compared to most of his other work. If you have all the other Wes recordings, then get this one. Why not. All Wes recordings have their good points and this one is no exception."
5,Jeremy Camp is awesome,I love this guy. He is an amazing singer. I have all three of his cds and I can't wait for more.
2,Boring Lyrics and Run of the Mill Music,"I hunger for worship music that brings tears to the eyes. Newsboys, MW Smith, and PhilipsCraig&Dean do this for me. After my daughter's recommendation and the reviews on this page, I bought this album yesterday 08102004. I was sadly disappointed. The lyrics are repetitive. The songs that don't have enough rhythm to merit the use of drums HAVE drums. Pointless. This album drags. I wish I could return used albums. This is the last time I buy any album based on reviews and recommendations. I will ALWAYS listen before I buy. Where is the latest Newsboys album? I want THAT one."
5,What an awesome CD!,"This is such a great CD. It is one of my favorites. I study, drive, jog, etc., to this CD all the time. Both ""One Day At A Time"" and ""Take My Life"" are equally good. Stil, my favorite track is ""Right Here."" This song alone really touched me so much, especially at times when it feels like family and friends are so far away (physically). Listening to any of Jeremy Camp's lyrics shows that he is obviously God-inspired, and I'm sure if you choose to buy this CD, you will be blessed with it as much as I am."
3,Not one of Coleman's best bands,"The freedom in Ornette Coleman's music is very demanding of the musicians he plays with. Not technically demanding, necessarily, but in terms of creativity. His classic quartet was able to rise to this challenge brilliantly, as were the classic Prime Time lineups of the 80s. This version of Prime Time is not quite up to the same standard, and the result (other than Ornette's own melodies) is often uninspired. Like Jerry Garcia on ""Virgin Beauty"", the band too often seems to be just meandering as they try to follow the leader."
1,Some of the parts were broken,The plastic part that connect the deferent nozzles was broken when I open the package. And to send this back is to much of an effort.
3,Confusing,"I guess the content is still good considering that it is Clausewitz. I thought that it was confusing to figure out whether the content was Clausewitz' words or the author. I guess I was also looking for more explicit applications of Clausewitz theory. To be honest, I learned more about Clausewitz reading Colin Powell's biography than reading this book. There is still lots of good stuff in this book though if you can buy it for cheap."
2,basic case,"This is the basic ""attach to your belt"" case for a palm treo shaped device.One complaint is that it can come off your belt fairly easily. My palm has not yet broken when this happens, nor has it dropped into water or snow. But the potential is there. So you need to be careful when wearing it.The second complaint is that the case provides no protection for your stylus. My stylus has fell from the palm several times now. So far it fell in my home or office, where I later located it. But eventually it will fall while ""out in the world"" and that will be it.For the price paid, not bad. But it's nothing special."
4,Treo 650 Carrier,I am very pleased with my Treo holder. It clips securely to my belt and my phone is easily accessible.
3,Chicks do early Alice in Chains,"Nothing too original here, but I do kinda like the music, since I like the genre. BUT, its just chicks doing early Alice in Chains like their albums Facelift and Dirt. If you like those and you like hot Swedish chicks, then get it."
2,What a decline from an impressive debut,"What happened? ""Horror Wrestling"" was so good....but now this?It's not to say that the album was horrible, but, for the most part, it was same repetitive mid-tempo mush over and over and over again. Gone are the cool dynamic and tempo changes...and the lyrics, while a little better English-wise, just didn't pack the same punch.Very much a let-down. There's really only one song I found interesting - ""Enter My Mind."" Others, such as ""Simon Says,"" either bored or annoyed me.I'll get their next album, but it had better be an improvement....which, considering the level of this effort, really isn't saying much."
3,"Great game, but PSP hangs during play!","I would love nothing more than to play this game, and I have really tried - about 6 hours total so far, but it's gotten to that point that it's almost too frustrating. The constant pauses to load data from the disk make this all but unplayable. The social games, which were a great idea, hang so badly that if you push a button while it's loading, it doesn't register and you LOSE the game! You literally can't make a move without 3-10 second hangs while the data loads, and sorry EA, you should have fixed that one. A game is only fun if it's not fighting with its platform.What makes this sadder is how much FUN this game would have been. 5 stars all the way! The graphics are incredible, the story is fresh, and the game play inventive and addictive. Seriously, EA, what happened? Didn't you test this one out on the hardware?"
1,This is 2008 technology??,"Unless you have a LOT of time on your hands for waiting, and enjoy looking at hourglasses, say, every minute, don't bother. Very disappointed in this product. As was mentioned in another review, this system is not cheap. Shame on the creators for slapping this together. What is even more frustrating is it COULD have been a good game."
2,"Very fun, very slow.","Now, don't get me wrong. This is coming from a HUGE Sims fan. I think the gameplay in this game is very much fun, and the graphics are very good. I CAN'T stand the loading times. I think they should have gotten some of the bugs out before selling it. Oh, well, still an OK game. ;)."
2,Good Graphics. Poor Loading.,"Well, what can I say..The graphics rocks but the loading and length of game play is really a disappointment. I have already played this game through. I probably would've finished it in about a few days but the wait is what made the game seem so long. There weren't much missions fullfill and for some strange reason this game will make your psp shut off. I've never had this problem w/ my other games for psp. If I were you, I wouldn't really waste my money on this game..It's not worth it. I'm planning to sell mine back to the store I bought it from or swap it w/ the ds version."
5,simply brilliant,"I love this book. Where else can you expand your vocabulary, learn and retain new kanji, and develop your reading skills, all while reading a truly kick-ass story? And believe me, the stories are great. You've got ""Dreams"", a sometimes macabre, sometimes funny exercise in surrealism. There's ""In a Grove"", a page-turner of a murder mystery. My favorite is ""Rashomon"", which surprised me with its black humor.I also love the fact that the book is so compact. You can read it on the train (as I do) without announcing to the world that that you're another gaijin trying to learn Japanese. This is a tool whose value far outweighs its price."
3,Old favorite.,"Only just started this book, but know what it's all about. Will enjoy it I am sure as I read on."
2,Endless and useless,"Ok, so I'll say it. I hated the movie Gone with the Wind. But, in an effort to be fair, I decided to read the book. I thought maybe it was something about the production that I didn't like. But, no, the book has many of the same problems.Reasons to Hate GWTW:1)It's endless for one, just like the movie. Over a thousand pages and a large bit of it is completely unecessary.2) Rhett - I don't care what anyone says, he wasn't handsome, he wasn't romantic, and there wasn't much to like about him.3) Scarlett - I've never seen a more annoying female lead. And everyone says, ""oh she grows up in the end! she stops being selfish!"" She doesn't.4) If you don't like the two main characters, what's the point?Needless to say, it was a waste of money for me and I gave my copy to a friend who loves the movie. At least she'll enjoy it."
2,Good Writing Lousy History,"GONE WITH THE WIND is a book that deserved to win the Pulitzer prize for its well developed Characters and fine writing but PLEASE don't buy it as history.I see no reason to call the Atlanta citizens ""rare courage"" unless you mean half baked!The slaves -- yes for what they endured.The Union troops (Black and White) fighting to preserve the Union IN FREEDOM and President Lincoln who went through hell for the nation but NOT the Confederates who were only seeking their own advantage and trying to tear our nation apart to establish a slave empire.Sorry but facts are facts."
5,Too good for words,I really can't describe how I feel about this book and about Scarlett. She is a character without parallel. You can't help admiring her even when you deplore her for her failings. Amazing.
4,"Long, but worth it.","Not only is this book very moving, but it is one of the most popular historicals ever. Albeit, I did think it was long and I sometimes got tired of reading about struggle after struggle and pain over and over, this is the kind of book that shows the strength of people. When you get done with this book, it will leave you satisfied."
5,Gone with the wind,My favorite book of all times. The description of the civil war helped me get a feel for what happened during those terrible times.
5,Gone With the Wind,"I have read this book several times and it never dissappoints. The main characters; Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, Ashley, Mammy along with others to numerous to mention are vivid in the minds eye. You are swept up by the turmoil the South suffered during the Civil War and Reconstruction. Ultimately, it is the love story of all time. A must read!"
5,An all time classic,I have read this book three times and each time it gets better and better. Our book group enjoyed it too.
5,"Truly a magnificent work of art, from all points of view!","Being a freshman in high school, my opinions are not usually taken for notice, however, I challenged myself in reading this book and found myself all the stronger a person for it. It truly gives the Southern point of view like nothing lese described to us Yankees. Amazing!"
5,Where's Rhett??,"I have read this many times, and love it better every time. Rhett Butler was my first love ever, thanks to Margaret Mitchell. I still have a little crush on him. She made the characters so real that I feel like I grew up knowing them as my friends"
5,Great Service,"The book matched the picture on the site, which was important to me. It was delivered as described and on time."
5,great,"Ok, here's the deal. This book was great. I mean GREAT! I read it in 6th grade. The whole thing was so, so, so wonderful! I luved every bit of it, Except for.....the end. I hated the end! Why did she just leave us hanging? I mean Tomorrow everything will be alright? What kind of ending is that? So I had to get Scarlett. I luved Scarlett too. And I was glad that there was actually an ending, but the ending was kind of boring."
5,Old Favorite,"This is a new copy of an old favorite that I read to death. Have not read this one yet, but, I am sure that I will enjoy it as much as the other one."
5,"Fantastic, drips with passion and loss.","What can you say about this novel? The prose evokes comparison to Edith Wharton's. The characters live and breathe before you on the page. The setting is set in intimate detail, and it swirls in your mind's eye as you drink in the words. Amazing novel. Scarlett seems much stronger in literature than her flighty character in the film. Once I could escape my preconceived notion of the characters taken from the film, the book became pure joy to read."
5,"a terrific book for anyone,regardless of ages","Gone With The Wind is a great book,about a young girl, Scarlett, who is a terrible flirt. I read it this summer and I'm only nine, the context wasn't too challenging. M.M. wove the story plot extremely well,it kept me in suspense until the very end, and I want to read the sequal. All in all , if I could, I would give this book infinity stars."
5,"absolutely, the best book ever written.","I have read this book at least 10 times. I am never bored or figedty when I'm reading GWTW. I love the movie too. I have made my family watch it so many times that my 18year old daughter is now a GWTW fan, too!"
5,One of the best books ever!,"This probabaly has to be the best book ever written. Mitchell did a great job on the plot, characters, everything! What she did the best on was the characters. Those were definetly three dimentional characters. When you are done you think that there is no way that this is fiction because Scarlett, Rhett, and everybody seem so real. You also come to like Scarlett because with all her faults, she is still a brave and strong character. Trust me, don't be intimadated by its size. It will probably be the best book you ever read."
1,Useless soap opera,"Hell, I just wasted the better part of my Sunday reading the last couple of hundred pages of this trash, always in the hope that somewhere, there had to be this twist which would make the book worth reading, but it just never came. I ended flinging the book across the room, disgusted. Character, heroism, intelligence, thoughtfulness? Things Scarlett certainly lacks can all be found in books like Inception (Harbinson) or even better: A Town like Alice (Shute). Please don't waste your time as I did...."
1,"Frankly, I don't give a damn.","My father browbeat me into reading Gone With The Wind when I was a teenager. To this day I can't understand what all the fuss was about. Scarlet is such a spoilt snit that I couldn't care what happened to her. I guess this is one book you either love or hate, so I recommend that you check a volume out of the library and read a chapter or two. If you hate it, you've lost nothing but a little of your time. If you love it, well, there's no accounting for taste."
5,Absolutely one of the best books ever written...,"I read this book for the first time when I was 14 and I havebeen in love with it ever since. Scarlett was desperate for love, butwas looking in all the wrong places. She loved Rhett, but was too determined to make it in the world without him in an era that frowned on women behaving in that manner. In the end, she only defeated her own purpose; she had plenty of money, but no love. The characters in this book were written with such vivid color that they will live forever, whether in print or on screen."
2,The Book is Better than the Movie,"Let yourself get lost in Atlanta with the characters of Gone With the Wind. You'll yearn for a sequal. If you've seen the movie, you've really seen a different story that what you'll find in the book."
4,pretty good,"I read it when I was 11 and my opinion was, and still is, ""pretty good, for a romance."" But it's probably just me, because I'm more into science fiction and mythology. bit of a difference, isn't it? P.S.- if you really liked GWTW, don't read the sequel, _Scarlett_. I'll tell you, it's pretty different from what I imagined."
5,Masterpiece,"I love this book. I love these characters. I love how it's 1,000 pages long, so you don't have to leave the amazing world depicted too soon. I love how you can curl up with this book and read it for hours on end and never come to the last page. It's so completely absorbing, so real and life-like, so undeniably painted, that it's more than classic. It's a masterpiece. I asked for this book for my Confirmation present, and I will cherish it and show it to my children and my children's children. I hope to God that this book is never forgotten. It is simply beautiful and romantic."
5,Nicely Printed Classic,"This copy is pretty much what the First Edition looked like in 1936 and it's easy to see how it got to be so big. Not until The Godfather was published had there been so much interest in a book and its inevitable film version. Impresses to this day and you can see the masterwork the film's screenwriters performed in getting this sprawling story onto the screen. I think every American should read this through at least once.God help the pukes making movies in this era who think they need to ""reboot"" this story... Also, don't bother with the ""authorized"" sequels; the story stands on its own."
4,Great book!,I ordered this book due to the fact that my other one got destroyed....little siblings lol. The book cover is different from the one in the picture. The pic showed a blue cover with a gold like color for the title. The cover on the book I now have is of a man (Rhett) holding a women (Scarlett in his arms.. The book arrived a few weeks after having ordered it but thats ok. I wasn't about to allow my bookshelf to live out its life w/o having one of America's best classics on it. The book arrived in good condition and Im happy:)
5,The Greatest Romance Novel of All Time,"Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind is my absolute favorite book. I enjoy books that have deeper meaning and make you think, but although this book lacks one it's a masterpiece all the same. Read it for the story and lose yourself in the Old South. P.S. The movie was great, but the book goes into much more detail and causes one to be much more drawn to the heroine."
3,Book Missing a Page,"The book was excellent, however it was missing page 713. It had page 813 in its place. Therefore the book had page 813 displayed twice in the book. I also went to a local bookstore and noticed all 4 books by this publisher had the same problem."
2,It Was Torn!,I received the book on time but the back cover was torn at the binding 1/2 way down! I was not impressed with that at all.
4,Very nice album,Its a shame that Ace is putting it up after this album. One of his best albums is also his last. Go grab this album and add to the collection of hip hop. Top 3 album of 2004. Straight classic.
5,"Perfect Album, Classic!!!","Everything about these album is Amazing. Great beats, amazing lyrics, and funny skits. What else do you want? Every since I bought this CD I have not put it down. If you are looking for something new, check out this album. If you have never herd of Masta Ace, don't be shy to BUY this album. There are no bad tracks, when you play it through, it tells a story. One of my favorites of all time no doubt."
3,A little dissapointed,"The album is complete, cd, case - everything is in a good condition. Sadly, there's no booklet. If I knew this before i wouldn't buy this album :/"
1,"Horrible, ruined hairdryer and burnt hair",I used this in the UK running 240 volts for my 1600 watt US hairdryer. The heating element turned to toast and burnt my hair.
5,Swingin' with Stan and Oscar,"This album is the gold standard for modern lyrical saxophone playing. For heaven's sake, it's Oscar and Stan!!!! Just buy it!!!"
2,Scent,"I wish I could use this lotion, but the smell makes me nauseous. I don't know what it is; the smell is just awful. It's not strong or anything, just has a sickly odor to it..."
4,Spoiled little girl with a sense of entitlement,"The first part of this book depicts a spoiled little girl with a sense of entitlement who didn't (and still doesn't) know how good she had it! The couple who adopted her were fabulous parents. They were good to her beyond all measure and loved her unconditionally. Unfortunately, Sarah has never been able to accept that love, let alone return any of it. The story she tells, however, of the search for her birth parents becomes more and more fascinating as the pages turn..... It is quite a story, and by the end of the book I felt that she had come to terms with who these people were and are, but the adoptive parents are still out there someplace, wondering what happened to the little girl they adopted and loved. Sad story."
3,Acceptable beginners guide to astrology.,"Very easy to read and entertaining book about the compatibility between sun signs on a basic level. However, the book earns demerit points because some of the jibes at sun signs are too cruel (especially for Scorpio). Teri King is a Gemini so they come off pretty well!! Also, unlike Linda Goodman, the book seems unduly pessimistic about some combinations and needs to be more positive and helpful. Perhaps she's just wanting to call a spade a spade but in this Aquarian age of brotherhood....hmmmm."
4,A great improvement!,"""Highland Call"" is a magnificent improvement over Gillenwater's previous book, ""Song of the Highlands""! To be honest, after reading the first novel, I would NOT have even considered reading the second, except for the fact that I had already bought the second before even reading the first (I get a little over-zealous with my book purchasing sometimes ;). Almost immediately after beginning Highland Call, I was totally amazed at what I found - Gillenwater had learned to create true depth in her characters in a way that was lacking before, causing you to really care for them! She had learned to write dialogue and details in a much more realistic and interesting way! The previous book was so cheesy I could hardly stand it, but Highland Call was a book I truly enjoyed reading, and even learning from. After finishing it I found myself thinking about the characters from time to time, and wishing that there was more to read about them - which to me is a definite sign of a good book!"
3,Quite Useful,"A good workbook for learning Kanji. It shows each character, what it means, and how to draw it. I wish it would have the meaning of each character written in Romagi as well, I found myself adding that myself, but that's not a big deal. My only serious complaint is regarding the last half of the book which is for practicing drawing the characters. There is no suggestion as to how this section should be used. A character or two to copy from on each page would have helped tremendously. As it is there isn't even a single line suggesting how to use the section effectively, just 50 pages of graph paper. You can flip back and fourth between the page in the front displaying the character you want to learn and the back where you try to draw it, but this is extremely awkward. Especially for someone who is left handed such as myself. I ended up practicing each character on the page describing it."
2,Poor Bela...,"Quick word association. What spings to mind when you hear ""The Ape Man""? Didja think Bigfoot? The neanderthal from the Geico commercials? How about the fallen stars of Bela Lugosi and Wallace Ford on full display, preserved for posterity? Because that is exactly what the appeal of this film boils down to. See the great Count reduced to knuckledragging around in furry makeup. Squirm uncomfortably as he digs the needle into his vein. Bela has such an irrepressible *presence* that even his lesser works are worth at least a look. And a depressed sigh. The print used seems to have been run over by a cement truck. And possibly drug behind it. The sound is so lousy that about half the dialogue is unintelligable. Perhaps, dear readers, that's for the best...just mute the television and imagine your own story to go along with the images. Chances are, you'll do a better job."
5,Galco mag holster,"very good product. very secure and adjustments work well. the color matches my belt very well and along with galco's belt and concealable holster, the entire package is very good."
4,Reasonably Good account of the Fischer-Spassky clash,"Although I found this to be a good account of the Fischer-Spassky clash, as well as the two chess champions themselves, I thought there was too much factual information around the chess match. At times, this made for difficult reading. I would have preferred to read more about the chess than the political aspects, although I guess the focus of the book was the political impact that this particular chess match had on the USA and the USSR.For me, it was still a fascinating account of the minds of world class chess players, their fickleness, their child-like behaviour, their paranoia, but above all, their genius. It was amazing to see how the political element bowed to Fischer.It was sad to read that Fischer never really defended his World Championship title officially, as he is arguably regarded as the greatest chess genius of all."
3,Interesting And Different,"After reading reviews for this band I thought I would purchase the Retrospective Cd so I could get a good sample of the music. The music is kind of boring. Each song songs a lot like the previous one.Vocals are a bit bland. My best guess is this is a band you need to see live before you can enjoy the recorded music. I am sure this band is talented but just a little to plain for me. No offense to anyone, just my opinion."
4,Useful and quick lookups,"Beware, the author warns. This is not a book to learn CSS from scratch. Its premise is that you already have a basic understanding of CSS and of the rudiments of JavaScript. But given that, Schmitt offers a handy grab bag of time saving hacks, that others have found useful when struggling with CSS.Some of the problems and solutions do seem really basic. Like the very first one, about setting the typeface of some text in a page. You'd expect any book teaching CSS to cover this, or, if not, that a user who read that book could quickly find this solution. A few other problems are like this.But the majority of problems presented here are not so trivial. That, combined with a succinct set of one liners that describe each problem in the contents, should give the book some appeal to you."
5,Greatness,"Seven Samurai is a definite must for anyone would likes Japanese Origins in anyway what so ever, or just a flat out good movie. Sure its really old and kinda hard to get into because of that but its still really great once you give it a chance. For a movie that is over 50 years old the action is pretty good. Its a must see unless your one of those people who is not the slightest bit open and cant watch anything old or anything thats not all action..that kind of stupid stuff. Just see it =)"
5,Jerry's review,I would like to give Jerry's review five stars. Haven't read such an entertaining review before. Rock on Jerry.
5,Why do I hallucinate?,"Having remembered seeing the movie in Japan in widescreen format, I was mortified to find that that option was not available to me in this edition...Then I heard that the movie was never actually IN widescreen format to begin with ...oops...Don't know WHY I had some hallucination that I'd seen it letterboxed...Anyway, every human being should see The Seven Samurai and if you haven't, what are you waiting for? This and Yojimbo are two of Kurosawa's most crowd-pleasing entries..."
5,One of the best ever,"This epic adventure is the back bone of many modern themes (Magificent Seven and others). A long movie that really don't seem to mind, this movie is one of the best foriegn films ever produced. Hats off to the Toho Corporation for this masterpiece. This is a must have title for any collection and having it on DVD ensures that it will won't wear out before many more generations can enjoy this movie. It seems a little hard to believe that the company that produced Godzilla started out with this movie."
2,all time great film killed by the 1.33:1 aspect ratio,"This Master work by Kurosawa is butchered to fit into the consumer TV screen. Imagine cuting out half the image of the Mona Lisa, how would you like that. A definate must own but only if it the full aspect ratio. just say no to 1.33:1, the more we resist it the better off we'll all be."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though at 200+ minutes the movie is far too long, The Seven Samurai is well made and culminates in a skillfully directed battle scene; patient viewers may find much to treasure, but dillietantes should probably look elsewhere."
5,Excellent makeover for a masterpiece,"Many of the other reviews have summarized Akira Kurosawa's excellent film, so I won't recap it since you are probably familiar with The Seven Samurai.Rather, if you are concerned about shelling out the money for this edition when you already have the earlier release, rest easy. It is well worth the price. Having seen the movie many, many times, I was shocked at how the upgraded footage made scenes seem new and brought out many details I had missed. The supplemental materials: commentaries, documentaries, interviews, and the booklet (with reminiscences from Mifune Toshiro) complement the movie nicely.If you are on the fence, go ahead and buy it. This DVD is worth it!"
4,Item Review,"I love this movie and this would have been a 5 star if not for the misconception of it also having an English audio, which it does not. It has English COMMENTARY under Audio. Still has English subtitles and worth the money."
5,Best Japanese Movie Ever Made!,"If you hate black and white movies with subtitles, think again. One night when I was sleeping at my friend's house he asked me that since I love Japanese history if I wanted to watch The Seven Samurai. Like any teen being asked to watch a three and a half hour long foreign black and white film I didn't expect to like it. I watched it and was instantly amazed at the quality of this masterpiece. This movie is well written, well acted and is highly entertaining. Surprisingly it will even make you laugh and it isn't at corny acting. For anyone who hates black and white movies with subtitles, watch this and it will change your mind. So if you like Japanese history and swords then I would highly recommend this work of art."
4,What about widescreen?,I would give this movie 5 stars (it deserves it!) but I was disappointed that it's only full screen and NOT letterbox or widescreen. Why not?
3,Victorinox MiniChamp Knife - quality disappointment,"As received in original packaging, knife case had several visible mars and scuffs. Vendor provided a replacement at no cost, but it also had minor surface marring. Surprised that knife did not arrive in pristine condition, and that it is so susceptible to marking in the box. Sent notice to Victorinox via their web site, but received no response."
5,A Great Phone for a Tiny Price,"If you remember the old days when the amount of money you paid for your cordless phone was directly proportional to quality of that phone, here's some good news for you ! This is a great cordless phone for the money.Charges like a champ, good sound quality, and great performance no matter how far away it is from the base station, this phone will pleasantly surprise you.I bought this phone to use with Magic Jack in case MJ was a disappointment. Magic Jack is a great and so's the phone !"
2,"As a teacher, I found the ""sports coach"" tone distracting.","There are already dozens of creative writing ""how to"" books on the market...Why make a student spend this much for a book that's overloaded and at times condescending."
4,Santa Fe Trail,I enjoyed the movie. Quiet honestly I thught it was a western. Disappointed when I realized it was about the Civil War & John Brown.
1,Sorry Errol,"If you're an Errol FLynn fan let me warn you, Flynn hardly ever even gets to touch a sword in this film! He's very cramped in this roll; and even much of his ordinary charm, doesn't come through."
2,Santa Fe Trail,"Great old picture, but not restored in any way, and very poor quality picture! I enjoyed it anyway. It was a classic of the movie industry!"
3,not history at all but it's fun....,"It's not history but it's fun and has a great cast. The dvd could be alot better though. The story is about custer and others chasing down John Brown, who tried to start the civil war on his own to free the slaves. And he's a hero for it in my opinion but that's not the message here. It's a action flick really and a western buddy flick. It's a likeable movie and that's enough for a good viewing. Errol Flynn is excellent of course and he was a very good actor. Raymond massey was a great one and he is just a great John Brown. The movie does need to be remastered though , A favorite film on tv channels for many decades , most kids would have seen this some saturday afternoon. This is worth owning but don't expect a great picture on this dvd that's why I only gave it three stars. It should have cleaned up more."
1,Santa Fuzzy,The movie is a classic. The print was very poor and I would not recommend to anyone purchasing.
1,Needs an update,"Though this video was technically good it was really ""dated"" and that made me loose enthusiasm. I wanted information on kitchens of today. It was mostly my fault. I should have looked at the publication date. Otherwise there were basic tips that really don't change I guess."
2,Not To Be Taken Too Seriously,"One thing this book does go to prove, is that even the most learned of linguistic scholars amongst us (re:the author) remains, as ever, ""divided"" by our common language.My tip to any American visitor to these shores would be not to take this book too seriously. Many of the phrases, expressions and translations offered are somewhat antiquated and dated. The section of this book providing most humour is where the authour offers advice to Britons in America, and what common British expressions we should not say whilst in the States. Thank you for the advice, but there are many phrases inlcuded that a Brit wouldn't use here either. Quite simply, I wouldn't be understood."
5,Some good research,"Most books give a good translation between British and American English, but this book goes into a little more detail on the oprigins and reasons for the differences."
1,Know the one about the infinite number of monkeys?,"{Give them an infinite number of typewriters and an infinite amount of time and eventually they'll produce the complete works of Shakespeare...} This ain't Shakespeare, but then again you wouldn't have to wait as long for it. The author could probably write some powerful poetry (I found some of the metaphorical images absolutely stunning) but the rare glimpse of brilliance in this almost random jumble of text only makes the lack of coherence even more frustrating. Unless you have an infinite amount of time to read an infinite number of books, avoid this one. On a scale of 1-5, it gets one banana."
1,"Too bad there's no ""zero stars""!","I think the review from ""island girl"" in Concord, MA says it all. Mossman is an INCREDIBLY bad writer. If a book quickly goes out of print and is never heard from again, there's probably a REASON! I disliked his writing style so much I couldn't get past page 10. What a bizarre disappointment after that terrific movie! For heaven's sake, don't buy this book -- try to get it from the library and see if you can stand even 20 pages!"
2,another glorified graduate school project,"when i was in graduate school, we had two phrases for this genre of ""experimental"" american novel: bloated and showoffy. in those days all you had to do was write down all the adjectives you could think of before noon and pass it off as avant-garde literature. stones of summer might have been fun to read for the sheer preening self-loathing of it all if not for the fact that it takes itself so seriously. lighten up mr. mossman! and grow up. every female character is a demeaning sixties cliche. i can't believe any woman would traul through this labored adolescent boy's fantasy."
2,The Literary Hoax of 2003,"Barnes and Nobles is perpetrating the greatest literary hoax in years and all at the expense of a very ordinary novel that should have stayed forgotten. I tried to cut through the thicket of verbiage, but the writing was so self-indulgent and adolescent that I stopped at page 75. Previous reviewers were on target about this book's mean, anti-woman slant. All the women are hideous caricatures: saints or street-walkers and often both. The author has the insights and prejudices of an unelightened 14 year old boy."
2,A total ripoff,"I'm one of those readers who bought into all the hype about this book. I plodded through the first 70 pages reading and rereading the pretentious stonecold 60s prose until like it almost made sense to me daddyo. You need to take magic mushrooms to grasp the pseudo profundities of this novel. Unfortunately I don't have any handy. The book is really maddening. It has no structure and no point other than the writer eventually goes nuts, probably because he's tried to rereard the novel himself and realized the hopelessness of it all. Stones of Summer is a big mud wallow of words that you can easy suffocate in. I feel I have been totally suckered by the hooptedoo surrounding this so called great lost masterpiece. No wonder Entertainment Weekly gave it a D-"
2,Summer Bummer,"This dense coming-of-age story follows Dawes Oldham Williams, a sensitive 8-year-old in 1950s Iowa who becomes a disillusioned adult in Mexico struggling to maintain his sanity. In 581 impenetrable pages, there's no shortage of lyrical exposition or monotonous pretension."
1,Stones of Suffering,"I too was caught in the web of hype that surrounding this lost work. Since I started this book back in November, I have suffered through it while hoping for some thread of a story with some thread of something interesting. Instead it is just one incoherant scene after another. At around halfway through, I had to bail out as it seemed to get worse.My advice is ""Don't waste your time with this!"" It was lost for a reason."
3,Great story and plot.,The story itself was pretty good. Many typo's and too many large words. Glad I had a dictionary built into my Kindle. If your looking for the down to earth readers then be simple. You will find there are more down to earth readers than there are highly educated ones.
4,The Last Trail,"Although I did enjoy the book I found it a little bit mushy for a western. The caracthers were well described as was the location in which the story took place. The scenic descriptions were awesome in detail, you can picture it in your mind. I would recommend it for an easy read."
3,if you had to read a western...,this was not my favorite-a louis l'amour i had to read in college was the only other western (besides romantic) i had read; and i liked l'amour better. but still a decent book.
1,The Last Trail to where?,I have never ordered this book and I have never received this book so how am I supposed to rate it?
5,Excellent Mopar Data Source,This is one of the best sources I've found for accurate data on 1962-1964 Mopar high performance cars. The photos and text are top notch. I couldn't be happier with this valuable historical document.
2,Very dry reading,"Didn't care for the book. It was very dry and hard to ""get into"". Wouldn't waste the money on the book."
5,Amazing; about so much more than just tea,"Tea, Zen Buddhism, flowers, Taoism, art, orientalism, and a relentless mocking of the Western world for its racism and absurd notion of exceptionaism. Brilliant. Absolutely adored it!"
1,Ok,Didn't really interest me enough to read mire than first couple of pages. Probably wouldn't buy again. To others though this could be their book.
4,The Book of Tea,The book gave a good history of the progression of tea through the ages. It was very interesting to learn of the three distinct ways tea was prepared.
5,"Finally, something unique.","This book is a fresh take on an often written-about subject. The use of replica tickets, programs and other nuggets of NASCAR history make for enjoyable sidetrips through the prose and photos. Lavishly produced, tightly written, this stands out from many other worthy efforts in recent years. Recommended highly."
2,"Had Fogel known how to write, you might've beleived him","Initially, the notion that chattel servitude/slavery would not have died on its own is a fascinating concept. Very quickly, however, the reader discovers that Fogel is so deeply wrapped up in his ideas that he fails to properly paint the picture of a strong southern society in which slavery was a blessing to Southern Blacks. The interest subsides as his poorly written and disorganized book turns into page after page of confusion. WARNING-- DO NOT ATTEMPT TO READ THE SECOND PART OF THIS WORK WHICH IS A DETAILED EXPLANATION OF METHODS, DETAILS, AND ANALYSIS. UNLESS YOU ARE A MONSTER MATHEMATICIAN OR A PSYCHOPATH, THIS SECOND VOLUME WILL BE A WASTE OF GOOD TIME AND MONEY"
3,"Good quality photos, poor Wi-Fi implementation","Camera is too large to be considered a true ""elph."" Doesn't look that attractive with the odd antenna off to the left side. Wi-Fi doesn't even work with Mac OSX so any Mac users out there may want to pass on this one. If you don't mind the slightly larger size, have a computer running Windows OS, and really want a Wi-Fi enabled digicam the sd430 may not be a bad choice (for the under $200.00 price tag)To me, however, the novelty of being able to transfer photos via an old standard (802.11 b) wireless protocol does not justify the larger size and awkwardness of this camera.***Update***While I did return this camera, a reviewer noted that with a firmware update, the camera will now work with the Mac. About time, Canon!"
3,Two Great Albums Have Finally Arrived,"An out of print CD for many years and it's finally nice to have it on CD. The sound quality is good for a 1972 album. Highlights include: Golden Lark, Serpent is Rising, and Man of Miracles. Rare but excellent Styx at its best..John, the drummer, will sadly be missed by all fans."
3,good but....,"This is some pretty rocking thrash like a lot of the recent stuff on sound pollution(Krigshot, Meanwhile, Y, maybe Hellnation) with a definite Mob 47 influence as well. It's definitely high in energy and pretty bruising, but it never really goes anywhere. The songs blend together and the album is very short. All in all pretty monotonous, but still decent thrashing hardcore."
5,What I wanted!,"Speedy service, love the product and I still have a TV where I have a vhs player. Great movie that I have always wanted to watch. Thank you."
2,Not for me,"Smells musty, Made me feel worse, product looked like a good representation of Cordyceps. I'm saying it not only does nothing for me after trying for only two day but makes me feel ill."
4,rare solo bud!,"Tracks 1-4 are with a trio, including Buddy Rich on drums, probably not the best choice to accompany Bud. Tracks 5-12 are solo, and these are terrific. They alone are worth the price."
2,Way over-hyped ...,"If John Q-Nobody were to submit this manuscript to a publisher today, I doubt that it would make it out of the slush pile. The best parts of the book were Steinbeck's descriptions of flowers, rocks, hills and trees, which isn't saying much for the story."
3,KEEEEEEEEEELAR,"this here book about the virtues of man and the contrast of good and evil as paralled through characters better known as ""Adam and Eve"" is good, but not as good as one we all know as ""West of Hell"" and that is the bible! Stieinbeck is the debil!"
5,A thought provoking book - a true classic!,"It has been twenty or, sadly, maybe thirty years ago since I've read a Steinbeck. A couple of books that I passed on at that time were 'East of Eden' and 'The Grapes of Wrath'. In 'East of Eden' Steinbeck still amazes me with the depth of his characters, and the intricasies of their relationships with each other. If an award was given for 'best supporting character', I would vote for Samuel Hamilton! His simple joy of life and home-spun wisdom are an interesting contrast with the chronically, evil Kate. This book will stay with anyone who reads it for a long time. 'The Grapes of Wrath' will be next for me - I know that I will not be disappointed!"
1,A good middle school read,"When I was in middle school, I read Steinbeck voraciously. I cried at the end of Of Mice And Men to the point of total embarrasement. I blinked hard at The Pearl and wanted a Red Pony. Little did I know, that ten years later I would pick up East of Eden and discover (to my shock!) that Steibeck, though a good story teller, was a terrible writer. Lord knows intelligent people will disagree with me on this one, but I found East of Eden to be trite, oversimplified, and downright silly at about every turn. I'm sorry to say that my Steinbeck days are now officially behind me."
1,A weaker sense of direction than a drunken cow in the fog.,"With this calamitous effort, John Steinbeck makes an effort to create an epic masterpiece. Unfortunately, his brushstrokes grow too large, and the panorama that results has too broad a scope. The book loses its focus in its ramblings, and, consequently, its significance. In the early pages you'll meet some characters who are possibly the most irritating, two dimensional elements in any work of fiction since The Scarlet Letter. However, this doesn't matter because Stienbeck will dump most of these characters in no time. Most of the characters live on farms except for the whores and the others. I personally don't live on a farm and am feeling somewhat depressed about it. Now look at that last section(From In the early pages to depressed about it.). It went absolutely nowhere. If you can find some way to stretch that little bit to the length of East of Eden then you'll have your very own masterpiece."
1,tedious reading,"whats all the hype about this voluminous novel that says absolutely nothing. It was hard reading--too many characters--two many families-and -insignificant families ,as well , to the plot. It was a waste of my precious time.Is it because it is Steinback's work that this material got praised. No fair-the book was not worthy. The message was scanty if their even was a message or plot. The writing itself was not worth mentioning . An outstanding author he is not (in my opinion). No more Steinback for me."
2,A Good Read but no direction,"I enjoyed reading the book but I after reading it I felt as though the book had no point. There was no story or direction in the book. After finishing it, I didn't have any thoughts on life or feel as though I was entertained. There was so much action in the beginning but the storyline seemed to stall in the middle and come to no real conclusion. The book is missing something."
5,A Favorite,"This is one of those books that I was assigned to read in highschool, but quickly became one of my favorites. It's a good study on good versus evil and how people have a choice to be good (or evil). Don't read it just because Oprah said to. Read it because it's a great classic and a great read."
4,One of the greatest books,"I recently reread East of Eden. The first time I read it, I thought it was powerful, the second specatcularly powerful. The timeless issues in this book, Cain v. Abel, father and children, knowledge and its pursuit, and of course the concept of pursuing one's own destiny reverberate through each chapter. Whether dealing with Charles and Adam, Lee, Kathy, Caleb and Aron or Samuel and the Hamiltons, the book raises so many questions worth pondering and discussing. I would add this is one of the great book club books. Anybody with a love of thought should read this."
5,One of the Best Books I've Ever Read!,"I read this as a teen, but didn't appreciate the power and beauty of ""East of Eden"" then. It is Steinbeck's best work! I would recommend it to anyone."
4,East Of Eden,"Steinbeck incorporates a number of biblical themes in his novel, East Of Eden. I strongly recommend readers to have an affirmative grasp on the Bible before reading the novel. It was not until my friend mentioned some major themes of the Bible that I fully understand the Steinbeck's intentions. The themes that prevail in this novel are family values, free will, and the ultimate choice of good vs. evil. Note: the reader can understand the novel without a strong biblical background, but one will gain so much more if one is able to incorporate the novel's themes with that of the bible. Biblical themes set aside; the plot of the novel is entirely captivating. The binds of brotherhood and family are constantly tested and the reader is able to witness firsthand how important personal values contribute to one's success in life."
5,The greatest book I have ever read,This book as had a profound impact on me. It is one of the greatest novels of this century and deserves every bit of praise that it gets. I really could interact with the characters. This book made me feel all of the human emotions and most of my emotions were with Aron. This book is one of Steinbeck's greatest achievements.
5,Good story,"This was a richly textured book, with amazingly good character development. I found myself putting the book down at times, just to stop and think about what I've read, and savor the little bits of humor and wisdom. It's been a long time since I've found characters that have stuck with me long after the book has been read. It's not an action-packed, page-turning adventure at all, and would probably make a horribly boring movie. It's more of a home-cooked, slow-simmer novel in a world of fast food stories. I believe that the more you put into this book, the more you will get out of it. Put the time and effort in, and you will most likely end this book a little different of a person than who you were beforehand."
3,Old school writing,Unfortunately not my style. Sometimes a bit boring with descriptions or philosophies. Maye i missed the deer meaning of the novel
4,Best in the series so far,As my review title suggest this one for me was the best so far. But book 4 is turning out to be just as good and maybe even better. I have to finish to be sure. Book one and especially two were major disappointments. Two was confusing!!! I know most people haven't rated this book well but the story was to me a lot easier to follow compared to book 2 and the characters much more realistic to the Star Trek universe.There are many references to past episodes even to other Trek books that blend in wonderfully. The story helps advance major story lines that belong to other series too. I also enjoyed the many species that are involved and for me well written. It was great to read this book and reminded me why I like TNG so much.
5,A richly rewarding read,William Barclay style of writing made me feel at ease - as if I was listening to him speak about the passages of Matthew while sat in my living room with a glass of Scotch whiskey. I read it as a daily practice for reflection in depth on Matthew. It grounded me in the practical living of the Word. He certainly has a typical presbyterian view of the Gospel. I enjoyed his insights so much from this volume one: 1 that I immediately went on to the followon book. I look forward to reading more of his work in years to come.
5,Study Bible,Just what I wanted. This book came on time. Thank you for having it so I could use it in my Bible study.homeland
3,Agatha Christie would be FURIOUS about the edition I read,"Although this is a great book--if you like Agatha Christie for fun, pastime reading--this edition infuriated me. One of the key clues to solving this slowly building, engaging mystery came in the form of an occasionally and purposefully misspelled word. (I won't say anymore!!!) I caught the misspellings as I was reading the book, and yet I overlooked them because the book had several egregious typos in it--leaving me to assume that the misspellings were typos too!!!WRONG!When, at the end of the book, I discovered the importance of some of the misspellings I felt cheated!!!This goes to show you how important copyeditors can be. Granted, not the most glamorous job, but if they do it wrong...erg!!!Oh...the edition I read: Paperback with a purple cover, Pocket Books (Simon and Schuster)--though it doesn't say the year. The cover art is copyrighted 1987, and it looks like the book is the 31st edition (??). Definitely avoid this one!!"
3,"The book is a silly, but sweet book.",A Murder is Announced is a story that leaves you hanging at the edge of your seat. The charcters leave a little to be desired except the wonderful Miss Marple. The plot runs away from you as Dame Agatha goes from creative to down right silly. If you want a real Agatha novel check out And Then There Was None.
4,Hilarious parody!,"I don't know if anyone will ever see this review since the book is out of print, but this National Lampoon parody is absolutely hilarious. This satiric look at a 1960's yearbook is wonderfully executed. Plan on reading it several times if you want to get all the jokes. Read it and weap with laughter."
5,Very Cool,I'm a huge Halloween fan and this is awesome! The small mask that comes with it is surprisingly well made and a very nice touch. Worth every penny!
1,Amazing movie,"Don't even bother with this disc. Its a joke, a complete and utter joke!! I saw this at my local electronics outlet along with the theatrical version. Both released by the same company. Yet for some reason the theatrical DVD comes with a whole bunch of great features and video and audio remastering while this ""extended"" disc is in 2 channel Dolby and comes with no extras. Bah! While the extra scenes added to the original are nice, they're not spectacular. (For those who don't know, the TV network standards required cuts to be made in the movie, the movie would be under time, so Debra Hill and the crew making Halloween 2 spent 3 days shooting additional scenes for the TV Version.) There's really only one scene that stands out - Loomis goes to Myers psych ward room to find ""Sister"" carved on the door. There, now go buy the theatrical disc."
1,The Night He ..Kept.. Coming Home,"It's official Halloween is on dvd. How would I know? Well, my closet is full of them and I've added on a room. I now have a Halloween Wing on my house also known as the Hallowing. Thanks Anchor Bay!"
2,just watch it on halloween/a warning about this particular edition,"all I want to say on this film is that its a classic like everybody says, but it isn't the kind of movie you'd want to watch over and over because that would spoil all the fun. save this for halloween night or for family christmas eve get togethers(!) what I really want to review is this specific edition. the entire second disc is superfluos and its also lacking in real details. the commentary by curtis and carpenter is odd because each speak about the film SEPERATELY and never with each other, like most commentaries. Plus, its really boring and both take it all way too seriously (like most commentaries!). my advice is get a cheaper but still widescreen edition sans commentary and worthless extras. this movie is for WATCHING, not STUDYING."
5,An absolute classic,Classic film with one of the scariest scenes i have ever scene. Pure suspence and tension not dum bimbos with red underwear geting slaughtered in a grusome way it is much more realistice. The smooth camera angles and scary lighting makes this one of the horror movies out there. and it got many immatators like friday the 13th a nightmare on elm street scream and more. this film will scare you and make you have a fun time deffently watch
3,Halloween,This movie still scares me up to now. I just never got to see Michael Myers unmasked. If I do see him without his mask then I wouldn't be as scared. The music scares the creep into me. This is a good movie to watch in the theaters. Just make sure you are with someone.
3,halloween 30th,halloween 30th anniversary box set I was slightly dissappointed in. Because I thought I was getting all of the movies and it was missing 2&3. It gives you a blue ray verson of the 1st one. So you end up with two versons of the 1st one.
3,disappointed,"was very excited to find this on here my hubby is a huge horror fan but was disappointed when we recieved it because the description of the item was not clear on which movies you would recieve with this box set, we expected to have 1-5 and got 1 4 5 and 3 other dvd's which are basically another copy of the first but on bluray, 25 years of horror and a narrative version of the first movie, would recommend a better description of this product so people know what they are paying for since it does cost 50 dollars and in these time money is tight"
3,Aged,"This movie is flat out not scary any more. Sure, for it's time, it was a scary movie. It kept you on the edge of your seat. Not any more. I watched Halloween for the first time just now, and let me tell you, an ""average"" horror movie these days has more suspense than this one. I watched a movie called ""They"" not too long ago, a more recent movie, that had a heck of a lot more suspense than this movie, and most people have probably never heard of it nor did it get any accolades I'd bet, well, at least not compared to this one. I'm sorry, seeing a TV screen cut off because the camera is looking through a mask with heavy breathing is not scary!In the day and age of Saw, The Ring, etc., this just doesn't have the shock value at all. Sort of like ""Rosemary's Baby."" Well regarded for it's time, and the legacy continues to this day, but not scary by today's standards."
4,Horror,I just finished watching the widescreen vhs version of halloween.Wonderful.The thx sound and digital tranfer are wonderful.The colors are great in this version.The story needs no telling from me.I have been watching it on a pan and [scan] vhs version.GOD WHAT A DIFFERANCE IN THE WIDESCREEN.Widescreen is the only way to go for this movie.There is alot going on in the sides of this movie.PAN and [scan] just cuts it.
4,Definitive version,"After several versions release in various formats, this is, in my opinion, the definitive one because: (1) the digital transfer is the best available; (2) the commentary by the director and cast is excellent; and (3) the 87-minute documentary on the making is what DVDs are for. I would like to have the extra scenes as a bonus feature (which is why I give it only 4 starts), but not interspersed in the film - those scenes were shot after the fact only for the purpose of NBC's purchase to complete a running time for TV (as the documetnary explains), and I never felt those extra 12 minutes added to this well-paced masterpiece."
2,Sucker punch,"Pointless '25th anniversary' edition. Sure the film looks and sounds great but so did the last two DVD incarnations. Commentary tracks provided by Carpenter, Hill, and Curtis are adequate and somewhat disappointing. As for the 86 minute 'new' documentary, it's nothing more than a trumped up version of the 30 minute documentary (Halloween Unmasked 2000) with endless, ENDLESS, ENDLESS, ENDLESS, ENDLESS clips --make that entire sequences-- from the movie. Curtis's own 2000 interview is again repeated here as are the same stories from Hill, Carpenter, Tommy Lee Wallace, P.J. Soles, and Nick Castle. I'm not sure what the point was in marketing another version except to cash in on the Halloween title and make money from unassuming customers, like yours truly. Save your money."
5,Not bad!,"Hi, thís is the best horror movie ever. Jamie Lee Curtis is perfect. And the killer is very scary..."
3,"overrated as heck, but still worth a watch...","Pretty good music but lousy acting. Nowhere NEAR as scary as it is reputed to be. I thought the ending was lame. Only worth a rent, if even that."
5,HALLOWEEN KICKSA**!!!!,"Halloween is a wonderful film. It has splended acting, especially by Jamie Lee Curtis, Donald Pleasence, P.J. Soles, and Nancy Loomis, but every actor and actress did great. John Carpenter did a great job directing. See number two, because it has more plot and some explanations that is very well thought out and interesting. See Halloween or buy it today!"
1,POINTLESS!!!!,"What is the point of just releasing what has already been released? The only thing that is new here is the extended edition of Halloween. To Anchor Bay, when are the special, or Divimax, editions, of Curse Of, H20, & Resurrections, coming out?"
4,Great quality (and one little thing),"This DVD edition is really great. Sound, picture, extras... It's all terrific (I bought this US-Version because the German DVD is terrible!). I'm really really satisfied. There is just one little thing: This DVD is not captioned! That's why I give it 4 stars instead of 5."
3,"If it's not broke, don't fix it.","Ok, I have to give this a 3 based on the original film alone. I bought it(though not from amazon), as well as the previous DVD release of Halloween. However, this version of it loses points because of the travesty that has befallen this excitingly frightening film. In an attempt to ""improve"" the video quality, they have simultaneously drained the film of it's mistique. No longer does Michael Myers seem to materilize out of the darkness, now he simply steps out from behind the corner. Essentially, this version of the film falls prey to the idea that every nighttime scene should have a blue hint. The Shape (as Myers is also known) is no longer that, he is now just a guy in a blue-lit room. I recommend you buy the previous version, if you can still find it."
3,How things work in distribution,"As a distributor myself, I can tell you that Anchor Bay does not own the rights to distribute movies such as Halloween 2, and any of the ""missing"" Halloween movies. They can only release the movies they actually own the distribution rights to. That's the deal."
5,The Night He Came Home,"John Carpenter's Halloween is the horror film that started the slasher genre.Although none of the other slasher films have been able to surpass Halloween.The acting is great in this film since we have Jamie Lee Curtis,Charles Cyphers,Nancy Loomis,Donald Pleasance & PJ Soles.The film is very frightening & this film showed us that it's not about blood, it's about the suspence.This is the movie you should choose to watch on Halloween night because it's The One,The Only, The Classic Halloween!I recommend this to any horror fan.It's the best horror movie you can find."
3,Very Good Video Quality,"Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review. Thanks to those who do this.The 2.35:1 video was very good; great for a movie this old. I only saw grain towards the end of the movie, in dark scenes.The audio was only Dolby Digital 5.1. It was adequate.The movie lasted just about 90 minutes."
5,Mike Myers best movie until Austin Powers,This is one of the all-time greatest thrillers. John Carpenter's low-budget masterpiece (he even did the great music) is to Halloween what watching the Grinch is to Christmas. This isn't just one of the best in its genre; it's one of the best movies period. Must own!
3,Myers,if you like masked murderes that will always retun then these movies will be a liking to you the good guys win untill the next movie comes out
3,"Good, but not great","I'd been told lots about this movie, and I was anticipating something more. I can see how it must have been great when it came out, but I was constantly rolling my eyes at the predictability of it.Also, the sound track. Why the same music, over and over?Jamie Lee Curtis was excellent , but all the other characters seemed very scripted and monotonous.It also seemed to me that the movie ended to soon and I wanted to know more, but didn't get enough out of the first movie to rent the second.I enjoyed the movie and some parts made me close my eyes, but I wouldn't say it was my favourite. I guess I'm a special effects kind of a person."
2,Overrated,"John Carpenter is usually regardede as one of the great directors of the genre, but I find him terribly overrated. In the seventies and early eighties he had a good grip on suspense, his movies were mostly amateurish, but inciting. Today one would expect him to be a professional, but he's still directing pure dilettantism, lacking the enthusiasm of his earlier work.Although Halloween is quite scary, in a somewhat childish but effective way, the ethichs are really the most terrifying thing about it, hilarious and monstrous at the same time: Teenagers, having fun in their parents beds, are butchered by a heavy-breathing retard wearing a Halloween-mask. Only the virtuous babysitting heroine survives this sexual-fascist Endlösung. One would almost suspect that these kind of movies were made with the support of the Christian Right."
4,AWESOME MOVIE!!!!,"If you and your friends want a good scare on Halloween, this is THE movie to see. Jamie Lee Curtis is a great actress and plays the part really well. What makes this movie really great, is that it could really happen. Another thing that makes this movie great is the plot."
3,Tricky Love Story!,"This movie ended me crying!! The man loves the woman so much that he pretends to be trickster and goes to her house in a stars trek mask. He waits for most of movie to see her for the right timing. It is tricky some of the times because you are in his mask or next to him in the bushes, or sometimes walking up the stairs of the house! It was sad to me for even his woman love is scared of him, just like the dragon monster who made friends with the village people in a learning book. Maybe he was not as good looking and that is why they were yelling with wire hangers and guns. It made me sad - they shoot him and he ran away crying!! I felt very scared by the bald man - he has big eyes that look like cartoon bird! If he look at me, I run too; very fast and many times away!! Keep running, trickster with love - I have two stars treat for you!!! (the movie only gets three stars because of meanness)"
1,Treat or Trick?,"I saw this B-Movie in the theatre with a fellow film school friend and we sat there easily predicting to eachother what was going to happen next. If you've seen any slasher films before - you've seen this one.I like the fact that there is a cheapo culture out there, it often produces some charismatic stuff, but please don't endow this bland teenager movie with superpowers because when you were a kid you jumped out of your seat.Fortunately for John Carpenter he has a following of people who apparently just can't get enough popcorn.I like dumb movies too like the AMAZING COLOSSAL BEAST and I WAS A TEENAGE WEREWOLF but I'm not about to give them four stars.To anyone that hasn't seen this yet but is intrigued by the success of the series I say ring another doorbell - they're giving out cheap candy over here."
4,Dr. Loomis !!!!!!!,"Ok, this movie wasn't that bad or that good. It was ok. Dr. Loomis is the best character in the Halloween series. This movie wasn't really that informative about who Michael Myers is. It did have some jolts and was pretty entertaining. The rests of the series where assome, except 2 and 3 which sucked, , (Halloween 4-8 highly recomended)"
3,Just Can't Say I Liked It,"I will not write a synopsis as this has been done very well before I put my 2 cents in. I must say that I loved the first two books in this series (and have really liked most of Miss London's previous books), but this one had me skimming which is always a bad sign. I never believed the chemistry between the two main characters. There was some good suspense and a mystery to solve which was the only reason I gave this book 3 stars instead of 2. I know others will disagree with me, and hope they do. For me, this one just didn't do it."
2,"Not much ""Bounce"" in this title","I've read most of the non-western Elmore Leonard collection. I've enjoyed just about everything he has written. The Big Bounce is probably near the bottom of my favorites. Jack Ryan just isn't that attractive a protagonist, and the story just didn't have that much ""bounce."" What's at the bottom of the list? Probably Tishomingo Blues."
3,Not one of Dutch's best.,"Jack is a former minor league ballplayer who dabbles in breaking and entering. That is when he's not engaged in more legitimate endeavors like carpet cleaning or picking cucumbers. Nancy is a risk taking party girl with a mean streak a mile long. The Big Bounce is largely about the odd relationship between these two rather unsympathetic characters. Nancy wants to use Jack to pull off a big heist. Jack pretty much just lives from day to day. The words loyalty, ambition and commitment evidently are not part of his vocabulary.Elmore Leonard's talent for writing realistic dialogue is well represented here. As is his signature habit of populating his books with quirky characters. The plot is somewhat on the thin side and a few of the scenes appear to have been added in for padding. The Big Bounce is an easy and amusing read. But not one of Leonard's best efforts by a long shot."
1,The Small Bounce,"Sorry Mr. Leonard, but this book is awful. Where's the argument, the plot, the meaning. Where's the sense. It's the second and last Leonard's book in my list."
3,"Good charectors, good plot, falls apart","This is my fourth Leonard book, When The Woman Come out to dance has some great compact short fiction. Tishomingo Blues had amaizing chaectors, and a great story set in the south which i won't ruin for you. Get Shorty was one of his best set in my home Town of LA, so far the Big Bounce is by far the weakest novel i've read by Leonard...It starts off with all the right ingedients unique intresting charectors. Good setting. And an intresting premise of stealing 50,000 dollars. It takes a while for the plot to build meticusesly, it really starts to pick up after you're two thirds into it, it starts to climax, and then nothing happens...it seems like Leonard just got bored with it and coped out. It ended totally unresolved and unsastisfying. Don't bother with this one, if you want to se Leonard at his best pick up a copy of Get Shorty"
4,Regarding the Free Kindle Version,"I enjoyed this short novel very much. > > There appears to be a chunk of the text missing at 98% The reader is about to hear some detail on a shooting and all that we see is ****** The next paragraph picks up in a completely different setting. I'm assuming there are at least five to ten pages missing, but I haven't compared the paperback to the ebook. Was I the only person to experience this?What a nice story. Interesting peeks into a woman's life in the raw west. There was just enough detail to keep the reader involved, but not too much to turn it tedious or boring.All in all a nice story. I know others debate if these are true letters from that time or from a woman who experienced these things. I don't care. I enjoyed it."
5,Loved it!,"Great story, good writer...I enjoyed this book immensely. Get a glimpse into what it was like living in the early american frontier."
4,For the love of the past,"Ah, for our connection to the past. A wonderful read with enough nostalgia to pull you directly into the past.Don't forget to put this book on your must read list. A few difficult passages with reference to race, but thedialogue was true to that period, and the comments the same. My, we have come a long way. However, for a connection to the past thatwill leave you wanting more, have a read of Letters of a Woman Homesteader. You won't be sorry..."
5,A Delightful Read,"This small book gives a world of information and an amazing word picture of life, attitudes, personalities, and the cooperation and joy of the time. You also have a view of the challenges and the means to meet them. It's a keeper, since you will want to revisit this book periodically."
3,Flotie is ok but not great,Floties are hard to blow up. The air escapes before you close the valve. They don't seem to be large enough to keep my 2 year old grandson afloat. It helps but it does not do what I expected.
4,Soft Fabric Armband Floaties,"I purchased these floaties for my grandson. They worked well, but I anticipate they will work better next year when he is alittle older. The soft fabric is really nice, it dosn't leave red marks on his arms. The armbands came early and packaged very well. I was very pleased."
5,Mucho Mambo,"This CD is all around excellent! I had bought this for only the rare song ""Arrollando"" by Machito and I wasn't expecting to find sooo many other equally amazing songs on this album. What a splendid surprise! I have a new appreciation for Mambo, especially the works of the one and only Cal Tjader :) If you want to learn more about Mambo or you are taking a class about Latin America and you need background music, BUY THIS ALBUM!"
3,Disappointing,"Among Tommy Garrett's Fifty Guitars repetoire there are two older published albums, Return to Paradise and Fifty Guitars Go Italiano, which are every bit as vibrantly rich in quality as the two South of the Border CDs. The music on these is exceptionally beautiful. Please ask Tommy Garrett to put these two in CD format! Western Movie Themes and Songs didn't quite measure up. The South of the Border pieces which are included in this CD are predictably great, but I can't say the same of the western movie themes and song adaptations."
4,A Journey to the Past,"This sad story takes you through the life of a girl named Heidi, her mother Sophia (So B. It), and their caretaker Bernie. Sophia has a mental disability and is taken care of by Bernie, who is an angora phobic. Heidi is desperate to find out her mother's past. This is where her journey begins. This story although sad is also encouraging. You are routing for Heidi to make it even though the odds are stacked against her."
5,Charming and powerful,My 11 year old read this at school and got me to read this excellent book. A strong young girl shows bravery and strength of character; great read.
1,Ohhh NO!,I was happily reading my book when I turned from pg. 156 to the next page...93! This book had skipped back to pg. 93 and bound 30 pages I had already read and left out pages 157 - 188!! I was furiously at a loss without those 30 pages. I ended up hitting the library for the book and those lost 31 pages.
3,on the reading list,This book was on a reading list for my teenage daughter. She seemed to enjoy it.
1,An Awful Book,This book was incredibly boring and depressing. It has almost no plot and it's too predictable.I hated this book and I would not reccomend it to other people.
5,This book is amazing,You should read this book I have read it twice and its better every time I read it u would LOVE it it's a book for all readers
4,The consolidation of a Come back,"Since the begining of the new century, classic speed/power metal band from Germany, Helloween, has been in a steady way of success not seen since their early days back in the late eighties. Their 2005 album, Keeper of the Seven Keys: The Legacy represents, perhaps, the climb of this tendency. This first single release shows the two main band's characteristics: the sense of commercial metal with catchy hooks, good rythmn and speed guitars, and one of the most powerfull sounds in heavy metal nowadays, plus an extra track that is ""Run""."
2,Works ok in windows but nothing in linux,"I got this all in one a while back and it was pretty easy to set up in windows. Had a minor issue with an xml settings file, but as soon as I overwrote that it worked just fine.In Linux however, it just won't work at all. No drivers for it and no workarounds.I wouldn't recommend this printer if you work primarily in Linux. Windows is ok though."
2,Doesn't satisfy this long-time user,"I've used Omnipage for years, going through almost all the versions since the first. When an upgrade appeared it consistently offered incremental improvements and I rarely had to even glance at the user's manual.Not so with this version. In some key respects it is not apparent how it works even after consulting the manual. There are many more errors in text and formatting. Saves don't even go smoothly. I would guess that something that formerly took me 45 minutes now takes me several hours, including corrections. And I still don't know why the text selection doesn't flow from one page to the next in a multi-page document, as it used to. This product should have been put in the ""leave well enough along category."""
3,Mr. Bean - just this side of the Dark Ages.,"If you are a Rowan Atkinson fan and/or a rabid fan of British humor, This could be the show for you.British humor (specifically, packaged in this venue) at times, as all the pacing of a ""knock, knock"" joke.Most of the action is based on gore.Most of humor is based on lampooning British history = so, fun for all.Then again, it could have been really funny 25, 30 years ago, when it was made.It's very typical of 1/2 hour BritComs of the period.I was looking for more Bean and less Python."
1,This was strange.....,"I am not sure what to make of this series. If it was supposed to be humor and have satire comedy in it, I don't get it."
4,Nostalgia at its best.,"I remember this movie when it first came out. It was eye candy then, it's eye candy now. The plot is really thin, but who's watching it for the plot?I'm glad I bought it."
4,"I really like the ""eccentric"" choices Mr. finney selected when he returned to films","Every time i read about LOOKER and WOLFEN (both of which i like and own) , a critic has written that actor Albert Finney chose eccentric rolls with which to resume his film career . This particular picture seems like a smart choice to me . With Michael Crichton both writing and directing , how can you go wrong ? the cast is swell . Yes , sometimes the protagonist takes too many risks . And yes , sometimes the films is stilted . It puts me in mind of some of the better aspects of WESTWORLD though and is fairly smart . If you prefer older movies (there again , pre 1979 or so) , for so many reasons , not the least of which is that you're older now and remember when films were not crafted from video games and repleat with fast edits , C.G.I. , one liners and countless other modern concessions to target audiences of college age and younger , you're apt to like Finny's ""eccentric"" choices ."
2,sad state for a great novelist to have reached,"After _Trinity_, one of Uris' best works, we are given his worst. It is almost as though he is having trouble remaining focused on the story; there are frequent flashbacks to the climactic passages in _Trinity_, usually for no apparent reason. Some stories gallop, some walk purposefully; _Redemption_ meanders aimlessly, retraces its steps, and bonks into trees.The only redeeming feature of the book is the description of Gallipoli, which is still a sore point in Australia and New Zealand and deserves comprehension and remembrance throughout the Western world. Unfortuately one must suffer through the rest of the book to get to the Gallipoli part, and unless you are extremely interested in that particular topic, this book is not time well spent.For an idea of what Uris has accomplished in the past, try _Topaz_ or _QB VII_ in addition to _Trinity_. Given the other great reading Uris has provided us, let's forgive him for this one."
4,Erskine Chiders explained,I had not read any Uris for years and Redemption reawakened my appreciation for this masters works. Coarse language is used only in appropriate places and it contributes to the realistic feelings of this entrancing book. Uris explains my feelings from Christchurch to Derry.
1,Book never received,"I never received this book from Got Books Inc. I did, however, receive the book from Warehouse Deals, Inc., STRANGERS FROM etc. I tried to contact the seller, but no luck. Please either give me a credit or get them to send another book to me. Tracking # is IZA50W200368604135. Thank you and please send me an e-mail regarding this book. Dorothy Joy Ash"
3,"Good book, but not as good as ""Trinity"".","I had to read this sequel to ""Trinity"" because ""Trinity"" was fabulous. ""Redemption"" is a good story by a great storyteller, but it's too much about Gallipoli and not enough about Ireland, even though the principal characters are all connected to the Old Sod.What's best about ""Redemption"" is that it prompted me to re-read ""Trinity"".Read ""Redemption"". You won't be disappointed. Read ""Trinity"". You will be enthralled. And I'm not even Catholic or Irish!"
2,Should Be A Private Affair,"There have been so many songs that have been sampled this past year. Some of them have delivered like Prince's Fury, which samples his clasic track 1999 very well, and others have actually been flawed and lack of merit like Beyonce' and Jay-Z for Deja Vu which sounded similar to Crazy In Love. For Jessica Simpson, she has been not just bad with cover songs like her remake of These Boots Are Made From Walkin' from The Dukes Of Hazard, she also is bad at sampling songs too. Her single, A Public Affair, her first single after her divorce from Nick Lachey, samples the Madonna classic, Holiday. The songs' emotion doesn't deliver very well. The feeling of the song doesn't seem very convincing towards her sound and style. I honestly think she needs to find better material for her next song, because this affair should be private over public.Song: D 1/2+"
4,"Great review source, close to perfection!","I felt this study guide was a great addition to my library of books. It not only helped my nephew study for his Math A test, it helped him with his studies during class. This is an excellent review guide that falls just short of perfection. Some of the explanations were not thorough and tough to understand. This is the only flaw. And mind you this is only on a FEW of the explanations, not all. I would highly reccomend this book to anyone who is planning on taking the Math A exam or if you just need help understanding whats going on in class!"
2,Not The Best Skeet Ulrich Movie,"Basically I only recommend this movie if you are a HUGE fan of Rik Mayall. He made this movie, and the scenes he's not in are almost not worth watching at all! Skeet Ulrich is a good actor, but this movie is almost an insult to his skill. As for Leslie Nelson, this is not a Naked Gun like movie for him, he does not come off as funny as he would normally. Although at first it seems to start heading that way but stops as if hitting a wall."
3,BEAUTIFUL ALASKAN SNOW SCENE,"Great Alaskan scenes,,,,well photographed....cute film on a rainy or snowy day...at times scenes too drawn out...but then it would have been a real short film...."
4,A Good Intro to the World of ERPs,"If you want to know how to implement an enterprise system, this is not the book to rely upon. But if you want an introduction to ERPs and how they can impact your organization, make this the first book you read. Davenport does a good job of laying ""the first brick"" in your continuing education process in regards to ERPs. It is easy to understand and gives real world examples of benefits and pitfalls of different implementation methods and gives the reader a fair view of the magnitude of an ERP project. Not the ERP bible, but a must read."
4,Great color and fabric - noticed imperfections in shades after washing!,"This is such a great color and I loved the napkins upon arrival - I bought 4 packages (16 napkins in all)-- Then I washed them in cold water and I noticed the shading of the dye seemed to vary within each individual napkin - this is only noticeable upon close inspection! They are made of a very durable canvas type material but be prepared to iron them if used for formal dining!Even though they are 100% cotton, the shrinkage was minimal compared to how the matching placemats shrank (I gave them 3 stars).Noticed problems with lint sticking to them too.Still recommend as the fabric itself will last for years and is great for casual dining!"
5,Really holds scent,"This really makes a difference when lit. Smells wonderful and covers up the ""pet"" odor. Not urine or dirty dog smell, but just that you have animals and so your house is going to reflect that in some way. I burn for about 30 minutes and it just refreshes the house."
4,Least A Part of Gateway Series,"This book stands alone as much as any of the 5 Gateways I've read, except that like the others, it says ""to be continued"" in book 7. However, the story to this point does have some partial conclusion. It is a good Voyager story and involves all the crew, but a lot of focus is on Janeway's dilemas leading the caravan. I must say it isn't totally clear why ships from all over the galaxy would want to follow Voyager the direction they are going, especially since danger lies that way. But once you get past that, OK."
5,It changed my entire outlook on my life,"I read this book back in my 20's and have reread it several times since then. I can only say that it put so many things into perspective. It has also helped me understand people around me and gave me the courage to take a lot of risks in my life. It's not a quick fix to make you happy, but the philosophy of this book does instruct on how to live with unhappiness and make better choices that can lead to happiness."
2,Lots of grainy photographs,A scapbook of old photos. Many pictures repeated or cropped. All photos are Black & White and most are reprints from The Toledo Blab!A look at life lived in black & white with no color and very little daylight.
3,"Worked great while it lasted, then fell apart","Functionally, this worked great. Greatly reduced the heat generated from my laptop. Made it comfortable to work long hours with my laptop in my lap.That being said, I used it daily and carried in my laptop bag occasionally. The plastic is flimsy,the rubber feet fell out, the housing cracked, the cord is much too long which makes carring the laptop and chill pad together hazardous (really easy to catch the long loop of cord on something). At the end of 8 months of use it was no longer operational and I had to pitch it.If they would just remanufacture it with some more durable materials and a shorter cord, I'd give it 5 stars."
3,good design except,"I have the one pictured but I got it at walmart for $20. So those worried about it breaking take note of that. I like this cooler because the way they have the fan exhaust coming out of the slit on the back. (Opposed to underneath the pad) so as long as you keep the back clear your good. The one thing I dont like is that it sucks, doesnt blow hot air. So my laptop and the pad are fighting each other for air though I think the pad is winning. I went into the pad to see if i could switch the fans around but there doesnt look to be an easy way. I suppose this could be the reason it breaks due to the constant struggle for air. If it werent for the fans, id given this a 5 star."
1,Poor Construction,"I purchased this chill pad for our 17"" laptop. The product worked well at first but after a couple of months the blades on the fans started to break off until what we are now left with is a plastic portable base. I would not recommend this product to anyone unless you are looking for a cheap temporary replacement to the one you already own."
2,Not so Good,I purchased this product about a year ago and it has already taken a dive. It worked well when new and kept the computer cool and ran guietly until one day the fans started to make a squeeling sound and out it went.
1,"This product Suck, lost my money","i recommend don't buy this product because i waist my money whith that, does'nt work, and made some noise, my laptop not get the cool tempeture than they said..."
2,"Cools great, breaks easily.","This laptop cooling fan was initially bought as a gift for me. It worked pretty well on my 15"" laptop in terms of how great it cooled it. However, after only week of fair use the USB cable broke (the wires got pulled out) and would no longer power the unit, rendering it useless. I thought perhaps it was just a defective product, so, instead of paying shipping to have it repaired or a new cable sent, I just bought another. The new one lasted two weeks, when the USB cable broke in the same fashion as before. I was not rough in handling the product, usually I just used it around the house. Threebb weeks, I went through two of them. This product works great in terms of cooling, but it is not durable."
1,Not working anymore,Its hardly been a month and the product ceased to work!The fans aint moving.Tried to get hold of customer care and it didnt happen either!
5,Excellent,The Targus PA241U Podium Coolpad keeps the bottom of the laptop elevated and prevents overheating of the laptop. Great job!
4,Podium CoolPad (not the ChillPad),"I've used the Podium CoolPad for several years now and love it. The three things I like best are:1 - The space under the laptop really helps keep everything cooler,2 - It slides nicely into the bag with the laptop requiring very little space, and3 - It does not require power that drains the battery and adds to the heat problem.The only reason I did not give the Podium CoolPad 5 stars is that I wish it were a couple of inches wider. I like using it on my lap to help keep both the laptop and myself cooler and those extra two inches would add to the stability."
4,This chillpad thing actually works!,"I was skeptical at first, but willing to try anything to help keep my Apple iBook cool. The tornado chillpad does the trick and is absolutely silent. Especially while playing games a laptop can get really hot with all the processing it needs to go to keep you fragging punks. I was impressed with this product and would recommend it."
1,Flimsy,"This chill pad was terrible. If I could give it a lower rating, I would. I bought two of them four months ago, one for myself, one for my husband. Already, the rubber feet have fallen off, the power switch broke off on the day we received them, thankfully in the on position, and now one of them has completely burned out.I've bought other Targus products, but this one has been a terrible disappointment.Don't wste your money on this product, opt for something a little sturdier instead."
1,Power keeps breaking,"Does the trick but the power cord pooped out on me twice. I got a replacement, which was awesome, but it stopped working after a month just like the first one. I still use the pad though and its helpful."
2,Dissapointing,"I purchased this the same day I purchased my newest laptop. I've had a few laptops but none were my own, so I wanted to be sure I protected my investment. The reason I purchased this product was because it was all I could find in my area and I did not want to wait for shipping. It made a huge difference in cooling my Laptop's temperature down, but it only worked for two weeks. I have no idea why it stopped, it has not been mishandled, and there is nothing wrong with the cord that I can see. It is also difficult to use in conjunction with a tilted table or laptop stand; the laptop tends to slide off of it. Very disappointing, I wish I had saved my packaging so I could get a refund."
1,It is great when it runs,The main problem is with the electrical connector. You have to wiggle it to make it works. After a while you have to wiggle it more and hope.Don't buy this product until they decide to use a $0.10 connector instead of a $0.05 connector.
2,Cools some but returned for better product,I purchased the Targus CoolPad Notebook lift and it did help cool down the notebook some but was not pleased with the quality and the amount it cooled down. I felt my notebook was not well protected from slipping while using it.I returned it and purchased another product that I am very well pleased with.My notebook is very secure on it and it does keep my notebook much cooler than the Targus did.
3,noisy,"The product worked fine for few weeks, but then one of the fans went off- balance. Product still cools fine, but makes the most horrible screeching noise. It is very possible i got a bad product, as I am a big fan of Targus. Needless to say though i am investigating other means of keeping my MBP cool."
2,Too Noisy,I loved it when I first bought it but after approx. 4 months it really started getting loud. Whenever it was on it sounded like a jet. I owned this for alittle over a year and recently threw it away because the fans were working inconsistently.
2,Model NOT the same as pictured,"The item I received was NOT the same as the item pictured. I previously owned one of the Targus PA248U Chill Pads pictured, and it was a wonderful product - small, quiet, and effective. So I ordered another from Amazon, expecting to get the same product. However, the item I received was the ""next generation"" of this item, which is totally different than the item pictured but with the same model number. The item that was actually shipped to me was hour-glass shaped, black, and was EXTREMELY loud. (I could actually hear the fan running from over 50 feet away.)Kudos to Amazon for accepting the returned item and giving me a full refund, including return shipping. I'd like to see them update the pictures on this item though, so that other people don't have the same problems I did."
3,Works well but not for long-term use,"I bought this notebook cooling pad as a birthday present for my husband about 3 years ago. Despite us not using it too often (at its ""peak use"" we only used it about 2-3 times per week), it completely died this morning. About a year ago, it began making noises as if the fans were having issues getting going. I have kept the cool pad almost entirely dust free and in good condition, but it just seems the Little Fans That Could spun for the last time this morning.It does keep your laptop cool and for $10 (which is the price Amazon lists it at the time of the review), it can't be beat for how well it works. However, don't expect it to last more than 2-3 years."
2,Didn't know it was so noisy.,"It does a good job cooling down the laptop but I use it sparingly because it's so noisy. I don't know what its dB rating is but it's certainly not like a typical PC fan. It's like five times louder than a typical PC fan. If there's a different chill pad that's quieter, I'd get one."
4,Cool Air From the Chill Pad,I've got two dual core laptops at home that I remotely run virtual images on and they tend to get rather hot with the lids closed. Putting a Chill Pad under each laptop keeps both of them much cooler. I don't hear the internal fan in the laptops firing up anywhere near as much. I did have to turn the Chill Pad sideways for one of the laptops to align the fan vents with the laptop heat vents but it works fine in that configuration. If I pick the laptop up and put it back on the Chill Pad the fan inside may start to spin off balance. You have to turn it off and then spin it back up. Overall a great deal for heat venting needs.
2,Works but won't last long,I bought this Chill pad and had it for about 6 months before the fans stopped working. Targus was nice enough to send me a replacement free of charge. That one worked for about 3 months before it stopped working and once again Targue send me what appeared to be a better more expensive model (Not this one I'm writing the review for). I'd highly recommend looking elsewhere for a laptop cooler unless you want to be stuck having the frustration of sending it back to Targus every few months.
1,Avoid this Product,"This unit is made of extremely cheap, low-grade plastic. Less than two weeks out of the box, one of the fans began to grind and make noise periodically. The upside was that Targus agreed to replace the unit; the downside was that they wanted five weeks to do it. Five weeks! What am I supposed to do in the meantime?This is the first product of its type that I have owned, but I was pretty shocked, given its price, at how flimsy it was when I took it out of the box. Since I purchased it, the price has dropped drastically (at least temporarily), but knowing what I know now, I wouldn't buy it even at the reduced price. It is just a mickey mouse device."
2,"Loud, Clunky Sounds only after 2-3 months",Worked well when brand spanking new but not a long-term product. The Targus Notebook Chill Pad is trying to hold on for dear life but it sure is making a ruckus.
4,Works. for 1 week.,"I have a Dell inspiron 6000 that gets really really really hot... to where I fell almost like I'm getting burned. Enter Chill pad.I can feel the air being sucked in, and I can put my laptop back on my lap ;)Pros: Works as described. 1 year warranty if bought new.Cons: Well, I want to say the cheap material. I'm guessing it costs Tarugus about 1 dollar to make this unit, so its a bit overpriced at 29.99 (21 here on amazon). But this 'cheap' plastic makes it very light so it adds little weight to the laptop... so it's not really a con per se. While I think it should cost about $10 less, it does the job and does it well.HOWEVER. it lasted about week. After getting a replacenent, that lasted 1 week as well... so not that good overall.get an asus cooler, had 1 4 6 mos now."
2,Actually raised temperature slightly,"First, some of the description and reviews led me to believe that the fans direct hot air out of the back and/or sides of the Chill Pad. This is not the case. The fans only blow straight through top-bottom. Second, if the Chill Pad is sitting on anything -- even though the legs provide a small gap, the air flow is reduced to practically nothing.I bought this to put on top of my DirecTV DVR, to help pull hot air away from the DVR. It actually raised the internal temperature by 2 degrees, probably because the air flow it created was very minimal and it blocked some of the vented area on the top of the DVR.Good idea, but the implementation leaves it pretty worthless in my opinion."
4,GOOD ONE!,"You can have the keyboard of ur laptop in a nice height , and it makes the hot air flow, but the begining part of the podium makes the air of the end of the keyboard dosent flow... but perfect for my Hp Dv6000t"
2,OKay but not long lasting and loud,"I purchased this from Staples a few months back. It worked okay, but one of the fans constantly stopped working or made a horrible sound. It just stoppd working tonight."
4,keepin' cool,"I was nervous about getting a chill pad. My friend has owned several because she said they broke frequently and had to be replaced. I have had my chill pad for over a year now and couldn't be happier. Other than the fans being a tad rattly from frequent use, it's a great product. It helps divert the heat from my laptop and keeps my lap nice and cool.I RECOMMEND this product."
1,Poor Quality Product,"I bought this product for the second time, based on the low price, however, as the saying goes ""You get what you paid for."" Which is absolutely true for a second time buyer. It worked fine for a while but as time goes the fan blades begin to get caught in the grill and make a very loud sound and eventually they break off.But I paid under $11 for it so I got what I paid for...I invested alittle more in another brand and it is holding up thus far."
1,Unreliable Rip-off,This product is cheaply made and noisy. The USB power cable developed a problem after 30 days. Don't get ripped off. Avoid this unreliable product.
5,Great Item,"Neither my Apple PowerBook G4 (12.1"") nor iBook G3 (14.1"") gets insanely hot, but I thought it was a good idea to protect them from overheating anyway. Besides, the bonus of being able to swivel the computer easily when at my desk and protect it from spills (I work in a lab with lots of liquids around) made this a worthy purchase."
4,Keeps you from burning,"Don't expect this item to ""cool"" down your laptop. It's just good enough to put it between your lap and the computer. Check for the dimentions of your laptop before buying."
1,Flimsey usb cord,"I have gotten 2 of these from Targus only to have them both break right at the switch. The switch is so flimsey, next time I'm going to go with a different model. I would have expected better from Targus"
1,Minimal air flow and that too in the wrong direction,"The air flow from the two fans is barely noticeable even half an inch from them.And flow is in the opposite direction of what I would expect.I.e. the air is sucked in from the top and pushed out along a longnarrow strip on the long thin side. This causes the laptop to getas hot as it normally would without the chill pad. And I suspect thelow pressure caused by the suction at the top may reduce cooling airflowinto the laptops, most of which have opening at the bottom to suck in air.I would expect the fans to push air up to the laptop sitting on top of it.There is no way to reverse the flow, and the fans are not removable fromthe case as the case moulding forms the fan axle.Total waste of money, other than to see how cheaply todays products are made."
2,Decent while it lasts,"The pad ran quietly, but 2 years later it is missing 5 of the foot pads and the fans no longer run. For something with hardly anything to it, that's sad."
3,Chill Pad,"For some reason I miscalculated size of this pad. It is shorter that my notebook. I think spec should state clearly what is supported size of laptop. Anyway it is working, and when fans is blowing air it actually cool down laptop. Unfortunately quality of fans is low. At start up fans makes a lot of noise and it takes few min to go noise away. I am expecting fan to get stuck very soon."
2,Plastic and cheap,"I received a different chill pad than the one pictured. It is a very undurable plastic, and one of the fans is already making noise after 3 weeks. It does not cool well on a flat surface such as a desk, so the only useful purpose is if you have it on your lap. You get what you pay for I suppose, but I would not suggest it if you have te extra $20."
1,Waste of Money,"I was very optimistic to receive this item because my computer often overheats. I am a college student, so I do a lot of work using my laptop. The cooling pad itself is a little small for my Dell Inspiron 1150; this causes the fans on the cooling pad to be located closer to the front than where they need to be in the back. The product was difficult to get working, but after I fiddled with the cord and the switch for a while it did come on. However, I have had the cooling pad for less than a week and it has already completely quit working. I would not recommend purchasing this product."
3,great animation and action,"I am not really a japanese animation fan, but I saw this movie a while ago and I just had to get it. I loved the carnage and action in the film(there is a lot) and I just love the ideas they have in this film. The storyline is not to complicated and the music is okay. I got the movie sub-titled so I get to hear the original language which, to me, makes the movie a little better. If you like much japanese action, then I think that you will enjoy this film."
4,Actually it's 3.5 but I'd give it a four....,"I watched this on TV and I will give a review. I watched it because there wasn't anything better on. So it's about a hostile takeover in Venus and a group of ordinary people try to survive the war-torn planet. I liked this movie it gave a nice amount of action and it has this feel in a war movie where all you give a damn is will the characters make it or come back in a body bag. However, thrilling as the movie is I had a problem for liking the characters some of them are stupid and some I don't give a care. Like this one girl where she left the safety with the gun trying to kill the general I was laughing and crying at the same time. Not to mention the story I cared less of the nonsense dialogue. Drawbacks aside it's action-packed and it's a pretty cool movie."
4,Average to good product,Pros:* It works good.* Average to good voice quality.Cons:* Unit feels cheap.* Only compatible with Windows OS.
1,Piece of junk,"I have used more presenter remotes than I can count and I have always been very pleased with Targus. But this device is by far the worst presenter remote on the market. I purchased it because it featured the buttons I wanted for the remote, and I felt I made a safe choice with Targus, but I could not be any more dissatisfied with this product. The buttons are hard to push. The power switch doesn't work 9/10 times. The laser is weak (whether you use the supplied betteries or high powered lithiums). The button placement for the record feature is in a good position but it is incredably sinsitive. So it's extremely hard to keep from activating it when not needed, which very quickly distroys the benefits of having it to begin with.If you are in the market for a remote, do not buy this one."
4,Look no wires!,If you own a phone with bluetooth then you need one of these headsets. I waited a while before ordering the item for the price to come down and it did to a reasonable amount here at Amazon.com. The unit works great. I was surprised by the clarity and reception. My only complaint is with Jabra. It would be nice to have some sort of battery meter on the unit. That way you know when to recharge. For those interested I am using it with a Sony 610.
2,Poor Performance,"I used this item with Sony Ericsson T637. While it was comfortable to wear, I could not hear the caller's voice due to the static, and I am holding the phone in my hand so I know it's not the distance that was a problem. I tried several calls at different locations, but the performance remained very poor. I really can't recommend this product - I now bought Motrola HS810, and it works PERFECTLY."
2,"Okay in the car, not great anywhere else","About the only place this thing works well for me is in the car, thankfully. In my house, there's lots of static. The range isn't all that great either. I'm using it with the Motorola V600.Wish I'd bought a Motorola headset."
4,"well, it's okay.","I'll admit that I bought this shape of Bluetooth headset because it wouldn't interfere with my piercings. It synced very well initially with my Sony T616; it only took two tries with the 'simple' instructions, and it doesn't get interference from other people's BT phones around me. My only real complaints are that I wish it would only pick up when I use the button on the headset, not the phone body; and that the sound is a bit muddy, though not terrible. Perhaps I'm spoiled by the T616 and my headphones, but I'd really like a bit more treble. Also, the blue LED can be a bit obnoxious, but that's covered easily with some electrical tape."
2,not so good,"Won't stay behind the ear, ear piece won't stay in ear cannal, cuts out and sometimes won't respond at all. To get a good reception with the cell phone on my hip directly under the earpiece, I have to take the phone out of the case and hold directly under or in front of the earpiece, no more than one foot. I thought these things were supposed to make my life easier."
5,a comfortable and effective workhorse,"Several years ago I tried an early bluetooth headset that was useless, due to a short battery life. I recently decided to see if the technology had improved, and based on the Amazon reviews, chose the Jabra. The Jabra is a joy to use. I put it in my ear, and often forget it is there. It is great while driving. The sound is loud and clear. In fact, my BlackBerry is sometimes difficult to hear. Tha Jabra solves that problem, with great volume. I have used the thing for hours without ever getting a low battery indication. This is not a gimic. It is a useful and effective tool."
1,Disappointing device,"I've been using the BT250 for a couple of weeks now. Here's what I've found:1. The belt clip stinks. The device drops off it all the time. It's silly to see a $90 device sabotaged by a 15 cent piece of plastic. (It looks stupid, also.)2. The standby time is nowhere near the 240 hours Jabra advertises. I find that it gives me a low power indication after about 24 hours.3. The 250 is awkward to put on your ear, which is a real pain when you're trying to take a call.4. I've found no way to voice dial on my Blackberry 7290 with the 250.5. The distance you can be from your phone is more like 10 feet, as opposed to the 30 that Jabra advertises.6. The volume is very loud on the Jabra. I have to turn down the phone or reduce the volume using the buttons on the 250 all the time.I'd recommend the Motorola HS810 which has a good carrying case, voice dials on the 7290 with no problems, goes on more easily, and has more intelligently designed buttons."
1,Not Ready for Prime Time,"This headset is not worth the money. In my case, it was not worth any money. It has a range of about the length of your arm. It does not work worth a darn outside of the car. It has a hissing sound in the background all the time. It crackles and pops most of the time. I love my Treo 650 but this headset stinks. I received this headset as a gift so it did not cost me anything yet I am still disatisfied and will be ordering a different brand. Take my advice, avoid this headset. If not, well, you were warned.Update: Recently purchased the new Treo 650 headset by PalmOne. That is the new Bluetooth 1.2 version, not the clone of this Jabra. Much, much better. Now I have a headset that I can use all the time. I have replaced all my other headsets."
4,Pretty good product,I just bought the Jabra BT250 and have only been using it for about a week now. It has a bit of delay when you answer or place a call but it is tolerable. I have always had a very hard time finding earphones that fit me and will stay in my ear (from cell phone earbuds to mp3 players). This fits very securly and comfortably. Easily could forget I have it on. Have only gone about 20 feet from my phone but the phone was in my car with the door closed and I walked to get the mail... I did get a bit of static but perfectly usable. Occasionally I try to place a call and the Jabra doesn't seem to make the connection and I end up using the phone itself. But this has only happened less than 5% of the calls I've made. Easy to put on with one hand...while driving.Overall I'd say good buy only negative that I see so far is the occasional time when I can't get the Jabra to click on and receive the call.
2,A Civil Engineer's Perspective,"Not impressed. The print of the text is smudged. I did not find this book useful. I have been practicing civil engineering hydrologic design for 32 years, and I thought I had found a catch-all handbook."
4,good enough,"I recently bought this camera and was very excited about the hype. This camera looks great, very ""quality"" feeling, I also find it has the ability to take great pictures, you just have to experiment with the settings. My only gripe about the camera is that the sound quality is SO bad. My 4 year old camera sounds clearer! If you don't care about the sound quality then I would recommend this camera for you. Overall, it's good enough."
5,Great Camera,I ordered this camera for my son's birthday present - he's captured some great pictures thus far!
4,Amazing but there's no zoom while making movies.,"This is the better compact point and shoot digital camera I ever had. I have had few cameras before this one, including two different SLR's. This camera has an amazing zoom and the lens are very clear. The LCD is bigger enough and the image is very good too. The only think I miss was the ability to use the ZOOM while making movies, but the movie itself is amazing also."
5,Wonderful,"I bought it to replace an old HP Photosmart R607 (which took low quality pictures inside or outside). The 3"" screen is great compared to the 1.5"" that I used to have.It doesn't have a viewfinder, but neither do many of the newer model cameras out there anyways. I didn't make much use the viewfinder on the Photosmart.The flash is really bright; I'd much rather prefer to brighten up the pictures in Photoshop or some other photo editing software. So I think I'll just keep the flash on forced off.It's a great camera, people shouldn't expect DSLR quality out of a P&S;."
5,Love this camera,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 8 year old daughter. I am a photographer and she always wants to take pictures with my camera. So why not get her one of her own. I didn't want to get an ok camera and in a couple years get another so I opted for this one. WOW!!! This is a great camera and she loves it. The zoom and wide angle are great. The large display screen in the back makes me squint at my smaller one. She has already figured out how to make a video on it and I have to say they are great! They have a good quality, but obviously you need a larger memory card. I would recommend to anyone!!"
2,continous misfortune,"I love all features of this camera, pictures are beautiful, it is easy to take them, but... There is no way I can use it now - it has some electrick shortcut in it that makes battery to overheat while not in use, burns it out after couple shots, lens gets stuck in open position. I sent it for repair since it is still on manufacturer's warranty and they returned it to me not working at all after 1.5 months of wait. First - do not rely on warranty. second - if you buy - check that you cna take more than 10 pictures at a time - that has been maximum I could do. If light is low than about 3 - before so called repairs..."
5,Love this!!!,"This camera is awesome. I absolutely love it. It's small enough to carry in my purse and yet has all the power of a big camera. It's simple to use, takes excellent photos, takes great video, and has been a great addition to my list of doodads. :)"
3,Zoom in on Poor Picture Quality,"I was, am and will always be a die hard fan of Canon cameras. The photo quality on this Panansonic did not live up to my expectations based on previous Canon film and digital cameras I have owned. The 10x zoom in such a small camera body is attractive, but I wound up selling this camera to a friend who thought it was a good deal. Stay true to Canon!"
3,Consistent,"Would like to give it 3.5.Cons: sensor sizeThat alone kills all the good stuff both Pana and Leica put together.An indoors-no-flash shot at ISO 400: the noise becomes visible in the Bridge.Pros: everything else.Convenient, consistent outdoors in a good light setting.A comment on the longer end of the zoom: be realistic and refrain from shooting without a tripod. No image stabilizer can compensate a shacking 500 mm tele.Thank you for your time!"
1,Way too much Noise Reduction,"After having this camera for 3 weeks and taking it on a trip to Hawaii, I must say it is a poor choice for a camera. My main complaints:1) Too much Noise Reduction over ISO 100 setting. What this means in layman's terms is that pictures look ""blurry"" or ""soft pixelated"".2) The lens gets dirty easily due to the swing open little plastic doors.3) Pictures are TOO DARK and skew BLUE.4) The size is large, it's heavy.At the end of the day, I would go with a Canon. They have much better color quality and are reasonably priced. You will miss the 10X zoom and wide angle though... that is the main reason I bought this camera in the first place.It's en-route back to Amazon as we speak."
1,Worst Camera Ever,"In the beginning I was very excited to have a camera with 10 optical zoom. This was the reason I switched from the very reliable Cannon digital camera to the Panasonic. I have had this camera for 4 months. It takes fine pictures but other then the increased optical zoom I don't like it better then the 3 Cannons I have owned before. I bought this camera for a trip to Egypt. The camera worked the day before my trip and the first day of my tour it stopped working. It would turn on and off, on and off and then say turn off and then back on. All it would do is repeat this over and over. Needless to say I was not able to purchase another camera or have it fixed on my tour. I had to rely on disposible cameras and other people's photos. I will NEVER purchase another Panasonic camera again."
5,great camera,"Superb zoom action, easy to use, lots of functions, large viewing screen, digital printout is great."
3,"""Primitive, Tegan....primitive...""","""Earthshock"" is a very successful adventure. The sleek, creepy robots in the caves, the gun play, the unpublisied return of the Cybermen, looking more streamlined, and a clever explanation for why the Dinosaurs died. Matthew Waterhouse has some of his best lines in this one(and with good reason, too). The Cybermen are also effectively campy and nostalgic, with some great and traditional one-liners. Although Nyssa is sort of left behind in the TARDIS for two episodes, the regulars and guest give it their best. But this is not Saward's best script, as sometimes too much is thrown in, and a few plot holes linger around, too. Definetly one enjoy."
1,Buyer Beware,"Watch Out read the all of the the write up on the the pump at the very end it will state Factory reconditioned then look at the photo of the product nowhere do you see Factory reconditioned on it but wait til you open the box instead of utilty pump you see Factory reconditioned, this is very missleading by Amazon thats the reason for the 1 star not for the pump that's for Amazon."
4,Effectively specialized for book scanning,"Great scanner for books ONLY... Do not recommend for documents. No feeder or alignment guides. Big buttons, easy operation. Scanned about 200+ big textbook pages per hour."
1,Broke out of the box,After following the instructions I had to contact customer service (must be done on-line) to tell them that the machine plug is defective. It will take 2 weeks to get the new part and in the mean time I am up the creek.I also found it strange that the exact reviews here on Amazon are on 4 other website word for word. This tells me that they were written by the company and not real people.I can not say anything good about this machine as it does not work yet.
1,worst customer service,"first time using, motor would come on, but no pressure. tried contacting them via telephone, impossible!! finally used 'chat' line, after trouble shooting with them for 3.5 hrs, determined machine was defective. all they offer is to repair and return the machine. wanted a new machine, as this machine was DEFECTIVE! even after speaking with a 'customer service manager', they said that was the best their company can offer. really glad bought this machine from amazon, as they will take the machine back and give me a refund.moral of story - hope your machine works ok when you recv'd it, otherwise, this company has no customer service."
1,Please don't buy this,"I had this unit for about 3 months before it broke. The detergent stopped dispensing. Tried to call customer service but there is no phone number listed anywhere. All you can do is chat online, which I did. They determined the problem and sent me a new suction assembly to install myself. Why am I installing this and repairing it myself when it is under warranty? After installing the new part which took a couple of hours, the detergent still wouldn't dispense. Back to chatting and their response is that I don't know how to use the unit.Do yourself a favor and pass this one up."
3,try on-line help,"I just write to on-line help to check on the detergent tank. They talked to me IMMEDIATELY even though I didn't yet own the power washer. He said there is a detergent tank under the pump in the 1750, and it has a 1 year warranty, so you have a year to figure out if it's missing. I think I'll go with them just because they were SO good on-line and everyone seems to think that power washers need a lot of replacement and repair. He also suggested the FAIP powerwasher Husky 1800, which has a 3year warranty instead of 1 year."
4,"NO LEAKS, JUST HAND TIGHTENED AND SPRAY","this thing did not leak a drop. it has metal fittings to connect the hose and the high pressure line, no cheap plastic stuff. when running is is quieter than your average pressure washer, when you let off the trigger it is completely silent. plenty of power to clean decks and vinyl siding. more powerful than i expected. The turbo wand malfunctioned after just 15 minutes of use, the other wand worked great. They are mailing me a new turbo wand. The unit I received from Amazon appeared to be used/refurbished but it worked great so i didn't complain."
1,Sex and nudity in the city of gambling,This movie is about a woman who goes to Las Vegas to try gambling but instead becomes a prostitute.If the nudity could be removed I believe this could be an exciting thriller about gambling. Instead it is really just like a silly soap opera with lots of nudity.Because of the large amount of nudity in this film I wouldn't recommend it for children or women.
4,Underrated,"This is one of those movies that people seem to either really love or hate. I actually liked the movie for a variety of reasons.First, the plot is believable. A down and out, although attractive woman dreams of being a Las Vegas showgirl. She clearly has the looks and talent to be successful, just not the pedigree. The movie is about what it takes for her to achieve her goal, in a somewhat seamy world where women and men are exploited by a cast of sleazy characters. Secondly, Naomi, the main character played by Elizabeth Berkley, does have character. She eventually has to decide if her dream is worth her compromising her values. And despite being stripper and former call girl, she does have character.I'm not sure why this film is so reviled by some."
5,It's the VALLEY OF THE DOLLS of the 90's,"You have to watch this with the closed caption, because you will constantly be saying, ""wait a minute, they didn't just say that!"" I tell you, there are lines in this movie that only a monkey with a typewriter could have typed.Okay, the entire movie doesn't work at all. It doesn't make sense. The ending throws all logic out the window (did the whole movie take place over one weekend?) And, everyone who befriends Nomi is a moron. She's just unbearable. And her lips are out of this orbit. But... this is so much fun you will watch it again and again. HOWEVER, WARNING: After the eleventh viewing you will suddenly realize, this is really really a bad movie. IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY. So watch it ten times and then give it away before it gets ruined for you.Of course the most classic line in this movie is: MUST BE WEIRD NOT HAVING ANYONE COME ON YOU ANYMORE.God Bless Celluloid!"
2,Not as bad as you may think,"This film is not as bad as the critics and the public say. This movie bares all and holds nothing back. Elizabeth Berkley's acting was sometimes repulsive(and well just plained sucked sometimes). This does sometimes feels like its just trying too hard to glamourous. This was also the first NC-17 film to be released nationwide (in all major cities). MPAA Rating: NC-17 for nudity, strong kinky sex, pervasive strong language, graphic sexual dialogue, a graphic rape scene, drug use and some violence. (Also available in a somewhat edited -R- Rated Version) Intended for mature audiences(both the R & NC-17 version)!"
4,amazing movie - watch out for rape scene,"i lved the movie, amazing choreo. sexy. short mysterious dialogue. just what i was hoping for.however, there is a rape scene in it, a gang rape scene near the end. so if you, like me, have problems veiwing such things, watch out for it. molly goes into a room w the guy w the long hair. just mute it and close your eyes for about 3-5 minutes and you'll be fine.minus that, it's a great movie very artistic and intreeging. shows how dance and sex can be the same and yet not. just how i feel."
4,WORTH MORE THAN SAID!,"Showgirls is a movie that really divides you,some of its elements are fantastic other not that much,i believe if they were careful in some points it would be greater.The dance routines are fantastic and fast,the bodies great,the music is really really good,the plot is great but they could have modified some scenes,for example the rape scene in the end could have been a little more covered not so broadened,the actors are very well chosen and it shows reality and fast rhytms,i do not know if reality is really so bad or that people involved in such a life are so ambitious and ruthless.But i think it worth more than what is said,many people say bad stuff but i do not think they really paid attention more than what meets the eye.Check it that is my advice."
2,"""Showgirls"" An Instant Camp Classic","There are many movies that come along which critics feel compelled to call an ""instant camp classic"". Unfortunately, they are simply bad movies for the most part. ""Showgirls"" is another story. A wonderfully tawdry, overproduced, overacted spectacle featuring a goddess of over the top performing, Elizabeth Berkley. She attacks this glitzy trash as if an Oscar nomination were just within her reach. Gina Gershon and the rest of the cast give this beautiful mistake of a movie the aura of pornographic glamour that only big budget Hollywood could provide. Immensely entertaining, and more fascinating each time I view it. If you're ever feeling depressed, or simply down in the dumps, just watch Ms. Berkley sniff her sad little sniff in what is perhaps my favorite scene. Don't let this movie pass you by simply because it has been labeled ""bad"". This is ""bad"" as high art."
2,Showgirls in a nutshell,"Here is a quick plot description for NEARLY EVERY scene in this movie: Nomi (Berkley) enters the scene. Nomi confronts a co-star. Nomi gets upset. Nomi storms out of the scene. CUT! PRINT!Don't get me wrong. Berkley is exceedingly attractive, and she is nude for a major portion of this film. I like to look at comely naked women as much as any man. But the painful acting and worse script made it a very difficult movie to sit all the way through.My advice for those considering the purchase of this DVD; Keep the remote in hand, and utilize both the MUTE and fast-forward button often."
5,Fantastic-----what this camp classic really deserves!,"Firstly, this film falls into the ""so awful, it's fantastic"" category. Elizabeth Berkeley busts out of her honor student shell, and Gina Gershon gives a stellar performance that we all have come to expect. The film is included (in its full NC-17 glory), but the extras are what makes this set super-special. Included are Showgirls drinking games, two Showgirls shot glasses, a set of Showgirls paying cards, and last but not least, a ""pin the tassle on the Showgirl"" game, complete with glossy poster and suction tassles! This set is awesome!"
3,about this movie......,"The story of the movie is not bad saying that two women are some how fighting for 'fame' in the show. One of the woman is having sex in the personal swimming pool with the guy that is what is in the script for I think is the purpose of fame. The movie makes a good laugh out of it in terms of sex being protrayed in these movies as it tells people that sex is good for adventure, very good and encourages people to try. It makes a good day."
5,Hard to read.,"My grandfather Les Skramstad is mentioned in this book. For me it's a hard book to read knowing what that stuff did to not only my grandfather and my family, but millions of other families as well. I have to thank Gala Benefield for everything that she has done and continues to go for my family. I appreciate it and I think that the author of this book did a hell of a job telling the story and relating the facts behind it."
4,Not bad,"While this is definitly an informative book, it is more of a reference book as opposed to a book which will teach you the language with little or no Russian background. If you're already a student in Russian, this would make a good supplemtent to your studies. It is nice to have for a quick reference in the confusing or more subtle points of Russian grammar. However, if you have no background in Russian, I doubt that this book would be a good starting point."
1,Bad Sound,"I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this item. I agree with the review by ""R. Burns"" ( real name? really?!) that the sound quality is choppy and poor. At first I thought it was my fault and something to do with the way I transferred it to iTunes, but no, it sounds just as bad played directly from the CD.I also just noticed the disclaimer that the CD is created ""on demand"" by amazon as needed. I think something is wrong with their master.Since I got this item as part of a Burns night supper package and didn't order it on its own, I'm not as upset as I might be, but I think I'll still contact amazon's customer service and see about a replacement or refund."
2,Color does not match picture,ordered this plant older thinking it would look like the color in the picture...well it doesn't! color was more of a teal or aqua color..not what i wanted but Amazon was very professional about the return.
2,Beware-- shipping ruins these planters.,"I bought these planters because I had owned them before and they were very durable and attractive. I especially liked the high-gloss look. Unfortunately, when I received my planters, they had been put in the shipping box with the wadded up, rough craft paper that Amazon so often uses and it ruined the high-gloss finish of the outer planter. The other planters were nested inside and were fine. So when I ordered them in another size, I ordered one extra figuring that they would be packaged the same way despite the fact that I notified Amazon of the problem. Sure enough, same problem, but I was able to return the ruined outer one that I didn't want anyway-- it essentially served as packing."
1,Failed class,Hi. This movie worth renting not buying. if buying used! saving some time not worth. low buget. frist one was way better. music was not good.
4,Daughter's now part of the airsoft games,"My daughter wanted to join the buys playing ""bad guys"" and this was a good fit. We haven't used any caps but the gun is good quality for the price"
1,Item is Not as Described!,I ordered two of these pans. One for myself and one for my sister. We DID NOT RECEIVE A STAINLESS PAN! We received an aluminum pan with a non-stick black coating on the interior. The pans we received were from the MC2 collection. Amazon sent me a new pan but I received another MC2 pan. So now I have to return two pans and my sister must return one. We are both collecting the 3-ply All-Clad stainless cookware. I am very dissapointed. Amazon will not honor a comparable sale price on a stainless pan.
5,Amazingly Good-Best of the 4 Pre-Photograph Smile CD's-Buy!,"After buying and loving Photograph Smile, I bought this CD and my only disappointment is that I didn't discover it in 1991. Displaying an amazing vocal versatility and showing remarkable progress and maturity as a singer and songwriter, this CD shows him moving closer to his current sound in Photograph Smile. You can feel the emotion of Maybe I Was Wrong and Take Me Home and the positive energy of Help Yourself. This man is incredibly talented and probably one of the most under-rated musicians out there. Buy this CD and see if you don't agree and wonder why it didn't hit big when it was originally released. The best of the four pre-Photograph Smile CD's, including Valotte, in my opinion."
2,Not impressed,"There wasn't the typical depth to the characters that I'm used to from Ms Roberts. I have loved almost every other book I've read that she has written, so this was a disappointment. I'm glad I didn't pay that much for it. It had a decent story line, and it moved along at a decent pace, but again, the characters just weren't up to par. I understand that this is a reprint of a book written in the 80's, and you can tell how well Ms Roberts has evolved in her writing technique."
2,A bit of new-author fluff,I have to agree with most of the previous reviews.....this book is one of Ms. Roberts first attempts at romance and it does fall short in many ways. I wish the characters of Cassidy and Colin had been better developed for the reader to get more enjoyment out of the story.
4,A good book that doesn't disguise its agenda,"Although I enjoyed the read, I must say that Phillips tends to paint his program of socratic dialogues in the best light he can afford. I think that the Socrates Cafe concept is a great idea. Let's bring philosophy back to the people, but let's be realistic. Phillips hopes that his readers will be so moved as to begin a chapter and set off pursuing knowledge and an understanding of their world. But he doesn't touch on the potential problems and pitfalls of the program until the end of the book (in the FAQ section for those interested in beginning a chapter). And let's be realistic, the purpose of this book is to promote his group.Still, it's a good read that promotes not only philosophical dialogue, but also social improvement. And, if nothing else, it'll hopefully get more and more people interested in philosophy."
2,A Bland Taste of the Socratic Method,"""Socrates Cafe"" delivers some of the essentials of philosophy, but not without a complete obsession on Socrates and his method. Unfortunately there is no detailed history of his life or works, simply little hints at his identity. Phillips instead attempts to frame Socrates in his own light, and his writing becomes repetitive and dull, even with the varied tales of philosophical discussion. The characters all seem to be the same: prisoners, children, and graduate students all speak in the same careful manner, quoting historical figures like a legion of robots.What saves this book from complete disaster is its novelty."
2,"Oh, that's where I've seen him!","I probably would have given up on this movie if I hadn't been trying to figure out where I'd seen Alessandro Nivola (of ""Face Off"") before. The viewer is shown a part of the end of the movie and then we're dragged through a grimy, rather dull story to find out how the characters arrived at this end. The movie simply takes too long to get to the point. The story is not fast paced enough to keep your attention. The twist at the end, which unfortunately comes to late to save the movie, reminded me of an O'Henry story. The plot would probably make a better book or short story than a movie."
2,Couldn't put it down-but would NOT recommend,"In the beginning I thought this was going to be boring, but as I got into it I found it to be something that I would NOT recommend to anyone. I thought that BONE COLLECTOR was the best..."
3,A bit slow at times,"It took me a while to get into this book, it seemed a bit slow to start off, but got better as the book progressed."
4,Good Read for Deaver Fans,"Lots of twists and turns, never a dull moment. However, development of main charcter falls short of credibility at ending"
5,A voice from Heaven oh boy! What a voice,"It is incredible how Enrique Iglesias sings, Bailamos is a very romantic song that we (hispanics)feel really proud of Enrique Iglesias. He has such a nice voice, body a very sexy man. And for the people that critize this song bailamos they don't know anything about music. He is a singer that can really sing in english and spanish and any language that he chooses to sing. I really like this CD. Way to go Enrique Iglesias We love very much! in Hyattsville, Maryland"
2,A REAL LET DOWN,"I THOUGHT THE WHOLE CD WOULD HAVE THE RHYTHUM OF BALIAMOS, BUT NO THE REST IS TOO SLOW..... THIS WAS A LET DOWN FOR ME THERE ARE ONLY TWO OTHER GOOD SONGS ON THIS CD. THIS GUY IS NO RICKY MARTIN BY THIS CD. BUY THE BALIAMOS SINGLE ITS MUCH BETTER VALUE"
5,It is incredible,"I have to congratulate Enrique on his new CD. It is truly amazing... Keep up the good workLove always and forever, Moni"
2,Serious proofreading lacking,"Crimes of the RightHer novels are well plotted but seriouslyflawed by scores of typos, misspellings anderrors in diction and grammar. I stopped counting these at 100"
5,Why this is a must see,"This movie has it all, it truly is the best Godzilla ever shot and ranks up there with many Sci-Fi films. It has fantastic special effects, a great score and a very thought out script. They even brought back Yemico, one of the main characters from the original King of the Monsters movie! The action is fast paced and there are scenes unlike any of you have seen in other Godzilla movies. But be prepared, your going to get quite the lump in the ole throat toward the end of the movie. I HIGHLY reccommend this movie to anyone. The only thing I wish they could have done was brought Raymond Burr back for the big finale, but seeing as he is no longer with us I guess that would have been a little difficult."
3,An Improvement,"This Godzilla was more improved, more serious, more dramatic, and more effects. the creature destroyer kind of reminded me of the ALIEN in the Alien Trilogy. Destroyer kind of has the same features as the ALien in the Alien Triolgy with Sigourny Weaver. At least Godzilla died sadly and just watch to see what happens to Baby Godzilla........................"
4,Even when you kill Godzilla you can't kill Godzilla,"Spacegodzilla runs a bit long but Destoroyah, yes and H is a fun movie. The only negitive is that it doesn't really explain what happens at the end."
4,Features~,The lack of both special features and apparent lack of Japanese dub are very sadface inducing.Scene selection and subtitles are all you get on this two sided disc.
5,Cute,My kids love hello kitty. They had this DVD which was scratched from overuse and handling. This is the replacement and its in perfect condition.
1,Heaven's Edge - Some Other Place Some Other Time,"I don't have a copy of this yet either. However I have their first Self titled release. If this is ANYTHING like the first, IT WILL ROCK OUT LOUD!!!!"
1,Aggravating waste of time & money,"I haven't found anything about this product that works like it's supposed to. On top of that I have a fairly new computer with a very fast processor, a huge hard drive and loads of memory that keeps freezing up after I run this thing for awhile. Tech support hasn't even bothered to reply to my queries for help."
5,The language of letting to: daily meditations on codependency(hazelden meditation series),"I only wish I had been introduced to this book earlier on in my life.... Not only does it give me the inspiration I need to move through my life's journey, but I believe this book might give insight to those who find the need to bully others, as well as helping those being bullied."
2,Not the correct edition,The picture that was shown as the book was a newer addition. The book I was sent was a much older edition-22yrs. I was disappointed. It was also written in.
1,The Language of Letting Go,Never received the books. Second time this has happened. Don't Order from Amazon.
3,Not what I expected,"I expected to receive the book as it is pictured, however, I received one with a different cover; don't know if they are the same but was disappointed."
5,A daily source of quietude and healing...,"I have tremendous admiration for Melody Beattie's books. THE LANGUAGE OF LETTING GO is a particular favorite which I use daily as a source of connection with my Higher Power, and has been an important resource in my fledgling recovery from codependence and my desire to have healthy, loving relationships. There is a meditation and suggestion for each day of the year, making it possible to consider issues of recovery ""one day at a time"". It takes a great deal of courage to face codependency and begin a program of recovery; THE LANGUAGE OF LETTING GO is a valuable tool to use in the process."
5,Great book!!!,This book really helped me get through a time in my life when I thought I would rather die than live. It gave insite in the daily apparations and really helped alot.
1,Unacceptable,"I made a terrible mistake with ""the Girls' Gudide"", giving itto my daughter, who is twelve. The book containscasual references to sex and drugs which are not appropriatefor girls of my daughter's age. I wish I had read it first.I don't think much of the book anyway, but do not make mymistake. The Girls' Guide is not for girls."
1,Sorrow,"The badness of this book, forces me to express myself in a higher medium. My emotions can only find proper expression in poetry:I feel sorry for the paper that was wasted.I feel sorry for the ink.I fill sorry for the money that I threw down the sink."
3,G String Murders,"An interesting book written by an inexperienced but intelligent Gypsy Rose Lee. It' hard to follow the story line with all the characters she introduces at different times in the story. It's very choppy, seems to omit information necessary to understanding the flow of events and leaves the reader wanting much more character development. With that said, I did enjoy reading the book if only because it was the first novel from a legend."
5,Charles-Review,"It is a Good Book and it gives kids the idea of Firefighters fighting a fire in the city, country, forest and on the waterfront."
2,magnetic spice rack,"The idea was a good one but,....... the tins fall off the metal base not enough mag in the magnet and they have been rolling all over my kitchen and it's big and bulky and no place to put it, a little too big for my counters. No where to hang either."
2,Magnets fell off as soon as you opened the box,"Thought this was a nice idea for the kitchen, but it was not meant to be. Upon opening the box for the first time, the magnets glued to the bottom of the canisters had already fallen off over half of them. The magnets themselves are very weak and can barely hold the canister itself, let alone with spices inside."
2,Buy something else,"Thought this would be a perfect spice rack, until the magnets came off the tins. Then the jars became hard to turn because the spices tend to get lodged in between the lid and the jar. Ended up tossing it."
5,Campy and Fun,Great Australian 'exploitation' thriller that is a guilty pleasure. Disc arrived promptly and was able to enjoy it by the weekend.
3,Thrilled But Cautious,"I was thrilled to see this title in print, as Katharine Ross is one of my favorite actresses. Please note, I have yet to view this DVD. But, I learned today after viewing the WB Archive Collection website that this is not a remastered version. It is simply a video master produced as a DVD. Thus, I already have concerns about the quality. If I had realized this before purchasing, I probably would not have done so. This apparently is the case for all DVD titles available from the WB Archive Collection."
3,A major disappointment,"A potentially taut and engrossing murder mystery is bungled by a flabby script with unneeded small town ""humor"" inserted into the proceedings, not to mention a disturbing undercurrent of homophobia. When a woman's body is found mutilated on a beach, her Doberman is thought to have turned on her and killed her. When an autopsy shows she was murdered, a small town cop (James Garner) must sift through the victim's secret and unconventional life to find her killer. Outside of the provocative (for 1972), lesbian angle and the smutty innuendos, this could have been a TV movie. Cast includes Katharine Ross, June Allyson (very good in her one big scene), Peter Lawford, Tom Ewell, Hal Holbrook, Ann Rutherford and Arthur O'Connell.The Warners Archive MOD DVD is a decent wide screen (1.85) transfer."
4,Book for Airedale fanciers and owners,"This is a great book for Airedale breeders, potential exhibitors, owners and fanciers of this marvelous breed of terrier dogs. Lots of pictures of the best of the breed's history that were shown to championship, the forefathers and mothers of the breed we know today, and detailed histories with pedigrees of many of these animals. Complete instructions for stripping, and many insights into training for multiple tasks as the breed is very versatile. Would recommend it to anyone interested in getting an Airedale, or loves the breed."
2,ZZZZZ,"I am a ""dyed in the wool"" ginger-lover and looked forward to a veritable explosion of hot, spicy, tangy ginger in my salivating mouth.Bummer...what was delivered was a somewhat honey-flavored confection...that was merely bland in its intention. Disappointing in demeanor...exhorbitant in cost."
5,LOVE GIN GINs!,"I originally bought GinGins when I was pregnant to help stave off boughts of nausea, and they really work! I keep them by my bed so if I wake up nauseous, I can pop one in my mouth before I sit up. However, they continued to be a go to for motion sickness and colds. They're great melted in hot tea when you're congested. Now, we always have some in the house!"
2,difficult,i have read erdrich in the past. i think she is an excellent writer and one learns a great deal about the Indian culture and tragedy at the hands of the U.S. govern. but this one was too abstract and directionalless for me. it became more a struggle for me to decipher than a learning experience.
2,like gagging on stale bread,"I tried to finish this as I was captivated by one of the authors other books. I also have a commitment with myself to finish every book that I start, which I do; this was an exception; I got to 79% and realized that life is too short to waste time on this kind of diatribe. There clearly are some good points but they were out weighed by far by the ..."
3,Well written...but the plot kind of bored me!,"This was kind of a strange story. As in The Master Butcher's Singing Club, I found myself most intrigued with the story's central protagonist. While Fidelis Waldvogel and Delphine Watzka were central to ""The Master Butcher's Singing Club"", Agnes Dewitt, aka ""Father Damien Modeste"", was the strength of ""The Last Report on the Miracle of Little No Horse"".Although I found Agnes's tale intriguing, I found the rest of the story kind of disjointed. The other characters just didn't blend together for me. Although I saw how Agnes began to accept the religion and customs of the Ojibwe people, I would have liked to see more about their customs. Overall, I felt a bit bored by much of the story. I definitely liked ""The Master Butcher's Singing Club"" better."
5,Just what the doctor ordered!,"This is a peculiar time for jazz. Thanks to the efforts of Wynton Marsalis and a number of very good university programs, more musicians are playing jazz than ever before. The problem, however, is that few are playing it really well, and it's easy for a jazz fan to wonder if anyone really special is out there. Arturo O'Farrill is really special. Seasoned by growing up in a jazz home (his dad was Chico O'Farrill) and tutored at the keyboard by Sir Roland Hanna, Arturo O'Farrill has a muscular, crisp style that is occasionally reminiscent of the early Ahmad Jamal, but which is never derivative. O'Farrill's playing was a revelation to me, and I count the night I heard his trio at the Jazz Standard in New York as one of the best evenings of jazz I've ever heard in my life. My favorite side - ""Chinas Y Criollas"", dedicated to all the Cuban/Chinese restaurants in New York City - but it's all good."
1,waste of time,This Australian film was made to cater to their own breed of red-necks swilling too much weak beer on a greasy couch.The lead actress looks like a tranny because she is a mannikin for a lot of blunted sensabilitity about women or anything else.This is no more than a titillation flick of the weakest and banal kind for men too limp or legless to rent soft pornography .The acting the realism the plot and screennplay all suck.
4,Fun and addictive,"Both games are easy to learn, and fun to play. Be warned they are both very addictive! I liked the graphics & sounds, especially the hissing from the fire, in Alchemy,warning you that one more discard will end the game! Levels of difficulty can be increased as you progress. Cool, non violent, games both adults and youths would enjoy playing."
5,Very Addicting,I played this game after my daughter found it on the web. I am now addicted to it. I work graveyard and come home and play it and find myself not going to sleep. Boy how time flies when your having fun! I finally went out and bought it.
4,"Fun, silly escapist reading","Kylie is a likeable heroine with a heart of gold, however she always finds herself in some sort of klutzy mess, giving the book a slapstick-type of humorous edge. Someone is sabataging the company she works for and setting all the evidence to point to Kylie. As the owner of the company, kind-hearted David he finds himself torn between falling in love her and facing the compelling evidence against her. After a rather slow start, this story eventually leads into an intriquing plot of investigating this corporate embezzlement, as well as fascinating insights into the record producing industry."
5,Essential Boz,"I rate this album right up with Silk Degrees and Slow Dancer as his best work. He's never been funkier than on tracks like Monkey Time, Why Why, and Flames of Love. There are four great ballads, including Love Anyway, one of the best ballads he's ever done. And he also mixes it up a little, throwing in a lot of big band sounding horns on Runnin' Blue and going a little country on Up to You. Of course, the musicianship on every song is incredible. I paid $40 a while ago to get a used copy of this with a mediocre mastering job! I was happy to find that copy, though, and I will gladly buy it again to get the sound upgraded by the new remastering--because it's that good. If you enjoy anything by Boz Scaggs, trust me, you need this."
1,Very interesting and informative,"I was looking for a book on this subject that would bring me up to date on current thinking about the evolution of ourselves. This was an easy read that was also very informative and for me, exciting and interesting. I had not read anything on the topic for at least 10 years. The author presents very common sense theories based on many years of research that are not dependent on a story scenario to make his case(s). The recent NOVA shows on the topic now seem a bit shallow to me after reading this. A great read."
5,Great bang for your buck....,"Pros:Great sound reproduction detailed mids, crisp highs and plenty low frequency response.Good looking (with piano gloss finish).Price (street price around 135$).Cons:Size (but how would you pack three 6.5 inch components other way).Weight (about 22 lbs).Components looks cheap from the back side but doesn't sound cheap by any means.No five-way/bi amping support."
1,Horrible,This is the worst written book I have ever read. Actually I could not even finish it. There is a comma after every other word which makes it hard to follow. You eventually do not even care anymore who did it. I cannot believe it was published.
4,"Good cable, crappy ends.",I regret buying these. They have the cheap ends that aren't entirely hard plastic. Don't get these if you don't plan to plug it and forget it.
2,Game Master,When I bought this game I thought it was going to be fun. But I was disapointed. The only way to play is the pre-made games. If you don't you can't even build a control tower. No tower no flights. In otherwords DON'T BUY THIS GAME!
2,Frustrating,"This game is interesting at the beginning, however money soon begins to run out after a certain amount of time. When you reach a large amount of passenger volume you have to constantly build security gates and lockers and other items in the terminal to keep passengers happy. One of my airports had almost 100 security gates and they kept asking for more - after all the effort you put in the game it just frustrates you."
3,"So-so,","This game can be very frustrating. I always go into debt when running a passenger airport. Unscheduled air planes occaisanly arrive, and a extremley poor tutorial. On the other hand cargo airports are easy to manage. The overall layout is decent. The decision depends on if your ready for a challenge."
3,A good first try,"At first this is a FRUSTRATING game. Help/documentation is almost non-existant. After a bit of floundering the game can be figured-out, but then new frustrations set in. There are limitations on the number of runways and towers; who knows why. The game takes forever to finish...more defined goals such as are seen in RR Tycoon would help a lot. The graphics aren't very good.Having said all that, I still do play it on occasion."
4,Airport Tycoon Review,"I thought that the game is very entertaining. The graphics are in 3D but are OK. Great busness, real life, and entertainment simulation."
2,dont bother,the game was terrible. it has ok graphics but they expect you to build an airport with no money and learn how to play the game with no instructions
2,DUMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"When I bought this game I thought that it was going to be something fun to play. IT WASN'T! It is very slow, it takes forever to get your airport active, and you always end up going into debt. I got it cheap(dollar amount) but it was a waste! DON'T BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!"
1,SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Worst tycoon ever! You have limits for every single thing, lots of bugs, and most of all, it's freakin booooooooooring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't buy this game!"
3,"expensive, nicely built, wish it was bigger","My main complaint is that it isn't a big enough house for toys to play *inside.* I had hoped it would be for this price. It's a fine sturdy house. Pushing things through the door entertains my 20-month-old, and I hope that in a year it will be used for pretend play, but the chances of that would be better if it were bigger."
3,A vacation from the ordinary...,"If you are anything like me, and were curious to read about the Hungarian Countess Elizabeth Bathory; this book is for you. The story is fictional but does contain some historical truth. This story follows not only Elizabeth's life in the 16th century but also her ancestors life in the 20th century. One who has more in common with her then he ever imagined.The story is vivid in describing scenes of sex and gore and may not be recomended to some readers. It is shocking even for someone who is not easily bothered by such themes. At parts you wonder how accuratly the author is describing Elizabeth's life but once you give the writer some liberty you can become enraptured in the story. Personally, any story involving such a wicked and baffling woman in history is going to have appeal."
2,It is a NOVEL (and not that good of one),"This book is a NOVEL, and as such, isn't that great of one. To me, it reads as merely an elaborated story based on an internet biography of Elizabeth Bathory. It almost seems like a Hollywoodized version of a book, changing details and such to make the story flow better. And a good third of the book doesn't even deal directly with Erzebet Bathory, but of some clunky trial. Is it interesting? Yes. Is it an easy read? Yes. Do you learn more about the Lady Bathory? Some. Is it worth spending money on? NO (unless its really really cheap). It seems difficult to make a bad novel on one of the most intriguing figures in history, but nevertheless, this is a bad novel. I give this two stars. It would be one star, but the simple fact that it is about Erzebet Bathory gives it another. Ugh."
3,A vacation from the ordinary...,"If you were anything like myself, and were intrigued by the famous Hungarian Countess Elizabeth Bathory; you would be interested in giving this book a chance. It is fiction so you can't read it as if it were a biography, but it does carry some historical truth to it. The story jumps from Elizabeth Bathory's life in the 16th century to the 20th century following one of her ancestors life. One who shares more with her then he ever wanted to.The story is very vivid in describing graphic scenes of sex and gore. Some parts were shocking even to someone not easily bothered by such themes. At parts you wonder how much liberty the writer took in describing her life and yet as you read on you become enraptured in the book and stop questioning what's realistic and what's not. Elizabeth Bathroy is such a baffling yet intruiging character in history that it's hard not to find this book appealing."
2,not as advertised,"based on the writing, this book should be in the 'romance' section. while the plot is engaging, it is only superficially worked out and the characters have no depth. the writing is pure mass romance with men with hard bodies and fainting women being rescued, at the last minute of course."
3,Call After Midnight,I agree with a librarian friend that Tess Gerritsen and Tami Hoag were mediocre romance writers who blossomed into excellent thriller writers.
4,Easy To Use,"I have a king bed easy to put on. Was what I expected, just would tell you to Iron before putting on the bed, I tried the just let it hang and the wrinkles will fall out...doesn't work that way."
5,You cannot go wrong with Dorati,"Antal Dorati's legendary traversal of the Haydn symphonies was for many years the only complete set (by one conductor and orchestra) of the symphonies. Today, although there are some other complete sets as well as many great period performances, Dorati's cycle still reigns supreme. Dorati manages to make these works still sound fresh and vibrate after two hundred years. There is a level of spontaneity, as well as an ever obvious sense of joy that make the Dorati traversal the best. It may seem like hyperbole, but Dorati is as close as you will get to ""perfect"" when it comes to Haydn.In this CD, three of Haydn's most popular symphonies are glowing showcased. Although these performances were recorded in the 70s, the sound is crystal clear. I strongly suggest buying this CD not only for the fantastic music but also for the chance to become acquainted with Dorati. Soon you will find yourself purchasing the complete 33 disc set."
4,"Good, but needs more variety of languages","Nearly all of the examples were written using Perl, but the few pages written with PHP contained some very useful nuggets!I especially liked the use of the explode() function to split a table-formatted html report into multiple PHP array elements for individual processing. Now, if only the authors had included examples written for ASP, Cold Fusion, etc. they could have appealed to a much wider audience!"
1,Stay away!,"Doesn't work on XP, joystick is too sensitive, overall the worst excuse for a flight sim."
3,Does what it needs to,I would say that installing this is not for the faint of heart. I had to remove several sections of inerior comparment to get to the appropriate wires then I found out the blue lead was not near long enough to reach the locatation where I needed to make the connection and I had to splice in some wire. I was also not happy with the bullet connector. I expected it to be somewhat weather proof rather than the standard type bullet connector. I guess I will be replacing after is corrodes beyond use. Overall it does with it supposed to. I really wish Toyota had been intelligent enough to know that if you rate a vehicle for 5000# towing that people will have surege brakes that need a back up override.
4,Good combo,"Seemed to be a good collaboration Uakti and Glass. The instrumentation of Uakti with the minimalism of Glass sounded great together, kind of primordial. Worth buying, I recommend it for anyone with a sense of adventure..."
1,Pop at commercial!,"Heavy metal to disco to hair metal! Thats commerical! Commerical, means not music with expressions but music that people that buy what ever they hear on a pop radio. Meanless pop may live but to be mock by better music!"
5,Perfect for the New Generation of Kiss fans,"This ""Best Of"" is perfect for the new, younger generation of the KISS Army. Creating a greatest hits album for a band as monumental as KISS - that's been around more than a quarter of a century, with almost 20 studio albums out and various live and solo projects, the task is a daunting one.""Best Of"" has all of the essential classics. With Deuce, Shout it out Loud, Beth, Hard Luck Woman, Calling Dr. Love, and of course the original live version of Rock & Roll All Nite, this is a great beginner's guide to the world of KISS. Not only do you hardcore rock out while you're listening to the album, you're able to gain true respect for KISS by hearing just how influential they have been on today's music scene - song after song. Rock on!"
2,Kiss it Off,"If you're a die hard Kiss fan, you probably already have all these songs, so don't bother with the CD. If you're not, don't bother with this CD. It's full of rather unimaginative, derivative 70's rock, absent the spectacle of their stage performances. If you like Kiss & don't have many of their CDs, then get this one ... it'll do until you can afford the others.Personally, I'd go for concert footage in surround sound, or even music videos. This CD experience was flat, a disappointment. Perhaps I've just grown up too much since the 70's and need to trip back to my youth. Even so, for this genre, I'd prefer Def Leppard--more verve, more creativity, more driving power. More interesting.But choose your own poison ... how you want to blow your hearing is none of my business. This CD just doesn't rate high enough for me to risk tinnitus for it!"
3,Just another greatest hits album.,"I didn't give this album a three star review because of the songs. Let's face it, KISS is a great band and these songs are terrific. The problem with the album is that KISS has already released greatest hits collections and even a box set before. The only reason to release this album is to make more money for the band and record company.The other problems include song selection and cover. Seventeen of the twenty-one tracks come from the 70's leaving little room for later material. KISS made some great songs during the 80's and 90's that are as good as many of their hits from the 70's, but they don't pay much attention to these songs. The problem with the cover is that it only shows the four original members of the band. In fact, no where in the cd booklet do they mention other band members. It's like they never existed.Bottom line: Don't buy this album if you already have any of their many other greatest hits collections."
5,what i think................,"i think this was a good book. i think it was a cool idea to have someone switch bodies with the opposite sex, and even their sister. i think that more books should be written. some about maybe being trapped in his moms body and one with his girlfriend too. i think that would be cool. i also know that deep down, a lot of us guys wud spend a day to live this story. if i were jake, id wanna spend a day as his sister, mostly to know what it was like. i give this book a perfect 10."
3,"It was a sort of funny book, but very shallow.","I did not like this book very much because the plot is too simple. there is an interesting premise, but the jokes are pretty corny!!"
2,Not a developer book,"I will have to put myself in the same corner as a few of my fellow reviewers, this is not a developer book, by far. It also has a lot of repetition in it. You can explain the different security groups twice, but 5 times seems like a little too much... The fact that web parts and customisations are not covered is like the biggest dissapointment to me, because that is what I am looking for in a book. How to use Sharepoint is something you can learn in the online help."
1,Errors everwhere,"I've purchased both this book and the Resource Kit and tried to use them like lifelines because my company is going ga-ga over SharePoint (and I mostly agree). While this book has a lot going for it--it's well written and has a good teaching point of view, I've found a ton of errors in it that have caused me to lose my confidence in it. I still refer to it as a tutorial, but it's an awful lot of money to pay for a book that I can't trust. My advice is to rely on the Resource Kit as a reference and only buy this book as a teaching guide."
3,"Good data, weak analysis...","This book is worth perusing for students and academics who want to understand the various ways that Colombia's armed groups procure economic resources in order to fuel their struggles. However it does not do a sufficient job on the ""greed versus grievance"" debate, nor does it really encapsulate the importance of social movements or the effects of political inclusion and exclusion upon propelling groups to use non-democratic means in the first place. Some academics may find this book to be useful, especially those uninitiated to the Colombian conflict who study armed groups and security. Non-academics will find the book to be neither particularly interesting nor beneficial to understanding the complexity of the conflict..."
2,Leaves to be desired,"Another attempt by an outside oberserver to understand conflicts that are peculiar to South America and its political culture. Accordingly, the analysis does not grasp the intenal dynamics and psychology of the conflict. This book leaves much to be desired."
4,Marillion worthy,"Ok, the cover art is silly, but the live double album is a must have. The lilting introduction of La Gaza Ladra transports you into the concert hall and takes you on a journey trhought the highlights of Marillions' Fish years. A truly great retrospective of their years together as one of the all-time great prog-rock bands."
1,A dissapointment,I have already had one bit bend under normal use and I do not like how quickly these clog up.
1,black adder,this product was designed to be read by an american dvd(which I didn't know before buying it reader so it was no good to me because I live in France and have a french dvd reader
2,Trite and silly,"If you just want to be affirmed that housework can wait, get this book. If you want real help thinking through the problem of too much housework and not enough time, this book will not help you."
1,Worst car game ive ever played...,"i trusted the words of these reviews here ... and i was totally disappointed. for one thing the cars u chase dont get damaged by anything but when you hit them and most of the time it just hurts your car more than the bad guy's. once i tried ramming him head on and it took out half my life and less than 10% of his. and the cars are slow and boring. dont buy it. if u think its gonna be good rent it first, because once u rent it you wont want it.. guarenteed."
4,Something Different,"WSPC, is a change to the games that are around at the moment, so if you want something different then this is the game for you. Throughout the game you will have acess to 13 different vehicels, which you will get to use on 20 different miaaions. Overall this game is good, its not too easy and poses a bit of a challenge, but one of the best features is the two player co-operative mode.(it means you dont have to be so competitive)"
3,"More, please, Sir?","I really did like this game and it was alot of fun. However I was disappointed in the mere 20 missions they give you. The missions range from the simply cheezy beginners stuff to the nearly impossible, ""Tank Rush"". A friend and I had this game solved in less than a week. Don't get me wrong! It was fun and action packed, but I think for the price there should have been more missions. That's the only reason I gave it 3 stars. On action, I do give it 5 stars. My mistake: buying it brand spankin new. My advice is to wait awhile til the price goes down then it will be truly worth it. - but that's just me..."
3,Its OK,"I don't know how anyone can rate this over 3. I like it because I am a cop, but the handling bites and the acceleration can be better. There are too many bad guys on the streets too. You should be able to just drive around for a while and not chase anyone. I'm trying not to knock the game, but they could have given it better graphics too."
4,Pretty good Game,This game is pretty good overall. Even though the graphics are terrible it is still a fun game to play over and over again. I would buy this game.
2,Halloween mishap,"The order said child, that means toddler. Then the sequins fell off & am still finding them everywhere. On a positive note: the price was good."
1,TOO SMALL FOR MOST CHILDREN,"These really are too small for any child and should not be recommended for anyone over 3-4 years old. I bought for a 7 year old girl and only fit 3/4 of way over her shoes. We could not use them at all. Great price and a great idea, but not for anyone over 4 years old."
2,Cute but Not durable,The shoe covers were different sizes and did not stay in place. The bows came off some shoes prior to the tots going on stage. As they began to dance the shoe cover came off. They are cute but good for dress up only.
2,What was remastered?,"They claim this was remastered. If it was remastered, it was not from the original recordings. It carries the same flaw that has plagued every cd release of this album. Approximately 1.5 minutes into All Along The Watchtower, Andy sings,""All Along..Oohh"", and in the word ""Along"", it sounds as if someone bumped into the reel. This flaw does not exist on my Original 1978 vinyl release on Virgin International. If you do not own this album on cd, then buy it. If you own it on cd, don't bother."
2,"particle board with ""wicker"" cover","Just received this trunk. It's not a true wicker trunk, but rather is particle board with a thin ""wicker"" (appears to be woven plastic) cover. The coloring is unevenly applied, and the mechanism to hold it open is cheap and doesn't work as well as it should. That being said, it is fairly attractive, with a simple design. Probably wouldn't buy again."
3,Attractive but awkward to use,"I love the look of this giant, well-made pillow, but after owning it for months have concluded that it aggravates my neck problems. For lying in bed to read or watch TV, the pillow simply doesn't provide sufficient support; I find that I need to jig additional pillows in and around this one, which becomes a bit silly given the scale of the DinosaurBones pillow. Those without neck issues might enjoy it, but it would be worth trying somehow to simulate its shape and test it before ordering, given its massive size and the difficulty of returning it once it has arrived."
3,my product.,i have not received anything at all. i will like to know if my product was send to my addrees. i appreciate your colaboration.
3,Not Mizuno's Best Batting Glove,"My wife and I have each had two previous iterations of Mizunno Batting Gloves (most recently the original Techfire). Tried this glove when our old ones wore out, mainly because we hadn't found any batting gloves we liked in local stores, it was reasonably priced, and available for prime shipping. It is an alright glove but seems more cheaply made than our previous ones. Neither of us liked it enough so we went ahead and ordered the newer version of the Techfire despite the extra cost."
3,decent gloves.,"Decent gloves for the price, but don't last very long with heavy use (such as a high school player). Very comfortable. Just wish they would last longer."
2,Not built like Lego,"My kids were getting very frustrated with the connections of masts and hulls. They are very poorly designed and ""pressure"" fit to a point where they easily pop off. Both boats - the Royal Dutchman and Black Pearl - have poor fitting. Compared to lego, the ability for parts to connect and stay connected is extremely poor.I plan to write a letter to Mega Blocks about this quality issue."
3,Looks good on display,"It really does look cool when it's all put together, the detail is incredible, BUT- if your child wants to actually play with it, that's another story. The pieces don't hold together near as well as Lego blocks. In fact, I had to resort to using Lego blocks to brace pieces so that the ship doesn't fall apart every time my son touches it. He still loves it- I'm just tired of putting it back together every thirty minutes or so because he can't get it to stay in one piece..."
3,A very average profiling study,"This book started out with what I found kind of a stagey premise....with Vorpagel ""teaching"" a class of profiling students. There were some moments of interesting reading, but suddenly, in the final quarter of the book, Vorpagel and Harrington suddenly veered directly off the track of murder and profiling and went into two incredibly boring stories that had nothing to do with profiling at all. I'm beginning to wonder if anything is being written anymore, as far as forensic profiling, that says anything new. And I am also puzzled by the sheer number of these books lately that have veered far afield of their supposed topics. I found this a VERY average book."
4,Fruit Bread,Christmas gift for my daughter. It is what she wanted so hopefully she likes it. Shipped and arrived on time.
1,Useless don't waste your money,"No material of substance. Don't waste your time or money. Look somewhere else. ""The Idea Hunter"" by Andy Boynton is a better book."
2,Poorly written,"I was expecting much more from this book but found that it contained no more than basic concepts that are common to most people and, poorly written. The book has several incomplete sentences and sentences that are so poorly constructed that the reader really has no idea of what the author is trying to say, no matter how many time the passage is read. He also used the wrong word in several instances, were for we're or, there for their, for instance.This book could be a useful tool for anyone who is seeking to become more creative in their approach to problem solving, but it is in dire need of a good editor to make it not just readable, but to bring out the author's ideas so they are much more clear and understandable."
3,Very Limited in Scope.,A short book like this deserves a short review. This book is less about technique and more about procedure. Young's most important point is that new ideas come about through making connections with other disparate ones. Apart from that the book reads more like an ad man's notebook and is very dated. Historically interesting but of limited use.
4,movie review,This was ordered as a Christmas gift for my sister who collects gnomes. A perfect present since she loved the movie and has many gnomes in her garden.
1,Ending Overly Happy,"My tween daughter who loves all kinds of movies, including the young stuff said, ""It wasn't good. The ending was too happy- I mean OVERLY happy""!"
1,"Flat humor, Tons of Dialogue, Boring","The title sums it up. Before the movie made it to the mid point our daughter was board and asking for another viewing of Tangled. At no point did I even crack a smile at the humor. Simply put, this is a bad movie for all ages."
1,gnomeo and juliet,"once the movie plays it ok, but for some reason when you put it in the dvd player it has an extremly hard time trying to read it. my dvd plays any other dvd just fine, when you look at the back of gnomeo and juliet it doesnt appear to have any scatches, it just for some reason doesnt read good."
3,Cute for kids,"Some children's movies I enjoy almost as much as my kids, but this one does lack a bit of humor and great lines. Still a sweet movie and worth the price."
2,Waste of a 3D movie,"Good movie!...reminds one of a Toy Story movie.Fun movie with a cute love story..If you like Elton John music,you'll love this movie,if not don't watch.All the music is Elton John.The 3D in this movie was forgotten!..This is the 1st 3D movie in which i didn't feel more involved...no wow factors,i checked to see if my glasses where on a couple of times,some parts in the grass look good,but thats it...The 2D is just as good as the 3D...I give the movie 4 stars and the 3D 2 stars.SEE ALL MY 3D REVIEWS:THANKS!"
2,It falls flat...,"So, my daughter and I settled in to watch this film the other night, and I have to admit I was excited. It looked really cute and colorful and vibrant and energetic and just a total distraction, which is what I was hoping for. Instead, I got something remarkably bland in moments, boring almost, that didn't add enough variance to create something special. This is sad, because this really could have become something truly epic; instead it settled for mediocre. That isn't to say that the film doesn't have some merit. The voice work is nicely played by the entire cast, and that Elton John/Lady Gaga original song (Hello, Hello) is fun and plays at the right moment to create a dash of charisma, but in the end this film fails to live up to my expectations (which were, arguably, too high). The age old tale of Romeo and Juliet has been tampered with numerous times; countless times to be honest. Maybe it's time we let it be."
1,Boring,"When I saw the posters for Gnomeo & Juliet, before the movie came out in theaters, I was excited! I thought the movie would be cute and something unique, since nobody has created a video on the Shakespearian play, with gnomes before. I came out of the theater highly disappointed. The movie was very cheesy, it was corny through out the whole film and boring. If you watch the movie you will see what I'm talking about!"
4,Slightly disappointed,Upon further review it stated it was the Canadien version in the description but not the title. It was a bit of an unpleasant suprise upon arrival but disc plays fine
5,"Funny, NOT FOR THREE YEAR OLDS","We read lots of reviews and we got the impression this movie was for three year olds. We watched it anyway. THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR THREE YEAR OLDS. Of course, they would enjoy it, but the point is that a twelve year old could still like it(me). My sister and I really enjoyed this movie and it was funny and creative. They are smart with words and imagery."
4,I am Sugar Artist,"I love the art of piping, the time it takes and the skill is becoming a lost art with all the sloppy, quick decorating you see on grocery store cakes."
2,Was this supposed to be serious?,"I recently rented this after it had been banned and hailed as the ""original video nasty"". And I was not dissapointed, it was as funny and silly as I would've expected from a film about some idiot runnig round New York with a drill. It was first class cheesy horror B-movie rubbish. But then i pondered, was this cheesy rip off on Taxi Driver supposed to be serious, and if it was iyt failed on all points. It is the most corny film I've ever seen, which isnt so bad for a film which doesn't take itself too seriously like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but when it tries to be clever like this (and henry: portrait of a serial kiiler) it just fails."
2,"Gritty, controversial but hollow: 4/10","It's hard to imagine how this film gained its notorious status(especially in the UK). It is poorly shot(reflecting its miniscule budget) and is really no more violent than any other horror film. True, when the disgruntled artist Reno(played by first-time director Abel Ferrara) first goes on a rampage armed with a drill and 'porto-pak', the film does manage to touch a raw nerve, but soon it descends to laboriously-paced repetition and struggles to hold attention.Will be remembered as the debut feature of director Ferrara, who has since never been afraid to court controversy with films like Ms. 45 and Bad Lieutenant; and probably as one of the films that sparked off the 'Video Nasty' hysteria in the UK in the 1980's; but for little else."
3,Brilliance of the unintentional kind!,"I was one of the many Brits to run out and get this film as soon as its ban had been lifted, expecting it to be an amazingly gory and violent horror film. Whilst I was disappointed in that area, the film still satisfied me immensely! It has to be one of the most inept and pretentious films I've ever seen. The plot and characters have absolutely no substance, and the performances are beyond bad.Ferrara has created something that me and my friends just love to sit and laugh our heads off at. It's obvious that he intended all his monologues to be deep and profound, but they're just side-splitting!""Whaddyou know about painting? Lemme tell you what you know - you don't know nothin' about painting!"""
1,Driller Killer,"How horrible! I waited years to see this (it's only now allowed to be seen in Britain again) and was so dissapointed. Let's face it..Abel Ferrara movies are crap..he's probably the most over-rated independent director around and Bad Lieutenant his most over-rated movie. The only films of his worth seeing are Ms 45 and Dangerous Games (only because it's the only film ever that Madonna acts well in). Budget restrictions aside, this is still grimy, cheap exploitation (nothing wrong with that) that tries to pass itself off as 'art'. Watch it once but don't add to your collection."
1,Save your money - all info is on the internet!,I have this book and Wagner's book. Many of the designs are unusable for a wide variety of reasons. Plus you can get more info in an old issue of Speaker Builder magazine - check ebay or Audio Amateur Publications. More up-to-date and practical information can be found in audio forums. I have built ESLs and they are not that difficult or costly to build. Do a little research and add a good measure of common sense!
2,why do you like this book??,"I can't understand why this book is getting good reviews from amazon readers. It's vacant. I expected her love story, and that would maybe have made a better book. But she sure didn't share much of her story (or maybe she's not much of a writer; she's an actress afterall). Who cares what average Dr Therapist has to say? I sold my copy already.Just go to a bokstore and browse it there and leave it there. There's a better book on this topic, that actually TELLs you something."
2,Moto-X,"Lets see I really dont like the game at all, it gets boring quick its just not one of THQs good games.The gameplay is ok but thats about it."
3,Interesting but far-fetched,"I found David R. Bunch's Moderan to be a unique and interesting perspective on a futuristic world, but much of it lacks plausibility. All things considered, it can be said that it's a good read."
4,sparkle,This ankle bracelet is not as dainty as the last one I had but it is going to hold up much better I beleive. It is cute and sparkly. Good value for the money!
4,Very Sparkly,This ankle bracelet is beautiful and was exactly as described.The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star was because the ring that attaches to the clasp is not as thick as the rest of the anklet. I would hate to have this fall off!
2,Pretty but cheaply made,"This anklet was really pretty. I liked it and wore it all the time. Then, it was made so cheaply that it broke. Not good. I wouldn't recommend it."
5,A Timeless Classic,"I acquired my first copy of ""Handling the Big Jets"" during my university days when studying aeronautical engineering (at Loughborough University of Technology, Leicestershire, England) in the early 1980s. This was an excellent reference book then on handling jets as it covered all the major topics that I needed comprehensively, in simple and easy to read language and explanations.However, decades later, it is difficult to find a similar definitive book on the subject. This makes ""Handling the Big Jets"" an important part of my library which I consult on subjects ranging from aerodynamics to aircraft control and stability.This is a timeless classic which should be an indispensable part of every pilot and aircraft engineer's library."
4,a little more info,the blade came dull and its what i was sorta expecting. i had to get it honed at a shop . no biggy. just a little more infor on what kind of metal it is and all that would be nice for people who would actually use this. other than that full on ya
5,Ramona the Pest,"Ramona always gets in trouble. In Ramona the Pest, Ramona is in trouble with her friends and at school. At school she gets in trouble when she tripped Howie. Howie was sitting down and he was going to get up. Ramona was Right next to him so she stuck her foot out.She also got in trouble when she pulled Daisy's hair. Daisy told the teacher on her. Ramona triped Henry when he was the Safety. He fell down. Ramona always gets in trouble! That is why this book is intersting to me.You should buy this book becuase this book is funny. It is funny when she finds a worm on the playground and decides to keep it."
4,This is a great book,I think Ramona the Pest is a good book!Because it is really funny and it kind of makes you think about when we were kids.I would recamend this book to anyone whether young or old ....I dont no how many times I have read this book.and it never made me boored!
3,my review,"this book is very cute. although it isnt that page turning. i rate this book a three because beverly cleary is a great writer and the misgif that ramona gets into is never ending! but you got to love these good classics. also starring selena gomez ramona and beezus the movie is on dvd its such an inspiring story of two sisters its a must watch! anyways back to the book you can by it if you think you are going to like it, it's not a ""must"" buy. ~alyssa monroe pa"
4,Ramona the Pest is GREAT!,"I am in second-grade. My teacher read this book to us in class, and I liked it so much I read it myself. It's about a little girl who is always doing everything wrong. A lot of parts are funny. One funny part was when Ramona stuck her tongue out at her neighbor because she asked if her tongue was glued to her mouth because she wasn't speaking. She has an older sister Beezus who is sometimes a big tattle-tale. Anyway, I really liked the book and now I am reading ""Ramona and her Mother."" Madeleine, age 8."
4,Growing Up Lessons,"Ramona Quimby, youngest child in the household, is finally going to kindergarten, an event she has looked forward to for . . . well, maybe as much as a full year out of her five-year-old's life. Kindergarten is everything Ramona thought it would be, and more. She loves her teacher. She also loves pulling the hair of Susan, the girl who sits in front of her. When her teacher will no longer tolerate Ramona's hair-pulling, Ramona has a big decision to make: does she want to continue kindergarten, which means not pulling Susan's hair. Or does she want to stay home, which means being isolated from her classmates. A kind action from her teacher helps Ramona make the right decision. A sweet story."
2,Ramona Quimby IS a Pest,"Ramona the Pest is simply about a 5-year-old kid being a pest, right? Well, it's more than that. The author does take us into the mind of a kindergartener, but Beezus (the oldest sister) has a reason for calling Ramona a pest. She is! First of all, Ramona is spoiled and thinks that everyone's against her, and anytime she wants something, she knows--if she cries--her mother will listen to her. Ramona Quimby is a brat and I'm glad to see she's grown-up, because Ramona Quimby is nothing but a whiner and spoiled brat! Consider this before handing it to your child. I'm 13...I know these things. My little sister agrees with me.(Remember, this is just an opinion)"
2,Comical,"This movie is nice for your zombie collection, But dont buy it if you expect the high end quality of the classics. Im not sure if they were going with a comedy angle, But it sure plays out that way in the horrific acting, Bad special effects, And a total lack of a managable story line. This movie is an MST3K movie waiting to be made."
4,On The Backroads of Tuscany,"This is a lovely video, however it is only 30 minutes and does not concentrate long enoug on any one place. Had I known it was so short I would not have ordered it for the price."
2,Not what I expected,My computer is too big to safely sit on top of this unit. Seems a throw back to the old PC days.
3,"Would be cute, but....","The story is engaging, but the dozens of guns on every page really turned me off."
5,I love this unit!!!,"I ordered the Crosley Songwriter CD Recorder for my mom for Mother's Day.She has about a million records that we wanted to put on CDs. And I've got to say that over the last week, I've recorded about 25 CDs (and also a few cassette tapes), and absolutely love this unit! Cassettes, records, and CDs all play equally well, as does the radio. My experience with the Crosley has been such that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone."
3,Beautiful. But came with missing needle and 45 converter.,This is a beautiful equipment. But it came with missing parts. Contacted amazon and the told me They could refund me if I sent the item back. Since I had already broken the box I decided to buy the needle and the 45 converter at an electronics store and got it with no problem. After this it works great.
5,Great item,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas, my husband has a huge record collections, he has been busy recording them to cd. The first one we received had a defect, but when I called the company they were so helpfull, and within two day's we had a new one, they even took care of the shipping charge to send it back. I would not hesitate to buy this again, and I will try to go to this company for anything else their service was excellent."
1,crosley,this crosley songwriter looked very nice but didn't perform well at all.i had to keep pushing the buttons to get it to run and when I tried to record an album onto a cd at first it didn't want to start it kept telling me there was no cd then when it did say it was recording it only recorded 2 songs from the album i returned it and will be looking for another recorder other then crosley
1,Poor recorder.,"I don't recommend this product to anyone. It is easy to use, however, the sound is horrible. It is noisy and has a loud humming sound to the finished CD. Also, the background is horrible. The first one I bought I returned because I couldn't even hear the songs on the CD. the second one is a tiny bit better, but it still very disappointing. I am not planning on using it much. I haven't even tried the cassette player yet. It has one thing for it. The cabinet is pretty! DON""T BUY IT!!!"
1,There's Something BAD About Mary,"This is one of the worst ""comedy's"" i've ever seen. I've watched it twice and i still can't find anything funny about it. Everything that may have been funny was shown in the previews, and everything else was predictable. You can guess everything that's going to happen. The directors should have just made Dumb and Dumber and stopped, that's their only funny movie so far."
5,Hilarious Movie,"This is one of the most clever comedies in a century. This ranks up with Spaceballs, The Spy Who Shagged Me, and Tommy Boy. Ben Stiller looks very funny in this movie because his ears stick out a lot."
1,I hated this movie!,"If I could have given it 0 stars, I would have. I don't know what everyone else saw in this movie. I thought it was one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen."
1,A HUGE disappointment,"I WAITED for this to come out on DVD because several people had told me how absolutely hilarious it was...NOT. I have to side with the other reviews who found it juvenile, bland, boring and slow. If you saw the previews for this movie on television, don't bother, you've seen the funny parts."
5,Great for those who understand the comedy,I have read all of the other comments and laghed along with the great comments but was a little upset with the one raters. In this movie you have to understand the comedy.. not that you have to be a teen but the comedy is not for your average person. It's for the people that like outrageous unusual comedy like the scene with the dog or witht the hair gel. And the story is great too especially the end where all the guys who like her are in her house. It is SO FUNNY! If you know what comedy is.. you'll enjoy this!!!!
1,What an appalling movie !,"I listened to the hype but borrowed the DVD before I bought it. I am so glad I did - one of the worst films I've seen in ages. The whole theme of guys trying to get their leg over is far better done in Notting Hill. There are about 2 funny moments in this film and even then I found myself embarrassed about laughing (well, sniggering) at them."
3,"Funny, twice laugh out loud.","This movie was just funny. Not absolutely screamingly funny as all of America said. If the Farrelly brothers had left the idea of... well, let me say this: It can be summarized in a few sentences: Boy likes girl in high school. 13 years years pass by, and he hires a detective to hunt her down. He finds her, gets to like her, and from there, things happen. If they'd gone with only that idea, without the comedy, it would be a good, straight movie. VERY TASTELESS HUMOR. NOT FOR KIDS. Too much foul language for a comedy, but you'll get over it. The whole movie is smile-through, the dog scenes being laugh out loud. Rent it or see it on HBO."
1,Forget the hype...... this movie is horrible.,"This is one of the most atrocious attempts at filmmaking that I have ever witnessed in my life. This movie was even worse than, ""Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion"". That is saying alot since I would rather have my face rammed into a brick wall 100 times than see that again. Anyway, this movie is just dumb. The jokes and gags are not funny, the characters are annoying and basically you can get more entertainment from staring at a blank wall for 6 hours. I don't know why everyone keeps dumping out their love for this movie on me. Just stop it. Now."
2,Very dissapointing movie,"Everyone had raved about how incredibly funny this movie was, so I went in with an open mind, and hoping to have a good laugh... I didnt laugh once during the whole movie and cant figure out what all the fuss was about. I can appreciate raunchy junior high level humor, but while this movie had the raunchiness, and the junior high maturity, it seriously lacked in the humor department. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because the actors did a good job.. everything else about it was completely dissapointing. After a long while, I even tried to watch it again to see if I had just been in a bad mood the first time, or somehow didnt get it, but I couldnt make it through it a second time without turning it off. Obviously lots of people loved it, so all I can say is dont buy it if you havent seen it, rent it first, and then decide whether or not you want to waste your money."
3,an OK comedy,"The creators of this movie have to practice some more to reach the level of the Zucker brothers. There are some funny scenes in the movie (like a testicle caught in zipper or spermahairgel), but the jokes are placed in the movie like 5 minutes apart and the romantic side of this comedy is pretty standard and boring. The characters are also below average and poorly developed. To summarize: this movie is for teenagers looking for cheap sporadic laughs."
2,But what IS it about Mary?!,"I don't get it! Did all these people who gave There's Something About Mary four and five stars see a different movie than I did? I found nothing clever or groundbreaking about its sexual humor; it just lowered the bar for everyone else! (For example, compare 1997's mildly racy Austin Powers to 1999's [post-Mary] excessively raunchy Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.) I didn't find anything heartfelt or romantic about it, either; I wonder if the people who say they did are actually responding to Jonathan Richman's songs?"
1,What a stupid movie!,This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Why did they have to make a movie about a geeky kid trying to get a guy hired to go look for his old girlfriend. I think that's a dumb idea. Cameron Diaz is pretty hot in this movie but the whole movie is just plain dumb. When I first saw this movie in the theater I thought it was allright but now that I watched it so many times on video it has gotten boring and stupid. If you want to see a movie that's more funnier go rent American Pie that movie's hilarious. Stay far away from this movie it's dumb!
1,"Funny movie, terrible amazon unbox service","The movie is hilarious, funny 12 years ago, just as funny now. The amazon unbox service was horrible. Wanted to watch this on new years eve, but it took 8 hours to download. The Internet connection was fine, I even restarted my computer. Google it, tons of people have had the same slow download speed if not worse.Love using amazon, but I'm staying away from their video service."
1,Dissappointing fare!,"This is a tasteless, vulgar movie with pretensions to being funny. There are countless other movies made along similar lines ( man secretly overhearing girl's idea of the right man and pretending to be one ) which are genuinely funny, but this one makes you sick."
2,Hmmm...,"My, my, my... What a disappointment that was... I never got around to seeing the film while it was in theaters, but I kept hearing from friends how great it was. Finally, a nice friend loaned me her DVD and I just watched it. Plain and simple: IT WASN'T FUNNY! It wasn't all that interesting either. Everything about it was so predictable. This turned out to be one of those the-previews-tell-the-entire-story pictures. At least I got some laughs out of the previews."
1,It sucked.,"Funniest movie of the year? You have got to be kidding. Cameron was so snobby. She was all like, ""No, i like this team better and so do you so i'll dump him and like you."" It was stupid, and suck. If their was 0 stars then thats what i'd put it under."
1,The Farrellys miss one,This is not funny. Sure you have the tacky (intended) hair gel scene...but that was not funny enough to save this boring film. I mean what is the point....middle class America is boring and tries to get thru with a little juvenile wit....we know that already...no need to waste time or money to be told again by a couple guys that can and have done a lot better.
3,Wonderful,Justly as good as 45years ago. A real joy which should be introduced to all children farm 6 to 60
5,Absolutely Gorgeous artwork!,"This artist's pencilwork is stunning! If you don't have a version of ""'Twas the Night Before Christmas,"" make sure this is the one you buy. The pencil drawings are absolutely luminous and bring a new element to the story. Even if you have several versions of this classic story, this version is a must have!"
3,classic poem but wacky formatting,"This is a charming poem, a Christmas classic, and a wonderful price (free), but the formatting is off. Unlike anything else I have downloaded from the kindle store, this poem breaks into stanzas instead of words. So, display in larger fonts causes some lines to be hidden and individual words cannot be selected for highlighting or lookup."
4,"Good value, acceptable quality","We were looking for an over-sized ""Night Before Christmas"" book to read to our little ones on Christmas eve. This one does the trick and quality is good for the ~$15 price. Calling it an ""heirloom edition"" might be stretching it a bit though."
3,A little too much,"This book is so big that it's unwieldy for reading to my kids. It seems more suited for libraries or schools where group read alouds are more common. It's a beautiful edition, I just wish they'd scaled it down a bit."
1,Poor quality,I was greatly disappointed with this item. Nearly every page was torn. Some drawn on & some had tape over the pictures. I bought this as a gift and I am hugely disappointed. The book couldn't even function.
2,Book's animotion is barely viewable.,The animotion is very dark and can barely be seen. It totally ruins the book. I will not be able to use it. It would have worked better to just had regular pictures.
5,Tradition,We bought this edition of The Night Before Christmas the year after our son was born. He'll be 4 on Christmas Eve. It has become a tradition for my husband to read this to me and our son just before we put him to bed on Christmas Eve. It is a beautiful book with beautiful illustrations. I just absolutely love it :)
4,Wonderful for children,I bought this book for my nephew and he was really fascinated with the colors. Hopefully he will learn how to move the page to see the holographic pictures.
3,It was just okay,"For a Kindle book it was ok and it met the need since we couldn't find our book. However, no electronic copy of the Night Before Christmas will ever compare with a well done book in your hand."
2,THe night before christmas,I had forgotten about the order and just about the time I wasthinking of it it came next day.Excellent service.With some of these online purchases they don't work and causeproblems but Amazon seem to come through. It's a bit of a riskordering online so I was very pleased. I have been looking for aChristmas book I had as a child and this seem closest.The shipping is high tho for Canadians.Georgina S Frazer
1,This book has no business being for sale.,"This book seems to have 4 or 5 versions of the story being told all at once, and out of order. The pictures didn't correlate to the text. It was completely confusing and very frustrating, as I was really looking forward to reading the timeless tale to my daughter on Christmas Eve night. A blind and deaf person must have put the book together. It is the only explanation."
5,Great Product,Excellent choice for my application. Very bendable and just the right size. Would recommend this product to other users who restore old cars.
2,Not Suitable for IBM Test 158,"Though IBM recommends this, DO NOT buy this for the Test 158. The best thing to do is to download the FREE pdfs Websphere 4.0 App Server Handbook, and 'EJB with VisualAge', print them and study those. I wasted my money."
5,Simply Beautiful,"I originally bought this book for myself. There is something about this book that pulls you in, and makes you want to own it. The combination of the author's story and Tim Brown's artwork is magical. After reading Bark and Tim to my daughter for the first time, she took over my copy and now likes to keep it beside her at night. She says she wants to sleep with Bark. It definitely has both adult and kid appeal.Would also make a great gift to anyone who loves art, dogs, picture books, or just a good, unique story.When you're done enjoying the book, don't forget to read the author's note at the end. The story of their collaboration with Tim Brown is worthy of its own book. It's a fascinating story."
3,"Good start, then weakens","Pro:-Interesting introduction to visual factory... for a few chapters-Coverage of the most popular visuals, including a description of kanban, andon, etc.-Some unique perspectives that I had not seen before which was very refreshingCon:-Verbose at times... descriptions are eloquent but overly (and unnecessarily?) lengthy-Virtually no visuals. What visuals there are, they are either poor drawings or grainy black and white photos.-Too much emphasis on the automotive industry I think hurt the bookBottom line: read the first few chapters with enthusiasm, skim or skip the rest."
1,another reason to hate the south #2,"this is exactly the reason why i left. people who act so backwards, who have nothing to talk about except their rides, how much money they have and how many women they done freaked...so much of rap has become like this and this is why i don't buy much of it....."
5,Luda,"Ludacris is awesome. It seems the more i hear this cd the more i like. It never gets old. The best songs are Saturday, Oh no, Cold Outside, Roll Out and Move .... This cd got me to like Luda alot. I wasnt crazy about his first hit he came out with (Whats your fantasy) and afta that hit i neva thought i would like him but them came Roll Out and you cant get to much betta than that. I love blazin to it. Well worth the money to buy it. I dont know to many people that would disagree!"
2,Disappointing,"Wow, i had high expectations for this but they definatly came up short. Only songs i'm really into are roll out, welcome 2 america, and growing pains. I just wasn't feelin the rest. plus i'm not a big fan of him puttin songs that aren't his on the cd. stuff like welcome to atlanta and area codes shouldn't be on there. and then taking stuff from kilo ali ""she said she's never done it, she said she never tried, she's sitting there telling a mutha f-ing lie"" oh well. at least the dungeon family cd is tiiiiiiight."
2,"l love Ludacris, and Carson Daly","If you are in middle school, this album is for you, literally. If you're not, (or even if you are) you don't have to listen to what MTV and Pepsi tell you to. Check out some real hip hop: Blackalicious, Talib Kweli, MF Doom. Ludacris sure does make me want to buy jewelry and american made SUV's though!"
5,Talented Rapper,"I got this for my birthday back in January and haven't gotten a chance to review it...'till now. Anyway, the CD was so hot I couldn't take it out my CD player. The whole CD grabs your attention. [There are only 2 songs in which I like]. The rest of the songs had tight beats and sick flows. I love 'em all. My favorites are probably Freaky Thangs, Go 2 Sleep, Cry Babies,... She Said, Block Lockdown, and Keep it on the Hush. I like all the singles, but I've gotten tired of them now. The skits Greatest Hits and Stop Lying are laugh-out-loud funny. Oh yeah, his Word of Mouf freestyle was real good, too. Almost all these songs get you up and dancin', ready to party. Buy this CD!"
3,Some tracks great. Rest I hear Ludacris just talking on the phone to friends.,I will always say Ludacris rocks! But I think that maybe this album could have been polished up a bit.I always equate Ludacris with 2 Fast 2 Furious. Great movie! I hope you enjoy the rest of the tracks in this album.
3,Word of Mouf,"Word of Mouf is better than the first one it's worth the money, it's just after Saturday the album is long and boring.1.Coming to America it's the best song to open this album.""Rollout"" ""Go to Sleep"" ""Cry Babies"" ""Move"" ""Saturday"" are the best songs on the CD. The othersongs are good,but to long.Overall the CD is good."
3,Okay.....,"What's happens to an artist when he gets signed to a major label?Answer: A lot of the power is taken away for commerciality. That is what happened here. Not bad, however, I'm sticking to the up and coming artists who have everything to gain and nothing to lose. Their lyrics ain't written for the radio and won't ever see spin on the airwaves, however they are keeping it real. Check out D.O.W.N. Southern Slang, they also have a chopped and screwed version out.....Bangin' beats and realest rhymes....If your under 18 beware explicit lyrics."
3,Disappointing,I am usually impressed with the Dummy series. There have been only a few exceptions. This is one of them. There is just a lot of stuff missing (which IS in books from the competition) and some of the stuff just goes on and on (enough already!).
5,Sight Singing,"What I asked for, bent rings, old edition so have to use a classmate's book to figure out how the numbers are related."
3,2nd Time's a Charm,"6 years after first hefting this might tome I have finished it. This series ruined my enjoyment oif fantasy for half a decade but it has since been rekindle in the wake of the LOTR revival. Most fantasy novels are fun and magical, but this series is like listening to the life story of a loquacious boor. It plods along for a LOOONG Time and eventually wears out its welcome.Despite all the drawbacks I enjoyed reattacking this book and finally finishing it. I'm looking forward to starting the next one soon.I was a Wheel of Time burnout for several years but I'm glad to be back into the material. If you have lost faith, take a break and come back to the series at a later date. Its still going to be several years until this thing is done. In the meantime I recommend the Death Gate Cycle by Hickman and Weis, for people wanting something different."
3,Not quite what I expected,"The book was listed in ""good"" condition. I knew the book was used but I didn't know it was going to be so WELL used."
4,Nice Job,"Not the best, but Jordan moves the story along. That's more than I can say for his later efforts."
4,1000 pages in the life of the Aiel,"This book is long. I don't like starting any kind of review like that, it simply states the facts. It is a series for people who like long, descriptive books. Still, most long descriptive books contain action. For most of this book, I was waiting for the events of the previous book, which was incredible, to be followed up on. There were the accepted on their journey after the Black Ajah, there was the new army in the Two Rivers, and there was Egwene learning about dreams. None of that was resolved until the next book. Instead, this is all about Rand travelling with the Aiel, occassionally stopping on the increasingly uninteresting travels of Nynaeve and Elayne. Still, all of that changes suddenly, when the book pull an about face, and a memorable battle occurs, leaving a suprising number of victories for the ta'varen. Like any good journey, the Wheel of Time Books are long and tedious, but the end is always worth it."
4,Pretty Cool,"Although this wasn't one of my favorite books in the story it was still informative. Rand goes is STILL in the Aiel Waste which is tiring, but his bond with Aviendha grows and becomes love. but this is the book that starts the series sex scenes too. yuck! and there is a forsaken fight! yes! I find the fights between Nyneave, Elayne, Birgette, and Valan Luca or whatever his name is quite humorous. And Nyneave's love craving for lan romantic. Though at the end the when Rand reaches Cairheien, he is suprised at the death of Moiraine and Asmodean. Fortunate for your guessing purposes, it leaves you stumped with 2 questions*Who killed Asmodean?*Is Moiraine really dead?But you will have to read the other books to get more clues!"
2,"Ouch, not close to TSR","After coming off a great like The Shadow Rising I expected something much better than what was delivered by the long and boring Fires of Heaven. In TFOH Rand searches for the Shaido and the False Car'a'carn, Couladin. While Rand is going mad Mat is puzzling over what to do about Aes Sedai, what happened to him in Rhuidean, a hot Aiel chick, And two dorrways into different worlds. Egwene continues to be taught of dreamwalking and Aiel customs by The Wise Ones while Elayne and Nyneave hunt Black Ajah and hide from one of the Forsaken. One of the worst parts of this book is that one of my favorite characters, Perrin, is only mentioned in passing and plays no other role. Bottom Line: suffer throgh this book. Hopefully Lord of Chaos will be better."
3,"Remembered her words, but forgot the story.","This book is good to point where I remember Moiraine's last words and I forget the whole plot of the story. Probably becuase there was no plot (I don't think). But there is a part that touched my heart in the story that could make me give it 3 stars. Read the book, then find out for yourself."
1,"Long, dull, and repetitive","The series started out fine with The Eye of the World. The next installment continued the plot well. After that, however, the Wheel of Time spun slowly and stayed in one place.Now, it wasn't the length of the book that put me off - I love longer books. But when the storyline just drawls on, the bulk of the book makes you groan. The descriptions are vague, and everything seems to repeating itself. Nothing gets anywhere! The women are mad at the men for trivial things, the men are mad at the women for even stupider things, and all of the books seem to end in the exact same place as the previous installment. I nodded off before Jordan could draw breath for his next rant.Best to just cut the books off quickly."
4,slowing down,The story starts to slow down in this book. There are a lot of characters in a lot of different places. Be prepared to start consulting the appendix.
3,Almost 4 stars,"This book is filled with wonderful action and suspense and decent character development. The introduction of some new characters is done quite nicely as well. Jordan has a gift for putting the people in his books in seemingly impossible situations and then extracting them from those situations in ways that are both suprising and plausible. I found myself wondering if we were going to lose an important character so often that I was genuinely suprised when we did. I have two major problems with this book that most reviews have already covered 1)no Perrin, big mistake 2)for all the pages and events in the book, the story itself doesn't seem to move forward. I found myself going with this edition of the story waiting for some important payoff. I was dissapointed that it never came. I'll give the next one a shot because I've come this far, but I hope to see some resolution soon. Still a good book."
5,Very Enjoyable,"I bought this book for my brother's Christmas present. Having some spare time on my hands, I thought I'd read a few pages... Three days later I finished the book and loved it. I haven't read any other adventure books so I have nothing similar to compare it to, but it sure kept me hooked. Colin turns a journey of chaos and uncertainty into silky prose that will satisfy the non-adventurers. It's an entertaining way to learn about Mongolia and Siberia."
1,What a terrible book!,"There are errors of fact on every page, sometimes in every paragraph! For one example, the pages on Kay Swift, George Gershwin, and Can't We Be Friends? have more than fifty wrrors. What a terrible book, a complete cut and paste job from canned sources with errors added for originality! No editing whatsoever? Shocking."
2,Inaccurate vanity press product,"The book covers about thirty songs. The one song that I know the history of is totally incorrect!! Jimmy Van Heusen told me in 1979 that he co-wrote the song that we know as ""Nancy"" with Phil Silvers on the 20th Century lot. It was written as ""Bessie with a laughing face"". Bessie was the wife of Jimmy's partner, Johnny Burke. Later they used it at birthday parties for other woman...and finally at little Nancy Sinatra's fourth B-day. Frank cried...thinking they wrote it for her. This author claims Frank co-wrote it with Jimmy and Phil for Nancy."
5,Great Book,"Great book, just what I needed for class and it was cheap so that helped out a lot with the budget"
2,"A different, lesser, Sayers","Thought I'd read all of Dorothy Sayers' mysteries years ago, but never got around to this one before; turns out I hadn't missed anything all that time. Not a Lord Peter Wimsey story, but does take place in the same universe -- there's a minor character who's also a minor character in the Lord Peter corpus, and I think there was a throwaway line in a Lord Peter story referring to this murder.It's a gimmick book: it's not presented as a traditional 3rd-person narrative but as a collection of personal letters, newspaper articles, memoranda, and sworn statements. The gimmick is cute, but not successful: too much of the book (especially in the second half) is carried by the sworn statements, which are sufficiently story-telling to make it mostly a 1st-person story (albeit told from a couple different 1st-person points of view). And as a mystery it's very lightweight, and too broadly given away."
5,Underrated movie!,"I really enjoyed this movie when it came out and was quite surprised by all the bad reviews. I had read the book several years before I saw the movie and thought they did a great job of transfering it to film.The funny thing is that most reviews criticize the film makers for their wierd story choices, but the film was just following the book.Others criticize that the movie doesn't know whether to be a comedy, action thiller or an adventure story? The book was the same way and I thought the book and film did a great job of juggling these different styles."
4,Hopkins 47795,"I bought this to hook up a Tekonsha 90195 P3 brake controller so I had to splice the Tekonsha specific end on, but this did give me more length which was needed in my case. And the wire colors matched up, which was nice. I took one star because it did not have the wires wrapped as shown in the picture.You do have to plug one wire into the brown end depending on the year of the truck, directions are on the package."
2,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to some great reading and fun ideas for quality crafts and stories, but what I received I almost threw away with all the fliers that Amazon sends with your order. This ""book"" looks like it was typed on an old typewriter, photocopied and stapled together.I skimmed through it and then managed to read through about half of it before it disappeared. (I'm guessing it got mixed-up with other papers that were taken to the recycling center) From what I did read this ""book"" had very little that was new to me. I give it 2 stars only because the writer was faithful to the customs without the usual hyped-up, romantic-type ideas that tend to fill up books of this genre.I suppose if this item has a drastic price drop, people interested in the culturally based customs of Samhain would enjoy the read, but don't have high expectations. Similar material can be found on the web with a wee bit of time (to sort through the fluff.)"
2,Not very compelling,"This book has a very interesting premise that could have been done better, it can be fast paced at certain points and drag on at others. Hurwitz is a very average writer. His characters are very vanilla, there is nothing new here."
5,definitely thrilled........,"With ""Do No Harm"" Hurwitz has given his readers the suspense and excitement of a psychological thriller melded with the language and grace of a literary work. In this, his third book, Hurwitz demonstrates his ability to climb inside the psyche of his characters and to create complex, three-dimensional personalities. ""Do No Harm"" is a compelling, convincing story about a physician's struggle to maintain his compassion and empathy even when faced with the horrific, violent actions of a sadistic maniac.This skillfully told story is rich with surprises and is sure to keep you thinking long after you've returned it to the shelf."
4,"Good boots, good deal, but yes they are seconds",Love these boots and this is my second pair - paid $215 at a local retailer (stompers boots) but wanted a new second pair in a wider size - so this was a great deal but the shaft of the boots I got here did in fact have significant imperfections in the form of crease marks in the leather. But the marks were about where the boot would crease anyway so from that standpoint the boots are still a wonderful deal.
4,"Re-Discovering Plato, Techne and Aporia","David Roochnik, a former student of Stanley Rosen, provides a clear and persuasive analysis of the use and meaning of techne in Plato. As well, he devotes a chapter to the pre-Platonic inception and transformation of the term. His thesis, even 7 years later, is quite radical as it challenges much of the predominant and conventional ways of understanding Plato as a philosopher seeking a science of moral knowledge. He engages with such promiment scholars as Marthat Nussbaum and T. Irwin. Roochnik's book is a significant contribution to the recent attempt to re-appreciate a philosopher so often seen to be a footnote to modern thinking. Finally, anyone interested in the question of technology will find this study worthwhile and very illuminating of the difference between its ancient form and the current understanding."
2,Editorialized History,"This book could be a valuable addition to the student's library if it wasn't for the obvious editorializing which punctuates the chapters and betrays the author's anti-Catholic bias.A much better source for serious study is the more scholarly work: ""A Concise History of the Catholic Church"" by Thomas Bokenkotter."
3,"Not Good, but Not Bad Either","Dear readers, let us be honest: from a music standpoint, they're not very original. Though hardly the Breaking Benjamin ripoff they've been accused of-for one thing, Soulidium's Michael McKnight doesn't sing in the same warbally key that Ben Burnley goes for.That being said, once you get past McKnight's appearance, the songs are well-crafted, lyrical content is original and his fellow bandmates seem to know their instruments and play them decently. With the exception of ""Easy Kind of Girl"" and ""About You""-a paean about a groupie and a slow song about death, I could imagine myself giving this to a first-time listener without shame."
4,Good Insight Into the Eastern Front,"I purchased this book after reading Grossman's tour de force Life and Fate. This work consists of random snippets from Grossman's notebooks and correspondence as he traveled with the Red Army from 1941-1945. These snippets are placed into historical and geographic context by the translators of his work.At times, the text is captivating and at times horrifying. At others, it seems merely random and poorly organized. The chapter detailing the liberation of Treblinka and Grossman's interviews of the witnesses and survivors was chilling and was read into the record at the war crimes trials at Nuremburg.All in all, this book is a worthwhile read for anyone having an interest in World War II, the Red Army and war in general. Casual readers may not enjoy the experience."
4,Great Gift for kids,I purchased the product as a gift for my grandaughters. They enjoyed drawing with it for quite a while before going home. It was also great for use in the car for the trip home.
1,Same Old Lanza,"If you are a fan of Mario Lanza you'll probably love this collection. I admit I am not a fan. When lanza was living, we Sicilians referred to him as Mario Si Lanza because in the Sicilian language ""si lanza"" meanns ""he throws up."" In other words we had heard the best and Mario for us was NOT the best despite his powerful top. But his singing was so uneven through the ranges and his poor pronounciation of Italian made him not the choice of sophisticated listeners."
4,steren lengthen cables,"excellent hardy well fitting cable for my i pod and small speakers use. fits everywhere almost all plug holes. extends up to 18"" or 3' for adding on speakers, i pod touch hookups, etc. very dependable."
2,Too much of a good thing,"Full of set piece dialogue, the first program was tolerable but thereafter the scenes could be anticipated and clearly were trumpted up stuff, not even remotely possible. British humor at its worse."
1,wrong song list,"I enjoy Jeni Fleming, the problem is with Amazon.com. The sample play list on the Jeni Fleming cd is not the songs that are on the actual cd you purchase. You need to be careful to be sure you are buying the right cd."
1,"good for 101 courses, not for real scholars","The encyclopedia is poorly organized, and too many outdated sources for many entries. Extremely bad for Art Historians! If you want a particular site, one must search for it under its location. Not theme or era. There even isn't an entry for the Romanesque era!! And there isn't any for San Isidoro de León - Panteon de los Reyes. While the writer of ""Historia Silense"" might have known King Ferdinand; the writer wasn't a monk at Sahagun!! He was either at Silos or at Leon. Once again Routledge has proven itself unable in doing a great encyclopedia of the era."
3,"Funny, but what was it about again?","Although I found this novel extremely funny, I had to keep asking myself what it was about. Maybe I am just too dense to get it or I over-analized it. Probably the first. In any case, if the rest of Vonneguts novels are as funny as BOC, I might take a look at them too. I'll make sure to have an interpreter on hand."
1,This book really IS RACIST,"I was sooooooo dissapointed since I am a big fan of Vonnegut's and love his writing style (except in this book), not to mention my favorite character Kilgore Trout. I read some of the reviews and decided to ignore the negative ones since there is so many people out there who clearly miss Vonnegut's point. It is racist, sexist and towards the end he just rambles on pointlessly about things ... that have nothing to do with what he is talking about. I am used to being shocked by Vonnegut but this was too much. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK, it is a waste of time and money."
5,Breakfast of Champions,"This was my first experience of Vonnegut. After a few pages I was thinking he was a bit...Um...""Brain Damaged"". By the time I got to page 50, I saw he was a genius. He is a master at satire. One of the few books I could read over and over again."
5,Kurt Vonnegut equals genius,"anything Kurt has ever written is amazingmy summer going into senior year of high school my summer professor turned me onto him with Cats Cradle. Breakfast of Champions, or Goodbye Blue Monday, far surpasses that novel."
3,Not Vonnegut's Best Work,"I'm definitely a Vonnegut fan, and despite my lack-luster review of this book, it was not enough to detour me from reading more of him. However, this one just didn't hold my interest in the same manner as his others. Yes, Vonnegut delivers satirical social commentary, but for me, it was at a much slower, more disguised pace than his norm. I was not compelled to read the book in one fell swoop as I normally am with a Vonnegut book."
2,Disappointing compared to his other work.,"Though I typically find KV's books very entertaining, this one just didn't do much for me for the first 9/10 of it. Vonnegut usually has some phrase or idea he repeats extensively in his novels; you may remember ""ting-a-ling"" or ""So it goes""; well, in this novel, which is excessively badly pornographic in passing, Vonnegut feels the need to tell you the size of every male character's member upon introduction; It really doesn't serve any central purpose to the story.Two of the key characters, Rabo and Kilgore, are served up much more fascinatingly and entertainingly in other books. He also includes a TON of drawings, which are only necessary maybe one fifth of the time. I guess I believe he has a problem with moderation!"
3,Loved the pictures!,"First of all, I wasn't an English major so I can't talk to you about grand themes and insights. What I would suggest to anyone who hasn't seen this book yet is to just pick it up some where and look at a few of the pictures and read a snippet or two of the book. I can almost guarantee you'll buy it. The humor was great as were the observations. I just finished """"Breakfast of Champions"" and have made it my mission to read the rest of his stuff by the end of summer.I've also found this book helps fend off muggers. After you read it you'll start thinking about it at odd times and places and just break out laughing, which is what I often do at the bus and train stations in Chicago. It's great how people veer away from you when you do that.LOOK AT THE PICTURES!"
2,lagsalot,Vonnegut's anti-modern world narcissism is a boring journey into little minds. Difficult to keep paying attention to it. The drawings / cartoons contribute so little.
5,Best American Critique/Satire in ages.,"This book is by far one of the most artistic books Vonnegut has ever written. Both a very poignant critique of American society and a auto-biography. In fact, it's a book that not only lambasts American lifestyles it's also a critique of Humanity as a whole. It's a satire about human folly and futility. It's About flesh machinery and complacency. It's About superfluous endeavors and non-sense. I never though I would laugh at misery and calamity before in my life , yet as one reads this primer laughing at such things is all but inevitable.On the literary aspect of this book, it possesses the master penmanship one would expect from Vonnegut. It's post-modern meta-fiction at its best. I HIGHLY recommend this title to anyone who's willing to reflect upon his life and who's willing to reflect upon societal values and moral values and human value. Definitely one of Vonnegut's best."
2,Perspectivas Book,"I was happy that my book arrived just in time for our first reading for my Spanish 142 class. But when I received the package and opened it, it smelled funny, and was very tattered. It seems that the previous owner did not take good care of it, and it smells very much like cigarette. And a lot of the pages are heavily drawn on with pencil. Not complaining because I finally have my book, but I would have wanted to know that the book wasn't very well taken care of, and that a lot of the pages were written on and that it smells badly. And the book didn't come with the CD."
2,Worst HD transfer I've seen so far!,"Of course its a classic film. Worst transfer to a ""high-definition"" format that I've seen so far. Just by the DVD, you won't miss the extra static contained in the higher definition version here."
5,Red October,I bought this to replace a VHS version. One of the bestof Sean Connery's work and Alec Baldwin was at ihs best.Looks great on my hi-def TV.
4,Got to love Connery,"Only a Scottsman like Sean Connery [AKA James Bond :-) ] could pull off a Russian sub skipper and right from the opening scene and set the pace for this coldwar thriller. When I first actually read the book I was impressed the plot which I was sure could only end up in some war. When I read that the movie was being made I couldn't image who could play this role well enough until I read it was Bond :-) .I thought that Alex Baldwin did a good job as Jack Ryan, but the acting is over the top at times. Later movies had Harrison Ford in this role and that for me is a better fit...hell he even looks a bit like the pictures of Tom Clancy in shades.All in all its still a great worth while movie all round.I give it 4 out of 5 nukes"
5,Great movie,This is a classic movie. It looked great on my Kindle HD and the sound was great too! I highly recommend this.
4,Good for a Clancy movie,"I am a fan of Tom Clancy somewhat but it seems when his books are made into movies there is something seriously wrong with them. THFRO of course has some discrepancies with the novel but it's still an enjoyable movie IMHO. I was at one time a submariner so I know where the realism ends and fiction begins in regard to subs and the cast is great as well. If you're a fan of Clancy, military strategy, or would simply like to hear Connery do a semi-poor Russian accent then I would recommend this movie."
2,Great Movie. Average Download.,"The movie itself is awesome, but these reviews aren't about the movie but the package they come in. The digital download package is below average. While the streaming and PC download may get by, the portable video file is horrendous. You should really be given the option to decide how large the mobile file is. If your video screen is larger than 3 inches expect to be extremely disappointed.You're really better off buying the blu-ray and encoding the file yourself. PC blu-ray readers are going as low as $30, after all.Amazon's DRM system is also draconian and a huge pain. While it's probably the movie industry's fault more than Amazon's, Amazon did agree to it didn't they?In short, avoid purchasing the download versions unless you don't mind sub-average quality, 2 downloads for the PC and 2 downloads for your portable device. Just avoid it entirely so perhaps the consumers can force the industry to grow a brain and stop hurting the hands that feed them."
5,Was Curious,"When a film is mentioned in a book one particularly likes, The Elegance of the Hedgehog, one might feel curious about why this film was chosen. In this case it was the last film the couple ever attended together before the husbands death. I have some ideas now why, if I were the author, I might chose this film. The theme of drastic change in one's life being faced bravely might be one. At any rate I am enjoying watching the film."
3,GREAT MOVIE --- BAD DVD,"I really do like this movie the action , acting and story are all very strong but....I can only give the (DVD) three stars. Mind you I say DVD not the movie it`s self.This DVD has to be the worst quality I have ever seen . The sound is great but the picture really stinks( trust me folks it`s really bad) It looks like you are watching this movie though a dust storm.I have seen problems like this on older movies that have been put on DVD but come on! Paramount needs to get it in gear and improve the DVDs they are selling. A movie this great deserves better"
5,The Hunt For Red October,"I do not have the movie in question as yet. On the other hand, I did see the movie once before. I enjoyed i t very much.Thank you,John Hunter,jehunter1@charter.net"
2,Great Movie - TERRIBLE Transfer!!!,"One of THE greatest Sub movies ever filmed has received absolutely shabby treatment from it's recent transfer to DVD. Overall, the DVD menus are fine (though lacking in any sort of comprehensive background material which would be expected with a DVD that carries a label of ""Special Edition""). The audio is also fine; however, even that should have received the DTS treatment rather than just the Dolby Digital.The main crime committed against this film was the horrendous film-to-DVD transfer as it is presented. Frankly, with the sheer graininess and tendencies towards pixelization, I can't help but think that this is a VHS-to-DVD transfer. Not even a pristine VHS tape, but one that has been played daily for over 10 years! The video quality of this transfer is the worst I've seen of any movie in a very long time. Shame on the production company that made this transfer!This great movie deserved a lot better (Special Edition???) than what it got!"
5,Wow is Connery good in this one!,"Sean Connery underplays the role of the soviet sub captain exceptionally well. There is tactile suspence, adventure, and intruige in this first movie based on a Clancey story.The supporting cast is also great. It felt like the casting director had read the book.Great stuff."
2,Voivod Is Dead,"This album is proof that the great band once known as Voivod has degraded into a farce. The band that once gave us classics like ""Dimension Hatross"" and ""Nothingface"" has turned into a typical faceless metal outfit. Sure Piggys weird guitars tunings are intact as well as Aways pounding drums...but Forrest is a joke as a bassist/vocalist. A part of Voivod died when Blacky left...but the final nail in the coffin was the departure of Snake on vocals. Many people like to think of this album ( and Negatron as well ) as a return to the ""Killing Technology"" days. Not true. That album was innovative in 1987. This album sounds pretty generic. Voivod is dead"
5,The best music in the world,Beautiful haunting songs from world class performers from around the world. Perhaps the most memorable album I have ever listened to.
2,Not good for jumbo frames,"It works well as a standard gigabit ethernet switch, but if you are looking for jumbo frame support you really should look elsewhere. It works well as some other reviewers on other sites have said up to around 6k packets, after which packet loss starts to increase. Additionally you can find analysis of this switch online showing blocking after about 4.5k packets, with a performance cliff around 7k packets. This is exactly what I saw, and would cause my fairly expensive Intel e1000 NIC to reset its own port back to 100 mbps. According to what I've found online there are actually two models, so it could be this problem is only with the original model (which I purchased in 2007). Anyway, I replaced this switch with a managed gigabit dlink switch and now have no problems. Anyway, it works well if all you want is regular gigabit, but stay away if you need reliable jumbo packets."
1,Read the book and skip the movie,"To begin with, this movie supposedly based on the book is, in my opinion, garbage and not representative of the book. That being said, I am glad that I went ahead with my plan to read the book, as it has much to offer. Especially interesting to me is the historical account of the making of Key West, the Spanish War, life in China during the Japanese invasion, and World War II intrigue. All of it is conceptualized in the life of Hemingway and ""third wife"" Gellhorn, making it better, and more improbable, than fiction. The movie is embarrassing and inauthentic."
2,Bridgmans Books,"I bought 3 of Bridgmans books: Life Drawing, Constructive Anatomy and Heads, Features and Faces after reading the reviews. No one mentioned that most of the pages are dedicated to the anatomy of men, however I am interested in the female anatomy, so, these books did not work for me."
1,"HORRIBLE, VERY POOR REPRODUCTIONS","I have several Bridgman books, and I absolutely love him. I was very exited about this book, and as they say ""don't judge a book by its cover"" I did,because the cover is so nice,in fact it is the only good thing about this book, the jacket. I thought the reprint was going to be awesome, like the Dover publication books. When I got it, the reproductions are super faded, can't read the script either, I suggest getting Bridgman books from Dover publications."
1,Bad merchandise,"I discourage anyone ordering product from Cosmetic Solutions. I got a can of defective hair spray. Cosmetic Solutions would not respond to me or refund money. Luckily Amazon guarenteed my order and reimbursed me, but Cosmetic Solutions is a hoaz and rip off."
1,sandisk mp3 player,"i wish i had never bought an mp3 player/ipod-what they don't tell you is,that after the battery goes completely dead after approx.2 years ,is that you have to send the whole mp3 player back to companny so they can put new battery in it. i went to radio shack to get battery for my sandisk mp3 played,just to find out,you have to send back to company for new battery,IF I HAD KNOW THIS BEFORE I BOUGHT IT,I NEVER WOULD HAVE PURCHASED IT. read reviews before buying anything, jim"
2,Buyer Beware,"This camera is a decent general use camera, but buyers should be VERY aware of some inherent flaws with the camera and Toshiba's lack of support for their own engineering flaws. The camera has 2 reoccuring problems. First, the tabs in the battery compartment are weak. Extreme care must be taken opening and closing the compartment to prevent wear and breakage. Second, the mode dials on these cameras fall off in normal use. The plastic pins which hold it in place break off no matter how gently used. Toshiba has stopped supporting the camera with replacement parts. If the dial falls off outside the warranty window, your only option will be to trade the camera in for a refurbished camera. The price of the trade is not justifiable considering the problems, and you will be better off buying a new camera from someone besides Toshiba. I currently have a worthless PDR-M60, and will not buy from Toshiba again."
1,if there was a 0 this would have it,"i bought this because it was rechargeable and on sale.. it was larger than i thought (i was thinking a 4"" bullet from the picture; my fault for not researching better)... but that's not the problem... the problem is the base separated from the rest of the unit when i took it out of the charger the first time - it was very poorly manufactured and i will never buy this brand again"
2,"""Falls short"" of expectations","Although this may be a lovely video about fall in Vermont, I was extremely disappointed that it is only about 23 minutes long. It is advertised both on the outside of the cover and on the DVD itself with a running time of 1hr,10 minutes. Sorry, I cannot recommend this DVD due to fact it is not worth the price."
4,Unexpected wish fulfillment,"For years Angela DeSaria Malone has felt one things has been missing from her marriage, a child. The desire for the child grows so strong it destroys the marriage. Heartbroken, Angela moves back to her hometown to be enfolded in the arms of her loud, lively, Italian family. On the other side of town lives Lauren Ribido, a teenager, with a mother that cares more for her next drink than her daughter. In this book we find that life may bring our greatest wishes in a different package than we expect."
1,Build a log splitter??,"As with the other three books in the series there is useful information here, just not a whole lot of it. The attempt to cover so many bases at once causes it to fall short in all of them. Being a Monster Garage publication one might reasonably expect it focus on custom cars, but it frequently digresses with such projects as a tool caddy and bizarrely, a log splitter. Further, if there was less emphasis on the stars of the custom car industry and more on the ""how to"" this would be a much better buy. As it is, it doesn't even make the grade as a Monster Garage souvenir book as Monster Garage barely makes a mention."
1,Didn't get much out of it,"I tried to write an add-in. I got it working, but as far as getting it to really do what I wanted (something similar to NuMega DevPartner which can act on particular files in the project), this book didn't get me there. I'm not sure if the author has built any really useful add-ins either. There's certainly a market for a good book on it, but this isn't it. FWIW, I have the same author's book on programming Word, and I didn't find that any more useful than the online documentation, so perhaps this author just needs to get more into the material and then share what he learns. This book is probably too short, and perhaps the space to properly expound on the material was limited by the publisher."
2,"Good Intro, waiting for Part 2 ..... I guess.","With great excitement I purchased this book, when thumbing through it in the store it looked really promising. It truly does give alot more information than MS does, but it still leaves you confused a bit. The object models are shrugged off to very little commentary and figuring out the complexities of manipulating objects within a large program is not even touched. I had hoped that this topic had finally gotten serious consideration, it appears that this was only meant to be an intro book. I would highly recommend it if you only want to know what an add-in is, but if you want to do some serious programming with addins, you'll need alot more than this book."
4,This Is The Best Elvis Video To Date.,"The only reason I give this version four stars instead of 5 is because many of the original songs are missing. I assume at some point after the legal hassels that there will be a part two to this. I can't believe that many of the reviewers like the original version better, it contained interviews with completely unknown (not to mention strange and weird) people, the overall quality was poor and grainy, angle shots were bad and the sound sucked. Sorry guys, this new versions is by far the best!"
2,Elvis great - package poor,"If you already have the previous special edition do not buy this. The first disc duplicates exactly that release. The 2nd disc whilst having a few interesting extras is the original release. This is poor quality as compared to the first disc, and duplicates the concert again (if you already own the previous special edition).I'm afraid this is just a money making exercise to cash in on the 30th anniversary of his death."
5,5 stars is NOT enough,"This film shows, along with the '68 Comeback Special, Elvis on Tour, and Aloha From Hawaii, why Elvis was, and always will be the king. In this Elvis has the energy of a hurricane all wrapped up in one incredible man. He is lean and awesome. His voice has this great tone about it that I think sounds better than when he started out. The sound quality is so completely awesome and perfect that it sounds like it could have been recorded on today's modern equipment. The picture quality is equally as impressive. It's crystal clear, sharp, and not grainy in the least. This DVD would convert any serious music fan into an Elvis fan, and if it doesn't - they're tone deaf."
1,LOOKS LIKE CHEAP BOOTLEG,"SAVE YOUR MONEY, ORIGINAL VERSION,IN MONO,THE OUTTAKES VERY POOR PICTURE AND SOUND, THE SOUND AND FILM OF THE AFTER PARTY SEGMENT OF THE OUTTAKES ARE COMPLEAT IN THE ENDING CREDITS OF TTWII S.E.2001 RELEASE, YET WARNER CHOOSE TO CHOP UP THE SOUND UP HERE, WHAT A UNNESSARY RIP OFF."
4,special edition?,"Great video, but some people say a few songs have been removed. It is also implied by the trailer before the movie and Elvis' rehearsals (can't help believin, sweet caroline, 20 days and nights, bridge over troubled water). That's a shame if it is true to do that with a special edition. Otherwise would have given 5 stars. Elvis looks and sounds great. Just pretend gives me gooseflesh. I will buy the live album with the same name, which seems to feature the songs cut here. Can't help believin is a great track, at least I will have it on cd."
1,Turner Travesty,"This is a Turner Entertainmnet/AOL/Time/Warner film. It is NOT the MGM film. Turner has destroyed my memory of the original film. There's lots missing, nothing has been added except a (for the most part) horrible sounding soundtrack. A travesty. Stick with the old MGM VHS."
1,Elvis - That's the Way It Is (Two-Disc Special Edition),Disc No 2 - Very disappointing - Not Dolby Digital - Concert and complete disc only 1 speaker sound.Please answer if this is to be so?Regina
3,"Some good, more bad.","I just read an old Beatles interview where the Beatles themselves said when they weren't sure of a song's appeal, they would throw in a lot chords, figuring they'd dazzle the listener with the chord changes, while hiding the questionable tune itself. I had that feeling about this book, that when Amis is telling the sections of the story that are founded on a solid narrative, he writes straight and lucidly. When the narrative isn't of such sure footing, he tries to dazzle and distract the reader with oblique, recherché word play. I prefer clarity and a good story."
4,There'll Always be an England.,"Whenever I find myself getting homesick for dear old England I'll just have to refresh my memory with some Amis. The shockingly awful rags pretending to be newspapers. The random acts of violence and petty crime. The drunken, loutish behaviour that has become socially acceptable. The rampant misogamy. The ridiculous anachronism that is the Royal Family. Amis hits all the targets in YELLOW DOG. It's the UK at its worst and fiction at its best."
2,Disappointment blues.,"Another reviewer compared this to classic rock albums. This doesn't hold a candle to them. The singer can't sing, they don't write catchy lyrics, and the lyrics sounds too influenced from the singer's Entombed days. And even the album title and cover lack creativity. Check out the new Tight Bro's From Way Back When album for real rock."
3,Great songs shame about the sound quality,"The problem I find with this cd is that it does not at all sound live except for the muffled applause from the audience. Her voice sounds detached from the backing. There is no feel that this is a special ""event"" recording. As usual Lorrie's vocals are good, but the versions here all sound like she is slightly bored singing these same old songs yet again.However, the title track is a great song and Lorrie really comes to life when she starts singing songs from the great american songbook.""Good Morning Heartache"",""Fly Me to the Moon"" and ""My Favorite Things"" are all great versions of these well known songs. Fans should enjoy this cd, but new listeners may prefer one of the many greatest hits collections..... or else buy the DVD of this concert....watching and listening to Lorrie really makes it all come alive."
3,Earlier Story,"I love Stephanie Laurens but I haven't been able to do more than skim this book. It has been pointed out to me that this is a reprint and so was probably written before her wonderful Cynster series. If I had know that before I tried to read it I would have been more open to the book, since I have seen just in Stephanie Lauren's Cynster series how her writing style has improved. Don't read it if you are expecting a book like On A Wild Night or All About Love. You should be able to read it, and probably enjoy it, if you realize from the start that this is an earlier story in her writing life. Some of the other reviews I have read about this book have pointed out that there is very little talking between characters. You read most of the story in their thoughts. I agree with this and it may have been why I had difficulty reading it, since most of what I enjoy is the verbal interaction between characters."
2,Definitely not Laurens' best,"Oh, dear. So many people recommended this book, saying that they had delayed reading it because of the cheesy title, but it was wonderful. In a word, no.Sure, Laurens is the queen of the panting, highly explicit sex scene, but this book took even that to the point of ridiculousness. Not that that's too hard to do. My biggest beef with this book is that the strong, independent heroine became a total wimp every time the hero came near her. Their relationship was about sex not love; I can't see them making it as a lifetime couple. Jack always has to have the upper hand and Kit always gives in the moment he touches her.Silly.The first books in the Cynster series are Laurens' best -- you know, the ones before she starts getting repetitious."
2,Disappointing,After stumbling onto the Bar Cynster series (which has his moments but overall I love it) I was really disappointed with this book. I thought it had a very thin plot and characters and the girl disguised as a boy has been done to death. This one has gone into my recycle pile. I'm looking forward to the next Cynster book which are on my keeper shelf.
2,Poorly organized and the butterthlies is a terrible choice.,This book is definitely a poor read. I got It because I thought the second edition would be a better read. These guys need to learn how to write and organize their thoughts better. There are other books that I'll buy over this one. The trick is to make it simple and have good flow; even the choice for the website (butter*) sucks. This review comes from a guy majoring in computer science.
2,Only a synopsis of info already out there,"I could have written this book by struggling through with installing and understanding Apache myself. In fact, by installing Apache and looking through the documentation, I knew most of what was in the book already. There was no unique information here, or unique solutions to real-world problems. I think this book may save you time in an emergency or in general, but beyond that it's a bit dissappointing. I think the publisher said, ""O'K', let's get two guys, have them install Apache, and write a book about it."" That's just my opinion, though."
1,It's all uphill from here.,"Usually purchasing an O'Reilly book on any topic is a virtual guarantee of excellence. This book is a notable exception. There are many other Apache books available, I can only encourage you to take a look at them. I have worked with Apache for several years, and this book fails me every time I turn to it for help. The on line documentation is excellent and is by far the better choice. This book skips over the essentials and the basics and wanders off to discuss odd topics that have never been of concern to me. Pretty much a waste of money and shelf space. Sometimes I do say good things, go read my review of Advanced Perl Programming by Sriram Srinivasan if you don't believe this."
5,"A wonderful book, indespensabl when costuming","This book has helped me enormously when I was trying to costume many plays and events. Though the patterns in the book are not quite exact, they give so good of a beginning for costume work that they have helped so much in the detail work."
5,A basic guidebook concerning all things Catholic,"The Catholic Faith Handbook For Youth is a basic guidebook concerning all things Catholic. Intended for young adults, yet accessible to anyone who may be fuzzy on the details of Catholicism, The Catholic Faith Handbook For Youth covers creed, sacraments, morality, and prayer, along with articles concerning information on current events from a Catholic point of view, advice for prayer, profiles of thirty-seven Catholic saints, notes on the history of the Catholic Church, and more. Full-color illustrations pepper this highly readible introduction to a spiritual way of life. Especially recommended reading to share with one's preteen and teenage children in order to teach them more about Catholicism and what it means to live one's life by Catholic religious principles."
5,Very Motivating,"In reading this book, I have become more responsible and self assured. The exercises that Tessina has included in this book are just wonderful. I kept a pencil handy while I was reading the book and there notes everywhere! I go back through those notes from time to time to refresh myself. I have since lent my copy to several friends. I am sure it will help them too. I highly recommend this book to young women! Also, even though it is geared towards women, the ideas can apply for men also."
2,Hated it and I'm returning it,Very poor explanation of Accessing Databases with FrontPage. The examples were vague and didn't work. Jim Buyens may know his subject but he sure doesn't know how to present it in understandable terms. He and Laurie Lemay should be banned from publishing technical documentation.
4,USEFUL BUT A BIT TOO ELABORATE,"The book was a good book. Let's get that straight. It provided in-depth info on almost everything imaginable. Herein was a bit of a problem, however, because he did a little too much describing. For example, Chapter 4 is all about colors. Instead of just sticking to explaining how FrontPage handles colors, he goes off explaining Hexadecimal, CMY, RGB, and the scientific view of light and color. He also gets into screen brightness in that chapter.Overall I say it's a good buy, but you might get a little bored reading some parts."
1,rating Of 1 Not For Bobby Rydell But For This CD.,"This cd is a remake by Bobby of his songs,For years Cameo Parkway held the masters so artists like Bobby and Chubby Checker rerecorded there records how they did this leagally i do not know,but there is no reason to buy this collection when you can buy the Cameo Parkway Collection for a decent price and have all the original master recordings,and Chubbys is out there to.....Bobby is a class act though even to this day if you never knew this story,when Bobby was young his parents would take him to Wildwood,NJ. and he would be singing in the back seat.Bobbys father would ask him to please shut up and stop singing,and said your not a singer,but low and behold Bobby did become a singer and even sang about his Wildwood days.Wildwood NJ is certainly not the same town as the time Bobby sang about it but listening to this song you can relive those days just a little."
1,inaccurate and all tell no show,"As one guy said the book is all tell no show. Allot of inaccuracies abound throughout and I'm a kernel hacker. Get Sobel's book. Also there is allot of things who would use, like ELM? Get real and pass this loser by."
1,Cable Car Confidential,"Being a native of this area, I have ridden the cable cars many, many times.There is absolutly nothing outrageous about this book. It is not interesting nor funny. Most all stories most people would not bat an eye at. Overall = Boring. Recomendation = Don't waste your time. Honestly !!"
1,Misleading!,"I thought I was getting the whole set of palette knives, instead I got only ONE knife. They completely tricked me! I'm boiling. I would never have paid for one knife. I don't know if I would buy from Painting-Crafts agiain. The description and picture is compleately misleading. And the knife is flimsy."
2,This book is way out of date book.,"I'm taking my first Cisco class this summer (fundamentals of networking). Last week, I read this book to try to understand what my Cisco option might be. This gives an overview of the Cisco track exams, which have changed since 1999. It left me more confused after reading the book. This book does do a wonderful job covering advice on studying, job hunting, and testing. The book should be updated."
4,Helpful,"This book has a lot of Oracle tuning tips and advise about some certain plattforms and technologies. Although there's a lot of considerable information about almost anything related with Oracle tuning (including OPS), it doesn't provide with a concise method or guide.The book is structured to help you at different stages of your Oracle implementation (design phase, production, proactive and reactive tuning, capacity planning, etc). But that good schema looks very confuse when the author starts to make suggestions or tips that aren't sorted by any kind of category (and they often takes a lot of pages)... Those comments are very good, so it needs a bit of more organization.I recommend this book for instance and database tuning, but not for SQL tuning (the author has another excellent book on this subject). There aren't too many advices regarding the plattform (unix or nt), so, keep in mind you'll need more support."
5,"A little out of date, a few typos, but the best you can get","I have been using a copy of this book for a couple of years now, and I have still kept it as my 'good tricks' bible since becoming being a certified Oracle dba. Ok, so not all the queries run first time as given, and the book is really about Oracle 7, but this is still the first reference book I turn to whenever another dba comes up with a 'I've tried everything to do this, but nothing works' type question. A very good book to read if you want to know how to make Oracle work for you."
5,Something for everyone.,"This book was recommended by a friend but, when I started reading it, I thought they were pulling my leg. It was too easy to read and understand to be a real Oracle reference manual, wan't it? Now it is my main reference for all Oracle Performance tuning and debugging problems. Invaluable."
1,"1 marker, not 12.","The description says you get 12 pens, but you only get one. Yes [...] is a fair price to pay for 1 pen, but if I had known it was only one I certainly would not have paid [...] for them to mail me one pen! Sounds a little too much like a scam to me. The seller was good enough to refund my money after I contacted them, so if you have bought this pen thinking you would get 12, definately contact them and demand a refund. They certainly aren't in any hurry to correct the description as it has been over a month since I bought it and it still says 12 pens.Regarding the pen itself, it is far from perfect. It will occasionally spurt out a large amount of paint onto your work with no warning, making a mess of everything, including your clothes. Other than that, the colors are good and when it doesn't squirt it works pretty good."
5,Great book on SQL Server logic,"This book has been specifically written for database administrators, designers or programmers who want to know more about logic behind SQL2000 GUI. This book also can be a significant step to understand T-SQL and database design and implementations. In particular for someone preparing for the MS certification exam on SQL7 or 2000 DB implementation, this book should be the first to start. After reading this book you should be well advanced in using not only proper T-SQL syntax but also understand execution plans in Query Analyzer. This book can give you a fresh view to understand how to design and write to get optimum from SQL Server. Final words in my review: this book is rather not for beginners but can give you info on SQL real world challenges."
3,Good but predictable.,"The movie was good mainly because of th acting and the action packed last half hour. However, the initial 30 minutes are very boring and there is nothing of interest. Things pick up though and Glenn Cl.ose comes off as truly deranged--the cutting of legs. However, I can 8understand her anger and she really is quite explosive during the final sequence. Michael douglas was his usual boring self and I didn't like the way he was so unffeling to Close and the baby. Anne Archer was excelllent and we could feel her concern and fear throughout the last half hour. Good film, but not great."
4,You never really know someone,"This is one of the greatest depictions of a woman gone totally f_____g off the deep end I've ever seen. Which brings me to my point: some women you can get with, use each other and be done with it. And there are those whose diabolical intentions do not come to the fore until it is too late. Lucky for me, I got out of such a situation with minor scrapes a long time ago. This is a great film along the lines of the '78 documentary ""Scared Straight"". As far as the question of choosing between the lovely Anne Archer vs. the ugly Glenn Close...sometimes these things don't matter as much when enough erotic HEAT is being thrown your way. That explains that."
4,KICK TO THE GUT,"Adrian Lyne had every adulterous married man in the world shaking in his boots with this slick, terrifying portrait of one such ill-considered affair. Glenn Close broke her long tradition of saintlike roles with her viciously effective Alex, the woman you do not ignore. Michael Douglas is perfectly cast as the husband, and Anne Archer provides an emotional warmth that makes the deception even more potent. Though the movie flashes with a bit of dated style -- tilted cameras; shocking slams and bangs; a bit too much gloss over all -- it nevertheless gets you right in the gut; the experience is visceral. I am not enthralled with the ending, because it seems over the top and from another movie, which makes sense --the ending is actually a re-considered finale; test audiences wanted revenge, and wanted it complete and with venom. They got what they asked for."
1,Rabbit stew anyone?,"Sorry, but I don't get off on boiled pets and slashed wrists. I found the scene with the boiling pet rabbit extremely distasteful. I avoid this film like the plague."
5,No he didn't!,"I can't believe that fool Robert Smith done told Wendy Williams that he and Brandy never married! I was too hot when I heard that. How DARE he insult Brandy like that? Now, she's out in hiding in LA and won't talk to the press no more. But this single is tight! Miss Girl really works it OUT in this single. You won't get enuff of it. Brandy, do your thing and don't worry about that IDIOT Robert Smith."
2,Rushed and incomplete,"After reading this book, I was very disappointed. The author seemed hurried and the book felt incomplete. While I think the aspirations of this book were high, I have to question the usefulness of the content of this book."
3,Great historical detail,"Very interesting book but a little hard going with all the Battle of Waterloo detail, which was certainly thorough and I learned a lot more than I previously knew"
2,Simplistic but True,"This book is simplistic in its approach, but it illustrates very well our society's tendency to overcomplicate processes to the point the original objective becomes almost unattainable."
2,Too little useful information,"This book's strong point is that it covers a very large amount of information on java programming. This, however, is also it's weak point. It doesn't cover anything in any useful amount. I think if it covered half the subject matter, and went into depth on the subjects it did cover, this book would be a must have. I'd skip it unless you just wanted to see what java was capable of. It provides a good survey of java topics. I'd buy books on the subject you were interested in, and skip this one. I returned mine."
3,"Broad, but very shallow coverage of new Java features","Maybe only 20% of this heavy book contains useful information. It mentions almost every feature of Java, but that's the problem -- it ONLY mentions most of them. It is helpful with the Java 1.2 Swing library, since many older books do not cover that much at all.I've referred to it for information I cannot find in other books, but it does not provide a full explanation, and I end up looking elsewhere for a more complete understanding."
2,1300 pages of inconsequential code,A real disappointment (as are most books on this subject). The authors were obviously getting paid by the page. After developing a front end application using 1.2 and swing -- I not once found any useful information here. Better look at another title.
4,Their Last Experimental Album,"This is their last full burst of creativity before they lost the talented Mr Kath and before they started becoming an AOR band. Compositions are spread out over more band members and this CD has jazz influences. Also, four major Chicago songs on here."
1,Mummer falls flat,Skip this one. Get Waxworks or another XTC Greatest Hits compilation and you'll have everything of note on the album.
2,Not the best,Let me suggest alternatives for the fan who doesn't have everything yet and who likes the more rockin' XTC (as opposed to the more melodic and orchestral stuff):1)Skylarking2)English Settlement3)Drums and Wires4)Dukes of Stratosphere (chips)5)Black Sea6)Oranges and Lemons
4,XTC Becomes Reflective,"XTC's first record after announcing they will no longer tour. Insightful and reflective best describes ""Mummer"". ""Love on A Farmboy's Wages"" is a touching lament, while ""In Loving Memory Of A Name"" is a sincere ode to those who died for their country. A nice breather following the fierce intensity of ""English Settlement"" and what was to follow next: The locomotive titled ""The Big Express""."
2,Maddeningly Hobbyhorsical,"Imagine a book filled with em dashes separated by the occasional non sequitur. There you have TS, a jumble of a hodgepodge of a melange. Occasionally delightful turns of phrase notwithstanding, TS is recommended only to bookish masochists interested in dogs of the shaggy persuasion. (Sterne's Sentimental Journey, on the other hand, is a masterpiece.)"
1,Only For Students of Stream of Consciousness,"This was the 4th book I had to read for History of the Novel. It was so bad (in my opinion) it nearly drove me crazy! This novel lacks ANY orginization or memorable features. (Thank goodness the teacher did not ask us to do a paper on it!) I understand that the author was introducing a new technique (stream of consciousness). But if you want to read a good example of stream of consciousness you should move towards Virginia Woolf's ""To the Lighthouse."" Also Margaret Laurence's ""The Stone Angel."" The only good thing I can possibly say about ""Tristram Shandy"" is that it may be a golden turkey. (That is a novel that is SO BAD it actually takes on a charm of its own.)"
4,"Great band, no reason to buy the import though","This is an amazing band and one of my favorite CDs ever written. All of the musicians are able to convey exactly what they are feeling through their instruments from the drums in back straight through to the vocals in front.Buy this cd... but don't buy the import unless you are a collector. No extra tracks. The music video for The Year Summer Ended In June is included on the cd but at a very low quality, not much better than you'd get on youtube for free."
2,Ehh...,"Im a huge fan of The Offspring but the cd just didnt do it for me. I loved their last 6 but this one is just... different. The lyrics are weird and the style is different. Im not saying that you will not like this CD but if you liked the other 6 you wont necessarilly enjoy this one. All in all, if you are a dedicated fan then you should still own this CD."
4,A solid debut from a great band,"The Offspring's self-titled debut...so long ago it's really mind-blowing, quite remarkable that these guys are still around and still making awesome music. Of their 7 albums, this is the least polished, least poppy, and least popular, but its raw punk energy, poetic lyrics, and catchy songwriting make up for all that. 1989 Offspring is far, far different from 2005 Offspring. Both sides of the band are very good, though. Their self-titled debut shows a more free-spirited, political, and punk-influenced band. The songs are darker in tone and subject matter, but have the same frenzied energy, skillful vocals, and kick-ass guitars that have defined The Offspring's long career. The production is not as squeaky-clean as on the band's recent albums, but this only adds to the album's charm. Pretty much every song on here is solid and memorable. Overall, a worthy and enojyable debut from a consistently excellent band."
2,Great CD... Until You Hear Dexter's Singing,"I am a proud owner of every offspring album to date and i dont regret buying any of them. some people say, oh the offspring were so good when they started and now they're just pop punk and mtv style. of course most of you are saying it to sound cool. this does not reflect my idea. instead of reviewing it, i will give you diary entries of the first time i heard the cd.4:08 pm: i put the cd into my cd player and i listen to jennifer lost the war. then i realize that dexter sounds like he's dying.4:10 pm: jennifer lost the war ends and i listen to elders hoping that it will be better. it was much better. instead of dying, dexter was just wailing.4:10-the end of the cd: i only listened to the guitar, the almost inaudible bass, and the drums. that made the cd sound a lot better.IF YOU WANT AN OFFSPRING CD, DONT BUY THIS ONE UNLESS YOU COLLECT THEM LIKE ME. I RECOMMEND ANYTHING AFTER IT PREFERABLY SMASH, AMERICANA, AND CONSPIRACY OF ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,One song ruined it,"First off, I would like to let everyone know that I'm a die-hard fan of The Offspring. When I bought this cd, i got exactly what i expected, some old punk rock with hard to hear lyrics. It was really great until I read the lyrics to Beheaded, number six on the cd. It was a really gross song talking about a madman going around chopping people's heads off. It made me sick. I wouldn't recommend this cd just because of this song."
4,Good book for a new developer,"I've been trying to make the jump from hotshot user to developer since my job has me developing applications for other users, and I've tried a couple of Access books that just didn't cover all the bases for turning a fairly advanced user into a developer. I liked this one because I thought it did an understandable job of doing this."
4,christmas cheer,This was a really seasonal book that helped me get into the holiday spirit. It was an emotional roller coaster that had me anxious to see what would happen next. Each story had a happy ending that made it worth reading. I would buy it again and I hope to see more like it soon.
5,Must Have,"This album is amazing and I can't stop listening to it. I first found out about them by some link referring to them in the lines of Siouxsie....and well, anything related to Siouxsie I will probably like. I saw their video for ""The 1234"" and loved their sound. First two albums were OK....then this one came out and floored me. I got to see them live for the first time last night in NYC and was even more stunned with their sound live....and Aimee is a extremely engaging peformer. Check them out."
1,Zero Star if I had the choice,Bad Bad Bad.. stay away. I got a 25 pack and only 3 worked the rest either couldn't be used the second burn or burn fail right out of the box.
2,Every Time I Buy...,"I was looking forward to this, especially since they blew me away when they played with Scarlet, Black Dahlia Murder and As I Lay Dying.I loved Hot Damn! because it was pretty much a party album that you could go crazy and break stuff to. This album seems to try to, but ends up sounding pretty bland.Its not that it isnt heavy, because it sure is. Its just that the heaviness doesnt really do anything for it. I tried listening to this album about 3 times, and on the third i just stopped it after the third track. I dont know how they managed to make this album so plain and boring, but they did.Oh yeah, if i wasnt told about the guest appearances on the cd, i wouldnt even have noticed they were there. If you were going to check out the album based on that fact, dont even bother. Stick with the previous album, this one is a real snoozefest."
1,I wanted to die every time I heard this sh@#!,"Ive tried to get into this band and it just never happened. Theres so much hype around them and no follow through for me at least. This album is anything but good. I wanted to shoot everyone involved in making this record after the first 2 songs. I cant stand that whining! Totally sucked! Dont get pulled into this band. They f#$kin suck. They even look like a bunch of fairies. They probly do each others hair and nails before each show, naked and covered in crisco or somethin"
3,Japan versis China in martial arts,"The Shanghai international community is the scene of this Japaneseconspiracy against a Chinese kung fu school.First the founding teacher is poisoned by the Japanesecooks, then the school is openly attacked by a Japaneseschool. The hero kills many in individual combatin his revenge. The story of his love for his Chinese girland his eventual end are an action packed martial artstreat showing Bruce Lee's style of Kung Fu."
1,Just poorly written,"I thought this book would be up to the usual O'Reilly standards. I was wrong. Don't bother.UML In a Nutshell should be about half its current size. It's full of verbiage that doesn't really add anything. The book should ""cut to the chase"" and get stuff accomplished up-front, rather than wax philosophical in bureaucratese for the first three chapters.Bits like ""The problem occurs within a business context (domain or space). The solution must be realized to fit within the organization's information technology infrastructure (domain or space)."" [p16] should be taken out and shot with the bullets from the neighboring pages. I mean really, who cares (domain or space)?You can open this book at random and find pretty much the same kind of writing.Sorry. At least it wasn't that expensive (domain or space)."
2,Not an introduction,"This book is a very difficult read and not for novices. I bought it when I needed to understand UML for the first time and I am afraid that it failed my expectations. In the end I forced myself to speed read through the whole thing just to get some kind of overview. I suspect some of it penetrated my subconscious, but not a great deal, since a large portion of the book is bulleted with incomplete sentences. I now use it as it was intended to be used, as a reference guide, for which the book partially succeeds. Even so, I have not found a single UML book that is both informative and exciting. They are usually one or the other."
2,"Unlike most O'Reilly books, it's poorly written","As a devotee of O'reilly titles (it's the first publisher I usually look to on computer subjects), this one was disappointing. Regardless of whether it covers the subject matter well, the book fails simply because of the writing. It is, at least in the beginning, weighed down by comma series that go on forever, parenthetic notes that are redundant, and points that are lost in a volume of unrelated stuff.The author lacks focus, and the writing style is academic. This is not a practitioner's guide. I ended up purchasing a second UML book within a week."
3,latin Stars can do better,"Lissette has many more great hits. The selection of these songs by Sony was weak....you should know better. Next time you want to put Lissette's hits together in an C.D. please contact me. However, this Latin Stars C.D. clearly shows the talented artist that Lissette is."
1,Worthless!,"The contents of this book should be focused on the functions and wiz-bang attributes of Painter -- you'd think. Instead, we are made to sit through the endless harangue of Rhoda Grossman (a name Dickens would have approved of!). Sherry London's opinions aren't as blatant, but when have you ever had to endure a bashing to find out how to use a product? Painter is an incredible product. Thank goodness I already know this or I might feel embarrassed about my choice, based on the commentary in this book. The book is a total waste of money. It gets one star only because zero isn't allowed."
2,Not a fan,I was not a fan of this book. When I received the book I realized I had purchased it several years ago and gave it away. I would like to see more concrete skills. I am not a fan of worksheets or drawings. I would have like to have more scenerios that one could role play with students.
2,"Predictable, but engaging","This book could be the script for an Aaron Spelling Western Soap Opera. Grey's women characters are supposed to be strong, but their beliefs never seem to match their actions. His research on Mormons (if he did any) must have come from a really disgruntled former member of the religion. Taken for what it is, a romantic old western, it's good entertainment. You'll roll your eyes, but you'll keep reading."
2,slow,"This book is slow, I made it through it but probably will never read it again. Characters do stupid things and could of eliminated a lot of grief with a different choice."
2,Hard to finish,"The dialog in the book is old, so it's distracting, and not a quick read, because of it. I read the entire book (book club selection), but I had to force myself to complete it. I didn't think there was much depth at all to the characters until the latter parts of the story, and Jane Withersteen seems far too whiney for my tastes."
3,Thought I Was Getting a Classic Western,"I picked up this book thinking I was going to get a classic spaghetti western: a gun-slinging rapid-firing rapid-reading book. Instead I got a soap opera set in Utah with purple prose tiringly describing purple sage, cliffs and rock formations. There is an astounding lack of action. Not being familiar with genre, maybe my expectations were off, but I shant be coming back to Zane Grey soon."
5,Fun and easy puzzle for a toddler,"My kids adore all of their Melissa and Doug puzzles and we love that they are challenging, yet easy to use. Tip: make sure to put all the pieces back in after each use. Every night when we turn out the lights we have a virtual concert of barks and monkey noises, but it is fun. We tell the animals good night after we identify the sounds with the kids."
3,Scary puzzle when the lights go out,"The puzzle is actually pretty nice, although the animal sounds a bit tinny and the top layer of the puzzle doesn't stand up well to slobbery mouthes. The reason I gave the puzzle only 3 stars is that it's really creepy when you turn out the lights and it makes the sound of whatever animal is missing (the zebra will make the hair on the back of your neck stand up on a quiet night)."
4,For an autistic child,"I bought these for my Autistic nephew when he was 2 on the recommendation of an Occupational Therapist. Having no children of my own, I am not familiar with the different brands for children's toys. After asking around I was told that Melissa and Doug were well known for their safety and quality so I decided to go ahead even though $10 for a puzzle seemed high to me.My nephew loves these. In addition to hearing the sounds and learning to mimic them, he is also learning tactile skills which is what his therapist has been focusing on. I like the quality of the puzzles. They are very well made and remind me of toys I had when I was a kid, when you could actually keep toys to pass on, not the disposable toys there are now.As a special bonus, the sounds are perfect to get on my brothers nerves, hehehe. We are 13 years apart and I love teasing him about getting back at him now for his toddler days![...]"
3,It needs an on/off switch!,"The toy has realistic animal sounds, but the sounds will go off at random all day (and night!) long. It really needs an on/off switch. It's great for the educational value, but the fact that the sounds can go off at any time can be really annoying (and startling at times!) If you decide to get one, just make sure it's never in a bedroom or a place where people may be sleeping!"
3,New York puzzle,Was fun to do. Not a huge challenge but a welcome reprieve from those monstrous 2000 piece monotone puzzles.
1,Doesn't work,"Mine wouldn't work from the first moment I opened it. It won't even power on. Could be a bad battery, but this is terrible quality control."
1,Didn't dig this one at all,"I've been a fan of George Carlin for quite a while, so I was looking forward to seeing this DVD. But after the first few minutes, I turned it off - because it turned *me* off. I don't mind ""the 7 words you can't say"" in a comedy sketch, but being vulgar right off the bat - nope (what I call ""jr. high humor for boys).George Carlin is very intelligent and can be really funny - check out some of his other work."
3,review,"This was a lot smaller than the picture depicted. Because of the view, I was expecting more than one item in the box."
2,"If you work during the day, pick a different book","I just recently got a Puggle and wanted some advice on house training. The author was very rude about owners who work. I am out of the house most of the day at work. The author believes that if you are out of the house for the entire day then you should just get a cat. Apparently working ""Mom's"" don't have the right to have a dog. I didn't even read past that part and I wish I could have returned the book. Most people don't have the luxury of staying home all day. The author should recognize that rescuing a dog and having it in a nice cage with toys and a fluffy blanket is better than sitting in a cold, empty, cement cage at the pound. I suggest picking a different book where the author is not as judgmental."
4,Great book,My girlfriend and I have only read the first few chapters and already learned a lot from the book. I believe some of what the author explains is redundant.
4,Good for a travel set,I bought this set for my husband who does a lot of business traveling. He has been very pleased with it. I would recommend it for travel as well as home.
3,Average at best,"Mediocre acting abounds in this made for TV movie featuring mostly TV actors on hiatus. An older woman (Rue McClanahan) on the verge of marrying a much younger man (Patrick Duffy) must deal with the effect her upcoming marriage has on her grown offspring, who gather for the nuptials and each bring their own bag of problems - including a nun thinking about leaving the convent (Kristy MacNichol), a single father who wants the best for his girls (Conor O'Farrell), and a daughter who never blinks (Anne Bobby). The other son is a throw away character who is portrayed by a different actor in each sequel (which interesting enough feature Duffy's TV brother Ted Shackleford - Gary Ewing from ""Knots Landing"" portraying the character Duffy originated).The over-acting is unintentionally funny. Definitely check this one out on Lifetime Movie Network; even at $6 it's not worth the price."
5,This is a banquet not to be missed,"This book is almost just as funny as one of Rosalind Russell's movies. I learned much I hadn't known before about her early life, as well as her co-stars. The book gives hilarious insights into such projects as His Girl Friday (1940), and The Women (1939), her first comedy.Roz, the fast-talking dame, will never disappoint in this three-laughs-a-page book. It's also got some great photographs, of her childhood, early acting career, and behind-the-scenes shots of her films. If you are a fan of Rosalind Russell, missing out on this book is your loss!"
5,I love this book!,"I could (and have) read this book over and over. Rosalind Russell takes you through her life as a child in Conneticut, her career with MGM, and her marriage to Freddie Brisson. I found each story engrossing, none of it was disinteresting. She tells the story of her life as if she was speaking to you personally. This book is a must read for any Rosalind Russell fan."
4,What a Fantasy!,"Sebastian has a great, vivid imagination I wish we all had. It's a movie that will never get old."
4,Wow!,"I really enjoy this movie, but what I am starting to realize know is the extraordinary symbolism of this movie.The Barret Oliver character literally escapes into the book and you see his adventures of the indian boys quest to stop ""The Nothing."" The Nothing is an excellent enemy: formless, unstopable, it's only goal is to destroy whatever is in it's path. It represents the gradual disentegration of imagination and fantasy. But within this world there is still hope represented by the princess, Falcor, and the characters scattered throught the film.Amazing work by Wolfgang Petersen and his crew. It blew me away to find out he had directed this movie considering I had known him as the director of some of the best and most intelligent action films I've seen: Das Boot, Air Force One, In the Line of Fire. He did this incredible job of making the film appeal to kids and adults at the same time without being, well, sappy!:)"
5,great blu-ray! buy it!,This movie was obviously restored before the transfer to blu-ray. Picture quality is really good considering how old this movie is. very pleased.
3,Happy with the purchase,"A fabulous movie, one of my favorites, though I agree with the transfer criticisms in other reviews."
5,This movie takes you to a fantasy land,"The first time I saw this movie, I was sitting my 4th grade classroom. I'm now 28 and this is still one of my favorite movies. This is a story about a boy (Bastien) who loves to read and finds a book that takes his imagination a bit far -- he finds the book ""The Neverending Story,"" which is about the crumbling of the fantasy land, Fantasia. The princess calls for a great warrior to stop The Nothing, which is destroying their land, Fantasia. Atreju (pronounced a-tray-you) arrives at the castle and accepts his mission. The quest to fight The Nothing proves tedious, but he meets some interesting characters along the way who end up helping him in one way or another (even if he doesn't know it). At the risk of spoiling the movie, I won't go into more details, but this is DEFINITELY a must-watch for anyone who enjoys fantasy."
5,SO necessary for your child's imagination,"i adored this movie when i was growing up. i must have watched it hundreds of times as a child, and to this day, it still touches me. any parent of a child now who does not expose his/her child to this film, is really doing that child an injustice. this movie is heart, soul, adventure and more."
5,IT'S THE BEST EVER!!,"I am was born in 1983, and when I was growing up I happened to notice this very thrilling movie that my older sister was watching. I thought nothing of it, till now. Awhile ago, I pulled it off of my video shelf, and I was in "" Awe "" after I was done. I fell in love with it. It has a GREAT choice of people to play the characters. My favorite, is Noah Hathaway. I totally fell head over heals for him in the movie! This movie, has a great moral to it, and really made me stop and think. This is a MUST SEE MOVIE of all times! This movie will make you want to see it over and OVER! ( That's so true, because I have seen it a total of 9 times in 3 days!!)"
4,"Great movie, though the book's much better.","This movie is a great film from the 80's. I enjoyed the fantasy-like, imaginative plot of the movie and the characters. Though it might make you laugh for all the wrong reasons, (poor acting, ancient special effects, etc.) it is a sweet movie that has that special touch to it. To newer audiences, it may be a bit boring, old, and stale. As with a lot of movies based on books, it doesn't have all the thrill in comparison to the book in my opinion. It is a classic. Even if you hate it you should watch it (sort of like how don't like certain subjects in school, but learn about them anyway,) because it's a cultural icon."
5,The Story for Every Child Who Dreams,"Well, I first rented this movie as a boy--and boy did I ever love it! That was back in the early 1990s, when VHS was all there was. Hey, we all thought cassette tapes were great when that's all we had; audio tapes were also plentiful.This movie makes the ultimate example of getting caught up in an experience. Based on a children's fantasy by the German author Michael Ende, it is about a boy reading a book and then journeying inside that book to live in a real parallel universe. Fantasia is being destroyed by humanity's lack of imagination. To get home the boy must find a magical princess and give her a new name, thus restoring the status quo.Filled with fun and adventure--and a moral for you parents, that is to never let your imaginations atrophy.Enjoy, dream big, and dream on!"
5,Awesome Movie! : ),This movie is my all time favorite movie. The visual effects are incredible. Full of colour and imagination. I recommend it for all the children of the world. ; )
1,"TERRIBLE job, Warner Home Video!!","BOOOOOOOOOO....How bout the studio actually get's the director involved w/ this blu-ray release instead of just releasing a bare-bones one? Apparently Wolfgang Petersen wasn't even acknowledged of the blu-ray release, which he says he would've loved to have been involved with, see article: [...]Not even worth $5, let me know when a worthy version with some involved extras hits shelves."
1,"Love The Movie, Hate The Shipper","I've seen this movie before, so I knew what I was getting. What I don't know is how the movie can be shipped and take 17 days to reach you. SmokeyMountainBooks shipped it quickly, but it took over 2 weeks to reach me. That makes no sense to me. I thought 3-5 buisness days was pretty standard. I will never use them again."
1,The worst of the four.,"National Lampoon's European Vacation is just plain horrible. I hate this one more than Vegas Vacation, Vacation and Christmas Vacation are the most funny and original. I am surprised this second film of the franchise is directed by Amy Heckerling, all of her other films are brilliant. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo reprise their roles and even though all the Rusty's and Audrey's are different actors, these two airheads are so untalented, where did they get these two kids from? Stay away from European Vacation, it's a piece of trash."
1,Been there done that!!,"I was in this film and I think it's pants. Rusty's dream sequence on the plane to London where he is in a ""nightclub"" surround by punks - that's me - 2nd punk on the left with a large red and black mohican, if you freeze frame you can actually see me!! Except for that split second there is nothing of merit in this dreadful sequel to a quite funny original. Rusty you just want to slap and Audrey you just want to drown.Truely awful."
4,Chevy Chase,"It's not as good as the first Vacation, but if you like Chevy Chase, you won't be disappointed. It is typical situations for Chevy. You will see it coming, but you will laugh anyway."
3,Chevy Chase is on another Vacation-UH-OH,"The griswolds are on another fun old fashioned vacations to Europe. I gave this movie 3 stars because it wasn't as funnie as Christmas Vacation(the funniest of them all)but not as bad as Vegas Vacation. There were a few funny parts like when chevy chase is looking for realitives in house nuber 6. He can't find it, so he goes and asks a neighbor, but thinks six is sex in Europe. He knocks and asks to a man ""Hi, i'm looking for sex."" The man replies""pirvirt and slams the door in his face"". This movie is great, but no one under 9 or 10 should see it."
3,Not As Good As I Was Expecting...,After the origional movie I would have thought this would have been much much funnier. I'm not saying that this movie doesn't have it's hilarious moments (think the German dance scene and the driving scenes) but there are several moments where you know you're expected to laugh but it's just not funny (think the game show host part and the countless show of breasts)...However there is still the zany charm of National Lampoon. However if you haven't seen any National Lampoons don't start with this one.
2,"Hold Your Nose! Smells, stinks, reeks of mildew and mold...","Bought a Duet set a year ago. I have no gripe with the washing itself and the clothes themselves miraculously smell OK when they're done, but the interior of the machine smells dangerously bad and is getting worse. According to epinion.com reviews, this seems like a common problem.Some online chats suggest trying 2-3 cups of bleach on the sanitation cycle and then to leave the door open between washes. I'll try the bleach, but the open door idea won't work - I have cats. What a pain in the neck ... and nose!!! I would never buy another."
5,helpful book for speakers and writers,arranged by topics; easy to look up; small size is handy; but would prefer a larger size book with larger print
1,"Poor coverage of CGI, regex, modules and packages etc...","After reading Learning Perl on Win32 Systems, I'm totally convinced that the sole purpose of this book is to promote ""Learning Perl"" and ""Programming Perl"" from the -suprisingly- same author. You'd do alot better if you purchase ""Learning Perl"" and ""Programming Perl"" straight up from the beginning, subscribe to wellknown mailing list ""perl-win32-users"" instead of buying this book."
3,For Twice the Price Go Buy The CD With All 6 Books,"Go search for it on Amazon- ""The Perl CD Bookshelf"""
4,Kept for the Master's Use,"This was a wonderful book to read for someone, who is trying to be used for the Lord! I would recommend it highly.Sandy Woodruff"
4,A quick read but loads of insight,"This is a very small book relative to other business books, but it does make quite an impact. I was very impressed with the quality of information, and how the author really brings his entrepreneurial experience alive.I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I would have liked a little more substance."
4,Has worked for me for many many years,"I can't say anything bad about this product other than after many years of using it (must be between 5 and 10 years) it has worked pretty solidly. I don't do crazy cuts, but trim my hair, beard or chest every so often. It has done the job and without fail until this year. Something wrong with the plug connecting to the machine or something mechanical on the inside. So I am looking to buy the same one and I hope it will last for another decade. I will come back to review it then if it fails for some reason."
1,Self Indulgence - The Blanchard Way....,"I read this book and while I thought it was interesting during the first few chapters, it quickly turns into a self indulgent tale of ""look how much money we spent and all that we went through to live in Paradise"".Are these people for real? Seems to me that the book was written to recoup their initial start-up expenses. Been to their little restaurant in Paradise and the food is about as good as the book. In fact, I gave them one star for their food and book combined."
5,A Mind Trip to the Beach,"Reading this book was like taking a trip to Anguilla in my mind, each sitting bringing lovely images of the sun, beach, food, local life. On the same level as Under the Tuscan Sun or the Provence books (complete with recipes scattered throughout), this book is a great account of the experiences of a foreigner adapting to a new culture/setting. Those who have travelled to the Caribbean will surely laugh out loud at some of the more typical experiences (both good and bad) that the Blanchards have in moving to and opening their restaurant. Ultimately, the story is a love letter to the island of Anguilla and its residents. I hope to travel there soon and dine at Blanchard's too!"
3,"Moderate reading, at times monotonous","Overall well written with a very good description of island life. The reader does get drawn in and gets transported to the islands. Interesting characters and uselful recipes! However, I did find that at times I was bored and had to stop and take a break from reading (not good), even tough I am a big fan of the Caribbean and its lifestyle. But then again, look at all the other positive reviews...So make you choice..."
5,Read book on the way home from Anguilla,"...I bought the Blancards' book at their restaurant after eating dinner there. I was absolutely mesmerized by the Blancards' hospitality in their restaurant. Melinda's writing equals her culinary experise. We love Anguilla, and their book gives a marvellous portrait of life there. Only one humongous problem...how can we keep this Caribbean paradise from becoming another Aspen? Books like this one, won't help. Already the ""glitzeratti"" have found the place. Keep this island paradise small, obscure and very difficult to get to...it took us all day and three planes to accomplish this. Love the place; love the book; love the Blanchard's."
4,What an interesting journey!,"I don't often read biographies or personal stories like this one, but this really resonated with me. We've been thinking of moving to Costa Rica, and this was an amazingly similar story. Melinda Blanchard really makes you feel like you're there with them, making each decision, facing each problem, making new friends. At the end, you say ""Wow!"".Now I'm going to get the cookbook too..."
5,A great read aloud book!,"I got this book from our library 3 months ago and have renewed it four times in a row! My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves it and I have to say I enjoy reading it to her. It has wonderful rhymes, rhythm and review (like the house that jack built) so it is lots of fun! I have my daughter guess the next word because the rhyming is generally predictable, it also teaches a little about colors and is just plain silly which makes it fun for all. At last I am buying my own copy so someone else can get it from the library!"
3,cute but not great,"Cute story but not one of our favorites. Positives:nice rhyming text, repetitive verse so your kids can join in from memory, into to colors. Negatives: not a big fan of the artwork. It's not bad, just not great."
3,"good, but","I bought it for just one track, Superbird, the track is fantastic the rest is out of date now"
3,works well for a small space,It looks cheesier in the picture than when you actually hang it up. One of the three bulbs didn't work so I had to replace that. Not a bad mini chandelier for the money. I would only hardwire this in the ceiling--otherwise hanging the chain down a wall doesn't look as cute. Just saying.
2,Meh.....,"Shipping was fast and packaging was good. However, I wasn't impressed with the product. The beds are scuffed up and as soon as I plugged it in, a light bulb blew. It's smaller than I was thinking it was gonna be. Just disappointed...."
4,Missing piece,"We really love the actual chandelier but it was missing a hanging bead. Any idea how we would go about getting one sent? really don't want to send the whole thing back, just would like the missing piece."
1,Not worth the price.!,"Chandelier came in bent and it was shipped that way. Horrible material and cheap. Very small chandelier to be priced for $70.00 USD. Would not recommend. If they would sell it for $20.00 it would be in that catagory for cheap range.! The Picture makes it look so pretty and worth it. However, it is very deceiving."
5,This si the BEST book ever!,I loved this book. I am dying to see the movie. If there is a sequel then I have got to read it. The only thing is I don't think Buttercup deserves Westly. He risks so much for her. When she leaves him at the fireswamp I CRYED at how foolish and unworthy she is.But I still loved it.
1,Shameless profit taking and pablumization.,"I find this book quite offensive. Mr. Goldman is certainly not the rediscoverer of Morgenstern's book, which was never really lost. Rather he has produced a film edited version that is proof that modern publishers and producers have no confidence in the intelligence of their readership. Bypass this abridgement and seek rather for the original masterpiece."
2,Disappointing,"The Princess Bride is one of my all time favorite movies, so when I saw the ebook, I got very excited! Sadly, it was a waste if $4. The narrative was boring and distracting. I tried to force myself to fInish the book, but I just couldn't stand to read it anymore."
5,Great!,"My book right arrived on time, and exactly as they said. (It said like new, and- it was like new!)"
5,"I thought this was out of print, prepare to live forever!!!","Along with all the other books on this website, this is one of my favorites!!! The plot, in both the movie and the book, is fantabuloisticiferous (I invented that)! I hope everyone reads it at least once in their life."
4,Book surpasses the movie by far!,"The Princess Bride novel is way better than the movie. There are vital things that aren't played out in the movie. For example Buttercup's parents and her upbringing were not even mentioned in the movie. The history of the most beautiful women in the world was completely skipped over. Being a vital part of the book, the zoo of death was not portrayed at all. The movie used a tree for the torture setting, that just wasn't right. In the movie Fezzik and Inigo clubbed the albino to find Westley. Then Inigo used his father's sword to find the tree. That never happened in the book, they listened to the screams and followed them to the zoo of death. Fezzik and Inigo had to go through much more hardship to find Westley in the book. They had to fight all of the floors of the zoo of death before they reached level five. This created alot of suspense that was lacking in the movie. Overall the book was more suspensefull and surpassed the movie by far!"
5,It's got it all,"Revenge, pirates, damsels in distress, vicious animals, good guys, bad guys, giants and a couple of guys who are pretty darn good with swords, this book's got it all. Whether you're a fan of the movie, or just happened upon this book, I can guarantee you will like it,no matter if you're a fan of romance, action, suspense or comedy. William Goldman combines all 4 into one story you'll want to read over and over - I've gone through 4 copies, myself......GREAT BOOK"
1,Why can't you rate something 0 stars?,"This book not only deserves 0 stars...IT DESERVES NEGATIVE INFINITY STARS! This book is the absolute worst book I have ever read! (Just for your reference... there is NO love and NO high adventure in this book!) It only has stupid interuptions from the author. There is only one good thing about this book: the characters are so unrealistic that they are funny. Many times, I found myself laughing becuase of the stupidity of it all. Read this book if you want a laugh. Otherwise... Please, please, please, for the sake of the sanity of the world DON'T READ THIS BOOK! I guarantee that you WILL regret it. (Another thing just for your reference... this book has no plot)Do yourself a favor...DON'T READ THIS BOOK!"
2,The only person in the western world to not like this book,"I bought this book based on my love of the movie and universal raves from everyone. I haven't been this disappointed since I bought The Natural, (another screenplay that out did the original). William Goldman wrote the screenplay so I have no fault with him but where the movie was sharp and crisp, the book was too wordy, and (apparently only to me) lacking in virtually all I found romantic and exciting in my pre-reading the book experiences of The Princess Bride. I'm sure no one will find this review helpful but atleast I know that Mr Goldman can write a damn good screenplay from a subpar original story."
1,huge disappointment,"I had such high hopes. I love to read and had never gotten to the book after enjoying the movie repeatedly for so many years. Except for the middle of the book which has the actual story that was used for the movie, it's all BS. A bunch of stuff that means nothing. It doesn't even set up the story like another more favorable reviewer said. It is just a huge waste of time. And though I love to read, I do read slow and I felt like this author was just playing a big trick on me. So kudos for the part that was an actual story. Big fat boos to the rest of it."
2,The Princess Bride.,"The book was in great shape when I recieved it. The only problem was it was a little late. It took about 13 days to recieve it. Otherwise, it was in good shape."
4,A Classic,"I had never read The Princess Bride before, but I had seen the movie. I really enjoyed this abridged version of the book, but I did not know that it was not the full book until after I purchased it (guess I didn't read the info close enough). That being said, it is a great, classic story. Reading, I found myself picturing the characters from the movie and really wanted to watch it again afterwords.Even though I didn't realize it was an abridged version of the book, I am glad that I purchased it. William Goldman does a great job of cutting out the boring or unnecessary parts...leaving it ""the good parts version"" and he explains what he cut out and why.As a bonus, you get to read Buttercup's Baby."
1,"For once, the movie was better than the book","I love ""The Princess Bride"" as a movie, so I thought I'd like the book. I was so wrong.I slogged through it, hoping it might get better, and was disappointed the whole way through. Maybe someone else might find its sexist tone ironic or funny. I found it distasteful."
4,movie was more captivating,"I saw the movie before I read the book.Maybe because I am older, the book seems a little too slow in comparison to what I felt when seeing the movie.Good book anyway, would like to know if there is a really abridged book with nice illustrations for children.Gabriela"
4,Great Book!,"I think this book is a great novel. I am not usually interested in longer books, but since my class was reading it I was kinda forced to! Now that I am almost done I am loving it and I encourage people everywhere to read it! If you have any interest in books at all you will love this one written by William Goldman."
4,Not As GOOD as the Movie,"This book was not nearly as good as the movie. Although you can get a little clarity on certain parts of the movie, its not that entertaining. Its more comedy than the actual movie and tends to get a bit tedious to read. I did enjoy hearing a little more about each of the characters and their pasts which makes the book worth getting if you are a fan of the movie. Usually I would recommend skipping over anything that is a William Goldman insert since it usually takes away from the story more than it adds."
2,Okay,"I've read many good reviews for this book, so naturally, I had to see for myself how good it was. Well, I was disappointed. This book is definitely for very very very young kids. In fact, it may even bore some of the fantasy loving kids out there in the world. I liked the character of Westley, but I didn't really liked any of the other characters all that much. Overall, big big disappointment."
5,Clever and Enjoyable,"A fun, intelligent read. Author Goldman's tongue is firmly embedded in his lovable cheek. A great summer read, for a reader whise sense of humor is well-tuned."
5,"If you like the movie, you'll like the book","The Princess Bride is one of the funniest books and movies ever. The book is very light reading and very similar to the movie, which many people have seen. If you are looking at this because you liked the movie chances are you'd enjoy the book. However, don't expect too much extra detail or chapters more of new information. To the reviewer complaining about the ""abridged"" version-- there is no original version by S. Morgenstern, so really the problem is not an over-abridgement but perhaps not as much development as you would have liked."
5,Finally an attractive Cover with better material!,I got tired of seeing those nasty green vinyl covers on my furniture and was excited to find these taupe colored covers. They feel almost like canvas on the outside but the underside is smooth and soft. They don't have any flannel or fleece on them but I found on my previous vinyl covers with the soft flannel on the back got moldy after a few months in rain and heat (I live in FL so that may have made it worse). I've been using these for the past few months and actually have gotten compliments on how nice my patio looks AFTER I've covered everything.Definitely recommend.
2,Not big enough,"The below reviewer is correct on the size of this item (65"" by 23""), which was not listed in the description when I made the purchase. Unfortunately, it's not big enough to cover my table and 4 patio chairs"
3,Cover has a seam across the middle that isn't water tight,I'm very happy with the fit of the cover - however unlike my previous cover (which was way too big - and the wind kept catching) - this cover actually has a seam that runs right across the table top - and which apparently isn't water tight - as I can see a puddle of water forming under the center of the table (where the umbrella whole is the glass top). As covering the table was intended to result in instant usability - I'm not excited about the prospect of having to clean the table thoroughly anyway.
4,A Fine Companion Piece,"I'm very happy to see Wilco and Billy Bragg back in action together, producing a fine follow-up to one of the best albums in recent years. Fans of the first project will appreciate this more than others, so I'd encourage fans to spread the word about this high-quality performance. Bravo."
4,I bought this one first,"If you never heard the 1st CD, this one is really fresh. If you hear the first one first, maybe you won't like it as well. I think that 5 or 6 tracks are really outstanding. I've bought CD's for less good tracks before. Blood of the Lamb is my favorite... haunting, anti-racist, and very much in keeping with the Christian gospel. I also really enjoy Black Wind Blowing for the bluesy melody. Natalie Merchant sings a cute little song with no real meaning, but it's always nice to hear her voice. I'd buy it again."
1,huge disappointment,I loved the first Mermaid Avenue--the spirit of Woody's words were captured so exquisitely. Mermaid Avenue II is a huge disappointment. The sound quality is poor and the songs are worse.
3,Not Even Close to Vol. 1,"Well, this is what we get when outtakes (translation: music deemed by the band as not good enough to hear on Volume 1).Wilco shines here, but Bragg seems to be in a slump. Absolutely none of his songs surpass the ones from Volume One.I am not a big fan of being able to figure out the next four chords, in order, before they are played. This is Bragg's specialty here: cliche.My wife no longer lets me play this CD, because she cringes every time Bragg opens his mouth. The facsist rants are tiring at this point.Lets hope they move on to another folk great before they do Guthrie to death."
4,MMA2 is inconsistently good,MMA2 is not as consistently good as the first time around. There are several standouts such as Remember the Mountain Bed and Airline to Heaven but several clunkers make ya reach for the skip button a little too often.
2,A great book... in its time. Check out the 2nd edition.,"This was a great book in its time. It helped introduce me to SCSI, and I learned a lot from it. Unfortunately, it is 5 years old now and SCSI has changed dramatically --for the better-- since then. I have been anxiously waiting for an update, and am excited that one is finally on its way in March 2000. IF you are thinking about getting this book, I STRONGLY recommend you wait until the 2nd edition (ISBN: 1886411107) is released in March -- or pre-order it. At this point, this book is more of a history lesson than a technical guide. (PS, if not for the outdating of this book, it'd be a 5 star rating)"
5,Spielbergs Gremlins,The director that brought us many great movies such as Jaws to Saving Private Ryan. Gremlins isn't a movie with these potentials but when seeing it you can laugh and love the story of this small town being corrupted. In the sequel to the first Gremlins you get an amazing story as you got with the first taking place in the city that never sleeps. If you love movies The Gremlins dvd are movies to see and seeng how a director can give you action and comedy in a story such as this.
5,Love Key West,I love Key West and this puzzle and it reminds me of the trips I've taken there. Arrived in great condition and fast.
5,This is great - but the long version would be better!,"I saw this movie in NY when it first came to the US and loved everything about it. It's haunting, futuristic in an original way, and has interesting, quirky characters who I want to know more about. The soundtrack is also wonderful. I have never seen the long version but a description of it at [a website](""The strange case of Until the End of the World"")really makes me feel frustrated that the director's cut isn't out on DVD yet. Hurry up! - 10 years is long enough to wait for it."
2,Until the End of the World,"I bought this movie at a place in city. I watched it. And it didn't went up to my expectetions. First, I think Wim Wenders did put this movie too close to his own time. He did not consider research what would happen until the real 1999. And what was that thing about the atomic satellite? It wasn't mentioned so much in the movie. You can see that the Soviet Union is actually still intact, even though it ceased to exist the coming year. Secondary, much of the picture was too much centered on Clarie (Solveig Dommartin). You do not get to see the plot real close. And what IS the plot? A man who invent a machine that can record real life and insert it's memories into another human, and the US govenment trying to find it? For their own purposes? I recommend seing Blade Runner if you want to see a future thriler/sci-fi.Mind that this is MY rating for this movie, and should not be taken seriously. Thank You."
3,"Interesting and Intriguing, But By the End, Will It End?","Wim Wenders' ""Until the End of the World"" is one of the most fascinating films I have ever seen. It is a mixture of apocalyptic fears, anti-technology, dream interpretation, and addiction, which involves an international cast of characters and leaps from continent to continent at a dizzying pace. The plot is more than a little confusing, but essentially deals with Solveig Dommartin's character searching for William Hurt, who could (or could not) be an international industrial spy. Sam Neill plays Dommartin's boyfriend, and to say that their relationship is an open one is an understatement... The last quarter of the film drags... I would recommend it, but at over 2 1/2 hours long, it requires concentration and patience. However, you rarely get an opportunity to view films this creative, so it is worth seeing."
3,A BIG BLOATED MESS,"I love Wim Wenders, but his spark and genius has been on a steady decline since the late eighties. Until the End... suffers from being too big for its own good. While trying to encompass such a vast visual and intellctual landscape, the film stumbles on its huge ego. Thats not to say that it doesnt have its moments. There are some great scenes and preformances (with such a long running time, there has to be), but, in the end, they cant come close to putting life into this pompous magnum opus.When people herald this movie, it is purely out of respect for the films ambitions and out of reverance for Wim Wnders as a, at one time, notable film maker. If it had someone elses name attached to it, I garuntee, most circles would not hold it in such high regard."
5,An invaluable programmer's guide.,"Use programming standards, make code more reliable by eliminating questionable variables, and provide flexible error controls with the aid of this survey of common programming pitfalls and their solutions. Any working with Microsoft's Visual Basic program will find Practical Standards for Microsoft Visual Basic an invaluable programmer's guide."
4,Almost perfect,"I've only been doing ASP for about 6 months, and I found this book extremely helpful. There are a few things that I have always had questions about and others that I didn't understand at all. This hit just about all of them, and I feel as if I understand ASP much better now.The only problem was that I was hoping for a little more coverage of .Net than this book contained -- only one Appendix. On the other hand, I haven't been able to find much else at the bookstore yet. So, this is probably about as good as you're going to do."
3,My So-Called Normal Life,"A memoir about a 23 year old girl who finds out she has cancer while she works at glamour magazine. She learns to soak in life, to love those around her, and distill the important things in life from the vain and insignificant...although she still cares about her weight! She turns her tragedy into good work and action by starting to fund raise for the cancer society and with the help of glamour magazine raises 25,000+ dollars. There is another twist in the story. Completely unrelated her sister gets cancer as well, Hodgkin's lymphoma. Unlike leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma is curable. Leukemia is not...Erin will either need a bone marrow transplant or take this new medication for the rest of her life. They struggle with issues of mortality, fertility, and love - issues that many of us are not forced to deal with until much later. Interesting, quick read."
4,"easy to read, very informative...","It was written with warmth and honesty...I would highly recommend it for people who were diagnosed with leukemia or for the ones who weren't but still don't know how precious their lives are...After I read this book, I really decided to make some severe changes in my life, and I started with being so grateful for every good things I have.It should be handed out to the patients at every psycologists' offices to make the depressed ones feel better."
3,2nd Time's a Charm?,"The first time I got this it didn't work. Amazon was really good about replacing it for me so hopefully that's the only problem I have. The design of the product is pretty bad, there's no way to sit down with this on that's for sure. But if you take the actual vibrator out and wrap it in something you can get away with it. The range on the remote is great and even though there's only one setting, it's not bad. Overall: Whoever designed this is great with electronics (sometimes) and knows nothing about the female body..."
5,A Gem...,"""Book the Job"" is a true find. Doug Warhit offers alot of valuable information that is sharp, consise and easy to decipher. He also throws in just enough humor to keep the information entertaining and fun but never strays from the serious intent of helping you become a true working actor."
4,Beautiful presentation,"I read this book in its German language edition, but frankly almost anyone will enjoy this book in any language, as it is 90% comprised of simply gorgeous color plates and some charts.The book is an examination of one particular villa in Oplontis, a community along the main road slightly west of Pompeii and Herculaneum, buried in the volcanic eruption like the rest in 79 AD. The villa's ownership is attributed to Poppea, Nero's second wife, based on an inscription on an amphora found in the bathroom of the excavated villa; however, it is known that the property was not inhabited at the time of the explosion, undergoing either expansion or renovation, perhaps work still required as a result of the earthquake of 63 AD.In any evemt, the villa's layout, luxury, fantastic frescoes and decor, are all lovingly reproduced in this short book in stunning color. It lends real insight into the levels of luxury and sophistication attained by the wealthy at this time of the Empire."
1,Fugeddaboudit!,"Confusing, skimpy, and VERY hard to relate to what you see on your monitor. This gets one star only because that's the least this reviewing system will let me bestow. Dummies books are usually great-but not this thing. Not recommended."
4,Well constructed item,This kit is very well constructed and sturdy. All the parts are solid and don't feel as if they will break. The attachment heads just screw on and off and the telescoping pole really does reach very high. I have only used the different brushes thusfar to do some cleaning in corners of the house that I would otherwise have never reached.I give this a 4/5 just because I don't like to rate anything a perfect score. What would you then give to a better item?Buy with confidence on this... if you need a good kit to change bulbs and brush high ceilings.
5,HTC has not gone out of business,"HTC is alive and well and has just moved into a new office and factory in Fair Haven, MI"
2,To good to be true,This stand is very affordable however it does not stand up to daily use. I am a remodeling contractor who needs his tools to be able to take a variety of setups and lots of movement from job to job. This stand does not hold up. It is poorly constructed and cheaply manufactured. I was hoping it would be great considering the cost but after using it I am willing to pay more for a higher quality stand. Good luck!
5,Sadly Overlooked Action Adventure Comedy,"Christian Slater's character reminds me of a young Jack Nicholson, who replaces his brother on the Police Force after he is murdered. I was surprised that he didn't become as popular as Tom Cruise after this film was released in 1992, but he had a few personal issues during the 90s that stalled his career. I think he's a better actor than most people realize, with much more talent than making below average movies like ""Broken Arrow""."
4,"Kuffs, a comedy about growing up.","This was definitely one of my fave' movies of the 90's. Young tearaway George Kuffs (Slater)has just dumped his pregnant girlfriend, <Milla Jovovich> when his older, policeman brother Brad (Bruce Boxleitner - Babylon 5> is murdered. Hopeful for some payback, George joins the local police force in order to catch his brother's killer, whilst also attempting to win back the girl, and in doing so learns to grow up somewhat in the process. As the billboard in the movie says quite aptly really, 'Life: what happens whilst you're making other plans.'The soundtrack is also, just perfect for the film's different moods; 'I don't wanna live without you' may be the most moving song I've heard on a film. My only complaint is that it's not out on DVD!"
5,"Why, oh why, is this movie not on DVD?","I just have to say that I'm disappointed that this movie is not on DVD, and I seriously hope that someone, somewhere realizes the oversight and corrects the mistake. I loved this movie from the very beginning, with the action, romance, and suspense all packed nicely into an interesting plot. Please, please put this movie on DVD soon. My collection won't be complete without it!"
1,worst act of the decade,Christian slater is by far the worst actor. i have ever seen in my lifetime as a fan of the movie arts. he makes every role he does look like its fake. please give up acting and learn to sing and dance. he need a rizzle for this movie
2,Not much about JMF apart from the Java Media Player,"The name of the book suggested a complete guide to the JMF, but in fact it's a book about the Java Media Player ONLY. It contains almost nothing about the very important media broasdcasting and conferencing part of the JML. It's an disappointment to me. Well, to be fair, it could be a pretty good book for developers who want to use the Media Player part only."
2,Not for me,"I like the small size for the ability to carry it all the time. It's just too small to be useful as a stylus. If you want the ability to carry it, then go for it."
1,Seriously dated,"This book won't really help on a current (2005) developer's tech interview. Here's the reason: from the partial contents on the rear cover --* The 3 most marketable IBM mainframe DB/DC skills: IMS, CICS, and DB2/SQL* The most frequently asked technical questions on COBOL, VSAM, JCL, ...I can't say much about the sections of the book which relate to management etc, and I haven't skimmed the model resumes, either. However, there are other books (at lower prices) which would cover these. Oh, and the cover price of the book is $23.95. While it may be worth more due to its rarity, it certainly isn't worth the going rate of $30 for its technical content."
2,the worst,"sorry... but this movie is HORRIBLE... ok the end scene IS cool... but thats it. scattered good shots, but pulled off VERY lazily. worth seeing.. NOT worth buying. any comparison to ""a clockwork orange"" is an outrage.. nothing like it.. Mr. kubrick was a genius -DePalma's a hack... look at ""raising cain"" and ""snake eyes"" umm... anybody see ""body double""?? talk about lame."
4,The Phantom's DVD,"Since I've already talked about the film itself in the VHS review I'll just talk about the disc. The picture looks fine for a film shot in the mid-70's, the sound it the original Dolby Stereo soundtrack (too bad it's not 5.1 but it still sounds good in Pro-Logic II) and it comes with a trailer that's typical of it's time (pretty much, just a straight montage of clips with no narration). Over all, it's not great, but not bad either for a bear-bones disk. I don't see Fox releasing a special edition in the near future so for now I'd recommend this one."
5,phantom of the paradise kicks ass!!!!!!,"I saw this movie for the first time when I was 8 years old, and I will never forget it, I recently watched again, and personally I think it was ahead of its time. Giovanni gioramirez@aol.com"
4,composer phantom of paradise thtr travesty/tragedy,"or 5 stars for this excellent, special, rare, combo premise film by brian de palma; one of the verybest films of the 70's with few but very cool actors, colorful rock opera stuff that ends in a draw,very sadly unfortunetly, especially for our hero of this story-zee com po sar."
5,Powerful book for preachers!,I bought this book on the recommendation of a preacher that I well respect. He said that every preacher should read this book once a year for the rest of his life.... I am only part way through the book and I can already say that it has been a great blessing to read!
4,this stuff is dope,"i listened to this cd at a friends and it is dope as it gets, sin, raida, swift, rock the house on this album"
2,Ehh,"I think I loved the one song and that's why I bought it. I should've stuck with the single, the others did not grab me as much."
2,Not Worthy,"I purchased this book after I bought ""Ex Girl to the Next Girl"" and realized that it was a sequel so I had to get ""Got a Man"". First off the writer's style is a little too junior high for my taste. I have to agree with the reviewer that said if you are over 30 then DON'T BUY this book. Ms. Poole uses elementary school vocabulary, short sentences and tends to repeat herself (Ex: I hate Malik, he's so stupid I wish he would die, I hate Malik he's stupid"". Now if that doesn't sound junior high I don't know what does. If your looking to read something shallow then by all means buy this book. However, if you are looking for a juicy story with a more sophisticated style of writing then try reading books by Mary Morrison or Lolita Files."
2,Not what I expected!,"I was patiently awaiting Daaimah's second book ever since yo-yo love. I must say that the book was a little disappointing if you compare it with her first work, she repeated herself constantly, and most of the characters were predictable.. I would to give this book 2 stars because it has potential but could have been better..."
3,Necessary read if you are in the business,I would say this is an important book to have on your book shelf if you are in the evaluating or treating business in this area. it is a good basic starter for understanding the ins and outs of treating juveniles with these types of problems.
1,Save your money,"Followed the instructions precisely and took this product twice a day with meals. Didn't stop my craving sweets! Got more of a placebo effect, did nothing."
1,publisher's comments misleading,I would just like to comment that Carol R. Glatt's Editorial Review is grossly misleading. Judaism has not always discouraged converts.
1,Simple and non-memorable,"While this book was written in a simple and easy to read fashion, it was not memorable or particularly engaging. I never actually connected with any of the characters. Nuala was too perfect and Dermot was too stupid. I found the language idiosyncratic and the plot trite and boring. I never got into the book; I was always checking to see if I was close to the end. I would recommend this book to someone who does not like stories that are too complicated or clever."
4,"a good easy read,although somewhat predictable","amusing, light mystery and romance, read it in two days during holidays, the historic sections about the civil war are slow and dry, but the romantic sections are fun; I live in Chicago, and the geography was accurate, and I could identify the locations"
4,Ford GT,This the same as the OEM battery which comes with the FGT supercar.....the orginal last until December of 2012....six years is a lot to ask of a battery....
1,Waste of time,Do NOT waste your 1hr and 45 min of life watching this movie. Enough said. Now I see why it went straight to dvd.
2,Not the best thriller movie,"I rented this on amazon and I thought it looked like a great thriller. The first 20 min. or so isn't bad. The suspense was great, I thought. It didn't last too long before it got confusing and I had a hard time understanding what was really going on. So, I don't think this is that great of a thriller. I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Unpredictable,"Complex, unpredictable, worth watching. I never saw an ad for this movie and didn't know what to expect. watch it."
3,The Tall Man,"""The Tall Man"" was a decent movie with an interesting plot twist (actually a twist within a twist). The ending seemed confusing at first, but I think they did a good job of tying everything together."
3,OK film,It's an OK film with a good story.. Jessica Biel is one of my favourite actresses so that made it worth watching too.
5,Lovin the Rugrats!! :),"This Was an amazing season! It came 1 day before the estimated shipping, It included the 1 hour episode of Runaway Reptar (Which is my favorite) and it included the awesome episodes i grew up with! This is really reccomended to buy!!"
1,"Low quality, dirty","These wrenches are the worst I've ever used - they arrived looking like they'd been used by someone with dirty hands - both sets were that way. The chrome plating is poor. Even Harbor Freight wrenches are superior to these, and they are clean when you buy them."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A couple of threads to this book. The party involved in going after the magical Horn of Valere, which the bad guys have nicked.The females have to go and deal with the serpentine and savage politics of the sorceress types of the Aes Sedai, at their base, win the argument there, and stay alive.Rand, by the end, is definitely not your rural village kid anymore."
2,*yawn* Are we there yet?,"One of the most boring books I've ever read(or half-read anyway). I trudged through the first book despite its lack of direction, but I can't do it anymore. What is the point? Nothing ever happens! This is not good fantasy, it's not even mediocre.I suppose the entire series will be saving me some money. Thank you Mr. Jordan.:^)"
4,i skipped like 200 pages!!,"the book is drugged out, kinda like (from what i have herd)7-10 in the series. in the beginning, it is really good, and up til about page 400 it is a good novel, but there is a lot of filler, hell i skipped nearly everything with egwene and the aes adi. i read the test for nyvagene, and then egwene with the novices, but i found myself really more into rand and his co. i personally think the aes adi didn't need to be in there. correct me if i'm wrong. I still believe the series is good, but i might have to start skipping books if i read one and figure u all r right"
5,#2 is hard and Jordan makes good,"Jordan's second book of the series gives a clue as to the scope he is attempting, in charactrer development and hints at prophesy. Like the first book in the series, this one is VERY engaging and provides a satisfying ending to a portion of his epic tale. Where the first leaves you wondering if you really know who the main character is, this one lets you know that EVERY character he includes has interest and importance.Though I have lately become disgruntled with this never-ending series, I cannot begrudge that, even on a third reading, this and the other early books truly hold their own. It is these early master-works that keep me buying the latest on the day of it's arrival."
5,totally hooked,so pleased to discover this great fantasy epic. Great plot and characters and very well written. Such a pleasure to read it. Will be looking forward to reading the whole saga.The Great Hunt: Book Two of 'The Wheel of Time'
5,A correlation of imagination and personal dreams come true!!,These books are outstanding! The Eye of the World was great and following was the hypnotic Great Hunt. Robert Jordan takes you to a place of unbelievable imagery with all the detail included. How can you go back to other books after being on the Robert Jordan fantasy level.I can not wait to hear more about Nyneyve and the rest of the girls. The guys are facinating also but the women have the power!!I will have all of them read soon!!
1,Stolen Ideas,"This series hardly promises to be new or unique. Unlike others, I don't care that Jordan rips off Tolkien (trollocs, anyone?). Instead, I'm furious that he has stolen characters straight out of Eddings's Belgariad: the sturdy blacksmith with down-to-earth values, the haughty, blue-clad, imperious sorceress, the vagabond old man storyteller, and even a connection with wolves. The opening of the first novel, where Rand suspects some shadowy figure following him is also straight out of Pawn of Prophecy. Why hasn't Eddings sued this poser? Also, the boys vs. girls theme that Eddings began to take a little too far by the 8th book (in the Mallorean) is already overdone obnoxiously by the end of book 1. Surely we can find better authors that don't steal their ideas straight from better sources. Read Eddings and compare for yourself. Jordan is a thief."
4,On with the show...,"The last third of this book is where the series really starts taking off. It's a bit frustrating how Jordan never seems to get to the point: there's a lot more empty space than necessary in The Great Hunt, everything between Fal Dara and The Toman Head isn't so essential to the storyline. But the end... well, here we can really see, for the first time, what Jordan can do at his best.The first appearance of the Seanchan is a positive shock. The whole thing really knocks you out, and then, when our heroes stumble into that long before seen clash with them, the thrill is superb. Excellent writing. And, of course, there's a lot more to come..."
4,too many characters,"This IS a good book, but it is just not as tight as the first one. The author starts wandering into political intrigues and lots of new characters, so many it is hard to keep up with who is who at times. I love the action!"
4,More must reading!,I really love this series! In this one we learn that Rand Al Thor is the one that was being sought in the first book. I don't want to give you any more spoilers than that. The Great Hunt is every bit as entertaining as the first on in the series. It's easy to see why so many have discovered these books. Word of mouth travels fast!
3,everyone loves this series but me,This is a hugely popular series but I stopped reading after the second book. It was too similar to other story lines that I've read and it didn't hold my interest to go another 15 books.
3,It's okay...,"I really liked the first book. Something so creative and engaging! Second book was ok. By the third book, I had completely lost interest. I can't imagine how Jordan stretched this series out into so many books. I would definitely read the first book, but after that, I feel like Jordan is forcing more stories out of the same theme."
3,it's all about Rose,"The movie is not bad but not great,the most enjoyable part is the super hot Rose Mcgowan,she is so sexy and she has the most perfect breasts I've ever seen."
1,Unfunny and Uninteresting and Un...something else.,"Once again the debilitating disease of genre-itis infects another film production. Film companies seem incapable - due to the bottomless idiocy of distributors (and themselves) - to consider making any film which doesn't conform completely to a specific genre. So here we have a typical road movie: contrived, impossible to believe in or care about, dull, predictable and badly acted by third division actors. No great dialogue, no clever or inventive plotting, no laughs, no action, no emotions...just a banal, depressing trawl through middle American ""culture"", conducted by actors who seem to have had a charisma bypass operation. I've seen hatstands with more screen presence. My advice: avoid this dross."
2,Programming with Visual Age for java,"Full of enthusiasm I approached this book with an open mind convinced I had found the right text. I like to quickly overview technical books to discover early on where the authors are leading. I often learn a great deal in this way. Not with this book, you must be prepared to be at a keyboard and concentrate on each line. There is so much between the lines and you can miss important facts if you dont think hard. You cannot breeze in to a chapter, you must work on them all in the right order. Once in there it's like being led through a maze. There is virtually no explanation of what you are doing. The theory is lacking. Terminology is thrust upon you ruthlessly. You learn a bit about the GUI in VAJ, and it helps with general familiarity with the software, oh yes, the bit you really want to know, you don't learn much about Java."
1,waste of time + money,"The book is full of typo's and the authors are impossible to reach. Hardly any explanation during the exercises, just instructions. A better book for the beginner is ""Enterprise Development with VisualAge for Java, version 3,"" by Nilsson et al."
2,Road to disaster,"I gave it two stars for cinematography only. Otherwise it's pretty bland, you'll regret watching it all the way through. Bratty kid and messed up dad traveling through Russian country side depending on kindness of strangers as they go. Some people are nice and some are less than kind, it has potential at first then it drops off precipitously."
3,Good but unrealistic,"This is an entertaining and charming film. It's got three of my favorite things in it: Carmen Maura, the wonderful city of Lisbon, and the French language. A good ""Europic"". However, the concept that Lisbon is a completely bilingual city where everyone speaks French is pure fiction. I've been to Lisbon several times and have spent extensive time there. The idea that everyone speaks French there is pure fantasy. You can expect everyone to speak Portuguese, of course, and maybe a lot of people speak Spanish and/or English but the status French was given in the film was the result of a silly Francophone/Francophile fantasy. Still, this film was very cute and well done."
1,worked for 6 months.....,sounded good for the money. but then it broke 6 months later. if you buy it make sure you get a replacement warranty. I am going to buy a better one next time. you get what you pay for.
4,A great inexpensive book to get you started in web design,"Although the book is oriented around Photoshop on the Mac (which is even better if you use a Mac), the concepts are universal. The book is visually pleasing, very informative (especially on graphic formats), and an inexpensive way to get started"
1,Great CD in terrible condition,I have always loved Joe Diffie. I think he's an awesome songwriter and an incredible performer. But if I had known when I ordered this CD used that it would be one that had apparently had been used to take the grit out of sandpaper then I wouldn't have bothered. I'll never again pay for a used CD from anyone. Buyer beware as the saying goes.
5,Joe Diffee,i was very pleased with the cd joe Diffee greatest hits it bought back alot of memories and I am very pleased with it thank you Amazon
1,The Awful A&E Production,"If you've never read Forester, then fine, buy and enjoy. But, these miserable productions deviate so far from the original books that the character and storylines are unrecognizable. After A&E aired this excrescense, I emailed them thus:""You ought to have your grog stopped.""Why, oh why, when people turn books into movies or video, can't they stay true to the original? The BBC managed to do so, with the ""Sherlock Holmes"" series (well, they went far afield with ""The Adventure of the Priory Hall"", but the rest were splendid).End of rant."
5,horatio hornblower the complete adventures,All the dvd's I have purchased through Amazon.com have been everything I expected them to be. I absolutely will use Amazon.com in the future.
2,o'reilly should be embarrased!!,I read the book a number of years ago to learn pthreads.I found numerous errors in the examples -- speakingat work to a colleague I recall we laughed at this book --It was such a disaster.I may read the book again (over the last few years I learned a lot aboutpthreads) and give a careful analysis of it.I had a first printing -- there were gobs of errata onOreilly's site -- maybe they put in enough corrections sothe examples run -- but I'm amazed how shoddy the first printing was.Stay away from it...
4,Pretty good but not great,"The pockets are a little too narrow for many things but the gadget is very well made and durable. There are the two side loops that can be used for a screwdriver (guy on the site ""do they still make those...?"") or pencil. with storage for a little bit larger stuff it would be perfect as it is its very useful. No problems with anything falling out.Has a nice metal clip that fits snugly even over a 4"" belt so it doesn't come off when you sit down."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTING AND POORLY EDITED,"If you are a die-hard VU fan, then you probably had this show already in one bootleg format or another. I must admit, that this packaging job is outstanding. The booklet, the photos, the slipcase...everything about it, visually, is extraordinary and immaculate. However, what is it they say about ""judging a book...?""The actual recording is CRAP. When this was originally issued on bootleg vinyl, the mix was recorded quite a bit too slow...which is the problem here. Unfortunately, the sound editors for this potentially stellar CD ignored modern technology completely, which is to say they did not download a sound editor for free off of the internet! Any freeware editing program could speed the mix up enough for Lou, Cale, and Nico to sound normal.I have a bootleg of this that not only sounds better, but has more songs! My 20 year old VHS tape of the concert sounds better than this.What a disappointment. Hopefully, this can be reissued after it is properly edited."
3,Decent album,"This is a good album with many good songs; however, if you really liked the album with Wonderwall, you should just by that album."
3,It's OK,"This product looks OK, however it was difficult to assemble and needed some revision. The instructions were not easy to read and the construction poor.The top part of the braces for the mirror didn't match. They both pointed in the same direction instead of one to the left and one to the right.Thanks to my daughter and son-in-law, they were able to fix it so I wouldn't have to repack and return such a large item.I would not recommend thisPowell Mission Oak Cheval Mirrorproduct to anyone."
5,Oak Cheval Mirror,"I chose a 5-star rating because everythig about the purchase went smoothly from start to finish. Arrival of the product was prompt (we were facing a deadline) and assembly was easy (not that I touched it, but it just did not take my husband very long at all. It is an asset to our bedroom!"
4,Beautiful,"this is just what I was looking for, only at a much better price! Was very easy to put together and is secure and well made. revived much sooner than expected."
4,This movie is utterly charming and engaging,I love this movie! It's fun. It's pretty. It's charming. The characters are funny and lovable. The scenario is clever and engaging. The mix of French and English is enriching. It couldn't be better. Try it!
4,Beautiful visuals,"I love reading the Toot & Puddle books to my daughter. The art is beautiful and is full of details not found very often these days. This story has a moral and is a nice segue to the conversation about ""being yourself."" And who doesn't want that?The only reason I wouldn't give this book 5 stars is because I enjoy the other Toot & Puddle books a little more. This one is just a bit too modern in it's content. The others tend to be more about core childhood and timeless values.But still, the visuals are amazing."
2,a little harsh,"I am a huge fan of Toot and Puddle, so I didn't pre-read this book before purchasing. Unfortunately, I don't really want to read it to my son (who asks for Toot and Puddle every day) because the story ends up calling one of the characters a ""prima donna"" and then proceeds to explain what they mean by that (which isn't any better than the name-calling was by itself).Maybe many parents wouldn't mind this book, but I am careful to try to avoid examples of name-calling.Of course, the pictures are incredibly beautiful as usual, and there is a nice lesson in the story, as usual. I just wish authors as well as tv cartoon writers would be more aware of name-calling. I wouldn't want to hear my little guy or girl calling one of their friends a prima donna, no matter how well the shoe fits. I know they will learn name calling at some point in school or even the playground, but this story makes it look ok to label a friend like that."
2,Aikido a sport?,"Aikido was never meant to be a sport and has never even considered itself to be. True aikido rejects all forms of contests and tournaments. Only Public demonstrations are given or should be given to show a display of constant training, not of ego accomplishment from the likes of sports where there is a winner and a loser. Aikido is not about who wins, who's tougher, or who is better, it's about personal achievement of mind/body. I must ask all to be cautious of such writings involving aikido being made to look like a sport or any competition. The founder himself and his family have always shared this view and rightly so. 2 stars for the knowlege that might be attained for the positive use and understanding of the art."
1,"Poorly Made, Horrible Assembly","I have been in the process of selecting a screen for my theater and have tried Elite, Da-Lite, and this company. I have to say that the construction of this product is the worst. The framing rods go together badly and there are many other problems that are wrong with the unit. The actual screen quality was mediocre compared to the Elite and Da-lite. Even though they all had similar screen gain, this unit really had a significant loss in color reproduction. I won't get too extensive due to the time I need to write this properly, but this shouldn't be rated at 5 stars as it was previously."
2,Not so great,"Fit was okay for my 2009 Civic, but material (carpet) was very flimsy, so much so that you could easily see light through it. I returned it for a refund and will look elsewhere for a dashboard cover of higher quality."
4,Good Value for the Cost,"This dash cover is really an excellent value for the low price. But if you're picky about the color matching the interior of your vehicle perfectly... or if you want a precision fit and finish... then you could be a little disappointed. I bought a caramel colored model for a 2006 Honda Civic Hybrid, and the DashMat color doesn't match (or even compliment) any of the browns or tans in the vehicle. But it's tolerable and quite usable. The fit isn't perfect either, but quite good. The quality of the materials and construction are fine."
2,Basic Stuff,"I recommend this book to someone who is not familiar with Windows 95/98. It covers the basics of the operating system in a consistently unentertaining manner--a characteristic of almost all books on software. (Of course, the intent is to educate, not entertain.)There's no heavy duty stuff here. So if your sole purpose in life is to decode the Windows Registry, click the ""Next"" button now."
5,"A tale of personal destruction, remorse, and redemption.","I found Under Western Eyes to be Conrad's finest work and perhaps, along with Anna Karennina, the greatest of novels. The story of a young Russian whose life is destroyed by a misguided Russian revolutionist. The depth of the characters and the moral power of the storyline make this a must read for all (not too difficult)."
3,Well writen older style book,"Interesting book. This was not at all what I thought it would be as I thought I was getting a Western, turns out it is a story of the Russian revolution from western view point. I have read many Russian authors in the past and have some back ground into the Russian mind set of the early nineteen hundreds. I found it interesting as I like to read about history, but some might think it wordy. It is really amazing to read some of the famous authors from the past and realize what a fantastic grasp of the english language they had as well as a huge vocabulary."
5,My second reading,I have read this whole series and thoroughly enjoyed it. It is a fun fast read with laugh-out-loud moments. It is a whimsical story and pure fun.
5,Amazing,I love this book! It's exciting and entertaining. A wonderful read.A definite book to get off you like historical romance with modern twist.
1,A weighty work of historical fiction this is not,"There were some clever parts to this novel and some of the characters were rather humorous and entertaining but, in the end, this book was nothing more than a romance novel masquerading as historical fiction. I was HUGELY disappointed in it."
2,too predictable but still good,"I finally got a chance to read this book, recommended by a local store clerk. Unfortunately, when I got to the chapter in which Eloise finds information that might help her find out who the Pink Carnation is, it was easy from then on for the reader to know who the Carnation was indeed. It was way too predictable. The story (of all these spies) *is* interesting, it's just too bad that Willig could not come up with other possibilities to tell the reader who the spy was. In the end, there was no twist, and the ending actually left me unsatisfied. No, I won't spoil it and tell you who is the Carnation, you will find out yourself when you read it. And no, I will not read the follow up of the book, The Masque of the Black Tulip.Despite this, Willig's writing is quite enjoyable, and the book reads very easily. If you like predictable novels, you'll definitely enjoy this one."
3,Entertaining light read,"I wouldn't call this a historical novel. True, a few of the characters actually existed, but that doesn't make this a historical novel when so little of it is of significance to the story.As a chick lit, I would say it is entertaining. I agree with other reviewers' sentiment that our heroine's (Amy) immaturity is a bit irritating (so is Purple Gentian), but as a light entertainment, it serves its purpose. I was disappointed that though the title of the book suggests it is about Pink Carnation, it is more of a story of Purple Gentian and his love story (though the author didn't do much to develop their love, but focused on physical attraction).In the end though, I was entertained. Don't expect a serious, well-written book. Rather, expect to be lightly entertained."
2,"Badly written, tedious dialogue, inconsistent characters","This story seemed to have a lot of promise while still carrying desirable light-read elements. Unfortunately the author can't write dialogue and can only imagine romance blossoming from people who banter in unclever, unrealistic (even for a romance novel) fashions. I didn't give this ""one star"" because of the fresher-than-average plot. Too bad someone with a gift for writing didn't pen this."
2,Blah,"I love to find new authors, and I will look to see what else they have written so that I can enjoy this new storyteller-but, I can't with this book. This had been a bookclub pick, so I didn't have a choice in reading this book. It was very hard to get into-seriously-the book got somewhat engaging at around page 300 or so. I felt that it was a step above a ""typical"" bodice-ripping book, but not by much. It was a very ""fluff-filled"" book. It was very easy chick lit and a little to blah for me."
2,Disappointing,I expected an intriguing spy novel not a Harlequin romance with terminally immature protagonists. I gave up after 94 pages.
2,Disappointed,"I really wanted to like this book, and I did for about the first half. Towards the end the story just became too unbelievable. It seemed as though the characters were fully modern individuals who just happened to be wearing period clothing. The so called spies were as inconspicuous as an elephant in a china shop. The very end up of the book was really the last straw for me, it was incredibly cheesy and predictable, and worst of all entirely implausible.The dual storyline of the modern Eloise had potential, but never went anywhere and was therefore unnecessary and didn't flow with the ""historical"" (I use the term loosely in regards to this book) storyline."
5,Memories,"Great album. Using for a special luncheon at my volunteer organization for a funny skit for us ""old folks"" :)"
3,Mono ???,"It's wonderful to have this excellent material available again, but MCA dropped the ball--except for two tracks, everything here is mono, although most of it was widely available in true stereo on vinyl. Somebody fell asleep at the wheel here!"
3,My son loves it,"It took a bit of effort and time for my son to understand how best to use the controllers (it was very frustrating for him), but once he got it he'd had a great time."
3,Science fiction for collectors,"""Space 1999"" is maybe not as flashy and quick as modern science fiction movies, and the special effects are rather simple. Still, the story still holds, and a true fan of science fiction will probably like to take a closer look.The adventures at moon base Alpha are similar to those in Star Trek (somewhere between the original Star Trek series and The Next Generation) - with a clear taste of the late 70's.The mood and sceneries in ""Space 1999"" feel rather similar to those seen in ""2001 - a Space Odyssey""."
4,"The book is good, but...","If you are searching for an inside look into the world of courtesans, you will be disappointed. A courtesan is a high priced prostitute, but I am still waiting for any mention of any sex act. The title implies that these are memoirs of her experiences as a courtesan, not her life outside of her chosen profession.The story is pretty good in itself, but it doesn't get into depth on the professions of these women at all. Instead, this woman talks about growing up and meeting people. There's really nothing indicating she's a courtesan beside the fact that she just says so.It is beyond me why this book was condemned because of ""immoral and unsuitable for public consumption"". I am still waiting for anything remotely showing that such a phrase fits at all. She seems more like a courtesan wannabe than a real one."
5,perfect father's day gift,"I bought this for my father because he's always loved planes and he likes any books about planes. But I am probably going to have to get another copy because I started reading the story of the Kee Bird and couldn't put the book down. It's a real adventure, and I'm halfway through and can't believe what just happened with the plane. (Anyone who's read it knows what I'm talking about!) I am really hoping Gary and Darryl get things to work out -- but whatever happens, I am amazed that the author could make planes so incredibly fascinating. And all the strange people who are so in love with them that they'll risk life and limb just to bring back a piece. It reminds me of the Perfect Storm: a book I didn't think was my thing, but: incredible story, great writing, perfect gift."
5,continuing the best series on TV,"The season that continued getting everyone hooked, what could be better than catching up on the season that got you started on Dexter."
4,"Still killer, though slightly weakened","It's just odd to watch the spatter analyst/choosy serial killer Dexter Morgan do things like think about marriage and fatherhood in this season, which is not nearly as tense as the earlier seasons were. You pretty much know who he's going to kill; it's just a matter of time.His voiceovers are as entertaining as ever, Debra is still swearing up a storm, and Jimmy Smits does a good job as an attorney who wishes to partner with Dexter in getting rid of anyone deemed to be a bad guy. There are also several close calls during which Dexter's activities are almost revealed.Dexter also tries to separate somewhat from Harry and the Code, with mixed results.I'd be curious to see what would happen if Debra, who is gaining power, ever gets too close to discovering the truth about her brother."
2,Skips out of the box,Very disappointed with this dvd set. The actual story line in dexter is superb but the dvd set itself skips beyond belief. I could not even finish the season on this product. I would not buy from this seller again.
5,#1 Dexter fan!,Each season seems to bring more drama and hightens the need to watch the next season! I can't wait to have them all on my kindle!
5,Fabulous Show - Fast Shipping,The 3rd season of Dexter was even better than the first two seasons. I can't wait for the fourth to come out. This product shipped quickly and cheaply. I love amazon for it's service and selection.
2,boooo....boring episode,"After the previous season, this was pretty poor. The series has picked up since then, but this episode was boooooriiiiing."
1,A big disappointment!!!,"The third season was in no way comparable to seasons one and two. And you know, that if a show adds a baby to the plot it is on the way down. Seasons One and Two were multi layered. Three was just predictable. The Ice Truck Killer was wonderfully developed. The Skinner was a pathetic parody with very little intelligent development. You knew right from the beginning what Jimmy Smits character was headed for. By the way what happened to Deb's previous boyfriend? Are we just to assume that he headed off for another Serial killer and Deb was just fine with that? Where is all that multi character interplay/tension that was so wonderfully developed in S1&2? Now everybody is nice nice? PS: to the person that thinks Dexter is the best show ever made television. I beg to differ: it was The Sopranos!"
1,"Great Show, Very Poor Quality DVD","I LOVED the first two seasons and watched them through Netflix's streaming and then bought these discs to catch up on the third season.Apart from other shows' episodes, there are NO Special Features in this set. Well, if you have a DVD drive in your PC and don't mind running software from the drive, there is supposed to be an interview or two. I have a Mac and the disc locked up my computer twice--that never happens, but this disc did it both times.The video transfer is grainy and well beneath acceptable. While playing in my HD-DVD player, the video played at what appeared to be maybe 12 frames per second. Not acceptable.UPDATE: While playing on my Blu-ray player, the frame rate is better and only occasionally gets out of sync. The picture is still grainy and there are still NO special features."
2,Dexter: Great up until........,"I love the series DEXTER and would have given it five stars, however...After thoroughly enjoying the first two seasons of Dexter, we quickly found season 3 on Amazon and had to get it! We bought it, it was delivered, and we watched it. Yeehaw!!Then I put in the last disc (Dexter season 3 disc 4) and was getting ready to watch the last disc which has the season finale on it when it came on my screen as Season 2 disc 3. OMG!!! I can't see the last episode because the last disc is not what it says it is.I contacted the seller, and they sent me another one. Unfortunately it has the same problem. I contacted them again letting them know that the new disc has the same problem.I haven't heard back from the seller.I have written Paramount home video about this and haven't heard anything.How disappointing!!"
2,Slow decline,"Season one was great, season two was good, but season three was like watching a soap opera. I hope the writing gets back to like it was for season one where Dexter was so much darker."
3,Where is this box set?,"This was due out ages ago. I think it's being shown in the UK before being released here. Does anyone know if that's true? Highly irregular! I hope I'm wrong.I rated it 3 stars because I haven't seen it yet. I hope it's a 5, tho."
5,Dexter Rules,"If you are at Season 3 of Dexter, then you are hooked. Jimmy Smits is awesome as the guest star for this season. If you haven't yet seen Dexter, you need to watch each season in order, so that you get to know all the characters who appear in each of the three seasons. The only problem we have is deciding when to stop, as we usually watch 3-4 episodes at one sitting (We just finished watching the 2nd season a month ago)"
5,Great film,This is a must have for all Shah Rukh Khan fans. Great story. Good acting. It does get intense. Shah Rukh Khan is heroic.
3,Could be designed better,"I purchased this extension with a WoodOwl Tri-cut wood boring bit because the WoodOwl drill bits have such positive reviews. While the extension looks to be solidly constructed, and it is well balanced and rotates remarkably true in my drill, the set screw design could be improved. The setscrew is coarse threaded instead of fine threaded, which I believe would hold better, and it sticks out beyond the circumference of the extension when it is tightened against the drill bit. The extension would follow a 3/4"" bit through the hole if the setscrew tightened flush. Also, the hex wrench supplied is machined a tad too small and it rounded out the first time I used it. (However, I did find another hex wrench that works) I will either have to find a shorter setscrew or a whole other extension where the setscrew tightens flush."
5,Excellent,"Although I have not read the original story, this movie was definitely worth watching. I won't tell you what you already know, but I will say that this is an excellent and thought-provoking story and the cinematography was well done also."
4,Great Quick Reference,I own several of these Pocket Reference books and I find them invaluable. They are concise and give me just the information I need in a quick no frills manner. I keep them handy when I'm coding pages so I don't waste alot of time looking something up I just need a refresher on.
4,The Nile Tributaries of Abyssinia,"The book was a great description of the exploration of Africa during the late 19th century. It was somewhat hard to ""get-in-to"", by sometimes spending too much time on descriptions of less important issues and too detailed regarding some personal issues, particularly in the early parts of the adventure. Baker seemed to pat himself on the back quite often.As the story progresses, my interest grew and by the end, I wished that the book had gone farther with Baker's explorations. As a hunter myself and by today's standards, I was somewhat ""taken-aback"" by what seemed to be just too much ""sport killing"" of animals, however, one must remember it was a different time and place.Overall, the book rates 4 stars for it's history, content, and for putting a face on one the great and difficult explorations of the time."
2,if u wanna go to sleep....,this book is the most boring piese of garbage i ever had to read take it from a child that went through drivers ed the pictures are outdated some of the laws are wrong and it is extremely boring there is nothing in this book that is on the drivers test the only way to learn is through experience
3,3-D,"Got this for my husband to replace an old one. He does not care for the shape as it is 3-sided rather than 2-sided. It needs to be described as 3-sided on site. This makes it less functional. Quality is nice, but not as comfy as hoped."
1,lousy,"this product is ng. they have evidently substituted a new rubberized material inside the pillow, which makes it a poor sleeping surface. My neck hurts worse than before."
1,Not firm enough for me,Didn't seem firm enough for my needs.I did keep it for my casual chair.But didn't get enough support - too soft - needed to be more firm.
5,Great for people with neck issues!,"I had been unable to find the right pillow for me, and would always wake up with a stiff neck. I have tried very expensive tempurpedic pillows, but nothing worked. My massage therapist uses these pillows on her table and I loved how comfortable it was during my sessions. This DogBone pillow was a very inexpensive way to solve my neck problem!! I bought 3, and I travel with one. I never leave home without it!!"
3,And a Tragedy Nonetheless!,"Patricia Springer writes a decent true crime book about the abduction and murder of a six year old Texas girl named Opal Jo Jennings. She was murdered by a pedophile who is obviously lying to the police from the very start. I had trouble with that part of the book. I didn't believe the killer's lies and bull stories about him dropping her off at the store. He was obviously the kidnapper and killer but failed to find her remains until five years later. The story begins with Opal and two year old cousin Spencer who witnesses the abduction and her cries for help. Saginaw, Texas is the last place that you would expect something like this happen in broad daylight but it did. It can happen anywhere. Opal was living with her grandmother while her mother strived to make a living in North Dakota. She had allowed her own mother to gain custody of Opal for a better upbringing. The life on the street is never the same again."
4,Excellent attempt to make Rome accessible to children,"Based on ancient sources, both the texts and the images make Roman history come alive. The latin is there along with a decent translation and occasional commentary though by whom is not clear. Likewise the illustrations are uncredited but the original source is labeled well including the period and the location. The focus is really on the Empire period of Rome with only a few pages about the legendary foundations and the late Republic. So the book is misnamed a bit."
5,3 Videos in one DVD,- Good fun for younger kids- Educational- DVD comes with 3 episodes as described. Better than the old VHS versions with one episode per.- Enjoy!
3,DOUBLE TROUBLE,THE RATING I CHOSE IS OKAY BECUZ I DON'T REMEMBER TO MUCH ABOUT THE CLASS MOVIE AND LOVE SECRET ADMIRER. I LIKE THE ROMANCE MOVIES TO FIGURE OUT IF SOMEONE GETS TOGETHER OR NOT AND IF THE RIGHT PERSON IS FOR THEM AND I DISLIKE THAT THEY COULD BE BETTER . I RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHO LIKE 80 MOVIES
4,Easy to use and convenient to carry a single dose with you,"If you have complicated medications that need to be somewhat airtight, this case is good. My only complaint is that plastic seems a bit flimsy. Helpful if could have smaller version (narrower)"
3,A good Study Guide,"The title says alot, it is a study guide, and effective at that. It is not a full course on SQL Server Database Design. You must have a previous understanding of databases, and have the software to practice with. Sure, there are some slight errors, but they are obvious typos, and should get the brain working. I used this to focus on the subjects to be covered in the exam. Not for the newcomer to SQL Server."
5,Good study Aid,"This book worked for me, and I'm quite pleased with it. Excellent sections on Summarizing Data, and on Implementing trigeers (w/ and excellent subsection on enforcing Referential Integrity). I really liked the CD- it's got a great html version of the study guide which allowed me to take the CD w/ me, and din't make me lug around the text otself. Also, unlike the reader below, the fact that the questions were from the book didn't hinder the experience for me. It takes those questions (which are for the most part strong ones) and puts them into a testing engine which allowed me to focus on areas I need work on. All in all, this ws a great buy for me, and one I would recommend to others."
3,"solid, catchy album","i have had the pleasure of seeing hot rod circuit and they do put on a good show. many of the songs they played were from this album which was fun because they are great to sing along too. that is a good and bad thing. the melodies and lyrics quickly get stuck in your head but some songs become deriavitive and fall into that slightly sappy pop punk formula. still this is a solid album with songs such as ""the pharmicist"" and ""cool for one night"" being standouts. if your a fan or love pop punk buy it if not maybe dowload a few tracks. solid album"
2,Very disappointing,"What started as an interesting plot, with a appealing, guileless protagonist, just never went anywhere for me. The premise seemed less ""Di Vinci Code"" and more ""The Eight,"" but this book was no where near either. The hook of the artifacts was never realized in the story, and I found myself skimming huge sections trying to find out the point of it all. Unfortunately, there never really was one. Worst of all, not only did the protagonist not grow with the story, but he regressed. I basically couldn't wait for the book to end, even with it's very disappointing ending, so I could get on to something else. I'd say to give this one a miss."
2,Mostly disappointing,"This is a somewhat well written book. Character development and dialogue are much better than in DaVinci Code. The plot is weak, however. The part of the plot set in the former USSR might sound OK to a westerner, but to me, a Russian native, most of it sounds na?ve and poorly researched. You might like this book if you believe in magic, alchemy and easy to convince in general. Otherwise read Umberto Eco."
3,"A good quick read, but lacking in depth","Many who liked The DaVinci Code and similar titles will enjoy this book. THe characters are not particularly well developed, and the author seems to want to drop a lot of names and places without always checking them out, e.g., a BMW engineer who works in Stuttgart? That should be Munich, unless he works for the competition. All in all, a fun read for a medium length plane flight and a commendable first book."
2,Had to skim over whole chapters to keep my interest!,"This book is neither the rattling good read that the Da Vinci code is, nor the cerebral intelligent historical work of Umberto Eco and falls somewhere in between.Not keen on these novels that alternate chapters in the past and present. The plot held great initial promise but the author isn't successful in tying both plot lines together. I ended up skim reading or just omitting chapter after tiresome chapter just to get the thing finished - as the historic plot wasn't going anywhere, I concentrated on the simpler modern day murder mystery plot. Would be interested in other works by this author though."
2,I love the Elemental Heroes!,"Without the Elemental Heroes, this is not fun. but it completes my yugioh collection."
5,"great mirrors, got here fast","Mirrors were as they said they would be, used them for a mosaic class I taught. These mirrors are sturdy and great for these projects."
5,Very Handy,"I enjoyed this product so much I bought two. It will hold enough tools to do most any qucik job around the house, as is less cumbersome than a full tool pouch. I was surprised at just how much I could get in one. I even put in my small electric screwdriver. While building my home, this pouch was indespensible. It was great for holding tools to install ceiling fans, and plumbing."
3,Excelent carrier,"I just keep ending up with more tools, until i lose them anyway. I am a fan of using anything that saves time. It sure beats using just your back pocket . You can set up your tools in this pouch which saves the time your spending now looking around in your pockets. When I am doing a something fast, and dont want to carry all the boxes to the site, it pays for itself."
2,bad sticth,I bought the rear guard about a year ago. I REALLY liked the style.I wore it all the time but it startd to tear along the edge.I work for the usps so i had them order me another one. I though I just got a bad one. Well to my suprise the stiching on both sides riped at the first pocket.The green ends.This area nees to be beefed up. Thankyou.
5,Tool Pouch,I bought this tool pouch last month Jan 2011. I am a tech. Working for a large fire alarm company in Ma. I use my pouch everyday. It fits everything I need for my job. I tried finding one at homedepot and lowes. They didnt have the one i was looking for. Thanks amazon. Any questions about the pouch call me at 781-290-7348.
1,absolute crap,"As soon as i opened the packaging the on off button fell off - body was still attached to the packaging and I hadn't even touched it yet. I sent it back, could have been an outlier, but it felt cheap and I was not happy. Also the color is a bit fugly. I never used it so I can't comment on its usefulness, build quality was substandard."
2,Rechargable battery is the problem...,The rechargeable battery life is getting shorter and shorter quickly.
1,No longer a deal,I used to buy this formula in bulk when it was available because of the free shipping and the fact that it was frequently out of stock. It's a shame that the price has gone up. It's $3.00 cheaper at Costco.
1,Cheaper elsewhere,"Sam's Club and Costco offer this exact same product for around $29. I heard so much about this product being cheaper on Amazon, but it was unavailable for so long, and now that it is available it's more pricier than the club stores."
5,Convenient,I usually buy my formula @ Walmart. I hate driving anywhere with my 5 mth old boy so ordering online is a relief plus I've been searching for the cheapest enfamil. So far amazon.com is my choice. The free shipping justifies ordering online. Thanks.
1,the bottle leaks.,Don't buy this bottle. It leaks no matter how well you try to close it because the problem is at the nozzle. A small metal ball is designed to fit inside the nozzle to stop water flow but it doesn't and water drops constantly. I am going to contact Amazon for refund.
4,Great overview of the basics but not enough info,"Like all O'Reilly publications this book is concise and packed with info. I recommend this as a good basic primer for any of the MCSE subject tests. Do not, and I cannot emphasize this strongly enough, use this as your only resource. This book lacks many details, some which are trivial for actual NT operation but essential knowledge for passing the test. Use this to get an overview of the subject matter and then move on to one of the more detailed tomes available. Using this book as a starter will make the reading easier on the more complex books. I often found myself referring back to this book to clarify a confusing term or concept but by itself it was not enough."
1,Video Quality is TERRIBLE,"This was a promising documentary. I ordered and watched it and was completley dissapointed. The video quality is terrible, like some home video you would expect to see on you tube."
1,Horrible!,"Looks like the writer half-read the 2nd book, flipped through the 3rd and totally ingnored the 4th and 5th before writing this so called book."
4,Woolf's last novel,"Between the Acts (BtA) was Woolf's last novel, finished but not yet revised before her death in 1941. It is, like Woolf's other novels, experimental. She takes some of her already established techniques and adds new things. She sets it in the span of a single day (i.e. Mrs Dalloway), depicts and parodies historical events (i.e. Orlando). Woolf centers the action around a village play (a bad play, but that is part of the fun). The social commentary on Britain is there, but BtA is far from the ""usual British stuff."" In the course of the novel the reader should look at the actors and the audience, drawing parallels to our own daily acting. Woolf includes a number of literary allusions. See if you can find the use of Gerard Manley Hopkins in the narrative, for example. As with Woolf's other writings, plot is not the focus. Even though she died thinking it was unsuitable for publication (she was mistaken), BtA is a fine novel from a master writer."
3,another Proyas enjoyment....for the most part,"After seeing The Crow I had much loved respect for Proyas and then he did Dark City and I still did, but I was pretty mad at him for doing I, Robot because I hated that movie with a passion. Then I saw this one on the video shelves and I rented it and I liked it, to some extent. Rock stardom is always interesting, especially when they play. Some good performances (one in mind being Kick Gurry), but some come off as bland. Brett Stiller?? Any relation to Ben Stiller? Maybe? Who knows. Anyway, the slow motion stuff was interesting and kept me from steering away. Marton Csokas (costarred with Vin Diesel in Triple X) also stars as the head manager to Sprimp (nice band name). Highlight would be the dinner scene when their all hallucinating..funny s**t. Proyas pulls off another enjoyable movie...for the most part. This made up for I, Robot. My suggestion is dont go see the crappy I, Robot...rent this one."
1,for the visually impaired.,"This paper is thin, and the numbers are huge. I was excited when I saw this online but it looks cheaply printed on cheap paper. I will not be ordering this again."
3,An OK Book!,"This book was an OK book. One thing i didn't like about it was there was really no point to the book. This book had many different stories throughout the book. Some of the stories were good and some of them I didn't like too much, and some of them didn't make sense to me.The thing i liked about this book was hearing different stories that happened to them. My favorite thing about the book was the poems they wrote some of them had so many meanings to them, and other ones had a lot of discriptive detailed.I didn't like this book to much, but if you like hearing about peoples stories i think you will like this book a lot! The reasons why i didn't like this book is because it was slow,and some storie repeated, most of catagories contained the same story again and again. i didn't think that was too exciting. nothing too original."
4,good amount of stories shared,"I don't remember all the stories in here though I remember thinking that they could have included more than just north american culture though I think they tried to do it even more than the first book. The stories I remember liking are the ones about the dying grandmother who loved flowers, the one about the 13 year old surviving a motorcycle accident, the stepfather giving his depressed daughter a journal(which I feel is the best thing you can give anyone), the story about the girl who had to wear a wig after an accident, the one by jennifer love hewitt about the little boy with aids making a quilt, the one about the girl who was really depressed and when she got cancer she became much stronger after remission, and the one about the wedding dress china doll. They were very sweet and touching"
5,It was a great book!,The stories were so inspiring. It helped me understand things that had happened in my life. I recommend this book to young teenagers and older teenagers.
5,It Never Ceases To Amaze Me!!,"Being a fifteen-year-old myself, I absolutely loved the first book of the ""Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul"" series. I purchased the second edition thinking that it wouldn't be as good as the first one. WRONG!! In my opinion, these are two of the most inspirational books I've ever read. Please take my advice and read this book. It might not change your life, but it will leave you in awe. :)"
4,"Lovely, if hard.","This is a great edition for the masochist literature lover who wants to attempt middle english text. The footnotes are well researched and the supplementary papers are great additions.As to the actual story, it is a wonderful, if not a little too realistic, love story taking place during the Trojan war. It mixes Greek customs and period with Chaucer's life in the middle ages. The story confuses itself with middle age customs with ancient greek traditions, with some parts completely unable to be understood (as the footnotes can atest with the same difficulties).A good edition for English majors, bad for the faint of heart."
4,Good Book,Many photos of stunning real-life photos and explanations give you and entirely new look at human and animal bones on how they work.
4,Back Trails Guide,"This is a worthwhile book if you are looking for quad, jeep or hiking trails. It isn't as complete as I would have liked but it is worth the price."
1,A very poorly written book.,It is a waste of money and time to buy and to read this book. I mean the second edition. There is neither clear architecture concept nor technical detail. Many concept can be illustrated in a very simple drawings and the author will not do it. After I read other books I feel that the authors don't know what they are talking about.
5,God Went to Beauty School,I loved the book!!!! I boight it for a young a christian friend and one for myself. She ii going to cosmetology school and loves the book too.
1,This Book Is Just Plan Wrong!,I came across this book at a local library where it was in the age group for 3rd and 4th grade reading. I don't want to read this kind of garbage nor would I want a child to read it. I found it offense and do not recommend it for anyone. The writer needs to get a life!
3,Takes a strong wind,These chimes are lovely and make a soft pretty chime. However it takes alot of wind to get any sound at all.I'm going to keep them but I'm disappointed I can't enjoy their music more often.
1,Do not buy!,I bought this device because in the past we had a 9Volt that was really good. This device is not worth the price. I have had several different ones. This one runs at half the speed of the others. Even with a new battery. I would give it a negative if I could. Very disappointed.
2,Don't bother with this brand,"I ordered one of these buggers and noticed a couple of defects. 1- it was incredibly low powered and 2- there was no difference in power level from switch 4 to 5. Amazon was kind enough to send me a replacement. The new one is a bit more powerful, but I honestly think this brand is no good. I have ordered the tlc space vibe version many times and have never had an issue. Amazon, I hope you discontinue carrying this specific product. Your customers are trying to give you some good advice."
4,Movie is a winner for young kids,"This is an adorable movie my 5-year old daughter received for Christmas. She has watched it at least 10 times and has learned some new vocabulary words ""Radiant"" ""Salutations"". She was already in love with the story as we read the book first. To see the characters come to life was really fun for her."
4,Charlotte's Web (full screen edition),"Although this item was chosen as a gift, the recipients are thoroughly enjoying it. The parents saw it as children and are now viewing it with their children."
2,CD freezes a lot!!,It was not worth the money to get it and it was not worth the money to send it back... I was disapointed though...
4,this is rather pleasing.,"this is an old movie starring animated farm animals in which this little girl plays with wilbur the pig a lot.what she doesnt know is todays porkbelly pigpen playmate is tomorrows barbeque.the spider likes wilbur too,so she spins messages of praise to wilbur for all to see.everyone gets in a uproar over this fascinating phenomenon and they hope to save wilbur this way.kids like it but theres a dead charlotte at the end so the emotional ones will be in teers.it is very much consistent with the book.my 4th grade teacher read it to us.its good too.the author e.b. white also wrote the trumpets of the swan and stuart little also.the message here is dont hold onto nothing for too long.especialy a big fat farm pig filled with pork chops and bacon.mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmm."
1,Be warned,I downloaded this movie and it was NOT the one with Julia Robert and Dakota Fanning. It was the animated version of the movie.
4,CHARLOTTE SPINS HER TALE,"CHARLOTTE'S WEB is a family oriented and delightful adaptation of E.B. White's children's classic. A rare venture by the Hanna Barbera team into full length movies, the film benefits from its rich colorizations and cartoon-like drawings. We meet all the loveable characters: the runt Wilbur (Henry Gibson), the pig who enlists the spider's aid in avoiding the bacon farm; Charlotte herself (a winsome Debbie Reynolds), a spider who spins words into her web to ensure Wilbur's existence; the ravenous mouse Templeton (Paul Lynde), who becomes Charlotte's aide, in coming up with the right words; and countless others, including a dotty Agnes Moorehead as the triple speaking goose. The songs by Oscar winning Sherman Brothers (Mary Poppins) are banal and forgettable (with the exception of the lyrical ""Charlotte's Web), but they don't offend the viewer too badly. All in all, a delightfully entertaining film for the whole family to share."
2,Sadly Disappointed,"I had read glowing reviews about this book and was very eager to begin reading it. What a disappointment! The heroine is uninspired, the writing is abysmal, and the plot never seems to move anywhere. I love soap operas and couldn't wait for the ""juicy"" reveals about soaps that the book previews promised. Overall, I was incredibly bored by the novel. Let me illustrate it this way. I always read every page of every book before making up my mind about it. With this one, I stopped about a fourth of the way. Your time would be better spent watching an episode of ""All My Children."""
1,Stopped in 10 dots...,"I thought this book was horrible. I was reading it on Kindle, so I can't give you a pg number, but I stopped reading it around the 5th chapter. I don't usually give up on a book, but did with this one. This story was a bit of a autobiography and not very entertaining. For writing about one's self, the author did not give a good insight into her character. The book was hard to read because the author kept going in and out of script. Like I said earlier in this review, I just had to give it up. A waste of $9.99. The real disappointment was that I am a fan of Hughes the actress and was expecting more."
2,Curious examples,"Mr. Diamond has sifted through several millenia of human history, and the most relevant cases he can come up with are . . . Easter Island? Greenland? The Anasazi tribe? Were there no examples of larger societies available? Presumably, the bulk of his readership will be Americans, but it is difficult to understand how a nation of nearly 300 million people is supposed to draw conclusions from cases of tiny, remote societies going adrift. Had he developed his theories from an examination of, say, the fall of Rome, or of the Mongol Empire, they may have been more compelling. Any attempt to extrapolate findings from communities of 5,000 to nations of 300 million is going to be flawed."
3,Collapse,I was disappointed. Too long by several hundred pages. The problems are set out in the first chapter and could have been dealt with in couple hundred pages.The content is excellent but too long and redundant. I didn't find any suggestions for applying the examples to current problems. A livlier tone would have helped.
4,Think we have a society that will last?,"This is necessary reading for the thoughtful person who wonders just where we, and the society we live in, are going. Read about the way societies succeed, and fail, and think about all the similarities to other great empires that had no thought about ending. I wish this was required reading for All our goverment leaders.Read this, and wonder if, and when."
1,Boring,"This book cannot compare with with the author'sGuns, Germs and Steel- a five star book. The current book is brick-sized and deals with a number of historical collapses of human societies. I find the theoretical explanation lacking. It is clear that the author has his heart in the individual stories not the theorising"
4,The best non-fiction novel you'll read,"Collapse has the distinction of being a non-fiction book which is as exciting to the reader as his/her first time reading ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone."" Each case study is like a short story which holds the reader in suspense. Jared's conclusions are not initially obvious, but are supported by the evidence he presents. His case studies are diverse with regards to location, time period, and cause of collapse, and he does a good job of discussing the connections and similarities between them. As a scholar, my one criticism is that Diamond chose relatively isolated societies, and is unclear about how to extrapolate their lessons to a global scale. As a lifelong devourer of novels, I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good story or appreciates lifelong learning."
4,"""Collapse..."" by Jared Diamond is an interesting introduction","I have enjoyed ""Collapse"" as the first book that I have read on the subject. Jared Diamond's reconstruction of collapsed societies is very interesting although I have heard lately that it is not original. Garbage and feces are rarely subjects of interest but in this book they lead to important insights. Diamond discusses how various societies rise and fall with emphasis on causes such as climate change and, especially, destruction of the environment. Underlying his discussion is his debt to the Reverend Malthus who made the famous prediction that population would outstrip food supply. Clearly, this theory is validated over and over again.I gave the book 4 stars because it could have used better editing. There is some needless repetition and wordiness. However, I think that he offers a very interesting introduction to an important and timely subject."
3,"Thoroughly researched, but a boring read.","A thoroughly researched work, but one that could have been trimmed by at least 100 pages, if not more. I found myself skimming extensively, attempting to locate the more interesting passages.In my view, Diamond painted far too rosy a picture in his assessment of American society, neglecting to point out the very real possibility of a huge resource and/or financial collapse in the not too distant future."
3,Disappointing author,"The first 450 pages of this book are interesting (albeit repetitive), but after talking about all of the problems caused by overpopulation (especially by First World citizens) the author reveals that at age 50 (FIFTY!) he and his wife decided to start having children; wasteful, First World, resource-depleting children. What an ass."
1,Collapse: How Socities Choose to Fail or Succeed,"A great and timely theme. Unfortunately, supporting this theme with spurious, old, and disregarded data doesn't make the case. The result is that anyone half-way sophisticated enough to be familiar with the issues and up-to-date information will be at least unimpressed. The previous ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" was a good piece of work, at least from the purely materialist perspective, but this one will not make converts."
1,Pretty Basic,"There is a lot of the author's rantings about big business and mining in his state. His ranting went on for nearly 100 pages, then he goes on to talk about the fall of societies that were doomed from the start. I could have made the analysis that he made about the specific societies that he picked. Personally I was dissipointed that he did not get into idealistic reasons why some societies fail. I would have liked to see more about why very technilogically advanced societies failed throughout history."
1,Junk Science for the Simple Minded,"The best thing about this book is that Jared Diamond explains why there are no trees on Easter Island: the natives cut them down. What was it like, he asked, for those natives who cut down the last tree? Does Diamond really care? This book is for people who hate their neighbors, who supposedly hate materialism, and probably run around with ipods in their ears. I will nominate it for my annual Snooze-Book of the Year Award."
1,"Give me a break, PLEEEEEEEASE",Books Premise: Stop doing anything productive or fun otherwise you will have nothing less that the blood of Western Civilization on your hands. And for proof one need look no further than that all important region--the hey fields of Montana. Can someone please add an option of zero stars?!?
2,Disappointing,"This book was the most disappointing that I have read in years. I was a huge fan of Guns, Germs and Steel and The Third Chimpanzee but this book was definitely not up to the standard set by Diamond with those two.While the book is clearly very well researched, and thoroughly explores issues brought forward, it gets lost in Diamond's rhetoric and preaching about environmental measures that must be taken. At times I was sure that I was reading a book by Naomi Klein.Unfortunately, this book does not live up to previous titles by Diamond."
5,A book that rattles around in your brain after you've finished reading it,The best kind of nonfiction shares something in common with the best kind of fiction -- it grabs you and it won't let go. Jared Diamond gives you a new way to look at the world. I couldn't stop thinking about or talking about this book for weeks and even months afterward.
4,Another Jared Diamond grabber,"Jarrod Diamond has the unique ability to see populations and human history in a way that shows trends and common variables that help to determine the final outcome. Although not as compelling as ""Guns, Germs and Steel"", this is a great read and one that really gets you thinking."
5,Lo mejor de lo mejor,"Lo lei y tengo demasiadas ideas. Necesito escribir un analisis de algun simbolo que aparece en el libro por ejemplo, el gallo, el machismo, etc. Si alguien tiene informacion de algun simbolo hagamelo saber. Gracias... mi e-mail es ls0320@mail.ecu.edu"
3,Kind of small - This is not a toy,"I bought this cookie jar as a gift for my one daughter who is in love with anything ""Nightmare Before Christmas."" When I finally saw it on one of my visits, I was shocked to see how small it was. I am used to cookie jars being a lot rounder - at least big enough to fit in a couple of dozen home-made cookies in it. I think this one could only fit in, maybe, a bag of Oreos. It is beautifully made though with vivid colors and it is ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" so my daughter is in love with it. I bet her four kiddies wish it were a lot bigger though. LOL"
2,DECIEVING,"When i bought the book i had only the intention of learning directX. That's it. But after buying th book, i got stuck after the first example because it uses MFC and the Win32 API. It throughs you for a loop because it barely describes those concepts. This book is completely USELESS to me untill i learn the Win32 API. That wouldn't be a problem except that I DON'T WANT TO!!! Hope I was able to warn at least ONE person"
2,Chasing Ghosts from an Invented Past,"Hongo delights us with his poetic voice and I was expecting big things with this memoir. But doesn't a 'memoir' mean you've spent some meaningful time in a locale and are a bit of an expert on it? Hongo left Hawaii for California at a young age and knows little if anything about the history of the aina. His spiritual angle on looking at a leaf, stream, or hardened lava flow is somewhat interesting but the book lacks any meaningful punch because there is little or no characterization. I was expecting him to reconnect with people from his childhood but there are none. He is chasing ghosts from an invented past and the writing suffers for it."
3,Czech in Three Months: Less than ideal,"I write this with the perspective of someone who's learned several languages. The book is seriously flawed as a self-instruction course. Explanations as to the workings of grammatical points, such as hard and soft nouns, are incomplete; there are not enough practice dialogues; more vocabulary and grammar is introduced at the early stages than exercises with which to practice and reinforce what one has learned. From chapter 8 onwards things begin to look up, but I will be looking for another book to get myself up to the level required for chapter 8 of the Hugo book. At that point, I might return to the Hugo book, as it has a lovely sense of humor in the later dialogues, well worth learning for colloquial conversation."
5,Perfect!,"I needed a coat rack that wasn't traditional. This has clean lines and looks great. It was very easy to assemble. The wood looks great. It is a very functional, attractive piece that looks great in the entry way. Thumbs up to the designer. Shipping was very quick. I had the item within 3 business days. I would definitely recommend this item."
1,This book was awful!,I really don't understand how so many gave this book high reviews. IT was absolutely awful. THe ending was completely predicatble and Honoria was so incredibly annoying you wanted to reach into the book and strangle her.
5,Superb,My Mom picked this one up and I thought the story looked a little silly but we said we'd give it a try. Well-I love my Mom for this pick! Not only have I discovered a wonderful book but a series and author! I've read the entire series and my only question now is-why can't she write faster?!
5,"Great, Wonderful,HooooooooooooooooooT",Love all three of the Cynister Series could not wait till I gotnumber 2 & 3. I'll be the first in line to buy No.4. All threestories made my heart race and my husband can't wait till the nest one is out. You see he likes when I read these books beacuse I'm in a very good mood afterward. Thanks and keep writing and hurry with the next one.
5,Absolutely fabulous!,A murder is the beginning of this magnificent saga and the introduction of one of the best regency series: the Cynster family. Devil and Honoria are memorable and strong lead characters. Stephanie Laurens takes us masterfully to this wonderful place she has created. Unforgettable and simply fantastic!
5,book,I enjoyed this book very much and am reading the series.Would highly recommend to a friendLove theis time period.
4,Devil's Bride,"Gave it a four because liked the way the author held your interest, it was hard to put the book down, you wanted to continue reading to see what was going to happen next.Anybody who likes romance and adventure would like this book-"
2,Really disappointed,Felt like most of the book did not have much useful information. Would not recommend spending the money on this book.
3,It looks like the war is coming to an end.,This book is good for some information but time marches on leaving room for an updated version. It looks like the war is coming to an end and there will be some folks that would benefit from owning this book. If we had any real leadership in this country we could have already saved a trillion dollars and millions of peoples lives by not ever starting this stupid war to begin with. Truth be known; Cannabis is the cure for skin cancer.
5,Extremely Informative guide for every grower - novice to expert,I have read a score of publications on Cannabis Horticulture. NONE have even come close to providing the scope of useful detail that this book illustrates (Illustrates is the operative word). Everything one would ever need to know on the subject is detailed - and more!!I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ANYTHING BY MR CERVANTES
5,This book is a WINNER!,I recommend this book to not only your first time grower but to the seasoned grower also. This book is full of valuable information. I am pleased to add this book to my library. I would have to say that it would take 1 hell of a book to get my attention and this book did that end then some!Take Care and PeaceMarco RendaFounder of Treating Yourself.comPublisher & Editor of Treating Yourself Magazine
4,Crossword Puzzle Dictionary,"I love The NY Times Crossword Puzzle Dictionary, but, it isn't really a dictionary. It's a thesaurus which is what I wanted anyway. This is the second time I bought this book. The first book came apart with use. I'm afraid this one will, too, since it has so many pages and the spine isn't strong enough to hold them together. But, it is the best thesaurus you can find. Just handle it gently when thumbing through pages."
1,NY Times Crossword Dictionary,I wish I had not purchased this dictionary. It is totally useless. Not very well organized or categorized. The A-Z Dictionary is much better.
4,NY TimesX-word Puzzle Dictionary,"The best puzzle dictionary when it comes to States, Countries, and Nations. Easy to read. All State/Country information is highlighted for quick reference. Very inclusive. Recommended for the newer as well as the expert puzzle solver."
2,Crossword puzzle dictionary,"This book is difficult to use, and does not have enough entries. Is not useful for many crossword puzzles. Would not recommend for the average crossword puzzle."
4,Another copy,Thirs time weve bought this. A great resource for us seniors. Especially in a lightweight paperback form and flexible binding.
2,Somebody wake me when this thing is over.,"Dull, boring, uninteresting moodfest/snore-a-thon. Does for Westerns what ""2001"" did for Sci-fi. If you like movies for their artistic ""vision"" then by all means. But if you believe movies should be designed to entertain then you may want to take a pass on this overhyped turkey.Not even Warren Beatty can salvage this anti-movie. I'm sure Fellini would have liked it though. Just plain awful. 2 dogs."
1,Unhappy,When I opened the book the spine split in half and the pages loosened and fell out. I have yet to find a way to return the book. No one has responded to me.
2,onlinemommy,"I bought the Pistoulet dinnerware 5 years ago. Most of the pieces are chipped or scratched and I am planning to purchase Portmierion or Villroy to replace them all. If you like this look, save your money and shop for a similar pattern at Target."
4,pretty awesome =D,"I got my ipod for my birthday and I love it so much!!! I thought it would be so easy to fill up 4 GB because i am such a music freak!! haha....but it really isn't!!! The only problem I find in it is that it is really easily scratched and fingerprints show up really well on it... Also, you can't use it on both mac and windows if you've already formatted it to one or the other - that's a problem, but other wise it's great! So small and portable!"
3,yeesh,"I almost returned this item it took so much trouble to get it to work, I was about to give up. Apple support is web-only - unless you want to use your one -time phone call for support. Once it was up and running (took almost a week), the nano worked fine, but what a hassle - I can't recommend this simply because of the support issue."
3,clicker wheel feels like its made of paper,honestly i dont know which components they chose to put into this but solong as u dont mind replacing the clicker wheel you're golden.
2,"Beautiful piece of work, but not recommended for audio books!","I bought this item for its great looks, form factor and the Apple interface, but I've come to regret this choice as I primarily listen to audio books with this device. My primary issues with using this device for audio books are:-1- Doesn't support DRM-protected Windows Media Audio (WMA) files!! That precludes me from downloading Overdrive books from my local library. Most devices at this price point support this feature and I wish Apple would too.-2- I loose my bookmark whenever the unit is recharged (really inconvenient for books!!).-3- I only get ~5 hrs of runtime between charges.Also, the 'click-shift' mechanism for selecting files is hard to work with, and there have been a few technical glitches whereby all content on the iPod spuriously vanished."
3,4 GB Nano iPod White,"Overall a neat product but not as good as other MP3 players. It is great to have 4GB of portable music... Frustrating is that the battery discharges easily even if the iPod is not used. It is not possible to manage files, i.e. delete on the iPod itself whereas other MP3 players offer that flexibility."
3,Not as much backroads as the titles suggests,"I bought this video in the hopes of learning about the little secrets of the region,places like Castellaine, Gorges du Verdon, etc.However, the video sticks to the beaten track of Nice - Cannes - St Tropez with a bit of Grasse, Biot and others. Nothing special, no real backroads!Not for the usual traveller to the region. It's OK if you're planning to go for the first time, but I guess there must be better guides."
1,Poor tree!!,"Much of the content and context is in SAPs on-line help files. The title is quite misleading... buyers beware!I looked at some of the other books in this series, as well, and had a similar reaction.The majority of people want configuration information, not a re-worded version of the help files. R/3 is about configuration, configuration and configuration!!"
2,Don't judge a book by it's cover.,"The title on the front cover promises much, but the book fails to deliver. The book implies in the title by mentioning (""administering"") that areas of configuration will be covered. It is not, it is just an overview of functionality.Most of the content of this book is freely available in the SAP on-line help.If you have the on-line help then don't bother buying the book.If you don't have the on-line help, then this book provides a good overview, just don't expect anything indepth.Authors/ Publishers please note: I, like every other SAP configurer have access to the on-line help. It covers nearly everything in terms of functionality overview (and it's free!) The real gap in the book market is in terms of SAP configuration/ module integration and problems/ solutions therein."
1,A waste of money & time,I'm very dissapointed with this book. It does not deliver what it should. All are explained very briefly & i think R/3 help is way much helpful than this book .
5,wiadom,this was a needed book for my class.. thank ytou. it aarrive in time for class. great book wii enjoy.
4,Really interesting plot.,"This was the first of Cresswell's books that I actually liked. The plot is interesting especially in light of today's terrorist activities and it's well crafted and rolls at a good pace. However, the main characters fall in love without much pretext. Yes, they've known each other for a long time and yes, they've kissed and noticed an attraction, but they go from finally getting together after three years of avoidance to a hastily crafted sex scene. I didn't feel much of a connection to Verity once she became sober. Michael had about as much emotion as a stick. The use of a ghost works when he first appears, but then it becomes obvious that he's just there to shove the book along. You read his words and think - oh, please, give me a break. At times the dialogue was stilted and strained and there was a great deal of 'telling' and narration that slowed it down. But all in all, thanks to the interesting plot, it was a good read."
5,"Good imagination, bad omen.",Reading this story after 9/11 makes you believe that this kind of standoff could happen. But also make you thing how short the imagination of a person could be compared with reality. In the other hand as you can see in the reviews before 9/11/2001 people didn't believe this story as real.The book is a little heavy in some parts but you won't be able to put it down till you finish it. In the book we can see JC's good imagination but very bad omen.

4,The Outlaw of Gor,"A good read for fans of John Norman and his protagonist, Tarl Cabot. Altough Mr. Norman is sometimes given to overly-detailed technical descriptions and the occasional bit of turgid prose, this is a fine read for those interested in the World of Gor and provides more insight into the mind and make-up of Tarl Cabot and of the customs, history, and people of Counter-Earth.I strongly recommend it for those who enjoyed the first novel in the Gorean saga, ""The Tarnsman of Gor."" I enjoyed this book as much as the first novel."
5,perfect crate for my ShiTzu 8 pounds,My ShiTzu outgrew her smaller training crate and she had 3 puppies in June. I then got her a playpen and it was nice to separate her from the puppies when they were 6 weeks old. She only sleeps in crate at night as she was cage trained. She weighs 8 pounds and this crate is the perfect size for her with plenty room for her to turn around in it. Taking her to the Vet and traveling is so much easier also.
3,Passable book -- Barely,"This book, like NW5 Admin. and Design, does manage to covermost of the material on the two tests. However, there are severalnoticeable errors (confusing typos, mislabelled diagrams) in the first edition, so be careful. The book also tends to focus on subject material differently than the tests covered. So, if you are using this book as a primary source, you may want to supplement it with something else, especially if you want good practice questions. The practice questions offered with this book leave a lot to be desired."
5,BOOK PURCHASE,ORDERED THIS BOOK FORMY DAUGHTERS ENGLISH CLASSTHE BOOKS CONDITION WAS GREATCAME PRETTY FASTWOULD BUY HERE AGAIN
2,It had it's good moments,"I'm not sure what to say about this book, I THINK i liked it... it's about a woman who wants to start out somewhere new, and on the way she gets a daughter and meets people... I wish turtle had said more... Barbara seems to ramble on and on... I'm not even sure if i would recommend it... I THINK i would..."
2,meh,this book was not bad. this book was not good. this book wasnt really anything except time consuming. i would not recommend this most people. a mediocre book by a mediocre author.
4,The book gave me great strength,"I was told to read this book in my english class which made me really mad. But, the moment I picked up the book it was no keeping down this book changed my life it bought tears to my eyes it gave me a light heart when I read about the life of taylor it gave me an insight of all the people who go through various hardships rather than giving up. I recommend that everyone should read this book."
3,bean tree,The bean tree was not so good in the begain but by the end i was very intested in the book. the book was about good but there was spots it could be better. it was about this girl(taylor) and see should people that she was differnt then the rest. thought her experenses i learnd alot. i have seen others reviews and i agree with them. the book was alot more intersting at the end because the chacters came out more and showed there real self. many peopele believe this book was ok because of the begain of the book. but most say the same that i do the end was great and made the book one that you'd like to read. taylor was a great main chacter because she had hard times and had to overcaming things but then over came them and became a better person.
4,A great novel by Kingsolver,"This book was very interesting. It constantly brings up the death-rebirth-life cycle, and reminds the reader that one cannot grow up without someone to care for. It was interesting because the unexpected seemed to happen. I don't really want to tell more to give it away, but it was an excellent book. I had to read this for my English II Honors class at my school, and some students, didn't like it, mostly because they dislike books that they are pretty much 'forced' to read. But if you were to just say 'I'm going to read a book to day' out of the blue, pick this one, it's relatively short, I read it in a few hours, and it's satisfying to the mind."
4,Different story line and a varied side of life,Very well written like all of Kingsolver's books. I like the people doing what people should and not what the world expects of them just because there are guidelines which don't necessarily fit everyone.
2,Wasn't a great book,I read this book for a book club and I didn't think it was that great. First of all the beginning was kind of slow. It started to get interesting by the end of the book but it wouldn't be a book I would recommend. Maybe I need to read it again since a lot of the club members enjoyed this book. Anyways wouldn't read it again.
2,The Bean Trees,"Taylor Greer encounters many obstacles in her journey headed to nowhere. She leaves her hometown looking to start a new, when a lady puts a child in the front seat of her Volkswagen and walks off. Taylor has no choice, but to take care of the child at least for a little while. But Taylor ends up loving the child more and more each day. Along her journey she meets many interesting people; Maggie- a woman that fixes cars for a living , Lou Ann- an overprotective mother and Mrs. Parsons- an old, blind woman that babysits small children. Taylor picks up a few jobs here and there, until she meets Lou Ann and moves in with her. Taylor's mission in this book is to find the child's relative's, but she never does. That's why I gave it two stars. I don't really like how the book ends, because it leaves you wondering. This book is slow paced and easy to read, if your looking for something simple it's nice."
3,Okay-But a Bit Strange in Characters!,"I was able to get through this book okay, but found it a little boring. It jumped around a lot.Taylor Greer is an eighteen year old girl striving for independence in her life. She also wants to cut the strings with her boyfriend to avoid pregnancy.In her travels from her hometown of Kentucky, she meets the human condition head-on when a baby is placed in her car. The mother takes off and leaves. So Taylor has no choice but to love it and calls her Turtle for the way she grabs onto things.As the book continues, other strange characters enter the scene, and the story line skips around quite a bit. This is what I didn't like about the story as a whole; otherwise it would have been good."
3,ok....,"It was a pretty good book, but I think it needed some more action to it like all of the middle is incredibly prolonged and really boring but the begning and end are good. I would read this book once but probably never agian. It is worth reading though."
3,It could be better...,"This book was a little bit boring. It seemed like it had no plot. I read the first couple of chapters and got sleepy..zzz.. If your into books about indians it would be good.If your into interesting books, read something else."
1,I wish I could give it less than 1 star.,"This book is about nothing. There is no point, or whatever little there is of it is very well hidden in the nonsense. I bought it based on the good reviews on Amazon, thinking that 300+ reviews could not be wrong. Bad mistake.Waste of time and money."
3,The Bean Trees,"THE BEANS WRITNG BY BARBARA KINGSOLVER WAS A VERY WELL DEVELOPED BOOK. IT STARTS OFF ABOUT A YOUNG GIRL IN HER MID 20'S AND HER QUEST FOR A NEW LIFE. WELL SHE IS ON THIS QUEST FOR A NEW LIFE. SHE HAS TO OVERCOME CERTIAN OBSTACLES INORDER FOR HER TO ADVANCE ANY FUTHER. SHE ENDS UP WITH RESPONSIBILITIES SHE DOES NOT WANT TO HAVE, BUT SHE KNOWS THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS TO COMPLETE THEM. ON THE ADVANTURE SHE MEETS NEW PEOPLE AND THEY BECAME HER BEST AND CLOSES FRIENDS.WHEN BEFORE SHE HAD PROBLEMS KEEPING THINGS IN HER LIVES NOW SHE DOESNT HAVE THAT PROBLEM ANYMORE. SHE HAS TO LET GO OF ONE OF THE THINGS SHE LOVES THE MOST WHEN SHE JUST GOT IT A BABY GIRL NAMED TURTLE SHE HAD HER FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS. IN THE END SHE LERNED TO KEEP FRIENDS AND TO NEVER GIVE UP ON WHAT SHE WANTS OR BELIEVES IN. SHE ENDS UP LIVING WITH HER NEW AND YET OLD FRIEND MS.MADDIE AND SHE ENDS UP LIVEING WITH HER."
5,One of the most enjoyable books ever read!,"The author captures your heart with this warm, endearing story. It took me only two days to finish reading as I did not want to put it down! You fall madly in love with all the characters! I recommend it along with all her other books!"
3,Not Bad,"I was assigned this book in my college English class. It takes a few chapters to get into the story, but it gets better and overall it's a pretty good book. I'm anxious to read the sequel Pigs In Heaven, just to see what happens to Turtle."
3,"Snappy Dialogue, Well Written, but Not Much Plot","Bean Trees was Barbara Kingsolver's first novel. It is well written with dialogue that is perfect for the characters portrayed. I enjoyed the snappy repartee and colloquialisms; they reminded me of some of my grandmother's sayings. The characters are rich and memorable. However, with that said, there just isn't enough of either the dialogue or characters to carry the story. The plot is very thin.There is certainly a slight agenda with this book, but the way it is written into the story allows for it without it becoming the story itself.I have also read Animal Dreams and I know that Kingsolver gets better as her writings continued. I will continue to read more or her works."
3,The Bean Tree Review,"Randy The Reviewer:It's all about a girl named Taylor. She leaves her hometown in Kentucky.Leaving because she wants a better life. She leaves in a 1955 Volkswagen. Ending up in Tucson ,Arizona.On the way she ends up with a indian girl named Turtle.Taylor ended up adopting and then almost taken away by the state in Arizona.She gave up and gave custody to her best friends that had a good relationship with Turtle.Turtle was from the Cherokee nation in Oklahoma and taken back to try to find Turtles parents. In Tucson she gets settled in a apartment.later on she looses her relationship with Turtle and Taylors friends. This book is realy sad at some times.I think this is a good book baecause There is text that makes you to want to read further into the book. This is a good fiction book."
2,This book was as mediocre as my efforts in school,"This book belongs in the fireplace of Mr. Beaty. Though no flames come out, it's the thought that matters. This book is horrid. It lacks literary value. Any hidden meanings must have been merely coincidental, considering the probable intellect of the author. It's rather unfortunate that it somehow worked its way into the curriculum of some schools. It's sad to think that impressionable students are forced into reading and assessing this book by people that probably thought it was wonderful. I highly anti-suggest this book."
4,Bean Trees and Rhizobia,"Barbara Kingsolver writes a touching story about an abandoned and abused Indian girl who finds a mother in a young Kentucky native named Taylor. A tale that descriptively depicts the hardships of a young mother and her struggle to connect with the daughter. The author does an incredible job of piecing together the story with ingenious themes and symbols. It is a novel to remember for its wonderful descriptions and genuine emotion. Through sacrifices and love, Taylor is able to nurture Turtle into a lively child that is like a bean tree with rhizobia. As Taylor says ""The wisteria vines on their own would just barely get by, but put them together with rhizobia and they make miracles"" (228)"
4,A Very Enjoyable Read,"The Bean Trees was a good quick read. I enjoyed the development of the characters and was pulled in by the narrative style of the main character Taylor. I didn't find any life altering philosophy, but there were little pearls of wit and wisdom with an overall tenacious quality. For another interesting read, I would recommend the negative reviews included on this site. Though there are well spoken people with interesting observations, there also seem to be some disgruntled English students out there, who amidst variable levels of grammatical competency have vented their frustrations. I give them 5 stars for their priceless commentary, insight, and flashbacks to a time when reading was coerced."
1,Inappropriate for high school English classes,"Unfortunately this book is being promoted by high school teachers as part of their English curriculum. The language used in this book should have no part in a study of English literature. In most high schools the language used in this book would result in reprimands or even expulsion if used by the students. Parents, inform yourselves before condoning the sudy of vulgarity in your high school by allowing this book to be studied in the high school classroom. It's inappropriate."
1,Stop! Stop! I'm already dead....,"It has been 3 long years since I read Barbara Kingsolver's ""The Bean Trees"", and to this very day, I still feel completely violated in the worst possible way. This book was an utter nightmare, and I'm pretty sure Kingsolver is an avatar of the Dark Lord we call Satan. Seriously, this book made me wish I had never been born, and only by jabbing my eyes out with a moldy chopstick did I keep myself from drifting off into a coma. Sometimes, I'd be in my bed, trying to go to sleep... and that's when I feel the dark shadowy presence of Turtle, just watching me, breathing heavily. The ramifications of Kingsolver and her atrocity in my life are indescribable. STAY AT LEAST 30 FEET AWAY FROM THIS BOOK AT ALL TIMES! Run for the hills! RUN!!!!!!!!"
1,"If I were stranded on a desert island,","and I could take 5 books, 5 albums, and 5 movies, I'd probably die of exposure. If I took the bean trees, however, at least i'd have something to start fire with. This could possibly be the worst book ever written. It is easy to read, because the author doesn't try to hard to challenge the readers mind. It is a boring, unrealistic book about a girl's journey across the country. The fact that i'm of the male persuasion may taint my view of the book, but I'm allowed to have an opinion, and also maintain the right to spread it everywhere I go."
1,"Asimple REVIEW of us, ROger Ling, RAymond Gao,& Jonathan Bau","Dear Friends, WE have read this book, and other reviews, and WE have made a conclusion for myself. This book is a visionary, it leaves you open mouthed and sleeping (drooling too.)... although it seems to contain good topics such as friendship and love in the book, it is SO scrambled that the book turns into a jumbling piece of literature. The book contains random events that have nothing to do with each other, yet somehow Barbara Kingsolver uses extremely bad writing and a strong Tucson accent to tie all the events together. All in all, WE,Roger Ling, RAymond Gao, and Jonathan Bau appreciate the hard effort that Kingsolver put into this ""interestingly unique"" book, but next time she wants to write another book alike this one, we shall say, ""Thanks, but no thanks. Think of the future generations."" P.S. WE were unable to finish the book due to the book's lack of quality."
5,An intensely wonderful book,"Barbara has done it again she is one of the few writers that can be described as barrierless in the sense that its not easy to tell her colour,age or status from her writing.with this book she has not been any different a trully great writer"
