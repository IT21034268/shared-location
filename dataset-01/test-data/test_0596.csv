2,I said I'd given up on Clancy . . . I say it again,"I've been a Clancy fan from the beginning, but over time the page count kept rising while the interesting insight declined. However, with the Teeth of the Tiger, the new idea of introducing Ryan's son and the vastly reduced page count made me give him one more try.Mistake.The story line is bland, turning the joy of ""Hunt"" and ""Red Storm"" into work. While there are a few classic Clancy action sequences that give the story some zip, the story never builds any enthusiasm for Ryan's son. The references to old Ryan friends as mentors are weak. However, the real death blow is the rediculous coincidence that sets up the main plot. Somehow I made it through the rest, but I'm going back to non-fiction and Simon Winchester."
1,What happened to Clancy?,"I've read every thing Clancy has written. I've loved everything that Clancy has written. Whether it's 700 or 1000 pages I blaze through his books hanging on every word, but Teeth of the Tiger is horrible.It's slow. He repeats himself. After reading half way into the book the plot is very predictable. He tries to cover the lack of plot with detailed descriptions of everything from the mundane to the cuisine of Vienna but the last 100 pages were as slow as the first 100 pages.I rarely hate a book. I've never finished a book this bad."
1,Save your money. One of Clancy's worst.,"The book draaaaaaaags on and on and on and on. The plot is thin and the entire book lacks the usual Clancy spark present in most of his previous adventures. The ending really leaves you hanging with no definite conclusion. The plot is plausible, although, in reality, political assassinations have been happening for hundreds, if not thousands, of years, so this story is nothing new.Save your money on this one. Its definitely not worth it."
3,Half his usual,"The book is half as long as normal, but is unfinished. Obviously the beginning of a new series, the author has solved the Jack Ryan problem. Having promoted his original hero out of the action, here the heroes are the son and nephews of the original. But these kids are without depth or much of a back story. Jack Jr., a rich, spoiled?, college grad with no experience talks himself onto a top secret job and assasination. Huh?The author would still benefit from editing (three descriptions of death by poison), but still knows how to make a reader turn the page. The kids need more seasoning and where are all the old guys? Finish this one."
2,Nothing to say but paid to keep talking,"I've gotten this impression from many of what used to be my favorite writers. John Grisham, Larry McMurtry and especially Tom Clancy. They've said everything that needs to be said, but people keep paying them huge sums to keep talking. The result is substandard efforts from all of the above. After all, how many different iterations of geopolitical intrigue can you churn out before you start repeating yourself."
3,Not bad,"But The Teeth Of The Tiger could of been better. What Clancy is trying to do is trying to come back from The Bear And The Dragon and Red Rabbit from how terrible they truly are.He knows that Jack is getting old, and so he brings along Jack Jr. and his cousins Dominic and Brian. One thing: Brian and Dominic are boring charatchers, and Jack Jr. is boring himself!Clancy tries to bring back Jack Jr. as the new generation of hero's, but what ever happen to Ding? Clancy should of brought back Ding and bring him to action instead of Brian and Dominic.Well it is sad to see that Clancy is just writing for money now, and not just for the sake of his fans. Also Clancy, if u r reading this, read more novels instead of history books."
1,WHAT IS GOING ON WITH CLANCY?,"I am so glad I checked this out from the library rather than buy a copy. I won't bother to go into the details of the ""plot"" or ""characters"" because other reviewers have given you enough. The last Clancy novel I read was ""Cybernation"" back in 2002. It was actually written by a ghost-writer, and the plot was a joke. I decided to give Clancy one more try for plane flights from Oregon to Georgia. A mistake. Mr. Clancy, please, please, get your attorney to get you out of your book contract. You are disrespecting your readers and you don't need the money. I liked your first books a lot."
2,Mediocre,"I have read all of Clancy's books both fiction and non fiction. The past few have become more predictable and less entertaining. This latest work seems like it was done with minimal thought or effort. We have the usual tired internal thoughts of Jack Ryan (jr now) about religion, sex and politics that reflect Clancy's own views. We must also suffer through Clancy's constant swooning over the medical profession's dedication, humanitarianism and god like powers.It's a formula that has been getting old for a while. My advice is to buy this one used if you must have it."
1,Painful reading again...,First I would like to say that the US special forces are far more efficient in books than in the real life.The second point is that nobody can believe a story like that. How can you imagine that the CIA operatives who are trained night and day during months can be replaced 'on the fly' by some obscure marine and fbi rookies after a few weeks of self training and that the best intelligence analyst would be the president's son without any training at all. Come on mr Clancy... be serious.
1,Awful,"Rarely comment here on books I read, but having read this......I've read all the Clancy books, and this is just awful.I have no problems with Clancy getting away from Ryanverse as they call it, but this reads exactly like his Ops Center series....simple, boring, and like the plot was done by some sort of 'write a thriller novel' rules to follow.He should be ashamed of this book."
1,It's just bad,"I've been a fan of Mr. Clancy's books for years, but I'm sorry to say that this book just sucks. From top to bottom, this was just a bad story. Jack Jr. is annoying and can't seem to stop talking about or thinking about his famous dad, and all the other characters were so boring and two dimensional that I can't even remember their names. I have to admit, I stopped reading the book with about 50 pages to go because I just couldn't bear the thought of spending another second reading it. I hate to give such a bad review but really, save yourself the pain and don't read this novel. If anything read (or reread) one of his classics (Sum of All Fears, Debt of Honor)."
2,I so wanted to like this book! (but didn't),"I tried, I really did. Like most reviewers, I'm a long-time Clancy fan, so I was anxiously hoping Teeth of the Tiger would be the book that turns around the slump Clancy seems to be in. Unfortunately, it was not to be.The characters are two-dimensional at best, the plotting is lazy, and the writing is tedious and numbing. I'm just flabbergasted this is the same author that put out some of my favorite books: Red Storm Rising, Hunt for Red October, Debt of Honor... Teeth of the Tiger not only feels like it was phoned in by Mr. Clancy, but it was done so on a line with a bad connection.I MAY give Clancy one more chance, but I think I'll try a library copy before I spend the money. My advice: Try Grant Blackwood (The End of Enemies, The Wall of Night, An Echo of War). I've officially put Blackwood ahead of Clancy on my ""must read"" list."
1,Paper Tiger is more like it....,"As a huge Clancy fan, I've been disappointed - again. Since the last true Clancy book, Rainbow 6, Clancy just hasn't had it going on.From it's hugely implausible ending - that you saw coming a mile away, to his repeated use of phrases (""Patience is something that takes time to learn"" or drivel to that effect), to the total lack of suspense and drama, this paper tiger has no teeth.Tom, go back to your old books and read how you used to grab us by the throat and never let us go.To everyone else, spend your money on something more suspenseful, like a Cat In The Hat book..."
2,very disappointing,When i buy Tom Clancey i expect excitement and action. This book is boring and slow. Is tom getting old?
4,Love Tom Clancy,"I dont think it really furthers my life lessons or learning, but better than watching TV hands down!"
3,Interesting Thoughts,"The premise of the novel is an interesting concept. I will not go into any detail on it as that is of course part of the story.However, throughout the story there are too many coincidences for reality. Additionally the first half of the book is rather slow after the beginning bit.Later on, the action picks up some, but is generally underwhelming.Although an intersting thought on possibility of terrorism and counter-terrorism, the novel falls short of the expectations in suspence, action, and plot."
2,Who Wrote This Book???,"Are you kidding me? Did Tom Clancy really write this book? This book has got the thinnest plot I have read in some time. What happened to Clancy? He might have written this book over a weekend because it shows very little effort. There is none of the character development that I have become accustomed to. In terms of plot, it's about as deep as a poorly produced, direct-to-video action flick. If you have never read Clancy, you definitely want to start with one of his first novels. If you're a Clancy fan, you will be sorely disappointed with this lackluster effort."
1,I'm 12 and I know better,"I have read all of Tom Clancy's books, and this is the worst. I'm 12 years old and I love the Ryan story line and all the military stuff, but this is really bad. His best books were Hunt for Red October and Patriot Games if you ask me. Don't waste your allowance on this crap."
2,Are all Tom Clancy characers born in 1947?,"Tom Clancy's characters, no matter what age portrayed in his novels, seem like they were born in 1947. Dominic and Brian Caruso make comments such as, ""She has legs like Betty Grable.""Betty Grable? A young Marine such as Captain Caruso would be more apt to say, ""She has legs like Jessica Simpson,"" or more probably, ""She has a butt like J-Lo."" Also, what's this about Caruso driving a Hummer? On the salary of an O-3? Gee Tom, do you really think a young Marine officer can afford a hummer? Do you think he would want to drive one after being in the real thing (Humvee) in Iraq and Afghanistan? I work at Camp Pendleton and I have never seen an active duty Marine driving a Hummer. Hmm, I wonder what Tom Clancy drives. Hey, come to think of it, Tom Clancy was born in 1947! Hey Tom, better go out in the field with some young Marines for a few weeks before you portray them in your next novel."
2,Disappointing...,"""Teeth of the Tiger"" was not among Clancy's better works. I have read them all, I was happy to be back in Jack Ryan's world (sort of), but I can't help thinking Clancy outlined the book, maybe sketched it out some and started it, and then handed it off to someone else to finish. Half the plot is left hanging. The way the final climax is handled would have had the Mossad knocking on the Company's door in less than a week. Also, the narrative in the book gets a little cruder and more explicit than is(was) characteristic of Clancy. This is understandable when the 'bad guys' are involved, but not pervasive throughout the book--even in descriptive narrative. It just isn't Clancy. Oh well, anything to make a buck."
2,I'm glad I borrowed this from the library!,"I kept waiting for the climax and conflict that never came. Was Jack, Jr. going to be recognized in public? Was his daddy gonna figure out what was going on and foil Jr's plans (and why didn't daddy figure this out?) Were the twins going to make an error? Was someone going to overhear their non-discrete conversations?I can't resist picking up and immersing myself in Clancy books (especially JRyan ones), but this one just left me unsatisfied (and glad that I didn't spend the money to buy it!)If you like ending books thinking ""That's it?"", then check it out."
3,"Good intro, but lacks excitement","This is a novel introducing a new Jack Ryan series, this time featuring Jack Jr. It's decent at introducing the characters for a new series and introducing Jack Jr. to the business of being a spy, but tends to drag a bit. Lacks the excitement of Mr. Clancy's other novels, and leaves a lot of blanks about the period between his father's presidency and the time during which the new story is to take place. I would hope that Mr. Clancy has some direction to where this is going and will be able to 1. fill in the blanks, and 2. introduce some real action and adventure. It is obvious that this book is meant to have sequels."
2,Diminishing Returns,"""Hunt for Red October"" was brilliant - a well-researched, taunt tour de force! ""Sum of All Fears"" was as good as the movie made from it was bad. And now ""The Teeth of the Tiger""... Half as many words as Clancy's previous novels, and only a tenth of his previous inspiration. The book seems forced, drifts along with a really implausible plot, and is populated with two-dimensional, cartoon-like characters. I was shocked at the facile plot device in the middle of the book - I was literally shouting at the author while reading: ""This is beneath you!"" No one can be good all the time - but this one just seems to be ground out as the obligatory next installment. Reread one of the jewels above instead of spending your money on this turkey."
4,this book is good,"this book is good, why doesn't anyone else think so? i dont know maybe its cause i havent read any other tom clancy books, but i thought this book had a good plot and good action."
4,Best Clancy is some time!,"While this book is certainly not on par with some of the great Clancy works like Debt of Honor, it sure beats the long, drawn out novels that were The Bear and the Dragon and Red Rabbit.The book is, in my mind, fast-paced though the last 100 or so pages turns quite repetitive. I enjoyed being introduced to the new characters though, as some reviewers have mentioned, the dialogue is sometimes ridiculous. Perhaps one reason for many of the low reviews is the fact that we are introduced to new characters. The familiar Ryan, Foley, Clark, Chavez, etc. are completely absent. After a dozen or so novels, maybe some are just resistant to the idea of something new.I liked the book. It is the best since Rainbox Six and an enjoyable read."
2,very slow and defies belief,"OK, does this make sense - Jack Ryan's twin nephews and his son coincidentally get recruited to take on terrorists? The book plods along and assualts us with moralizing lectures. I really wanted to like this book but it falied to engage me. The premise is great and we all want to cheer on the hard working intelligence agency folks who unravel the myriad detail they collect but give me a break - three novices from the same ""royal"" family end up leading the charge?"
2,Better than Red Rabbit but not by much,"not very realistic,comic book characters, plot is sketchy,and this book is just the prelude for a sequel. I wont't bore you with the plot; suffice to say the dust jacket is the book. With this book Clancy is continuing to show that he is past his prime and his books are lacking imagination. Wait for the paperback version."
2,A disappointed Clancy fan,"This book just doesn't measure up! The main characters are poorly developed and have a shallow sort of feel to them (I found myself thinking, ""Where the heck are the guys like Clark and Chavez?""), and some of the ""old"" characters from previous books are summarily dismissed or unconvincingly written out of the story. I began wondering if Mr. Clancy had difficulty meeting a deadline with this one . . .I normally read a Clancy novel in a day, just because I can't put it down. I read this one in a day too--but only to finish it and get on to something more interesting.An additional problem was the number of grammatical errors in this book. Perhaps a new editor would help?"
1,A Feat of Endurance,"I was hoping that Clancy would rebound from whatever funk he fell into with Red Rabbit, getting back to the present timeline with Teeth of the Tiger. Unfortunately, The Teeth of the Tiger is plagued by too many references to the Jack Ryan mythology, too much exposition, and not enough of a reward plotwise. By far, this is the thinnest plot of any Clancy novel, and getting through the 431 pages felt like a feat of endurance."
2,Missed the goal of less tedium,"YES Tom - we get that a cross country road trip is tedious. YES Tom - we get that intelligence work is tedious. We don't have to experience it for ourselves.The book started off well enough and the concept is interesting. But, quickly the book bogged down into 200+ pages of bad dialog and whining about the above mentioned topic.While much better than Red Rabbit, this book is still far worse than any of his books prior that."
1,Not what I was looking for,"Decent book, but I was looking for something a bit more creative with fund-raising ideas. This was more about setting up a fund-raising structure. Didn't help me at all."
3,"I thought it was cute, then it broke","I thought this was really cute, but then it broke the first time I wore it (it may have somethin gto do with my baby grabing it, but I don't think he had a chance to pull very hard). Not very happy. For some reason I can't change the star rating, but I'd give it one start now."
5,sandy and billy joe,"i wish sandy posey and billy joe royal would do an album [cd] of duets together.they both have so much talent,it is a shame not to put those two together.they are both multi-talented,and if some company would really push it,it would go gold.go for it.-----richard -south georgia."
5,Fantastic Source,I just received my map and it's jam packed with information all in one place. It's organized very well and has very current information. It's easy to read and much easier to carry around rather than a book. I have not taken my trip to Cancun yet but have made many plans based on the information provided in this map. I highly suggest anyone going to Cancun get this map.
5,Life-changing revelation!,"If you desire more in your walk with God, if you are hungry for more understanding about the Holy Spirit (the third person of the Trinity), if you want what Jesus said He would send us all as believers, if you want to live victoriously, if you want to be free from spiritual bondages; this book will give you clear explanations and examples of how the Holy Spirit works in the lives of women and men around the world and how He can work in and through you too. This book was utterly moving. I found myself crying (on the subway!) tears of joy while reading the powerful examples of women who triumphed, and I craved more and more this same victory in my own life...not just for me, but so that I can pray for the victory of others."
5,Gorilla lug nuts- 76197 XL,"These have been on my '90 F-250 for about 8 months and they look as good as new at this point. With the deal I got through Amazon these were cheaper than the plain lug nuts at my local auto stores, plus they look cool."
4,"KitchenAid KHM900PK 9-Speed Hand Mixer, Komen Pink","Pros: Many speeds, easy to use, strong motor, small, easy to carryCons: It's pink"
4,Instant Shine,Great product. Easy to apply and was shipped quickly after placing the order. Put a great shine on my bike
3,cool cool,"i like eek hes cool but i think hes past his prime, most of the good songs on this cd are all of his older stuff anyways. Hes a good artist but i think he is suffering from over exposure but the cd is pretty good i guess"
2,"Not consumable, tons of phonics rules","I bought this book to help teach phonics to my four-year-old son. When I received it, I found out that it's not a book of consumable worksheets like I thought it was going to be. It's full of phonics rules. There are a few consumable activities here and there. But don't buy this book if you're looking for consumable worksheets to use with your child. Do buy it if you want to teach your child the ""hows"" and ""whys"" - the rules - of phonics."
1,disappointed,I was very disappointed with this product first it was a bait and switch and then when I returned the product they received it but did not issue a refund until I call. So I don't think I will be buying anything in the near future. My son was really looking forward to having spiderman reversable comforter with venom on the other side but that is not what was sent.
5,Orchestral Music is a must!,"The fourth edition of Daniels' handbook is a must for anyone involved in selecting repertoire for the symphony orchestra. The appendices are extremely helpful, the precise instrumentation for percussion and auxilary instruments is valuable, and the listing of nationality, birth/death dates and places for the composers is useful. This handbook is truly a time-saving and informative reference work."
5,5 stars,"Classic Ella - great 2 CD set - have so many of her music and there are some repeats, but also some hard to find songs"
1,Ridiculous,"This, without a doubt, will be the absolute last Llewelyn book I ever purchase. The book doesn't `walk the walk'. I was expecting to maybe find something interesting in the book based on the description, but once again, I find that the book is `exceedingly' superficial. It's comparable to a High School history book that talks about World War II for half a page. How Llewelyn stays in business and why people keep buying their books is something I will never understand. But at least books like this one are good for one thing they make certain that no new magickians can learn the trade, so the few magickians out there won't have any new competition.If you know `anything' at all about magick there is absolutely nothing new you will learn in this book."
1,It must be tough.,"It must be tough being considered 'the worlds greatest draughtsman' and not be able to get a likeness. Though the reproductions are great, this book is nothing more than a barrage of skewed logic and glaring omissions in a vain attempt to explain why in the past artists could draw and paint from life and today David Hockney can't."
1,Not the greatest resource for a working artist,"This book didn't impress me much, as an artist I wasn't convinced of his argument or his methods. His own drawings he did to support his argument were mediocre and uninteresting. [...]"
3,Someone Would Have Talked,"I got 1/2 way thru this book, before putting it aside to read Fletcher Prouty's ""JFK - The CIA, Vietnam and the Plot to Assassinate John F. Kennedy"".Frankly, I grew tired of reading about a bunch of rag-tag Hispanics who supposedly pulled off the crime of the century, all the while, doing the biggest favor in history for the Mafia and Military-Industrial Complex. I don't doubt the involvement of Anti-Castro Cubans in the crime; I just don't believe for a minute that they pulled it off seemingly alone. I'm sure to come back to it and finish it and I hope it ties what I've read so far into something more believable. It may well do that, but I'm not all that pleased with what I've read so far. It's just OK.Until then, Adios, Muchachos!"
3,Better editions are available.,"I am grateful to apocryphile for attempting to bring Irenaeus bac into print. However, this simply isn't the best edition out there. The text of the Ante-Nicene Fathers is presented here in its cramped format, hardly legible owing to its size. A much better edition that attactively re-sets the text while retaining in-text original page-numbers, is available here:Against Heresies."
5,Maggie Smith steals the Show.,"When one gets tired of the violence, sex, and quite frankly,impermissible bad language in modern films, it's nice to go back to someone who knows how to use language. eg. George Bernard Shaw. This movie was done (poorly) with Sophia Loren andPeter Sellers...but I adored the play with Maggie Smith. Oh...how she dominates her role. At once, we understand how magnificent a star she is. She plays the richest woman in England who is obsessed with getting what she wants, and having the cash to do it. She is beautiful and arrogant yet brilliant in the ways of capitalism. When she is given the challenge ofgetting a job and supporting herself without her wealth, well,she can do it because she understands money. Indeed she walks into businesses and transforms them into profitable enterprises. Whether the impact of her changes hurts the poor or middle class is of no concern to her...profitability is the key. This is a wonderful production and is a MUST for any Maggie Smith fan."
3,inaccurate description,"For some reason Amazon is starting to miss alot of details. This is a Deck only, the description is completely misleading.It goes into great details about the trucks and wheels but it is the deck only.The are also having a problem counting.They are stating you get two trucks and you only get one. This seems to be a problem with skateboards. But they should advise their sellers to knock it off.I may return it, too bad amazon.Just looked the board over in detail, and as much as I want to keep it.I can't even hang it on the wall as art, too many scratches and dings. I am nervous buying any skateboard stuff from amazon."
3,Lair of Bones,"The book was engaging and I enjoyed the first several books of the series. It was interesting to step into a world where magic held a different meaning. I will be reading Sons of the Oak in the near future, which is the next generation of the series."
3,A bit of a let down,"I was a bit disappointed with this installment of the series, as it seemed a bit rushed throughout. It was as if Farland wanted to finish the story before anything else happened. At least he had the courage to give the series some kind of conclusion, unlike some other writers, whom I won't mention. All in all, disappointed with the result."
3,A Bit Dissapointing,"I believe Craig Daniel's review summed up all that I wanted to say about it. And, like Craig, I would of given this book a 2 if it weren't for the other three books. And, unfortunetly, I don't think I'm interested in this series anymore...Beware, fans of Farland. This book may surprise you in a 'bad' way."
3,commodity product; buy where you want,I bought this item from the local office supply store. Costco has it cheaper and has a better return policy (and is 5 min. from my house). Buy this where it makes sense.
2,Enough of confusing standards and formats,"I wish the electronics manufacturers don't take consumers for granted. Every year, they come with new storage cards and drive formats. That is the reason many like me are not happy to buya a new electronic device. How can you improve the economy if you don't standardise these sort of things and give the confidence to the consumer that what he/she buys will stay productive and useful at least for two to three years? Remember it is the middle class common man who forms the largest consumer base. We just got over a few years ago from Betamax and VHS formats. Now we have competing DVD formats making most of us totally confused and preventing us from buying any of the multiformat DVD writers even! Until these sort of the incompatabilities are not sorted by all the manufacturers together, they are bound to loose their investment and have poor returns."
3,Meh,"Label came off easily...Pills are rather large. I'm sort of off and on with them. Been looking for the ""tonic"" version with a eyedropper but haven't found it. Probably more effective to use them well before flu and cold season but during... well I got both this year which was rare. So nothing special."
4,Fantastic!,"I was lucky enough to see an early screening of this film. If you love horror films with great twists in them, this is for you! Family Secret is an independent horror film with a non-existent budget, so as long as you realize that going in and aren't expecting some slick Hollywood Blockbuster full of CGI nonsense, you will enjoy this. They do manage to throw in a great fight scene at the end of the movie that will leave you breathless. Brings a great new character to the horror genre that will be remembered for a long time. Can't wait to see if there is a Family Secret 2!"
4,Great book w/ lots of helpful information.,The begining is great with the intro and life of the people used in the book. The self test were mindbending and fun at the same time. I scored quite good my first go around. If your looking into the FBI this is a good book
5,Heloises' daily helpful hints from Superior Home Video,"This is a great video! Over 75 million readers follow Heloise in print on a daily basis and now you can see Heloise demonstrate hundreds of hints on topics such as: getting organized, kitchen help, wash day hints, cleaning made easy, gardening, bedroom and closets, camping and picnics, garage and auto. Makes the perfect gift for showers, weddings, newlyweds and Mother's Day! Men also like this 102 minute video. Superiorvideo.com"
3,Sequel so close and yet so far,"Pride & Prescience preserved the characters from Austen's work as well or better than other Pride & Prejudice sequels, especially the spoken dialog. Yet this book allows a significant slip of character to occur in Elizabeth. We all know how she relishes the study of people's character, especially new acquaintances. How could this characteristic be written out in a story where it would have made for some fascinating turns of events? To stir in the magic theme was really a stretch and quite unnecessary. All that being said, it was a story that held my attention and reached a satisfying ending."
3,Pleasant sleuthing with Elizabeth and Darcy,"I don't understand the other reviewers' insistance that Caroline Bingley would never marry an American. They're absolutely right but Caroline, in this story, is bewitched. That's why she behaves out of character.As for Elizabeth and Darcy, it's always nice to see them again and both their banter and regard for one another is very nicely portrayed. I hope this becomes a series."
2,Austen and the Occult do not mix well,"I really enjoy the Stephanie Barron ""Jane Austen mysteries"" and thought that a ""Mr. and Mrs. Darcy mystery"" was a very clever idea. The book started well, I can live with some modernisms. Unfortunatly the book then veered in a direction completely contrary to the charactors Austen discribed. If Ms. Bebris wanted to write a story about the Occult in Victorian England that is fine, but she shouldn't highjack Jane and Darcy to do so."
1,An insult to Jane Austen--and her fans,"This book is boring and poorly written. It has a childish plot. It's a slight book and very easy to read, but few serious adult readers will bother to read very far into it. I read the whole thing and feel dirty now. Yuck!"
1,Poor Performance,"I bought two batteries for two Panasonic cordless phones. After only a few weeks, they barely last 10 minutes, less time than the batteries I replaced last for. Not worth the money I paid for them at all."
1,These batteries does not hold charge for even a day and they heat up,"I changed these batteries in my Panasonic cordless phones and they don't even seem to hold the charge for a day in standby mode. Also, while charging they heat up. I tried putting my factory batteries back and they won't heat up and hold charge longer than these new ones. I am planning to return this to Amazon."
5,Panasonic replacement phone battery,very viable replace ment for older Panasonic cordless phone - it seems to hold its charge as well as brand name batteries
1,Don't waste your money!,"I should have listened to the other reviewers who stated that the battery didn't last. Sure enough, it lasted 2 weeks and then quit. It's not worth paying the postage and time to send it back. Don't waste your money on this one!"
5,"Great replacement, especially the low cost",I checked local prices and found them to be several times the cost of this battery so I took a chance. It seems to be an exact replacement and is working well.
4,Become hot but no use problem,Battery make phone very hot on back. Some time I can't pick up phone it is so hot. But no very often this happen maybe few time. It has longer life than original phone battery.
5,One of the books I carry with me on business trips,"I'm a 57 year old Ph.D. mineral economist that finds, develops and operates mines and railroads. So this book should be, and kind of is, alien to me and most people I meet. The topics in this book are 3 times more exciting than the career I've loved since my first rock collection as a 5th grader. When I'm not working, my primary interest is consciousness. Christian's deft presentation is addictive. It's a text, it's a reference, it's an exploration, it's what I hope is the future. I can't quite seem to finish it without reading something related and then coming back. It seems to be part of a rapidly growing ""movement"" of very different people all searching. ""Radical Knowing"" is an integral part of my search. I can't wait to see where it leads me."
3,K's Kids Mimi Loves Fish,"It is kind of cheesy.. The fish that come with it are filled w/air, so if your children are teething, as mine are, then the fish never even made it to the bath before they were deflated. Then the Cat net does not even suction well on wall."
1,poor design,"while the guard works as it is supposed to, it is very hard to put a knife in it without cutting your hand. It has straight edges so you have to work at getting the knife into the guard."
3,"How about that, a plot!","Even though the plot is dull, at least it has a plot. I tired of the endless journey through fairy country, meeting new and odd people, especially after having finished [""Road to Oz""] immediately prior. Although one never believes the Nome king and allies pose much of a real threat, that is one of the beauties of a fairy country: no one is never in any real danger.This book also seems much more philosophical than many of the other Oz books as much ado is made about the fact that people in Oz don't have money and everyone just works for the good of everyone else because it pleases them to do so, and those who are tiresome are sent to live in cities made up of other people who are equally tiresome in the same manner. This is a sound philosophy, which, unfortunately only works in fairy countries."
2,It shrunk!,"This sheet is very nice and soft. However it shrunk enough so that I can still get it on my Pack n Play, but it causes the padding to bunch up."
3,My Friend Rabbit,"My Friend Rabbit by Eric Rohmann is so funny. Rabbit and Mouse are friends forever and Mouse's little airplane gets stuck in a tree and he cannot get it down. So Rabbit has an idea to get Mouse's plane. Rabbit brought an elephant, a rhinoceros, a hippo, a duck and her four babies, a deer, a squirrel, an alligator, and a bear to pile up high to get Mouse's airplane. The squirrel lifted Mouse up to reach the plane and then all of the animals fell. And Mouse got stuck with his airplane. The animals were mad at Rabbit. But Mouse is still Rabbit's friend because Rabbit tried to help Mouse get his airplane. I would like other people to get this book because this is a nice book and funny book."
4,As a teaching aid,This book would make a wonderful teaching aid. Its first hand accounts and lessons in perspective will draw in the reader while reminding them that these are memories that should not soon be forgotten. I have returned to this book several times and have recommended it ( with limited sucess ) to educators around the south and midwest. This book should be in every high school library.
1,these were defective,These pens were leaking inside the package. I didn't want to hassle with sending them back. I'm sure if you bought them at a store they would be fine as I've used this brand before and like it but it seems this obvious this seller sent out a defective product.
2,They Are A Bit Too Fine,These pens have lovely colors and I was hoping for fine but they are so fine that they're difficult to enjoy in my case.I won't buy them again & don't enjoy writing or printing with them.
5,The only pens I use,"I started using these pens back in middle school, around 6th grade when I was only 11. I am 19 now and these are the only pens I use. I've been spoiled by the smooth flow and the beautiful lines these pens provide. I have tried many other pens, but none give quite the comfort, the lines, and the flow as these do. You can even refill these if you don't want to buy a new pack, and although they are a little bit pricier than regular Bic pens, they are definitely worth the extra couple dollars. As an artist whose favorite medium is markers, I love to use the colored pens to detail some of my work and as a student, I love to switch up the colors to make my notes even more organized and easy to read. Don't ever let anyone borrow these pens because they'll never give them back because I guarantee you they have fallen in love."
3,For British TV Writers,"Not a bad book; seems well organized, but be aware: this is strictly oriented to British, not American TV."
4,Not that bad,I have read the reviews on this phone and I actually like it! I haven't had one single problem with it and it did eliminate my telemarketing calls. It had alot of the features that I was looking for for a great price.
3,Wedding ring soldering tweezers,"OK! Thanks. Otherwise, this holding tool is too small on the head and is hard to keep the ring stability to solder it."
4,dummy learns quick,"easy to follow, was able to pick up what i needed from this book without any difficulty. Even a dummy could do it."
2,"Are you yourself a dummy? If so, consider this book!","I'm willing to bet that anyone who uses this book as a stand alone study guide for the A+ exam will be broadsided by a mediocre (AT BEST) score, even if the book were open right next to you while taking the test.I just bought CompTIA A+ Practice Questions (Exam Cram by Que) second edition, and found myself reading questions that seemed completely foreign. I began using the 'Dummies' guide as a reference to answer the practice questions, and still found myself answerless. The test prep questions in the 'dummies' guide are really easy and give you a false confidence.In retrospect I would have saved my eyes the pain of reading over a thousand pages, had I known I would only need to read another book to fill in the gaps in my working knowledge. After reading this dummy-book, I have a dummy-edumacation to go with. Thanks dummies!"
2,PG-13 for language,"Fairly good story, unexpected ending. Downgraded rating because of constant and irritating use of the ""f..."" word."
2,works...even if you don't hook up the controllers,"Awesome idea, unfortunately the control does not work. I truly knew I was a sucker when I tried jumping up and down to raise my heart rate and successfully passed a challenge that was supposed to test my ability to relax. The only part of this game that was in any way a biofeedback experience was the calibration tool that would graphically display you heart rate...don't really need a $200 toy to do that. Don't believe the hype...you'll be disappointed.Wish some one would notice the interest in this product and make one that works.Why two stars? I guess anything that gets someone to sit down an meditate is not all bad. Still if you need motivation to start your meditation practice you'll get more mileage from a book on meditation."
1,Don't waste your money.,"I tried this software at the NYC Book Expo, & while it may be useful as a focusing program, the ""effects"" are the same whether one is happy, sad, focused, experienced, or a beginner. I tested the juggling and stairway segments, & the results were the same no matter what I thought about or tried. (I even tried reading several pages of my book while hooked up to the ""biofeedback sensors"" & still managed to keep my balls in the air!) You don't need to spend this much money on a relaxation/meditation program. Similarly topical audio cassettes can have the same effect--for a much smaller investment."
1,Condition was worse than what you would find at a garage sale.,"I ordered The Leadership Pill and it did say there were some pen marks on it. When I received the book I was shocked. It was filthy, and had so many marks on the pages that some pages were almost unreadable. I threw the book away and checked out a copy at the library. I really was concerned about what kind of germs the book might be harboring. This was my first and last experience ordering a used book."
1,lip pencil,"In spite of the fact that the company has record that the product was delivered, it was not.It may have been delivered to a wrong address but I didn't receive it. They have done nothing to make this right. Fortunately, it was not a major financial loss."
2,Mostly the same model over and over,"This book does have plans for several different steam engines, but they are basically the same oscillating engine in different positions (vertical, horizontal, twin cylinder), but they are all so similar that I don't think it is worth the money. Also, the author uses British terms which may not be familiar to US based model makers."
3,Decent for the money,"There seems to be a possible issue with the color of these tees....for me, they appear a bright, nearly neon color. Since you get so many for a VERY cheap price, these tees did exctly what they're designed to do. Would probably opt to go with a more natural hue in the future, but for now these work just fine. They're decent quality, super cheap tees that any novice golfer shouldn't be ashamed to try out. Not a five star review by any means, but until we find better v. the price Hubby plans to stick with these."
3,WILL ROGERS & POST dead,"Wiley Hardman Post 11/22/1898 to 8/15/1935. (1eye)Pioneering airman who flew the ""high wind"" at stratosphericaltitudes and who designed the protoypes for astronauts spacesuits.Been in prison for robbery,the oil fields,was a parachute jumper,stunt pilot and barnstormer.One interesting thing is Post did not know how to handle fame andwas always RUDE to people that approached him.This book remembers the EAGLE THAT HAS BEEN FORGETTEN.371 pages-2001-41 photos.The Sterlings say-Wiley was a genuine hero. IN the last chapter--the authors tell you what caused the plane to crash on the 15thAugust 1935..AND...what a very STRANGE CRAFT he was flying.Itwas called a float plane and it was poorly designed.The Sterlings have written several books on Will Rogers.The WINNIE MAE will be on display at the NALT AIR AND SPACEMUSEUM in 2013. (M A E was his wifes name.)bbbpokc ok63retired"
5,A Favorite,"The Good:I use this cookbook all the time, and every dish I've made from it has turned out great. Several have become family favorites: ""Big, Cool Noodle Bowl with Roast Chicken, Cucumbers, and Fresh Mint"" (p. 133), ""Shrimp Fried Rice"" (p. 122), and ""Crab and Asparagus Soup"" (p. 50) to name a few.The recipes are clear and easy to follow.The photographs are plentiful and accurately portray the dishes.It's a small thing, but the flaps on the front and back covers are very helpful since I usually make more than one dish from this cookbook at a time, and it saves me flipping back and forth.The Bad:There are a few recipes I haven't been able to try yet because I can't find the ingredients. Note: this is my own fault--I'm an American living in Germany and I just haven't taken the time & effort to translate the names of the ingredients and go to a local Asian grocery.The Verdict:I like this cookbook so much I got one for my adult children, who also use it."
3,Rainbow Six Rogue Spear,"First person sneaker, A clone of Thief The dark project. Sneak behind the bad guys and shoot them with a silencer, One flash bang weapon is just like the flash bomb in thief. The graphics and sound are good. The bad guys are very sharp shooters and just one shot is enough to get you down and you cant save the game in the middle of the mission. Single player gameplay is very difficult as you need atleast 4 persons to finish a mission."
1,Smells Like a Hoax to Me,"This book is a very interesting one, in part because it is probably one of the longest-running modern literary hoaxes. No one seems able to actually find the ""author,"" Anthony Godby Johnson.In 1993, Newsweek reporter Michele Ingrassia brought up the possibility of a hoax, and in the Nov. 21, 2001, issue of The New Yorker, reporter Tad Friend all but confirmed it....The following is documented fact, not opinion: Searches for Tony's birth certificate have come up empty, and police have no records of anyone committing the crimes Tony claimed his parents were convicted of....AIDS and abuse are serious topics, and should be addressed. I feel badly for those who were (in my opinion) misled into believing this is a true story. It may be inspiring, but we should be inspired by truth, not heart-tugging fictions."
5,"Truly a ""Triumphant Story""",Highly recommended for all over the age of 12 (due to content). A Rock and A Hard Place is a book about the realities of child abuse and the fact that it takes place everywhere. Tony speaks for all abused children.
1,This gets worse and worse,"Okay, first off, Vicki Zackheim, writes a fake memoir, pretending to be a boy with AIDS. Sick, but forgiveable. Next, she poses as this boy and tricks Mr. Rogers into believing her. MR. FREAKING ROGERS! That's morally reprehensible, and she could've damaged his credibility. Next, she up and marries a shrink, who then SIGNS A SWORN AFFADAVIT that says the boy exists, and uses THUG TACTICS on anyone investigating a book sold to the public. I won't go into the shrinks own problems that don't have anything to do with his wife, they are public knowledge.But worst of all, when she was posing as this child, she sent out pictures of one of her LIVING students that she taught in her fourth grade class. That is seriously disgusting."
5,There is always room for hope . . .,"is the deepest message of this beautiful and superbly written book that all should read. As a young man diagnosed with AIDS as a result of horrifying childhood abuse, Tony Godby Johnson writes about growing up, learning, and living, and tells his story with clarity, wit, tenderness, intelligence, feeling, and talent. This is not a wishy-washy ""happy ending"" type tale, nor is it glossed with movie-like melodrama--but it is an honest and beautiful and moving book about hope and love in spite of misery and hardship. Mr. Godby Johnson is an exemplary young man and I strongly encourage everyone to read his work. You will be not only be moved and impressed, but also inspired. -L. Jone"
2,Disappointment for this Discworld Fan,"I knew this wasn't meant to be an equal Discworld novel when I first opened it, but nevertheless I was disappointed. This lacks the character and fancy of Pratchett's other books. I kept expecting the plot to take an interesting twist, as Discworld novels often do, but was failed.Also, I was disturbed by a passage in which a rat-catcher strikes the young heroine - a blow so well described that I feel the fist in my own face... particularly distressing to read in juvenile literature."
2,Dragging down the curve...,"I'm a diehard Pratchett fan, and so when I bought this book after reading all the novels (up to The Last Hero), I felt distinctly let down. This wasn't a bad book in any way except comparing it to Terry's earlier works of two decades of witty retorts and spliced fables. This book has the same sort of premise, but has a distinct 'lite' feel about it, presumably for the younger audience he seems to be aiming for. The sad truth is this is not a kid's story, and the stripped-down vocabulary does not do justice to Terry's writing skills. All in all, this is, I say again, not a children's book and will not pass muster for the teenagers and the adults: It winds up in a no-man's land in the middle."
5,The Amqazinf Maurice,One of the best reads of Terry Pratchett. Although a little dark - perhaps not something for young teens to read. Enjoyed it immensly as it was a bit of a different take on the Discworld.
1,Rather work than Hunt,"Whatever happened to personal responsibility and self-determination? The reason people work so much is because they feel that it is a means to satisfy their wants. In a voluntary society, people exchange their resources because they see themselves better off afterward. I have a socialist friend that says he is a slave because he has to work. I fail to see how working in America is harder than trying to ""live off the land."" We have the highest standard of living in the world because we've earned it. I will continue to work and enjoy the fruits of my labor. I want the freedom to be able to work overtime if I need more money. I don't want the government limiting the amount of work that I'm ""allowed"" to do. This is my life and your life is yours. Make your own choices and decisions, and take responsibility for the results. Peace Out"
3,Cute...but...the clasp is horrible.,"When I received this neckace, I honestly thought there was no clasp. I studied the necklace and thought, ""Umm, it doesn't stretch, how am I supposed to get it around my neck?"" Then I realized the clasp is just a short, curved over piece of wire. The wearer is supposed to hook it through one of the holes of the chain. Which would be fine if one had the vision and manual dexterity of a Super-Human. I had to get my husband to hook it, and he had trouble.It is pretty though. I recommend wearing it with a scoop neck or V Neck blouse or dress. It really can't adjust to the right length to be worn with a collared shirt."
3,Comfortable if not sweating.,"The fabric is very smooth, warm, and comfortable, but if you're sweating, it does not wick well despite the claims. I would not buy this again for any winter activity other than driving a car or sitting in a snowbank."
1,"Poor construction, looks good but didn't last","This bag lasted me about 2 months before one of the straps started coming out of it's stitching, and I don't mean a little.It's too bad because otherwise I really liked this case, but the manufacturer decided saving a few pennies was worth more than extra stitching where it was needed most.Avoid this bag!!!"
1,Predictable and inane.,Right from the very first page this book proved to be disapointing. Michael was a dolt and Ellen even worse. I confess I gave up at about page 200 - blissfully never to return. Are they all this bad?
1,DO NOT BUY,"Do not buy this product, it cannot play VCD or SVCD also last week I expend a lot of time making a home video (DVD) on my computer and I cannot play it on the recorder, called Zenith and they told me the recorder is designed not to play computer made DVDs, the player will only play DVDs recorded by itself.Go get something else."
4,Good resource for people who live at high altitudes,"Have made a few recipes from this book and they are generally solid recipes. It's nice to know that the recipes have been tested at an altitude similar to mine. They have a cookie mix section that is interesting, although I haven't tried it yet. My only wish is that the recipes themselves were a bit more creative, they tend to be pretty basic."
3,Not suitable for Induction Cooker,"I mistakenly assumed that all All Clad pans would work on my induction cooktop. The LTD collection does not :( (For future reference, only the Stainless Steel pans will work on induction.) It's a gorgeous pan so I'm sad I cannot use it."
2,Made in China?,"Some things you could depend on- I almost cried when I saw on the box that this all-clad piece was no longer made in the USA, but in China.May as well get the cheap stuff at Macy's. . . you can get the whole set on sale for $$99"
3,"Rambling, but readable, and an interesting look at first love.","NOTHING SERIOUS reads mostly like a a journal, or a incredibly long, often incohesive and random stream of thought. The novel is more about what and how the character Louise Levy thinks and how she experiences and interprets the world than about any particular events. In fact, the basic events of the plot are revealed pretty early, although perhaps out of sequence, and the story holds no real surprises. I was only so interested in Justine/Louise's mania, (though I was relieved when she seemed to figure it all out) so it took me a while to finish the book. I put it aside often to read something more interesting. I also think that the prose of this novel just does not work as well in English. The writing style is palatable in French, and is mostly annoying in English.The story itself -- I think that it could be told just fine through an long literary essay. As it book, it just seems to belabor the point."
3,Interesting,"If you like old ""corny"" movies, you'll like this. Very clean entertainment for the christian family. Lynn Redgrave is a crack up. The story line is silly, but enjoyable. My teenagers and I watch it one night when we were bored. After the movie ended we all laughed and talked about the silliness of this movie. It was just great for an entertaining night with my kids. It's not a great production or good quality, but it was good, humorous entertainment for my family. A little cursing, but nothing objectionable. Just by one main character. Words that people would have found ""shocking"" in the early 1900's. Other than that, a good laugh. If you're wanting a serious movie, don't watch this. This story is just humorous! The ending is abrupt and interesting. Enjoy. I give it 3 stars just because of the quality of the production."
4,Unique and universal-thoroughly engaging,"The exotic setting has nothing on the unique characters in this delightful book. Building from universal foundations of middle-age angst, these characters explore their past as they confront unpleasant and ignored presents. Their efforts to create a better future drag in old and young, strangers and lovers-even a cat. This is a great, distinctive read."
4,Unhinged,"Good book, some what outdated but well written. Many of the things still ring true about the liberals of today. I would recomend it to anyone who wonders what the h--l's going on in todays goverment, it's out of control."
5,Top Notch Reporter Unveils the Moonbats,"Michelle Malkin is a courageous reporter. She is not afraid to report the truth. It is sad that the truth causes so many to lay bare their ""unhingment"" for full public display as shown by the hate-filled reviews herein. However, these reviews only add weight to the authenticity of the books contents.I have only read parts of the book at this time. However, each of the reported instances of liberals gone wild is documented. Each reported unhinged deed is verifiable by court records, newspaper reports, etc.Finally, I suggest we all read the book before we render final judgment. If you haven't read Michelle Malkin before, you will be pleasantly surprised by her skilled writing, and depth of analysis and research."
5,Telling The Matter As It Is,Mrs. Malkin has a talent for stating facts in an interesting way and documents her references with 37 pages of notes. The unhinged ones probably have had their lawyers spend much time looking for a mistake.
1,Malkin Gone Wild,"I swear, you'd think this women were the empress of a small kingdom, or banana republic. She certainly thinks and acts like one. Over the years, I've had the joy (sic) of reading her rants in the local paper. Woe to you if you are the child of an undocumented immigrant in need of an organ transplant (demon seed!). Or, if you are the principal of the school where her young children attend (get your liberal innoculations away from my kids!).I saw her on television last night, peddling her book. She complained about people sending her hate mail full of ethnic slurs. I, for one, do not condone such behaviour. I don't hate the woman, just her ideas. At her core, she's a very angry woman in need of therapy.I challenge Mrs. Malkin to write Unhinged II: Exposing Conservatives Gone Wild. Oops, Al Franken already beat her to it."
4,Very good book but,"Some statements in this book are just her opinion. It is the author's opinion that Condi Rice is such a remarkable woman. An opinion I don't share. Yet the author presents this opinion like it is a fact. The democrats often stink with unbacked up ""facts"". But in casting that opinion on Condi like it was a fact so did Malkin."
1,Regenery! Oh what a surprise!,"Oh my! Another insta-book from a radical conservative bobblehead that parrots all of the talking points from the insta-books of all the other radical conservative bobbleheads! (Really, without the pictures on the cover, could you tell if it was Laura Ingramn Ann Coulter, or Michelle Malkin who was the author?) Who could be the publisher? Why, Regenery! Wow! Well, they're still in business, so they either have a good sugar daddy or the same thousand people on the mailing list buy every book they publish. Bully for them. The rest of you, don't waste your money. If you really want to sample Malkin's Mania, go to her website. She says everything she does in the book, but you save your $$$."
1,Completely idiotic and disgraceful,"Perhaps Malkin would know better than to write a completely idiotic book that disgracefully bashes liberals while doing nothing to prove that conservatives are any better because they aren't. All fault finding and no solutions. If Malkin really was a conservative, she wouldn't have shown her intolerance to others.THE DEATH OF CONSERVATISMThe Destruction By The Neo-Cons Of All That Was Held Dear By Conservatives Has A Growing Number Joining The Ranks Of Independentsby Samuel A Stanson[...]"
2,www.sportofdistraction.com,"When will we stop feeding the careers and pocketbooks of extremists such as this? The extremists on the left are no better, but Michelle Coulter and Ann Malkin seem to get an imbalanced amount of publicity, in comparison to their liberal counterparts.And no, that wasn't an error, I just can't tell the difference between the two (2).Read a book that contains an authentic thesis, making genuine arguments: [...]"
1,"Response to ""JAY"" (I suspect aka Ms. Malkin herself)","I have not read the book. However, I saw Ms. Malkin on CSPAN two days ago and was frightened by her using, for this book, individual examples of nuttiness and trying to act as if these were the norm on the liberal side. Along the same lines, she took examples of hateful emails to hold up for scrutiny but did not mention one thoughtful, non-slur filled email that might have made her thing twice about another person's thoughtful view of the world.Also, I have to say that I can't help but suspect that the ""Jay"" review on Feb. 8, 2006, was actually Ms. Malkin herself. Reasons? On checking the most recent 20 reviewer's ""See all my reviews"" links, only Jay and one other reviewer had reviewed this book and no others - most had many reviews. Additionally, the point-counterpoint is so precise, it leads me to think that this person had a really good knowledge of the book.She is like Bill OReilly on conservative steroids."
4,A decent and thoughtful read,A book which brings to light the increasing failure of civilized debate into violent malicious acts. How sad that the Democratic party is being dragged down by the liberal far left fanaticism.
1,I tried,"I was really hoping to enjoy this book and find some original thought in it. Alas I was sorely disappointed. It is nothing but the same recycled insults and half truths peddled by any number of similar books. While I expect Ms. Malkin to be partisan this really takes it to a whole new level. Her vitriol for ""THE LEFT!"" is so hypocritical and ridiculous that it's absurd (a term that increasingly defines Malkins career). Anyway, if you want to read a book bashing liberals there is better, if you want to read something thoughtful about contemporary politics and the media this isn't even close."
1,Unfazed: Uncovering Conservatives Gone Insane,"Looks like Ann Coulter has a sister who needs some quick cash, so she uses an alias, throws in a few buzz words and phrases, picks on American patriots who feel this country doesn't have to settle for mediocrity, and spews out some literary diarrhea. Apparently, if you like wars, scandals, deficits, and decaying values, then you have alot in common with this those in this administration."
5,The truth about liberals,"Michelle's book presents the cold hard truth about liberals and their sick ways. She is not posting only her opinion of them, she backs it up with facts. She should be praised for writing this book."
4,Funny!,"This is funny stuff, but not as funny as ""All 'Bout Me an Arkansas Tail""-- the parody of Bill Clinton's ""My Life"""
2,"boring, no new content","The issue here is that Malkin isn't really speaking to me. The endless accounts of, well, liberal unhingededness are boring. If you follow her blog, there is precious little new content. If you don't follow her blog, go ahead and pick up the book - there will be a lot of new stuff here for you.I like the content, I read her blog daily, and that is why I'm giving this two stars."
5,Truth Drives The Left Wild,"Michelle Malkin is rapidly becoming one of top ten bloggers with factual information that adds context to the bias of mainstream media. Her new book goes beyond exposing the bias, and focuses on the unfortunately not-so-isolated cases of liberals gone mad. Some of these barely made the papers, but taken together, they are instructive of a left that has taken on bullying ways to 'sell' its agenda. Obviously, none of this works, and is driving less 'passionate' democrats away enough to turn over the numerical advantage to self-confessed conservatives by about 2:1. And numbers like that only drive the left into even greater rage."
1,kinda like a high school paper,"I flipped though this book (it's a lightweight read) and thought, ""Wow, how many hours would it take to write a parallell book, printing crazy emails from republicans, citing evidence of right-wingers attacking and harassing left-wingers, quoting calls for murder from neo-cons, etc. etc."" This is a lazy book. She is a weak thinker and damages important and legitimate conservative philosophy."
1,"A Better Title: 'Control-C, Control-V, Where's My Advance?'","Oh dear. Malkin's rag-bag of lazy, out-of-context pseudo-references, makes Ann 'Footnotes' Coulter look like an example of scholarly rectitude. One wonders how Malkin's own writing would fare if subjected to her 'treatment'."
3,Nice book,This book will open your eyes but became a little too much at times. I'm glad I read it but it was a chore to read at times.
5,The French Chef 1 & 2,"I have been waiting for years for these DVDs to appear. Julia Child was an amazing woman who inspired me as a young bride to cook. She was, in addition to being a superb chef, a wonderful teacher. Her techniques and the recipes stand the test of time. My daughter, an excellent cook in her own right, has heard me talk about Julia Child and now she has her own copies of both DVDs. My daughter had watched Julia Child as a guest on television shows but now that she has actually seen the ""Master Chef"" in action she appreciates why I have been in love with Julia Child for so long. Julia Child goes back to the basics of cooking, showing the techniques that you have to master to become a really good cook."
2,Evil Dead 3: Regeneration,"It was very short, which makes the player very frustrated and the buyer downright angry. Ash & Sam are really well detailed but most everthing else is pretty poor, graphicly. The cinematics are very well done, which is pleasing. I don't recall any interesting music. The ""Secrets"", like collecting Necronomicon pages etc, hearing Bruce Campbell talk was useless information that didn't last long enough. After a while in the game you find you are using the classic rocket and harpoon guns just to keep going. This is a real dissapointment."
5,Vin in a new light - NOT AN ACTION FLICK!,"I suspect the negative reviews come from people who enjoy watching Vin Diesel in action flicks. If that's the case, of course you're going to be disappointed in this independent drama. But, if you're a fan of movies that subtly tease your emotions through daily, realistic dialog, then you're going to love this movie. There are plenty of laughs, infatuation, love, lust, guilt, morality, ethics... you name it. They all come to light in this drama. This is a great movie if you enjoy ""thinking"" movies. If you're looking for hard-core action that requires little thought, this movie is not for you."
1,the worst movie ever,"Not even if you dont have nothing important to do, dont watch this movie, is a waste of time."
3,Movie is amazing. But Buyer Beware! Review for the physical product,"This is for the Bandai/CrunchyRoll release.I just bought this DVD and this review is for the DVD itself and not the amazing movie on it. I recently bought the disc off another site and received the disc in the mail. I opened it and it just so happens that the RFID anti-theft tag was on the underside of the disc. THE SIDE WHERE THE DATA IS ON. So I removed it carefully, I've got steady hands but some residue remained and I didn't think much of it. I played the disc and found some playback errors on it.If you ever buy it, I would suggest spraying on some glass cleaner fluid on the sides of the anti-theft tag to loosen it before you try peeling it off.Art, music, and the movie is amazing. My love for anything that Shinkai makes still makes me look over something stupid like this."
5,this film is great,"This film is one of the best film I have seen. The story flows nicely, all the sequences were very realistic. What touched me the most was the ending montage combined with that great song. I have never been this moved by a movie before."
2,Didn't work on my 07 Taurus,This belt seemed a little longer than the original one I took it off. Used it anyway and it worked great for about 2 weeks. Then the chirping started again. I then bought the original ford Motorcraft belt and so far it's worked great but it's still early and only time will tell. Someone said that it doesn't work with AC but I don't think that was the case. Isn't AC pretty much a standard part now days? I also changed the tension and idler pulley so that is not part of the problem.
1,is it just me or is this cd terrible?,The only good song is this cd is Last Dayz. The other songs are only 25% or under. Most rap cds are good except for this one.
3,Didn't fit,"We registered for this mobile, and were excited to get it. However, we found a problem when we tried to install it - since we have a sleigh-type crib with extra wide slats, the mobile wouldn't fit securely onto the crib, so we had to take it back. I was heartbroken, as it is such a cute mobile, though, and would have loved if it it fit correctly."
3,Adorable...but boring,"I bought this because I think it is absolutely the cutest mobile out there. But my daughter doesn't find it very interesting, and when you wind it up, the music plays only for a very short time. Disappointing!"
2,"Cute, but not useful","If you have a crib that has rounded ends as we do, it is difficult to attach, although we did figure a way. My son likes to look at it, but it has WAY TOO SHORT of a song and spin cycle. We took off the music and motor and reattached with just some string. Now our son is able to watch it spin for a much longer time and he prefers the ocean aquarium music anyway."
2,Cute but not worth the money,"Certainly not worth $40. It's cute because it matches my baby's stars/moonbeams nursery theme but it's not the best quality. You have to assemble the hanging moon & stars yourself which is a bit tedious. I have to say, my baby loves looking up at it & enjoys the music. He kicks his legs & coos like crazy. But...the music plays only a short time, which is a pain because I have to keep winding it. A mobile should have music that lasts longer than this!"
2,Try Something Else,"Controls are not intuitive and, three years after installing, I STILL need to refer to the manual. Having to press Power Setting numerous times to count down to what you want is so tedious."
4,Very well-written and interesting take on Superman,"Ignore the naysayers who say this isn't a good Superman book. This is the AUTHOR'S OWN INTERPRETATION of a Superman story, and I think it's well-written, set well in it's time-period, and very engaging. If you're looking for Superman smashing through walls and deflecting cannon blasts, then you're reading the wrong story. Like Kurt Busiek's recent ""Secret Identity"", this is a brand new take on the whole story, and it's well worth a read.My ONLY nitpick is that the author really overdoes it with the use of italics. He uses italics in almost every paragraph, and it become distracntingly annoying after a chapter or two. Otherwise, this is a great book and I highly recommend it."
2,A Little of Everything,"But not enough to explain any one process through. OSX users, be advised, most of the dialog boxes are Windows which you need a magnifying glass to see."
3,Randolph Scott,"This dvd is worth what I paid for it. I bought it for the colt .45 movie alone, I liked the title! The colt.45 movie was okay, but was not at all accurate. In the movie, Randolph Scott is a gun salesman, and has two of his prized colts stolen, but they are actually colt dragoons, an earlier cap-n-ball style percussion revolver. What is usually meant by a ""colt.45"" is an 1873 colt peacemaker in .45 colt caliber. I really liked ""fort worth"", it was the best of the three movies. For fans of early westerns, and Randolph Scott, this movie pack is a good deal."
5,excellent Scott triple feature,"Fort Worth and Tall Man Riding are two of the best of the Crooked Businessman subgenre of Westerns. In particular, Tall Man Riding is verywell plotted and most enjoyable.Colt 45 is what I call a Saturday afternoon Western. A lot of disbelief has to be suspended to get into it. Native Americans speak with excellent use of nouns and verbs but no articles, although at least they are not the villains. For the heavy, we have none other than Zachary Scott and his performance is wonderfully over the top. Overacting is not the word. He is totally psychotic and possibly even sets new standards in Western villainy.All three films have great picture quality and terrific Warner Brothers Ranch/Chatsworth location photography.There's little that can be said about Randolph Scott that hasn't already been said. Because he did so many of these so-called B Westerns he may have been underrated by snobbier critics. I think he was a really great actor.Highly recommended."
5,great tool,"I am very satisfied with this tool. It is limited in the sense it can only bend 1/8 inch tubing but it does it extremely well. I have, however a suggestion regarding the handles: the product should provide ( even if as an option ) a shorter handle so tubing can be bent in an ""S"" shape. The reason why they cannot is because the handle is in the way of a previous ""U"" shape tube."
3,Reasonably good look at the great man and his works,"I enjoyed some aspects of this book, especially the concise biography of Drucker at the start, but found it a bit dull overall. The author takes a good look at all Drucker's work, the developments in his thinking over his long and productive life, even his writing style, but it is all done in a rather dry, humourless, academic manner. It is clear that Drucker is a great thinker on management and society, but it doesn't always come across like that when reading the passages from his books that are quoted. I think the way the passages are quoted, in boxes separate from the main body of text, serves to decontextualize them, making some of them appear rather shallow and commonplace.Having said this, The World According to Peter Drucker is still a worthy introduction to/critique of Drucker's writings and worth reading. It is largely concise and to the point, which helps given that it is not all that exciting."
2,If you have never heard of Drucker - Don't read this yet !,"Yes, Drucker's writings are far more impactful and persuasive that his words lose their impact even when quoted verbatim by Beatty !However, if you are familiar with Drucker's works, this book will basically bring to memory points you may have forgotten.But to learn in one book Drucker's vast writings, you may want to read Flaherty."
5,"No, KAB and I are not the same guy...","If I had this book and/or Thomas Woods' ""PIG to American History"", it's doubtful the teachers in my Public (government) School would have let me graduate. But, I would have been well armed against all of their intellectual bigotry.The book makes an excellent companion to the other Politically Incorrect Guides: To Islam and to American History. The language is accessible even though the task of taking on all of the history of science may seem daunting at first glance. It's a book I would challenge all highschoolers to read; and their teachers.But, for a more in depth treatment of their respective subjects I would recommend Dr. Rizzi's ""The Science Before Science."" Or, If it's Darwinism that piques your curiosity, try the recently released ""Evolution and Other Fairy Tales."""
1,"Beware, this opener is having a real QC problem with circuit board","Today a professional installer replaced the control board on my new unit for the 4th time in less than one month. That is we have had 3 consecutive control board failures on a new system all within 12 hours of the replacement boards installation. When questioned about this, the Apollo Service Tech in San Antonio said ""it has been known to happen"". How Apollo expects to stay in business with this level of manufacturing QC is beyond me. Unfortunately, I purchased this system from an authorized dealer/installer and not Amazon so at the moment I do not know my replacement alternatives.Save yourself a lot of trouble, particularly if you plan to self install, CHOOSE ANOTHER BRAND, even factory qualified professionals installers can not seem to get this to work.This would be zero stars if Amazon would allow that rating."
4,Good Big Band Sound,"I listened to most of this CD while in a music store. What I liked about it is that it incorporates the many facets of the Big Band era -- not just the typical swing that has been inundating us lately. I've listened to swing music since I was born (my father grew up in the Big Band era) and this reminds me a lot of what he had me listening to. The Sing, Sing, Sing remake is good, but nothing beats Benny Goodman's version. All-in-all, this is a great mix of sound. A lot of fun!"
3,quality below average,"for the price, the material and workmanship could have been better, zippers feel like they will break off. I don't recommend this bag for quality however there is plenty of room in the bag for what every you might need at the range. Because of the workmanship, I wouldn't load it with too much weight."
5,used everything else and this finally works.,I absolutely love this product I have been using it for over two years now. I have really thin hair and I like to spike it. I keep my hair less than two inches and it works great. It lasts all day and washes out easily. It also gives my hair a fuller look because my hair looks dry after applying it. I would not recommend it for people who want the wet look. but for me it works great. It is worth the money being that I probably would spend over 25 dollars a month trying other products that i was just disappointed in. one jar usually lasts me over three months.
2,Very medical model,"I found this book to be a good primer on the basics, but it is definitely written from the perspective of a physician. There is very little mention of the wide array of choices women have when it comes to care providers and methods of coping with labor pain (midwives, doulas). It is a book that describes the typical 'cookie cutter' protocol of OB care, and leaves much to be desired for women wishing to be informed of all the options available to them. Very disappointing."
2,Left Me A Bit Shaky,"Pregancy is supposed to be a joyful experience. I had to stop reading this book about twelve weeks into my pregancy because it was scaring me to death! I realize that women should be informed, however, this book focused too heavily on complications instead of ways to maintain a healthy, happy pregnancy. I suggest ""What to Expect when You're Expecting"" as a great alternative. It is factual and informative, but not so negative."
2,Too negative,"This book details pregnancy week by week. For each week, the book spends way too much time explaining all of the bad things that could be happening. It was actually scary and I felt awful after reading the first few chapters. I am returning this book."
5,Your Pregnancy Week by Week,"A friend who had just had a baby recommended this book so I immediately bought a copy. And I am so happy that I did. I found the book very easy to grasp as well as informative. I would look forward to reading about my baby's development each week. In fact, I enjoyed ""Week by Week"" more than ""What to Expect..."" Now I buy this book for all of my pregnant friends!"
2,Needs more information,"I agree with other reviewers that there is too little information on the progress of each week of development. There is also too much information on what can go wrong in proportion to what should be happening. Every expecting person or couple should have this very important information, but they should also have more information on what normal pregnancies have in store. I found it just a bit too general in that regard."
4,This is a good book,"I liked this book, however I found out I was having twins so a lot of it was just general information rather than for my specific pregnancy. That being said it was helpful and I liked the week by week information. I would definitely recomend this book to all moms to be out there."
1,Dr. Bradley is better,"This is a very informative book but really points you towards giving total trust to the hospital and not that you are the one who should be in control.I highly recommend Bradley coached child birth books. He was the first doctor in America to allow fathers into the delivery room and has overseen over 400,000 births, so I would think that he knows what he is talking about. He takes the control away from the hospital staff and puts the mother back in charge of her body and her baby's. Please be warned that the second book below has graphic photos.Husband-Coached Childbirth (Fifth Edition): The Bradley Method of Natural ChildbirthNatural Childbirth the Bradley Way: Revised Edition"
2,"Negative, Alarmist - will only stress you out!","All in all, this book is fine. But I cannot recommend it. It is very negative and reads almost like a medical textbook, listing all of the possible things can could go wrong at every stage - without little in the way of comfort. The bulk of each chapter is pretty negative and then at the end there is an attempt at a 'cheery' summary - which, by the time you get there, you really need. Unfortunately, I have put this book down too many times with a furrowed brow - I am not going to even finish reading it. There are plenty of better books out there with the same information - written by a doctor or not!"
4,good reading,bought this book on recommendation of a friend. my wife likes it better than the other very popular pregnancy info book.
1,Please Avoid This Book. Too Much Focus On The Negative.,"After five pages of miscarriage in week 8, week 11 pleasantly reminds you ""If a miscarriage occurs after this point, it may be possible to tell if it was male or female."" GREAT.I understand that things go wrong--but most of the time they don't. Though I believe that information on what could go wrong has it's place (like it's own section maybe) I don't think it warrants devoting a major percentage of the book on what horrible things could potentially harm your baby, downplaying the positive aspects of your pregnancy."
2,Not for me!,"This book wasn't what I needed during pregnancy. It wasn't very thorough! It has absolutely NO table of contents, you can't find anything you need when you need it. What to expect when your expecting was MUCH better! Luckily this book was given to me and I did not waste any money on it!THe only thing I liked about it was that it went week by week rather than month to month. BUT I can find any info they put on the 1-2 page description anywhere online.The weekly description is literally a page/page and half and the rest is all problems you may have!"
5,A Pregnancy Essential,"This is a great book for women who want to know what's happening to their bodies and their babies every step of the way. Unlike other pregnancy books which are only broken down monthly, this book informs the reader of the baby's development each week, how your body is reacting, and other pregnancy-related issue. Some of the information seems a bit alarmist, but in general, a must-have book for all impatient mothers-to-be!"
1,"boring, don't buy","This is the most boring book about pregnancy. I couldn't even read it for more than 10 min, even though I am so eager to know what going on with the baby."
5,AWESOME BOOK!,This book is gr8! Not only does it explain the changes your body goes through week by week but it also shows you pictures of the baby and how he/she changes. Also pictures of how your body will change as well. I enjoyed this book far much better than What to Expect When Your Expecting!! Highly recommend this book for someone who is expecting or for a shower gift.
2,Scary book for first timers,"Every entry in this book starts off wonderfully with a description and a picture of what your baby looks like this week. But you should only buy this book if you promise to stop reading it after the first few paragraphs! Every single entry quickly deteriorates into some scary, tragic information about birth defects or pregnancy problems that happen to only a few people. Try reading Girlfriends' Guide by Vicki Iovine instead -- it's about real women having real children."
1,"Nice weekly format, but negative and worrisome","The week by week format makes the book easy to read, however I have found many unnecessary and worry-provoking entries which really turned me off from the book. For example, every week has a section ""How Your Actions Affect Your Baby's Development"". In one of the early weeks, this section is entirely about different types of miscarriage, which made me wonder if Dr. Curtis is somehow implying that all misarriages are caused by women's actions? Further on, there are sonogram pictures of a tumor as well as a knot in the umbilical cord, without any note that such conditions are extremely rare. What the point is of including these anxiety-provoking points, I do not know. As well, Dr. Curtis seems to take a rather traditional medical viewpoint to pregnancy. Overall, I found the book to be more bothersome than helpful, both in its lack of explanation of some dangers and its overabundance of worry-provoking entries. I would not recommend this book."
3,There's much better books out there,"I got this book for free when I registered with my hospital.Having read many other books including ""What to Expect when You're Expecting"", Dr.Miriam Stoppard's ""Conception, Pregnancy and Birth"" and ""the Complete Book of Pregnancy and Childbirth"" by Sheila Kitzinger, I found this to be the least informative of the four. Although the book contains many health tips, there's also quite a few diagrams of rare occurances such as a prolapsed cord, Placenta Previa, a knot in the cord, etc which were listed under particular weeks. I found these diagrams to be misleading (as if this is something one should expect at a particular week!)My advice: save your money and buy or borrow one of the other books I mentioned."
3,Not my favorite pregnancy Book!!!,"This book is just not one of my favoites. It seems very insinsitive at times and not very helpful in the way it's laid out. Everyone's pregnancy is different. you wouldn't know it by reading this book.. The pictures are great because they show week by week. Some people might find this book very helpful. There are some parts that were helpful to me, but I really could have done withought it."
3,"A Decent Book, But Not to Be Used for a Single Reference...","As a first time mother-to-be, when I saw the title of this book, I was so excited that I purchased it without even reading the reviews. Now that I have it in my possesion, I really wish that I would have read them.I appreciate the illustrations that show the progress of a baby's development week-by-week, but the text leaves a lot to be desired. After reading about my baby's progress each week, I was still left with a lot of questions as well as slight paranoia from reading about all that could possibly go wrong with one's pregnancy. A little warning is good, but don't beat me over the head with it.I have found ""What to Expect When You're Expecting to be a much better reference as well as ""The Girlfriends Guide to Pregnancy"" by Vicki Iovine.My advice, save your money and only purchase the latter two books that I mentioned."
5,This book provides you with what you need!,"I enjoyed seeing the progress that my baby and I were making week by week as opposed to in one big chapter. I hungered for information, and was completely satisfied with this book. You will have no regrets if you buy it... I promise. Also check out 125 Things You Must Know About Being Pregnant for a sweet and friendly advice book on pregnancy. I got these two and returned What to Expect."
1,Terrible Book,"Pretty much everything has been covered already. This book is horrible and does nothing to help encourage a woman to understand, educate herself, and feel any sense of empowerment in pregnancy or childbirth. It basically reduces the mother to a medical victim and pregnancy into nothing but constant, potential illness.This is one of the few books I've ever tossed straight into the recycle bin. No passing this book on. It's that awful, really."
5,Wonderful book!,"This book was recommended to me by my sister-in-law, and I just love it. Now when I have a friend that is pregnant, I send her this book to read. Very informative, and if you are impatient like me, very nice as it leads you through week by week, instead of month by month. I loved telling my family and friends, ""my baby has eyelashes this week"" or "" my baby is six pounds on average this week."" I truely enjoyed this book, and recommend it to everyone. The end of the book did not have TONS of info on the baby, but instead had info on labor and delivery and the hospital stay. This book is wonderful!!! P.S. My husband liked the dad tips, too. Made him feel a part of the pregnancy."
1,Worst Book,"This is so far the worst book ever written. If you are an expectant mother alongside with your husband whos looking for more information and answer to those question, this book is not for you. You might as well go to your local library and search for an alternative."
4,Love it!,"My husband and I put this up together. We decided to use extra glue, just in case. We got it very wet, and it didn't smudge. It looks great and is definitely boy/girl! I'm sure our little one will enjoy it as much as we do."
4,30 men one winner one chance.,"the wwf tagtitls,was a good opener edge&crishtion v.s the dudles .the ladder match is the best match of the night i think y2j v.s binuot stud in all.china v.s ivery was a good match but ivery did not win fare and china shud have won the title.HHH vsangle was a graet match a little slow at first but heated up a chick fight in the middle and ston cold beating the heak out of HHH.the rumble was the best rumble of the wwf stone cold won for the third time setting a record.I love this dvd you shud buy it."
1,"Awful, absoulutely awful.","This is absoulutely rubbish, take my advice and don't buy it. I was expecting a good show but what I got was terrible wrestling and I didn't like it.This is the first new (1998-) WWF show I have seen and it was a real let down. Dudley Boyz Vs Edge and Christian didn't have many exiting moves in it and the ending to Chyna Vs Ivory was the worst ending to a match I have ever seen. Benoit Vs Jericho was OKish but nothing amazing. I was expecting a lot from Angle Vs HHH but I got nothing.The Royal Rumble match Was really boring and I don't think anyone was supprised with Stone Cold winning.WWF has too many boring storylines and I'm getting really fed up with it.Rent or buy some WCW Wrestling Videos if you want real wrestling not this TRASH!"
3,"Not the best at all, But hey its Royal RUmble a must own","The Royal Rumble its self isnt the best,,, The Ladder Match is kinda long but very good,, I thin kthe Triple H vs. Kurt Angle was kinda lame they could have done some more thean attemp to sell an injury to the crowded...You mostly see Sunday Night Heat clips as the special fueatures,, but it is kinda funny wear Drew Carry is in the Rumble and disqualifys himself!.Its to bad this thing ran out of print about 3 to 4 months after its realse so now its pretty rare!"
5,Priceless!!,"This is a really great movie, It is really funny. I am on here right now to buy it! It has the same kind of feeling to it as P.S. I Love You, and Holiday!If you loved those movies you will really love this one too."
4,A SWEET MOVIE,Being a CHUCK fan I decided to give this movie a go knowing it would be a little different from my favourite comedy show. (Luckily in Australia CHUCK is still playing)I found Shades of Ray it to be a very enjoyable movie. The movie was not very long and whilst it was predictable at times it was still a good movie and it was great to see Zachary Levi in a different role.Certainly worth watching.
3,"fun, but not very good...","I Dunno...this is sort of *enjoyable*, but even as you're enjoying it, you feel sort of guilty, because objectively you know that this is not particularly good stuff. You certainly can't compare it to Weis's earlier work with Hickman or on her own. It may be worth blowing some time on--it's fun in it's own right--but I wish Weis would stop mucking about and get back to writing *good* fiction."
2,Poor Design/Manuf Quality,"Failed out of box. Talked retail seller into a swap (normally wait forever from a ""Qualified Service Dealer""). Failed a year later (boxed most of that year). Over heating caused shut down. Reviews on web indicate this is a common problem. At a minumum get a service contract, but be prepared to regularly send it back.Worst (quality) consumer electronics device I've ever owned."
5,Matches Moonbeam Crib Set,This was on our registry along w/the crib set. It matches great & looks wonderful in our nursery. It adds the perfect decorative touch that our daughters room needed!
3,"Poor quality, but cute!","Like most of the Koala Baby items, this isn't the best of quality. We tried to tear the tags off one of the hangings and it came apart. They als just feel kind of cheap. However they do look cute when they serve their purpose on the nursery wall. We have the whole Moonbeam nursery going on, so they really fit in."
3,Okay,"Although this game doesn't introduce anything drastically new, I knew what I was getting. So its not as exciting as the expansion packs, but its still there. I agree that I'm more looking forward to a ""glamour pack"" because that sounds more enjoyable, but Maxis actually enriched the family feeling with this pack. It's not as good as the expansion packs, but I'd still encourage getting it, just because you can."
3,Sims2 - 5 Stars - Packs like this - 3 Stars,"In trying to appeal to everyone, EA releases packs that cram in furnishings, architectural embellishments and fashions. I know this game is something different for each person, so I'm not knocking it, but I wished for less clothes and more furniture. Guess it's off to Sim-PE land for me!"
3,Ok,"I got this suff pack for $10 and that was with tax. It is ok but I would not have paid $20 for it. Actually I don't understand why all of these stuff packs just put out one pack and call it ""Extra stuff"" with MAXIS content and 3rd party stuff and sell that for $20. I mean have like 500 items in it. Make the paying customers happy. Guess thats 2 much like right..................damn shame."
3,Not the best expansion pack,"I'm a huge fan of the sims! especially the sims 2. whenever a new expansion pack comes out i get it,knowing it's going to be great. But this is the first one i don't care for and don't recommend. The new outfits and decor items are not that great.I even got a virus after i downloaded it! The walls in my sims houses keep blinking red.I gave this expansion pack 3 stars overall, because since it's sims its automatically great. the other 2 stars are because it's not what i figured it would be. I hope i saved people from ruining their computer's with this game. I do recommend buying all the other expansion packs though!"
3,family fun stuff,"only if you like to use kids a lot in your games. i have kids, thus they are not needed in my sims2 game. ;^)some cool new objects, though. kids will love it."
3,Sims2 Fun Stuff is Fluff,"I'm glad I read the -/+ reviews before I decided to buy it. I knew it was lukewarm leftovers before I decided to spend the $$. Not much substance to it as an expansion pack. However, it was a ""gift"" for getting excellent grades in school."
5,love this game!!!!!,"I absolutely love this game and i purchase all the EP's and the ""stuff"" packs as well."
1,Dinosaurs Unearthed,If you like to watch the same thing over and over and over again this is the dvd for you. I was very disappointed in this dvd. Not a lot of new information. Nova has much better dvd's on Dinosaurs.
2,I don't want Male Pattern Baldness at my age.,"Many may consider the lemmings series a revolutionary puzzle game. In some ways it is, you take a species of morons and guide them threw an underground world of blood curdling traps. However after the first 5 puzzles you will literally start ripping your hair out in frustration. YOu will be cursing day in and day out if you even attempt to beat this. The variouse difficulties don't help either.To maek matters worse there are no Gameshark Codes, or cheat codes in general for this, maybe thats because no one ever beat this damn thing.I would rent this if you want to relive some good old lemmings fun, but if you have never tried this than don't bother, you will just rip your hair out."
1,The Zenith VCS442 is a Lemon,"He purchase 30 of these for classroom use. Most of them are having the same problem. What appears to be a bad tracking problem is in fact a bad solder joint or connection. Sorry LG/Zenith, you have lost us a customers next time around."
1,TERRIBLE,"THIS PRODUCT IS ALREADY DISPLAYING PROBLEMS, WHICH PROBABLY MEAN THAT I WILL BE RETURNING IT SOON FOR A REPLACEMENT."
3,Not for renters--more for those who OWN their apartment,"I ordered this book based on the title, thinking that ""apartment"" referred to a rental space. I quickly discovered that the book was geared more for New York City residents who own their apartment. (That's what we'd call a condominium here on the West Coast.)If you're looking for a book on how to decorate an interior when you can't modify the paint color or structure, this book isn't it.That said, the ideas in this book are creative and colorful, and will certainly inspire many people...I just could not use many of these ideas in my rented space."
5,"It has Aquinas, it HAS to be good!","This very short book gives some of the most essential philosophical passages (as selected and footnoted by Kreeft) of St. Thomas Aquinas' Summa Theologica.For anyone who wishes to delve into Aquinas, but does not feel able to tackle the material by itself or even to try Kreeft's much longer ""Summa of the Summa,"" then this book is perfect.""A Shorter Summa"" allows you to stick you big toe in to test the water of Thomistic thought. No doubt you will find it to your liking, and wish to dive head-first into first-hand Aquinas with no footnotes!"
1,you get what you pay for,The price was too good to be true - the beads were such poor quality - however the glass bead bundle was worth the price - get your metal somewhere else.
2,Get Component cable if you can,"I've been using the S-Video cable for my PS1 AND DC for years, however, not with the new PS2 system. If you can find one, and your TV is set up for it, get the ""Component cable"". Price difference is minimal ($10 +/-).Here's the key, DVD format for recording and decoding to and from the disc, set by the powers that be, is Component video. It actualy sepeates the color fields, and they are processed seperately. Whereas S-Vid just seperates color and light values (in lay-mans term nutshell). Component gives MUCH higher resolution.Only problem is most TV's w/ Component inputs are projection, and well, just read your instructions, and they usually say video games on projection TVs are a no-no...(BURN IN). The choice, if you have one, is yours, but I know where my money goes from here on in."
2,What Jesus Would Eat?,"Dr. Colbert does a reasonable job in describing his own belief system on dieting. However, this book is not new information from the other books that Dr. Colbert has written. It also does not follow the biblical descriptions of food allowable in the New Testament. Dr. Colbert does not take into account the modern improvements of handling meats, poultry and fish of all types since Jesus walked on the earth. Most of the world's catfish and shrimp are now raised in ponds on farms being fed meal each day. These types of oversights weakens his book and his repeated message. I was wishing that it would have been more creative and offered something new other than fasting and eating bread without yeast."
4,Eating Smart was easier when there were not MCD's!,"This is a book that makes you think about what you are eating and how your body is really doing when being fed all the junk we eat. I enjoy this book and like Toxic Releif a lot too. These books are great if you want to change your eating style and focus on what you are doing to your body by eating the stuff we call ""a normal American diet."""
4,Good book for eating principles.,I really like this book. It's very thorough regarding the subject and I actually learned some things. Try this one!
3,Good Diet Option,"The author pushes for a Mediterranean diet based on Levitical dietary laws and the traditional foods eaten in 1st century Israel. Some of the examples seem to be a bit of a stretch, but overall some very sound nutritional advice. Quite a bit of time is spent on wine in the diet. The author believes red wine should be included in people's diet up to 8 ounces a day."
2,A disappointment...,"MISSING from this CD is the score for what is perhaps the movie's climax: Scarecrow's potential homerun snatched out of the air by Mickey Hart.I haven't been this disappointed in a score since Luke's-hand-being-chopped-off was left off ""The Empire Strikes Back.""Who makes these decisions?"
4,"Great hard drive, software is another issue","I was pleased to get the LaCie F.A. Porsche 320gb external hard drive for under $100. I plugged it in, the usb cord was included, and it came up just fine on my computer. My only problem came when I actually tried to use the back-up software included. The software isn't worth the disc it was burned onto. It kept telling me I didn't have enough room on the hard drive to back-up. Considering the Lacie hard drive is 4 times larger than my computer's hard drive that was not even an option. I reformatted to see if it just wasn't recognizing the space and that didn't help either. I gave up on the software, backed up through Sonic and had no problem.I would buy the hard drive again and definitely recommend it to others (especially if you get the under $100 deal), but don't bother unpacking the software."
4,superb drive,I've had this product for a month. It has been fast and reliable. My only complain (reason for 4 stars) is the loosyconnections. Both data and power cables had a loose fit even when tried for the first time.
1,Unreliable!,"We purchased LaCie to back up photo material. After only four months, with gentle use, the drive quit functioning and made a beeping noise. I called the company, they were very familiar with the problem and said the drive is broken and cannot be repaired. Also, the warranty does not cover data recovery, and has stipulations regarding where one can have their data recovered without compromising the warranty. What a disappointment."
1,Bummer Drive,"This drive died on me way too soon. I would not recommend a LaCie. They don't give good online support, they recommend you download expensive software to fix the problems."
4,Good product,"It's quiet and has lots of room for storage. It's not a mini external drive, but it is small, compact and not too heavy to carry around if needed."
2,A Poor Selection,I had a HPLaserJet 4M for over 10 years and I was so very happy with it that when I decided to get a color laser I also thought this one would be great. My complaints are basically that it is a very very very expensive printer to keep running. Color cartidges are about $70 each so I figure that I could throw the unit away and buy another for the cost of replacing all the cartriges. Also it is really slow even after the first page prints. Interestingly too it seems to run a cycle through check every once in a while like it is trying to reestablish its IP connection. The printer also likes to jam paper and this is really frustrating if you are trying to print out a 10 page document and it jams every other page. I don't recommend this printer regardless of price.
3,Little pocket map of Paris,"This is a good ""all in one place"" look at Paris but the ""Paris Par Arrondissments"" has ALL the streets and is the way to find the little streets and alleys."
5,Love this Toaster!,I've been looking for a toaster/toaster oven combo for a long time...this one is perfect. It works great and is very resonably priced!
1,Burns everything,"I can't believe this item has good reviews. It has burned everything I have tried in the oven, and the toaster part doesn't work well either. It takes too long to toast a piece of bread, and sometimes requires two tries. It is pathetic."
4,Great little oven/toaster,"This is a great toaster/oven if you dont want to heat up large meals. The bagel toaster on top is great. Toasts in 2-3 min. The oven is a bit small, but it does fit a slice of pizza. If you only want to heat up some snacks and toast bread and bagels, get this!"
2,Oven function dies,"I really liked this Toastation because it didn't take up much space, could toast long slices of bread and heated food up fast. However, now that I've had it for 7 months, the oven part is no longer working. The elements still heat up in the toaster mode, because I can make toast, but there must be a problem with the oven switch. In the oven mode, the elements don't heat up. I have a second Toastation with the same problem and have discovered that other people have had the same experience. There's a design flaw, so beware."
5,HB Toaststation,This is the second toaststation that I have purchased. The prior toaststation was 10 years old (same brand). I was then as I am now extremely pleased with its functionality and would recommend this product. I was pleasently surprised to see that Amazon offered this product. I have ordered several items from them and have never disappointed with any products purchased through them.
2,"Good toaster, NOT so good toaster oven","I had this toaster oven for about a year and wished I hadn't. It toasts well, but the toaster oven burns quickly because of the height of the oven, or lack thereof. It's also impossible to clean well. There needs to be someway to get rid of the toast crumbs, which fall down into the oven as the bottom doesn't swing open or slide out. Very anoying! It went into the yard sale pile the spring after buying it."
4,Hamilton Beach 22708 Toastation Toaster,Its good as in it does whats required but the toasts get stuck in the slots and sometimes its difficult to remove.Otherwise the size is very right for small kitchensand it does its work.
3,No timer for mini oven!,"I was looking for someting compact that combined a popup toaster with a mini oven. This was ALMOST perfect until I realized there is no timer shutoff for the mini oven. This may not be a big deal for many of you -- maybe you're ok using a standalone kitchen timer, etc. But I'm one of those guys who will put something in the microwave and forget about it for so long it's cold again. So, I'm looking for a replacement.Just something to keep in mind. Other than that -- great price and a great compact dual function design."
4,Toaster and Mini Oven,Purchased for work and everyone seems to like it having a separate toaster keeps people from burning the toast. And they can heat up lunch for stuff you don't want to mico wave
5,Best toaster oven. Period!,"From toasting a bagel or two slices of bread, to reheating a pizza slice or toasting your favorite sub... Every bread crumb is catch by the pan in the bottom and its so easy to clean. Has a cancel button for a perfect toast."
2,Not so great.,"We had been using Black and Decker toaster ovens for years. They worked well, but didn't seem ideal for making toast and I went back and forth about whether to switch to a regular toaster and just use my big oven for warming leftovers and fries, etc. The Toastation has not been the perfect compromise I had hoped for-it's a pain to get your toast out before the toasting cycle is finished, it doesn't make particularly good toast, and the oven is too small for anything thicker than a slice of pizza. Last night I tried to warm up a piece of fried chicken and it didn't come close to fitting in there. It is kind of cool-looking and appears to be well-made, but the thing seems sort of gimmicky."
1,Steer Clear of this toaster,"I found this listing on Amazon because I am browsing for another toaster. I bought this toaster at a local store a year ago. It was trouble from day one.There is no dedicated off switch. The sliding switch that controls the top opening works to turn the main oven on and off. If you are using it to toast bread up right you cannot shut it off. You have to unplug it or force the mechanism up to release the bread, which usually results in flinging the bread onto the counter, sink, or whatever you have near it. The crumb tray catches some crumbs, but most fall around it and and into the bottom of the toaster.The rack itself pulls out with the door, but when you go to close it you need to puch it in a little by hand to make it catch on the door mechanism, this is tricky with a hot oven.Currently mine smokes so bad everytime I use it I have to open up the windows to clear the house out. I am fed up with the toaster and will be buying something else."
3,Very Mini oven,"Spouse loves the toaster part, Oven part is awfully small, but works fairly well. We use in our RV and its a real space saver, so its a good buy we feel."
1,Toaster- oven,This item is too small to be a toaster and an oven. It needs to be made larger. I thought the space saver would be great but boy was I wrong. Do not buy!
3,the concept is great,"but we miss having a larger oven and sometimes you want to ""toast' something while it is flat, so we have to live with that."
4,Nice combo,I like the versitiity of this toaster/oven. It serves it purposed very wiil. My kids like it and it is easy to operate.
4,Kitchen,"Great little toaster oven. Well made, the only problem is toasting two large pieces of bread. It is a little tight. If the top opening was just a inch longer it would be fine. Everything else is OK. I still would recommend this product! Johan"
2,Sad Little Toaster,"This is a sad little toaster. It doesn't do any of the functions that it was designed to do well. I like the idea of combining a toaster with a toaster oven; it makes sense. Unfortunately, this design needs improving.The toasting function: The surface that the bread stands on while it is toasting is very narrow, so it often slides to one side which means it gets caught when it is ejecting. If it is seated properly, it is ejected with such force I have had toast come out of the toaster. According to the owner's manual, you ought to be able to interrupt a toasting cycle by just lifting up the same lever you use to push the bread down. My unit never worked from day one.As a toaster oven this unit did not heat evenly for me."
1,"Do not buy, for the love of Toast!","How do I hate thee, let me count the ways:Hardly fits 2 slices of toast-- you have to overlap them a little to get both in.Sometimes toast burnd when the knob is set to 3, other times it comes out barely toasted when knob is set to 6It seems the only way to cancel a toasting cycle and force your burnt-to-a-crisp slices of toasts out of the unit is to slide the oven door shut. I.e. you are forcing your toast up into a closed hatch. If they don't crumble completely they tops get bent over at bestThe ""oven"" part of this is so small you really can't do much of anything in there."
4,small kitchen asset,"In a small NYC kitchen the Hamilton Beach Toastation is a must. With just one appliance needing limited counter space you can toast, warm and bake.Easy to use and easy to clean"
5,why even consider a different toaster? ;),"I bought this toaster, the larger version with 2 slots for 4 slices of bread/bagel halves, for my parents last year for Christmas and loved it so much I had to get one for myself! We received one for Christmas this year and I am happy with it, but I do wish we had the larger one. For more than a single person household, it makes much more sense to be able to toast 4 slices of bread at once, to be able to heat more than one piece of pizza, etc. This oven is very small, compact, good for a single person, small apartment, or college dorm, but if you are a 2 person or more household I suggest the larger version. the only plus is it does take up less space on our counter..."
2,"Great size, that's about it","I bought this several years ago, because of the size. Most Toaster ovens are just ridiculously huge. That being said it doesn't toast that great with the toaster part. My english muffins would always slide down and get stuck. So now I just toast in the oven, but I have to watch it so it doesn't burn. I usually have to flip it over and toast the other side because it doesn't toast evenly. Three stars because in the end I still have toast, and it's not too big. 5/1/11 - Decided to change it to 2 stars. I stopped using the toaster function 2 years ago as it was so bad, and toasted in the oven. Well now the lever you have to slide over to engage the oven is no longer working. The toaster part works in theory but not reality...I finally get to say good-bye to it."
1,Hamilton Beach toaster/oven,"I was excited to see a toaster and oven combination as my counter space is limited, however, I was disappointed when I got the unit.It is quite flimsy and tinny....the oven portion of the unit is too small to conveniently heat up even the smallest items and the toaster portion has a very tight spring so when the toast is done it flips up and ou with intensity...guess I am back so looking for a toaster/oven without the toaster and a bigger oven portion. I ordered this item from Amazon and it was delivered fast and in great condition."
3,"Great idea, okay execution.","Pros: It toasts really fast--2 minutes--better than any other toaster oven. It has a small footprint.Major con: Breads do not go in deep enough. The tops of my normal-sized bread slices were sticking out. When the toast was done, the top portions were soft and untoasted."
4,Great with a couple quirks,"I really like this toaster with exception of the tray in the oven. It does not slide into the oven very easily, it seems slightly too big. Also, items tend to be too close to the burners. For example burritos often burn on top.It toasts much better than other toaster ovens."
4,A very good toaster,"It makes great toast...nice and even. I havem't used the oven feature yet, but I like that I have it if I need it without having to have a huge one taking up space on my counter top. You can't cook a turkey in it, but then why would I ever want to cook a turkey in a toaster oven?"
4,Amazon's Hamilton Beach Toastation,"We think it is great. It is a combination of a toaster and a small oven. Toaster holds various bread items, bread, english muffins, bagels and the oven is great for making toasted cheese sandwiches and warming up pizza slices, and heating up those left-over potato sticks or other small items. The microwave heats food, but leaves them limp and soggy, where this toaster-oven heats and crisps items.It is smaller than most toaster-ovens and thus takes up less space on kitchen counters (and we don't like cluttered counters)"
1,Deeply flawed design,"This works as neither toaster nor oven. First of all, the toaster fits only small slices of bread, and those it toasts unevenly. Any normal size slice sticks out the top, and that part doesn't toast at all (except the part inside the toaster, which has toasted unevenly).The oven burns the top of whatever you put in, while the bottom isn't cooked at all. Another reviewer mentioned you can correct this problem by placing something heat-proof above the toaster while using the oven to prevent the upper heating element from staying on. This actually does help somewhat. But seriously!!!! Do you really want to go to all that trouble, when you are just trying to heat something up quickly?The fact that you need this elaborate work-around in order not to burn the top of your food just shows that this product was not tested by Hamilton Beach prior to being manufactured."
5,Toastation Toaster,I really like the dual purpose of the Toastation. Both the toaster and the oven work great and frees up my countertop.
4,Space saver combo,Bread toasts are good as they are not evenly toasted because the heating element is not spread out like a regular toaster.The oven also does its job. I gets hot really quickly compared to full size kitchen oven.I liked it for its price and saves space on my kitchen counter. It lacks a timer for the oven Overall I am satisfied with it.
1,Not What it's Cracked Up To Be!,"What a disappointment! The concept is great, but the fact is that the ""Toastation"" is neither a good toaster nor a good oven. It takes forever to heat. Toast always requires a second time. If you NEED it to pop up, it is very hard to release and causes the toast to fly out of the slots like an old comedy movie. And the oven.... well, it is just useless It doesn't stay hot enough to do the job, which means that it takes so long that you'll forget you have anything in there. And there's no timer to stop it when you do forget! Also, it does not broil and the grooves in the top are just a trap for crumbs. Unless you have lots of time on your hands and like to monitor an inefficient appliance, forget this one. Buy a less expensive and more functional toaster oven."
4,Works great - very compact and looks great,I really like not having to have 2 separate appliances. It has a small foot print and works great. Although some have complained that the toaster oven part is very small - would only fit about 1 large slice of pizza at a time. The grey metallic part isn't stainless steel - some kind of cheap faux metal grey paint. Other than that I love the 2-in-1 space savings.
4,Almost perfect,"All in all we are very pleased with the toaster oven. Its major flaw is that in the toaster mode, the sides of the toaster cage don't clamp down on the toast. This can result in the toast literally falling between the cracks and getting stuck half in and half out of the toaster, requiring you to either rip the slice apart or risk burning your fingers by reaching in the through the oven door with the toaster pushed all the way down to retrieve the escaped slice. This doesn't happen often, but can be quite annoying.As others have said, I would like to see a timer on the oven with a shutoff, but that is for future planning.I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a toaster/oven with a small foot print, and I would buy his product again."
2,"Not a good toaster, Not a good oven",Purchased this toaster oven about a year ago. The bread falls through and burns or gets stuck and falls apart. Oven is so small it doesn't warm up a slice of pizza without burning the top. Would not recommend trying to get two appliances in one. Now I have to purchase a toaster as well as a toaster oven separately. Oven tray quality is bad - hard to clean and toaster is worthless. I have to keep reminding myself - nothing for nothing especially in todays market.
4,Like it!,I've only used it a handfull of times but so far so good - it's a great size and serves it's function well!
3,"Great idea, in theory","We've had this combo for a few years and while it's cute and doesn't take up much room, it doesn't toast very well. Often, toast will slip through to the oven and either burn or just make more of a mess. The toast doesn't toast evenly, the bottom part burns and the top part barely toasts."
2,Not a great toaster or an oven,"I've had this toaster for a few years and it has been just ok at both toasting and oven cooking. Recently it has begun to shock you when you touch the handle when it is on. The handle is metal, but there should be some safeguard to prevent this. I'm looking for a different brand, and am considering myself lucky that it didn't happen to one of my children."
1,Good idea - poor execution,"My primary complaint is that it takes so much force to release the pop-up toaster (requires two hands) that the toast flies out. Frozen waffles usually sag into a ""C"" shape and often jam. The oven works ok but required a little bending of the rack support so that the baking pan would not jam the door. The toaster is unsatisfactory. We tried it for 2 weeks and put it back in the box."
5,Great toaster oven,"I got this toaster oven as a Christmas present and I am very happy with it. I have used it for toast, frozen waffles, reheating leftovers, etc. and it has performed well each time. I wanted a toaster oven but didn't have the counter space for it and my toaster - this was the perfect solution."
4,Easy and Compact,"With limited counter space, I was looking for a toaster oven that could do both and not take up alot of space.I found this item to be the best of both worlds."
2,Not for me,"I have never been able to get the toaster oven to work well for me. I find it frequntly burning things. I have had others in the past that I didn't have this problem with. I got this one because of the toaster and oven combo, but in the end I only use it for the toaster."
5,better than before,This toaster has new feature that allows you to stop the toaster before the selected time.
4,toastation,the whole family loves this replacement of our old toaster over -- the oven capacity is clearly limited but it's wonderful to have the combination toaster feature
4,Very good toaster but...,"This toaster is a very good toaster. It does have its flaws though.-The tray that fits inside is a tight fit. So much so that the door sometimes does not want to close unless the tray is positioned perfectly.-The top burners when toasting horizontally toast better than the bottom burners.-Lastly, the way the tray fits in the oven allows for crumbs to constantly dump out of the bottom of the door where it connects to the unit.These flaws are probably personal preferences but to me, still aggravating. Very good toaster, with design flaws."
5,Best Toaster Oven I have used,"This is the second toaster oven I have owned. The first toaster oven was the same one. After 3 years of use, using it about 5-6 times a day, it finally gave out. This works great for bagels and the cancel button works great. The previous model of this product did not have the cancel button and its a great addition."
3,VERY disappointed at the lack of lesbian stories.,"Otherwise it was pretty good.The second volume had more lesbian stories in it, but still rather lacking. I wish the ratio of lesbian stories to hetero stories was more equal."
3,WORTH IT!,"The last time I played this game was in the '90s when I was about 5 (oh, i think 1998 is when it was released. Yay to my guessing skills!). Anyway, I remember my sisters and I having a blast with it when we were younger, but now that I look back on it, it was simply the minds of little girls who were infatuated with the Spice Girls group to not see any negativity about any of them or their products. Reading the review from Andy Deemer up above reminded me of what the game was really about and I agree 100%. BUT, all that being said, I am STILL going to buy the game because it has a positive special place in my childhood memory and I am sure my sisters will be totally surprised and ecstatic that I bought it, play it once all the way through (like old times), then put it up and probably never play it again. It is going to be SO worth it! =^_^="
3,Cute Costume but Fabric seems fragile,"Nice cute costume, but the fabric seems very fragile especially if it got stuck onto finger nails, there's be a pull in the threads.Nonetheless, it's cuteness makes up for it."
4,"Good product, small, light, strong and inexpensive","This product compares favorably to similar products like the two AM Leonard Handy weeders, the 5"" version and the Forged Handy Weeder (18""). For one, it is inexpensive and virtually indestructible. While I generally like the longer handles versions better, this product is different than competing tools because it is all aluminum, lightweight and has a smaller head so you can weed between plants better.The 45 degree angle of the cutting surface is ideal and better for general use than the cape cod weeder which is angled at a 90 degree angle. (The Cape Cod weeder is a better tool for grouting or edging though). I bought two and added a longer handle to one with PVC Pipe and clamps. Now it has a 24 inch handle and can be without stooping over or forward and injuring my back (a common problem with virtually all short-handled, hand tools)- Jeffrey Restuccio, Author, Get Fit Through Gardening"
4,Chilling Background Music,Even though the film wasn't great this is an excellent soundtrack to put on if you feel like ready a scary novel by candlelight.
3,Donald D Davis,"Jessica from Birmingham, Alabama you said a VERY strange thing in your review, you said: ""This soundtrack is actually very good...considering that it is basically just music. "" What does that mean ""considering that it's basically just music""? What do you expect form a soundtrack, most times you'll get basically just music."

3,Jancis Robinson's Wine Course,This DVD is seriously outdated for the person studying wine at a professional level. Some of the interviews with winemakers are embarrassingly old.
5,Girls like it!,"Every girl I have showed this game to (no I didn't show it to my mom, or yours) has without exception been fascinated by it and thoroughly enjoyed playing it. Need I say more?"
5,excellent reference,This text is clearly the authority of ocular pathology disease reference. It is definitely an asset to any ocular health professional's personal library. It is rich in photographs and rich didactic text.
4,who says christian deathmetal is not good!,"mortification rocks and roll, the music is so heavy that it will literally blow your big or little head clear off with one listen! Buy this one you wo'nt be sorry !"
3,Wide Size Issue,"Just purchased my second set of these boots. I love them, but this pair has the same issue as the first pair. I wear a wide size. The left boot is more narrow than the right. I don't have this issue with any other set of boots so it's not that my left foot is wider than my right. It takes a month or two to stretch out depending on how much you wear them. It's very annoying until then. I've have a friend at work that wears these same boots as well, and he has the same issue. They will widen out but it's a big pain until they do."
3,Helped a little; not a lot,"I had silicone caulking (the stuff that feels like gummy bears) and it did help to break the bond between the caulking and the tile, but it was still a lot of work with a razor scraper to get it all. Maybe my expectations were too high. Without it, I'd probably still be in the shower scraping the caulk out while the shower head dripped down on me (should have fixed that first!). So, it was worth the price, but don't expect miracles. You MAY get lucky and have an incredibly good experience like some reviewers did. Or not."
4,Works as advertised,"I used this for removing 4 year old silicone caulk in my shower. I applied it over the caulk sealing the tile to the enclosure frame and came back several hours later to find the caulk soft and very easy to remove. I later applied it over the caulk sealing the base of the shower to the walls. Both surfaces were tiled. I came back about 3 hours later and found the caulk to still be hard in places. I would recommend this product, but would also recommend that you wait longer than the time specified in the directions."
1,DID NOT WORK ON SILICONE,"Applied heavy amount to a strip of clear silicon caulk at the bottom of a window let stand 24 hours,silicone hard as a rock, applied second very heavy coat let stand another 24 hours silicone still hard as a rock..."
2,Pretty bad damage potential,"In the instructions it says to remove from painted surfaces and wallpaper promptly. Also says that remover may affect some plastic surfaces. I guess that that's fair warning. I was removing some hard as rock silicone/acrylic caulk from around my bathtub. The 3M stuff softened it up a fair amount but I still had to apply five times, sometimes leaving the stuff on overnight. As I was cleaning up after a couple of days, I found that where caulk remover had dripped and stayed on the fiberglass tub (Jacuzzi Whirlpool), it had etched out chunks of the finish. Looks pretty bad, big scars on the edges of the tub. Might be o.k. if you're careful enough, wasn't worth it to me."
2,Heard it...,This is A RIPOFF only buy it if you dont have any oingo boingo albums. The packaging is ok but don't expect any rare recordings.
4,5 stars for disc one; 3 stars for disc two,"I'm not sure how they managed to put so many great songs on one disc and such (relative) lemons on the other disc. I'm glad I got this release... it's definitely a great remastering job and has some of my favorites like ""Ain't this the life"" (though the one on URGH! was better), ""Grey Matter"", ""Private Life"", ""Who do you want to be?"" (I definitely wore out my vinyl of ""Good for Your Soul"").I saw them play in 1981 or so and have recently thought it's a shame they don't perform anymore. Though, Danny Elfman has certainly found great success doing something he obviously loves. It's sort of funny how 80s-sounding some of the stuff on this release sounds. It doesn't make me cringe (like some 80s music)--but I can't quite put my finger on what makes it sound so dated. I mean, it's great and all but be prepared to recognize telltale signs of a generation of music. (Keyboard, drum machine, guitar techniques?)"
5,Fit perfectly,The rack fit perfectly. Purchased it for my daughter and had it shipped directly to her. The entire purchase was great.
2,Where were these reviews when I bought this camera?,"Like everyone else here- I thought there was something wrong- but, no. Batteries last about 8 minutes or 5 shots. Ridiculous and annoying. You can't see the LCD when you're outside so you can't tell whether it's on or not. (Usually it's run out of juice.) That being said- it takes beautiful pictures. But I would not buy it again."
2,What do you expect for $20?,"If you buy this camera be aware that there are no longer drivers available for this camera. So if you're buying this camera and there is no disk (drivers) that comes with the camera (mine didn't) there are NO drivers available anywhere on the internet to download. So the solution? You need a to buy a removable 'memory card' for it. No problem, right? Wrong. The amount of memory this camera will accept cannot exceed 36mgs... and ALL new memory cards start at 'gigs'. So you have to buy you memory card on the 'net' and they are QUITE a bit more than the newer 'gig' cards. So the great deal on the camera you bought just doubled because of the memory card. (In fact I paid more for the memory card than I did for the camera)"
4,I know it's supposed to be a kids book...,"...but it's a ton of fun for an adult like me. Fun, fresh, and even surreal, ""First"" teaches readers (especially youth) not just to enjoy reading but also to question what we see and read. Recommended!"
2,Not recommended,"I would not recommend this game. The main task seems to be using the game controller; identifying the numbers (all single-digit, I believe) is very easy for any kid old enough to even minimally use the controller. Also, you can't turn around, which my son finds very frustrating. Additionally, it seems to give you the same few numbers over and over."
5,Love this pan!,I've had this pan for a year and use it all the time. Because I use it so often I bought another for a Christmas gift...so many uses.
2,Poor design,This is the second adapter I have had to buy for $60. The wire inside the cord eventually wears and breaks. Be very careful folding it at all if you take it places. I wish it were sturdier. And with Dell you have to get their type of plug. So they've got me. I will have to get another if it breaks again which I'm sure it will if I use it for a year. I won't get another Dell computer. The cooling fan is under the computer so it always overheats and shuts itself off. I have to prop it up with a pencil or something on the side. Poor design. The cooling fan should be on the side. And theres no volume adjuster on the computer. YOu have to adjust by opening the volume window in windows. Very annoying if you have to turn the volume down quickly theres no quick way around it.
2,is it new or used?,"it disconnects power while in use!? you'll need to ""wiggle"" the cord to make the wires ""connect""this is the first time I buy from this provider, and the last. It was advertised as ""new"" product."
4,"Morning Beauty, Midnight Beast","A dark suspense about dark and lonely life on the Chicago streets. Two main characters, Molly running from an abusive relationship and Seth dealing with his own demons. Storyline brings these two together one dark night when Molly goes into labor and Seth rescues her and takes her to the hospital.Seth's character is strong.....he is and was the caretaker of his sister Shannon who has also led an incredibly ""dark"" life on the streets.MacKenzie brings all of these characters together and somehow all end up with happily everafter which at one moment in the book I doubted would happen.I liked the book and would recommend it to those who read romance/suspense.A different read from the other MacKenzie books I have purchased i.e. Billionaire Bachelor Auction, etc."
4,Solid Effort,"I like this CD. Although it is not as good as ""More..."" (his sophomore effort), there is really not too much to complain about. I have all of his previous work, and this one fits nicely into that collection."
4,A Handy Item but somewhat overpriced,"Firstly, I have to say that purchasing the Nespresso Aeroccino was an ""impluse buy"" on my part; I hadn't reviewed or researched the Aeroccino prior to purchasing it from Williams-Sonoma.However, now that I am using it on a regular basis, I am pleased enough (to date) with its performance.It's a bit disappointing that only enough froth is made for one coffee. The froth that is produced is good; especially for my cappuccinos. The Aeroccino also looks quite stylish on counter tops. However, clean up (while simple enough) requires a bit more care so that water is not spilled on the under side of the unit.The major downside is the price. I am of the view that $99.99 is too expensive."
2,owner concern,"I loved this product for months. It just stopped working. The manufacturer gave me helpfull ideas to make it work, but that only lasted a short while. I'm onto another brand."
2,Disapointing,"I really wanted one of these for Christmas and I was so excited when i got one from my grandma. but when i opened and started playing with it, i was disapointed. i dont have a regular tama but my friends do, and you couldnt do everything you could on a real one. all you could do is take care of it. save your money."
1,DISAPPOINTING,"I guess my expectations are too high. This book was very remedial with a lack of content. I was hoping to gain some insight from this book, but the information was basic at the best, with poor choices for athletes. No regard to the biomechanics of resistance training were applied, and no effort to address the neural or physiological continuums that are extremely important to athletic development. The one bright spot is the section on the court drills. They are enough to get you started on agility and foot speed drills."
3,For PS1,"Would have rated this a 5 Star, but it is for a PS1. PS1 is old tech and the graphics are poor."
3,"Poor start, Good finish",Purchased this gun because I have other Senco tools that have worked very well for me. It was used for small projects until recently. I needed to put up 35 squares on a rental property and started out with generic coils. Didn't have any problems bending nails but would not feed properly. Half way through the project I switched to Bostitch coils and gun worked fine with very few misfeeds. We kept the feeding spring assembly lubed which I think also helped. Had a Bostitch nailer on the job which also misfed on occasion. This may not be a professional quality nailer but for general use it's ok.
1,Buy a Hitachi instead,"I bought this item at Home Depot thinking that it would work for the few roofs (1-5) that I re-shingle throughout the year. After one roof I got a refund and purchased a Hitachi instead. This nailer gave me nothing but problems from nail depth to air leakage issues. I suppose if you are doing one roof it would be ok, just don't expect for it to run flawlessly and you will probably want to return it after a roofing job. It should be also noted that this model doesn't have the conular nail driving that I have heard works well."
5,It's Great!,"""Murder on the Titanic"" was so interesting that I could not put it down. The story was quick-moving, the characters believable (unlike in ""Titanic""--the film), and it was unbelievably graphic. Especially the sinking, which left goosebumps on my arms. If you don't mind some of the violence, this is the book to read."
4,What a GREAT read!,"In my oh-so humble opinion, this is one of the best books I've read this year! Walker's writing style and charactor development are in a word - fantastic. The only slight negative about the book, again in my oh-so humble opinion, is the ending. I can't say much about it without giving it away, but let's just say it finished a little too unrealistic. But all in all, a wonderful book and well worth you're time!"
1,"Great cooker, lousy insert quality & replacement process","This could be a fine unit if the ceramic crock did not crack after a few uses (as reported MANY times on this site). I have been trying to get a replacement crock since December 28, 2009 and have been told three times now that the crock will be available in 3-4 weeks. We are now into April 2010 and still no crock and no indication when, or if, it will ever arrive. This IS a ""crock"" in my opinion and I highly recommend that other slow cooker brands be considered over the All-Clad model due to their exceedingly poor record of product support. No matter how elegant the design of the cooker itself might be, it is useless without the crock to cook the meal in."
1,All-Clad 99009 Stainless-Steel 6-1/2-Quart Slow Cooker,This is the worst crock pot I have ever used. I gave over 300.00 for mine 2 yrs ago. I used it maybe 1 time every two months. I used it last week and it jut quit working. I won't buy this brand again from amazon. I really think they sell seconds.
1,So not worth the price,"I bought this all clad crock pot because I love all clad's cookware. I loved that I could program the start of the cooking and the total cook time. What i did not expect was for it to just stop working after about 20 uses. It was dead as a doornail with $15 worth of organic chicken in it that I had to throw out. Everything lit up, it just never got warm enough to actually cook anything. Incredibly disappointing!"
2,Broke after 4 uses,"Not happy at all with this item. Purchased in April (8 months ago) and used only 4 times. But now the 'set' button does not work. Ridiculous that this broke so quickly. If I had my druthers, I would return it and get my money back. However, as that is not an option, I will pay for S&H to return to the manufacturer for repairs. Ugh."
2,bubbling & peeling,I have had the slow cooker for about 2 years and the Teflon coating is bubbling and peeling off. I have been careful with the utencils that I use. I would not buy this unit again because of the defective insert.
1,Don't buy garbage,This is an expensive piece of garbage. The ceramic liner cracks easily. Had it less than 30 days before it cracked. No mishandling. Replacement liners aren't available. All-Clad doesn't have them (they'll call me if and when they become available). For this much money you'd expect quality. My old Crockpot never cracked. And I had it for 20 years. This was supposed to be an upgrade. Instead I wasted my money. Don't you do the same.
1,Cheap! Made in China! Didn't Last!,I have many All Clad products and was shocked at how cheaply made this product is. The pot cracked after 3 months and All Clad would not Warranty it. I paid a premium price for this product expecting that it was Made in the USA. This piece of junk is made in China. I'm dissapointed in All Clad and will be looking for another company to replace this product.
1,Disappointed,"I received this for a Christmas gift from my husband in 09. Used it a few times the first year. Insert broke in my sink while washing. So bummed, but liked the crock and so ordered another ($50 plus shipping). Within a few months, the electric panel, where you set the time, temp etc, started not coming on at first touch, and in a few weeks went totally dead. So I spent 179 for the crock, plus about 70 for replacements insert, to have it die. Since it was past a year of course all clad would do nothing. This is ridiculous for something that cost this much!!! My ""old faithful"" rival crockpot with manual on/off knob works fine after 16 years.Absolutely do not spend so much on this item!!!"
1,An expensive dud,"My kids splurged and bought me the fancy metal insert slow cooker from All Clad three years ago. Price after tax was close to $300. Not a cheap gift. The product has had very little use over the last three years and when I recently tried to cook with it, the heating element failed. When I called the All Clad customer service I was told ""Too bad, warranty is only one year"" They offered to let me send it to someone to have it repaired... at my cost. I intend to ditch this turkey and spend my money to buy another brand of slow cooker."
1,A great way to grow your landfill,"This thing absolutely will break on you before too long. If not today, just wait a month. Please do some research on this slow cooker before you buy. There are many, many reviews online of this slow cooker that detail problems with the electronics. I used it about 5 times before the electronics broke on me. Now it is completely dead."
1,horrible slow cooker,This slow cooker was so much more expensive than the other brands that I thought it would last longer than a year. The whole inside is bubbled up and peeling off. Do not waste your money on this item.
1,Defective control buttons,"I purchased my All-Clad Slow Cooker in September of 2007. I was very pleased with it and at that time felt it was worth the money. I used it through the winter months, then didn't use it again until this fall(2008). When I tried to turn it on, the digital read out would not fully come on. I feared it was shorting out but after about 10 minutes, it began to function. Unfortunately, the next time I tried, it would not turn on at all. I have passed the 1 year warranty time period but will try to call customer service after the Thanksgiving holidays. I'm not sure if they will help me and I feel for the cost of the cooker, one year of use is very unfair."
1,"It's a Cracked Pot, not a Crock Pot","I've got loads of All-clad cooking pots and pans. I love them. When my college-era Rival Crock pot died though, I wept. Naturally, I went to All-clad, expecting greatness. I used it frequently and babied it. Though it was a bit on the hot side, and the lid didn't seal allowing some things to dry out, I was happy enough until I noticed a crack developing. Then I started reading about MANY others with the same problem, and their general difficulties getting it replaced. Like me, many reported disbelief and horrible customer service. Less than 2 years out, and this expensive slow cooker is cooked?All-clad does well with steel. They should just stay with what they do well. Don't spend your money on this unless you have money to throw away, and then you're probably not using a slow cooker at home anyway...."
1,Beware All-Clad Crock Pot,"I used my All-Clad crock pot for 8-10 times. I have had it for about 14 months. It was beautiful on the Holiday buffet table.You cannot imagine my disappointment when the pot would not turn on one morning. The LCD?? screen does not light. Fortunately, I had a $24 Rival Crock Pot that I transferred my food into.I love my All-Clad Pots and Pans but the All-Clad Crock Pot appears to have been a poor purchase."
1,"Wedding present, insert broke with in one year!","I've had several crock pots and they've all lasted except this one, the all clad slow cooker! I was excited to receive it as a wedding gift, but the insert got a crack in it within the first year! I didn't save receipts or warranty booklets. I never dropped the insert or put it in the dishwasher. Disappointed with this product. Will never buy another all clad slow cooker again. From reading other peoples reviews, it looks like I'm not alone. To order another insert from all clad it's almost $40 plus shipping. I hear they'll break agin. So, I'm going to cut my losses and switch to another brand."
1,Allclad No Cooker,"After using the unit 3 times, it died...did not go on....past the warranty not so I have a lovely flower pot. I would avoid this unit like the plague!"
1,Frustrated,"I bought my ALL-Clad a year ago. I loved it.. it is my first slow cooker and even got my husband to cook. I noticed from the beginning some leakage but didn't think anything of it until my husband found a crack in the insert while cleaning it last week. i have never put insert in dishwasher, on the stove, or used any heavy duty utensils. I have tried to contact All-clad via email with no response and have been put on hold endlessly on the phone.I think I have thrown away $200 plus dollars."
4,handle with care,"The cooker works like a charm, but be careful with the removable parts (glass lid and ceramic insert).The ceramic insert arrived shattered (amazon.com was incredibly efficient in quickly shipping a replacement). When the glass lid slipped out of my hand, hitting the kitchen floor, and shattering into hundreds of bits, a replacement-lid purchase direct from All-Clad was quite slow in coming.My bad luck, all, of course. But, the cooker works fine, even when covered w/ aluminum foil in place of the included glass lid."
1,What they don't tell you,What they don't tell you is that this doll is small....very small. It is not for a child but is a collectable. They don't tell you that either. They list it as for a certain age child but no little girl would want to play with this doll; it would be merely sitting on a shelf to look at. Not much fun.
2,"Okay, but doesn't cool like a 12,000 btu window unit","I purchased this a/c a few days ago to cool off our family room (approx. 140 sq feet) with adjoining kitchen (approx. 120 sq feet). The description says it can easily cool up to 400 sq feet; however, I think it falls extremely short. It was about 92 today (very hot for Seattle) and it took all day just to get below 80 degrees in these two rooms using this unit. My recommendation is to use this for only one room, not to exceed 200 sq feet, e.g. a bedroom or office. Don't believe the hype that a portable 12,000 btu unit can perform cooling comparable to a window unit. This one is probably very good for one room, but struggles terribly to cool over 200 sq feet. I do like the fact I don't have to empty the water."
4,Working Great,"I bought this product about a month ago and love it, no problems so far and it gets the job done. I like that it is small in size but don't let that fool you, it can cool a room just fine. I love that I have not had to empty any water from it either. I have it in my living room which is about 500 sq feet and it keeps the average temp in the room at about 71-74, just right. Good bang for the buck, I would say."
1,"A $500 fan, but not an air conditioner","My air conditioner is on full blast in my bedroom, set to 62 degrees. It's 80 degrees outside today... and 81 degrees in my room! This is the best it can do? It's basically a $500 fan, but not an air conditioner."
3,Works Reasonably Well,"Air conditioner was easy enough to assemble (didn't have any problems setting up the exhaust hose window attachment), but the air that comes out of the machine is NOT cold air - merely COOL air, no matter how high you set the controls. This is the first ever portable air conditioner I've bought, so I'm not sure if this is normal. I can only say that the air that comes out of the old window unit I had was a thousand times colder than the air that comes out of the NewAir. I bought this machine for an apartment that does not allow air-conditioners in the windows for liability reasons. If I ever had to buy another portable, I'd be tempted to try another manufacturer to see if their machine was capable of creating colder air than this one is."
4,"Good, effective unit.","I'm using this unit in a small room... ~200 square feet with 8 foot ceilings. On the hottest days, the temp has been upwards of 86 in this room, with pretty low humidity. It works very well and very quickly at dropping the temperature to about 72-73 and keeping it there. However, the compressor will shut off (presumably from icing) when it tries to go below that temp, regardless of the starting temperature. Fortunately, that's comfortable enough for me."
3,if this is quiet I'd hate to hear the loud ones.,"This unit worked great the first day, the next few the condenser wouldn't turn on despite setting it for a low temp. Today it is working again, but it is 98 outside & very humid so any cooling feels good. The description says it is quiet. It is like the old A/C wall units in cheap hotels, not quiet at all, even with the fan on low. I'm keeping it because I have health issues with the heat and must have A/C. The window vent is awkward, I had to cut styrofoam to get it to fit and stay in the window, I had to use tape and I hated to put it on the window frame. I'm giving it a 3 of 5 because it is portable, better than having to have multiple window units."
5,EXCELLENT CHOICE,"After getting quotes for A/C we opted for the inexpensive way out - portable units in five rooms. Total cost has been less than $2,300.00 (over five years) and our entire 3 bedroom passive solar house is well air conditioned! The latest portable A/C addition, NewAir AC-12000E is the best of the five we own for cold air output but is the loudest. If the sound of the fan (rather high pitched) is not a problem for you then I would strongly recommend this unit."
5,I LOVED IT.,"I Loved PRETENSE! It was awesome! Lori Wick makes you fall in love with her characters, and no doubt about it you fall in love with PRETENSE!! It made laugh and made me cry!! God has a powerful touch on Lori Wick and amazes me how powerful her words can be!! God can use anyone if you believe!! Lori Wick is one of my favorite author!!"
2,A little bit boring,"I read this book several years ago, and although I generally love to read and love Christian fiction, this was one book I had a hard time getting through. It really didn't have much of a plot, and the book dragged on and on. It doesn't seem very realistic; Delancey and MacKenzie have their professional lives set by the time they're twenty. Delancey and MacKenzie didn't seem to be very well developed characters to me. But this is the first book I read by Lori Wick, so I would be willing to read something else by her."
5,My Favorite Book,This Book by Lori Wick was a well written book. Truly one of my absolute favorites.
5,This book draws you into the lives of the characters.,"This book draws the reader into the lives of the characters. I cried, laughed, and rejoiced with the characters. It was very easy to feel as though they were really apart of my life. I even got mad at one point and put the book down for a couple of days until I cooled down, and then I finished reading it. There are several twists in the plot that come out of know where memicking real life. Each character has such dept that you feel as though you really know them. It is simply outstanding."
3,Mislabeled,"This seems to be a Memory Stick PRO, not a PRO Duo. While a Duo can work using an adapter, the Memory Stick PRO will not fit in any device that uses only the PRO Duo."
2,Not what I expected,I bought this book together with Everyone Poops because I'm dealing with these issues with my kids. I didn't find this book very helpful and attractive for small kids. Perhaps it's better for kids from 8 upwards.
3,The Gas We Pass,"A comical book that should delight readers both young and old! It approaches a subject not often broached in ""polite company"" with a down-to-earth approach. It could be of value in toilet training or a humorous addition to a bathroom library."
4,"I Really Like The Theory Represented In This Book, BUT..........","No pun intended, BUT I have a problem with the word fart.As I teacher, we were told that was a word not to be used. I said Bort............. The book explains this subject well and when I found it at the bookstore today, everyone around me had a laugh. However, we all agreed that we'd have trouble reading it to our children and as I teacher, I would. I bought it for a gag gift for my older son.I thought it was cleverly written about a bodily function that happens to the best of us. As a matter of fact, it happened to me in the store today!!!! LOL"
1,pass on this one,The last thing my 6-year-old needs is someone to tell him it's ok to let it rip. No manners taught in this book.
2,Not as good,"I bought ""Everybody Poops"" and thought this would be as good. It didn't hold the interest. I wish I hadn't bought this one."
4,Terrance & Phillip approve,"Those stars of Southpark may be full of hot air, but they wholefeartedly endorse this book.Their only complaint was that the drawings were a bit too simplistic..."
5,Very Educational!,"This book is interesting and educational. The author make the whole science of ""FART"" in a simple way that a preschooler can understand. I even enjoy reading the book to my baby girl. A must buy for your kid!"
2,K&W NanoTechnology Head Gasket and Block Repair,"Without being to lengthy in words, I came home from having coffee and noticed my car running like it needed a tune up and in my rear view mirror I had noticed white smoke. Stepping out of the car and looking at the smoke I had observed antifreeze spraying on the ground. I checked my radiator and found it almost empty. I followed the instructions to the letter and my car dumped this product out of the tail pipe too. All I can say is it depends on how big you leaky gasket is. It didn't do what all the promises on the back said. If you ever noticed you're losing antifreeze somewhere and you checked everything, put it in before it get real bad or it won't work."
1,Waste of time.,"I tried this product on a 1990 Toyota Corolla. It seemed like it was running better, but when the car heats up, there is still white smoke. This product may work on small leaks. Maybe my head gasket is too far gone for this type of repair."
2,.....uuuugh.....,"Despite the presence of some mighty fine dance singles from the past year ( I'm still grooving to ""All This Time"" in particular )this has got to be one of the absolute worst mixing jobs I have ever heard. Technically and artistically this mix is a total hatchet job, with nary a smooth trasition to be found or any real sense of flow."
5,Freeze Alarm,A great little device that I will count on to monitor our other home this winter. I emailed a question about using the device to the service center and had a response within a few hours (not bad for online support).
3,Software in book runs perfectly but has not been helpful to me.,"I purchased the book in an attempt to jump start developing an automated rule based trading system. The software runs perfectly without problems. Unfortunately I have not found the strategies or indicators to be helpful after testing them on limited historical data. I have found the book (and software on a CD that comes with the book) ""New Trading Systems and Methods"" by Perry J. Kaufman to be extremely helpful in developing a rule based automated trading system."
4,Nice Art Deco touch,"Very nice postcard display book. While it cannot fit all sizes of postcards, it can hold up to a 4x6 size. I like the feel of the cover and the way the book can lay flat."
4,Cartes Postales - an album for postcards,"Cartes Postales: An Album for PostcardsI collect early 1900's postcards of the area where I live. This is the perfect album to store them for perusing time and time again. Each page will accomodate postcards of various sizes, which is helpful for those that are not the standard size. I love the arts & crafts/art nouveau design on the album cover, which lends itself well to the decor of my 1918 bungalow."
1,Horrible,"One of the worst songs from one of popular music's most embarrassing eras, this junk should be banished from the airwaves as punishment for all the misery it caused. Synthetically produced, and poorly sung, it is one of the lamest cliches of the horrid disco era. For the love of God, avoid."
2,Works great most of the time,"I have had one of these installed for about 3 years. Last week two of the stations failed in the ON position. No, the valves were not full of dirt, the controller shorted and two of the stations were on no matter what (except if I unplugged the controller). This is a really bad thing, for the device to have a failure mode where stations get stuck on. Hunter technical support was not helpful and offered no suggestions other than to replace the unit. NOT recommended."
1,this game stinks,The cars don't look real. They didn't handle worth a darn. Graphics need serious help. Wasn't worth the money.
5,This book should still be in PRINT!!,I have already read this book six times-and we have only had it 24 hoours! It is a fun book to read and it brings on the giggles every time we do. My daughter is a cat lover(almost 3)but you don't have to be a cat lover to enjoy it.
4,The Ultimate Pro Wrestling History Lesson on DVD,"I had purchased this collection on VHS back in the early 90's and found it very good then. Getting to see some of todays stars/legends wrestle when they were alot younger (and greener, in some cases) was great, and also seeing action from the territories, which there are virtually none of these days.But w/ this collection on DVD, just the quality alone makes it worth watching, but for me, the greatest part is the additional commentary from Wrestling Observer frontman Dave Meltzer and Jim Cornette. If you are a wrestling insider ""junkie"" as I am, and love to learn about the history of the SPORT of pro wrestling, the commentary from these 2 will certainly give you your fix. The biographies I could have done without, but the whole set is great. A completely different world from today's ""sports entertainment"" wrestling. I hope they are planning a 2nd edition."
4,An informative production,We were pleased with this product. It gave a detailed look at all the stages of pregnancy and was very informative. I have recommend this to all my pregnant girlfriends and family members.
4,From an Expecting Family,"We were amazed with this video, and it was neat for us to watch how our little child is growing and changing. Our only dislike is the references to evolution, but we highly recommend this video."
4,National Geographic- In the Womb,Fantastic insight into fetal development. Computer simulated images with real life ultrasound images show developement as its never been seen before. Comentary is at a level the average person can understand.
4,Fave pregnancy movie,This is a really good movie since it stays away from one extreme or another when it comes to childbirth. Focusing more on the development more than anything. The graphics are kinda cheesy but what would you expect.
3,"Interesting, but not to the Magazine standard","This big format book failed short of my expectations. It contains varied information but lacks the quality of the Magazine photography. It covers new and ancient world alike, but I found information rather superficial and detail sometimes obscures the big picture.When compared to other books, like The Times Atlas of Archaeology , it comes second place. Book names are not alike, but scope of coverage is similar.Maybe young readers will like it best than adult ones. Drawing and pictures are big in size.I'm not saying its a bad book, but that it couldn't retain my attention. After going through it, seldom if ever I have come back to look for more information."
5,"Real reggae, real nice. Ites! Ites!","John Brown's Body album 'Among Them' is not to be missed. The music and the message ring true - a creative yet classic reggae sound that is grooving and danceable with a vocal message that ascends the craziness of materialism and consumerism, and speaks of the true values of life - love, peace and harmony. A universal message for all of us. The CD has ten or so vocal tracks with two or three dub tracks. The mix is very warm, with strong drum and bass, clear vocals, and solid horns and keys, plus the dubwork is amazing! Highly recommended."
3,The Most Critical Information Ever,"It took me years to understand what it takes to be successfull in MLM and it has nothing to do with one's talents or the lack thereof.One of the most sure ways I learned in becoming successful is identifing the right company to be a part of and one that is positioned at the beginning of a trend. Richard Poe's book, 'Wave 3 : The New Era in Network Marketing', page 69, teaches you the importance of knowing where a company is positioned within it's markets place.Just knowing how to apply that chart to a network marketing company is priceless. Yes, I bought the book and THE most valuable information came from one page.However, let me say this. Because I understand this information I'm able to make a more intelligent decision when analyzing and picking MLM companies. The company I picked as a result of this information alone allowed me to earn a full-time income in 7 months!So buy the book and study page 69!I hope this helps you!Be Blessed and Properous"
4,Wave 3:The New Era inNetwork Marketing,"Wave 3 was a very helpful book because it showed both sides to Network Marketing. Many people in this business are going to go through stumbling blocks, however, through endurance it is very likely, and possible that you can become very successful. Wave 3 also serves as a guide. The author gives the reader key principles that other successful Network Marketers have already learned the hard way, but, at the same time they had to implement them before they were able to become successful in Network Marketing."
5,Making me a million,The principles taught in Poe's book are making me a million dollars. I'm very sincere and I have no relatioship with the author or pulisher. The right company and Poe's book are the right combination. http://www.accelerated.com/presidential/newvision
1,Horrible,Billed as a light comedy - it is just dreck. Save your money and your time and skip this one.
5,My favorite knife for everyday cooking,"If you have small hands like me, then this knife is perfect. Some of the other reviews mention the weight of this knife... for me, this knife is great. I have small hands, and they get cramped or tired after a while if I am using a heavy blade. So I went looking for a knife just for me. I looked at different brands (Henckel etc) but finally made my choice with this knife. My main reason was the lack of weight, and the handle fits my hands perfectly without hurting them from prolong use. I do a lot of cutting and chopping, so knew that it had to be comfortable in my hand or I would never use it. For me, it was worth paying more for a GOOD knife than having to change knives every year. I've been using this knife for about 3 years now, and have never had a problem using it."
3,Not as good as the original,"I bought a Wusthof Grand Prix II Santoku 4175/17cm years ago (7+) and as soon as I picked this one up, I knew it was different. Not only is it 10 grams lighter than mine, the blade composition is also not the same. I think the new composition makes the blade more flexible but my husband says it's because the blade is thinner. I love my old Santoku knife, so much so I wanted another one. However, this new one just doesn't compare. I gave this 3 stars because I am basing my review on a comparison of an earlier make of the exact knife. Also, the knife Amazon sent was not the same composition as the one shown in the picture. The one I received has X50CrMoV15 with no little tic tac toe boxes on the blade. Doesn't matter, I'm sending it back."
3,Works well with argosy,"Great replacement for the sun-baked originals in the argosy; the only issue is my sewing skills leave something to be desired.While these can be purchased slightly cheaper at specialty RV stores, the convenience of purchase well outweighed searching for a retail location with enough in stock (of the correct size)."
4,Moe still rules!,"Moe rocks her way back into our hearts with blue hair, her low slung guitar and a new band! After Softball broke up Rie and Haruna joined up with Syunsuke and started the Babys (excellent band) while Moe got together with 3 other girls to form Akiakane. Kasumisou is basicly what you'd expect from the former front woman of Softball, rock'n catchy punk songs. Just about all the songs on this album are re-recordings (mostly in english) of songs form two of there japanese mini albums, Hana wa Sakuragi Hito wa Bushi and No White Supremacy. I give this album a 4 only because I like some of the original japanese recordings better. If your looking for some good'ol japanese all girl punk rockers Moe delivers, and rules! So buy this album before China declares war on Moe!!!!"
5,Excellent Material for All Levels of Experience.,"Andre' knows his stuff, This is an entertaining and comprehensive book. It shows you what you need to know with Win32, API and more. Its hilarious on alot of aspects, just plain fun to learn this way. Cuts out the clutter that isnt needed. Keep it up Andre', you make it easier for the rest of us. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to dive right on into windows game programming yes its in C++, the soon to be standard for programming, so learn it while you can. Get this book and get coding."
1,Way out of date,"I'm writing this in May 2002. This book is now four years old, so the information is pretty much irrevelant. While one can argue the principles of Windows game programming are the same, you simply can't do much with the information in this book any more. The content, while useful when the book first came out, is just outdated. Besides, there are a lot of inaccuracies in the book (e.g., ""first games were written for UNIX mainframes in the 60s and 70s""... UNIX mainframes?).If you are an aspiring game programmer, look for books published within the past 12 months -- and there are many good volumes on DirectX 8 programming."
5,VERY GOOD FOR A BEGINNER,"A YEAR AGO I STARTED TEACHING MYSELF C++ AND WHEN I GOT COMFORTABLE WITH THAT I BEGIN LEARNING ABOUT GRAPHICS AND INPUT, I TRIED MANY DIFFERENT GAME PROGRAMMING BOOKS FOR BEGINNERS AND THEY WERE EITHER WRITTEN POORLY OR THEY HAD CODE MISSING THEN ONE DAY I PICKED UP THIS BOOK THE SOURCE CODE RAN THE WAY IT WAS SUPPOSED TO AND IT ALSO SERVES AS A GREAT REFERENCE FOR PROJECTS I PLAN ON DOING REAL SOON, HELL EVEN IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO JUST GRAPHICS, IT HAS A PRETTY SOLID SECTION ABOUT THE INPUT AND SOUND I DEFINITELY RECOMEND THIS BOOK FOR NEWBIES TO MID PROGRAMMERS."
1,Not a good book,"Sorry by my english, it is not very well.I bought this book thinking I can learn to program video games. I was WRONG.The first chapters introduce you to C (ONLY introduce, not a good explanation), and later LaMothe begin to talk about DirectX and explain the declarations of the functions, only that. I think this book is not for dummies, is for C and DirectX experimented programmers. Don't buy it, it's a waste of time and money."
2,Windows Game Programming for Suckers,"This book is really substandard. Instead of trying to explain how to use direct X and write games, the author simply throws code at you. Worse yet, it's poorly documented code. If you don't like the ""here's the code, you figure it out"" approach, do not buy this book."
3,"good, but has NO DIRECT3D","It's a good book, but has absolutely no info on Direct3D. I think it should have at least an index of Direct3D functions. It also requires a small amount of knowledge on C or C++. However, it is great for beginners."
3,"Very Good, But lacks a couple of essentials","This is a good book, but I've also read Inside DirectX which I thought was better. It is excellent in that it goes very in depth and spends several chapters just introducing windows programming before it gets to DirectX. But I feel that it lacks in some very important areas which were covered in Inside DirectX, like lost surfaces or sound buffers, which the only comments about these are ""very bad"". However, the AI chapter makes this a very useful book, together with Inside DirectX I feel I have unlocked a wealth of knowledge on DX."
5,One of the best books on this subject,"This book is one of the best books about game programming. Even as a newbie you have a good and easy way to learn a lot about game programming, you don't need much pre-knowledge. It's a good balance between a simple entry and advanced programming-technics.The style is nice and the examples are easy to understand and big enough to become a master of game programming. And last but not least: Every $ is a good investment because the structure of this book is very well for learning every other project which the novice want to do for himself or some customers."
1,The Programs Don't Compile!,"I have microsoft visual C++ 6.0 Pro and from the first WINAPI WinMain on chapter 3 to the end of the book the programs just don't work. The compiler's help says this ""As a result of improved C++ conformance, some constructs that used to compile will now give errors. Each error message that may result from some of these changes is flagged by ""(new behavior; please see help)"" at the end of the message. This doesn't mean that the error message has a new meaning; it means that the compiler may be diagnosing an error which it previously did not."" ---The programming lines cuasing the error are in every program example. So working around this is impossible - If anyone knows of a fix or can contact the writer and can get him to post somekind of update - please email. Otherwise I'd say don't waste the money on this book."
4,"Very good, but compiling, BLECH!","This book explains every aspect of DirectX and Windows VERY well, and I would recommend it to anyone. The only problem is that it wont compile! It gives me all these errors... I installed DirectX and all that on the cd... If anyone can help me EMAIL ME !! icegod1@usa.netthanks!"
1,"It Has It's Moments, But....","As someone who was introduced to rock and roll by KJR and Pat O'Day in 1963, I wanted to like this book. And parts of it, especially the photographs and recollections of KJR and its airstaff in the sixties, I did. However, it is also poorly organized, over-long, and simply needed an editor, not least for grammatical errors. Most appalling was the number of factual mistakes, from misspelling of proper names (Peter ""Noonan"" instead of Noone; Celine ""Dionne"" instead of Dion; ""Sun"" amplifier instead of Sunn). O'Day begins every section with the name of a song, artist and year--many of those years are wrong (one by the better part of a decade). The author has a great story to tell, but he doesn't tell it very well."
3,Solid but not spectacular,"The Soviet Colossus offers a good overview of the history of the USSR. The book tends to be a dry read, though. The other problem I have with it is the book devotes only a tiny sliver of its pages to discussing the Soviet Union's foreign policy. Given the major role the USSR played on the global stage (which is after all partly why the book is titled ""Soviet Colossus"") this was a disappointing flaw. All in all, though, this book is worth reading. It provides a basic history of the USSR and its key leaders. The sections discussing the Bolshevik Revolution, the period leading up to it, and the formative years of the Soviet Union under Lenin are particularly strong."
3,Demo review,"I have played the demo of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and it was pretty good. The demo wasen't amazing, but it has some cool features. You can run on walls and pull off some bad arse moves. It felt kind of slow though, and defeating ememys isn't very exciting at this point. The graphics were alright, nothing to brag about but they weren't bad at all. I hope the full version is better because this game has alot of potential. I'm sure there will be some improvements in the full game. I have a feeling this is going to be Ubi Softs next big hit. Ubi Soft also published games such as Ghost Recon and Splinter Cell. So this should be good."
3,meh,"I bought this game 'cause I saw the movie with Jake whatshisface and I was like okay, I'll play the game. the game is obviously nothing like the movie really, but its a pretty okay game. the controls can get really irritating and you can fail like a thousand times before you realize what you are doing wrong. the story is blah but I haven't finished playing it. that should say enough about what I think about the game."
2,I Must vent,"I am playing the game right now and I have to type meanly on my keyboard. To get started I loved the 2D prince of persias and for that I started playing this expecting a lot. My first impression was that this was a great game, the graphics are beautiful and the moves are cool. But that is the end. there are so many horrible parts to this game I could never get to them all. worst of all though are the camera angles. this game had so much potential and they completely ruined it. COMPLETELY. half the time the view is shifted so that you cannot see yourself or the important action going on. next, you have to protect this obnoxious (...)that does absolutely nothing but get in th eway and get you in trouble. in short i wish i could have loved it but I really hate this game and the only think that keeps me playing is the need to finish it so I can throw it away."
5,This game is the best thing since me and hip hop,If u dont get this game u needa slap. This game and its life like graphics is great and the moves he doin is bangin. Every1 gotta cop dis game besides the gurl look good for a fake person yea kno wut i mean ight yall peace ~1~
3,its pretty,"its pretty..u can walk on walls...thats about it...but why...why.....its a game made by the french set in persia with british voice actors..in america....okkkeday.....and the gameplay is boring...ill go on record saying jumping on poles is not entertaing...the fighting is ok, and it was a good choice of not making it a button masher...u hold the block button for awhile and walk around till u find a opening, then u attack...its good fighting..and its good theres not too much of it cuz thatd get really annoying if it was one of those ""kill baddies in one room, go next room, repeat"" type of game with that fighting style"
3,"Good, if you're allready good.","This book gives a detailed, if very British, account of knowing and maintaining the Land Rover Defender. Writers of automotive manuals should take some technical writing lessons from those in the software realm. Describing a multi-step procedure in the context of a paragraph is at best, unappealing. Some of the tasks described are very advanced however, and this is the book's strong area. It is very ADVANCED. If you already know your Rover inside and out, go for this book (especially if you're familliar with British slang and Local Color), but others should beware. As side notes, this is not a long book, nor is it color."
5,Great Book,I have read 3 other books by erica spindler and I have to say that this is the best so far. Its the kind of book you don't want to stop reading and can't wait to see what happens
4,All Fall Down is a great read,"Like all of Erica Spindler novels, this is a very entertaining book to read. Erica is a wonderful storyteller and never ceases to amaze me with her talent! You won't know what will happen until the very end (you may try to guess but you will be surprised at the outcome). It kept me awake at night wanting more & trying to finish the book. What I really like about this book is the relationships between the characters and their stories and struggles with life are very well explained. The suspense of the book is seemlessly fit into every character in this book. It's fantastic!"
1,Please label it lesbian romantic suspect,"I love everything she writes but when I want romantic suspence it's not lesbian romantic suspense.. I love lesbians, dont get me wrong but get them their own book and warn me fist. Ruined the book, can't even finish.WTH????"
2,boring,"The story itself is great, but that and the best graphics out there didn't save this game for me. if you like doing the SAME thing over and over again, perhaps a career in mail sorting is in order.this game's fight engine is sooooo boring. I don't need to fight a bunch of the same monsters over and over again just to get to the next save. it is soooo d*mn repetitive. i kept flashing back to donkey kong and spyhunter. This genre is surely dead."
5,Like a real pet!,"I just started playing with a Tamagotchi, and I already love it! It's like a real pet. For the most part, you feed it, play with it, and leave it alone untill it calls you. Plus, you can hook it on your jeans and take it with you. I find it a cool fashion accessory. The only down side is, like a real pet, it will sometimes refuse to play. But, it's still totally worth $15!"
5,a cool cool toy,my brother has one and adores it. he cares for it.he thinks as well as i do that it is a cool as can be toy.
2,A complete disappointment......,"what I really want to know is, how can 0-1 be so good?, and 0-2 be soooooo bad!!! The story is not continued as it should have been, and the animation is not as great as it was. The music is still good, which is the only thing that kept this from getting a single star instead of 2."
3,ultimate collection,"Honestly this does not get it, it's a good cd for a nils freak but my favorite is cry tough. and it's discontinued. i'm looking."
2,Uh...,"Seven characters on seven big quests. Sounds like an idea, huh? Well, the thing is...ideas don't always translate well. My biggest complaint is that this game is WAY too tedious. In order to pass any of the seven quests, you'll have to wade through countless battles with minimum rewards to accrue enough money and stats to pass the end. Most of the game is spent on incessant fighting, which just isn't enough to keep me glued for long. But alas, even the stories aren't all that great. Of the seven quests, some of them intertwining with others in some fashion, I found perhaps two to be mildly compelling, and when I say mildly compelling, I mean they'd be worth a mini-quest in other, more thought out RPGs. Even then, there just isn't enough depth to draw one in. Implied lesbian characters aside, there isn't much to recommend this game."
3,Too much Patience,"I must be one of the handful of people in the world who's acually beaten this game all the way through. I have a great deal of patience expecting the fun to kick in any second. However the ""fun"" never came and I was as bored as hell through the whole game. The battle system was a nice shot and worth the effort if it was in a different game. I only credit it so high because it's under such a great name. It's great for non-linear players also, but still not worth the time invested in this game. But this game will make the next game you play the best game in the world. I never thought I'd be falling in love with Beyond the Beyond considdering nobody likes that game. After that I played Suikoden and I believe Konomi are all now gods. ~Seth~"
2,Not quite good enough,"Initially ""Saga Frontier"" is quite interesting, but unfortunately it quickly bogs down from there. The game offers seven different characters in seven different stories (some of which are actually quite interesting); this is a very neat idea, but the action gets repetitive after exploring the same area in different stories. The fight action is interesting at first, but this too gets repetitive in a rather short time. One thing I did like was the backgrounds; some of them were just beautifully rendered. Unfortunately the character/monster graphics just did not fit in with the background; they were two different styles that just did not mesh well with each other. If the game had offered a better combat engine and more unique areas for each character, ""Saga Frontier"" would have been a pretty good game."
5,Very cute for all ages,"I love this product. Young and old can put together these cards. They are so cute and can be sent to anyone who is young at heart. Kids and adults will enjoy receiving a ""Coconut"" greeting card."
5,GREAT INVENTION,"I BROUGH THIS PREVIEW MONITOR FOR MY EPSON 825 IN DECEMBER BECAUSE I'VE SEARCHED HIGH AND LOW FOR A DIGITAL PRINTER THAT PREVIEWS THE PICTURES BEFORE THEIR PRINTED BUT THEY WERE TOO EXPENSIVE. THEN I FOUND AMAZON.COM AND WENT TO ACCESSORIES AND THERE IT WAS NOT ONLY A GREAT INVENTION, BUT THE BEST VALUE I COULD HAVE GOT FOR MY BUDGET . THE EPSON PEOPLE ARE GENIUSES' THANK YOU FOR GIVING THE PHOTO INDUSTRY THIS HELPFUL GADGET.P.S THE PREVIEWS ARE CLEAR AND VIBRANTLY VISIBLE."
3,Of course I would,"I bought this CD because the 'Would you' song is a classic, of course. The rest of the CD is fairly bland, but that isn't why most of you would probably buy it in the first place. There are a few decent songs on there though."
1,Disappointed,"I had ordered a used ""in good condition"" leather bound edition of the Presbyterian Hymnal at a cost of $31.90 from Your On Line Bookstore. I received, (very promptly), a standard hard cover hymnal which retails new for about $14.00. I emailed the company asking that they send the product I ordered. They replied that they did not have the leather bound edition and that I should send the hardcover version back to them - ""return receit requested"" postage. The cost of the postage was about $8.00. So I'm out $8 and without the hymnal I wanted. Certainly not the end of the world - but to descirbe my experience - I would say, ""Disappointed""."
5,One of the best game ever...,"Except for the loading time, nothing is wrong with that game. It has everything the casual or hardcore gamer might seek in a game: incredible storyline, interesting, not overly complex nor too simplistic gameplay, and a fantastic atmosphere. For once, ALL the items, spells and weapons are useful, and you have to learn to make combinations, as well as using the shapeshifting abilities properly. The plot is intricate, very well written and simply epic, majestically told by very talented voice actors. Indeed, this game is a must ^^"
1,"Good, but only good!","The title accurately relfects the theme of the novel. I mildly enjoyed reading this postmodern construction interspersed with light poetic ruminations on unimportant matters. Unfortunatelly , reading this book has been a perfectly forgettable experience."
2,Not very good,"Not very good compared to the Test Drive Le mans from Infogrames. This ""Goodtimes Interactive"" needs to learn how to make a decent Le mans sim. If yo want a VERY VERY VERY GOOD Le mans sim, check out the Dreamcast verion, which is frankly the only good le mans sime out there. Infogrames did a horrid job porting it to ps2. Blech! The one fer DC is perfect, and one of the best racers ever made. You should checo out my review for it. :)"
4,You know the drill...,"Originality? CheckDiverse Gameplay? It's hereWonderful graphics? You know itBut, unfortunately like great titles like Mark of Kri, Ico, and the Frequency series, this too has gone largely unnoticed by the gaming community. And now, it joins the bargain bin along with the aforementioned games. Good for those who don't yet have it, but bad for the industry in general.I mean really, if games this good don't sell, can you blame developers for not wanting to make them?Buy this game NOW...or wait until it gets cheaper. You'll enjoy it."
1,This product sucks!,The VCR function broke after two times of use. I went to BEST BUY to get a price of how much it would be to fix and it turned out to be more than the price of the product itself! All you folks considering buying it should reconsider.
1,Had To Send It Back,"The beeper didn't work on the continuity tester, so I sent the product back to Northern Tool. I brought a similarly priced mulitmeter from Radio Shack in it place."
3,airborne...better than this!,"good history, but not very detailed in the training aspects of the modern soldiers...a good documentary, but not a must have for those preparing for going down that road."
3,"Great graphics, kinda tough","This game is fun, and mazey. There are a lot of items you have to pick up along the way and you always have to read the scrolls. I actually ended up going backwards at one point in the game and didn't know what I'd done wrong. (The game goes from the left to right to right to left back and forth, and that is the mazey part). Another complaint I have is that the sands of time instrument is pointless. You think, ""oh yay! I can rewind time and not die!!"" WRONG. You rewind time only to watch yourself die again and hear the horrid background music once again. However, I can't blow if off completely because, the sands of time instrument is useful about 1 out of 10 times.With disregard to all that, this game is pretty fun, and I would recommend it....Unless you get lost easy and are usually tempted to give up."
4,pleasantly surprised,"For the price, and for a map, you get a lot of info and opinions.Better info then in any of the books. cancun alive is good but this is better--if you are going to playa del carmen-you should bring this map"
5,Inuyasha IS DA BOMB!!,If you like the show you will like this even though it's in Japanese they have subtitles. You can play by yourself or with a friend it's a totally awsome game!
3,Good Game,The game is pretty good for the Playstation 2. I do enjoy the multiplayer portion of the game. The only thing I didn't like was the combo moves. Executing them to me was hard enough with all the button smashing I had to do.
3,Perfect for some people...,"This video is a little mislabled, I find it to be far from a guide and more of a documentary on the SAS and how they train. I did pick up some useful tips on survival, but nothing in comparison to John Wiseman's book. You should not expect more though, for it is only a 52-minute movie. The quality is also in need of attention. They should have named this video ""A Brief Summary and Explanation of Some Survival Techniques of the SAS"". Maybe they picked a short name for a reason. I give this about a 3 for someone into survival, and a 4 for someone interested in learing about the SAS."
2,Luke's belief,"Tales of Destiny is undoubtedly the most boring RPG in the history of video games. I started playing with a much higher expectation, and ended disappointed. In addition, I finished the game curious of the ending, only to discover another disappointment.I spent at least 40 hours playing this game, and vamoosed from approximately 200 battles, as a result of boredom. Even with a strategy guide, I was left in the dark several times. One may walk around aimlessly for hours without a strategy guide at hand. Overall, this game is not recommended by me, but then again everybody has a different opinion."
3,Good but drawn out a bit,Good plot line but a little too much detail for mt liking. Quality piece of writing though.
1,craptacular,"Most of the answers to the exercises in Appendix A don't even compile, much less work. I admit I'm not a great code writer, but at some point you need the answer, otherwise you can sit in front of your screen all day writing code that doesn't work or compile. I can do that without the help of this book."
4,Cool Corvette AutoCross Racing Video.,"Vhs Tape, Cool Vid, Sometimes the sound is not too good, a little so-so here and there the way its put together, but a Nice video. and its basically a Corvette Autocross Video, With several of the owners talking and Plenty of autocross Action. A Different video than whats already out there."
1,HP 3320,Purchased based on positive experience of other reviews. When tried to install the the computer could not find device. I tried on a few machines and downloaded different driver from the HP website. But to no avail.The machine did not work. Making arrangements with Amazon for return
1,You get what you pay for,"I bought this printer 4 months ago and probably printed about 500 pages on it before it broke. The printer sucked up ink at an amazing rate and, even worse, did not allow me to print in grayscale. So, I ended up using color ink even when I didn't need it. Yesterday, the cable that moves the print cartridges across the paper failed and it will cost more to fix than the cost of the printer. Although I was happy with the quality of printing, I don't think buying a new printer every 4 months at $50 a pop is worth it. I'm going to try a Canon next time."
1,The Worst !!!,"The worst printer I've ever had, I just used it for 4 months and its broken: I won't keep on buying HP products anymore."
5,Great game,"I love this game. As a younger kid I had it and loved it, but I lost and now I have it again thanks to you. It came in a matter of a few days."
2,too heavy,"the shoes are too heavy to walk around in. When i received thisit had a very strong smell of shoe polish. I have allergiesso i washed it several times but the smell wouldn't go away& i kept wheezing. Also the size 8 1/2 that i usually wear wastoo large so i exchanged it for an 8.(They were very prompt).But it still felt heavy & clumsy. (I prefer the ""CROCS"" brand.They are comfortable & lightweight )."
1,Really poor scholarship.,"Badly written, replete with glaring and basic errors that one would expect even a first year undergraduate to spot - how on earth did this man find employment in Cambridge University? Worth reading for that mystery, but for no other reason."
2,Art History Buffs Only,"If you are not HUGELY into art history, theory, or painting, this will probably not be a very enjoyable read. I understand, though, that if you are, it is enthralling and marvelous and full of ideas that you have to go to art school to learn. I wish I went to art school before I read this book -- probably would have enjoyed it thoroughly; unfortunately, it was about as exciting to read as a slab of drywall."
2,this game can be better,"as i said this game could be better the banana kicks are okay. I bought this game when i first bought my playstation,although my kid brother fancies it but i see nothing there.the manual says you can kick the ball once thekeeper catches it but it is nonsense the slide tackles don`t work. The game is for babies if you want soccer play FIFA SOCCER 99.Although i`ve been a gamer for just 4years i know a good game when i see it."
5,Good conclusion to a great series...with a small exception.,"I have all four books. This one was very good. The only exception is that in two places, I thought it was somewhat anti-climatic. I won't ruin it by saying where they are.However, they weren't enough to give less than five stars. Every book in this series is worthy of five stars."
5,An Incredible CD for a Great Cause!,"If you are in the know as far as local Boston female singer-songwriters, then you probably already have this CD. If you are not familiar with some or all of the artists on this compilation, then this is a great opportunity to get a taste of the vibrant Boston music scene while helping a worthy cause. The line-up of musicians is amazing, and this double CD sells for the price of one!You cannot go wrong with this CD - This is a win-win deal :-)"
4,This is a keeper,"Josslyn Hardin got a chance to go to Egypt, only it wasn't a job there for her.The Beacon company wanted a person who could speak Egyption,and male.Thane Addison the boss of the Egyption branch wanted nothing to do with a female secertary, but he no more than sees Joss, then he is taking her to a hotel. Then when he introduced her to one of his Egyption customers and bam his son Khalil Rashwan he was smitten right away.Thane didn't like than so he sent her to an apartment. Before he knew it he was watching every move Joss made.Thane was in love but he didn't know how to let Joss know.So he became a mucho man, and she stood up to him, even though he was her boss.When Thane came on to Joss she gave into him, but as ususal with Ms Steele only so far.Thane finally gave in and bit the big one. Love and Marrage.If you like this book Susan Fox is even better, Helen Brooks, and Rebecca Winters are on the same line as Jessica Steele."
4,Good start,"I love that this product is environmentally friendly, but every now and then the soap doesn't rinse away completely and it isn't strong enough to keep whites white."
3,Good reading for anyone in recovery and interested in spirituality,"A compelling book in many ways - especially the first heartbreaking pages of Levine's story, beginning with childhood suicidal ideation. Levine writes about years of suffering in drug addiction and destructive and anti-social behavior that spring from a rebellious attitude, and then finally getting some relief from his demons through AA and meditation practice, particularly the ""Year to Live"" practice written about by his father, spiritual teacher Stephen Levine. This book is not a literary marvel - it is often repetitive and shallowly descriptive - so it's not a must read for Buddhists. However, it would be extremely helpful for anyone dealing with recovery or with friends who are substance abusers. Also, the endnotes include a very nice instruction for mindfulness meditation."
5,Thank you,I love this book. My husband is in rehab and I brought a second copy for him. He is enjoying the book. Noah shares that there is peace after the storm. He shows that hurting your self is not the way to go against the norm. His book really impacted my life and others.
4,Finding The Way,"Dharma Punx follows the story of a young man who finds out who he is. Noah moves around a lot as a kid and gets mixed up with drugs and alcohol. HIs only release is the punk scene, its the only thing he thinks is worth while. He then starts to learn to meditate and turn his life around. He finds that all kinds of people, including hard core punks, meditate. Along with a few friends Noah takes a very interesting trip half way around the world to learn more about finding himself. Through Noah's own journey in life, he tells an amazing story of his struggles and his accomplishments. This was interesting story and I enjoyed seeing the transitions from Noah's ""dark ages"" to his life today."
5,Great oil,"I use this apricot kernel oil for skincare and haircare. The 16oz bottle comes with some ideas for what you can use this oil for. For haircare I use a mix of apricot kernel oil, sweet almond oil, and jojoba oil and it's been good for my scalp and my hair with all its vitamin E and moisturizing properties. For skincare, these oils absorb quickly into the skin and doesn't leave an oily residue. My skin is so much softer now and the creases on my neck have been reduced. I'm not at the age to have many wrinkles on my face yet, but it's improved the texture of my skin and I have not gotten any pimples from these oils. This price is also cheaper than what I could find on ebay. I'm happy with this product!"
3,Jury is still out,"""Mosquito Catcher"" as a name was an extremely bad marketing move. Your expectations are a drawer full of dead mosquitos. After watching the DVD that came with the machine, one realizes that this device does not really ""catch"" mosquitos, but instead grinds them up in the fan that is used to suck them in. The bits that are left fall to the ground. So to judge the effectiveness based on what's in the compartment isn't really fair.I'm still not sure if this works. Instructions are to run for a month to fully disrupt the breeding cycle. I'll have to wait and see if the insects are less prevalent in a few weeks."
4,A Fellowship for Emma,"Dana Cameron's A FUGITIVE TRUTH bring Emma Fielding to Massachusetts to study the coded diaries of Margaret Chandler who was accused of witchcraft and tried for murder.Previous Emma had excavated the grounds of Margaret's New England home and developed an affinity for this early English settler. Events parallel the diary and the death of Emma's former classmate Faith who was also a fellow at the institute.Ms. Cameron manages to develop some academic stereotypes that read like cliches, but in my experience have a direct relationship to some I've met in real life. I think it was the late Robert B. Parker who made the comment that academic battles are so vicious because the stakes are so small.Nash Black, author of Indie finalists WRITING AS A SMALL BUISNESS and HAINTS."
2,Okay!,Listen this game may be old and some people say it sucks.But in its time it was good back in 1996 when it came out 'til 2001.So if you like this game and can't find it anywhere order it because they are very very cheap used and sure as heck worth a matter of cents for sure okay!!!!!!!
1,Sorry Excuse for a Video Game,"The Graphics (...), the idea of the game (...), the handling (...), thank god I only paid (dollar amount) for mine.The graphics look like you're playing a Nintendo. Why anyone would want it ?The only reason this got one star is because there is no option for zero starsDon't buy this.Ugh :("
5,"Love ""gold filled"" jewelry!!!","Love ""gold filled"" and not just ""plated"" -- These gold filled clasps are perfect for adding charms to my bracelet!! Thanks!!!!"
2,Buy this one,"This book is essentially the same book as the one called ""classic mack trucks"", by the same author. This book has some more photos, and is set up a little different. I liked this version better, and unfortunately I bought both, thinking they were different. If you must buy one, buy this one, even though the other book has a better cover photo."
2,The Sargossa what?!?,"This is a totally silly Polish film from 1965, I only watched it because there are all these signs on the outside saying that it is the favourite film of Jerry Garcia, Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppolla (interesting, right?), but the film itself is not quite what you'd want to commit three hours to. It is interesting to some extend, in that it shows an event, and then jumps back to the event that precedes that (through some storytelling or otherwise), and just meanders about through various sword fights and other hallucinogenic episodes (mostly involving a skull-shaped chalice). Delicous. The common image throughout is of the two criminals tortured and left to die, the two voluptuous sister, and woman's two breasts. Beautiful."
5,Perfect for the Gerber Evolution,"Perfect companion for the Gerber Evolution. The jaws are incredibly sturdy and will stand up to much heavier use than other pairs of needle nose pliers that I own. Best of all, because of the Evolution's unique quick change heads, I'm able to leave other tools at home as the knife and up to 3 heads can fit in the Gerber pouch [that comes with the knife itself.] One very interesting feature is the wire cutters located just above the pivot. Each triangle shaped blade is attached by a small screw. This enables each to be rotated [each side is fashioned as a wire cutter] and replaced as needed.I have no complaints regarding this particular head [but had related complaints about the knife itself] However, if you own the Evolution, there is NO REASON why you should not own this head."
3,Great concept but too hard,"This game is not for the faint of heart. Its an older game so dont expect superb graphics.. but then again graphics don't make every game.The concept of this game is great and was done much better in the 'sequel' Warhammer : Dark Omen. In this game you command a mercenary army and control it during battles. Over time more and more 'units' join your army. The problem is affording the upkeep for the army... and you are not supplied sufficient reinforcements for the massive number of casualties you will incur. At first it is of reasonable difficulty but within a dozen battles you are almost at impossible odds.If you are a hardcore fan of strategy games, try it out, but I highly suggest Dark Omen over this as it maintains a challenge, but not impossibility."
1,old stars are not the same,This is a joke. There is no comparison between the early band and this junk.You would not even recognize Jim Dandy.The voice is gone and the --99 is added becausethe earlier song has been lost or is non existent.Do not waste your money.I hope I can return it.RIP OFF says it best
1,A sad legacy,I am a Black Oak Arkansas fan going back to the seventies. I've enjoyed all of their CDs by the original line up(s). This CD is terrible. I am not going to give a song by song run down as its all bad. The remakes sound like a boring lounge band doing poor quality covers. The other songs lack any creativity or originality. All in all the CD is dull with nothing that even hints at Black Oak Arkansas. If you are a Black Oak fan steer clear of this CD all together. It is not worth a listen. If you are not a Black Oak fan this CD has nothing to offer anyway. I recommend their first couple CD's or Ain't Life Grand to get you started. BOA is worth checking out but this CD is not.
4,Don't Stop the Carnival,"This review might be biased since I have been a rabid Belafonte fan for many years. This wonderful tape is a reminder of the concerts he has given, and lets me relive those pleasant moments, although short and infrequent that he comes to town."
2,Could have been better without it,"Every series needs a conclusion--but this series would have been just fine without this book. The characters didn't feel well developed, the whole story felt rushed and phony. I thought the daughter was extremely annoying, even after she ""finds God"" and gets her life in some sort of order.I really enjoyed Cavanaugh's other novels, but I can't stand this one. If you get to book seven and feel like you need a conclusion still, go ahead and read this book. But I can tell you now that you won't find the wonderful ending you would expect from Cavanaugh."
4,Great for Sixties History lesson,"I thought this was an excellent overview of the Sixties era. In fact I'm going to have my homeschool teens read it for historical value. It most certainly should keep their attention, as we were just discussing this particular time period, and then I came across the book and read it myself. I thought this book sums up the period pretty succinctly and does it in an entertaining way."
2,Most of the light shoots out the side instead of down on the page,"When holding this over something I am trying to read in the dark, and looking through the clear lens, the light ends up coming out of the left side of the lens and going across the room, and not down on the page. I ended up taking the lens off and now I can just shine it straight down without the lens. Of course now the magnifier is gone, but it wasn't very good to begin with."
3,Screwdriver problem,"Within a month of owning the Gerber multi-plier, the tip on the lg flat blade screwdriver broke off under NORMAL USE. No other problems in the last 6 yrs of usage."
2,Very disappointed,"The foam inside the mat is so soft that it offers no cushion from the hard floor. Also, when the mat is unfolded, the gaps between the cushions are rather wide and only covered in thin vinyl. It is really not much like the one in the photo."
5,Like the proverbial frog in hot water,Got into my Hot springs Jetsetter II and noticed no bubbles coming up. Thought maybe my circ pump had died. Opened up the service panel and the pump was fine. Called my dealer and she said that 95% of the time it was a dirty filter blocking the water flow. I took the recirc filter off and away everything went.I had been cleaning the filters as needed but after 4 years I guess they croaked. Put these new filters and was amazed at how strong the jets were. The old filters just slowly became blocked and I didn't notice.
4,Hot tub filters,This type replaced the other harder material filters.This one beats them all.Great at catching all the oils that you naturally lose in the spa.Well worth the investment.
1,"Down with the ""New"" Tubsider","The ""new"" Tubsider is a shadow of its former self. We had the original Tubsider for years and we adored it. Eventually one of my boys broke ours and I searched high and low to replace it eventually calling Infantino and being told that it was being improved and would come out soon. I bought the new and improved model immediately and have been cursing the day that I threw the pieces of the old away ever since. Problems with this product include 1) the gel pads do not stay put and are not very forgiving, 2) the height of the seat is all wrong for both my husband (who is average height) and me (I am short) and cannot really be adjusted 3)the seat comes off every time you try to move the contraption out of the way 4)when you try to move it all of the pieces go in different directions as they have made it too flexible for its own good. Compared to not having a Tubsider at all this product certainly helps but it needs a lot of work."
1,No taste,"Very unhappy with this purchase. There was essentially no taste. The crust was basically flour with a little salt added, the ingredients on the inside of the bread tasted mass-produced. Combined with the extremely high shipping costs, this is a very poor product. If they sent me another one for free I would put it in the trash, it is just not worth eating."
3,"Not as good as expected but is was ""decent"".","After ordering the ""Stuffed Italian Breads"" from Pittman and Davisfor the past 25 years, each Christmas, I came across what seemed to be ""the same"" typeof product at a far lower price.We really were disappointed! While it was good, the P&D; one is GREAT.I guess the adage of ""you get what you pay for"" is true and it will be back to the Pittman and Davis one next year, regardless of the cost."
4,Arrived in Pieces,"I was really excited to order this for my husband's birthday. We had been to Scotland on our honeymoon and he really developed a taste for whisky. Unfortunately, the decanter arrived in several pieces. The outside brown box came perfectly intact. But once I opened that, the inner Reed & Barton boxed looked like someone gave it a couple of kicks. Hard to understand why someone would take care to place an obviously beat up box in the middle of padded packaging. Very disappointed that my husband will not have his gift for his birthday.EDIT: After calling and speaking to costumer service at Amazon, they one day shipped me a new decanter. The second one arrived in excellent condition and my husband loved the gift. Changed my review from one star to four stars. Would have given five stars if the original hadn't come severely damaged."
4,Gilmore Wheelpump Sprayer,"My sprayer broke after 2 years. The plastic cam follower tabs both broke off. After I opened it up, I realized that Gilmore gives you an extra set of cam followers, on the back of the cam follower assembly. You just need to remove and replace some screws to turn it around and use the second set of cam followers, which restores it to like new. It is obvious to me being an engineer that you do not want to rotate these wheels at any more than a slow walk speed, because the force due to liquid damping on the cam followers is directly proportional to the wheel speed, and too much force will break them. The full equation of motion, ma+cv+kx=Fe explains this phenomenon."
3,"I have not had to use it yet, however","I purchased this service plan for peace of mind and I have not had to use it yet. However, I was supposed to get a document stating the details of the service plan through the mail and did not receive it for a month. I finally called the 800 number and they said that there was nothing to be sent through the mail and that if I need service to call the customer service number. They did finally ask for information on the TV (you figure that would be kinda important), but only after I called twice and insisted they know about the product they are actually covering. I hope I never have to use this service plan, but god help me if I do. Beware of poor customer service."
1,Check your credit card protection first!,"Most credit cards (Amex, Visa) offer loss and damage protection, and extended warranty protection. Amex, for example, doubles the manufacturer's warranty up to and for at least 1 year.Research your credit card benefits before investing 20-25% of the product cost in extended warranty protection. I think it's worthless."
3,Nice,"We bought this a year ago..is pretty easy to put up. Easiest to do if you have 4 people to help..one for each leg. My only negative about it is that we had it set up while camping, only two of us at camp, a wind came up and by the time the two of us got it lowered some of the trusses had bent very badly. It no longer fits into the roller bag! It is still usable as it is, but takes a little more time to set up now and is harder to haul without the bag."
4,Better than the first book,"This book is probably the best of the series. The characters are more evolved and the action picks up. As a reader, you start to develop which characters are you favorites and whom you want to ""win"" in this ultimate battle for control of the labyrinth. I will admit though, that there are still components of this book that don't sit too well with modern readers, but that is to be expected with a series that is spanning millennia.I will admit to writing this review after I have read the entire series. My reason for admitting that is to let the reader know the quality of this book compared to the others. This one is the best with the final book being second."
4,Great story but. . .,"The errors in grammar and punctuation throughout the text drove me nuts and took away from my enjoyment of the story. And look at the title: Gods' Concubine? No, no, no! It should be God's Concubine, the name Caela's husband King Edward gave her."
3,shipping trouble,my order was placed on dec. 24. 2 and 1/2 weeks later the arrival date was changed to jan. 28 - feb 10.i think anyone will agree that that is unacceptable for shipping
5,Good knife for an electritians needs.,"This 3"" long knife is the perfect size to fit into your tool belt. Others have taken umbrage with the short blade, however as an electrition, it is the perfect length for slicing down the center of romex. I have had mine for over six months (a testimate to the fact that I do my best to not loose it) and it has yet to get dull. Furthermore, the serated edge works perfectly for fileting the insulation of high guage wire and SE cable. If you're an electrition or you have similar needs to those listed above, then this is the knife for you. I have seen this for $9.99 at my local hardware store. You cannot beat this knife at that price. jay."
5,A great experience and wonderful cookbook,"I love Asian cuisine...especially regional Indian cooking. Heather's restaurant in Minneapolis is a jewel. I love hot food, but Sri Lankan hot food is in a different category. It is ubber spicy. This cookbook is a must for Indian curry lovers. Sri Lankan food is just different enough from Indian, you won't feel that anything in this book is duplicative to your Indian cookbooks. Highly recommended book, and please go to the restaurant if you get to Minneapolis!"
1,Really Dumb Things you can do with your Social Security Number,This book covered very basic information on how your credit report works & offered some very dubious ways to clear it up. For example: Change your social security number. I'm pretty sure there are some illegal things going on with that!
3,This is one dark Trek novel.,"Crazy body takovers? Rape? Issues a little little heavy for lightweight reading like Trek novels.Predictable, yet interesting story. I wouldn't recommend it for younger readers or abuse survivors, though. Just too dark."
2,Merry has some tough decisions to make,"In this 5th book of Summerhill, the finding of the abandoned baby as well as developements between Levi and Jon all give Merry fits. The boyfriend dilemna works fine, but the solution to the baby is weak, not too believable, and deducts a lot of credibility from this otherwise good book. I hope Beverly Lewis will improve on her mystery solutions."
4,Gilmour W4 Spray Doc 4-Gallon Wheel Pump Sprayer,"I loved using this sprayer. I have used it 3-4 times since I purchased it and it worked wonderfully. I really didn't need 4 gallons and have only had a max of 3 in it at one time. Amazon had a great price and I could have gotten the 2 gallon elsewhere but, I would have paid more for it including shipping and tax. So, the 4 Gallon from Amazon was by far the best deal.Pros: 4 Gallon Tank, Pressurize by rollling - NO PUMPING, Hose Length OK, Good Spray Distance and control, Good Pressure.Cons: Would like a bit more length on the hose and maybe a littler longer wand. If you have alot of spraying your hand gets a bit tired but, hey, with NO Pumping it is great!I gave 4 stars only because it would get 5 if the hose and wand were longer for the price. Overall, it is a great sprayer and will let you get it all done much quicker than if you had a 1 or 2 Gallon Pumping Sprayer. Good Deal at Amazon."
3,Good Sprayer but...,"This is a good sprayer when compared to other sprayers on the market. However, I found that the pressure was not as good as I expected. My use is for spraying larger areas such as driveways and paths rather than spot spraying of individual weeds. The lack of pressure just didn't work for me. I returned the product."
1,Defective Product,"I purchased the Gilmour 4-Gal Wheel Pump Sprayer in Jan 2006. I filled it with Round-Up and used it to spray weeds around our 2 1/2 acres. The second time I filled it, it sprung a leak somewhere near the wheel base, and sprayed Round-Up everywhere, including my pants and shoes. Fortunately, I was on concrete at the time, and didn't kill any lawn or plants. This could have been hazardous had it gotten into my face or eyes. I do not recommend this product."
1,Save your money!,If I could rate this a zero - I would. This is supposed to be a self pump sprayer. I was only able to spray 2 little annuals before it died out. Had to walk all over the creation to be able to spray an additional annual. Tried again to walk around to get it to pump - same thing - sprayed 1 annual. Complete waste of time. I had to go back to the ole watering can. Save your money - this product is garbage. Nifty idea - bad engineering.
2,Not Much Ooomph,"This seems like a decent quality but there is not much volume that comes out of this product. Good if you want to give your plants a spritz but not if you are planning on giving them a good watering. Takes a very long time to get enoug water out to soak something.The pump mechinism is decent, seems to keep charged for a decent amount of time. May be better for spraying weed killer."
4,Love it,I bought this sprayer 2 weeks ago and just used it last week. We have a large yard and I used the sprayer to spray for dandelions with a 2-4D product. I loved it. THe hose could be about 10--12 inches longer though. I just bought another sprayer to use on our 12 acres of mountain property. My husband has a lot of weed spraying to do there and this will help on the frequent stops for filling and pumping not to mention the sore arms and wrist from hauling a regular sprayer.
1,3.1.2022,"As with most products you buy nowadays, they just don't make them like they used to. After very limited usage, the pressure decreased as time went on...and not a lot of time. The last time I used it, I had just mixed up a 4 gallon batch of roundup and was off to the races. About half way to the point where I was going to begin to spray, the handle came out of the retainer (the screw cap). Naturally, being full of mixture, the lower unit fell forward. About a gallon of mixture spilled out on the front lawn and the grass is still struggling to get back to normal a year later. I think I will try something else next time we go shopping. As usual, THEY TALK THE TALK...THEY JUST DON'T WALK THE WALK."
1,Sprayer not worth it,"I would not buy this. pressure problems, etc. good idea but best to look for something else"
5,Great Product,Received this innovative sprayer in rapid satisfactory condition. What a concept to spray wirhout ever pumping. The older you get you need energy saving products such as this. We have a large piece of property we continually spray. This is a great time and energy saver for us.
3,gilmore sprayer,"I like the sprayer for the convenience of not having to carry or manual pump, but you continue having to push the sprayer in a circle to keep up the pressure."
1,Good idea with apparent functional problems,"Reviews for this sprayer were either very good or very bad, so I went ahead and ordered one on 3/1 to have it on hand for spring and tried it for the first time on 5/14. The pumping mechanism on mine is apparently defective. After rolling the sprayer around 100 feet, I had enough pressure built up for a low pressure spray for 3-4 seconds. I finally had to resort to rolling the sprayer several feet back and forth with one hand while trying to spray with the other in order to generate and maintain a minimal amount of pressure. This provides a pretty good workout but does a poor job of spraying. Since I ordered the sprayer early and did not try it for over 1 month, I can no longer return it to Amazon. After I am able to use up the 3 gallons of herbicide currently in the sprayer, I will not use it again."
1,Gilmour W4 Sprayer,"The idea and design of this sprayer is great, however the day I received it I tried it out and it did not work! I rolled it over 80 feet started to spray and a spit came out.I was very upset to learn it cost me over $30 to return something that was faulty. Gilmour should have reimbursed me the return shipping cost."
1,Poor product,"Have to walk pretty fast to keep the pressure, even when full. When I do that on my driveway, the handle snapps off, leaving the tank to drop to the ground and all the liquid comes pouring out. The flange that holds the handle to the ring, which attaches to the tank, is too narrow. Very poor design. Also, I can only spray when I walk fast. I can't linger around a spot, because the pressure goes down and nothing comes out. Then I stand in one place pushing and pulling that thing back and forth. Not worth the money."
5,fantastic sprayer,An excellent product that is easy to set up and easy to use. It is much more practical than a hand held or backpack sprayer and allows for more spraying in less time.
4,NIFTY GADGET!!!,"This is one of the best, most useful items I have purchased in the last couple of years. I live on 5 acres and need to do a lot of spraying. With a bad back, carrying and continually pumping up those 3 gallon units was a real pain.The wheel pump works great! The hose is a little long and occasionally gets caught under the turning wheels. The only reason I didn't rate it a 5 is because they were stingy with the wand -- it needs to be at least 5 or 6 inches longer, so a person doesn't have to bend over while spraying. And for the price they charge, the wand should be made of metal with a brass nozzle, not plastic."
4,The GREATEST Garden Toy Ever,"This is FANTASTIC, one fill-up, ""no pumping"" ever, no more backache, no more multiple trips to refill it, where has this been all my gardening years?!? Only suggestion for improvement, it needs WIDE WHEELS or BIG WHEELS, would make the moving about with it much smoother and easier. BUT I LOVE IT anyway........."
3,Nice size,It is great that it hold 4 gallons and it does not have to be carried. My issue is that it loses pressure very quickly.
1,Does not make or keep pressure well. Too much work!,"The Wheel Pump is not making or holding pressure. I had this problem from the first month I had it. I only get a few seconds of spray. I'm spending a rediculous amount of time walking it around my 3 acre back yard. The wheels lock up and I am often dragging it around my yard cursing at it! Only one wheel is pressurizes the tank, so if you are walking on a hill, you must have good contact with that wheel. One gallon does not seem to be enough weight to cause wheels to pressurize. Also beware that the top of the tank is open where you store the spray wand. If the unit tips over, which can happen easily on non-level terrain or if you pull it off balance with the spray wand, the solution spills out. What a waste of seventy dollars. I called Gilmour and they said they would send me another sprayer, but I had to pay shipping to them. I told them no thanks."
4,"Jennifer is intrigued by ""The Bride Who Died""","Jennifer is feeling a bit pressured to express her feelings for Sam Culpepper, so she distracts him by trying to get information about a recent lurid death. Suzanne Gray has committed suicide by freezing to death on her fiancee's grave. Something doesn't seem right to her about the murder and she is determined to find out what really happens. The next day Sam's engagement announcement is in the paper, and she isn't in the announcement. Sam's old flame Belle, a tabloid reporter is staying with him claiming that a mobster is trying to kill her, the reason for the bogus announcement. Something is not quite right about Belle, another mystery for Jennifer to solve.I really enjoyed this novel. It moves incredibly fast and all of the plot lines mesh well. I am looking forward to the next installment in the series."
5,so nice!,"I purchased this book as a gift and my husband loves it so much! This book is just perfect, full of pictures, you know, so you can locate Borbeaux or Champagne! It gives a really good general idea on the wine world and is full of informations. After our last trip to Lyon, France my husband decided to learn more about wines and this book is the perfect first step for someone who is wanting to learn.Great buy."
4,Wonderful Resource. A No-brainer choice.,"What make's Zraly's book so good is that he cuts to the chase. The relevant information one needs to appreciate the quintessence of a wine are gotten to very quickly.The vast majority of people-especially those attempting to immerse themselves into the world of wine for the 1st time-do not need superfluous information that will confuse them. The success of Zraly's course is built on that premise.The course is full of interesting and relevant sidebars to be sure, but as it is patterned after a textbook that information literally is positioned in sidebars.If you are a wine lover, beginning or seasoned, you will appreciate this book. I sell wine, and thus need a working knowledge of the world of wine and I've found this book invaluable.Buying this book is a no-brainer."
5,a wine guide for all,"I bought this for a friend because I own it. I am a wine professional and have a fair amount of wine knowledge. I find this a great reminder and guide for personal and professional use. For my friend, it is an introduction into wine. He knows very little and this book is written for all levels of wine knowledge. It's easy to understand and practical. Kevin Zraly has probably forgotten more about wine than I will ever know and has written a great guide for people who are passionate about wine."
3,Needles to Hook,this book is a good on but thought that it took longer than necessary to get here. My payments are always immediate.
3,Deals with mature subject matters and it is very sad.,"This book, ""Life With Billy"" is intended for adult readers. It deals with mature subject matters and readers discretion is strongly advised. To think that stuff like this happens in this world, not to mention that it is a true story, what is this world coming to any way. Billy, however, got what he deserved, not implying that violence is the answer but no one should be treated in a way the poor mother did. Billy was a disgrace to all men. There are men out there that treat women with respect and dignity and he definitaly was not one of them. This book was an insight of actual domestic violence and reading about it sends shivers down my spine. I just hope that children don't get their hands on the novel and actually read from it. I feel so sorry for the poor boy who went through all this."
2,Not as good as Ralph Shaw's other CD's,I bought this CD because I liked the other two CD's by Ralph Shaw. But this CD was no where as good. I was quite disappointed and felt the CD did not deserve the price.
4,Several good features,"Has features not always found on other light magnifiers.Pretty colorsLight can be set to stay onSmall, has own compact caseAvailable in several sizesLightWedge Original LED Book LightLightWedge Paperback LED BooklightThis size does not cover large area is difficult for some people to use."
1,Very poor design - difficult to connect and loses connection,The Malibu Fast Lock II connector is very poorly designed. It's both difficult to get proper alignment and squeeze together (i.e. requires significant tension with fingers causing some pain afterwards). After installation...the connectors often lose their grip which requires a re-install which is difficult once they gotten dirty/sued. This product seems to be designed for a short life (...we're not talking rocket science...surely there's the possibly of improving the design).
5,More fantastic art from Dan Brereton,"I love Dan's work, Nocturnals especially, and this book is no exception. This is probably the spookiest of the Nocs stories, and features some of the best art in the series. Amazing read, well worth your time and money."
5,Well Worth the Cost,"If you're looking for a holiday trip down memory lane, then this cd is for you. It evokes a simpler time from the 1950's and 60's when Baby Boomers were young. Over the years Reader's Digest has put together serveral excellant; and very hard to find selections, and this does not disappoint. It arrived within a week using standard delivery; and I highly recommend it."
4,This game is so cool! Next to Zelda windwaker,"Oh man...I LOVE this game. I rented it from Hollywood video and I am so glad I did. I wasn't sure if I would like it or not because I had played it on the X-Box and I didn't like it at all. But when I played it on GC, I thought that the game was so fun! I guess it was because the GC gave us some tips on how to do this and that while X-box didn't do that. Plus the X-box controller is so hard to handle. It's too big and the controls are hard. I am going to buy this game once the price goes down. This game is so cool!!!!!!!"
2,The tail of a joke,this game is a joke.The tail of the sun is not for someone who is serious about strategy games.I give this game a very low score on my never buy list.the graphics are somewhat lost in the 80's.
2,Does not age well,"This cart was great at first, but it has not held up over time. The problem is one of the wheels keeps coming off! Because the cart needs to fold, it does not have an axle. Instead, a screw attaches the wheel to a fitting that, with use, has lost its grip. This fitting is not welded (it's a friction fit) and it is this cart's Achilles heel!My recommendation is, unless you really need the folding feature, buy a cart with an axle."
5,Excellent quality product,"The garden cart is well made of stainless steel and marine grade aluminum. There is even a cup of grease provided for lubricating the axels & a sheet metal screwdriver to tighten the bolts that hold the wheels on.Putting the wheels on and installing the front gate - is the only assembly that is required. The cart does not come with the rear gate - as is pictured in the listing.The ""bicycle"" type tires are not a problem in the sandy soils here in northern Florida.Enjoy!Norman"
5,Wife loves it,"Gave this cart to my wife, she loves it's light weight and storability. It folds to be neatly put away in very little space. Great product and well worth it."
5,TIPKE Marine Folding Utility Cart,"Bought it for a garden cart to replace the wheelbarrow that was 30 years old...love it and it takes up so little room when not in use. Although this item is a little expensive, believe that due to the construction material, it will last a lifetime. It's also nice to NOT have to fight the balancing act required when using a normal wheelbarrow. - GAC"
1,Definitely second rate,"This cart came without any instructions. There is a huge aluminum burr on the reset button. I tried to put it together without the manual. No surprise, I cut my thumb. I had to call the manufacturer (not toll-free) for a manual which I've finally received, but the cart still seems sub-par. I will have to file off the burr so I won't cut myself again. This seems to be a reject or irregular from the manufacturer. Very sorry that I bought it, but it may well work out as useful in the end, just hoping since I've spent so much."
2,Not for todays exams,This book does not help out anyone who already has a high school education. The book contains elementry practice tests that are NOT useful for tests given in this era of recruitment.
4,Golf tees,The quality is good but the color is not really purple - they are more of a dark blue with a slight hint of purple to them.
3,Great Series - Out of Date Book,"I've used these books in the past for most of my travels and have been very pleased. During a previous trip to Rome, I used an earlier edition Access Rome book as my Bible. It was extremly informative and useful. Unfortunately, since then they have changed the design of the maps and have not updated the book accurately. Many of the places I tried to visit had been long gone, inaccurately positioned on the map, or the descriptions were not appropriate. Unless they changed these items for the 8th edition, I would warn against using this book as a primary source of information. Also, the maps did not incorporate the locations of the Metro stops and Taxi stands into the neighborhood maps, like other travel guides have, which I found to be a neccessity for travel around Roma."
1,Complete disappointment,"When people talk Access these days, especially in travel, it is expected that special needs are covered, especially wheelchair accessibility. There is barely a mention. I gave the book to the local garage sale. I should have saved my money and googled."
2,Alas,"This album was a disappointment. Her voice sounds quite harsh. Get ""Spring"" or ""My Foolish Heart"" instead."
2,Can't find any heads,I have looked every where for the different heads but I can't find them any for sale. Every where I do find them they say they don't make them so its pointless to buy this tool. And it does not fold up which SUCKS big time.
4,Gerber Revolution,"Fantastic functionality. A myriad of tools that lock in place with no wiggle-room. The interchangable heads lock firmly into place. I only wish there were some way to lock the handles together when using, say, the screwdriver as opposed to having to squeeze the whole time."
5,"A fantastic, refreshing album!","I've heard the term ""Heavy Soul"" thrown around a lot when talking about Maktub, and it seems to fit. This is lush R+B/neo soul with touches of rock guitar and feedback. After wading through dozens of cookie-cutter pop-punk and emo bands, it's great to hear a band just do what they want without trying to fit into one specific genre. The result...it certainly works for me! The band and arrangements are super tight, but the thing that hits me the most are the vocals. You really, really have to be able to sing to pull of a style like this, and luckily Maktub's vocalist is more than up to the task. The production in spots reminds me of some 90s R+B, and while I wasn't a fan of much of that stuff, in this context it works really well. The songs are thick with pumping bass and kick drum and topped off with crunchy guitar and warm-sounding keyboard/organ. I'm very happy I bought this, it's a great album and I listen to it frequently. Highly reccomended!"
5,A Fantastic Home Educating Resource,"While Five In A Row cannot be described as a complete curriculum, it IS a fantastic resource. The lessons included for each story are great ""jumping-off"" points. I don't typically do all of the suggested activities but use the activities as a place to start. Then we take off in whatever direction we choose, following the interests of my 5yr old. In my opinion, $20 is an inexpensive investment for something that is going to be the starting point for my lessons each week. I have not spent money on much else for home educating this year.I *do* think that Five in a Row requires more planning & creativity on the part of the parent than a ""boxed"" curriculum would. If you are looking for something that has absolutely everything included in the book, Five in a Row is probably not the right choice for you."
5,Excellent! Easy! What more could you want?,"We thoroughly enjoy our Five in a Row experience. In addition, most of the books are listed in Bennett's ""The Educated Child"" as must reads. Our daughter particularly enjoys the science and social studies; and remembers most of what she learns. I spend about 1/2 hour planning the week, and I enjoy what we do also! Thanks, Lamberts!"
2,Not what I was expecting....,"I may upgrade this after I actually utilize this. However, I have read through the book & it is not what I was expecting. My plans for this are to teach my Kindergartener & sometimes include my 2nd grader as well. I was hoping for more concrete FUN ideas for each book... This does give some good educational tools. don't get me wrong. But I really thought when we studied the books there would be at least one fun project directed just at that book.... Something a kindergartener would love. Anyway, I will add more to this after we have used it awhile."
5,Wonderful book for 5 - 7 year olds.,If you are homeschooling and want one book that does it all...this is it. It is a wonderful book that won't leave you feeling like there is sooooo much to cover. It is filled with lots of activities based on books that you read. I highly recommend it for the little guys!
4,Best Insane Poetry Album,"This is such a well rounded album: lifestory songs, rugged street songs, horrorcore, throwback hip-hop. You can listen to this record from beginning to end. Good production by JP Tha Hustler, and good features by other GRE artists (who I think are all gone from the label at this point). My favorites are ""Boys In A Box"" and ""Kill You."" Insane Poetry has been legendary since 1992's Grim Reality album. They don't disappoint on this one."
2,Heavy weight,Iron is too heavy and you must manually turn on the steam when you want to use it. does have good steam action
5,Helped Shape Me,"Sean McConnell is absolutely amazing. His songs ""Strangers"" from this album and ""Greater Mistake"" and ""I Found It"" from his album ""Faces"" really touched me. I first heard him in Murfreesboro at Bonhoffer's. His shows were always packed. He is great singer/songwriter. I think he is one of my favorites."
1,Brita Disposable Filter,Difficult to install and needs re-tightening after one or two uses.Not satisfactory.
2,Nice Try,Nice idea but item only lasted a month before the red light for the filter came on -rather than a year. I did not over use it either. I washed my hands about once a day and when I brushed my teeth I would only turn it on to rinse my toothbrush. Also the fountain part doesn't work anymore either. Maybe a factor of the filter being dirty there isn't enough pressure for it. I plan on contacting Brita on this matter. See what they say.
3,perhaps this is over my head?,"while i wanted to love this album, i have only grown to like it well enough. it has alot of charm and personality, and Doom's voice is so great, recalling a melding of the lazy, smokey slur of Guru with the marble-mouthed delivery of Sensational. the music is also pretty cool, but really busy and i get a bit of an overstuffed feeling from it. too many samples, too much noise clouding up the beats. i guess i like my hip hop a little more spread out on the sonic pallette. the songs are very quick little snippets that come across more like unfinished business rather than a fully realized album. god, i want to like this more because there are some great things about this recording...but it has yet to really bowl me over."
3,Good but NOT great,"Not sure why everyone gave this 5 stars. MF Doom...I mean Madvillain has displayed an almost lazy showing here. Some great tracks while others are simply boring. I miss the days of ""selling rhymes like dimes."""
2,Again..................WTF?,"2 stars period. I like the album cover, Doom and Madlib, and tracks 2 and 22. The rest of the album is straight up booty. I do not understand the concept of the two illest underground cats in the game making such colorful gar-bage. I mean, WTF??????? Why was Doom singing on ""Rainbows""? That ish ain't hittin. This album sounds like they were in the booth together on that white ish. Don't buy, and don't get high off yo own supply. I like Doom and Madlib, but this album gets the e-bay treatment!!!!Peace!!!!!!!!"
5,Truly a Great Role Model!!,"I met Ms. Weiner at my local bookstore when she came to my town to promote this book. She is exactly like she is in her book, very outgoing and bubbly. I came away from her book signing with not only her autograph but a fire in me that I have not had in years. She is truly inspiring. This is a wonderful book for anyone not happy with their body."
2,not as pretty as it looks,The shoe does not look as fabulous as the picture. It appears to have a goldish rosy look online but it's more of an antique gold. The strap is also a little flimsy.
1,where are the rest of books I ordered?,"I have ordered two sets of three volume set book of 'Physical Metallurgy'Physical Metallurgy, Fourth Edition (Three Volume Set)last November. Last week Friday two books from one set (vol. 1 & 2) were delivered to my address, where are the rest of FOUR books? The service has been very slow and incomplete, please confirm the delivery from Amazon was proper.regards, Yujie Dong"
3,Fun yet simple,My boys just didn't seem to latch on to this as much as I had hoped. The black light on it was fun--money testing and glow in dark stuff. Build quality on these were good for the price.
5,Great book!!,"I was so involved with Winter Hill's plot, I finished reading it in 2 days! As soon as I turned the last page I started it over, now taking my time to enjoy the drama little by little, since the hunger to know the fate of all characters has been satiated.Great book, great story! I can't wait until Matthew Farrell comes out with another suspense!"
3,Good product... if you get a great deal!!!,"I have to disagree... this phone is very easy to navigate. Pretty much like all the other Motorola phones I've owned.My only issue with this phone (other than the phone service) - is it completely died after only 3 mos. So far the replacement is OK, but who know how long that will last??? When I say died... it wouldn't even turn on!!! FYI- keep all your #'s stored to the SIM as well as the phone. It's a pain to have duplicates, but worth it since you can't assign ring tones to #'s unless it's stored to the phone. Lesson learned!!!Although the phone itself is nice to look at- even the blue tooth technology is another expense. You have to purchase that headphone separately... and I paid HOW much for this thing?! If you get an amazing deal, then it's a good phone. Otherwise, the few extra features you get aren't worth it."
1,Dust under the screen,"The problem with this phone is that some white dust gets accumulated under the screen. I exchanged the first one and got a new one because of this reason. Now the new one also started getting the ""white"" dust under the screenAlso my friend's and coworker's phones have this dust. Some of them very badly like 1/3 of the screen is covered by this dust.Apart from this everything looks good."
4,durable,I have used this phone for a year before switching to a new one. It still waits to be used as a back up handset. Worth the buy.
1,AWFUL PHONE,"THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST PHONE I HAVE EVER OWNED. I PURCHASED IT MARCH 16, 2006 AND I HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH IT EVER SINCE AND T-MOBILE WILL NOT DO ANYTHING TO RESOLVE THE SITUATION. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE."
1,Great Phone but Buzzes on Incoming Calls,I recently got a RAZR V3 from T-Mobile and it has a great look and feel. Unfortunately it makes a loud buzzing noise on incoming calls. I exchanged it for another RAZR V3 and am still having the same problem.
4,Best Cell I Ever Had,"Cell Phone is great!Pros: Great function features, very cool style, no antenna, internal and external display.Cons: Video time is too short, a little to wide, could not hide numbers secretly, no flash feature for night camera shots.Suggestions: needs to have a self destruction feature when loosing phone due to all the picture memory and video clips."
2,"New look, old technology","This is an address book? It gives you a separate listing, or line, for each phone number. No addresses or notes. So if your contact has four #s, you get four separate listings.Phone numbers are listed by first name then last name. That's it, not filed by last name first. Hey, we're not all in high school where we look up our contacts by their first name.No memory card. So if you have more phone #s than the phone's memory (I think it's 1000 or 2000 #s), just cull them out, because they won't fit on your phone.Unless all your numbers are on the SIM card (rather than phone memory), which limits it now to 100 or 250 #s depending on the SIM card, no way you're gonna get speed dial to work.The font used by the phone is a throwback to a decade or more ago. Not pretty to read.The alarm clock is a pain to use. You can set five alarm clocks, and I like the eight minute snooze, but you must reset the alarm each day, and it takes a few steps."
1,BEWARE! Choose a different provider,"BBB Reliability ReportThe Better Business Bureau of Washington State processed a total of 11566 complaints about this company in the last 36 months, the standard reporting period.Of the total of 11566 complaints closed in 36 months, 5461 were closed in the last year.The company has an unsatisfactory record with the bureau.PROS Free (reduced price) phone. 1 year (2-year with Cingular or others) contract.CONS Frequent network outages and technical glitches. Horrendous customer service.Go with another carrier. Or be writing a similar review soon."
2,RAZR V3 - THE WORST PHONE,I am now on my 2nd RAZR V3 in the last 10 days. The 1st phone had an annoying humming noise from the ear piece and alot of static.I now have my replacement and though the phone has yet to start humming everyone sounds like static.I should have continued using my Motorola 722I that I have had for the past 3 years.......Everyone sounded very clear.
3,"it's okay, i guess..","I like this phone in general, but minor thing that bothers me is that whenever I touch the phone, I leave fingerprints all over this phone, and I find this very annoying. In addition, it does not seem to have a ""profile"" function like other nokia units."
4,Good but...,"Hi,First things first..Pros -- the phone is a great thing to show-off. It does look cool and attract attention.Cons -- Coming from a non-motorola world, I definitely have cons with the user interface.1. Mentioned time and again, the duplicate entries in the address book for different phone num's of same name is definitely an eye-sore (and finger-sore too once u start searching the phonebook).2. The ""recently called""/""received call"" list does not display the time of the call right away(though its only a click away).. It just displays the list of caller id's/name's.3. If I set an alarm, there is no icon/indicator on the home screen which tells me that an alarm is activated for xx:xx timeThese might possibly be trivial, but goes a long way in enhancing the user experience.Might hold on to the phone for probably a year until a better one comes by.."
1,not available in 24 hours.,"the phone is great... 5 stars. this has taken a week and a half just to ship it out of the warehouse. i need my phone faster than that. come on amazon, get it together."
3,Motorola RAZR V3 Phone (T-Mobile),IT IS JUST OKAY. IT IS THIN VERY THIN BUT VERY LONG. I WANT A SMALL AND THIN PHONE. I HAVEN'T TRIED ANYTHING ON THE PHONE BUT I GUESS I LIKE IT. I CAN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT THE RECEPTION.
2,Motorola V3 Razr,"This phone looks cool and that's about the only good feature I can think of.I bought this phone because it was ""cool"" and quickly realized that it was far more than I needed or wanted. If you just want a phone to make calls on, do not buy this phone.Aside from all of the bells and whistles, the reception is HORRIBLE! The very first call I made, the connection kept cutting out and it was extremely frustrating.This phone is very thin but it's also wider than you might expect. It is hard to hold the phone comfortably because it's so wide.My phone came with several wallpapers (some were animated) and very few ringtones. It came with several alarm-type sounds but only 3 actual ring tones.I took this phone back the next day because I realized that it was not worth the $200 I paid for it, and it was way more than I needed in a phone. If you just want a plain old phone, this isn't it."
4,Motorola Razr,"One thing which REALLY bugs me about this phone is that it's cabable of video playback (it can download) but you can't record from the phone! I don't understand why especially since the technology is obviously there. Perhaps I should have done my homework first.It's my first Motorola (always had a Nokia before) and there's a couple more things which don't impress me. When sending a text message you have to go through a few screens before the text message actually gets sent. Also if I'm writing a text message and I have to stop writing it for one reason or another, the message doesn't save in the memory (unlike Nokia), so that may take some getting used to.All in all though, I do like the sleek design and it lights up really well!"
3,Poor reception in the south...,"I moved from Baltimore to Louisiana after buying this phone. In a few words, it is terrible. I have noticed that people who have this phone with Cingular down here have better reception and no drop calls. If you get this phone and you live in the south, do not be with T-Mobile."
3,I like this product...,"The overall quality of this product is good and the price is very reasonable. I would buy this product again and recommend this product to someone who is looking for a good price and for a good quality garment. Not great, but for the price, good."
5,Awesome Game,Not Only do you get tow bat and feild against the game u can also verse friends too. Theres Home Run Derby and Springt Training. You can choose your team and stadium and in home fom derby you choose 10 players to face off and hit homerruns off of perfect pitches. This Game is Better than MLB 2001 and 2002!!!
3,Nice quality print but WAY too much curling,"Overall this printer provides nice crisp copies, but the incessant paper curling has convinced me not to buy another Brother laser printer. Any document more than 5 pages will end up either a jumbled mess, on the floor, or jammed in the printer. I'm just glad to see others have had the same problem and that it's not just me. I will go back to Samsung printers (I own a ML-1450 which I love)."
1,Cheaply made,This is a terrible product! I got it and only one side even worked... You can tell the company doesn't care about quality! Go with some Smith and Wesson 100s instead!
5,simple and easy to understand,"this book helped me a lot with my life and understanding the power of love, you will keep it just close to you to give you guidance and wisdom."
3,Metafisica 4 en 1 spanish Vol II,good insperational book goes with to much history but in a view is good to know from where everything is coming is better vol I but help you understand the universe work options and how we have to start been better for us primary.
4,The Obstinate Land,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Obstinate Land. I went to college in that part of the state, northwest Oklahoma. The author's grandparents homesteaded there and Keith also did a lot of research so that the historical facts are clear. Boys or girls in middle school would be given great characters to think about as they follow the struggles of this German immigrant family. It reads as a novel and the guy gets his girl in the end. While there are bandits and heartaches, there is also humor in the plot which makes the story flow nicely. RIFLES FOR WATIE, also by Keith, is even better and won the Newbery Medal."
1,My pig didn't take it,I am sorry to give a one star rate because it failed to save my pig. This product sounds wonderful for a sick pig as an essential supplement. But my poor pig didn't take it at all. It ended by my hand feeding with syringe. You know the result of forced feeding. It may be helpful if pig likes it. I do like that taste too.
1,Good product????,"I've been looking for a natural product to use on my combination skin & the salesperson at my local health foods store highly recommended this product because it is ""good."" I hated it to say the least... not as good as I was made to believe."
1,Cocoa Butter,This was not at all what I expected. It is very hard to soften without liquifying it. I wouldn't purchase it again. It was so hard and dried up I couldn't help but think it was very old.
4,smelling like hot fudge sundae,"I love that it is pure cocoa, absorbs fast, really makes skin smooth and I feel safe knowing there isn't any chemicals other lotions contain. Priced well. Packaging was different than shown. It came in hard form but I did not disolve it on stove like other reviewers suggested. I just rub it to my skin or in between my hands and it works out fine. Only negative after fresh shower I smell like hot fudge sundae but it fades away after it is absorbed throughly.I will continue to use this lotion."
5,Just great!,"I bought this book for my 9-year old granddaughter, and she could not put the book down. She asked that I get for her the next book in the series, she loved it so much! This is an excellent choice for a good reader that is 9-10 years old."
4,1:18 Mass Ferrari SuperAmerica diecast car,"I found this car to be very pleasing to the eye. Loved the bright aluminum wheels that contrasted with the rich deep red color of the car. I especially liked the clear plastic roof that could be moved up and back to sit fittingly on the trunk to make it a convertible. I preferred it in the position of a 60 degree angle for display. The only thing that I didn't like was the plastic front and trunk hoods. Hot Wheels has gone from all metal to this which didn't offset the car too much but would have preferred the car to be all metal. All in all, it still looked sharp and very sporty."
3,How can you complete a whole season with this game.,"Im starting to collect all the f1 games i missed out in the 90's and I brought F1 98. when I start the game, the main menu has a bad frame rate. Driving with the cars was horrible.in order for the car to turn at any corner neatly you have to brake while turning.F1 98 really went backward when bizzare creations left.visual sciences cant make any games good.they really make the graphics good though.If you want to find a good F1 games in the past,Dont get this one unless you want to collect the F1 games.F1 97 is a better game to play."
3,Insulated on-the-go salad container,I only used this once. It keeps the lettuce fresh and crisp and the dressing compartment closes tight. I didn't like that it was so tall. It was almost impossible to reach the bottom of the container with a regular fork.
5,Great transaction!!!,"Good album as a whole, can totally see where the Human League stuff that Martin Rushent produced after this got its start from. Some songs are not that great and I expected this to be more ""out-there"" post-punk than what it is but I'm happy with it as a whole."
4,Wilsonian Romp,"There really is not much for me to say on this one. It's just a fun ride. The kind you come to expect with Wilson. It is book you can read without having read the Cosmic Trigger books, but it helps."
1,Self serving claptrap,"This is a self serving account of WWII, starting with the tip off ""Let me tell you about the first man I ever killed."" Hogwash and sea stories. If you want to read an honest account of WWII in the Pacific by someone who is out to give a realistic account without building a myth around himself, read E. B. Sledge, With the Old Breed."
1,"Bad, at best.","Manchester not only failed to convey his experience lucidly or compellingly, but his writing was offencive and fustian at the same time. Each page became more agonizing as he lost the only true story (his experiences)under the ""tourist brochure like"" description of the islands of the Pacific War. He surly did not do his comrades or his generation justice with this tripe."
5,purchased as a gift,I purchased this book for a young girl that will be entering the Marinesin a few months...I have read the book and rate it five stars for the historicalcontent and and presentation.
3,Daughter doesn't like the taste,"My daughter is picky, so it may just be her, but she does not like the taste. We will probably not buy anymore after this."
3,Rainbow Chewable Tablets,Good product with one fatal flaw - the kids hate the taste. Of three one won't take them and the other two would like to switch to something else when these are used up. Too bad - it was a reasonable value but if they won't take them.......
5,My daughter likes them - look for the best price,"My almost 6 year-old daughter has been taking these for a few years, and she likes them. Seems like Amazon has a lot of buying options for the same product. Click a few to find the best price. This one was a great deal with a discount on subscribe and save."
3,Not for us--,Probably fine for others but not for us-- My 3 yo raw vegan son spit it out with a major yuck. I thought they were quite good - they tasted like smarties (yum)-- so I gave it a 3 star for not working for us. Probably a fine product though. I really like the company.
5,use a spice grinder and put it in something yummy!,The only problem people have is the taste....think outside the box people!! Take an extra 30 seconds out of your day and help your children be healthy. I like to put it in applesauce with cinnamon . Kids yogart is usually really sweet.
4,A must have for parents who are soccer illiterate,This is a perfect book for those of us who know absolutely nothing about the sport. A great resource that teaches the reader how to be prepared for all those Saturdays to come. Beautifully illustrated and very informative.
2,Terrible sound with no mid-range,"I am not sure why everyone has such a love affair with Bose speakers. Perhaps it is the marketing or the fact that the bass module produces a lot of bass (although it is not very accurate.) The largest problem with these speakers is that there is absolutely zero mid-range. The highs are decent and the lows are powerful, but there is nothing in the middle - zilch. Nada. I would not recommend buying these speakers. There are many better systems out there for the same money."
1,If you're looking for minimalism...,"I must have been under the false impression that ALL of Arvo Part's work since 1976 (around the time Fur Alina was written) was in the minimalist vein. Well, this recording is certainly not minimalist in any way, shape, or form.If you are looking for this type of recording, I would recommend you try Part's instrumental works (apart from those written before '76).This disc sounds more like neo-rennaisance madrigals and motets. If you are looking for a modern composer doing this type of work, look no further. However, if you are expecting another Fur Alina you will be greatly disappointed."
5,a good book...wonderful plot...romantic lovestory,"its a wonderful book.... very interesting plot... i really enjoyed the story very much... its a fantastic story of passion,determination and unforgetable love..."
2,Disappointing,"Really dumb story. I give it credit for not wasting 100 pages before introducing the creatures and being relatively short, but it rambles on forever with lots of meaningless drivel about the hero's cheating wife before the climax set back on the mountain as the hero battles the creatures while trying to find his lost hiking buddy. Try ""Naked Came The Sasquatch"" if you're looking for a bigfoot story."
4,Elmo,My son loves elmo and my daughter loves reading. The two of them sit together with books like these. Thanks
4,Great for the money,These were great for the money. They were not completely symetrical but they really served the purpose I bought them for.
1,So funny lookin,Don't waste your money. If you purchase a good suit the glasses usually come with the suit. Glad they were cheap.
4,great movie,this is a great movie about a young guy who is trying to play semipro hockey and falls in love with the coaches daughter.great movie if you like hockey or even if you don't.
4,Gets BORING-VERY BORING,"I played this game and i loved shooting, punching, kicking, piledriving, chainsawing, and bombing my opponent into oblivion, but after about an hour, the death and stuff gets boring. An occasional suprise bombing or gorey fatality may liven it up, but the game seems to be a bunch of the same stuff. The sport itself is cool, you throw a metal ball aound towards a hologram ""net"". Don't buy this game for the weapons and gore. If you want that, buy Turok for N64. Basically, don't buy this game in hopes of playing it over and over and over, because it gets REALLY boring."
4,One way EasyPower,This item is only good for drilling. Don't try to use it in a reversible drill like I did that only opens the chuck as there is no way to lock it shut. Other than that it did what it was suppose to do on other projects.
1,BE CAREFUL!!!,"We bought this phone as a gift for our daughter (she loves everything pink). The phone is beautiful, the problem was that when we read the technical specifications on the web page it said bands 850-1800-1900 but when we received the phone: 1. First of all it had manuals in every Northern Europe language but no English or Spanish or Italian or anything we could understand, and 2. It specified in the box that the bands were 900-1800-1900 so we were not able to connect it where we live, so we had to return it."
5,If you need to relax don't read this book!,"I had to pick a book to read for school and this one cought my eye. I really liked it because it had a little of everything Ilike to read in it; it had mystery, sci-fi, and suspence. I did not know that there was a book before this one that had Liz in it,now that I know and that I have read this book I want to get the other one.To sum it all up, I thought that ""The Weekend Was Murder!"" was a great book."
2,Boring!,I know that most of you put 5 stars but I thought that the book was boring. The only reason I read it was because I had to for school. I love to read books but not this one. I had to force myself to read it and concentrate on what I was reading. I would rather read Lois Duncan's books than this one.
2,Oh my god!,"This game is not to good. It is slow, it has not to good graphics, and it has bad control with anolog or regular controllers."
5,"Twisted plot, beautiful ending.","The writing was slick, funny, and concise. The movie kept me waiting to see what happens next, but wishing the current scene would never end--especially the scenes with the assassin. The finale could not have been better written or better directed."
4,A interesting movie,"What I expected was a action movie but I found it to be more interesting than that. It's a 'real' movie and not a big noisy one.I think it's more like a good short story exercise. The plot is simple yet unpredictable since the audience tend to expect unrealistic fighting sequence as in a Hongkong movie.However it's not boring, the finale is a great sequence in cinematic sense and shows the real meaning of the movie."
3,Good for price,This game is not the greatest but for the price it's a good deal. The graphics are alright and it is an original. I bought it for the price though
3,Good fun and semi-addictive,"Definitely a great game for true casino gamers. There's about 20 different games to play, although some are very similar (e.g. different slot machines). I especially love the Video Poker game called Deuces Wild.Some of my complaints:(1) It takes too long to bet, play, and collect winnings. Annoying visualization effects are standable at first, but get frustrating after seeing ""Kyle Wins"" flash on the screen time after time.(2) The rating system is great overall, but it's IMPOSSIBLE to move up in Keno (duh...it's impossible to win!)(3) The cards are unreadable when the ""camera"" isn't zoomed in on that part of the table.All things considered though, the things wrong with the game are minimal making it a good deal."
4,Cool prog rock,"Very similar to old Yes stylings. I am enjoying it very much. No bad songs.Had time to listen more and where did I get Yes style from. Reminds more of Asia or Product. Very listenable, great vocals, great musicians, short songs. I'm in the process of purchasing their new CD."
4,Humor w/ info,"Its a great book giving ideas of how to gain control over your own health care & be an advocate for yourself in a polite respectable manner towards the medical team.It presents ideas with humor, along with identifying faults, problems, facts about the healthcare systems.I purchases this book the very week I Realized I will be seeing doctors often due to health concerns and I could already see that not much would be done if I didn't push for it. You the patient have to care for yourself & be smart.This book was very helpfulEva D"
5,You the smart patient,"I'm rather hesitant to leave a message, because when I do I get many messages from rude people.This book is worth the small amount I paid for it. I plan to buy several more and give them as gifts.It's a must have......"
3,"Everything but shipping, even when defective.","I purchased two Pyramid pb-700, back in my younger days I owned a pb-600 and it pounded so hard so I decided the 700 must be just as loud. Wrong, first off it's only a two channel when the pb-600 was 4 channel. Well all in all the other amp turned out just fine (for my neighbor) but I had to return the other expecting a full refund including the shipping, not with the company I purchased it from, but Amazon wants me to be happy so they are looking in to the situation. I quit using Amazon and the bay for awhile, but my confidence in being satisfied has been somewhat enhanced by my recent purchase."
2,The Ending,As Far as the book it was a page turner with the drama and acts that took place. But the ending was wack if there is another part I would have to get some feed back b4 I buy it
5,Double For My Trouble,"Oh my God, I don't know how this author knew what I have been going through. But I thank God for her ministry. This book made me laugh and cry. I didn't think it could get better, Because her first book ""Ministers With White Collars and Black Secrets"" just blew me away. I don't normally read, but my aunt bought me all 3 of Ms. Smith's books and I thank her everyday. These stories have encouraged me. Keep on writing, Deborah Smith you will touch the lives of millions. I look forward to reading ""Sex Secrets for the married woman"" Thank you Ms. Smith and may God continue to bless you."
4,Stasiland: Stories from Behind the Berlin Wall,"A very well written and researched look at vignettes of individuals--both victims and tormentors--in East Germany during the Cold War. That so many Western journalists--useful idiots--believed the propaganda put out by organizations like the KGB and the Stasi is an indictment of Western gullibility and failure to learn from history. What's worse, Americans are now being led down the socialist path by Comrade Obama, but that's another discussion. Anna Funder is able to develop a deep empathy with her subjects, even the characters who were true believers in the East German police state. What divine justice that those old ideologues were overwhelmed, powerless, and forced to watch as East Germans claimed back their freedom in November 1989 after over 56 years of inhumane, totalitarian rule."
4,Even an old man likes it,"Yes, I admit it: I'm old. And I like this record an awful lot. I listen to a lot of jazz, R&B;, and funk, and shades of those elements drew me to this record on first listen. It's funky, electro-beat-driven euro-pop with ethereal female vocals and it just plain works, even for an old fart like myself.Another plus is that the record is very well recorded and mastered -- it has a huge sound but there is plenty of bass and a tidy mix. Vocal sound is very smooth with some electronic fading and whatnot.The music sounds simple but there is a lot going on in each mix -- occasional dissonance, some crunch, slamming beats, great vocals (throwaway lyrics, but that's to be expected) -- and it makes for a pretty smart funky modern kind of euro-pop record. The shocker is that the first five or six songs are all well written and interesting. After that it's a little repetitive, but that's true of many great records. Highly recommended."
3,"Writing style repetitive, but info is there...","Felt like I had to wade through the same information multiple times to get to the next bit of information. The author seemed to feel it important to repeat herself regarding how difficult it might be to contemplate your own death and how hard it can be to choose the right person to be in charge of your animals after you go.Other than that, the information is there. In the main text most of it is contained in paragraphs you have to scan though to get to the main points and details. I would have liked more tables, bullet lists etc. since I was looking for a reference on ""how to"", but I guess the almost 70 pages of appendices help make up for that."
5,Start here! The Bathstone works!,"Im a single guy in an apartment. My toilet was looking nasty. I tried scrubbing bubbles, mr clean products, bleach, and other chemicals mixed with lots of elbow grease and brushes. Didn't do anything for the nasty ring in my bowl. I got the Bathstone and in two minutes with little elbow grease, the ring was gone and my bowl was like new. Couldnt believe my eyes. Probably spent around $30 on chemical products that didnt do anything. For anyone in the same situation, start here first. This thing is magical!"
2,I WAS DISAPPOINTED,"I am disappointed with this little cleaning stone, having read the reviews and weighed my decision to buy, considering the cost and expectations.The cleaning block dissolves quickly and you must use a LOT of elbow grease to try and achieve the anticipated results.I rubbed. Little change. I rubbed again. Sigh.I will not be purchasing again."
3,A Decent Homage,"While not in the weight class of Footfall, The Legacy of the Aldenata series, or, of course, the original itself, The War of the Worlds: New Millennium is a decent read. The characters are relatable, though their role in the story is pretty obvious from the moment you meet them. The fact that it mimics the original as being written as a memoir removes a significant amount of the tension--the reader knows which characters are going to survive (and which aren't) pretty quickly. Cliff-hanger ending chapters do little to create a sense of tension.Still, despite its faults it's a fun read. The prose is light, but not childish. The modern setting is familiar yet retains the Martian Menace feeling to it. The moral dilemma of To Nuke or Not is well handled.Overall, I recommend it. It's not the first book I'm going to reach for when I need an ""Earth in Peril!!"" story, but it's on the list of alternates."
1,"Couldn't even finish it, it's so bad.","Didn't the author even attempt to verify any of his technical aspects in this book? I didn't even get through the first chapter and I had to stop reading, my brain was hurting so much.There is NO scientific accuracy in the book whatsoever. He talks about the retired astronomer observing Mars through his personal telescope, and seeing Valles Marineris and other things, which have NEVER been seen by ground-based telescopes. And when he talks about ""volcanism"" he has no concept of the scientific principles behind it. Not to mention the errors in earth-hardware (aircraft and the like).Don't bother with this book."
1,Disappointing & count the verdants,"I was hoping for a more well thought out story than what was delivered. What we get is a retelling of those old 1950's put-all-your-trust-in-the-military warhorses. The author certainly knows his military hardware and his geography, but the destination is not worth the trip.Also, it might be fun to count how many times he uses the word ""verdant"" to describe, well, verdancy. Every time a tree pops up, so does the word. At least I had something to distract me from the disappointing story."
1,Judging a tree by its fruit...,"These fierce arguments and counter arguments concerning Pope Pius XII can cloud the core issues. Maybe, instead, we can judge the virtue and effectiveness of this particular shepherd by the actions of his flock.Did Catholic/Protestant trained consciences prevent German citizens from donning Nazi uniforms, then participating in atrocities of the most diabolical kind? Maybe you think Allied 'Christian' soldiers occupied the moral high ground. Yet, remember the deliberate targeting of civilians in the Dresden and Hamburg bombings?Conversely, true Christians are ""no part of this world"", even to the point of being ""hated by the world"". They maintain strict neutrality from the world's many and recurring political and militaristic conflicts. Their shepherd is none other than Christ himself."
2,"good case, but was hindering",good case for carrying my ipod but it was hindering me from walking normal and i had to take it off.
4,Interesting perspective,"This book makes us look at how silly and complex the business world has become and what to do about it. Simple to read, funny, full of comments and valuable lessons to take into battle. Excellent despite a few editting oversights."
3,some new useful material,"Several ideas and examples are drawn from the authors' earlier work on positioning, 22 immutable laws of marketing, and bottom-up marketing. There were a few ideas that are worth chewing on. For example, per Trout, success is often riding the right horse. Both hard work and intelligence are long shots, finding fast-growing successful companies is a long-shot; finding a successful product is a medium shot; finding a person with successful career trajectory and hitching your career to theirs is a more reliable way of duplicating success. Others such as avoiding all recent advances in technology may be a little simple-minded and perhaps, unnecessary in the end."
3,Poorly Edited!!!!!,"Last I checked, Baltimore should be capitalized and I think ""gegan"" must have been intended as ""began"". It only takes 2-3 hours to read the book. You would think that the publisher could find someone to invest that amount of time to proofread the book! Otherwise, some nicely summarized ideas regarding business."
3,Kinda slow but good,Okay so I watched this on Netflix the horror really only starts the last 10 mins and on top of the the effects are kinda bad and the movie woulda been better if it was just the kids messing around. So why 3 stars because it had a really good start then it becam stupid when the bear came in to eat people but was it bad no the effects is what made it bad and I woulda liked it bette if it was just a movie bout why the kids were there it jus kinda worked better
3,Surprisingly good...,"...condsidering that I was suffering from metaphor fatigue by the end of the second page.I suppose it's a matter of taste, but the whole book was ""waxing poetic,"" and I found the style to be a bit tedious. I much prefer a writer who just tells the story and breaks out the occasional metaphor for emphasis. You don't really need one in every single sentence.Otherwise I enjoyed the book."
1,Rough Lesbian Sex,Yay! Lesbian porn on Netflix! It's about time. If only the chicks were a little hotter! I didn't know lesbians were into abuse so much.
3,Slider does not slide freely.,The fan control slide does not slide freely. Very hard to move with one hand and hit the desired speed. I tried ti use some silicne on it and it did not help.
2,Clunky,"Does a fine job of transmitting a nice video signal, but the cable set is annoyingly big and heavy and clumsy. If you connect it to something as light as a DVD player, this thing will try to pull it off the shelf. And if you want to run it through some tight openings in the back of your cabinet, you'll probably have to make the holes bigger."
5,"Not for everyone, but definitely for me","As an Australian living overseas one of the first things that I found attractive about this book was the manner in which Garner paints the suburban Australian landscape and lifestyle. The party scenes made me laugh out loud. I also enjoyed the realistic descriptions of shared houshold life. The troubled relationship which forms the central theme of the book rung true to me with its unresolved tensions, misunderstandings and developments. I very much enjoyed the rhythm and style of the dialogue and descriptions. In fact, I have marked many lines and quotes from my favorite parts so that I can find them to re-read again and again. I can see why other reviewers may have disliked this book for their own reasons. I vote it, however, as one of my favorite books of all time. This is my first review in Amazon, and I just felt drawn to writing something about this book in the hope that maybe some other readers around the world may find as much enjoyment in it as I did!"
4,A true man of understanding.,It's rare to read something so insightful. I won't spoil your journey through this great book by giving you my intire outlook. Well worth the time spent reading this one.
4,Amazing!,I have this product and its amazing!! I love the way my hair feels afterwards. I use it twice a month and its great!
2,"a bit unorthodox, to say the least","I'm not sure what I expected, but it wasn't this. I was hoping to give this book to my brother-in-law, someone with a Catholic upbringing but a Marxist philosophy now- a bit of the reverse of Simone Weil. The theology in this book is so individual, however, as to make me uncertain that it could even be called Christian. In any case, I'm not sure it's a life-path that would inspire any other than a very select group. Because it is different, and because there probably are some people that it might speak to I give it 2 stars, but it wasn't for me."
1,Title is misleading............,"I am a beginner in every sense of the word when it comes to painting and have really struggled with painting trees. So when I did a search for ""How to Paint Trees"" of course this book popped up. I read whatever information was available on the book and thought ""Wow, this is exactly what I'm looking for and need !!"" I could not wait for the book to arrive. Well let me tell you. I was VERY disappointed. To me ""How to"" means I am going to show you HOW TO do something, not ""let's look at a slew of finished paintings and I'll tell you WHY they did it that way !!"" There are hundreds of other books available (the Walter Foster series comes to mind) that are much better. I paid $27.99 for my copy and see that are a few available for less than $10. That stokes the fire just a little more. My advice--- if you're a novice look elsewhere. If you're advanced it is very likely you already know what's in this book. Perhaps middle grounders will find it useful. I surely did not."
3,Totally Wrapped around a Model,"Mary Nacol Meeker is brilliant. She studied with J.P. Guilford and is one of the few to master his Structure of Intellect model of learning and thinking. The model is elaborate and complex, but Dr. Meeker represents in her writings and presentations that it is intuitively obvious. Maybe it is to her. At the lecture in the mid-1970's where I saw her present the model and her application of it, the entire audience took on a deer-in-the-headlights look. The fact of presenting an elegant model, compared to the craft of introducing the initiated to the model, is the difference between proclaiming victory, and helping colleagues to achieve that victory. The whole SOI movement turned into intellectual sophistry, and is a case study in academic narcissism. What a waste of a brilliant mind and a promising career!"
5,A handy supply for work and home,i ordered this because i often need blades at my work and home .The knife i am using is one available in hardware stores branded husky and this product fits with them.I ordered this product because i used stanley knives before and this product was designed to work with those knives.My only complaint is that blades are hard to extract from package.Also it was nice if manufacturer supplied a courtesy blade holder as is shipped with most of multi pack blades.The dispenser can also be displayed or hanged securely.
3,Haven't had to use it???,"You need another option for this. I bought the warranty but haven't had to use it, so I can't really review it."
5,Service Plan for TV's,"An absolute must if you are buying an HDTV...peace of mind and security, when you are spending a fair amount of money on a new high tech TV...Amazon's price is extremely price competitive in the marketplace.Do yourself a favor, and buy an extended warranty...."
2,Key Enabler doesn't meet expectations,Difficult for a senior with arthritis to use; awkward. Not as good as I hoped. It was easy for more able users.
5,My favorite vegetarian cookbook!,"I bought this book only 2 weeks ago and have tried more than a dozen recipes. The recipes are innovative, eclectic, and very easy and delicious. I had recently become a vegetarian and the book has made it fun and exciting. The tofu salad is excellent, so are the roasted winter veggies, the sweet patato pancakes, oatmeal-banana pancakes, the Tilghman Island Stew, valle d'Aosta cabbage soups, etc. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in some new ways of making vegetarian cuisine that are inspired by a variety of ethnic traditions."
5,Great comprehensive cookbook!,I love this Moosewood cookbook too! It is a comprehensive cookbook loaded with ingredient descriptions. The recipes incorporate such a unique blend of ingredients that the finished dish is quite flavorful and nutritious. I also appreciate the footnotes with suggested side dishes. I am not vegetarian and often add a complementary meat product.
4,Delicious vegetarian fare,"I bought this cookbook recently and have already tried about a dozen of the recipes. The strawberry salad dressing was excellent, even made with frozen berries. The Greek lasagna with eggplant and chocolate cherry biscotti also were quite good. I made the asparagus leek strudel for guests, and the entire panful was devoured in no time flat. The recipes that I've tried have been interesting and well-seasoned as written. I have even enjoyed just sitting at the kitchen table, reading this cookbook like it's a novel."
1,NOT vegetarian,"I received this book as a Christmas gift recently, and many of the recipes are very good. However, the blurb on the back misrepresents the recipes as vegetarian. While most are, quite a few contain fish or other sea animals. Their other books, too, claim to be collections of vegetarian recipes. This sort of dishonesty really, really turns me off."
1,i had my copy burned...,"literally, i did. this game wasted my time. i mean, whats the point of entering an event that you dont do anything in. you just sit and watch little animated characters do their little swivels around the bends and such, doing absolutely nothing in the process. you gain no speed on the skiing events, bobled/luge events, or the others. I highly recommend you go and buy something worth buying. you would probably have more fun with a toothpic than with this game."
5,A Heartwarming Book!,"Peter McKay is one of the funniest writers I've ever read. I happen to like humor books, but his columns make me laugh out loud. The book refers to his house as the ""nuthouse"" because he moved his family into a house where the elderly previous owner let in squirrels to feed them in the front hall. no one tells him this, and when he moves in, every time he opens the door, the squirrels line up to rush him and climb over his legs to get in the house.A lot of this book deals with how he attempts to dealw ith all those kids, repair his old house, and keep his sanity. There are a lot of crazy things, though, that the average homeowner or family member will be able to identify with, even if they wouldn't want to admit that these things happen to them!You can tell, though, that even though he makes fun of his family life that they are a very close family and he loves his wife and kids."
1,junk,"Horrible product for professionals! I had an older one of these from the 80's and it was awesome. Roberts redesigned this model over the years and everything about this powerhead is junk. The metal used is so low quality I doubt it will survive a year of work. Even the plastic covers are cheaper. The case was redone as well, for the worse! Waste of space and doesn't allow u to add extra tubes or attachments without buying another case. Autolok tube (u can't buy this set without!) is more work to use than it saves. Completely different stretcher than it used to be and nothing but bad design and cheaper made. Totally disappointed and will have to buy a different brand!"
1,Nothing new!,If you already have the previous edition (WISC-III Prescriptions) don't bother getting this volume. It has almost nothing new and does not devote much space to the new core subtests. The main chapters deal with the core subtests of the WISC-III and the case study at the end is based on the WISC-R!.
1,cut small,You need to order a whole size larger for these shorts to fit. I was very disappointed in the sizing.
1,Not a gel,"I must have received a really OLD package of this stuff, because it is so thick it will hardly come out of the tube, and once you do get it out of the tube, it still retains the shape from the tip and won't spread out or liquify. It reminds me of silicone caulk to use around your bathtub. On second thought, caulk can be shaped and this stuff can't. A waste of almost $10."
2,Did not notice any lasting relief from my dry sinuses,"It kinda balled up and in general not soft and or anywhere close to soothing. I tossed it after a couple uses. I have been using the Grossan Hydro Pulse Tip for 35 years (first order was in 1985 and at the time was the find of my life). In fact, I just bought a new Hydro Pulse today. Only other discover I have made regarding dry sinuses is a product call SinusMend (you can google it for more info). The SinusMend site says the ingredients are organic (also appears to have good reviews in GC-google checkout). The bottom line is it has a very nice smell, uplifting, and also does the job soothing dry sinuses (highly recommended)."
1,Didn't work for me. Gloppy and yucky.,"My allergies in fall are pretty bad and I have to use spray decongestants and pseudoephedrin every day. Problem is, they are very drying and the inside of my nose was cut to pieces. I bought this stuff, having been a user of Grossan's salt mix, but this stuff is just nothing I really would use again. Goes on ok, but ends up becoming this semi-dry glop of goo just balled up inside your nose. Not attractive and really not doing anything to moisturize. I just went back to a bit of A&D Ointment (my family's miracle for everything for over 50 years) on a q-tip and my cuts healed in a few days. Don't waste your money on this unless you like the feeling of fake boogers in your nose. (Sorry - gross, but true.) :-("
3,Good game but...,"First, this game is fun. so many teams ao many modes. ranking acurate and bowls are very fun so is multi-player. But there is a bad part, stats r poorly organized if a db makes a tackle on a 10 yard run then rb gets the stat but not the db who makes the tackle. There is all kinds of little things like that that makes this game 3 stars. But overall the game is super fun when you play it and you probaly wont notice the other problems but anyway this is a good game."
4,"Great book, I couldn't put it down","Throy Shadan is out to destroy the world, again. With his minions it appears that he is almost unstoppable, with only one person to change the tide of the war. That person is Jase Fairimor a simple young man with great talents.This is must read for every fantasy lover. I couldn't put this book down until I had finished it. I heard about this book from many of my good friends who had nothing but praise for it, thus leading me to read it myself. I was not disappointed, it is a great book. With Jase Fairimor as the main character I really had somebody to relate to. A young man who has been gifted with earthpower, driving monsters and humans alike to try and kill Jase. Add on top of that the fact that Jase is the nephew to the king of Kelsa, and you get a story filled with action, adventure, and even some romance."
4,"Well guns dont kill people,rappers do!","Oh yes.Very funny.These guys have everything going against them,they're welsh,they're white and they're piss takers,but they kick serious arse.Before you cast them off as a joke,listen to it for a sec.Yes, they are starnge, but listen to the music.Its hilarious,and they spin a good beat too.A lighthearted change.Recommended."
3,Nascar racing,This game was so dirty and scratched up...the case was broken badly..come on cases are cheap to replace why send your product in something that broken up..I did replace the case for $1.00...the case was very dirty as well..I will not ever use this company again they also sent me an email and ask me to remove my bad review..not a chance I have the right to this so I used it as I felt was right..Stop selling junk and maybe you won't get a bad review..I don't recommend this company as they may comeback and harass you..
5,Best Nascar Game ever,Nascar best game ever. Its is so fun you will play to 3 o clock into the morning.
5,Nicer than expected,Bought this guitar for my teen aged daughter. She loves it. I was impressed with the quality. I didn't expect it to be so nice. Comes with a tuner. We had to watch a YouTube video to figure out how to use that but after that it worked like a charm. Had it all tuned up and ready to play in no time. Now we just have to wait and see if she actually follows through with her desire to learn guitar lol
1,annoyed,"The new guitar don't play correctly becouse the guitar is defective, I bought a defective new intrument !!I thought that all that Amazon sells are in good conditions, I need to retur it and I've to lost time in it."
2,Ok guitar but horrible training manuel,"So I bought this product in hopes that I could learn how to play guitar. I recieved the package and opened it in excitment. The guitar was nice but very out of tune. I then proceed to read the book that teaches you what you need to know....well it is very hard to understand and it really doesnt teach you anything. It was a complete waste of money other then getting a guitar. I am now having to take lessons from someone in person because the book for dummies was not helpful.. Who knows, maybe I am just to dumb for it. I hated this purchase. I would tell anyone to just buy a guitar and get lessons rather then wasting your money on this product in hopes that you will learn to play."
2,Lasted less than 1.5 Years,Neck began bowing badly (and this guitar has been well taken care of). Will cost me $60 to repair so it's not worth it.
3,Good guitar but strings are hard to press for a beginner,"The guitar is pretty good but, as a beginner, I find the cords a bit too hard. Intermediate players also found the cords hard to press so they were lots a buzzes..."
5,A Good Buy,My book was everything the seller said it would be.I got an email the next day saying it was shipped off.Fast service .. good product in excellent condition!I'll definitley buy again whenever my college course requires it.
2,"Good unit, BAD Software","I just got this DVD burner, and the installation was one of the easiest one I have ever made, including the software installation (Nero 7). Everything was OK until I started using the software, first the Nero 7 that came with the unit is a trial version (30 days), Second, anything I try, it brings me to the ""Update (BUY) Screen"", I don't like to be forced to spend money because Nero wants me to do so. I will buy, yes, but another multimedia software. Nero, I think that this trick is backfiring on you! And Sony, I think that you should make sure that the software that you include with your products should be fully functional, no updates required, unless you want to update.I would not recomend this product to anybody, unless it comes with different software"
3,Not bad ... Not Great,"Bugs originally aired several years back on Sci-fi Channel (back when they offered some watchable films ... too bad they lost the formula). Is it great? No. But it is meaningless fun. Bugs has pretty good special effects which helps offset a poorly re-written script (there had to have been a better, more intelligent script than what was offered given theoverall effort of the film). Another Sci-fi movie that is OK to watch,but just Bugs you they didn't go to the extra effort to make better ...it had potential to be better."
4,Seller sent Taipan not Vipyr,"I ordered the Vyper M2 for my previous generation 15"" Macbook Pro. What came in the package today is the Taipan version of the laptop sleeve for Macbook Pros. I ordered the Vyper to match my Booq Vyper briefcase. But, looking at the Taipan, it seems like a perfectly acceptable substitute. And, as far as I can tell, Booq has replaced the Vyper sleeves with the Taipan versions. So, if you really need the Vyper, beware this vendor. But if you will accept the Taipan (as I did), this vendor shipped promptly."
2,Mace PepperGel Spray,"This is advertised as ""Large Personal Defense Spray."" Actually it is not large at all, but is a nice sized one-hand item, and is well designed and easy to use.The spray stream was not as pictured in the ad. The stream was small and did not spray very far. It was closer to a dribble than a long strong stream.Perhaps my item was not fully compressed, as it did not spray far and did not last long -- possibly eight of the weak streams. I fended off a dog a couple of times, but would not trust it to work again if it were needed.My conclusion: This product is over-priced."
5,"seller was fine; haven't had to use the mace, thank God.",I don't like getting e-mails every few days to review a product that I haven't tried yet. Go away.
1,"Leaks, which means I get to buy another one.",I read the amazing reviews and ignored the guy who talked about the product weeping. Now my girls hate to use these and are far less likely to have them ready to go since they are carried around in a baggie in their purse and leak slightly onto their hands when they do hold them.It doesn't matter how good it is: in the trash it makes no difference.
3,The unreliable company called Microsoft!!!,"Well I have gone through a 360 Premium and a 360 Elite in less than a year. I had to take back my Elite tonight after owning it a month as it was having sound popping issues. I worked with tech support for about 2 weeks trying to get it resolved but no luck. The thing was I absolutely loved it when I had it but if it does not work I can see no reason to keep it. So I guess I am just going to sell off my extra controllers, HD Drive, Rapid Charger and other accessories. I am going to see if MS will give me back my money for all my video purchases since I never got to watch them due to the sound popping issues. I think I am just going to get a nice HD DVD drive and wait it out till the next system comes out or when the PS3 gets better games for it."
2,Hard Drive Not Worth the Money,"I made the mistake of buying this version of the Xbox 360 for the 120GB hard drive. I thought I would be able to copy video files to the 360. It turns Microsoft only allows you to copy music and pictures to the 360. If you want video, you have to buy it on Xbox Live, or hack your console.If you're in the market for a 360, save yourself some money. Buy the cheaper version with a 20GB hard drive. On any version you can stream video from your XP or Vista PC as long as you have Windows Media Player 11 installed and configured for sharing across your network.In hindsight, I should have bought a Playstation 3, which allows you to copy video to the hard drive easily. You can also upgrade the PS3 hard drive without voiding the warranty. The 360 hard drive, however, uses a proprietary input."
1,Red Ring of Death within a week.,I bought one from Amazon and got the Red Ring of Death after a week. If you really like playing Xbox only games such as Halo or Gears of War. You should get this thing from Best Buy or Circuit City with EXTENDED WARRANTY. One more thing I want to mention is that you may get some scratches on your game discs. What a crappy game console!
1,"Does not fix the ""Red Ring of Death""","If you are like me then you waited on buying an Xbox 360 because of ""The Red Ring of Death"". I kept hearing stories about how people whould buy an Xbox 360 and a little while later get a critical error that would make their system unuseable. I have also heard that some people had a hard time with Microsoft customer service. So I waited...I finally bought one just two weeks ago. (Made sure it had the falcon chipset) To my dismay My system locked up in the middle of a game and started flashing the ""RRoD"". I was shocked, I was upset, I was angry! I thought after all this time they would have fixed this. I thought the Elite with the falcon chipset was the answer to everyone's problems. Why did this happen to me?!? I was so careful in my waiting. I wanted to make sure this ""RRoD"" was fixed and gone. Why is Microsoft so unreliable on their Xbox 360s?"
1,Unreliable,"When it works, its a great product. But be warned - the red ring of death is still a problem. Buy this product at your own risk. Yes, microsoft will repair the x-box. However, they will no longer send a box (coffin) for your unit. So if you buy an xbox, keep your original packaging for when (not if) the red ring of death hits your unit. They do pay for postage and 1 month of xbox live. Both the Wii and Playstation are much better products in terms of reliability. Microsoft is already losing a lot of money on the repairs. It will be interesting to see if they try to start limiting the warranty period in the future. They claimed at their shareholder meeting the repairs are decreasing. Well, my xbox elite is less than 6 months old and aready needs repairing."
4,Current Xbox 360 owners should wait,"New and improved is the Xbox 360 Elite with a new larger 120Gb Hard Drive and HDMI output. It was recently announced however that coming this fall will be a 65nm version of the 360. The 65nm will make the create use less energy, thus creating less heat and making system quieter.For people that don't presently own 360, it can be rather loud, you'll have to decide if the benefits of use today outway the advantages of having a quieter more efficient Xbox."
3,"God in Heaven, what is next to my tv?!?!","Who put the chipper/shredder behind my tv? And why does it only make noise when I'm playing games? What? That's my 360? That sucks!!If the above imaginary conversation makes no sense to you, I'll say it another way: This thing sounds like a traveling parade of rednecks and illegals is doing road construction in my living room. Unbelievable. My first 360 (the 20G one) was fine, but this thing is insane. Just trash. If you hate hearing your movies you will love the Elite. In fact, buy two, and use one as a noise machine to lull you to sleep at night. Wait for the next iteration, this one blows like yo mamma in high school."
1,Disappointed with this book,I bought this book for instruction on how to fine tune my company's pay-per-click advertising on Google.The book however is primarily about how to make money by placing google ads on your site as opposed to advertising with google.I have not come accross anything profound or helpful in the book so far and i'll probably stop reading it soon and never look at it again.
5,Woeber's Sandwich Pal Cranberry Horseradish Sauce,"I have been using Woeber's Sandwich Pal Cranberry Horseradish Sauce for several year, but I recently found to my dismay that my local grocers no longer carry it. This product is an excellent condiment for almost any sandwich, and has no sodium content (a must for me). I was so happy to find the product offered through Amazon. Just a word of warning: When you try it, start with just a little and build up to your taste. It does, after all, contain horseradish!!!"
5,Perfect Pack,"This backpack is absolutely perfect. My sister used it for her 3 years of college, and after lugging around tons of books and being tossed back and forth, it's still in mint condition. I've even dug it back out to see if it will satisfy my college needs, and as far as I can tell it can take another four years."
1,Someone was too vigorous with a box cutter,"The book is great, except for a 3 inch cut on the front cover, from what appears to be a box cutter. This will seriously affect my ability to sell this book for maximum profit."
3,"The worst of the Reel Fishing series, although better than a lot of other fishing games!","I give this game a typical average rating fishing games of 3 stars. The worst of the Reel Fishing series, although better than a lot of other fishing games!"
3,I liked it... I think,"Not being a museum insider, I haven't a frame of reference to the satire this story represents but still found it an enjoyable enough read. I enjoyed the plot, though I was not terribly fond of the story being told mostly via narration of each character's interior thoughts. The book is short and felt a bit unfinished. There were many story threads, few of which are wrapped up in the end and the main plotline reaches a climax that to me needed some explaining afterward, which is not provided."
5,"Ridiculous, awesome show","You know that show you watched when you were 8 that cracked you up, made your parents roll their eyes, and your friends knew all the good lines? That's Gravity Falls. The kids are weird, the uncle a little disturbing... but it's Disney enough to not be offensive. My 7 1/2 year old son LOVES this show. WAAAYYY better than the nonsense on Nickelodeon."
4,"Great, smart humor","This show is, quite simply, a lot of fun. Another great one for kids and adults. There are some just over the top silly episodes, and some actually heartwarming ones. The reason I dinged it to only 4 stars? Because they are very scattershot, both on TV and digitally, with their episode releases. After just 5-6 episodes, they took a huge, 3 month break and we'd actually forgotten about the show. Then, they did a new episode, and went ""quiet"" again."
5,Cadillac 100 years Of Innovation.,"Cadillac 100 years of Innovation is a Nice good book,Good Hardcover, Good Layout, The only fault is that it repeats itself often, other than that, It has alot of good Pictures, and History."
5,Great costume!,Adorable costume!! Kept my baby nice and warm too! Very durable and comfortable at the same time. I would recommend it highly!
5,"Great phone, great answering machine","I don't know what the other reviewer is talking about, like with any other cordless phone, our caller id came up on the second ring. Maybe it's the phone carrier, and not this phone system. This is a great phone system. We love VTech cordless systems, the multiple handsets, the interchangeable chargers, one base unit, the digital answering machine, you name it, it works great! High quality and well worth the money spent! The batteries last a long time, even over the years."
3,Ok but not cool,"Its an ok knife i have to say its pretty crappy knife also, You have to sand down the part where you put your finger because its pretty sharp and the blade is not as sharp as i heard in the reviews and the black coating on the blade is poorly done, there are bubble spots all over it so im thinking about taking that off also and it doesnt come with the link chain as in the picture its just a string i was really expecting the knife to be like around 5 bucks for how it is and it is also made in china....."
3,Cool???,"Really cheap and sharp, if that's what you want here it is. Looks cool I guess, really a disappointment to me"
3,OK knife.....,"This small knife is sharp out of box.I got 2 from another website for $2 each + shipping.I want to practice for knife trowing with this cheap knife.Good quality and good balance.Handle little bit hard for throwing but good grip for cutting.Easy to sharpening 420 steel is good for the price.I feel too small for my hand (I'm 5'5"" tall) not recommend for big hand.Sheath good secure locking and deploy.Not bad at all If you can find in cheap price."
2,ugh....,"""you get what you pay for"" is usually true but this item i feel like i got ripped off at just a bit over 6 bucks. the metal is cheap and flimsy, and will be good for a one time use knife but i was able to flex it using only my thumbs and index finger with light pressure. the plastic on the handle wasnt even formed properly and had to be cut down with a sharp blade just to fit right. and right out of the package when it arrived i noticed 3 placed on the blade in which there was scratches that the seller or maker tried to hide using a sharpie (note to seller/maker sharpies color in a dark near metalic looking purple which really shows up well on black) blade has a so so sharp edge but felt like it wouldnt last long so i worked on it. i am giving this item 2 stars instead of 1 star for the fact it gave an estimated delivery date of sept 17-oct 2 and showed up sept 14 and the sheath it came in feels like a sturdy sheath."
3,Oh Happy Day!!!,"Well, this is an interesting compilation... make no mistake this CD was NOT a project. This is strictly a Sony compilation from Sony's vault... Actually the Christmas songs on this CD can be had on many other CD's that are currently out there. However, Aretha & Mavis Staple singing ""Oh Happy Day"" together is worth the price of admission!!! That's the gem on this compilation. AFter listening to that, I mailed my church my tithes!!!Also, ""Over the Rainbow"" sounds like a young Patti Labelle singing instead of Aretha. Aretha may be playing the piano, but it's DEFINITELY Patti vocals... Why Patti wasn't credit in the insert is befuddling... Patti, Sony just may owe you a check!!"
4,Cute and bargain price - not so elegant as the picture shows,"this is not the pretty elegant picture the picture leads you to believe - it is not the china looking porcelain with the beautiful silver/platnium looking trim but rather a piece of white everyday porcelain quality with a very thing silver paint line - it is workable and it is a good price bu the picture is quite misleading - if you are looking for something for a more formal table such as a high tea this piece, I am afraid, will disappoint you."
5,So much fun!,"This yodeling CD is great! I now have 5 little yodelers in the house. It teaches great vocal control and is very fun and uplifting. If you want to learn, Kerry is a great teacher and has a clear voice."
5,LOVE FEAST FOR FIAR,"WE JUST USED THIS CURRICULUM FOR MY KINDERGARTNER.....IT WAS A BLESSING TO OUR FAMILY...ANYBODY CAN USE THIS AS A SPRINGBOARD TO TEACHING YOUNG CHILDREN.....BE FLEXIBLE WITH IT: IF YOU WENT TO THE BEACH RECENTLY, USE THE TIDEPOOL BOOK (NIGHT OF THE MOONJELLIES), IF GRANDMA HAS A TRIP TO FRANCE PLANNED, DO MADELINE WHILE SHE IS THERE."
5,What A Tracklisting!,This is what a greatest hits should read like. I like how they split them up into dance and ballad discs too. A perfect treat while we wait for a new album of original tunes...
4,Just like I remember,"My dad used to play, dance and sing to this CD, back when it was a record of course. So as I got a little older, I went and purchased it. it's the same as I remember, I even take it to his house on occasion so that I can watch him charm himself once again with his memories. He still dances and sings to it, (Not to mention the head bob). Lol I still listen to it, and I think it's still one of the best hits that were ever created. I recommend it highly! Especially if you or someone you know, wants to take a walk down memory lane..."
4,"Authentic, yet accessible.","I bought this book while I was in Nepal, knowing that I would miss the food when I come back to the States. It seems that the recipes are for the most part pretty authentic, similar to dished that I had in Nepal (momo's, various dal dishes, various veggie curries, roti). The ingredients are usually available in Indian grocery stores here, andif an ingredient is hard to find, the book provides alternatives.Like other reviewers have noted, this book doesn't have pretty pictures or beautiful cover. So, if you are looking for eye-candy, I don't recommend it. But if you are looking for good, accessible recipes on a rarely-written-about-in-the-English-language cuisine, I recommend this little cookbook!"
3,A bit thin...,"This guide book follows the standard Lonely Planet format of providing not only information about the country, but a wide selection of accommodation and tips for the independent traveller. In my opinion, it does a fair job. The book, however, has to compare to other guide books on the same region. And there are a few very good ones around, e.g. Roger Rosen and the Bradt book on Georgia, which did better. I found the book rather thin. It is full of useful facts, but failed to convey the magic of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. A good guide makes people who do not know the country at all want to go there. This one doesn't. Perhaps it would be better to beef it up a little in the next edition rather than concentrate only on listing towns."
2,worked for 4 months then died,"This product worked for 4 months for me, worked great and I loved it.Then it died and didn't work any more.I wish it had lasted more than 4 months."
5,Pretty easy install!,"Okay, 2000 Ford Taurus LX Flex Fuel. Had NO heat coming out at all and could not get warm air in any settings, everything else seems to work . You pop the glove box door out and let it swing down, unplug the electric, use an 8 mm (I think) socket to get the five screws out (four on the gismo and one on the metal cover just below the gismo), take the old one out, put the new one in, tighten screws, plug electric back in and presto ... heat! Some troubleshooting suggestions claimed that you could hear the door opening, or not, but I could not hear it move even with the new switch in and the thing working. This seems like the most common ""fix"" if you don't have heat and all the fuses, controls, and cooling system (no anti-freeze loss) seem okay."
2,Extended Plan,"We cannot rate this for we have not used it yet and hope we never have to. It is however, costly but needed."
5,very classy,i bought his for myself for my cell phone and im very impresses. its not cheaply made and gives my phone a very classy look
4,Great Customer Service,The company was great. I ordered a size 8 1/2. I got the shoe and it was HUGE! I called the company and they (without questioning) quickly sent me out a size smaller. I would definately do business with again.
5,Great read mixed with names from the past!,"I truly enjoyed this book like the others I have read by Greg Iles. The plot invovles J.Edgar Hoover,Bobby Kennedy,Martin luther King jr. and others in this fictional account of a racial murder in Mississippi in 1968 to present day. The book keeps you riveted,abd you must pay attention to whats going on as there are many characters involved. All in all,I recommend this book. A REAL PAGE TURNER."
4,Iles is a master of the complex plot,"The greatest thing about Iles is his ability to excel in such a wide range of genres and subject matter. No one writing today pulls that off quite as well as he does. Even the greatest authors mess up when they weave too complex of a plot and get to a point where the reader has to suspend disbelief or they create absured coincidences pile up in order to weave the threads together. Iles remains in control throughout every page of the Quiet Games long and very complex plot. Long is the reason I give the novel four stars. I felt it could have been edited down a bit. Twists and turns abound. At one point Iles mentions Ellroy's underrated masterpiece ""American Tabloid"" and I can see why. I was reminded a bit of that novel in the way that J. Edgar Hoover is tied into a Natchez murder, and a lot of memories of Bobby Kennedy are evoked. Excellent read overall, highly recommended."
4,nice experience,"Cool insighful,Ireally like this guy.I enjoy his books there exciting.I really like the wild ,but smart women. The history of the old and new south is very interesting!nice work."
4,Hard to put down but not his best,"Just finished this very exiting book and I am still waiting for Iles' to match ""Black Cross"". I have enjoyed almost all of this authors books (except for Spandeau ) but once again I am still waiting for another book to reach the level of excitment he reached in ""Black Cross"". Perhaps if the characters were a little more developed and not so evil or good."
5,EXCELLENT!,Absolutely loved this book! Greg Iles has an unbelievable talent and imagination! I have been a John Gresham reader and now I have another favorite author! Gripping to the very end!
5,Robert Buderi's Engines of Tomorrow - I loved it!,"This is a serious and important book about past and current practices in managing research at some of the world's biggest corporations. For those looking for the latest schtick in buzz-wordy advice from some management guru about how to compete in the digital age, this is not for you. Things gets a bit repetitive at times, but the profiles of the programs, projects, and people inside top labs is something you'll find in no other book."
2,Sigh,"totally my fault for not reading more reviews than I did, but this was WAY more conservative than the other BGof the B book and was disappointing only for that fact."
2,Not realistic and causes more frustration than anything else,"Of course a game like this is not suppose to be realisitic however the gameplay is absolutely terrible I played it once and got rid of it, but it can be fun. I played with the PC version of a similar a game and I can assure you it is much better."
5,You're a fool not to read this book!!!,"Stan is the Man!!! His analysis of the 4 stages of a chart pattern is 100% accurate. Just check out the weekly charts of any NASDAQ stock and you'll see all 4 stages!!!! As for the book itself...the material can be a little dry because it states the obvious over and over and over again. I guess that's his way of drilling the information into our heads. In any case, this is an Excellent book for any investor."
4,The first few steps,"Fully explains charts, MA, RSI, Volume, overhead resistance, Stage analysis. When to and where to place Sell-stop orders, Buy-stop orders limits and GTC....etc. I liked his writing style, very easy to read and understand. This book doesnt cover MACD, Triangular breakout and the rest of 100 other things. You cant fit all that in 1 book. so he only cover the most important thing menthioned above."
4,fun game back in the day,this game was fun but it was way to easy to score on it you could score at the tap of a button with anybody it had Wayne Gretzky though in this game so that was cool
1,"a series of multiple choice questions, unrelated to the SAT Italian exam","This shoddy book contains a series of multiple choice questions, unrelated to the SAT Italian exam, without any explanations of answers or subject review whatsoever."
3,Returned It,I originally bought this because I needed a flashlight with a spring clip.I didn't notice it was xenon.It is too hard to turn on/off.There is no on/off button so you have to turn the cap which is hard to turn and requires several rotations plus an additional turn to prevent accidental activation per the manual. Ridiculous. I did it once and was already sick of it.Plus ... it's xenon ... dead technology blown away by LED ... xenon should be off the market by now.
1,Let down,this booked was so hyped up to be the ultimate for horror/occult fans. I must have missed the point. Not worth the price of admission.
3,useful,"I like this camera case, it has room for my camera and my cell phone if I want to go out taking pictures and don't want to bring anything else. I really like the clip that is attached to the case, it easily clips onto my jeans so I don't have to carry it around with me."
3,Good for the money,"Was a gift for my daughter, and she love it, but don't use it as much as she should when she takes her camera out"
1,crappy shipping,"i ordered this game about 4 weeks ago and still haven't gotten it yet. i paid for it and everything bc my bank statement came and it was on there, but i still haven't gotten it in the mail. so i think it definitely sucks A hole!"
5,Definitely QUICK dry!!,"I did a 3 coat mani including glitter at 10:30 at night. Ordinarily, I'd wake up and the polish would be smudged. I used the fast freeze quick dry and was able to do my nails and go right to bed. Love this stuff! I always make sure I have a bottle on hand from now on."
3,"Lyrical, meandering story that never quite arrives","People are probably going to hate me for this, but here goes. I decided to read ""Engine Summer"" because Gene Wolfe's ""Book of the New Sun"" is my favorite series and some of the reviews I read made me think this book might be similar. There are some similarities, of course, but this book does not have the hard edge, action, and plot for which I was looking. Frankly, I found it a little boring. I then reluctantly tried Jack Vance's ""Tales of the Dying Earth"" and found exactly what I wanted. I've heard it said that there are no female fans of Vance's work; I suspect there are many more of ""Engine Summer"". Yes, that's a sexist statement. Perhaps I should say it another way: ""Engine Summer"" is the glass half full, while ""Dying Earth"" is the glass mostly empty, which I personally find a lot more interesting."
2,CD runs under windows - unacceptable,"All I can say is, yeah the book is okay, but the included CD runs under *windows*. How ridiculous is that? Have these folks heard of using linux as one's primary, desktop OS for everything? How can you possibly publish a study guide for a linux cert with software that doesn't run on linux? Crazy"
2,Not for me,"The book is wonderful. However, who on earth eats like that? No one I know or have heard of. It's impractical. The kind that will just sit on your bookshelf and you'll dust it off once in awhile."
3,A fairly average book,"The book is a failry reasonable resource and helped me prepare for the 70-175 MCSD exam. However, it is full of errors that could affect your understanding of the subject matter.Also, it was put together by several contributing authors some of whom are apparently not familiar with correct English language structure. This sometimes makes their material difficult to follow and I was fortunate that I already knew most of the stuff that they were talking about."
4,Great intro to some great music...,"I first heard ""killing moon"" in the movie ""Donnie Darko"" and I investigated a bit and found it and many other great tracks, by a precursor to bands like the flaming lips... Some songs remind me of coldplay. (I mean no insult, i'm a Canadian teenager who knows no better.) Anyway... good compilation to get you hooked before digging deeper. Get it and enjoy..."
4,Lulu is superb at silly talk,Lulu is a pip! When words start cascading willy nilly out of her- its infectious. Kids will love it's sillyness and learn a lot about the latitude of English- as a fun language. The finale was a little crowded on the page- but I gave my storytime kids phrases and we said them all together adding to the hubbub!
5,Quality,"The Rams outfit was made out of good thick material, the seams were tight, no loose threads and the embroidery was perfect. Very high quality. The NFL would be proud!"
5,great band,"Snoop Dogg For president is a great song and alot of fun to listen to, especially if you really listen to the words and play it all out in your mind!!However!!! They have a new song on I-tunes called We're Irish and We're Rockin' that leaves Snoop Dogg in the dust!!!! (and that is hard to do!!) #1 for the Irish or anyone who wants to pretend to be!!! (all those on Paddy's Day!!!)Crayanddempsey.com will give you all the details....."
3,Salsa anyone?,"This video is one worth purchasing. The multiple angles are fantastic. For those not familiar with salsa, it is not intended for absolute beginners. There are not explanations that beginners need to know. However, for those who have at least a little experience, it is excellent!"
4,Great if you have some idea about leading/following,"The DVDs make a great job showing the steps, you can learn lots of patterns but they don't bother to show how to lead/follow or the correct positioning of the hands. They don't talk about frame or anything similar so if you don't have a basic idea on how to lead or follow I suggest you try to find some advise outside these DVDs on that particular subject.Otherwise, great, easy to follow and learn, lots of movements that are built on previous taught movements, so it is easier to learn."
2,Maybe I'm just too cynical...,"My son picked up this book and loves it. The graphics are good, and it's... kinda Lego, but it is really poorly written. Maybe I don't have the background to appreciate this book (or I'm too old and cynical), but I find it funny that the ""lost"" kingdom is found soon after they go on the quest. Hmmm... bad title? Too many characters for such a short book - I was confused which knight was which - maybe I couldn't memorize their colors. Either way, my son likes it, but I think just calling it ""kid lit"" is too easy a cop-out for anyone to purchase this book."
2,do not like the chewable tablets- hard to see it on the package,"Seem like this product is not the same as from Walmart or target. Do not like the chewable tablets, not working too well for me."
2,Not worth the price,"This was the best Aurora Costume I could find online, but it was not worth the money I paid."
4,Good for short trips,"I like the overall look of this travel diaper bag. It's only great for short trips or doctor's visits because it doesn't hold that many diapers. But it's easy to travel with, especially when you are already holding a million things in your hands, arms and maybe legs too!Warning: the red baby wipe travel case that came with the product dyed my baby wipes red! I have no idea why, but good thing I have so many of those wipe travel cases I just replaced it with another one. Problem solved."
2,Alot of moolah to change a diaper,"This changing kit is way overpriced an dysfunctional. I purchased this product as an accessory to my skip hop duo diaper bag, but I returned it right away. Basically, it's a diaper changing pad with a wee bit of storage space. It's only big enough to hold diapers, wipes, and maybe some ointment. If you need to carry an extra outfit or a few toys, this is NOT the product for you. The first thing that came to my mind when I opened the entire thing was that it's too big for the diaper changing stations in most public restrooms. The other disadvantage is that you have to carry it on your wrist or in your hand. I'm not sure how they expect parents to navigate their children through a parking lot or store while holding on to more than one child and this diaper changer kit. It is well made and has a cool looking pattern, but not worth the money."
3,Plubisher's refusal to release the answers to the end of chapter questions,"This is an excellent workbook with questions at the end of each chapter. Imagine my surprise when the book has no answers to the questions so you can check your work! I then search on line, call the publisher and am told that they don't release the answers to anyone who isn't teaching the course. I am helping a young gentleman study for his master plumbing exam, and am a University of Vermont Asst Prof, but unfortunatly that doesn't count. Very Frustrating!"
3,You may want to spend a tad more.,"My wife and I bought this coffee maker about 4 years ago. We still have it and use it (and the programmable timer, which we love) nearly every day. I will say this; after about 2 years, the coffee container developed a leak. We contacted the company via email and was told they'd be glad to sell us a new one (for about what the original coffee make cost us). We did a little looking around and bought one for less than what the manufacturer wanted to sell it to us for. Now, the new container is working fine. Will our container start leaking again? Who knows, but if I were advising someone on a coffee maker purchase, I'd say, spend a bit more than we did."
5,My Favorite video,I love this pregnancy workout. It is intense enough for me to break a sweat and short enough to do on the week days after work. It is easy to learn the moves. It has variety and funs moves.
3,The steps are too complicated,"This is my third pregnancy and I bought this video in an attempt to combat those dreaded pregnancy pounds!I was very excited and couldn't wait to start. Everything started out well and I was just getting into the groove when Madeleine broke out the complicated steps. I tried my hardest to follow her, but she just went too fast for me.She tries to break down each mini-routine into several steps, but she only shows you once and then expects you to graps it right away. Then as soon as you are just beginning to get it, she moves on to the next mini-routine.This is a nice video, but not for someone who is uncoordinated (aren't we all when we're pregnant?) or who hasn't had much experience in an aerobics class. I am now looking for something more repetitive!"
2,"Love the Backstreet Boy, Hate this DVD","I was hoping for some concert footage but I was dissapointed. This DVD is more of a documentary than anything else. It's not worth watching more than once or twice. The up side of this DVD is that you get to hear them sing ""Shape of My Heart"" a few times.I want live concert footage, not clips and videos. I hope that they do better next time or I'll just save my money."
5,backstreet boys around the world,the video was the best they ever did in a couple of years thank you boys for making a great video
1,Documentary only - no music,"I bought the video thinking that it was the same thing that was on TV a couple of months back - concert from the Staples Center with clips from their trip around the world. One of the other reviews seemed to confirm that belief. I was wrong. This is a documentary only. If you're looking for music, don't get this video because you won't find any here."
2,Not so Bad for ...,"I have rented and played this game and it is trying to copy HydroThunder and is not doing a good job at it. The graphics might get 2 1/2 stars. The Good Things: Available at ... The Bad Things: Bad graphics/horrible boat selection and handling/ and VERY narrow courses that make playing difficult. All in all, if you are gonna pay ... for a video game, dont bother with this one."
1,***WARNING***WARNING***WARNING***WARNING***,"Buy this book at your peril! I just finished reading it from cover-to-cover and was cursing at every error I came across. Some of the errors are damn dangerous too - not only for exam purposes but also on the job. This book has a ""hurriedly written"" sense: chapters overlap considerably making you wonder if the squillions of authors who worked on it collaborated in any way and there are many grammatical errors and scary technical errors. This is the last non-Cisco Press book I ever buy for study purposes. It's interesting to note that the equivalent Cisco Press book is only half the size of this door-stopper. I'm so angry I'm going to ask Syngress for my money back. You have been warned."
1,awful-it is not maroon but purple!!!,"I recently purchased this same tie from the WB harry poter store . I actually got the chenille scarf and tie set which is about 43.00, anyways it is this same tie and it was dark purple NOT Maroon at all. I suggest you buy your tie from Wild Ties their tie is exactly the right color, less expensive and also better quality."
4,good,"the owner approves of these crocs, after giving them as a gift, I can report that they are comfortable and reasonable."
5,Exactly as expected,Third pair of Croc shoes and still love them. Sized as expected and the black color is dark as expected. Still comfortable and price was good. Put it altogether with quick delivery - great
3,hard one.,"If you are an advance bass player and you like serious stuff, you can start learning some tunes of one of the most important bass man on earth, Paul McCartney. But if you are a beginner and you are practicing the bass, be carefull. The bass lines in some of the beatles tunes are really very though to learn and follow. The book in fact is like any other book with the same chords for guitar and sheet music for piano. I recommend if you like good music, to practice and learn from Pink floyd's album The Wall (easy to follow). But returning to this book, is good if you are advance. Not good for beginners."
3,"BEWARE - does NOT fit 5.4L V8 - ""Does It Fit"" tool is wrong!","I just purchased this item and went to install it in my 2007 Ford F-150 SuperCrew XLT with a 5.4L V8, and it is the wrong filter. The correct one is a flat rectangular filter, which I didn't know because I had never serviced this pickup myself before.I found this filter by searching for ""2007 F-150 air filter"". I then used the Amazon ""Does It Fit"" tool and it said it fit. When I got the filter and discovered it didn't, I tried the tool again and it still says it fits.No big deal, I am returning the filter and should get a full refund and am ordering the correct one."
5,Offers the insights of a modern hermit who's lived most of his life along the Mississippi,"This new collection of 'rat tales' by a confirmed Last River Rat offers the insights of a modern hermit who's lived most of his life along the Mississippi. Like Huck Finn, Kenny Salwey has a host of adventures to recount: he's a hunter, trapper and woodsman alike and he is also a fine storyteller and even an expert on environmental issues - so his essay and story collection is packed with experience and insights.Diane C. Donovan, EditorCalifornia Bookwatch"
3,Retired exam,"I've been waiting for this book for 6 months. Just as this book was published, Microsoft retired this exam and completely changed MCSD requirements. The new requirements for the MCSD seem less at the nuts and bolts Windows level and more at the system analyst level. Interesting because, for the first time, salary surveys in the computer professions show that code crankers are earning more than analysts. Microsoft moves in mysterious and frustrating ways. My sympathies to the authors of this book."
4,Get you through the exam,This is a good book for the exam and general information. It was not stuffy and it presented the information for the course in a clear and concise format. Read it if you want to pass the exam and learn some really good stuff too. I passed the first time reading from cover to cover.
5,Good for beginners,"I got this book for the first at a local public library in Dec 1999, and I keep lending it when I want to refresh.It is a good book for beginners.The part about how to use MoneyCentral's Investment Finder is great for who can't develop their own worksheets in Excel.The book also list web resources, maybe by now it is a bit old but still ok.I would like to see a 2001 edition of this book, with the addition of a chapter teaching how to develop yourself in Excel or with different software choices.Buy this book if you want a smooth introduction to investing and detailed explanation of what all those P/E, ROI, ...mean."
1,Recipe for Doom,"This author has great 20/20 vision of the past with financial models and trading strategies that are well scripted for modern investing. The book handles multiple issues and will definitely increase your confidence in on-line trading. Which is why the book is totally flawed and spells doom for the majority of online investors, because their confidence will blind them to their continuous losses inherent in the practice of online investing."
1,I got crazy!,"Since I received this, it has never worked.I want to konw how to return it!But I think the return shipping fee can buy another timer..."
5,Works great,"I used this laying vinyl tile in our kitchen, hall and bathroom. It seems to be durable and was easier for me to use than a J roller. I was even able to roll under the toe kick area of the cupboards."
4,Love it! except...,I really like every thing about this but I didn't know I'd be using the strap that came with it. I'll need it because it's not very loud at all. It beeps for a long time which is great unless you can't hear it in an different room. Otherwise it's great! I'll just put around my neck(it's small)if I'm going to be out of the kitchen.It very small(good thing)and operates on only one button battery so it couldn't be much louder without draining the battery. I'd buy it again for sure.
4,Good timer for a variety of purposes,"I own the Polder Electronic timer, and it has several nice features which makes it very practical for a variety of purposes. I used it to time my prints in a photographic darkroom. I must caution that the LCD display will not function if the timer gets wet."
2,Magnetic does not work,"If you plan to use the magnetic, dont buy this. It does not stay in horizontal place, only vertical (the object is to heavy and the magnetic is installed only on the right side!)."
5,PERFECT!,"EASY TO USE AND YES, WHEN YOU'RE SETTING IT, IT BEEPS WHEN PRESSING KEYS, BUT I LIKE THAT.IT TELLS ME IT HAS ACKNOWLAGED YOUR ENTRIES.MORE COMPACT THAN IT LOOKS.PROMPT DELIVERY.OVERALL GREAT PRODUCT."
3,It's ok.,"Some of the buttons won't work unless you press on them hard. Either that, or i am doing something wrong. Also, every time you press a button, it beeps loud as heck. I got it for class to jot down the minutes into lecture at which i am writing down notes. Only on key points, of course. This makes it easy to go over the material from which i recorded with another device. Nevertheless, it's easy to take the loud beep off. Simply, remove the screws on the back and either, cut the wires, or un-solder it. It's up to you. From a scale of 1 to 10, i give it a 6. Simply, because some of the buttons need to be pushed hard."
1,"This timer needs a ""mute"" button!","This product is good for what it does but it was not at all helpful for my purposes. I purchased it to time speeches/talks of colleagues. I quickly found that any button you press on the timer beeps so loud that it is very disruptive, distracting, and nerve-racking to the speaker and audience listeners. It would be very helpful if the timer had an optional ""mute"" button, but for only [a little], what could I expect? So overall, I would say the timer is OK for jogging, cooking, or other activities where noise is not a factor but DON'T dare use it in your local library or church! Hope this is helpful for future buyers."
3,"Ok product, but test it in a commercial kitchen",This product has many good things going for it. The alarm can be heard over the hoods and the chatter of my cooks as they call out orders. It is fairly rugged. It has been dropped many times and still works fine. It also is easy to clean. It does have issues though. It needs a sliding cover to protect the buttons so that they do not get bumped. It needs to move the magnet so that it stays level. I also would like to have the magnet removable.
5,The Perfect Polder Clock/Timer,"Polder 898-95 Clock, Timer and Stopwatch, BlackThis is a wonderful product. I am elderly, have diabetes, and have short-term memory loss! This little timer with its lanard allows me to carry it like a neckless reminding me to shut the sprinkers off, take my TV dinner out of the oven, and take the endless two-hour blood sugar tests. I would truly be lost without it. It takes only a touch of the button to reset the same time interval! I used to carry around an alarm clock only to leave it on the table when I moved about the house and thereby missthe alarm and my blood test. I used to turn the clock hands to reset the alarm and wind the clock and alarms. All of this was hard with my numb fingers. I love my new Polder Clock, Timer. I wish all diabetics had one.Barb"
3,OK product,"Pros: small size / white color (not black) / able to hang around anywhere even neck / handy as timer & also clock.Cons: cannot see time/timer/stopwatch in the dark (most bothersome) / must read instructions to operate (cannot guess) / you will need round battery later on (not solar operated) / may be a bit high in price for the ""cons""?"
5,Best timer,"Works very well, intuitive to use and the fact that you can carry around the house around your neck makes it much more effective. I own three of them"
5,"As a Mom, I couldn't live without this timer!",This timer is fantastic. I love that I can wear it around my neck and go about my business. It was fantastic for when I was nursing my daughter if I had something on timer I could at least turn the timer off without having to get up and disrupt her mealtime. It's excellent for timing time out for my kids too. We actually have 2 of them in our household. My husband kept running off with mine so I purchased another! Love it!
4,Easy to use.,This timer/stop watch is very easy to use. The only thing I would change would be a volume switch as it beeps very loudly for every button that you hit. Other than that it works very well.
4,Not quite what I was hoping.,"Lets start with the positive: 3 features; Clock, ""Count-Up"" and Timer. It also includes a magnet on the back and a strap. The battery is easily replaced and doesn't require a screwdriver or anything like that. The timer has an auto-memory feature so that when it completes, it returns right back to the time you set it at. This is ideal for me as I bought it to have recurring 2 minute intervals for use while working out.Now on to the negatives: Each button push releases a loud beep, and it's annoying. The ""count-up"" feature is the stopwatch whose smallest unit is a second (no 10th or hundredth of a second). The magnet is weak and can barely keep itself righted. There is no way to turn off the auto-memory timer.So, nice positives and fairly insignificant negatives make me very pleased with this device. I, however, already own a fully accurate stopwatch, so the lack of tenths and hundredths in the ""count-up"" feature is not a big deal for me."
3,Beeps very loudly with each button press,"Easy enough to use, and the around-the-neck use is nice, but it beeps SO loudly every time you press a button...Also, as others have noted, it is not intuitive to enter time using the number buttons as they are arranged & labeled.I really never end up using it for these reasons."
2,Not all it's quacked uo to be,"I bought this book because it was the only FrameMaker 6 book on the market at the time.The back of the book reads ""The fastest, easist, most comphrehensive way to master Adobe FrameMaker 6.0""You will not master FrameMaker using this book. You will learn the basics, that is all.I am disenchanted with this book and FrameMaker 6.0"
5,Another Great album most people don't have,"I remember buying this album when it first came out. Quirky, strange, weird. But... Some of the most original music ever. Fun definately not PC lyrics. I have missed this great studio album since someone broke my yamaha turntable years ago. I have the live cd's but nothing can match the magic of this first studio work. Luckily, it is occasionally available here at amazon, so old fans can enjoy and new fans can be made."
2,Very superficial book about business rules,"Parts of this book seem to me superficial. It explains only very basic concepts about business rules and it does not go into detail how you can manage and implement these rules in a company. The book has only 99 pages whereby 30% of the book are cartoons and pictures. Therefore, I think that the book is totally overpriced and doesn't deliver enough knowledge how to apply business rules in a real-world situation."
5,Very Pleased,"Excellent reference for anyone wanting to make their own herbal medicines. Good information on dosages, recipes, and procedures. Also, includes good information on precautions to ensure safe usage. Easy to read and follow. Highly recommended!"
5,I just love Matthew Wood,Anyone interested in herbs will be glad to have this book in their library. Matthew Wood shares so much history and lore as well as his personal clinical experience.
5,Most durable feather toy you'll get,"I have a 4 and a half month-old kitten and these are his favorite toys, hands down. The fuzzy outside is thick enough for a cat to sink their teeth into, and the plastic ball inside contains a bell, which is actually quite loud. The plastic doesn't hold up to being stepped on, though, so I try to remember to pick them up after kitten is all played out. The real selling point, though, is the ""feather."" It's not one of those fake ones you get from an arts and crafts store. The feather ""fibers"" are attached to a thick string, rather than a plastic shaft, which makes it much harder to snap and pull out. And even after the feathers are gone, there's still the string left!"
1,Left in the dark,I AM BOOKLESS B/C OF THIS SELLER. I had to barrow the text book for my Cal. III class from my teacher because I never got my own book. I e-mailed the seller and he said that he sent it and would check in on it. I have been trying to get a hold of him after his e-mail and have not been able to. If he was tring to make good with me I did not know about. I do not know if anything is happening.
3,"It doesn't matter what people think, if you need to buy it...","If your instructor assigns the class this textbook, then you have to get it.It doesn't matter what people think about it, you just have to get it.I just searched around and found a torrent. Paid zero. I would recommend that to everyone else, also, search for the solutions manual with evens and odds."
1,Nice Pictures,"I have used two calculus books in my lifetime so far. This one was the second and I just ended up confused. I recomend you find some other textbook. The pictures are nice, but I don't think that the book is well written and easy to follow."
1,Why the wait?,"Now I did watch season 6 on netflix, but I want the dvd to complete my collection of the show. Yes this was the weakest season to date but why make us wait, its not like there is a wait for the new season. This dvd is out in Germany..thats not even the country of origin. How can they get first dibs on the dvd..months...maybe even years before we do."
5,Instant Team Building,"Great book, has some really good team building strategies. simple but effective. Also some great ideas on 'Getting the beliefs right."
5,If you know how to do mosaic puzzles this is a good one,My brother and I were able to get this puzzle done in a combined 12 hours (6 hours each). There are a lot of different colors in this which makes it easier. Overall it was a fun puzzle to make.
1,Jams,"There is no reason to use a brad nailer that jams as frequent as this nailer. I've had it for a little more than a year, used it or tried to use it 10-20 times and it's jammed on me so much that I use my dewalt 16-gauge finishing nailer in place of it. And now I'm about to buy another 18 gauge.I will never buy another Hitachi pneumatic product again. This is junk and not worth anyone's time to deal with it, not even for a single use application. What good is it if it always jams and you spend more time clearing the jam than nailing!"
5,Great Tool,"Hitachi NT50AE2 18 Gauge 3/4-Inch to 2-Inch Brad NailerWe needed to replace the base board, door, and window trim at our farm house. I gave my wife about five minutes of OJT(on the job training) and have yet to get to use the gun myself. Worked great out of the nice included tool case. Great for light trim work."
5,Excellent tool,"I have been using this tool for over a month in installing 4"" baseboard. All I have to say is that this nailer is light in weight, very easy to use. Has not miss a shot yet. come with its own case and protective glasses. I'm very satisfied with purchasing this tool. I bought it at Amazon.com, free shipping and was delivered three days after ordering."
5,Good nailer,"I used this to do a board and batten project so far with a small compressor. It worked really well, no jamming. I used oil each time, so far it worked like a charm"
4,Functional and reliable,"I've had this particular brad nailer for a little over a year now and it has served me well. Although I've never tested the upper range of its capacity I've never had a problem with it. Doesn't seem to double shoot, misfire, jam, or over shoot. I got it in a package deal with a compressor and finish gun. If you can get it at a decent price I'd say its a worthy mid range gun."
3,"A little disappointed, especially for the WIN user","I've now completed the entire ""Classroom in a Book"" and found it overall quite helpful overcoming the ""new software"" fears.With the massive installed base of WIN versus MAC, it is surprising that so many of the critical screen shots are MAC only. They do offer many in Windows, but when one is starting out, every cue helps. It should be redone for Windows.Also, the practice files on the included are locked ""Read Only"" -- which is a small problem, one must first ""unlock"" them in Explorer to save them as directed.Missing: The main purpose of software is to help one do a ""job"" -- in this case, build web sites. It would be very helpful if they included a chapter, ""Building a Multi-Page Site from Scratch"" -- taking you step-by-step through a good system of building sites using the software. Advanced users and Web Masters aren't reading the book anyway!"
5,This group is AMAZING!!!,"I saw Enter the Haggis on TV just recently, on the ""Live"" with Regis and Kelly show, and I couldn't believe how great they were!! I was completely blown away!! I am the kind of person who appreciates most kinds of music, but this group was so good, I had to rush right out to get their CD! ""Casualties of Retail"" is just one of their great albumns! A combination of Rock, Country and Celtic flavor, in my unprofessional opinion, makes them a curiosity, but when you actually hear them...WOW! I went online the next day and purchased not only one, but two of their CD's! Their instrumental pieces are out of this world, and their sound is just AWESOME! A must have for people of all ages! I am in my late 30's and can still appreciate the talent that these gentlemen have, you've got to listen to understand!!"
1,Useless,"No value here. FM transmission is spotty, even in cars with great antennas (Honda/Acura/Toyota). Stay away."
3,The only good part of the Tom Tom,"I ordered it from Amazon and it was sent on time. I did use it for a couple of days and it works well. It stayed on the windshield and the sound was good.The tom tom I bought it for had problems and I returned it. So, I didn't need the fm mount either and returned it to Amazon. I recieved a refund but because it wasn't Amazon's fault, they charged me for the shipping cost both ways.I would never again buy anything off the internet if there is any chance that I may have to return it. Once they have your money, your at their mercy."
4,"Works great, but cost too much","I had lost my mount on a business trip and had to buy another one. I did not need the FM transmitter, but this was the only way to buy a replacement. I called TomTom and they could not help. I am not happy with TomTom due to this. It is ridiculous that they do not have replacement parts."
1,avoid this or repairmaster warranty,"the cost of the warranty is 1/4 the price of a new laptop. It took 7 months to get service through a similar group, warrantech and repairmaster, and they only wanted to service it after we had reinstalled the operating system. For a laptop which had problems with a faulty fan they wanted an operating system reinstall!"
5,"Great, and auto on a dusk is a dream.","I love the ""turn on at dusk"" feature of this switch. I have landscape lights that were on a timer that constantly needed to be adjusted as the days grow longer and shorter. Now I just program the switch to come on at sundown and it does the magic for me. It was easy to install, easy to program and it just plain works as advertised."
4,"Works Well, but Watch out for Blown Bulbs!","I ordered this so that we did not have to worry about turning our front door outside light off and on (we have an American Flag out front). It has worked well for us thus far. We did have one issue where I thought the switch has broken all of a sudden, but it turned out that it was the bulb that had blown. When the bulb blows, the switch will not have the minimum load it needs to run (the switch will appear blank as if it had fried out or something). Simply replacing the bulb fixed the issue and I am happy to report that none of the settings were lost! My only complaint is the minimum load requirement. We used to use a CFL bulb in this light socket, but had to convert back to the old-school energy-inefficent bulbs to enable us to use this timer. That said, I would still recommend getting this and am looking at getting a few more for a couple more lights."
3,Not for civilians,"I purchased this book to educate myself on threats to networks. Although I have a strong computing background (degree in computational chemistry, 20+ years application programming), my network weakness made this book virtually incomprehensible.It is laid out much like a dictionary where an attack is listed along with its popularity, simplicity, impact and risk rating. What usually follows is a very technical discussion of the attack and possible counter measures.I suspect that this book would be a great use to network and system administrators, but I also suspect few others will get much out of it."
2,No chemistry,Really there didn't seem to be any chemistry between Colin and Mia. His total disregard for her was pretty bad too. The way she could feel every time he was with another . . . so BAD! Of course the author didn't really explore those feelings though. There seemed to be a lot of action but the only character that I wanted to see more of was Laurent and I actually wanted to see him with Mia!
4,"Good, but the first was better","This is the third book in the series, and, having read all three, I enjoyed the first one a bit better. While this was a good book, I didn't like the hero -Colin - as much as the other two. He's a bit of a snob which gets annoying.The story itself was pretty good, lots of action and almost enough romance.All in all, a good book but not the best of the series."
4,Momentum,"This outing the the Elastic Band lacks the stretch I was hoping for the band. Overall the tunes are put together well, but they have the preditable feel of R&B solos. I didn't hear any ""real"" progression with this band moving into unchartered territory. This would be a good CD to introduce your R&B friends into Jazz."
3,Pandemonium,This is a game you need to enter the cheat codes to play. My son loves play through the levels with the unlimited lives. He can't get very far into the game otherwise.
5,Beautiful Recording,"I am a music teacher and clarinetist. I have performed the concerto featured on the CD and purchased this recording for my fourteen-year-old nephew, who is now playing clarinet, guitar, you name it. My nephew told me he has listened to this CD over and over, and that he enjoys it. Mr. Stolzman, the featured clarinetist, performs beautifully. I highly recommend this recording."
3,electronic copy book is handy at work but not handy to carry around,I wish I have a copy I can read on the road.
1,A disappointment,"I bought this to use to teach my 7yr old son. Forget my son year old, I cannot see the writings on the model. It was so shabbily done and the instructions are non-existent. The booklet has the bones but has it in a very random order. The muscle names and ligaments are given in the book. But I would rather they did a good job listing the bones.0 value for money spent!!"
4,Good overall value,"Considering the price, this is a great buy for studying the human skeleton. Some of the numbering is a little sloppy and the number key that comes with it looks like the english was translated from another language. As a result, some stuff gets lost in translation. But, if what you want is a fairly good representation of the human skeleton for not very much money this is a good option."
2,Not worth the money,"I was excited to get this in hopes that it would help me in my A&P class, but the numbering is not only small, it is also smeared and flat out unreadable in many places. Probably not going to be able to use it much as I cannot read what half of the numbers are to match them to the key provided. Disappointed."
3,It serves the purpose,"I would have liked to see more land marks on the scapula and humerus, anyway it is good an helpful for a skeleton this size"
5,Highly recommended for all students,"Recommended for students preparing to take the PSAT, as well. Is among the best of all the standardized test prep books I've used in my four years as a private tutor. Excellent!"
2,misleading practice,"The product itself works great. Very happy there.I was however unhappy with the unnecessarily high shipping and ""handling"" charges.The product costs enough with without last minute trickery.Secondly, as another reviewer mentioned, only one rag was microfiber.Upon reviewing the ad it actually does not state you will receive 3 microfiber rags but rather 3 cleaning rags.The pictures however CLEARLY show like cloths.Again I find this unsatisfactory, misleading and not up to my standards of fair practices.The product sure is good though."
3,good backup part,"If you use HP printers of a certain mark as many small offices do, the LaserJet 1100 series, you may want to pick up one of these cables. The series is kind of dated but if you have them they are handy and perhaps worth more trouble to replace than keep using. This cable however is a part that can malfunction and may need replacing. Its not very well stocked in electronics stores so I had to come on Amazon to pick one up."
4,Awesome book for beginers,"This book is for people who are beginners in Linux...but want to get into Linux System Administration...This book does a GREAT job into going into the basics on how to get a Linux Server up and running. Has some AWESOME configuration examples that actually get you up and running!I, to this day, still use the DNS configuration examples to set up DNS servers at my job today!Great book for beginners who want to be power users...-C"
2,Linux Administration,"I am not usually so cynical, but I know that I wish someone had written this review before I bought this book.It is not a horrible book, it has some good info in it, however, if you run into errors in compiling your kernel, altering scripts or configuring samba -- you are going to be in trouble. He walks you through a cursory, idyllic example in each section, but seldom more than one, and has very little on trouble-shooting. Some of the info is even incorrect -- which drove me nuts! (small omissions or typos unix gurus would easily catch, but if you know unix, you don't really need this book!)He probably would have done better to narrow the scope of the book, and go a little deeper rather than being so broad and shallow. He tries to cover too much too quickly.If you want a general overview of what a linux box can do, this book will fit the bill. However, if you want one solid tutorial or one solid reference, this is not the book."
2,"It's all too... ""too"".","I think this was a great idea for a book, but...The people are too simple. Their language is too simple. The emotions are too simple. Jadwiga is too beautiful. Paul is too much the bull-headed, in love husband. The story is too simple. The descriptions of the wedding traditions were succinctly described but not used in the story as part of the life of the characters. As a result, I just sort of skipped over the descriptions which were the best part of the book."
4,Great story of the hardships of Polish immigrants; well written,I love the writing style of the author. It was very educational about the hardships of the Polish immigrants. I didn't realize how they were treated and the hardships in general.
2,Doom with robots; but BAD,"A very bad game. You have only 3 weapons to use and very few items. You are constantly in narrow corridors, which makes your robot hard to move and avoid damage. yawn. OK. At least the maps are randomly generated for most levels, but all the levels are very unimaginative and they all have the same goal: Find the exit and get to the next level. The game is a definite challenge in the later levels, and the between stage and opening movie sequences do look good. That's the only reason I gave this game 2 stars. If you are a fan of Doom, stay away from this game. PLEASE. It will make you cry tears of sorrow."
1,Pant Hangers,I thought I'd try these pant hangers because the weren't as expensive as the others I bought that I loved. Well you really get what you pay for. These are very poorly made. The rubber was falling off the hanger before I could get them hung up. I am so disappointed. So that is my option and just giving a warning.
2,Not what I expected,"I'm not completely pleased with these hangers. They are not very deep, so part of the pants/slacks hangs over the open end. I also thought the surface of the hanger would be covered with something sort of fuzzy that would grab on to fabric, but they are covered with a ribbed plastic, so the jury is still out on that aspect as to whether or not it will keep slacks from sliding off the hanger."
2,Wish I had spent more money and gotten better ones,"These hangers have two problems:1) The bar is good 3 or four inches higher than the bottom of all of my other hangers. Therefore, they look like a mess in my closet, as they don't line up.2) The plastic part over the bar is completely loose, and slides all over. So if you don't have your pants weighted properly, they can slide right off. What is the point of having plastic on it at all, then?If you want your closet to not look like crap, do not order these."
3,Not Quite Wide Enough,"I'm a large guy (40 W, 36 L), and these hangers really aren't long (wide) enough. Some of my pant leg invariable hangs over the outside edge of the hanger. Th he construction is excellent, however, and the are heavier-duty than I expected."
2,Huge horrible,"The antenna is huge, dosnt work pretty well. not recommended if you want to use it in a car."
1,Don't count on this book,"Warning--it's very tempting to look for THE book to give to your skeptic friend or loved one. DON'T.As a born-again Christian, I can say that this is not the book for many reasons, some of which are explored in the negative reviews. This book compromises theology with an Al Gore-style ""say anything to win"" mentality. When Greg encounters difficult questions, he simply changes the bible or interprets it inaccurately.It's interesting--Greg likes to use the ""it's winning many converts"" line to convince you that it's a Godly book. This conclusion is a fallacy...if the conversions are based on faulty theology, are they true conversions?Having gone to Greg's church several times, engaged in several conversations with him, I can tell you that he is way off base in many key areas. Do not place your trust in this book or his theology to reach the unreached. I would much more highly recommend ""Mere Christianity"" by C.S. Lewis."
5,Great,"Answers a lot of tough questions. Very thought provoking. Good read, also made me cry for joy for his dad."
4,Good read!,"I would have given it a five, but there was a bit too much philosophizing from the son. The father's questions were refreshingly honest."
5,This book addresses the reality of Christianity,"I have read and studied the Bible and Christian literature for years and though I have a good grasp and strong faith, I am usually sadly lacking in evangelical skills. This book addresses the reality of Christianity - and cuts through to the Truth that can set even a Skeptic free. It is a treasure for anyone tired of Christian hypocricy and the sappy illogical evangelism that turns off logical thinkers. I bought one for each member of my family. IT IS A MUST READ FOR EVERY PERSON!"
2,"Good questions, silly answers","The questions in this book are good worthwhile questions that everyone should ponder, Christian or not. The answers are frequently superficial and sometimes logically inconsistent. I found the point about God not knowing the future to be outright silly if not blasphemous. Get anything by Philip Yancey if you really want to examine these issues."
3,Foreknowledge does not necessairly mean Predestination.,"Although I have not read this book (and therefore obviously cannot offer a review of it ;), I feel compelled to offer my opinion on the subject of God's omnipotence. C.S. Lewis says in Mere Christianity that if you consider the idea that God is outside of time (for him all times are one), which seems to make sense in the context that he is eternal and unchangeable, than of course he knows the future. However, that does not affect your ability to make your own choices and exercise your free will. Can you see the truth in this?"
3,Interesting and Pointed,"Intresting, and makes you think. May make a believer out of a skeptic,well written and readable,. Thought provoking, sometimes I had to read it over to understand"
3,it's OKAY,"I had this coffee at our local country club. (I was a guest!) Then my employer started using it.I can't get my home recipe down. It just doesn't taste the same. Then I found out that what my employer uses is already made and is in a cardboard box (like some wines), so the taste is always the same --- delicious. I will continue to work on my recipe."
2,too bland,"Can't make the coffee strong enough. I'm sure it's good if you like mellow coffee, but I'm Cajun and grew up on very strong coffee. Will not buy this again."
5,Excellent info on the higher end of Win2000,"Mr. Nielsen's book is excellent. I needed a quick and complete intro to Active Directory and its implementation and this definitely fills the bill. For 30 bucks, it is a real bargain. He seems to have really gone over the Microsoft Official Curriculum and broken some fingernails getting a Win2000 network up and running. Where MS gives you a paragraph, Mr. Nielsen may give you two pages. This is good. There is not much here on Win2000 Professional or mundane stuff like printing, but that is fine."
2,REAL EASY,"This was a very easy game to finish but it was still fun for a while. Even if you are a novice gamer you can still finish this one in about 2 weeks. But there was a major problem with it. There was so much footage that we never got see that involved the relationships between the characters. The plot always took over just when the voyeuristic appeal was setting in. There was never any way around this so the game almost followed the same path every single time. The ""revelation"" at the end was pretty disappointing and the climax was all over too quickly. It stars a young Corey Haim, R. Lee Ermey and Debbie Harry."
4,Nice to have item when its hot outside...,Quality of the product is good. I hung it at edge of the roof in backyard...It cools appx. 10sq ft. of area easily.
5,Kept us cool on a summer day,"Worked as promised. Kept the party cool during a hot summer day. There were some reviews stating that the nozzles aren't pointing in the same direction. I found it pretty easy to point them in the direction I wanted. I liked how there was no water dripping from the connection at the faucet, just make sure you use the rubber washer that's provided. We'll be using this all summer."
3,Be careful - Color is not White,Product looks nice and I'm sorry I can't use it- unfortunately my Pergola is white and this item is almond color - just assumed from pics it was white as I want it to blend in not stand out.Also - I went to Orbitonline - learned 20066 is portable - meant for umbrellas - 30066 is for more permanent installations - only now understand the differences
4,Worth the price,"This is a easy & cheap alternative to keeping cool in the heat, however I took off a star because there is no setting to control the amount of mist (even when you try to control it at the faucet). But, since it is hot who cares if you get a little bit wet."
4,fit our needs,"It works, not great but did get my money's worth and then some.Our chickens we having heat stroke, no mater what we did. We purchased Orbit 20066 and hung it above the enterence to the chicken coop (approx 4 ft away). The chickens we're able to stay cool and no more heat stroke.It did get the ground wet.You do have to clean out the pins VERY often.But look at the price? You do get what you pay for."
5,Great Mist System,So far this mist system has been a lifesaver for our backyard. Texas heat this year has been brutal and the mist makes our patio area nice and cool for people and the dogs!
3,Overpriced,"I haven't connected the unit yet. However, I've used one before and was happy with the results/outcome. The only thing I am not happy with is the price. The day after I received the item, I saw the very same unit selling at the local Lowes for $9.99 (their regular price ;-(!"
3,"Not a fine enough mist, otherwise a good product.","I purchased this product hoping for a fine mist that would evaporate in the air. Unfortunately, while some of the mist was small enough to evaporate, there was also an excessive amount of spray. Even hanging 10 feet in the air, the patio under the line got wet, as did our patio chairs. The most annoying part to me was that my glasses got far too many droplets on them.With that said, assembly and set up was a snap. I connected it to our garden hose and everything was simple. Rather than purchasing a mesh filter like another reviewer suggested, I simply stuffed a cotton ball into the hose fitting and it filtered the water without incident."
3,"Nina in Hillsborough, NJ","Great color, great quality, great cushion....not so great smell. So bad I haven't been able to use it since I bought it - still ""airing"" out that amine (fishy) odor. Stinks terribly even a couple of weeks out of the packaging. Hoping for warmer weather so I can hang it outside! Did not have this problem with my old, cheapy yoga mat."
5,THE BEST LIVE R&B SAX ALBUM EVER!!!,"I wore out more than one copy of this one. I've been a professional sax player for 39 years, and a King Curtis fan for 38 of them...this is simply THE BEST! Thank you Atlantic and thank you Amazon!"
1,King Curtis at fillmore weat,"The music is great, BUT do not buy this CD from The British retailer mentioned in the buy list. IT can not be copied. Morever, it will not go on I- tunes desk top softwear. A real rip off"
4,Fillmore Heat,"Very good live recording of King Curtis and his band, featuring a young Billy Preston on organ. Some odd cover choices (""Ode to Billie Joe"" is just one eyebrow raiser), but the songs are all given a trademark jazzy, funky makeover by King Curtis. Maybe not the legendary live performance that some people say this is, but the music on here does indeed pack a whallop."
5,Great instant coffee!,"I'm a big coffee drinker and have high standards, but this instant coffee is great. It's perfect for my husband and I who are on different schedules, you can fix a quick cup whenever you want one."
4,Better than Brewed,I prefer Mt. Hagen instant coffee to brewed coffees. It's also organic. Not sure if it's Fair Trade; if so I would give it 5 stars. Wonderful aroma and rich smooth taste.
4,"Aroma & taste fine, caffeine less..","First, let me tell you that i didn't buy this coffee from Amazon as they couldn't ship it to my default shipping address. I bought one bottle for 6euro from my town market.The aroma and taste are fine! However, this is the first organic coffee i try. What i didn't know and it doesn't write it anywhere on it's label is that the amount of caffeine in every organic coffee/tea is less than the regular one. So, now daily i need 2 cups of coffee instead of one i used to drink, in past."
2,Che - AKA Che Guevara,I did not like this movie. Che speaking in english? What the hell? Is not culturally right
4,"The real-life, whacky World of Warcraft","Continuing a great series. The characters are wonderfully quirky and entertaining. If you enjoyed season 1 & 2, you will enjoy sesaon 3."
4,"Inpirational, Passionate, Spiritual","Jaci Velasquez is the embodiment of grace and beauty. The Holy Spirit is definitely speaking through her voice. ""Speak to Me"" is the best track. Buy the CD and let the Spirit speak to you."
5,My DVD,"Great family movie would recommend it to anyone , no profanity and thatS why I decided to start collecting JEANETTE OAKES DVDS"
2,"Great Company, so-so slippers","Great company. They were very nice on the phone and I had no trouble returning this product and getting my money back. The slipper was nice except for a very uncomfortable elastic band that goes across the instep on the inside of the shoe. My wife tried to be nice since it was a gift, but couldn't get used to the feel so I returned them."
1,they list the wrong songs false advertisement,"The songs that are listed on the the web page for disc 2; NONE of the songs were on that disc. I am disappointed in the false advertisement of this cd, there is NO ""creepin"", ""if only for one night"",or ""dance with my father"".The Essential Luther Vandross"
1,Back to the Library,"I thought it read like a high school term paper. The writing is at best sophomoric. He relies too much on pseudo romantic tales told by players with an overblown opinion of themselves, and the misguided politics and policies of our government of that era. All of which we are paying for now. Nothing learned in this short book. Elisabeth Swan"
2,You get what you pay for,"This is a cheap tire in price and quality. The tire that came with the bike worked for a couple years, with many hours on a trainer. This tire is falling apart after only a few months on a trainer."
4,adequate,"I couldn't sleep directly on this. It's too firm. I used two, side by side under a queen air mattress to elevate the head area.A bit pricey. All bedding accessories seems to be though.It might help with acid reflux if you sleep on your back. Seems nothing helps if you sleep on your sides."
1,Really bad stinker,"I really like the first three books by Kerr. That led me to read further on -- first his *Philosophical Investigation*, big mistake, then *Gridiron*, amusing but not more and now *Second Angel*. What a dread. The only interesting character appears for a few scenes and is out much to early (Rimmer). All others are genuine ... cardboard. The dialogue is laughable at best and downright annoying most of the time. The story has big holes in it and is predictable from the first page on -- I actually knew everything that follows after having read the first 75 pages. But the worst thing is that the book with all its footnotes, explanations and insertions is boring to the limit. And, all those explaining is superfluous. If I could I'd rate this waste of paper -5 stars!"
3,"Good Concept, Poor Execution","I loved the idea of using blood as a commodity, and making class distinctions based on 'pure' blood. Also, the vision of the development of a virus-plagued future society was quite eerie. I could see how we are moving down that path today.However, I found Kerr's writing style stilted, and the overuse of footnotes annoying. Also, the narrator's tiresome and long-winded monologues were boring and unnecessary.Better luck next time, Mr. Kerr."
3,Too strong for me and caused gas :-(,"This is definitely a laxative...not just fiber. Look closely at the ingredients and you will find not only bulk, but soap, magnesium and miralax-like ingredients.I also did not realize that it has calcium...so that means it interacts with some of my meds.So I am back to Benefiber (or equivalent substitute such as Walmart's Equal).My GI Doc said only take these ""Fiber-Tabs"" for occassional (stressed occasional) constipation...NOT AS A SOURCE OF EVERDAY FIBER !!!"
1,Does not compare to fiber con,Be careful and drink a ton of water or you might regret it! I always drink a lot of water but this requires excessive amounts beyond other similar products..
1,"Solid Plot, but the author doesn't pull it off","Allington comes up with a excellent plot idea, however his prose fails to capture the reader into the time and place of the events. Also the dialog sounds tacky. Again the story is solid; after a couple more drafts, who knows?"
5,A fantastic guide for antique fishing lure lovers!,"Carl F. Luckey's paperback book is a must have for all lure collectors! It's a great guide, easy to read, easy to find what you are looking for! It is divided up into small groups to make it really easy to find what you need!We are so glad we bought this book!"
3,"Useful, but not the best choice","If this were the only book on MySQL that existed, I'd be pleased, but with the release of MySQL by Paul DuBois, this book has been obsoleted."
2,"It's okay, but I knew SQL already.","It wasn't much help with using utilities like sqldump and such. And it didn't help out much with MySQL, which is what I use the most. It mostly covers MSQL and only mentions MySQL, it seems. But as a query reference, it has worked just fine."
3,not the best but good enough,It's not the best book about MySQL but it helped me using it with Perl.This book assumes you got basic knowledge of Perl.
1,Not recommended as a reference for MySQL,"I was disappointed by this book since O'Reilly normally publishes a more organized book/concept. If you have no or minimal experience with RDBMS products then this might be an appropriate book for you. If you are familiar with RDBMS products and are looking to transition to MySQL or looking for a solid reference to MySQL, then I recommend that you look elsewhere."
2,"Ultimately disappointing, but there are some good parts","Like other reviewers, I was also disappointed with this book. I believe it was the first MySQL book to be published, and like other first books on an Internet/technology topic, it feels a little rushed, in that it lacks depth.While others have discussed the flaws (and I don't disagree with them), there are a few good things about this book:* It's reasonably well-written and edited (if a little shallow).* There are some good (light) examples.* I liked the section that compared mSQL and MySQL with the other free databases, and explained what was missing in each. (In a nutshell, Postgres is more robust and full-featured, while MySQL is considerably faster.)Ultimately, I can't recommend this book (which saddens me, O'Reilly's books are among my favorites). If you want more SQL info, go with The Practical SQL Handbook (or SQL for Smarties, if you're advanced). If you want more MySQL info, go with Paul Dubois' book."
2,Msql coverage incomplete,"I bought this book to begin implementing Msql but was disappointed in the many holes in key information areas. Since I have only been using the book for a few days or so, I expect to find many more deficenicies. For instance, in describing the data types supported by Msql it describes the date data type simply as a ""Standard date type"". What the hell is that ??? '01-01-99' ? '01-01-1999'? or as is more common in Mysql '1999-01-01' or even '990101'? After a long search on the internet it was found to be '01-Jan-99' with the month being case sensitive....aarrrghhhh More examples of key details not working or being incomplete were found in the section on connecting to databases from Perl. The book is biased and slanted towards Mysql, although I cannot say the coverage there is any better because I don't use Mysql."
2,For difference experts,"This book is for you, if your quest is to become an expert on the difference between mySQL and mSQL. As mySQL is a freeware/shareware product everyone has the manual, which good but is rather technical. I was looking for a book that expands it by practical examples. This book is not it."
2,Not helpful enough to get started with MySQL.,"I bought the book to help me get started using MySQl. I did not really find the information I was looking for. I still ended up searching the websites to figure out how to do things. This book is a good all around reference, but to actually use it to better understand the database is a mistake."
5,An old book can always give you surprise.,"The book is a classic one in the area on digital communication. Even till now, it has the reference value for the engineers which are researching on digital communication. I hope I have a chance to read it.I believe that it can do a great help to me."
5,TalentShow,"Product was purchased for talent show. It was beautiful. It was durable also, and all of the contestants wanted to play with it before and after practices and before and after the show."
3,Daughter likes it but I'm tired of fixing it.,"My daughter loves this, but the ball on the end that holds it all together keeps coming untied. It broke about the second time she twirled it. I guess the breaks after that just mean either I can't tie a good knot (!) or the string isn't good for holding knots. She loves it though, and it does look pretty twirling through the air in between repairs."
3,Good Birthday Gift,"I bought this item for my daughter's 5th birthday because she LOVES rainbows. It is a very fun toy and she was really excited about it. However, the ribbon is attached to the stick by a string that hangs out the end with a ball on it and this gets a little dangerous if not help properly. Perhaps this toy is best purchased for older girls like 8+."
5,Real Classy,Love love love. To keep these lovely glasses from breaking I don't over stack my dishwasher nor do I open it when its really hot because different changes in temperature will crack any glass in the dishwasher.
4,An Overlooked Gem,This game was one of the first games that I purchased with my Saturn. It is a competent shooter that will challenge you. The FMV sequences are a treat since they are acted well by people that I recognize. I definitely recommend this game if you own Saturn.
1,Eastern methods for a Western World don't work in this book,"The author keeps referring to two groups of PTSD sufferers (soldiers and child abuse victims) as being different from other trauma. I agree with this, but the author doesn't address how those two groups can heal. I found the book to be worthless and I have read quite a few on PTSD to come to grips with my own childhood abuse. The author uses eastern methods such as meditation and physical consciousness. For many trauma victims this is a very scary and at times inaccessible means of healing trauma. Levine writes that remembering the traumas is not important, while most of medicine believes it is. The crux of the author's theory is this: trauma is stored energy that must be released. No memory can be released without remembering something about it. For sufferers of PTSD this book fails and is a disappointment."
3,OK book.,This was an OK book. Tried to help me learn Majong. Maybe it's just me don't have enough interest in the game. I beleive I'll stick to board games for fun.
2,Not Satisfied,"I purchased this case to go with a Canon Powershot A80. The camera fits nicely and there is room in the little front pocket for four AA batteries OR a CF card. The problem that I really have with this case is that the sides of it don't go all the way to the closing flap. This would allow water to get into the main compartment, which stores the camera. If you only want a carrying case and aren't worried about the weather--this is a nice little case."
3,"a case for a camera, thats it","nice soft case, a little to soft maybe, which isnt good for a real protection. Looks nice with the canon A640. Would be nice if it was still small and slick, but had a couple more extra pockets for memory sticks, extra batteries, whatever..."
1,not good for canon a620 / No sirve para la canon a620,"Why do you want a case? to protect your camera.con: the case do not cover 100% of your camera, is not very well protected agains dust etc.Also It does not have a strap, belt or something for you to hold the camera. I do not wear belt, I do not have how to carry it other than inside my back bag or purse.Pro: good quality, etc.Contras:el estuche no cubre 100% la camara Canon a 620!, yo quiero un estuche para protejer la camara del polvo, etc, y no queda 100 cubierta con este.El estuche tampoco tiene una correa o algo para colgarte la camara. Yo no uso cinturon, asique solo puedo llevar la camara con este estuche en mi mochila o cartera.Ventajas:Es de muy buena calidad. Pero eso no sirve de nada, ya que no queda toda la camara cubierta!!Comprate otro estuche que puedas ver el tamanho en walmart!!"
3,At least it's cheap...,"Bought sight-unseen along with a Canon Powershot A95 here on Amazon. I commiserate with the reviewer complaining that the case doesn't cover the whole camera, leaving parts of it exposed (so it's not weatherproof). But it is nicely padded and will provide decent shock absorption for carrying the camera on a belt or in a backpack. The front pouch holds a spare CF card nicely, but will not carry both the card and spare AA's. I have a 1G CF card and don't need a spare, so I use the front pouch to carry 4 spare AA's. If not kept upright (e.g. on my belt) when opening the case, the spare AA's usually fall out of the front pouch and roll all over the floor. Makes me want to throw the AA's through a window; such outbursts are unbecoming of a man my age."
3,Good,Good One. Not having room to place the batteries. But compact and good enough to put my A560. Value for Money
4,Great protective case,"If you need something to store a lot of accessories in, this isn't the right choice for you. There really isn't room for batteries, etc. However, if you want to protect your camera (mine is a Canon Powershot A630) without adding a lot of bulk, this is perfect. I like to use it since my camera is a little big on its own and so I don't want a big carrying case, but I want to put it in my purse without risking scratches and other damage... this worked just like I needed."
4,Fits the A640 much better then the PSC-65,Those reviewers who are stating that the PCS-60 won't fit the A640 and alike cameras are mistaking the PSC-60 for the PSC-65.
5,"Good Price, Good Product","I just bought one of these for my Canon Powershot A95 and the thing is just perfect. It fits the camera like a glove, very snug so the camera doesn't bounce around, and there's a little pocket for an extra flash card as well. This case is VERY affordable, and it does exactly what it claims it does; it protects your camera. Now, this isn't a case designed for a professional photographer with plenty of room for spare batteries and other junk. It's also not waterproof, fire proof or accident proof. This is simply a nice comfy little case to use when on a quiet vacation or to carry your camera around from place to place while in your home town. Simple, cheap, and well-made. I recommend it."
3,Works for me....,Does what I want it to do. Keeps the camera protected from small bumps. Also keeps the camera handy on the belt. I really wasn't expecting much more for the price.
4,Statistics without talking down,"I have just begun as a consulting statistician, and have found this book invaluable both as a review, and as an aid for explanations for the people that I help. The book goes beyound the bare basics, with very useful discussions of statistical package use."
4,One amazing game!,"I have to say this- I've played many video games. Of all different consoles and types, but NiGHTS is still #1 in my list of favorites. Literally, Flying through a 3-D world where the imagination has no bounds, NiGHTS is one amazing game. And the music is no exception! The music was composed beautifully, and sounds perfect, if not better. I completely recommend this game to anyone who is even thinking of buying it. You won't regret it!"
2,Welll,"I gave it to a used book store. It wasn't terrible, but if you really want to read it you should try to borrow it from a library instead of spending money on it. It just got a little cheesy here and there, and there, and a little over there too."
2,Annoying things about this book,"The crude obscene language which the women use, both in direct quote and in relating what they will do, was bothersome to me. I cannot respect a woman who stoops to such gutter language. I was also annoyed by the apparent approval we were expected to give to the central character's belief that her cloistered twin sister was ""throwing her life away."" The scenario is pretty incredible, and the out of wack reaction Mary has when she gets mad seemed so stupid for a smart lawyer, and made me wonder how smart she could really be. I have no intention to read anything more by this author."
4,Nice book,"I have recently found Lisa Scottoline. I really like her story telling ability. She writes well and I love that it is a quick read that really brings you into her books!! This book however, was one of her early works and had more foul language than I liked. Her later books are fabulous!!"
1,VERY BAD,WAITED 21 DAYS NEVER GOT THE BOOK. THEY SAID AFTER I E-MAILED THEM A NUMBER OF TIMES I WOULD GET A CHOICE AFTER 21 DAYS TO GET THE BOOK OR CREDIT. WELL I NEVER GOT A CHOICE THE JUST GAVE ME CREDIT NO SORRY JUST CREDIT. SO I WAITED 21 DAys FOR NOTHING!
2,"3rd edition is somewhat outdated by now, needs to be updated","I bought this book specifically to learn how to write a block device driver for CentOS 6.3 / RHEL 6.3Alas, Linux has moved on since the 3rd edition was printed (2009) and kernel functions used in the example code, like elv_next_request(), or macros like blk_fs_request(), have since been *removed* from Linux, rendering this book somewhat obsolete.For my driver, I need worker threads, and these can be implemented by means of workqueues.Workqueues are a very important tool for the driver writer - basically, they are the kernel equivalent of user-space pthreads. If you want your driver to do things in parallel, you pretty much have to use workqueues.Unfortunately, while there is a section on workqueues in this book, this section is rather short - just a few pages long.All in all, this book did not meet my expectations."
3,Two good actors. One ok film.,"It's OK. There are some funny moments, but Bride Wars is not a must-go-out-and-buy-it-now DVD. When it comes around on cable, you could watch it while sorting the mail. I wish I could give it more praise, but this uneven comedy is just not worthy. I genuinely looked forward to seeing this film because the premise was quite appealing. It just went nowhere.Ultimately, it's just a so-so chick flick."
2,100%,"This is a 100% chick flick. My wife and I alternate movie picks and this unfortunately was her pick. There are many girl friendly films I do end up enjoying, but this was not one of them. This is really a shallow concept that might work great as a half hour sitcom, but stretched out over a full length film it just comes off badly. Two best friends who have always dreamed of having a fantasy wedding get engaged at the same time and by accident have their weddings booked on the same day. Getting mad, they both start sabotaging each others wedding plans. Good actresses and a good concept in theory made me have high hopes for this one. But a sub par formula script that isn't very funny sink this movie."
3,A predictable distraction,"I typically do not watch 'chick flix' but the wife watches some of mine, so I reciprocate. It was interesting to see Hathaway and Hudson stacked up against each other. I believe Hathaway to be the better actress even though the credits listed Hudson first.Although the script was predictable, it was still enjoyable. It did become a bit tiresome about 3/4 of the way through the film. But if you are looking for 90 minutes of distraction, this will do nicely."
2,Humor lost on scattered script,"The movie took awhile to get started, but there were a few good laughs and ""dirty tricks"" between the warring brides leading up the the ceremony.Spoiler warning: However, the whole reconciliation twist at the moment of the wedding was: a) unbelievable (why would she readily discard her caring and thoughtful fiance? b) totally deflated the humor out of the movie. Largely a dud that wasted an easily amusing topic."
2,Not that Good,Considering the great actresses involved in this was disappointing and not what you call a save DVD. Really a very simplistic Plot and Anne Hathaway and Kate Hudson tries hard on the tired script.
3,Cute fun fluff,"Kate Hudson and Liv Tyler were both pretty funny in this. For the rom com that it is, it didn't disappoint at all. I feel like Anne has played this character enough times though."
3,Good time had by all...,"Ok when I got married I didn't have to go to war with my bestfriend. This movie was very funny, you can't take it to seriously and I don't believe the director or actors were thinking they would get any sort of awards for this movie. Some movies you just have to sit back with your friends or family and a big bucket of popcorn and enjoy. For the story, both actresses did a very good job, it's cute and there is always a happy ending right? I have to say I did enjoy watching the movie, if your a fan of Miss Hathaway or Miss Hudson I thinkk you will enjoy this movie."
2,Should've been PG-13,"This movie was OK. It wasn't as good as I had expected. I was a little frustrated because of some of the scenes and topics of discussion through out the movie. They each lived with their boyfriends/fiances, too. There were a couple of references made about them sleeping with different guys. There was a scene that was in a strip club that should've made it PG-13. There were scenes showing people drinking alcohol. The story line was pretty good, but I think it could've been better without the sex & alcohol."
2,bride wars...,Another shallow movie with no real depth....wish it would have been a better movie.Two best friends decide their friendship isn't worth a wedding at the plaza! Just plain stupid.
2,Not that good,"Again this is a surprising situation where a lot of talent is wasted. take an idea that can almost never go wrong: a wedding comedy from a female perspective plus some really great actresses: Kate Hudson, Anne Hathaway. and Candice Bergen. However the script is not really that funny and the direction is not great. A waste of time unfortunately."
2,I made it all the way through but I don't know how.,"This movie is about life long friends who due to a scheduling mix up for 'The Plaza' have their weddings planned for the same day. So, of course, instead of working things out, they pull hurtful stunts on each other and in their pettiness, ruin relationships. Emma and Liv are shallow and mean and I found it difficult to like either of them. The acting in this film was nothing special, but then the script was so weak, I could not see how anyone could produce a really 'good' performance. This movie was torturous to watch with no laughs and a predictable ending that I saw coming very early in the film. I gave it 2 stars only because I made it through to the end, which is more a testament to my determination than it is to the greatness of the movie."
1,very strong garlis odor! very disappointed,"I guess you get what you pay for because unlike nature's bounty or any other vitamin company product those pills have a very strong garlic odor &they make you burb all day !! will not buy this product again from this company, however I like other Swanson's supplements like vitamin E , cinnamon supplements that have good quality & are priced reasonably"
2,Another Side Scolling Genre,"This is just another side-scrolling game with no new gameplay elements to make it stand out from the rest.The 3D graphics are decent but not that great and the sound is not great either, gets boring after a while.The only features I can mention is its attempt to add more dimensions to the standard side scroller but it makes the game resonable more difficult and not as enjoyable since sone crucial targets are in the backgrouns and you got th destroy then or else you will find that you will just lose a life and start from the check point again.I would only recommend this for side scrolling lovers or fans of Iron Man and X-) Manowar, otherwise its best to stay clear of it."
3,Ehh,"Lily Trehearne is on the run from a pompous arrogant fool who believes he can force Lily to marry his son. Using his close relation and subsequent guardianship over Lily her father's cousin, a pastor, informs Lily that it's God's intention that she marry his lily-livered son. Lily runs - with the authorities hot on her tail.Though born a lady, Lily hides as a maid in the home of Devon Darkwell, Lord of Darkwell manor. She can't hide her true nature for long and is soon loved by all but the threatened housekeeper.All Lily wants is love but his lordship refuses only that - will love conquer all? Or will the housekeeper have her way?Hott ReviewThis was a bit different. It took a while for me to grow interested in the book because the writing style isn't what I normally read. It's definitely a steamy romance but it's more on the line of women's fiction or drama than the comedic romances I generally seek."
2,"Interesting tale, poorly written","I purchased this book to gain insight into the experience of Greek immigrants as research for a project of my own. While it provided the information I was looking for, it was difficult to get through. I have less problem with Douros' skills as a writer as I do with the job of his editor and publisher. They could have done a better job of bringing this book up to snuff."
5,Never Grow up,Very Cute great quality. My son loves it he couldn't wait to wear it so we had to open the package in the car and change his clothes into the costume. We ended up shopping with a Lil. Peter Pan at Costco! LOL. Can be worn when ever where ever =)
3,ok,"This is the story of Kendall who works at a hotel, Kendall's ex boyfriend; Jack ends up staying at the hotel with a new girlfriend. Kendall and Jack still have feelings for each other, and try not to act on those feelings. Kendall was also having a relationship with a married co-worker. She also made other decisions in the book that I thought was careless on her part. I guess the book was okay, I felt that something was missing; it was just okay for me."
4,enjoyable read,"It's not an over the top romance novel, but an enjoyable read none the less. I'm glad I was able to read about old friends re-uniting and not have chapters of flashbacks. The characters are original and realistic."
1,Poor Reception,I have installed two antennas in my area for two houses. One with Antennas Direct Clearstream4 (C4) which is smaller in size and more manageable and this one (Channel Master 4228HD).Getting the best reception with the C4 was a lot easier eventhough it is located in low elevation (but roof top).The 4228HD was unable to get 20 channels of the ones C4 was able to get even though it was on a house on hill-top and on a mast considerably above the roof.4228HD has very poor reception. Tried Winegard AP/8700 preamp and it got me only 2 more channels.Not recommended at all.
4,Cut the Cord (or Dish),"After 15+ years of Direct Tv we decided to start saving $90/month. After building a homemade antenna [...] ; which works very well for UHF, however we needed a single antenna solution.Purchased this item and was up and running in minutes. Works well across both spectrums; mounted in the attic. I am a bit worried about the balun as it seems a bit fragile, but we will see. Overall a great purchase."
5,For me it works in attic from 28 & 55 miles,"I am between 2 cites, 1 is 28 miles and the other is 55 miles in the opposite direction. This antenna picks up the 28 mile stations no matter which way I turn it, so I faced it towards the 55 mile stations. It picks those up, plus the closer 28 mile ones behind it. It also picks up a couple off axis stations that I didn't expect.I bought a length of 1.25ID PVC pipe for five bucks and attached it to the attic trusses. Then mounted the antenna to the PVC pipe with the included u-bolts.UPDATE: I added an amplifier/splitter (4 port, 8db gain from Radio Shack) because the TV with the longest co-ax run had dropouts while the other tvs were fine. Now all the stations are solid and I even gained a few more."
4,Index is very good,"Index is very good. This book sometimes just provides small sections of code instead of complete examples. You might also want to consider ""PERL: Essential Programs for Your Survival at Work"" by Larry L. Smith."
2,The book was not at all organized. Not very good.,I have been to seminars where Tom has spoke and enjoyed his presentations very much. I found the literature he gave out on last years LISA conference was which was only ~180 pages was more informative. I thought the book jumped around too much and did not give complete enough examples/explanations.
1,had to interject here...,"Okay, I'm sorry but did that kid just say that this was one of the better monster movies he has seen. Hey kid, go rent Relic.Thats a good monster movie with a fairly believable beastie.The monster in this movie looks like something doctored up for a cgi spot on a Fruit Loops commercial. The acting is relatively decent for a B movie, but the plot is ridiculous and shallow. The love scenes are contrived and the whole movie collapses under its own false pretentions.This movie is a must no- see.Thank you for your time and believe me, you will thank me for mine."
3,Not many facts,This book is based heavily on anecdotal evidence. There are few numbers to back up its claims. Still pretty interesting when looking into the mind of a superstar.
2,Uniframe 4 fold door fireplace screen,"I ordered 2 screens early Dec and received only 1 unit, End of Dec I called Uniframe asked for the status of the missing screen and did not receive proper response, they simply passing the buck to other party."
4,Last Chance to be...,"A SCOTTOLINE Fan!!Your last chance to win being a fan of the action and suspense of a SCOTTOLINE book is right here. If you read and enjoy the dog romping fun and tender emotions of this book, you win!"
3,pithy,"it was fine as a fast mystery read, but not up to scottoline's usual standards. wouldn't care to read again."
5,Superb Linux Book!,"I don't ordinarily write reviews, but I must say that ""Running Linux"" is the authoritative book if you're interested in Linux. Whether you are a beginner to the Linux OS or an advanced Linux user, this book has it all. It covers everything from installation to programming. There is no other book available now that is so comprehensive. This book is definitely ""your one stop shop"" for all your Linux needs. No matter who you are or where you come from, this book is more than worth it's cover price. Put it on your shelf today!"
2,Could not find anything on the date command,"First it advices to use emacs as editor. a program which made me almost smash my computer, you can't get out if you don't know the nerd level of this program.(use pico) On essential comandos like FIND it only writes a few lines. And the worst, I did not find anything on the DATE command. It is not in the index !! There is ofcourse also a lot of usefull info in this book but don't buy this one if you are a novice on linux. My conclusion, buy another book."
5,"I'm a windows expert, but didn't know much about linux/unix",This told me all the important stuff I needed to get going and understand how linux works.
4,Intermediate to advanced reference,"This book is an excellent reference book for administrators and/or intermediate to advanced users. If you are new to linux, skip this book and opt for the O'Reilly title ""Learning Linux"". There are several titles out for different distributions. The book sticks true to it's description in the ""About this book"" section where it describes itself as ""...(giving) you enough background to find out more on your own"".I caution anyone who intends to use this book as a reference for building a new or custom kernel! The information presented isn't entirely accurate and lacks some depth. If you are new to this - pick a different source.Overall - the book is an excellent reference book for power users and intermediate users looking to exploit the power of Linux."
4,"Review of ""The Royal Australian Navy""","This is a well written book - Volume 3 of a series""The Australian Centenary History of Defence Services"". This volume is written by 6 contributors including the editor Dr D M Stevens.All the contributors served in the Royal Australian Navy.The first chapter deals with the formation of The CommonwealthNaval Forces from five colonial naval forces and then the creation of the Royal Australian Navy in 1913.The conflicts in which the navy was engaged are covered in some detail as well as the periods of peace with all the professional and political problems of how the navy should be developed.There are good black and white photographs as well as fold-out plans of significant ships. There is a list of major ships giving the fate(i.e. sunk sold scuttled etc) of those no longer in service.Also of value is a list of abbreviations for reference - for exampleit may not be known to everyone that a DDG is a ""Guided MissileDestroyer""!"
2,Rat Hell,"This book was good, however it begins like its the middle of a book and ends like it hasn't reached a ending. Like someone took the middle of the book out and made it into its own book. No beginning, no real ending.The story takes place in a prison during the Civil War and the Escape from that Prison. The Prison is Real. Libby Prison."
3,"Good book,but too short.","I lived in San Francisco for a while, and I love this book, which is kind of about the secret history of that city: The odd artists and debutantes that circulated there in the good old days. I just wish this book had been longer. But, the other review is right about the layout of the book: It looks great. I've got my copy on a stand on my bookshelf. I hope someone writes a longer book about Cecil Nixon someday."
4,A real character,"I bought this book because Cecil Nixon was Anton LaVey's mentor. There is some good behind the scenes stuff about Anton LaVey in this book. The author, Doran Wittlesbach, also puts out a magazine, called ""Bloody Beautiful"" that I love."
5,this is THE Book,"Don't look further, you've founded the book you wanted to get into de games business. Explains from scratch how to design, develop and even how to create your development teams for games. With case studies, more than 700 pages, this book is your bible."
4,Pretty good stuff.,"I have one complaint, though... the author really underestimates a linear game driven by plot. If you look at Final Fantasy, there's one of the most linear types of games around, yet it's probably one of, if not the most popular."
1,Should Take Architecture and Design out of the title.,"This book was misleading. I bought it in hopes of learning game designs and architectures. This is not what the book is about. This is book is about game developement process, documenting, and good planning. It does NOT cover anywhere ACTUAL DESIGNS. Not to mention that every chapter says the same thing over and over again, which I can sum up in one sentance. Plan well, document, and where possible reuse code. Thats all this book says. It might be a good for people who already know how to design games on doing a better job, but thats it."
1,WHAT A RIP OFF!!,"First of all, I had scoliosis surgery in June 2010 and it went well. I have no pain!! I was looking for a pilates type DVD to help with stretches and core strengthening. When I checked out this DVD, it failed to mention that I would need to buy WALL SPRINGS!! Who wants to buy more stuff when I just bought the stupid DVD for $20! I never even opened this, just read the cover and now not interested. I checked on returning this and it says FINAL SALE. Nice of them to leave this off when you place the order. Seriously, do you think someone with scoliosis feels like hanging from their door frame on wall springs?? Get real! The DVD also says they recommend series two. I bet they do, so they can get another $20 off me?? I think not! If you are still interested after reading this, email me & I will sell you this one."
5,MAGNIFICENT AND SHEER BRILLIANCE!!!,"Sheer brillaince is teh only way to describe this highly enjoyable set of standards and blues treasuries. This cd is on a par with his classic lp's from the 50's. As a matter of fact, BB sounds so inspired and youthful taht one might think this was recorded in 1954!!! WOW!!! I love BB's smooth crooning voice, on tunes from the great American songbook, such as I Love You For Senimental Reasons. And for sentimental reasons I love this cd, and I'm sure you will too. For thsi cd casts a light on the shadowy truth that BB is more than a blues singer, but a singer who can sing standards with a blues feeling as alberta Hunter, Helen Humes, Jimmy Witherspoon and Jimmy Rushing all had once done. BB continues to be the finest male singer today, and he's still goin' strong. this is timeless music, with subtle guitar spots for BB, but again this is a showcase for hsi warm baritone rather then his guitar genious. This cd and concept for BB is sheer genious!!!"
2,Huh?,"What dunderhead empty suit came up with this idea? The very concept of B.B. King, America's greatest blues singer, crooning a bunch of standards just shows the kind of inept decisions that today's record labels make. You can just hear the imbeciles at the label: ""Rod Stewart did it, Linda Ronstadt did it. Wow, standards records are ALL the rage!"" Well, all this CD will do is make B.B's fans rage. The reason ""Reflections"" isn't selling at all is because (all together now) NOBODY WANTS TO HEAR THIS KIND OF STUFF ANY MORE. If I was B.B. King, I'd fire my manager and get somebody in there who knows what he's doing. There's not enough blues around these days, so what do we get? B.B. King, a national icon, singing non-blues. Brilliant! What's next, polkas? Two stars only because it's B.B."
1,Not Very Imaginative!,"I purchased this ""curriculum"" sight unseen for my then three year old and almost immediately wished that I had saved my $25 for something far more worthy.While most of the literature selections for B4FIAR are wonderful it is the activities themselves that were a real turn-off. They are common sense and rather unimaginative to say the least. I would have to say that at least 90% of the activities were things that I would have done with my son even without the book. I don't need a ""curriculum"" to tell me to drop blueberries into a pail after reading ""Blueberries for Sal"" or to talk about the weather and clothing choices while reading ""Jesse Bear, What Will You Wear?""In my opinion, save your money, buy some good children's literature and come up with your own activities... they're bound to be at least as creative if not more!"
3,"Re-mastered, but not restored!","The case boasts of the shows being re-mastered, but there are streaks in the backgrounds from negative fading.These are the later 1980's Depatie-Freling TV specials, not the classic Chuck Jones cartoons. (The Jones toons are issued by Warner Brothers). They have their creative moments, but much of the time they feel like cheap imitations of Dr. Seuss.The Hoober-Bloob Highway is the superior of the two shorts.Why only two 22 minute shorts? Universal could have gotten all four of their Dr. Seuss DVD releases on one DVD!"
2,Some positive and negative issues,"This is a great addition for a family who often travel. It is easy to use, adaptable, and convient. The problem that I face is that I have had three of them in the past four in the past four months because of malfunctions. In theory, this dvd is great but the people who make this product need to to do a better job."
2,Choppy sentences with drab illustrations.,"Short choppy sentences with one page in color and the next in black and white left me wishing this book was done differently. Loving nature, I wanted to really enjoy this story, but I didn't. There were facts thrown in haphazardly with thoughts and there was absolutely no reason for the black and white harsh transition every other page into color. I just didn't get the concept the illustrator was trying to portray. I did like that the pages were made out of paper that felt like it was recycled just for this tree story. And the introduction of, ""Trees are very nice. They fill up the sky."" was a nice way to start this book, and the ending of, ""They wish they had one so they go home and plant a tree too."" leaves you with a positive activity, but the rest of it was drab for me."
1,boring and old fashioned,For me the books is kinda of boring and it never capture my child's concentration. It's a disappointment.
2,Definitely not ready for prime time,"I have been beta testing this game for several weeks now and, unless miracles happen between now and release, you will get very weary of dealing with all the bugs. Ok, the graphics are awesome and the music is cool, but this product is very far from being ready for prime time. Even the simplest, most fundemental things are still broken, and most of the game elements (trading and manufacturing, for example) have not even really been tested yet."
1,Bad Ending,"The Book was a good read to a point, But it violated my requirment for reading pleasure by killing all the good guys and letting the bad guys win..??? Whats that about?"
4,"Mansion of the Hidden Souls, A review","Mansion of the Hidden Souls is a interactive mystery game developed by Vic Tokai. The game is the sequel to the Sega Mega CD game Yumemi Mystery Mansion. The version I purchased was the Sega Saturn version and here is some pros and cons of the game.Graphics: Pro is that they aren't that bad for the time, con being that they are rough and somewhat hard on the eyes at times.Story: In depth and fun at times, the story tends to lead you into the mystery but not fully taking advantage of story interaction at times. pro/conGameplay: Some times the interaction takes both getting use to and makes you repeat controller inputs in order to get a reaction, as a con. The pro being that at least the movements are quick and you get from point A to point B in less time then some games.Overall, I'd give the game a 7/10. Not great but not bad either if you like point and click adventures or interactive puzzle games like Myst."
1,DVD player w/ NO KARAOKE!!!,First of all the quality is not good. Related items like ones by Colby are better and cost around $25 in stores. It doesn't support any form of karaoke...do not buy.
4,ok,"this is a decent set, and it made a good gift. dad is still using it after all this time. i would buy it again for a gift."
5,Livia bee Pollen Lip,This product is great. It feels good on your lips. It makes your regular lipstick stay on longer too. I use it in the morning when my lips are really dry and it stays on a long time.
5,A Perfect Book,"This is one of the most beautiful books I've ever seen. The illustrations and the story complement each other perfectly. I got so lost in the pictures and the words that after closing the book I was momentarily confused by the sunny day outside.Two other reviewers said they found the book hard to understand, which puzzles me. Are they bewildered by the idea of going outside in the dark? Or that a parent would take a child for a walk into the fields and woods? Their confusion says much more about the reviewers than about the book."
5,"FINALLY, an accurate, inspiring, outdoor fun childrens' book","I love this book...the first time I read it, I cried. I am an environmental educator and have used it several times in my owl programs. Adults love it just as much as children.It was a great introduction to owling for my 3 year old niece. I brought her out one night into the woods and we hooted for owls. Amazingly enough, ""her friend, the owl"" hooted back (her father was hiding in the woods!). The whole walk back through the dark and the snow, she kept looking up at me with utter adoration, telling me, ""THANKS, Debbie!"".This book will touch you."
1,"""Whiter than the milk in a cereal bowl""?","If that is the kind of metaphor that constitutes ""great writing"" (let alone POETRY!), then we are in some serious trouble. Compare this to Robert Louis Stevenson, or a.a. Milne, or - on the art front, Jessie Wilcox Smith or N.C. Wyeth. Curious George (originals) blow this out of the water. If you want a little beat poetry, at least go with Margaret Brown's Little Fur Family. This is a great example of the typical ""dumbing down"" of culture in our society. I will no longer be using Caldecott medals as indicators of quality."
5,Beautiful story,I used this book in my classroom as an example for my students to write thier own story. My 3rd and 4th graders loved the story and it worked great for the lesson I was teaching.
2,Owl Moon,"I found that even though this book contained good illustrations, it had no real meaning. I thought this book really did not make a solid connection with the youth today. The most positive value of this book is the ilustrations. Its appealing qualities leave much to be desired."
5,Three pearls of number theory,"A jewel. Highly recommended for students of number theory, expecilally amateurs and teachers."
1,Less Than a 1 Rating,"Too bad there's not a rating for ""less than 1"" rating. I am a Cafe del Mar fan and had high expectations for the Chill House No. 1 cds. Wow, what a disappointment! While listening to the tracks on the 2-cd set, I kept thinking ""Man, this sounds like reconstituted disco of the worse type! This music is awful and a waste of my hard-earned money. I am very disappointed with this compilation from Bruno."
1,"Panasonic TH-42PH9UK 42"" Plasma HDTV Monitor","The product was not delivered -- I spent a day waiting at home, missed a day of work.I was told the product had been lost in transportation.I asked to be reimbursed. They promised to do so quickly. My credit card has not yet been credited for the amount.All in all, a frustrating experience."
2,Why do I watch these things?,"After enduring a large number of zombie movies, I've come to the conclusion that if you've seen one zombie movie, you've seen them all."
1,Not what it used to be,"I have all of the series. I became a fan during Jean and Lionel's trip to Paris. I loved how they explained everything about their past, how they reconnected, and the finishing touch which was their wedding. Everybody else was just a minor character. (Alistair is my favorite though) When the series focused more on the younger people, Jean switched to the role of being more nosey and saying Lionel Lionel all the time. Lionel only throws in a good word once in awhile. With the reunion, Harry is someone different, Judy and Alistair don't share a connection much, nobody mentions Madge (Joan Sims died in 2002) and they ruined Penny and Stephen. I liked them more when he was still a dentist. The only special I have is You Must Remember This. I shall pass on the reunion special. The ending was left unfinished to me."
5,fantasticly funny,"I have always watched this show and have the complete set, just looking at Lional and Jean's faces makes you laugh without them saying a word. This is a must set if you like British Comedy"
4,special DVS,"I enjoy it the show very much and like to be able to watch it whenever I wish, not having to wait for it to show on my local PBS station."
1,Please stop writing misleading reviews!,I bought this book with a lot of expectations but to my disappointment found the book to contain shallow material on XML and examples (mostly trivial) that show how to use Beta APIs like JDOM. Most of the examples in the book are developed using JDOM and would somebody venture using beta api in production environment?Right now this book may be useful for reading from cover to cover and possibly in two days! Don't expect the book to give you examples or any useful information that can help you write code for your product that is going to be deployed in your customer's site.
3,Brief Introduction,Just scratching the surface of XML & JAVA. There is more than XML can do with Java that will blow your top away!
2,"Book is weak, but XML gem inside","Some useful overview material, but the winner is the reference to Breeze XML Studio in the references section. This tool has saved us more time with XML and Java then we could have possibly imaged. Better books exist on XML and Java, though."
2,The title should be XML and Java,"Why? Because there is too much emphasis on teaching XML, which by the way, is not done that well either. A better book to learn XML is the XML Bible. Anyway, I bought this book not because I wanted to learn XML, which I know, but because I was intrigued by the title. I thought I would get a hardcore look at XML from a Java perspective. Not so, though."
1,Long winded and boooooring,"This book is excrucatingly long winded about nothing.The cover jacket sounded interesting - an exploration of early 20th century Austria, Jewish mysticism and shtetl life and revolutionary politics.Instead, it was a tedious, monotonous, never-ending exploration of the internal workings of characters I couldn't care less about. Paragraphs sometimes went on for 1-2 whole pages without any dialogue or action. It wasn't until the last 150 pages that ANYTHING actually happened. Prior to that the author simply told the reader what his characters were thinking and feeling. I found myself skimming the last 150 pages just to say I'd finished it. In the end, the actual events were meaningless and miniscule and most of the characters and their situations were left without resolution."
2,"Worked well, while it worked","You get what you pay for. Cheap brand, chintzy product. Did it's job well for the 2 weeks it worked, then it was RIP. Oh well"
4,MR. PUMICE!!!,"I don't have a lot a problem with my feet, hands or anything. But this is the perfect product for my skin to KEEP it soft when I get pedicures. My husband does my pedicures and sometimes I do them on my own but we both liked the product. It's not too coarse where my feet get that burning feeling but it's just right for that soft, clean, spa feeling."
1,Corrupted files,"I was very excited to buy this audio Bible so I could listen to it on my ipod. Then, when I went to download it to my computer, it gave it a virus! Now my computer won't boot up and goes through a loop whenever you try to start it. I'll most likely lose all of my files when I take it to a computer shop. I'm very disappointed. This might have to do with it being an MP3 version instead of an audio CD, or it might have just been a bad batch. I'm not sure, I just wanted to make this known :("
1,False Teaching,This is not the Bible - but a single person's interpretation of scripture. A mere word study against the NASB or KJV will illustrate the heretical teaching of this book. I am horrified that pastors and other so called leaders are quoting this new age book.
3,"Small print, transparent paper",This is my first Message bible. I love this version and the pink color of this bible but the words are so small and crammed together. Also the paper is very transparent along with the light color of ink makes hard to read. Not worth the price should be less.
5,The perfect Translation,I bought this for my daughter because the NIV just wasn't working for her. She loves the translation and the product is well made.
5,Love this bible!,"This bible is amazing! I looked at it in a Barnes & Noble, but it was $40. I purchased it at Amazon for about $25. I am a senior in college and can really connect with and understand God's word using this bible. I recommend it to any young adult! Everyone thinks it looks really cool too!"
1,False Teaching,"This is NOT God's Word but a pathetic PARAPHRASE that waters down the gospel to appease men. I urge those who think this paraphrase is so great to hold it up to real scripture. This is just more humanistic attempts to redo God's Word. Stay away from these books. 2 Timothy 4:3,4 KJV or NASB!"
1,May God forgive us,"May God forgive us for even publishing a piece of garbage like this. To call this ""God's Word"" is unthinkable. This trash does not even remotely resemble a ""bible"". It is awful even for a paraphrase. Even a paraphrase is supposed to come close to saying what the original translation tried to convey. This is New Age double speak. Verses are twisted so far out of context that they are not recognizable. I am not talking about manuscripts or literal vs. dynamic translations. This goes beyond a bad manuscript or a bad translation approach. This story book is not supported in the biblical Greek or Hebrew at all. If you truly need an easier-to-read English translation of the Bible, try the New Century Version or NLT. Don't even get one of these if it is free. Mine went in the trash."
2,Poor print quality,"I was disappointed and distracted by the print quality of this edition of The Message, which I purchased as a gift. There is significant bleed-through, making the text difficult to read. I checked hard copies of other editions at a bookstore, then returned this edition to Amazon and ordered another edition with better readability."
4,This is the first book to read on XML,"This was my first book on XML. It is great for anyone using HTML as it explains: the differences between HTML and XML, the reasons for using XML, its history from SGML and also where XML seems to be heading.Finally it contains coded examples that can be used with a XML parser.If you do not understand namespaces, DTD (just changed) and what a parser is then buy this and get reading !!!!"
4,Very useful introduction to XML,"I bought this aout six months ago and found it very useful as an introduction to XML. I had been following XML on the Web, but still found this to be a great learning tool. There are now many more books and resources on XML, but I would still recommend this to any HTML professional who needs an introduction to XML."
2,TINY!,"I thought this was a great deal until I opened the package. It is teeny tiny (about the size of an actual wristwatch face) and rolls over easily. I bought it for my boyfriend for his birthday and he likes it and puts it on his desk, but I'm not sure if he's just being nice. I probably wouldn't buy it again."
4,Great Knife,"I own an older 'non hollow' version of this knife. I guess the hollow groves are so that vegetables don't stick. Mine seems to work just fine without the hollow groves. I am very impressed by the quality of the Henkels Four Star series. The ice hardened blade is very sharp. It does need a sharpening steel for regular maintenance. The blade is great for cutting raw meat and vegetables, but a bit thin for chopping frozen meat or bone. It's not a Cleaver. The one piece handle is very durable and dishwasher safe. I don't have to worry the handle coming loose. I was worried about that with the Five Star series. The Santoku shape is very versatile. I considered buying other Henkels knives, but this one is so versatile that I don't really need to. I've had mine for 7 years and it's still a great knife."
2,read people!,"you guys should really educate yourselfs and read. these dvd's , not books or magazines , are documentarys on pitbulls. they are not supporting dogfighting. simply educating the un-educated about these dogs that in my opinion are the best dogs in the world. if you'd like to be upset about something , go to your local dog shelter and look the amount of homeless pitbulls their are that will probly get put to sleep because they are unwanted due to their reputation. adopt a pit today!! i have 2 already , they are the best dogs on the planet."
1,"I was totally ""Baited & Switched""","I've been trying to order this diaper bag for months. I understand the pale pink ""Mothership"" bag is discontinued and is now being replaced with the darker pink ""Love Knots"" style instead. I ordered the ""Mothership"" bag weeks ago, through Amazon - but ultimately through [...], and later found out (only after I called to find out where my order was) that they no longer had the ""Mothership"" style - only the ""Love Knots."" Needless to say, I was very upset. They did refund my money, but it would've been nice for someone to call me and let me know that I wouldn't be able to get the exact bag I wanted. Several weeks have been wasted, and I'm due any day now...with no diaper bag!! Very disappointing..."
2,Not delivered as shown,"Although the product was delivered in a timely manner, it was not delivered as shown in the graphic. The background was all black instead of the mountain view shown on the website."
1,"Nothing like Woolf's ""To the Lighthouse""","I couldn't bear to watch the whole DVD--it was too different from one of my favorite books, Virginia Woolf's ""To the Lighthouse."" Like the recent ""adaptation"" of John Galsworthy's ""The Forsyte Saga,"" this seemed to have little in common with the literary masterpiece behind it except for the setting, the title, and the names of the characters. Very disappointing!"
1,useless,"I have been trying to figure my way around. The code snippets contain several errors which is left to the reader to figure out. It claims to be for beginners, but everyone agree that this book is unsuitable. It contains too many bugs, examples are very badly explained."
3,Good general reference book,"Use it as a first read on aconcagua, but not as a specific guidebook. It's too general, but it's a good first read, or a good book to give you a more general idea of your options when planning an ascent in this fun mountain."
3,maurice freedman,i think this is the only book on maurice freedman. he is an interesting modernist artist.
4,Back to the Front:,"I actually bumped into this CD quite by accident. Who ever thought we would hear more from Front 242 after all these years?I must say I amazed by the quality and craftmanship on this CD. All too often I've been disapointed when returning to new offerings of the 'old' industrial giants.'Loud' is absoloutly flawless and evokes memories of the sweepeing soundscapes and the introverted philosophy of 'Up Evil'. Strobe is magnificent example of precision. Morphs from background music in one form or another is so fluid it's impossible to pinpoint the actual change.Why not five stars? Let's face it, this CD is brutally short. Only four original songs with two remixes. This is like a bad striptease where we are left frantically groping for more. Cross your fingers that they will release additional tracks."
4,"Perfect for the basics, not as good for the advanced feature","Like all of the ""Nutshell"" series, this book is a detailed language reference with little or no ""how to"" value. Even so, I learned more about Perl from this book than any other I've read. The basics of the language are well documented and easy to apply when you need to. The second portion of the book deals with the various modules available for Perl. It is in this section that the book begins to gloss over things and becomes far less useful. Even the examples in these areas become more confusing. If you need a reference for the language basics, the book is wonderful. For the modules, it is little more than an overview, leaving you with an understanding of what they are used for, but not always how to use them."
5,Brilliant book.,"This is a book whose brilliance is not in its authors' mastery of English. It is just the most eloquent book I've found on any programming language. After a certain point, you just want a book to lay out the language's syntax clearly; if you desire to 'grok' the philosophy of perl, you look at other books or read the preface. This book doesn't tell you how feature x is strong, or make jokes about how deprecated feature y is weak. It lets you decide for yourself, and gives pointers to other books that contain these comments. I of course don't recommend this as a starting text if you're a little new to programming, or don't quite understand what Perl is useful for.I don't know if this book needs more examples, but if it does, I hope they're placed at the back of the book. As it stands, this book is very clear and useful."
2,"Sorry O'Reilly, this is not in Nutshell class","I think this book is weak both as a language reference and as a source of tutorial examples. The description of the language itself is accurate enough but tends to only state the obvious, rarely showing those clever ways to do things which illuminates what Perl is so capable of. I think Programming Perl defines the language and how to use it well more thoroughly and includes far more clever and illuminating code snippets. Learning Perl is the perfect starting tutorial for those new to Perl.75% of this book (pages 165-619) is just a list of the more popular modules available from CPAN and each of their methods. I would only recommend this book if you wanted this in printed and bound form."
5,"A Sincerely Written, Moving, Portrait of a Young Woman","This book is a great book if you want to find out about a young role model. Obviously, this book is not Tolstoy, but the point is not for it to be a great book, but a great story, and that it is. This story is truly inspirational!"
2,wonderful story that i couldn't put down,"Heart of a Champion is a fabulous book all about the ups and downs of Michelle's career. What I like is how Michelle talks about other things, besides skating, and how she got started. Michelle's book is intruging and, in some parts, witty. Overall, this book is enjoyable. This is too good of a story to miss! If I had the choice, I would give it 10 stars! Go Michelle!"
4,Works well for me...,"I didn't have any intentions for this thing to dry my hair so I wasn't disappointed in it at all. It really could be bigger though. I have bra strap length curly hair, so it's ideal for plopping while dressing or makeup."
1,Only for those with very small heads,"This is a great concept, but they need to make them big enough for those with normal sized heads, with full heads of hair. Mine was waaaaaaaaay too small, even with stretchy microfiber.I bought three, so I have three dust rags now. :( At least they were cheap!"
2,Not the best product,"I was happy with the speedy delivery but wasn't impressed with the product itself. I have owned a twistie towel for years and I have gotten pretty used to it. I wanted to update and get a new one but this brand is definitely different then my original. The towel itself is too small to fit the entire head but the more annoying point is the material. The static cling attracts everything. Overall, I will continue to use the product until I can replace it."
2,Doesn't serve its purpose really,"I bought these because they were inexpensive but I have been disappointed. The wrap doesn't really hold hair all that well and it definitely doesn't dry. The microfiber material doesn't soak any water and is actually slippery in a way, it keeps falling off defeating the very purpose why I bought this product."
4,On the small side,I love these towels but this one is more suitable for a child or someone with very short hair as it is small.
2,Just a short clip.,I mightr have liked it fine if it had been the whole story. I didn't realize I was getting just a short version of the story.
5,great short for Tangled fans!,I think the reviewers who gave this a bad review needed to pay closer attention. THe short is great! It's not a full length movie- because it doesn't exist!! It was totally worth the $2.99 for the clip. My daughter loves to watch it all the time!
1,Headline/Title did not indicate that it was a short film.,This Title did not indicate that it was a short film on it's heading upon buying and we purchased it before we even knew it was a short film.
5,Very quite,"This was very quite, it made you watch every minute, because it moved very fast. It was excellent. You can see a lot of the characters from the movie tangle perosnallity."
5,Great Tangled Short,"My daughter loves Tangled so when she found out there was a ""second"" movie, she was all over me to get it for her. It didn't disappoint, and she laughed and laughed at all the hijinks in it. My only complaints are not being able to get it on an actual DVD and that it could have been longer, but then it wouldn't be a short. :-) That said, it was worth the $2 I paid to see my daughter enjoy it so much."
2,Do not waste your money,I bought this thinking this was more of the tangled ever after movie only three minutes of this movie. do not waste your money on this better to pay for the movie than get this small snippet.
1,Does Nothing but nice spray bottle.,This was one of the few products I purchased to curb appitite. I have been using it for the past week now and it does absolutely nothing. Will be returning this item if I can.
5,Just a Wonderful Product!,"I've been using this product for years, and these days, the only place I can find it is online. I always get great comments from people who notice the fragrance from either the deodorant or the cologne. I only wish it were more readily available like it used to be. This is a great product, and the vendor was excellent to deal with."
2,Waste of my time,"I thought that this video was so strange becase you would have to know a lot about music theory and almost nothing about singing to watch it. It also had almost zero actual technique or exercises that you could practice. I was excited about it, because I'm interested in non-classical, non-white western european approaches to singing, I'm a singing teacher, but this was just sad. The woman seems unprepared and uncomfortable throughout the whole video."
2,To be honest,"To be honest as a singer wanting to explore different opinions,i found this dvd usefull, yet a bit of a rip off by the way it is advertised. If a total beginner spent money on this item they would be left clueless. There should be some sort of grading to dvds instead of making people think that everyone will benefit from this. So a little honesty goes a long way.!!!"
5,Sound choice has the BEST Quality karaoke tracks in my opinion!!!,"This listing is for a brand new Sound Choice Star Series Wedding Music Vol.9 CDG (SC2352).This top of the line CD comes sealed in a heavy plastic jewel case, plays the music without the lead vocals and displays the lyrics on a Karaoke CD&G; player. This is a Multiplex CD which has the 8 songs without vocals as well as the same 8 songs with guide vocals to help the singer learn the song before singing it in public. These songs are not preformed by the original artists but they are probably the BEST re-creations available.Sound Choice Star SeriesWedding Music Vol. 9 - 2352Stereo Performance/Vocal Tracks1. This Gift (Radio Version) - 98 Degrees2. Hero (Radio Version) - Enrique Iglesias3. I Knew I Loved You - Savage Garden4. Yellow - Coldplay5. Love of My Life - Brian McKnight6.

5,Just What I Ordered,"(Bought from PROMISED GIFTS) I bought this as a gift but it came in perfect condition, like new. By this point I had stopped learning Java but it seemed as if it was a great collection of codes that would be beneficial to have on hand."
4,Nice book if you have expirience in programming C++,"Again a very good book from O'Reilly, it is readable also for those who speak English as foreign language. But this book is a summary, if you want to write Java applications you can't learn it with this book, then read Java for Students."
2,Second Edition is useless...,"I can't comment on the third edition of this book, but I do have to say that the second edition is great for fireplace kindling. My associates and I were required to buy it for a Java course we took back in March of 2000, and since then, I can't remember a single time when I consulted it and found the answer I was looking for. Case in point: I wanted to double-check on the exact syntax of a switch() statement, and all the book said was, ""The switch statement is much the same in Java as it is in C."" Hey, thanks a lot. That really helps."
1,What about the coffee?,After reading this book I am no closer to understanding the secret of coffee. I assumed I would learn about gourmet coffees and home grome coffees but no! .
3,Useless as reference but decent for C++ programmers,The reference is no where near as good as the API docs included with the JDK (and the book is also very outdated). However it's not bad for C++ programmers switching to Java.
1,Just a printed version of java documentation,"If you filtered out all of the non-original material in this book you'd have a pamphlet. It's basically a reference, although with a reference you typically count on it being right 100% of the time and having a decent cross reference, but neither of these are the case. It makes me wonder where all of these 5-star ratings are coming from... did they really read it and use it, or do they just think it's cool to have on their desks?"
3,ehhhhh,"ive listened to lots of bands and when i heard this cd , it sounded too much the same .i dont think they really sound like papa roach like everyone is saying .. papa roach had an ummphh , something that atleast had a kick to it . These tracks bore me and it sounds like they just put this cd together in 5 minutes . i give him credit for having a nice voice but they need to work on this a bit more , its lacking . The lyrics are plain stupid and simple , i was waiting for something to be said and then came the chorus again looping over and over.This isnt worth the money , download the songs if you must . try the band Matchbook Romance ."
4,"Catchy, Pop Punk definitely worth a listen.","This is one of my old junior high/high school buddies' band. Jassen (vocals) has definitely come a long way with his singing ability. He shows strength, range but still keeps that angst edge in his words. His lyrics are a definite improvement from yesterday years. The rest of the band proves themselves as a hard driving pop punk instrumental piece. And, the guest vocals by Papa Roach's own Coby are a nice touch. Brings back memories of when both their bands shared the stage numerous times in Vacaville, CA. Unfortunately, Die Trying is over. But, will re-surface with a new musicial edge and different members as Vanity Kills. So, if you enjoyed Die Trying like I did, keep an eye out for Jassen's upcoming project sometime this year. Truthfully, 2007 should be a good year. New lyrics, new drive, new hooks, and new improvements."
3,R&D help strengthens the focus of leading hightechnology fir,The policy that strenthens the focus of leading high technology firms is concentrating R&D on one or two areas. Such startegy enables these business to dominate the research. Their commitment to R&d is both enduring and consistent. It is mainteained through slack periods and recessions because it is believe to be in the best long term interest of the stockholders.
1,"another bomb, not worth buying",If you are looking for a book that has tons of sample programs that don't work. this is the one to buy. The author's knowledge of distrubuted computing is very questionable. it seems he just finished reading some articles and books by others and thinks he is ready to teach the world how to do distributed computing. I am very disappointed.
2,Not worth a time,This book is not friendly for begginers and good for nothing for advanced Java programmers. Save your money for something else.
3,Not a bad one,"Although many reviewers were not statisfied by this book, I do not think it is that bad as they have described.In my opinion it is useful enough for people who are just getting into the distributed java programming. But if anyone is searching a specialized book for a certain topic like RMI or CORBA certainly he will be disappointed. I can say that it is quite instructive (specially chapter 3, distributed object) and gives a general idea, it will give you the sense of the distributed applications. I am very convinced that beginners/students will find helpful areas in it.Finally it is for BEGINNERS/INTEMEDIATE (exclusive)"
5,A Very Detailed and Helpful Tool,"I studied programming in school but had trouble grasping many of the concepts of programming, so dropped my studies, but continued trying to learn these past few years on my own, venturing in to Visual C++, Visual Basic, and a few others. I gave REALbasic a shot just for fun, and was doing ok, but the Definitive Guide has taken me farther in the month since I got it than in the past years with any language. Now, finally, I'm comfortable enough to purchase the full language and have fun with it.This book is much better than many of the textbooks I've been through and other books I've purchased for various languages."
2,Not good with wifi,"I bought this in order to use with a Bluetooth headset in order to make Skype calls. But whenever it's active, my wifi connection seems to be dropping in strength so the Skype calls are not good.Wifi and Bluetooth both use the 2.4 GHz spectrum but Bluetooth is supposed to work around it to find a frequency that is not used. I guess this unit does a poor job of it. I found the Motorola PC850 works much better (even though it's only bluetooth 1.2)"
1,"Poor match with Mac Pro, poor support","Belkin Bluetooth USB +edr Adapter Class 2; V2.0Installation on Mac Pro went OK, but after restart Bluetooth is Off on the Mac and may only be switched on by starting the setup procedure again. Belkin's advice: Apple software is the problem. Apple's advice: we don't know Belkin."
