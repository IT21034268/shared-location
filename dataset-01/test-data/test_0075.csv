2,"I Like Violent Flick, BUT","I love the Godfather series, as well as Goodfellas, but this movie just didn't seem to have anything other than violence (I had similar feelings about Goodfellas, but not quite as intense). The sound track sounds like something that you would hear in an adult film. If you are watching it for violence only, this is your flick! Other than that, not much good to say. Maybe all my friends hyped it up just a little too much. It was a let down."
3,Very Good movie,"First of all, I would like to say that this movie is very educational. It teaches us about the dark aspects of human nature that lie deep in our minds--'the American dream' as it puts it. We may not be able to live it, but seeing it the way Mr. Montana does it gives a certain thrill.Now to my review of this Anniversary Edition dvd set. Contrary to what you may think, I disapprove of its layout (which is why I didn't buy it). I really can't stand the fact that the DVD makers had to put a bunch of illiterate rappers on such a great film. I would have to say that this is a travesty to what the movie really stands for. Maybe if they added Al Pacino or Oliver Stone commentaries... I wouldve understood... but a bunch of idiotic ganja-smoking rappers. This takes my vote down 2 whole stars."
5,5 for the movie 1 star for the dvd,"This is trully the best movie I have seen , thats includes the godfathers part I&II. Alfredo Pacino accent was so real,he sounds more cuban than I do. This movie was alittle too lng but it works... Pacino plays the accent well, sounds just like dominicans in New york, but he is right on with the curse words because not many immigrants speak english and its much easier to learn the slang that proper english. This movie paints a realistic picture of how a small time crook gets to the top and how the american dream can become so corrupt.The ending is a little far fetched but its a great way to go out. The dvd showed horible, for a movie this good it could have gotten at least a better dvd. I hope they make the dvd again so i can buy it. Best ...movie I ever saw ma'ng lol."
5,SCARFACE...Most Outstanding Movie Ever Made,"wow...scarface is by far the best movie ever created. i recieved the dvd from my girlfriend for christmas and it was one of my best gifts. after watching the movie for 3 hours, i wanted to watch it all over again when it was over, which i would never do with any other movie. usually when i watch a movie, when its done im like ok i wont be watching that for like another 6 months but this movie is UNBELIEVABLE. the music in this movie is so perfect. its awesome how tony montana starts off a nothing, becomes the most popular guy in miami, and then ends being a nothing after getting involved with drugs. if anybody says this movie is bad, that is your opnion. but the FACT, my friends, is that SCARFACE is the best movie ever released...ever... watch it people! BUY IT!!! peace"
4,Best movie,"This movie shows two friends going through tough time in life. Movie does not have a lot of special effects, but the action is packed with surprizes. This is one of the best acts of Alpachino. good movie you should watch it."
5,Scarface DVD,This is one of the greatest movies of all time. Al Pacino does an unforgetable performence as Tony Montana. But the movie is not great just because of Al Pacino. It's filled with extrodeniary talent on and off screen. With unforgetable cast of actors and actresses that bring unforgetable characters to life. Briand De Palma does an amzing job of turning this movie into a modern day Godfather. And last but certainly not least Oliver Stone. Oliver Stone does a magnificent of writing the screenplay to this movie. No doubt in any critic's mind that this film will stand the test of time and become one of Hollywood's greatest film's.
5,Greatest Movie Ever,"This is the best movie i have ever seen. Their is alot of violence and coarse language in this, but it just adds to the realism of the movie. It follows the life of Tony Montana as he comes over to America to go to straight to the top of the drug game. He is a man that gets so greedy and kurupt with power and still wants more. Quite a long movie but every second kept me interested. If you are into gangsta/crime movies you should of seen this 100 times by now."
3,Good But Not That Good,Scarface is a good movie but its not that good the performance of Al Pacino is simple amazing. Thats the only reason why you should see the movie the thing I don't like about the movie is Al Pacino charcter hes just to fake. Its just fake no one would have a mind like that but the performance is something differnt his performance is very good but the charcter he portrays is fake. As far as the violence goes its really not that bad compared to films like Meance II Society and Casino its nothing. But the violence is still bad and is for mature audences only.
1,Worst mob movie ever.,"Scarface, no matter what anybody tells you, is a god-awful piece of garbage. From the ridiculous synth score, to the totally unwatchable and unbelievable violence, to the final stupid sequence of the film with the infamous ""say hello to my little friend"" line, this movie is just wretched. Brian DePalma is quite possibly the worst director ever about putting style over substance, and this is his bloated disasterpiece. Al Pacino is one of my favorite actors and even he couldn't save this junk heap. Not to totally throw all the blame on DePalma though, Oliver Stones' awful script is a lot of the reason the film is as bad as it is. When Stone is good he's really good but when he's bad, he's terrible. All of these other reviewers on here must have seen a different movie, or maybe I just missed something about this three hour pile of crap. I don't know, but if you want to see a great mob movie, watch Goodfellas or the Godfather. Not this. Save yourself the trauma."
2,You get what you pay for.,this was a bootleg. there are problems with the menu graphics and there are two places where the video skips. other than that it was worth the money.
2,sound quality,i bought this edition the movie is great but the sound quality stinks. this movie should be returned and redone on the sound side of it. i was very disappointed
2,Boring. The original is better,"People fell for Al Pacino overacting all over the place here. There is not one single shot that he is not on screen, it's annoying.If you look below the surface, this movie is long just for the sake of being long, morose and tedious. Performances are usually high, but here not here. Yes, gasp, this is a shallow movie at its core, wrapped in violence to disguise it."
3,Great interactve menu- picture image..not good,Don't get me wrong this is a great movie...when I saw this on blue ray..I knew that I had to get it..but when I started to watch the movie and noticed in the opening scene. With Tony being asked question..I saw that the picture was not cleaned up..like in some parts of the movie...I still love the movie..I just wish that they should taken more time on making it better...
2,Not as good as the radio sketches,"I loved Duck's Breath starting with ""Dr. Science"" sketches I heard on Montana Public Radio. My parents bought my brother their tapes after we all enjoyed Dr. Science so much, and my siblings and I wore them out with listening. These on-stage sketches are pale echoes of the zany humor captured in the audible-only versions of their work. It's just not worth watching. It only gets two stars because I loved their radio work so much."
5,Love the D-38 Line of Straps,Thick and heavy-duty. They look great too. Nice heavy ends as well. Great bang for the buck in the strap-world!
3,"Some compatibility issues, but otherwise fine ...","This is a rebadged Sigma Designs Real Magic Hollywood plus card and you will need their drivers for it to work well under Win98 and later. This card and the Voodoo2 do NOT get along, they use the same mechanism to switch the VGA stream and your system will lock up if you try to run both.On the plus side, it makes it possible to watch DVD movies on even a ""low end"" Pentium II or Celeron system. I ended up putting my card into the PC that had been my previous desktop, and running the Svideo output right to the TV. Works wonderfully and the movies don't ""glitch"" anymore.If you already have a DVD drive in your PC but movie playback is jerky and/or you've run into DVDs that just won't play with software decoders, then this is a great upgrade. I you just want another DVD player you can buy a cheap one for the same price as this card and a DVD-ROM drive so this isn't that great a solution."
4,Beyond the expected realms of conventional sound..,"It's certainly worth repetitive airplay on a system with LOTS of bassssz. You'll find yourself coming back to this album and discovering how simply intelligent the music really is. Given the timeframe since his previous album (Low Profile Darkness) I would have expected something more ""revolutionary"" in concept however Panacea's style is undoubtedly distinctive and Twisted Designz harks back to his earlier work with the revival of numerous samples. Believe me..your speakers aren't broken..it's supposed to sound like that!"
3,Didn't look like new,"It stated, ""used like new"". I was disappointed when I opened the box and found worn edges. It looked like a well used and loved collection. My son has watched the first disc and so far no scratches or damage. Definitely didn't look like new."
4,Romantic Adventure,"The Ship of Ishtar is one of the better 1930's Indiana Jones style pulp adventure novels. An archeologist unearths a miniature ship artifact that transports him to another dimension, where he becomes a macho hero, who, with the help of an interesting assortment of new friends, assists a lovely priestess in a battle against some evil warlocks. His adventures lead him through some wonderfully imaginative fantasy locales, and the book has a spectacular ending."
5,there is always something to learn,"What makes Wayne Dyer so lovable,( other than he was created that way,) is his use of personal experience and how it pertains to the material at hand. So many times in ordering tapes, I feel disappointed that the author/speaker seems to be talking at us instead of with us. Like Neal Donald Walsch, Dr. Dyer speaks of his humanness and how to incorporate the mundane life into a miraculous one with just the change of a thought. He addresses physical and emotional difficulties and how to begin to overcome them and well as constantly reiterating the value of acknowledging our Oneness. His truth is simple, but the truth is simple. The process of getting there is a different story, but in this set of tapes, I came away with one or two main thoughts and stories that will stay with me the rest of my life. And that's alot!"
1,Why would anyone want this book?,"It is a terrible book and it smells like cheese from a farm in which spirals downward into a living hell like the one in the Nickleback music video, ""Too Bad"" I really like that music video, and even more do I like the song. I have the cd. It Rocks!"
3,Claims go beyond justification but still valuable,"Like most people who assert a one-size-fits-all philosophy of life, whether religious or otherwise, Dr Dyer claims too much. He is not talking garbage, but neither are his views anything like justified. They are, nevertheless, interesting and I am sure anyone can find value in some of the ideas.I was powerfully struck by the poem ""I am"" from one of his readers. So much so, I copied it and keep it in my own personal library. ""I am. The 'I' that is me - you cannot see. You see only the form that you think is me. This form that you see, will not always be. The 'I' that is me - lives eternally."" -- Mary Lou Van Atta.The idea of my ego getting in the way of my peace also hit home with me. After considering this, when some driver cuts me off, or when the weather doesn't cooperate with my plans, I now ask myself, ""WHO are YOU? Do you really expect the world to conform to YOU?"" It helps."
3,There Is A Spiritual Solution To Every Problem,"The tape would have been much more effective if Dr. Dyer would refrain from the useless sidebar commentaries. He will begin to discuss a topic and then digress and tell 2-3 stories before coming back to the original topic. After a while, you totally forgot what his original intent was. The material is very thought provoking, Dyer just needs to stay focused on the points he wishes to make."
1,Very shallow pop philosophy,"I tried very hard to like this book but was quickly turned off by Dr. Dyer's protrayal of ""low level"" and ""high level"" frequencies that supposedly mirror different qualitative levels of thought. From these essentially unsupported constructs, he provides advice for living as if the entire structure is an a priori given. The commentary is very shallow bordering upon new age pop psychology. I found very little depth in the first one hundred and twenty pages and finally gave up on the book. If you are interested in something much more substantial and helpful, study more well thought out Zen or Buddhist texts that provide much more substance but do a much better job of conveying the ideas that I believe Dr. Dyer is trying to share."
3,A wonderful book,"I listened to the CD recording of ""There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem"". My first reaction was that Dyer's voice was often as helpful as the words of his book! You can sense his genuine peace and positive, hopeful nature, and that is contagious. Dyer's central message that we are always connected to God, and that we should approach life with compassion and a positive nature, is far more profound than it sounds. The only drawback to Dyer's writings is that they are occasionaly not completely realistic and he does tend to simplify. This is why I couldn't quite give the book 4 stars, but I still think it is a great and uplifting message and definitely worth a read (or listen)."
2,to fat,"the price is good, but the Cd's are slightly thicker than others and they stall in the MACS with auto insert cd drives."
2,Not a great deal when the media has too many errors to write,"The price was great per CD-R, so I thought I'd give it a try. Unfortunately, more than 20% of the discs had errors on them and could not be used. I have an excellent Ricoh burner and have never had any problems with the major brand discs I have always purchased in the past. I think that the storage method of placing them on a spindle causes too many problems. It's just not worth it when you waste your time trying to burn a disc only to be told half way through that the media is defective! I have enough coasters around my house....think I'll just stick with the majors and pay a little more for quality..."
2,Cheesey!,"I sure disagree with some of the other reviewers here...I almost didn't finish this book so many times.You can tell what's coming by page 27 when members of their team are variously described as ""most astute mind"", ""knowledge of guns...legendary"" ""best electronics expert the seals had ever produced.""The author's knowledge of guns is shown to be limited as he describes various guns (all using the same 5.56 cartridge) to be far superior to one another.The only thing in this book that flies more than bullets are the cliches."
4,Good product,"I have 2 of these showerheads. Work great on regular setting as they give a nice wide spray. Other 2 settings are okay, but nothing great."
3,Very Detailed... Too Detailed,"The good and bad of this book can really be summed up that easily in my opinion. The book is very detailed in its history, however, the amount of detail the book provides also gets in the way of the story. The first 5 or so chapters talks about tax collectors and stories of individuals. While it is interestng, for me, the amount and detail of individual stories takes away from the story of the revolution and all the events which lead up to it."
1,Motorola Bluetooth Headset H3 - Hate IT,Second time I have received an ear piece that arrived broken. It will not hold a charge and I expected better. I moved and can not find the package it came in. I have to eat it. No more on line ear pieces for me. Two bad apples is enough.
5,Very Pleased!,Very quick shipping of the three filters. The filters are the most up to date MWF version of the filters just like you would find at Lowes or Home Depot for a much better price. I would definitely buy from this seller again.
2,How to keep GE in the black,"In less than a year, our new new GE refrigerator delivered water at a snail's pace trickle, yet we have tap water that looks good, tastes good, and smells good. I see now that our Lowes delivery crew did a thorough installation job, including throwing away or hiding the filter ""bypass"" device.I feel stupid, having let GE into my wallet for a blatant ripoff!I've just now sent Amazon $12 for a bypass device and $35 for a new filter.I installed the filter. The water dispenser now delivers 500 ml.in 19.2 seconds. I'll measure the rate monthly, but I suspect when the delivery rate slows, I'll use the bypass device rather than a filter.In 20 years, I've never found a good reason to install a fancy water filter, but if I do, it will be in the primary drinking water supply rather than inside the refrigerator."
5,Great filter,This filter is as described and works very well. Our city water and ice does not taste like city water at all once filtered.
5,Good product good price,This product was the least expensive from all the retailers including GE. The product arrived on time. It was easy to install and I would recommend it.
4,in this case it's probably better to stick with the right filter.,"i did considerable research regarding the replacement of my parent's ge refrigerator water filter.using amazon mainly i decided to stick with original factory replacement filters.there were two other manufacturers who made compatible? mwf water filters.they were considerably cheaper in price,but i noticed the reviews were unfavorable on the most part.not going to take that chance.i scoured the internet for the best price on the ge filters and kept coming back to amazon.not cheap,but hey better than what i could find.very easy to install.make sure you follow the directions like letting it run several minutes or 1 1/2 gallons after installing it.i used a rubbermaid bucket to catch the water.the water tastes just fine to me.no complaints.they say to replace the filter every 6 months."
5,Great price for this item!,I have a GE Profile refrigerator and was astonished at how expensive the filters were at Home Depot. This price was over $10 cheaper - what a deal!
5,Water Filter,"The GE water filter was exactly as described on the web site. It was the same as the stores sell, but considerably less money. Great buy!"
3,Listed incorrectly on website,The filter is fine and works for my refrigerator but the website is incorrect. It lists this as a 3-pack for $32 but it is actually just one filter. It came from Filters Fast and they seem understanding but the text is misleading for those thinking they're getting a GREAT bargain!!
1,2 month filter,I have always bought these filters from Home Depot and they last 6 to 9 months. I bought this one in December and it lasted until Feb.--2 months. Something is wrong!!!!
5,mr. ned chika,"every thing excellent, thanks, i receive the filter ahead of scheduleso far i am very satisfied with amazon.com i will recomend my fiends to buy thru amazon.com"
4,Uhhh...it's a water filter.,"It works fine. The water flows swiftly, is clear, tastes OK, and nobody has gotten sick. It's a success."
4,good,"i dont know what else to say.it works, but i cant really tell because i filter the water before it goes into the fridge."
5,Received and Works as advertised,The filter arrived and it works as advertised. Easy to follow instructions made it easy to install and flush for use.
4,Happy with it,"I suspect that you can get very similar filters for a lower price, but this is the original manufacturers filter and works well."
3,Basis filter,"Easy to install just twist and install. Guess it does its job, no complaints by me. Easy access to install."
3,Does what it should,"The filter is a basic filter for the refrigerator. It removes the chlorine taste of city water, and it's easy to install."
4,GE SmartWater Filter,This GE Smart Water Filter MWF works great. It's simple and easy to install. Instructions on the package are easy to follow. I purchased it from Amazon because it was about half the price compared with my local supply store.
5,what to say,"filters water ? what can you say, easy to install I dont know, it works ....ultrawoodcarving.com"
5,Water filter,"This fit our GE Profile refrigerator in our RV perfectly. Its the original equipment replacement. Just take it out of the package and install it. Remember to rinse it out since some carbon comes out of it with first use, but not much. It was a lot cheaper than a camping supply store, and even cheaper than Lowes or Home Depot. Good buy."
3,water filter,"First of all, I read the GE refrigerator manual on how to change the water filter. I did what it said, but water was coming out where the filter was. I had to turn off the water valve that connects the water line to the refrigerator in order to change the filter. After that the filter was easy to replace. Just remember to turn off the water before replacing the filter."
5,works and is cheaper than the ones you get direct,"It is not the european water filter version. It is the North American version. Worth every cent, my water filter is working perfecto!Clean water? yes please."
5,Good filter,I always recommend the OEM filter for the fridge. Super easy to install and does a nice job filtering the water.
5,Perfect FIt,"Item worked perfectly and installed in an instant. It was everything I expected it to be, and I would recommend it."
5,Examines the historian's relationship to past and future,"How we document and memorialize the past receives attention in a survey that questions the nature of historical scholarship in modern times. This considers the processes and nature of historical scholarship, using addresses and essays to examine the historian's relationship to past and future events."
3,"5 for show, 0 for marketing strategy","agree with other reviews, dvd is indeed only for European dvd players, good I have a multi-region player. But can not understand why amazon sells something in the US that can't be played back on 99% of the players sold here...or why Wishbone ash record label can't put a NTSC disc in the US market...weird.5 stars for the show, 0 star for the marketing strategy."
2,Slim pickings again,"I went ahead and invested in this follow-up to last year's ""Murder in Baker Street"", hoping that the stories would be better. Well, they weren't. The tales are just flat and unexciting. What happened to the good stories some of these authors used to contribute to previous anthologies? Out of this batch, maybe two are worth reading. Other than that, I would recommend saving $$ and renting it from the library."
2,"Well, nearly 10 years later...","I'm listening to this album for the first time in years. Theoretically I should love this because (a) It's surf rock played by girls, (b)They dress like monsters and (c) They cover Cheap Trick, but sadly it's mostly cornball. Some nice little Man or Astroman style instrumentals are ruined by the ""Woo-Hoos"" and ""Yeah Babys"" they shout over top. Don't buy."
3,Ed wood meets Dick Dale,"Say you're going to throw a horror movie themed cookout. It could happen. What are you going to play for music? Here's your answer. In The Night is far from a perfect album. Many of the songs are flat, it's about as corny as it gets and the musicianship is garage band all the way. But when it works, it works very well. On tracks like The Haunting of Planet Earth and Oui Monstre Oui, there's enough of a hook to hold your interest and the whole Surf/horror concept works quite well. If you're looking for SERIOUS music you're definitely looking in the wrong place. Go check out Tales from Topographic Oceans or A love Supreme. But if you're just looking for all out fun and have a thing for girls dressing up like rejects from a bad horror film- this will definitely hit the spot."
1,Pobre Produccion,"Disco editado originalmente en los anos 60s,grabado por Lissette junto a la Tuna Universitaria de Puerto Rico. Pobre calidad del sonido (aun en el cd reeditado). Muy por debajo de la calidad a la que Lissette nos tiene acostumbrados. Pobrisimo,no recomendado."
4,A good healthy snack,"A good healthy snack but the cherry one is a little sour, if you dont mind that then its for you"
4,"Good Story Idea, An Average Script, Great Acting","This is an example of a movie that has an average script but is saved by the acting. Not only Sissy Spacek, who can elevate any script, but also Art Carney and Jane Wyatt of TV's ""Father Knows Best"" fame make it a moving film experience. It could have been a self-pitying liberal mess but is actually a pretty good examination of what happened to make some American upper middle class white kids become America-hating anarchist bombers in the 1960s."
5,Great Book,I enjoyed this book very much. I felt it showed how tough immigrants had it in this country when they first arrived. I couldn't put this book down. It was a very good book. I highly recommend it.
3,"Creepy,Sexy,Cheesey & Disturbing All At The Same Time !","Ruggero Deodato's ""HOUSE ON THE EDGE OF THE PARK"" is a super softcore p(xxx)n thriller with good acting from most everybody in the film especially madman cult villain David Hess along with a fun little twist ending. This one deserves a spot on any genre collectors shelf. Perfect for a cold rainy day!"
2,A generous two stars....,"I felt the ending was totally implausible but then again, one has to look at the audience this film appeals to. Rather than dwell on the shortcomings or good points of the movie, if one likes this type of movie a better choice would be Blaise Moi which is equally or more so violent but pehaps more satisfying as to quality. A superior movie would be Butterfly Kiss along the lines of Thelma and Louise.For 'The House....' I really could not buy into the characters or their actions. For the special features, unless there is a change futher into the segment, the interview with the director is only in Italian, without subtitles. I found the DVD to be a disappointing movie. Not unexpectedly, it was over the top but underwhelming."
3,travel size,It would have been nice to know this was the travel size edition. I would have forked over the extra $3.00 for the normal size to start with. This one is handy but the other one is easier to reference. I just ordered the other one.this version is well suited for the catholic with limited space.
4,"Pekingese, A complete Pet Owner's Manual","I found the book especially helpful in their explanation as to why my Peke does some of the things he does. He is very independent, knows what commands mean, and doesn't always choose to follow them. He has always hated to be brushed but since reading the portion on how to brush him he has calmed some and allows brushing for short periods of time now. I was surprised to learn that Peke's do not transfer their loyality well. This is the third Peke we have owned and the only one we have gotten as a puppy. The other two were very loyal after a short period of time. One was an older dog which we knew was blind in one eye but learned later that he was blind in both eyes. He was an amazing dog as he went up and down stairs and ran free in the yard. Just don't move the furniture."
4,This is The Better One,"I bought almost all the Bolling suites on Vinyl years ago. I admire Bolling as a composer and historian, but as a fan of all Jazz forms I could never really decide whether these were like Time/Life intro books or great compositions. I'm still not sure, but I do like them. Anyway, I had a hankering to hear Hispanic Dance, couldn't get it out of my head, so I just bought all of the suites (again) on CD. This is the better version of the guitar suite, thanks primarily to George Shearing. His touch is lighter and more ""feathery"" whereas Bolling tends to hit the keys pretty hard. Plus, Ray Brown is hard to top. So if you need to pick one guitar suite over the other, choose this one."
1,More pleasure propaganda nonsense,"One of these days, someone will write a magnificently-defended and immaculately artful defense of sex as being disgusting, repulsive, hateful, depressing, and just plain ugly. Which, after all, is how it probably is to the majority of the people who don't even leave the lights on to see what's happening when they go through with it. Until then, well-intentioned but soft-headed and ultimately ephemeral books like this are only going to be able to show half the picture, no matter how many soft-focus shots or cutesy-pie ""poetic"" captions they use."
4,"nice item, poor packaging","The item received is as it was presented and was received in good condition. However, it was not wrapped as a new item, and packaging was poor. I would hesitate to order from this company again."
3,Dated material a problem,"I ordered this book to help me select books for our church library. When I first received this book, I was thrilled. The categories are helpful and the descriptions are accurate. I could hardly wait to get some of these gems on the shelves. Therein lies the problem. Many,many of these books are out of print and no longer available. Of the twelve biographies I tried to order, ten of them were out of print. Some of them were available used, but most were not. It was most disappointing!"
4,Awesome backpack,"I got this backpack for college and so far I love it. I can fit all my textbooks, laptop, and even my lunch! What I like most about it are the straps. I suggest spending a little bit more to get this backpack just because it's comfier than the other standard JanSports. I got the maroon colored one and the color is similar to the picture."
4,Great Shoes!,"Love these shoes! They run wide, so make sure you get the right width. I purchased one pair that I can't keep on, and waited too long to return them. These are a really comfortable 'dressy' shoe!"
5,Great service!,The shoes were excellent however were too large for me. I did have to return them and received a credit very efficiently.Thank you for your service.
3,Shoes,I have really enjoyed the Clarks Women's Metti Low Pumps. They are very comfortable and sassy. I've gotten lots of comments.
3,Chow Yun-Fat is wasted on this film,"Chow Yun-Fat is the coolest actor in Hollywood today, but his effort is wasted with an awful screenplay. Marky Mark is an ok actor, but don't mix him in with the big boys. Get ""The Replacement Killers"" instead for a far better Chow Yun-Fat American film."
2,What is the point?,"I read the Celestine Prophecy and enjoyed it and felt I had received some new insights that could help me. But this book, The Tenth Insight, left me totally bewildered. It is probably the most confusing book I have ever read. If you want to understand `soul families', Ramon Stevens in his Alexander books, does a much better and clearer job. Even as an adventure novel, the premise was weak and very distracting to the simple message of `figuring out why we are all here'. I've read the same sermon hundreds of times, all spoken more eloquently, all easier to understand."
2,"Rip Off, Questionable , not worth the money","The Celestine Prophecies was a something to think about and yes it opened some closed doors regarding the life old question ""What If"", but neither book can offer any concrete proof regarding its therory. Which leaves at that -only therory. I have much better things to do with my money and time then make someone else rich because of their therories."
4,Don't take it so seriously man - and trim your nose/ear hairs,"This one is going out to those uncertain about getting this CD as well as those who wrote the low ranking reviews who seem to take this CD (and themselves) too seriously. Boo Hoo I was alive in 1974 too, so the song must be about me as well (this song is actually not a very good RH song - there are far better songs here: I'm Only You, Glass Hotel, Freeze, Alright Yeah, The Wind Cries Mary...). The between song chatting ranges in humor, but so what?! If you don't like Hitchcock's thinking, of course you're not going to find what he says of any interest or content. This CD is not his strongest and not recommended for the newcomer (start with Black Snake Diamond Role, Fegmania, Invisible Hitchcock, Eye, and everything by the Soft Boys - all 10 out of 5 stars for me). When the time is right, you can give a hairless ear to this CD."
3,A different kind of romance,"I couldn't believe my luck when I picked this up at a Half Price Books for a dollar. And it's worth every penny of it and more. It's intriguing that you really don't want to put it down unless you really have to.I enjoyed reading as it is a change from the usual NR love stories. The part on Clare's subconscious mind keeps coming back to haunt her after all these years of supression and the vivid description of the rituals sends chills down my spine .The story may be a little predictable, with the hero saving his love. All in all, I enjoyed reading it."
4,Worth the time. Keeps you guessing.,"It is not only an intriguing story that keeps you interested all the way to the end, but the characters are very well developed. A very well written novel.I really enjoyed the book and will definitely try more from Roberts."
3,It is so so,I have read it years ago. I bought a new one for my sister. The storyline is okay but romance novels are just not for me.
5,It Will Keep You Guessing...,"This book will keep you guessing until the very end. I highly recommend it. Usually, I am pretty good at figuring out the end of a novel before it has finished..however, this book I didn't have a clue. It was well worth the wait."
1,Too Evil,"If I could give this book a - rating I would do so. Why in heavens name would Nora Roberts decide to write a mystery/romance novel and include satanism. I found the book way too disturbing from the first page. This is something Steven King would write, not Nora Roberts. If you buy this book expecting a romance/mystery forget it. The whole story line was not only disturbing, but just farfetched for me to enjoy."
2,Still a drag,"I bought this (for $5) for the just the 18th century pop tunes I thought it was filled with, no recitatives. No good tunes, no recitatives, no nothing. Just the one slow tune (soprano's) that everyone knows. I don't know what it's called and I don't care. But I gave it a star. And $5 + shipping. Mozart could write pretty tunes for the voice, but he didn't write any in his operas!"
5,Just what I was looking for,"This box is large and nicely made. Outside measurements are 7 3/8""W x 5 7/16""H x 6 7/8""D. Inside, the compartment is 4 13/16"" deep, so it holds more recipes than most boxes. Lip on lid is awkward. Directions say ""lid swings open to the front to serve as a convenient recipe card holder."" This requires either turning box around after opening or opening and filing recipes in the box backward to the usual way. I do not plan to use this feature. Old dog! Otherwise perfect!"
2,Snooze-fest....,"""Effects"" is a better idea than it is a movie. The first hour is a group of people rambling about making a horror movie with a lot of drug-use, and nothing really happens except snippets of voyeurism that isn't scary or intersting.The final half hour picks up, but it's predictable. Not a gory movie, but instead a psychological one. If the pacing was better and more events happened in the movie before the final ten minutes, ""Effects"" would've been enjoyable, but it was too BORING for me to ever watch again.Curiousity killed me on this one."
5,Resounding Silence,"Bloc Party is without doubt the best new band of 2005. I bought their album back in March after hearing Pioneers playing at Virgin on Sunset. The music is seductive, funky, and if I dare say, timeless.The lyrics range from melancholic to enigmatic to down right funny. I love the tenacity of Pioneers and the sobriety of Plans--two of my favorite tracks on this album.What I love most about this album is its enduring relevance. I've been listening to it on and off for 12 months now and not one song got stale or tired. That is a sign of a timeless classic.Sonically, Bloc Party is Franz Ferdinand on Ritalin. They are much more mature and consistently coherent. Lyrically, they are much more adventures and interesting than most bands out there. For a new band, they definitely hit the jackpot with Silent Alarm, which is anything but silent, and the ""alarm"" is very apt considering how huge this band will be in the very near future.If you don't have it yet, get it...now!"
2,Why do we need such a band,"You are making rock music, right? No melody No rhythm No hook No idea No creativity. Or you guys are trying to apply some experimental spell just to make it more boring? If this kind of bands are the future of rock, I will exile myself to an tropical island with food and all the classic albums from the last century. They are even more useless than Maroon 5 or Nickelbank, which at least could write sth. to make you remember for about one week with the help of airwave. I really don't know why should we blame those poprock or rockpop talentless drones if our self-seeking rock savior-wannabes make few albums in this 5 years that could be remembered for another 5 years. However, it is not so unbelievable when Coldplay is the on-stage hero, Modest Mouse is the underground hero and U2 is the goddamnfather. What a shame. I give 2 stars for their efforts to make their music more complex and tedious."
3,Alarm Bells Ring,"While this album isn't that bad, it isn't that good either. It does not have ant stand out tracks and i feel that perhaps people should tread carefully before buying it.It is hyped as being a document that is unique and original, but I personally believe that if this kind of music is what you want to buy, then perhaps you would be better off buying something by Interpol. I would recommend ""Turn on the Bright Light."""
4,Time Capsule of a lost era,"Orient Express is a time capsule. It was written in the early 1930s and, as such, captures the world of the inter-war period in continental Europe. The book's strengths and weaknesses spring from this perspective. The strength are that Greene shows us a world that was rather bleak and yet vibrant. The downside is that anti-Semitism and class-based prejudices are evident both in the character's and in Greene's attitudes. However, as a time capsule of a lost era, this book is worth reading."
4,If you like Mest already this album is fine.,"Ok, so a lot of other reviewers complained about this being a big let down. I'll admit that this album is not as good as their past ones, and if this is the first time I had heard the band I wouldn't like them near as much. But the album is catchy pop punk. There are some songs that beg to be sung along to in the car and some fun songs that had me bobbing my head.Yes the album is dark, but MEST has always had dark issues with their songs...(think Drawigng Board, f*** up kid, mother's prayer, etc...) That hasn't changed on this album, it just seems like they are trying to take the ""dark"" more seriously instead of making jokes out of it.Like I said this isn't as good as the last 3 Mest Albums in my opinion. But if these songs had been intermixed with songs off of those albums, you'd never know the difference."
5,Holy Moley,"This album is so great I am at a loss for words. Mest never fail to impress me with their music. I'd give this rating a perfect 100 but there aren't that many stars!!Definately get this album, it's so great, it gets my windows rocking at the volume I play it at. Lol.MEST IS THE BEST!!"
3,5 stars for the dvd 1 for the cd,I love mest earlier albums and usually found myself listening more to tony material. But on this album I only found 3 songs I like and they are all jere. I like dark music but i prefer the old happy fun mest. I think the only reason I like those songs is it reminds of halloween and that is near. I probaly would of not bought the album if I knew what was actually on it. I do however think the dvd is worth it. Its absolutely hillarious.
5,"Very good , but worst CD of MEST","Take me Away (Cried out to Heaven)- 9/10 Very good ska song, good lyrics, good openerKiss me Kill me - 9/10 Good Jeremiah song with goood lyrics, a singlePhotographs- 8/10 Yes, not a great song, still goodCursed- 10/10 The first time I heard this, i didn't stop to play it.As his Black Heart Dies (My Mistake)- 10/10 Awesome chorus, good lyricsThis Time- 7/10 Second Worst song of the album, slowGraveyard- 10/10 Excellent songs in this album? Yes, Graveyard it isNightmare- 9/10 Good lyrics and chorus, a great songCan't take this- 8/10 Other ballad, but it's not bad as This TimeDying for You- 6/10 Worst song of the CD, good opener, the other things are badTonight Will Last Forever- 8/10 Good song but some repetitiveLast Kiss- 9/10 A good ending, chorus and all is great about this song, but not is excellent"
3,"Smells like ""Good Charlotte"" Spirit","I am a dedicated mest fan, owning every album from their self released mo money mo fortys to present ""photographs"", and being such a fan, i have to say im a bit disappointed with this album compared to each of their last albums. It was those albums that made me fall absolutely in love with them. ""Wasting time"" and ""destination unknown"" were soooo awesome! you can hear a transition from ""destination unknown"" to ""mest"" and now that same transition continues deeper into ""photographs"". the best songs to listen to are 'take me away', 'kiss me kill me', 'dying for you', and 'graveyard'. Everything has a new sound. if you support mest like i do, pick up the album. if you're looking for the best pop-punk that your used to hearing from mest, you may want to skip this album this time around. I think we have a new good charlotte in the making, but whatever, i guess they deserve to explode, since ""wasted"" never caught on (WHO KNOWS WHY??)"
5,Invaluable tool for writing,"This is an invaluable tool for writing military perforance evaluation reports. The book's best use is as a memory jogger to pick out those phrases which I can then expand upon. Better yet, it keeps me writing in current tense, instead of past tense.It saved about 5 hours while writing the last one."
4,The Other Way,"If you are looking for a novel that examines our beliefs in God and the Universe, you have come to the right place. I found this book to be very thought producing.It's main characters are well developed and you will find yourself involved in their personal dilemmas. At times you will find yourself liking them, loving them, or even hating them. It is easy to read and carries you swifly from page one to the end. After finishing this book, I am sure you will want to return to examine the pages all over again! If you, like me, are looking for ways to help you understand your own thoughts and views about God and our reasons for being here, you will find it in this excellent novel by Lloyd H. Whitling."
3,What's The Zone???,"Much better than her last album, but still lacking. The best song is the Madonna duet, though we could have stood to hear more Madonna and less Britney. But really I must know, what is The Zone and why is she so desperate to get into it???"
4,muzik 2 groove 2,"Excellent dance tracks. Well put together. Interesting collaborations.Tracks 2 mention: Toxic, Breathe On Me, (I Got That) Boom Boom, and of course Me Against The Music"
5,"BEST ALBUM, LIKE THE PREVIOUS ONES!!!!","First of all, those people at the bottom critizing Britney and saying all bad things about her are just dumb and stupid people, who probably don't have a job and all they do is just critized the best celebrities. OK, now that I said that, I believe that this album is the one of the best, like all the other albums Britney has made. It has a very good toone, all the tracks are just perfect. They really show how Britney has grown since the last 5 years. All tracks are my favorite, specially TOXIC, which was #1 for many weeks, didn't want to leave that spot :). So all those people who all they do is say crap about Britney are crazy and should get a better job. Is not like Britney is gonna listen to them. Down with you, all you Britney haters. ************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************"
1,"C'mon... her initials are B.S., so what can you expect...","But B.S. from her ""music *lol* !Britney blows. You know it, I know it, and the world knows it! She's the Vanilla Ice of pop. Why isn't she a has-been like him by now, I'll never know? Oh wait, I do know...She barely wears any clothes, that's why.OK, granted she's ok-looking, so she's not a complete waste of space as a human being. That's what the 1 star is for. *lol*The End. 'Nuff said.P.S.Customers who bought these also bought...Kidz Bop and Barney's Greatest Hits. HA HA!"
4,AWESOME!!,"Britney has really pumped up this album wit some hip hop stuff, but she still is no where near bein as good as singer Christina Aguilera. My two favorites are- Toxic and Me against the music. Go buy this CD. It is really worth it."
4,First Time Listener,"I'd never bought a Britney album before and I honestly don't know what inspired me to buy this one. Reasons not-withstanding however, this album is actually pretty good. True, Britney's singing voice isn't amazing but it's far from bad. I'm not a big fan of her hip-hop influenced tracks but her 'techno' tracks are quite good. If you can find this album for a deal and aren't an elitest fan-boy of music (yeah, all you negative posters), then you should enjoy this album for what it is, a pop-album."
4,Different - but good!,"When I bought this cd I expected the typical Britney Sound. But - I was surprised - she made a totally different kind of music. It is kind of dance music mixed with pop. The song 'Breathe on me' remembers me of the Australian singer Kylie Minogue. Britney fans will be surprised, but hopefully in a good way!"
1,Pre-Packaged Garbage,"Garbage, Garbage, Garbage, Garbage, Garbage, Garbage, Garbage, Garbage, Hack, Hack, Hack, Hack, Hack..........etc.."
1,Not the same Britney.,"I think this album is horrible. In an effort to sound ""more grown up,"" she has filled her album with songs about sexual topics that I don't care to go into. Instead, she just comes across sleezy and lacking in talent. I used to be a fan of hers but not anymore, not since she changed her whole style and came out with this aweful album. I don't even like most of the songs on it. Some of them are pretty strange, too. I really like ""Everytime,"" though, which sounds more like the Britney I used to know and love, and is very pretty. But I can't handle the other stuff, and I was especially appalled by the song ""Touch of My Hand."" (And then she even pretended to act it out on stage while she sang it on her tour!) Wow. And to think I saw this album being sold at Toys R' Us one day... this isn't a CD I think the little kiddies should hear. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,Even her die hard fans arent confident about in the zone.,Check out Go Britney.com or the countless other Britney sites and you will see even her DIE HARD fans are questioning the longevity of this girl.They vote obsessively at TRL and music sites from around the globe to 'help' her.They are worried that this new CD isnt selling well.I have enjoyed watching her actual fans and new fans alike discuss Britney because they will let you know what the TRUTH is about her with their worries and concerns and compulsion to VOTE over and over again for BRITNEY in the polls!!Lets Help her out!!!I think that we may be getting an break from this puppet and her record label in the coming years.I truly hope this manufactured Pop fake Girl/Boy band genre of music will stop flooding our airwaves.
1,Is she singing at all?,"I used to be a Britney fan until I heard this C.D. For one, it sounds just like all of her other music except with better beats. But other than that...this C.D. is just not worth buying. I bought it and listened to it about 5 times and now its getting dusty on my C.D. rack. It seems as if she has something to prove on this C.D. by talking about sex and partying and drinking. That's fine and all but a whole album based on those 3 things....gets kind of old. We know you've grown up but do you have to talk about it on every single song? Her voice sounds very diluted with all the beats in the background which is pretty much all she has going for her. This album is a cry for acceptance as an artist when all it seems to be is another Britney Inc. album...showcasing her lack of talent and artistry. The only song that I think is worth listening to is Toxic...but once again, its the beat thats catchy not her voice."
1,Really a very boring CD,"As a self professed fan of pop music, I was really excited about this CD. Unfortunately it's really a warm overed disappointment...just see the terrible ""Me Against the Music"" for proof. Apparently, the music lost big time as Britney moves further away from what she actually does very well...fun catchy pop...this album simpers and snears and comes off laughable and pathetic instead of sexy and mature...for a better listening experience try Britney's earlier efforts or the latest efforts by Kylie Minogue or Paulina Rubio."
4,Britney's best and worst,"The best part about this album is that it's nothing like Britney Spears.It has R&B beats, hip hop and dance. This album should have gotten a lot of credit because it's a hell of a lot better than Oops!...I Did It Again.The worst part of this album is her voice. I know she's NEVER going to sound like Christina, but atleast she could TRY! Britney is a talented singer even if she doesn't have ""the voice"". Well, neither does Jennifer Lopez Know how to sing properly but you don't see anyone hatin' on that bitch now do you.I give this album 4 stars because it could have been better if her voice REALLY matured."
5,THe Best,"Look, ive been a fan since the beginning but this album is totally different. It's so grown up and mature but yet fun and exciting. Its her best album and let me say maybe the best album of the year. ""toxic"" is the best and ""the hook up"" is close behind. Definitely worth buying trust me.ITS GOOOD!"
5,Anti-Britney Fans will like it...,"Britney Spears' new CD is definately for those that love her or for those that never really cared for her. The new CD is filled with club music and heavty beats. Those that dismissed Britney as just bubble gum pop will be surprised, check out ""Boom Boom"" or ""Toxic"". The stand out song on the album is ""Breathe on me"" listen to it and see what I mean. For those never interested in Britney will add this disk to their collection, it is a club/dance cd, reminiscent of Janet Jackson's ""janet."" Enjoy..."
2,Download In the Zone from iTunes,"I've always been a Britney fan, but this CD, especially coming after Christina Aguilera's Stripped CD, falls flat. Her voice is treated with special effects, even more so than her previous albums. And, usually you can get past her average voice to enjoy the poppy songs as a guilty pleasure. But, the only song that is good on this album is the single ""In the Zone."" The rest is mediocre at best. I would download ""In the Zone"" from iTunes, listen to see if there is another song on the album you would like to add to your collection, and save the $$ to buy something else more worthwile on Amazon."
1,got AN ear infection get brintey!,I listened to a few song samples enough for me Yikes!Her voice reminds of boys who used to scrap their nails on the chalkboard. Horrible. she has no talent shes just a silicon makeup factory with some clairlol added.If you want to clean out your ears from an ear infection or torture saddam hussein this is for you send a copy to the president. but please be warned do not I reapeat do not try to listen to it any other you way. It might make your head explode!I recommend something anything else please trun the page.
1,Stinks!,"This album really doesn't do the trick man! Foul, disgusting, and really devoid of substance, ""In THe Zone"" continues the stream of dreck that we've been subjected to for the last five years! Don't buy this. If you agree, vote yes, if not, vote no."
1,"Brit sucks, Xtina rules!","Why most of America continuely compares Chritina Aguilera and Britney Spears baffles me. While Britney continues to come out with songs that have recycled lyrics that could have been written by a 8 yr old, Christina continues to shine with touching songs, catchy tunes, and an all around beautiful voice. If you have ever heard the Kidz-Bop version of ""Toxic"", I'm sure you can agree with me that when compared to the way Britney sings it, the Kidz-Bop kids sound exactly the same, if not better. So in conclusion, the only way you should be able to compare a true superstar like Christina Aguilera, and a wanna-be like Britney Spears is as Mouseketeers."
2,Very good songs accompanied by a very bad voice,"I know I'll be using a regular cliché by saying this, but this album is the epiphany of the fact Britney has absolutely no vocal power whatsoever. I have bought this album together with Christina's ""Striped"" and the difference is so overwhelming that I find no words to explain it.Britney just keeps on meowing and purring throughout the CD and the only saving grace of this album are the excellent background sound effects.""Me Against the Music"" seems so nice only because she takes refuge behind Madonna's and other background voices, otherwise you could have a glimpse of how absurd her voice really sounds in this CD.Anyway, I will not rush and say this is the beginning of Britney's decay, for great voices have disappeared into oblivion while other not so great voices prevailed, like Madonna's example. Let us wait and see what cards she still has to play (and by the way, she will have to do much better than that wedding gig)."
1,What The...,"Wow, OK I'll be the first to admit that I liked the song Baby One More Time, it was catchy, and it was before Britney Spears became Britney Spears(tm). I knew she couldn't sing but at least the songs were somewhat upbeat, something you could listen to without having to think, which is good sometimes. Now this CD is released, and I'm not even sure there's singing on it. They pump the music up so loud to cover her inferior voice, they modulate her voice electronically to make her sound more ""adult"", and then her panting to really make the 14 year old boys crazy. This CD will be a huge seller I'm first and she'll probably go on to slaughter a couple more records before we can finally start talking about her in the terms we should be: a Tiffany-clone."
1,Britney needs some music lessons and to grow UP!!!!!!!!!!,"If Britney take hours and hours of music lessons and learn what real music is about, maybe she can become a better singer. In my view she is using her looks too atract lost TEENS. So bad that singers like Britney and like Madonna (That one is old already) brain wash TEENS minds to buy their imature CDs. My sister bought this CD and now she don't know what to do with this. She told me that this CD is terrible. I have an advice for Britney: GROW UP!!!!!"
1,Pure Garbage and nonsense,The first single with leather faced Madonna failed. This CD is pure garbage. It will not even appeal to the low IQed masses.
2,Learn how to sing,I think this princess need to learn how to sing. she uses techno intruments to back up her awful voice. me against the music is the only good song and that isn't even that good. please do yourself a favor pick christina over britney!
2,"Not Quite What I Was Expecting, A Bit Of A Let Down","I have not actually gone out and purchased this CD, rather I listened to the snippets on her webpage while I was trying to decide whether or not to purchase it and I've decided not to. This album reminds me a lot of Madonna's Erotica album, one that I have but I don't enjoy that much. This album, however, I was quite disappointed by what I heard on it. The songs don't seem to have much substance and I found myself annoyed by some of them. The only ones I can actually say have any holding power would be the Kylie Minogue flavored ""Breathe On Me"" and the balladry ""Everytime"" as well as the chart hit ""Me Against The Music"". For a fan of nothing more than the music, this album was a real disappointment and will be lucky if I change my mind and add it to the other three on my shelf. I've given it 2 stars just to signify the only songs that are worthwhile. Sorry Britney...."
3,Not too shabby!,"This is my first Britney cd. I wasn't extremely impressed, but overall it wasn't a horrible purchase. Overall I'd say about half of the songs on the album are worth listening too. The ones that weren't were just really really really bad! No in between. My advice for this cd is that it's worth listening too, ..."
1,BRITNEY FUMBLES!!,Exactly what ZONE is Britney supposed to be in?? Sure ain't music. She can't sing. The band music is so terrific and funky it's a shame it's ruined by Britney Spears voice. The only ZONE Britney is in now is the TWILIGHT ZONE.
2,Pretty poor,"Britney spears proves to us in this album just how weak of an vocalist she is, and that this album is pretty pointless and to be blunt, bad.1.Theres only a few catchy songs(Toxic, Outrages and Hook up and thats it!).2.All songs except for 2 Are sex based, sex based songs are good, but Britneys immature vocals and the very weak writing makes it bad, you'll laugh at the writing, horrible.3.She expresses no strong vocals at all, in ""Everytime"" she does sound alright, but still weak, so you can imagin how all the album is(weak vocals, computerised alot etc).Verdict:2/5Do NOT buy this album!it's worthless with only 3 good songs, I suggest you buy Christina Aguilera-""Stripped"" or Mariah Carey-""Greatist hits"", now them two musicans have great vocals and great songs, get there albums and don't waste you're time on Britney."
2,its okay. . thats just my opinion though,"im not really a britney spears fan, i mean y should i HATE her, u know? n e way, my brother got this cd cuz he is a britney kinda fan, he listens to it all the time, but i just dont really like it much toxic was okay, but it (to me) it gets REALLY annoying, they play it on the radio all the time. okay lemme tell the truth: I HATE THIS CD ALOT. but i dont want to offend britney fans, i would reccomend this to n e britney fan though (DUH!) i really dislike her, mostly cuz she babytalks when she sings all the time. i mean the song shadow, she sounds okay, but could sound a bit better. i really dont like her, but it is worth buying this with ur money anyway.-anonymous"
5,How does Britney keep doing it again?,Britney is without a doubt the best performer in the world and this new CD illustrates how she has adapted to show how she and her music are maturing. She changes tempo and style in each different track to offer something for everyone. This is her best since OOPS!. Definately worth buying. Listen and you will become adicted to it.
4,Coming Back,"Britney Spears took a ""short"" six month break from making music. When she came back she immediatly got back in the game! This CD is one of her best, in my opinion. She jumped back in and created music that is some of the hippest today. She ""got with it"" very fast. Her first single ""Me Against the Music"" made great success, and her newest one ""Toxic"" will probably be a smash hit. I highly recommend this album!"
2,Below average,some of the production is good most of it is pretty dull and trite. Her singing? Non existent...its more electronica than a musician slash vocalist - britney will sell becuaseh er image selss simple - why even bother argueing those merits...she has a a whole brigade of brainwashed kids who want to worship someone and they have found a willing idol. On average its better than her first three albums - however thats not saying much there is no breakaway single in this set. The best song is toxic and its not that great - its an average track -----I listened to all the tracks and was not smitten with a single track - I suggest Outkast - now that album I instanteously loved - an album shouldnt HAVE TO grow on you - but even then In the zone wont hold you for that long - GET OUTKAST!!!!!!!! that album is eclectic and amzing!
4,Brave new CD,"Venturing in a new direction Britney has shed the cookie cutter pop monotony for a more diverse sound. Granted her vocals are enhanced and half of her tracks feature artist supplementation, she actually pulls off this CD well. I've been a fan of Britney as a ""performer"" and would be curious as to how she'd perform these tracks live. Don't get me wrong - she makes each song her own. It's the most creative album from her yet...I loved the slower song ""Shadow"", the danceable ""Toxic"", ""Outrageous"", and the remix of ""Me Against the Music"". I think it's worth a listen - even if the lyrics seem ""corny"" they're catchy."
4,Better than expected!,"I just listened to ""In the Zone"" for the first time and I cannot stop dancing. Britney sounds better than in her previous effort ""Britney"". All the tunes are very catchy and great to move to. This CD is definetly a different Britney Spears than what we are used to! She has reinvented herself again!"
1,horrible!!!,"first I have to say this, I have actually listened to this album, unlike most people who hate britney. Why are people still buying her crappy music, she seriously sounds like a stripper whispering, how can someone like this be past other people on the billboards, like say people who have talent or actually play music, and also just because she gets a song credit does not mean she wrote the song, you can get a song credit for writing a couple of words. So to people who actualy like Britney go out and buy good music, because in a few years you will ask youself why did I ever buy this crap?"
5,The Best Album Ever Released!,Seriously! This album is the best! Other albums (including other artists) always contain at least 1 song that I don't like but In The Zone's every song is my favourite! I bought this album (regular CD) 2 years ago and now I'm buying it again because I love it soo much and I can't wait for the DVD side!This is not on the Amazon's tracklisting but I just wanna let you know that the DVD side also includes the ENTIRE album in DOLBY 5.1! I can proove it to you! It says on the back cover and I can give you the screen cap of the menu where you can choose to hear the album in Dolby 5.1!! So you can enjoy the entire album on the DVD side in PCM Stereo and Dolby 5.1!!
3,one of her better efforts,"I don't even like britney spears. She ruined her voice with too much smoking and she's an attention seeking publicity queen. I did however listen to this album and I have to admit she tried something new on this album, even if that means working with producers other than max martin. R Kelly produced Outrageous, the song Touch of My Hand, Everytime and Shadow(which should have been given to someone else) were well written and produced, and the songs Me Against the Music feat. Queen Maddy and Toxic with it's electronica inspired beat(gee I wonder if she got that from Madonna) were also good choices for singles. I don't see her lasting longer and she may be well past her prime as we speak now, but do check out the songs mentioned because they were well written for her, even if her voice didn't match often."
2,"I love ya Brit, but this is just too much...","I'm 16, and hot, without having to look like Britney, I'm a Mexican Britney Spears, and just like Brit, I can't sing either(too bad I don't have a computer that will make my voice sound decent liek Brit). I liked her last 2 cd's, but this is a little too commercial and kinky! I'll take Hilary Duff's new cd anyday..."
4,I am so in the zone!!!!!,"The best from Briney ever...My favorite tracks are 1,2,3,5,6,8 and 9. Ok trax are 4,7,10 and 13, wack trax are 11 and 12. all in all a good cd."
2,eehh,"Everyone knows that out of all the pop divas Britney is the least talented. In my opion she would have been a better stripper than a singer...but unfortunaltly she's hot so therfore she can do whatever she wants. I like the song toxic. It is the only one i like. The rest well it sux it lacks origanlity, she sounds just like the rest of the world there is nothing about britney spreas that is unique. to be a good musican you have to know what reality is and she doesnt she was born and raised as a child star. But hey whatever floats your boat"
1,She's just about as worthless as they come,"It makes me sick that Britney Spears is considered a musician at all. She's horrible, can't sing to save her life, and all she has going for her is a great body and famous friends. We should boot her out of her exalted position and put someone there who actually has talent and deserves it!"
1,More pop rubbish,"Pop music is such a stale genre how can you listen to this ?. You don't need to buy this album(why would you?) because you eventulally here every song on MTV repeated no less than 20 times a day.Every song sounds the same and lyrically the content is repetitive and not diverse.What you need is Superunknown, Soundgarden rocks.... daaa Whose Soundgarden?"
5,"Britney is ""In The Zone"" with this album","Okay, so Britney doesn't have the most beautiful voice on the planet, but she knows what beats and sounds mix well with it. Out of the four albums that she has put out so far, this is clearly her best one. Although the lyrics aren't deep and profound, most of the songs on here are pretty upbeat and get your head bobbin'. Her new album is all about letting loose and just having FUN! And if people can't appreciate the fact that music should also have this kind of affect on people, then obviously this album is not for them. But if you are, then you should definitely get this album! If you're stuck in traffic, doing some chores around the house, or even working out, then start playing this CD because time will fly by a lot faster with this new album. And don't forget to put it on repeat! =0)"
1,"As usual, no voice, no substance, but more sex.","I expected a mature, grown up Britney with this album, but WOW I was wrong...The album is TOOO ""samey"", and it's still bubble gum pop...She's yet to establish herself as a grown up artist...Why is it so hard for her? In a nutshell, this is just another Britney album."
1,buy something else!,"this cd sucks. i used 2 like britney's music, but every 1 of her cds has gotten worse. she shouldn't even get credit for singing these songs because it's not her voice. it's all synthesized crap. the only thing britney spears has going for her is hype, her looks, and dancing ability. if u want a pop cd with some substance buy christina aguilera's stripped album. now that girl can sing! she writes her own songs too."
3,a better effort,"many of the songs are the best britney has done in her career and she tries different styles of music, but at the end of the day you have to give the songwriters credit cause they've done a fabulous job and her voice her still horrible. Stick to madonna and janet, the pop queens who do it way better"
1,"Yeah, she's toxic... she makes me puke","""The best thing about being an artist is that you get to travel overseas to places like Canada."" ~Britney SpearsI'm sorry, but this piece of trash pop star is too stupid to take seriously. The only reason she's gotten anywhere is because she's hot, not because she's talented.And you can go ahead and click ""no"" where it asks if this review helped you. I honestly don't care. I just need to warn all the people who want to hear some real music. There is no real music here. It is overprocessed bubblegum pop. The end!"
1,How can it be??!!!,"How can it be that this untalented singer keep fooling people for so many years? She can't even sing live properly, relying to playbacks most of the time. And she proved tobe a smart girl with that ""spontaneous"" kiss Madonna gave her...BRitney is a marketing phenomenon made by clever businessmen who did not imagine that their ""project"" would sell so well.This new album is useless like all her other albums. Go on, buy it and make her richier and richier without even knowing how to sing."
2,Britney is hot...and that's all she has got.,"The production was top-notch, the songs all sounded different. But that is where the positives start and end. Let me say first; I consider myself a reasonable man, But I seriously cannot understand why anyone would like this album. It's filtered, completely lifeless and the lyrics are meaningless. You can search and search for different reasons to justify this album, I know I did, but it's as hopeless as her movie career. Just because I used that analogy doesn't mean I hate Britney. Her other albums were decent pop albums. But this one just stunk it up bad.Dont buy this album."
2,Something worth listening to...not.,"Alright, everything on this is complete junk EXCEPT EVERYTIME, my god thats a good song. i listen to the cure and christian death and marilyn manson and i like that song. lyrically its amazing, and the video is also pretty deep. i wouldnt buy the cd for that one song, but id definitely download it within seconds of hearing it. which i did."
4,The production is the star,"Not known for her singing ability, this CD still showcases other industry people who prove that they know what they're doing. The CD is catchy, fun and energetic. I'm a fan of Brit's, but not a delusional one..I know her limits (and can hear them), but the overall work is still pretty good. Besides, I got it for $13...for sure worth it!"
1,The Worst Singer in Music History,"The Hot Beats are the only things interesting then this horrible pathetic excuse of an album, britney still cannot sing as madonna can, the writing is horrible, and the title should be called out the zone instead this, What a horriblethis album belongs with g-unit's beg for mercy and metallica's st. anger as the worst album of the year."
4,all grown up & sexin' it up,"IN THE ZONE is a world away from her first cd BABY ONE MORE TIME and she has done a great job adopting new sounds...if you are a die-hard bubble-gum pop fan, then this cd will probably be a rude awakening...but for those like me who are growing up w/ britney...she hits the spot w/ ""early mornin,"" the sexy reggae beat in ""the hook up,"" and the hot hip hop sound in ""I've got that boom boom."" MY FAVORITE BRITNEY ALBUM YET!"
1,In the zone alright,"...The Twilight Zone. I've got a cat and if you step on her tail (by accident of course) she sounds better than this no-talent Spears.God, what crap!"
1,Ugh!,I bought 3 of her albums. Yes she can sing but she is not using all of her vocal abilities at all! Its all about image and shockery. I think the reason why her latest album has gone bad isbecause she has been making some real stupid decisions and perhaps has pushed aside those who were being protective of her as well as their counsel-perhaps her parents. The MTV kiss so grossed me out and saddened me that I broke all of the CD's I have ever bought of her. She really does not care about her base fans and I don't see the need for her to be continually slutty.I am sure that most that buy her albums are men. I am not surprised that her albums do not sound like music. The music has stopped after her3rd CD.
1,same old pop crap,"Britney Spears is a pop idol... what has music become? We all know that Jive Records employs other people to write hit songs, with the aim of making money off the record...what does Britney Spears get? --More money. Britney Spears exemplifies how superficial and empty music has become. Listen to real, honest music, not what ""corporations"" want you to buy."

3,better then the rest...,"well this cd finnaly had a differnt feel to it compared to her other albu,bs, ya she cant realy sing but the beats are pretty cool, def. music you cna dance to and get ya energetic"
3,C+ For Effort,"Her CD's are definately getting better each time, but the same thing still remains... her voice will never life up to Christina Aguilera. What a waste of a nice dance beat. This CD only has 2 good songs. Trust me, I wouldn't pay full price for this. I would buy it used or get if off ebay."
2,If this is the metamorphosis....go back to the cocoon,"Ok, I'll admit that I am a 22 year old closet Britney fan. Her music is typically ""upbeat dance at the club"" music. And while I enjoy ""Me Against The Music"" and ""Toxic,"" I can't say much for the other dance tracks. I do enjoy the ballad ""Everytime,"" but there is little I can say that is positive about this album. Britney is still great as a person, but her attempt to transition her music isn't as successful as her former beau Justin Timberlake's. Hopefully this album is not her final transition as far as her music goes.:) Gretchen"
5,Worth a try,"I really don't think the music samples can help you make a decision here. If you are a pop fan, you must give it a try and give it a couple of listens.I was listening to her first album a couple of days ago and I have to admit, she has improved so much. Her lyrics aren't very amazing or anything in 'In the Zone' but still much better than stuff that went 'I was born to make you happy', 'E-mail my heart' or 'Soda pop'. She sounds so much better too. I do agree her voice isn't very pleasant but I don't think you'll mind it very much on this CD.There are some great hot sexy numbers in there and worth a try..."
1,She Doesn't Know How To Sing !,"This album is poor, because she doesn't know how to sing. If she would sing like Shakira or Christina Aguilera this would be perfect. She doesn't sing, she's talking. When she was a little girl, she sang better. I like her second, and third album, but not this one."
2,STINKER,WHAT WAS SHE THINKING ... YEAH SHE CAN DANCE BUT SHE CAN'T SING A NOTE. THIS ABLUM WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT. SHE TRIED TO BE LIKE MADONNA TOO MUCH AND IT HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE. FIND YOUR OWN IDENTITY. IF I HAD THE CHOICE OR SEEING OR MEETING BRITNEY OR CHRISTINA..... I'D SEE CHRISTINA BECAUSE SHE CAN SING AND SHE HAS THE TALENT. YEAH SHE MAYBE SEXY AND OVER THE TOP BUT SHE HAS THE VOICE AND THE MOVES TO BE THAT WAY.
1,WHO TOLD HER SHE CAN SING!!,"you people who are ""Britney Fans"" i feel so so sorry for you!who in the world told her she could sing!! i mean i only liked her albums 1+2and a lil bit of 3 but num.#4 is AWFUL!! she sounds like she' sick and crying! but i do admit ""Everytime"" is good the rest are just awful!! i like the nice 16,18 softer image of Britney now she acts like a ___<?>____!!!!! uh!im done!"
3,Buyer Beware...,Warning this dual disc does not have a MLP / DVD-Audio 5.1 track. It only has a Dolby Digital 5.1 & 2 channel PCM stereo audio track. Buy as an educated consumer.
3,Tinny and at times half-baked,"From the Fall's house/dance period, which produced some amazing tracks that are must-haves, but also a certain amount of filler, weaker tracks, songs without distinction, some cliches, and it's too bad as well that the production is just so tepid. I look at Shift-Work and Code:Selfish as transitional albums. From the Brix 80s fallout, and the very strong if uneven Extricate album, they link to the solid Infotainment Scan of 1993, and then to Middle Class Revolt, which has some of the highest high points of this period. I can think of maybe three tracks on Code:Selfish that are really indispensable. But you might as well get it because you'll enjoy it, and Mark E Smith is admirable even on albums like this. He doesn't play memory-lane hits, always looks forward, tries and sometimes fails, and embarrasses most of his generation just by example."
1,nutri vet dog biscuits - 20 pound box,"I am very disappointed in Amazon with this purchase. Although I purchased a 20 pound box, I only received 18 pounds? Even the shipper listed the weight at 18 pounds. Is Amazon now into false advertising?"
4,younger dogs love them,"My two younger, three year old dogs absolutely love these and it is much easier to get them to take than the pills. My eight year old however, can't chew them because they are hard on his teeth. I have to break them up into much smaller pieces for him to eat. Great value for the money. I would recommend them to other dog owners."
3,"Broken pieces, some dogs don't like them","About 80% of the biscuits were broken, clearly not the cause of shipping since the box is strong and undamaged. Some of our dogs eat them, others won't. Considering they all like to browse the kitty litter, that's saying a lot. I'll probably switch back to the treat version made by another brand. The expiration date was fairly close at 04/10, though not a problem. I purchased two boxes.3 stars, one less for too many broken biscuits, another for some dogs preferring kitty cat 'tootsie rolls' over these biscuits."
1,"Fear Factor ""game"" is pure garbage - UNPLAYABLE!","""spinner"" - won't spin more than 1/4 around. Rules - a 5 year old could have done better. Candy won't mix. Smasher broke on first try (cracked - cheap plastic). Alternate rules (get this): ""Fear Factor Trivia: Make up your own questions and give points for right answers, eat for wrong answers"". Granted, the candy is supposed to be gross, but it's absolutely unusable (nothing at all mixes). This is the first review I've ever written on a toy but it's so terrible, I just had to get on line to warn everyone. Terrible product - worst I've seen in years!!!"
3,A fantasy adventure of a young heroine on a quest,"This book is an interesting fantasy adventure but a little bit slow going at times. The young heroine survives many perils including a quest to retrieve a magic shard. This is really like two novels. It takes the first half of the book to create a situation which launches her on the quest, most of the second half to cover the quest, and has a short, after-the-quest ending which can be pretty much anticipated. The authors seem to be a little casual of disposing of various groups of men in the tale, and women would probably like the book better than men."
3,Kind of a letdown,"I'm not a big fan of collaborations - they never seem to be as good as what either author can do by him/herself. And this book is no exception. I've seen much better from both Lackey and Anthony. OK, I agree, I have read much worse fantasy than this, but I expected better from authors of their caliber. I also found Anthony's Author's Note particularly obnoxious - he describes how he basically had Lackey write a book on his idea, then finished it off by adding a beginning and ending and polishing it to his usual standards. But it's NOT up to his usual standards. Stick with either author by him/herself, you'll enjoy the reading a lot more."
4,Dont judge a book by its structure,"If I Pay Thee Not In Gold by dynamic authors Piers Anthony and Mercedes Lackey is a wonderful read with many well formed characters and a storyline that will keep you reading. I have read some other reviews and have not found as much support as this book merits. Although this book is just shy of the normal structure of the average fantasy book, it makes up for it by taking the reader through a spectrum of emotions with the help of rounded characters and inspired wording. I have read and re-read this book many times and have not found it to be lacking in storyline or enjoyability. For any fans of the authors this book is a must read. You wont regret it."
4,A toy you feel sorry for...,"I was browsing the Star Wars toys looking for my usual buys of Boba Fetts and Bikerscouts when my eyes came to rest on the good captain. His face is one of a scared child. Not horrified mind you, just cought off guard like they want to say some thing but can't.Feeling sorry for the toy that is apparently Fan Choice #5 I bought it.Unfortunetly thigns didn't get any better as that day was the 4th of July and he met some fire workers. Let me tell you first hand ""Rebels don't fly!"" That being the case this toy can with stand being set on fire, dowsed with water, trampling by an adult male and still make it out with little to no damage. The damage mine recieved can be buffed out with sandpaper."
4,A good read,"This was a fun read. Enjoyed the story but had some problems with a couple of things:1. My Gawd... I was so distracted in the chapters of Kester and Harry with the overused phrase of ""to do the done thing"". I was sick of reading it. Howatch could have reduced them in half and it would still have been too much.2. I skipped right through the last chapter "" Hal"". It got a little boring. As far as I was concerned, the story ended with ""Harry"".But all in all a good read."
5,Nneka pleases the mind and soul,"I selected this album because it contained some of the same songs as the newer (US) release. Nneka has a voice somewhere between Erykah Badu and Macy Gray. Her vocal stylings are unique, sincere, and her lyrics cover a range of topics, making references that range from biblical to political. If you like music to groove to, or sing along to, and your worldview is not limited, you will enjoy Nneka. She gets you fired up on certain tracks--and other tracks are simply uplifting. It will be interesting to see how successful she is in the United States."
4,a truly wonderful collection,"if i had to describe Anthony Hecht in one word, it would be regal. there is no poet who looks more dignified or acts with more dignity. and his poetry is full of grace, dignity, and a quiet power. it is no wonder that hecht is as respected as he is. the poems in this collection are ones to be read slowly, over time, in order to fully digest what makes hecht such a magnificant poet."
2,Its about Palmer not Gorecki,"I like the Gorecki 3rd but, in one of his characteristically excessive moments Tony Palmer really goes over the top here. Passages of a filmed version with Dawn Upahaw and David Zimnan are seen with pictures from WW2 and famine in Africa. I know we have to be aware of all this but Palmer's use of this footage is unnecessary. The music speaks for iteslf. Palmer shows scenes from the Holocaust even though Gorecki himself said that his music is not about that. The movie is more about Palmer and his overblown ideas about cinema. Gorecki is really secondary. Also many of the moments with Upshaw are in shadow. Stupid, really stupid. Listen to the CD (that has sold over 1 million copies) but avoid this dreadful film."
5,Exemplary Genealogy Research,"This book begins with Captain William Maclin, originally from Scotland, who settled in Brunswick County, Virginia in the early 1700's. Compared to sloppier works, this book takes extra care to include references, including the work of other reputable genealogists and the full text of numerous wills (which researchers LOVE!). The author tackles apparent discrepancies head-on and helps to clear up confusion with similar and evolving names. Although the book includes the obligatory endless names and dates for reference purposes, the discussions have an unusual amount of charm. For the genre of amateur genealogies, it stands out for thoroughness, readability, and lots of good references. Though it falls a bit short compared to contemporary production standards, it is definitely a best-in-class for its time, so it gets 5 stars."
3,Some good stuff...,"There are easy to read little chapters that are contained in this book. Some very inspiring ones...but stuff I've heard before. If one follows what Dorothy says, they are bound to see changes. But again, it's stuff I've read before."
3,"""Mediorcre""",Other then 3 songs this album stunk. American Idiot is green Day's best song ever and never gets old. Boulivard of Broken Dreams is a good song with a nice story. St. Jimmy's is a good fast song all around and a very likeable song. This album was Green Day's best but it doesn't say a lot.
4,"""There's Better Music Out There But You Don't Want Us To Know!""(Calibretto 13)",Green day is a vary talented band so why did they just get popular with this cd. They had many great cds. Green day is good but isnt the best. Im not putting them down its just the people who listen or say they listen to them because they are the so called (GREATEST). This is a good cd put please listen to other things and dont follow the growd and listen to what they are because there is other music out there. Thank you
1,Doesn't even deserve one star,"This whole cd, and Green Day in general, are absolute garbage. They sound just like every other ""punk"" (aka crap) band today and they can't even write a single decent song. The lyrics are either corny (Boulevard of Broken Dreams) or stupid (American Idiot), as is the music as a whole. I borrowed this cd from my uncle, and I was not impressed in the least bit. I don't understand why these guys are popular at all."
1,Crap before crap now,"Green Day has always been for little girls looking for a rock band. For this album they put on some black makeup were some black clothes and follow in the footsteps of some other wuss rockers like New Found Glory and Good Charlotte. This album brings nothing new or exciting to the table. But if you are looking for another lame pop album that will get played constantly on TV, this is the album for you."
4,Good but.....,Don't get me wrong this is a good album but I wish billie would stop singing like he's from england because he's not.Other then that it is a good album
1,A joke and a swindell.,"This is without a doubt Green days worst album, infact the whole album is a total abstract from their previous albums.This nothing more than a rubbishy poppy money making piece of plastic, and sounds nothing like their previous music which is absolutely outstanding and back when they had something to say and songs they played, that actually mattered.New to Green Day?""Dookie"" ""Insomniac"" ""Nimrod"" even ""Warning"" are all great records. Back when they meant it.Green Day are faking it now."
2,Don't say this review isn't helpful because of the rating...,"Green Day's American Idiot would be a lot easier to listen to if I didn't fall asleep in the middle of it all the time.This is THE worst album in my collection simply because it's boring and there's only 4 good songs on it, the rest is EXTREMELY boring.Don't buy this cd, but be sure to ask for a copy from your Green Day fanatic wannabe friends so that you know what you're missing."
1,why are people listening to this weak crap,just because your a kid it doesnt mean you have to listen to fake pop crap like if you want to listen to some real punk rock listen something like the dam-ed or the sex pistols and let this crap die out already so something worthwhile can come alongand like the other reviewer said people should stop listening to trl also that crap just rolls out the same safe fake bland pop junk over and over agian why do you want to waste your time with that? let trl goaway and will then get to see what real rock is really like
3,Best since Dookie,"This one is without doubt better than the three albums that followed Dookie-Insomniac, Nimrod and Warning. It is a natural progression from the experimenting seen in Warning, and it feels much more passionate than the boredom that seemed to taint the recording of Insomniac and Nimrod (not that Nimrod is a bad record-the band said themselves that they were feeling tired and had to take to take a break after recording and performing it, that's all). At it's best, American Idiot is very good-there's the throwaway catchiness of She's a Rebel, the melodic verses of Give Me Novocaine, the 9 minute opus Jesus of Suburbia, and the power-keg of absolute brilliance that is Letterbomb. Sometimes good songs are spoilt by mediocre choruses-Holiday and Give Me Novocaine have excellent verses and intros, but choruses that do not live up to the rest of the song. All in all it's three and a half star experience-above average and recommended."
1,No Way....,"THIS BAND SUCKS!!!!!! On Wikipedia.org they are listed as the 80th greatest hard rock group of all time, which I find highly disturbing, mostly because they are before Primus, who, being Altmetal Idols and also a band composed of three people..... Long story short, Primus is better. Green Day: livin' breathin' proof you can make millions with no talent. I would NEVER waste money on a piece of junk like this, with no talent coming from any of the musicians. Long Live Les Ler and Herb.""Money for nothin'....."""
2,"strong arrangements, good hooks","These guys know how to turn a little melody into a big tune. Boulevard of Broken dreams is as simple as a tune gets (if you heard someone humming it you might think it was from the ""Barney"" show), but crank up the amps and it sounds sort of tough. Simiarly, Wake Me Up When September Ends becomes powerful due to the strong arranging skills of the band and/or producer.These guys will not win any awards for their chops as musicians, but that is what makes them so appealing. The 11-year old green day fan (a huge part of their fan base) can learn this stuff on his guitar at home.Their use of explicit words to make them seem rebellious or something apparently helps them sell records to young kids who think that cursing equates with cool. Paired with the tried and true ""the government is bad"" lyric technique, Green Day have found a formula for wealth.They can write a tune, though."
4,Give me novacaine!!!!!!,"Powerfull and as usual fun always fun as the main ingredient that Green Day add in their music , you have to listen ""give me novacaine"" wow !!! wow !!! wow !!! I love this kind of bizarre passionate songs , the band have also reached certain level of maturity and thats ok , they cant continue forever on the same careless mood and simplicity in their lyrics, that simply had to come soon or later if this kids want to continue in showbussiness, ""wake me up when september ends"" is a beautifull piece, for obvious reasons that song will make remove your fibers, the rest of the songs are very good and that kind of epic songs are excellent , Green Day has offered a great album once again, nobody expected lessHM"
2,I dont understand the hype,"I've never been compelled to write a review on Amazon until I started reading some of these reviews for American Idiot. Ok I listened to the cd 3 times, I gave it a fair chance. But cmon people, I swear I heard 4 power chords the whole album. Even Tre Cool falls way short on this effort. Thats the only talent Green day had going for them. No song sticks out on this album, it all sounds like what we expect from the modern pop rock movement. Over produced, dull sounding garbage. Thank you"
3,Too much trash,"I am dissappointed in this CD. My son loves Green Day but I don't love some of the lyrics. Can't they say what they need to say without foul language? Many other bands and songwriters do. My son says he doesn't pay attention to it, but I'm afraid if he listens too much he will start to pick up these nasty habits. I am saving Green Day for another day when he is older and can understand and handle such music."
1,awful,"This is just crap. This is not punk rock. Listen to the clash if you want punk rock. This is pop,boring a rip off and more bad things. Overplayed music dont buy it."
2,not a kid,songs i like: #1 #3 #4songs i dont like: all the rest.dont get me wrong...i am sure green is an awesome band but this cd is too overrated and that it's not all it's cooked up to be. all the other songs sounded alike and were just too long. it seems that the song are just dragging on and on. not worth the money.
1,bunch of sell outs!,"They were best back in the 90's when punk was just as good as the punk in the late 70's and 80's, now, its like, punk rock sucks now, Green Day sucks now. ALl Green Day ever sounded like was Miracle Legion back in the 80's, only pumped up."
3,"Good music, interesting lyrics...bad taste","I've never been a huge Green Day fan. I liked ""Good Riddance (Time of your Life)"" but that was about it. Then I heard ""American Idiot"" and ""Boulevarde of Broken Dreams"" and I thought, this is pretty good.Of course I expected to see a prominent ""Warning"" label splashed across the CD cover, but it was still sad to see. Call me soft, goody-goody, or whatever, but personally? I hate swearing. It's uneccessary, and this album is strewn with it. Rather than buying the CD I borrowed it from a friend, and I liked what I heard. The songs are good, some of the lyrics are different and interesting, but the profanity? Too much.If you're not fazed at all by coarse language, then this would be an excellent CD. Otherwise, leave it on the shelf."
1,green day sucks. period.,"this cd sucks. you can do yourself a favor and throw it away and buy 1039 smoothed out slappy hours instead and listen to some ok punk. nothing on american idiot is punk.... just more commercial pop for little girls! i mean come on! if you want real political punk you should listen to some Reagan Youth, Anti-Flag, the Unseen, Cheap Sex, even some Adolescents (they have a few political songs)... so yeah... listen to real punk not this crap"
1,*Sigh* another anti american album,"And so we have another band that thinks America are evil and power hungry. Blah Blah Blah we've heard this all before. We embrace this idea and say ""Oh they're just making their voice heared"". But I KNOW if someone made an album called French Idiot the news will shove that story down our throats."
2,not as good as their old old stuff,"didnt like this album much.holiday was really good, but the rest of this album annoyed me."
2,Not Really liking it..,"Hello, i've like green day for a fair while.. (i have all their cd's before ""American Idiot"") and i was so exicted to hear that they had a new cd coming out. but i was very disapointed when i heard it. At first I really likd it.. i borrow it from my firned it and listening to it 13 times straight.. but now the two songs on the radio ""Americian Idiot"" and ""Bulevard of Broken Dreams"" are egtting on my nereves.. i find this music who to pop-punky for good green day music, it's okay for a few times but now that everyone ""loves"" green day even though, they only know that they have one cd out it is PISSING me off.. anyways.. that's all"
4,If Only It Weren't For The Title Track...,"This is one hell of a CD. The Story of Armstrong and the way the CD moves is amazing. The music and lyrics are both good. The music is good all the way through and the same with the lyrics with the exception of one track. The lyrics for American Idiot are a pain in the a**. The idea that this country is run by the media and that rednecks are in charge is absurd. For one thing my Grandparents and great grandparents are rednecks and I know damn well that they counldn't run the country. The lyrics for this song pissed me off because some people find it offensive and hell, I have nothing against the song. Its great, but I just think that the lyrics are stupid. But after that come Jesus of Suburbia and , while borderline sacrelige at times, it is an amazing song about a broken home that has one child that can't seem to find his happiness. I think that this CD is great and I can't wait for the next one."
3,"Great music, but do these guys like anybody?","I've always felt that entertainers should entertain, not protest, campaign or criticize government. The music on this cd is incredible. While some songs do sound like retreads of past songs, overall the music is great and, in some cases, very original.But these guys seem to be anti-everything. anti-war, anti-peace, anti-wealthy, anti-redneck, anti-social, anti-conservative, anti-christian, anti-Jesus, anti-government. Geez, get over it, already."
2,every 12 year 0ld girl+boys favorite band,i like green daybut this is so over ratedits a avrage what is eveyone geting so hyped about!!!!!!!now everone likes them
1,Green Day makes a musically crap record for the first time.,"Ever since Nimrod, Green Day have been losing it.While Nimrod had some good original sounding fast rock songs, it also contained the horribly popular ""Good Riddance"" and alot of trumpets and harmonicas on it.The middle part of the record was good.As for the next album Warning well that was pretty bland.And it sounded way to poppy and way too popular amoungst ""popular music"" oviously.Although musically both thoses albums were good, Green Day have made this time (and after 4 years of waiting!!) the most boringest typically lame and stupid album that they could of made.This without a doubt the worst and most uninteresting record, and they never quite blew it untl this.At least ""Warning"" and ""Nimrod"" had something to offer musically, but this is just commercialised rubbish.And they're touring with Simple Plan, another wastefull disgusting and dreadful band.That says it all."
5,One of the defining albums of our generation.,"I was never much of a Green Day fan until I bought this album. Heck I'd never really even knew about them. I bought this album on a whim as much as any anything else. I hate how much the radio plays this album though. Radio ruins good music. This is not a radio album, you can't really get the meaning of the CD unless you listen to the whole thing. This will be an album that people will remember years from know, and it should have won the Grammy for Best Album no offense to Ray Charles."
2,Punk? Hardly.,"Over the years, Green Day has always had a distinct sound; it's what has made them interesting.""American Idiot"" is a disapointment to long-time fans. Most of the stuff on this album could be on an Avril Lavigne record. Cliche, pop-esqued, and mediocre, the band's new album is nothing special.Coming from a long-time Green Day fan, save your money. The only people that will buy this album are all the Good Charlotte fans."
1,American Idiot by American idiot,"hey all you green day fans! Waz up!! I really hate this album, I don't usually hate this band but OMG this album and American Idiot are so bad! I read all one star reviews and those people are pretty nice. There's a really good band for you guys punk fans, they're call Strike Anywhere. They are not as famous as goddamn green day but they're absloutly better than green day.Go buy their album right now and stop listen to Boulevard of Broken Dreams, that is a really evil song just like wake me up blah blah blah...Thanks for reading."
1,not worth it,"Any objective listener could take a bit of time working through the assertions offered in support of 5-star reviews here, revealing them to be at best ideological claptrap and wishful thinking. But perhaps Stephen Thomas Erlewine provided the best exposition on how awful this work actually is. It is important to note that Erlewine is such a fan of Green Day that he has persisted in gushing over the band's meager, lackluster efforts from the very beginning, contrary to all evidence. Here, however, in a lucid moment, he inadvertently tells the truth: ""dismiss it after one listen as a bit of a mess."" That says it all. Heck, if you're really motivated to get rid of that cash, send me ten bucks and I'll send you back a mess you'll listen to once. I'll do it for eight, even."
1,Fools!,"green day is horrible band. the only thing they succeed at is repeating 4 chords over and over again and enslaving the minds of all who listen to them. This is an insult to bands who make real music, and don't just copy everyone else and call it original like green day. In case anyone didn't notice, american idiot sounds exactly like a lot of the songs on international superhits. boulevard of broken dreams and holiday are almost exactly the same, and the rest of the album doesn't deserve any of my attention at all, even for criticism. What possible reason could you have for listening to this when there are still amazing bands like the yardbirds, cream, led zeppelin and jimi hendrix that still haven't earned their share of popularity among modern america?"
1,Blah!,Greed Day sucks and always will! They are a bunch of sell-outs and this album is their worst (all the others were bad also). But here GD are joining to the mainstream and making gay songs like boulevard of broken dreams. Green Day sux!F**K GREEN DAY!!
5,green day,"i think green day is totally awesome and this album is also...but if u liked ther old stuff, u might not like this one cuz it is a little ""pop""ish. i still think that all their work is awesome though"
3,Wake Me Up When September Ends from the Boulevard Of Broken Dreams,2 great songs. Some uneccesary swearing. That's about it.GG NO RE.
5,Best Punk Rock CD I have...... and i have a lot!,"When I first popped this CD into my player I thought ""Dang this kills all my other CD's."" And that was just hearing one song! It has a great beat, lyrics that anyone could die for, and three of the most popular hits in the world ""American Idoit"", ""Holiday""' and my favorite ""Boulevard Of Broken Dreams"". If you do not have this CD than GET OF YOUR BUTT AND GO BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Great punk but a little explicit,"This is a great CD by Green Day, even though it is a little explicit. It has two popular songs played on the radio, both American Idiot and Boulevarde of Broken Dreams. The rest of their songs are good as well. I would recommend this CD for those of you who like punk and rock."
1,This is why I have little faith in modern bands,"Oh my god what have they done? Is it just me or is it that ever scince the release of this new album Green day has become another one of MTV's little drones? The fact that they would spend as much money as they did on a music video is actually quite anti-punk and offends me greatly. If you have no depth and don't care about whether or not a band is a big money seeker with no other goal then you might like this, if not search elsewhere. If you must have your Green day fix please listen to their older albums and only if you absolutley need to because those arn't that great either. If you say ""Ooh good charolette isn't punk (which they arnt) they just wear all that makeup to look cool."" Well guess what people Green day is just as guilty so dont complain and dont buy this album."
1,MAN these guys suck,"They should have stopped when they made Kerplunk - Everything after that is raw sewage. I don't care if you disagree, at least they could have changed the name of the band if they were going to start making bad music.-nuff said"
4,"Not punk, but who cares?","I'm not going to try to argue how this is a punk record, because it's not. I know what punk is, I grew up listening to bands like Minor Threat, Black Flag, Circle Jerks, etc., and I can still appreciate a good record when I hear it. I've always been a fan of greenday, and I think this cd is their 2nd best after Dookie. I like how they are bringing political awareness to the mainstream, maybe this will get the kids thinking? It's not perfect, but it is definately worth buying.Standout tracks: American Idiot, Jesus of Suburbia, Holiday, Boulevard of Broken Dreams, St. Jimmy, Give me Novacaine, Letterbomb, Wake me up when september ends."
5,green day rocks,I love this cd! I think it should have won album of the year at the Grammys.american idiot 10/10jesus of surburbia 8/10 (favorite part is tales of another broken home.)holiday 9/10blvd of broken dreams 100000000000/10 (should have been nominated and won the song of the year at the Grammys)are we waiting 6/10st.jimmy 8.5/10don`t have time to rate the rest.
2,[2.5 stars] pretty tired of this,"This is just an average band with average songs. Nothing more and nothing less. Boulevard of Broken Dreams? it was good the first few times I heard it, now it's so repetitive and just boring, same with American Idiot, Holiday, and Wake Me Up When Setember Ends.The one thing no one gets is:REAL ROCK BANDS DO NOT DRESS UP IN BLACK AND RED, AND [laughs],WEAR EYELINER AND MAKE UP.TRUE ROCK IS NOT ABOUT IMAGE OR MUSIC VIDEOS.IT'S ABOUT GOOD MUSIC."
3,I dont know if I like this or not,"Has Green Day really sold out? This is so commercial and so far from being Punk its not even funny. This album is a rock opera, yes a rock opera! You cant get more anti-punk then writing and recording a rock opera. I mean leave that up to Queen and The Who! There are like three punk songs, the title track 'American Idiot' 'Holiday' and 'St. Jimmy' everything else is popish and commercial, everything Green Day shouldnt be. dont get me wrong some of the other songs are good but they are far from great. This is honestly the worst Green Day album they ever made! While this is a good album its far from being a great Green Day record!"
3,Something nice....,"This is a good album.....it is something nice to listen to....nothing different here....just something to enjoy once in a while......IT IS NO ""Sgt Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band""....and if you do not like the beatles...maybe something a little newer like the white stripes Elephant...we all know Bluesrock is the best rock.-3-Goo Goo Gjoob"
3,Did Not Meet Expectations . . .,"The new Green Day album did not meet my expectations. I don't know if it met yours. It was less ""punk"" then their other albums. The two songs that make this album stand out are American Idiot and Boulevard of Broken Dreams. Jesus of Suburbia is funny at some parts but others it is so boring and too long. I was hoping for a much harder and faster album than this one."
2,New meaning to Ripped off,"Well, reading through these reviews, I figured, hey, doesn't seem bad, rarely have reviews been so wrong. Where do you I even start, I don't want to make too much of it, because my 2 stars should pretty much speak for themselves, but there is nothing new in this at all. There is no innovation, you pretty much hear the same riffs and powerchords in every song. They all kind of run together and blend, unfortunately, with a non-cohesive overall experience. I guess I should have known what I was getting into. I'm glad I have Motorhead's Inferno to get me through the disharmony that American Idiot left in my mind. Sure made me feel like an American Idiot when I bought it.The only reason I gave it 2 stars is the fact that I definately have some listening bias, and although this would appeal to some, you're all better off just burning it, and saving your money for something good (like Motorhead's Inferno, or Megadeths The System Has Failed)."
3,Great..,"It's been almost 15? years since Green Day came out and their music is still solid. 'American Idiot' is a great first track...So why the 3 stars? Well, afterawhile these political albums get annoying, sorry GD.Be sure to pick up Bonnie McKee's debut album 'Trouble' on the 28th, she's just great ;)"
1,Thin,"From the very title of this album, you might think that Green Day might back up their claim with their music, man, they were always a pop band, and they could never go deep as to title their album american idiot. If you like pop and like following the masses like a true american idiot then buy this album. I always thought Green Day were posers, they do not offer anything new to the musical landscape, that's why they are pop.I go out of my way to review a pop album because I'm just pissed at all the credit they get for their crap."
2,uh........just read the review already!,"Okay, well, I seriously liked this album to say the least. If you know absolutely nothing about the band but think you might want to get into it, this is a good place to start. Or just get Dookie, that's an awesome album too. Oh, and the picture with the heart grenade, it has to do with the line from the 8th song, ""She's A Rebel"". One of the lines is ""She's holding on my heart like a hand grenade."" Man, it took me MONTHS to figure that out! A few words of wisdom: just blatently ignore the meaning of the lyrics (except Wake Me Up When September Ends) and you'll be fine."
1,Used to be good.,"This band stopped being cool when ""Good Riddance"" became all the rage as nice pop little pop song."
2,"(not u-13, but didn't have an account.)","Green Day has totally mainstream with this album, which disappointed me. New fans who have never heard Green Day before will love the new Green Day, and hate the old Green Day because their older music is much different than this new album. I am extremely disappointed, for this album is pure pop-punk and none of the songs are even really that good. Green Day has sold out with this album. Check out their older albums, they are much better worth listening to if you like REAL punk music."
5,A Masterpiece Beyond All Calculable Measure,"I have been a fan of Green Day for a very long time. Everything they put out is awesome and deserves praise. I was particularly drawn to this album because of the awesome single ""American Idiot"" because of Billie Joe's view of the country and its morals and beliefs and I could not help but say that I agree with and see what he is talking about through the lyrics. So naturally I bought the album, and I was blown away by the whole thing. From start to finish this album is one of the best albums I have ever heard. It is supremely written. It is a masterpiece. It is definately one of the greatest albums ever written. Buy this album, you will not be dissapointed."
3,Amazon MP3 Version,"I really enjoyed the album American Idiot. It's a 5 star album to me, despite all the hate derived from all the praise. Like it or not, it's going to be one of the defining albums of 2000-2010 era. Chris Lord-Alge is the master of making power chords sound epic...However, Amazon consolidates the original 13 tracks into 9. The tracks Holiday/Boulevard of Broken Dreams, Are We the Waiting/St. Jimmy, Give Me Novacaine/She's a Rebel, Extraordinary Girl/Letterbomb, are all combined. Meaning you have to listen them together. Bleh..."
1,One of the least talented bands in the world,"Green Day are one of the least talented bands in the world. Green Day is a band made up of juvenile delinquents. Furthermore, they also play talentless music that takes no talent what so ever to create. These songs are simplistic, juvenile, brainless, and made up of only 3 chords! No talent what so ever. I can't believe what music has come to! It has been dumbed down to the point where any di.ckhead who picks up a guitar, learns three chords, and writes a bunch of brainless lyrics all about some dubious, nebulous notion of ""freedom"" is hailed as a musical genius and instantly becomes a ""rock star""! Green Day is by far the world's most overrated and most talentless band. I hate Green Day! I wish somebody would drop a ""LETTERBOMB"" at a Green Day concert and put an end to this crap!"
1,"For the love of God, stop listening to this!!!!!!!!!!!","Please stop listening to this horrible excuse for music. Green Day is not, and never was PUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is are a band for twelve-year -old girls with no taste in music!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Dean Gray is so much better,"seriouslycelebrate Dean Gray Tuesdayits a holiday in californiahe made this album not suck as muchNovocaine Rhapsody, fo rizzle"
1,green gook,"not as good as Larry Young Mother Ship or Sam Rivers contours yo punk fans what makes punk so good/??????????????what makes jazz so bad NOT SMOOTH JAZZ likr free jazz. are punks talanted??????????? albert alyer could eat us. i bet some of u like punk just because it's popular if all your friends liked country and it was popular u would like that to. all the popular kids in my school like rap what a quiecedence, because it's popular. but it's not like anywwhey listens to me and go's and listens to larry young and changes their mind about jazz and likes it. anywhey if i said this oraly people would throw tomatoes at me u hate me"
1,Violent Billie Joe,"Why does Billie Joe constantly sing about cutting up women for the pleasure of torturing women?! That loser has nothing better to do!""I don't wanna be an American Idiot, don't want a nation with my wife, so I'm gonna kill her, and she's going down to the anti graveyard."" very unamusing songs! Billie Joe is a loser!Check out Sugarcult or Good Charlotte, they don't sing about cutting up people and killing his kids and making his dog high."
4,You tell 'em,"OK, fair enough, Green Day were the first (major) band with the guts to actually call the Bush administration out for what it is (or what they think it is, anyways). I'm puzzled how people can say the lyrics don't even make sense - I have no problem figuring out what the songs are about! So I give the lyrical review - 5 stars. I'm not a fan of punk rock so I can't fairly review this CD in musical terms, so I gave it 3 stars - middle ground. The average # stars is therefore 4 stars. (I wonder if the people who can't figure out the meaning of the lyrics, will be able to follow that.)"
5,Good mainstream political-punk,"If you like this album, you should check out the following:1.) Reject All American - Bikini Kill2.) No Kill No Beep Beep - Q and Not U3.) 13 Songs - Fugazi4.) Double Nickels on the Dime - The Minutemen5.) This Nations Saving Grace - The Fall6.) More Adventurous - Rilo Kiley7.) The Ugly Organ - Cursive"
4,Huh?,"Listen, I hate the politics but I gotta admit these guys are tight on this. Best drumming I've heard in a while."
2,Old Music Is Better Music,"Some of the songs are allright and i agree with their political views in american idiot (even though im only 14) but when k104 (local pop, hip hop, rap all that crap teenage girls listen to) starts playing boulevard of broken dreams regulalry you now theres something wrong with this album, all the kids in my school say how much they love green day, but either the only songs theyve ever heard are american idiot, boulevard of broken dreams, and holiday cause thats what they see on mtv, or like my friend jake, when i tried to convince him acdc and led zeppelin and green day were good bands in the 4th grade he said no smash mouth is ten x better (he's nuts) and once he heard boulevard of broken dreams on the radio and started listening to green day he says he's liked green day all his life along with jimmy hendrix anda whole bunvh of other good music, but little kids, if you want some good green day listen to dookie it's my favorite album by them"
2,I wonder...,Sometimes I wonder what Green Day would be singing about if the political climate in America were different.Who knows? They'd probably be singing about something stupid like dookie.
1,Unfortunate.,"Wow, it's 2005, and the music industry is STILL spitting-out overproduced and cliched leftist rants from pin-heads. Now, we all understand that there's a market for sobbing teen-aged bedwetters, but must they be pandered to in this way? I think not. Seeing, however, that this is still a free society, I choose to chuck this pile of nonsense onto the junkheap of history. Punk rock is such a bore!!! Please, get a new act; it's really getting old!!!"
1,Zevon was lifelong smoker and asbestos is cover-up excuse,"Since you 230-strong sadistically specialize in needily depending on self-destructed musicians, AT LEAST have the grudgingly half-decent (because sinful idolism's censurable NO MATTER who you subject yourselves to) sense and taste to idolize someone whose music isn't as tragically vomitous as Self-destroyer's!!!! I command you to idolatrize Kurdt Kobain, AND NO ONE ELSE, because at least his music didn't suck, comparable to your lowness of Zevon hero worship, that is. The last and final insult which overstepped the line for me is Zevon's four-eyed face on the jacket of Breaking Wind. This cancer-afflicted suicide is blatantly plotting to capitalize on feloniously easy, subdued, weak sympathy from liberals!!!! Zevon accomplishes this by scornfully plastering his soon-to-be-deceased, cancerously tumorous prison mugshot on the sleeve."
1,what a joke,greenday the super queer poser band that appeals to punk rockers who wear tommy hilfiger another lame cd by the worst band in history a dork who sounds retarded with a stuffy nose [...]while the generic horrible guitarist plays the same 2 chords he has since the 90s everything about this cd is lame and not worth 1 dollar but im sure you total f dorks will buy this and ride your karma skateboard around
1,"I ARGEE, TAKE THIS JUNK OFF OF THE PUNK ROCK LISTINGS AMAZON-ITS POP NOT PUNK ROCK-GIVE PUNK ROCK THE RESPECT IT DESERVES","i think hlsaylors review talks for itsself-take this fake junk off the punk rock listings amazon-ether your punk or your pop-give punk rock the respect it deserves, February 19, 2006Reviewer: M. saylor ""hlsaylor"" - See all my reviewswhy is this junk even listed under punk rock? anyone who knows what real punk rock sounds like knows that this isnt real punk rock, its just boybands who want to seem tough and/or deep. if you want to know what real punk rock truely sounds like in all of its raw, hardcore form then listen to the sex pistols album -Never Mind the Bollocks Here's the Sex Pistols- or listen to any sex pistols album and then, if you cant handle that, please stop calling yourself a punk rocker ok?-ALSO STOP WATCHING TRL IF THAT SHOW GOES AWAY THEN MAYBE WE WILL START TO SEE SOME TRUELY GREAT MUSIC COME ALONG"
3,Okay...,"This book was not what I would consider a real comedy, though it was funny at parts. It was not a great book, though not horrible. It at least keeps you entertained."
2,Bach done porly,"I have heard Bach transcribed for everything from harmonica to electric guitar and he usually sounds good...but not in this case. Lifeless and boring interpretations. The ""surround"" effects just get tiresome. DTS does little to improve the sonics...a real stinker!"
5,a classic soon to be,"Max and Alex did something very few people could and can do, they got together and jammed and came up with some stellar tunes, just because they could and they came up with really catchy metal tunes, Nailbomb was a fluke and it worked, the only other band that worked was S.O.D. where it was one shot and bang! there done. why it took so long for these guys to produce this video is beyond me, but it was well worth the wait, surprisingly this DVD is well produced and filmed very professionally. the only thing i can see that is wrong is that there is no extras or backstage stuff at all, just the concert, but for this band that is good enough. get it it is raw, you wont be disappointed"
1,Received Tarnished Necklace!,"I was excited to give this as a gift to my girlfriend for Christmas. When I looked at the necklace that I had received, I could not believe they would ship something so black and tarnished. I don't know how there are so many positive reviews on here, the piece I received was complete junk.Update: The seller contacted me, and offered to let me purchase another necklace with waived shipping, to replace the one I returned. They offered an explanation about silver tarnishing easily, and perhaps the plastic bag it was in wasn't completely sealed. In light of this, and the fact that tarnishing is a natural process, I have taken the picture down, but I still want the review to stay up as a warning of what you might get."
2,Didn't like it!,"I was disappointed in this chain. I actually ordered two, one 18 inch and one 20 inch, but sent them both back. They were sturdy but the silver was almost unnaturally bright for sterling. It looked fake and did not match the sterling pendant I wanted to put on it. I almost kept them because of the awesome price just to see if they developed somewhat of a patina, but in the end decided to return them. Of course, with Amazon, returning was a breeze!"
2,Sterling Silver Chain,"I really liked it when I received it. However, after wearing it for a few days, the part of the chain that was closest to my neck discolored. I have never experienced that with other silver chains. I had diffulculty cleaning it with silver polish and that area is nowhere as shiny as the rest of the chain. I would not purchase this again."
5,Awesome,I love these. I need more of them. I will look for a variety of mm and length and then I'll be ever so happy
4,Good value,"Attractive, well made chain, nothing special, just a good value. It seems sturdy enough to hold up to frequent use."
3,Mixed feelings on this chain,"I purchased this necklace for the first time in August 2010 in my quest to find something shiny, durable, and sturdy. I wear this necklace everyday - including when I run, climb, ski, etc (not swimming), and I only take it off occasionally. The first one last over 2 years!! It stayed nice and shiny with minimal kicks in the cord. I did find that small kinks could cause my hair to get caught in it, as another review noted.Fairly happy with it, I purchased a replacement, and this one has lasted less than 1 month! There is a significant kink in the cord - way bigger than any that were in my first one - and I am very afraid that this weak spot will cause it to break already. I am not aware of any outstanding event that caused it, I just noticed it one day. I am hoping this one was just an outlier but am still hesitant to buy a third one. I suppose the take away is that no necklace is invincible!"
4,Sterling Silver 1mm Sturdy Snake Chain,"This is really a good buy. The weight is substantial and it is very shinny. The only suggestion is to buy both the 18"" and 20"" as you'll need both to accommodate all necklines."
4,Great chain!,"I love it! The only thing is I wish the clasp was a little larger.It is hard for my ""old"" hands to manipulate. Otherwise, itis beautiful and just what I wanted."
3,"INTERESTING STORIES, BUT WRITING STYLE BLAH...","The author does a great job of introducing us to some of New York's finest, but her writing style is a bit hard to follow. She writes like she's some type of tough New York city cop herself, rather than objectively. I got the feeling that she had her own political agenda throughout the text. Great idea for a book but writing could have been much, much better."
4,Low-budget Punk-rock Cult Classic,"Suburbia is a punk-rock cult classic. Made with an extremely low budget and starring genuine street-punks(including the Red Hot Chili Peppers' Flea), the film is funny, chock full o' meaning and undertones, and is full of great anti-authoritarian one-liners. It's a punk-rock must see. Punk bands featured are: early TSOL, D.I. and The Vandals. It centers around of homeless punks called ""T.R."" or ""The Rejected"" who go around vandalizing the city and live-in a shack. I'd go on, but I am at work and I don't have much time. Forgive the simplicity of the review. But if you can get your hands on this rare film, show it to everyone you know.DO NOT CONFUSE THIS FILM WITH THE LATE 90S FILM. THIS IS A PRIMO 80S INDEPENDENT FILM."
3,Escante,"I would have loved the item but it was missing a piece. I was trying to just get the company to send the missing piece but ended up having to send it back. I have yet to hear from the company or receive a refund. If I was able to keep the complete set of product, I would most likely have rated it at 5 stars for the price, material, and fabric. As for the return and contact from the company, so far I rate it at 3 stars and only this high because they paid for the return shipping and handling. If I have better contact, I will return and re-rate as I see appropriate."
4,The Birth of Dirt: Origins of Mountain Biking,As a keen mountain biker of old I thoroughly enjoyed this book.I could not put it down.I will pass this book to friends for them to learn the info.Great book.
2,Filler,"Some storylines are really really dull, some are not. For once, I actually found Elizabeth's story to be ridiculously boring and unbelievable (or maybe that's just the Tom fan side of me talking). And, role reversal, for once (and continuing on through the entirety of the Nick Fox arc), Jessica has a really interesting role to play, one that just keeps getting better and better. I've got to say, of all of Jessica's random guys, Nick is the only one I actually liked, in character and in story. He's a great guy, and I'm just disappointed we didn't get a better ending for his story (and here, my first ever fanficis born XD). I also enjoy reading about Enid/Alex, despite the minor role she plays, but she's finally starting to grow out of Alex, it seems, and that's great. And Celine's just a psychopath.Anyways, the whole book is just filler, IMO, the real action is in the books after this..."
3,Not violin friendly,"Since I play violin solo for weddings on occasion, I bought this collection. Unfortunately it proved to be not very useful for the following reasons:(1) There are several long 8va passages. Give me ledger lines any day! 8va's are like clef changes - hard to process on the fly. For intermediate players this may be okay since it gives them the option of playing the melody in the lower octave.(2) Key for Mendelssohn's Wedding March was changed from the original C major to A-flat (4 flats). Not only is the key more difficult, it doesn't sound quite as good.(3) The violin/flute part for Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring only has the chorale melody. The triplet melody that this piece is best known for is in the piano accompaniment, which is okay unless you plan to play this piece solo.A much better collection is the Violin & Piano Wedding Collection from Latham Music Ltd. (run the name through a search engine)."
1,Doesn't even deserve one star.,"These tubes will make you work harder on your bike. Since they are solid, there is more mass for you to move, meaning you will hae to pedal harder. But thats not the main issue I had with them. They are really soft (they don't get as hard as a tire with standard tube.) They run as if you are riding a bike with a flat. I had these on my 20"" BMX bike. Had them on for one night, And returned them the following day. Walmart tried to tell me that they won't return them since they are used. I explained all their faults, and how I was amazed that they stand by a product as worthless as this one. I eventually got my refund. But I'd rather let you people know, so you don't make the same mistake I did."
1,Do not buy,"Second set of these things. First set was for a bike with 20x1.95 tires. I bought the ones for 20x 1.75-1.95. They are too loose for that bike but they work somewhat. Next bike 20x2.125. I bought the 20x2.125 tubes and they are way too big the tire would not even go on the rim. I tried for a couple of hours. Followed the directions and tried many other things but no go. I have fixed tires on tractors, car, and tractor trailers. I would rather do those any day. I am going to send these pieces of junk back."
2,Solid inner tube,"After countless problems with flats, I made the decision to go Bell No-Mor inner tube.I had to take it off and go back. No coast at all. you stop pedaling. you stop. Like riding on a flat.Maybe if you weigh less than 75 lbs, maybe. I will retry when I need to change the front inner tube."
4,Great idea - but it's not for fat tires ... yet!,"Most people who use 26"" tubes are either on mountain bikes with fat tires or cruisers with fat tires. If Bell is listening they will produce a 26"" x 1.125 version so it will not flex sideways on turns when put into all those fat tires. I would also like to add that bicycle shops, electric bike mechanics & auto tire shops should have a ""jig"" for EZ installs. ""Cruiser Bob"" Kiger"
5,Fantastic replacement - Powerful and longer lasting,"This replacement battery has brought my Dewalt drill back to life! The old batteries were losing power after ten minutes use. This new battery is delivering power for much longer than the originals, even when they were new. Charges fast on the old charger as well."
5,Perfect Fit,"We have a totally standard size, ugly black metal mailbox, and my husband hated it, so rather than going out and spending money on a new one I got him this and it fit great. I also like that it blends in with our original mailbox since it is black but that obviously won't be the case for most other sports teams."
2,Luke warm.... if your 80 yrs old!,"Everyone's idea of erotica is different. Now that that is out of the way, this book sucked. Sure there was a couple of good stories but 99% was hot if you are an 80 yr old person. Erotica should get someone hot and rearing to go. This had me ready to go to bed, and sleep the rest of the night. B_O_R_I_N_G sums up this LAME book."

4,Real Texas Holdem Poker,Completely realistic poker. You have to fold a lot of hands to win. Really fun when you can get a full house and stick it to em...
5,Their best...,"This is easily my favorite REM disc..I've been listening to them ever since Fables first came out in '85. This is the band at it's most creative, ambitious, and inspiring. You won't find 'Green' or 'Document' here. This is the sound of a band evolving..."
2,dark side?,"who can compare this to dark side of the moon? dark side was released in 1973 and no album has come close to it since, and probably no album ever will. Pink floyd did it first, and no one will ever be able to do it again without sounding like a rip-off band. Up is supposed to be as good as dark side? What guitar solos on here can compare to time? Where is the emotional quality of a great gig in the sky? Where is the incredibly dramatic finish to the album like in brain damage/eclipse? Where is the overall brilliant theme of the album that leaves a lasting emotional experience? Nothing will ever be done that can compare with the originality of Pink Floyd."
1,Like Pink Floyd? No way!,"Up is nothing like Pink Floyd. This is NOT invetive music/noise/trash/poetry. REM are over folks, face it! If you want ""poetry"" try a Doors album!As compared to ANY REM CD this is very lackluster. I own this one, and own them all. But this is not one that grows on you. Pure trash, come ON Mike, Michael and Pete! You can do better!"
4,It's mature...,"but that doesn't mean it's rubbish. For REM are on of the world's finest bands, and Up continues to impress. Although well short of masterpiece, Up is a fluid and, contrary to many reviews, easily accessible album. It's highlights are, as usual, the ballads. The exquisite lyric and melody on Daysleeper is particularly touching and inspires me to stay in bed and miss work. At My Most Beautiful chimes with its Beach Boys harmonies and Diminished is bizarre but heartbreaking. A small gem."
2,"Where's the Melody, Kenneth?","After 5 listens, Up! is still a major disappointment. It reminds me most of New Adventures in Hi-Fi but pales terribly in comparison. The songs are stripped of melody and the lyrics seem contrived. Like Smashing Pumpkins' latest, they seem intent on doing their own thing, audience-be-damned (though SP did a better job balancing the two), which is fine, they earned that right. I'll give it a few more listens and I'm still a fan, but I'm expecting something BIG for their next release."
2,I'm sorry...I don't get it.,"I don't know why...but I keep giving them another chance. I've been a fan since the first time I saw R.E.M. for $5 at the Mad Hatter in Athens, GA in 1984. But since Out Of Time, I just don't get it anymore. Now, with ""Up"" I think I'm finished with R.E.M. I've tried, really tried to listen to this CD with an open mind. But I can't even stay awake through ""Airportman"", ""Suspicion"", and most of the rest of it. ""At My Most Beautiful"" was cute, just because Brian Wilson is my musical hero. Unless you want music to put on at night while you're trying to go to sleep, I'd have to recommend passing on this one. Oh, to just hear one more ""I Believe"" or ""Driver 8"" before they finally hang it up."
4,THE NEWEST R.E.M. CD I OWN RIGHT NOW,"THIS ALBUM WAS THE 1ST R.E.M. CD I EVER ACTUALLY BOUGHT. AND I WAS IMPRESSED! AFTER THE VERY DISMAL SALES OF THEIR 1996 ALBUM, ''NEW ADVENTURES IN HI-FI'', R.E.M. CAME BACK WITH THIS GOOD ALBUM. THIS ALBUM WAS PLENTY OF FUN TO LISTEN TO. IT'S NOT ONE OF THEIR BEST, BUT IT'S STILL FUN. THE BEST TRACKS ARE ''LOTUS'', ''AT MY MOST BEAUTIFUL'', ''HOPE'', ''DAYSLEEPER'', AND ''SAD PROFESSOR''. THIS IS A GREAT ALBUM FOR R.E.M. FANS."
5,The best band still has it.,Eventhough they lost the drummer this is a phenominal album. I love the song at my most beautiful. I love all the experimentation on this album. This is not ther best but its better than other groups best.
4,REM GEM,"UP is a CD that appeals dreamy,wistful type guys with their head in the clouds,and thats a lot of us right! This CD relates to Radioheads Ok Computer in the same way as Pet Sounds relates to Sgt Pepper. UP is a permirific work,but sort of a poor cousin to OKC in the same way as Pet Sounds was to Pepper. Beautiful music. But like Pet Sounds a trifle uninspired in places,still well worth buying though."
3,reviews without listening?,how can so many people review and album that has not even been released. Sad. Just goes to show don't believe the hype and wait until you actually HEAR the whole album before rating. I only gave it 3 stars because you HAVE to pick something EVEN if you haven't heard it.
2,The poorest release by REM,"This is the first CD from REM that I could not listen to the end and had to turn it off. This isn't the REM that I know and love. In this release, there's not one track worth listening to let alone enjoy. Don't get me wrong, i'm still a fan of REM, but feel that this album is poor and weak and could have been much better."
1,After this disaster the should have disbanded,"They always said they were going to call it quits in 2000, but no, they had to go on making more uninspired albums. It's sad when artists persist after they have nothing to say. The 80s are long gone...and so is REM. RIP."
4,A bunch of good songs and two GREAT ONES!,"In talking with a lot of REM fans I have always heard them knock this album, saying it was another in the continuing ""decline"" of REM. I have never shared that opinion, this is a solid album. However, what really raises the album in my eyes are the additions of ""Daysleeper"" and ""Walk Unafraid,"" two of REM's finest releases ever. Kind of a continuation of New Adventures, but a tad softer."
5,Another stunning piece,"At first I wasnt sure what to think about this album, Did I like it , hate or it was I indiffrent. After several listens to this album i have to say it not only the best album of 1998, but an album on par with Led Zepplin I II III, Hendrixs Are you Experienced and Bob Dylans Highway 61 Revisted. THis is an increabliy arrangedand prefromed album. Each song is evoactive, each beat and instrument comes in and out at perfect timing, each beat is never wasted and each lyric is fresh and thought provoking. This is an increable album which takes R.E.M. and music in a new direction , one away from the wasted pop of ricky martin and jenfirer lopez, to a new musical height which few bands ever apporach."
3,Not as good as other REM,I was diapointed with the new REM..... it doesnt compare with other REM albums..
2,none of these songs go anywhere; weak effort from R.E.M.,"most of these songs start out with potential, and almost all of them are centered around a nice melodic idea. But none of these songs do anything or go anywhere. You will not be able to tell any difference between the beginning, middle, or end of any given track. Unlike most REM albums, there is nothing poignant or memorable here. The only songs worth sitting through are Daysleeper and Walk Unafraid. Nothing more than mildly pleasant background music."
2,LOL people gave this album five stars?,"People gave this 5 stars? hahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahaI am a die hard REM fan, and this album just sucked. Boring, trite, insignificant, and totally not the REM I loved and knew.Almost borderline horrific, rushed, elevator (like the previous reviewer)Five Stars indeed."
3,Not MONSTER...,"...unless Monster is on his deathbed...I was hooked by the solid rock and force of Monster, and had to change my attitude after hearing UP. When I reach for a R.E.M. cd, most of the time Monster is the one I grab. UP is good, but not enough to unseat a favorite. I Don't Sleep, I Dream...of strong gitaur, drums, and lyrics. The Frequency, Kenneth, of UP is down...next album, VIAGRA??"
5,Give It A Second Try...,"As a huge REM fan I really didn't know what to think of their strange new cd. The second time I listened to it it grew on me. Now I rank it up there as one of their best. Favorite songs include ""You're In The Air"" and ""Walk Unafraid"". Be patient with this cd and you will be rewarded!"
1,VERY sad,"What happened here? Is this the same people that gave us Murmur or Fables? Obviously, Bill had more impact than one could've realized. Looks like it is time for the guys to either hang it up or hit the road as a ""novelty"" act. UP only gets me DOWN thinking about what could've been. Time for a greatest hits package, then time to retire. This is so sad for a wonderful band. Looks like they can't go back to Rockville."
5,Love Inspector Lewis!,We like the Inspector Lewis mystery series. The product is packaged very well and the DVD's all play very well. We are very pleased with the quality of the DVD's.
4,this is a great movie,"This movie is one of my favorites. And that's not only because it has Richard Dean Anderson, from MacGyver-fame, starring in it. The story in itself is a great story of a man, who is send to war and who has to cope with the personal aftermath. He has to learn to love himself again before he can let anyone else love him. It has some great acting in it too: very believable."
3,Readable history of a less-written-about Union army,"Larry Daniel performs a helpful service for students of the Civil War with this comprehensive history of the Union's Army of the Cumberland, from its initial formation and incarnation as the Army of the Ohio to its final dismemberment after the Battle for Atlanta. Perhaps one of its stongest features is its thorough coverage of the army's early days through the sacking of General Buell. It's a big canvas, and the story seems a bit rushed after the Battle of Chickamauga. Nevertheless, this study of the ""warhorse"" army of the West helps fill a big hole in Civil War literature!"
3,Does what it's supposed to do,This item is waaaaay over priced and only gives you a little more piece of mind. The lock and steel can easily be overcome by a determined thief (e.g. a hammer or lock cutter) but it does what it's supposed to do. I imagine that the unit cost for Thule on this product is less than $10 so they are clearly gauging their customers and will continue for as long as they can. If I had the tools I would recommend building your own or figure out a work around.
1,False sense of seurity,Thule makes exceptional products. This is not one of them. Use 3' length of chain or braided cable with a sturdy padlock to the frame of your hitch receiver assembly. This is a locking nut that can be easily broken or pryed off by a thief with simple tools.
4,Good knives,"I bought this set knowing that they were not expensive and were not top of the line. I have been extremely pleased with them. They work very well, and I'm pretty hard on knives."
5,The Album Speaks for Itself.,"The Album gives an excellant description of what God is: So Cool! I believe a lot of people get to hyped up and excited about God that they forget that He is a calm, cool, and down to earth person. Yes, there is a time too get excited about God and what He has done for us, but when making important decicons, I put on ""So Cool"", So that I might be able to think clearly, and make intelligent decisions about my life."
3,Cool Wallet but too thick........,"I was excited to try out this new wallet that was sure to turn heads but when I received it and transferred all my cards to it, it was clear that it was going to be just too thick for me. If you have four cards or less go for it! It's definitely a cool wallet but it was just too thick for me so I had to send it back."
2,"Mostly like a statue, not an action figure","Its arms are not very poseable. The outfit prevents legs from moving. One star less.Feet are bent sideways so it can't stand up on a flat surface on its own. So it needs the stand to stay up. 2 stars less, one for each bent foot.So in the end it is more like a statue. For hardcore collectors it may be just fine, in terms of nostalgia. But it is not a great action figure, more like a small statue. Face detail is good."
4,Best price anywhere,I been looking for a decent lanses for my minolta.. Looked everywhere and compare the prices. Amanzon.com has the cheapest price..
2,Still sitting in the closet...,"I bought these to store our Bob the Builder take along toys. Unfortunately, they're still sitting in the closet as both myself and my kids found them frustrating! The toys don't fit in them securely, and fall out as they're trying to close or open the case. It was easier to store them in a plastic shoebox!"
1,Not good.,"This movie is like all Sidaris' films...boring and silly. The only aspects that are not flat are the actresses. It's an article of faith among me and my friends that this guy only makes movies to give his stable of ""actresses"" an excuse to change into progressively revealing outfits; that faith is not shaken by this film. Granted, that's a lot of fun, but doesn't make for a very good movie. The absence of plot deters me from commenting upon it."
2,A Classic? for boys,"Marryat is a bit disappointing to me, after O'Brien, Lambden, Woodman, et al., but no doubt true to its time, when this story was a great favorite of young men who wanted to escape to sea. Mr. Easy has an entirely too easy time of life for a real midshipman under sail, full of successful derring-do without any visible training or sail-handling to it, but thanks really to his practical and experienced Negro servant! I can see how young boys might have enjoyed this fast-moving story of endless adventures when it was written 140 years ago, but for me it lacks grit, sweat, and tears (perhaps the very reason it successfully recruited boys into the navy, as Parascandola avers). Maybe this is a valuable historical document from a real sea captain, moralizing from an outlook lacking in the more ""politically correct, sensitive, and sexual"" attitudes of modern authors, but as the ""best"" of Marryat's novels, I'll pass on the others."
5,One of the best and most comprehensive books for communication theory,"It provides a thoughtful review of communication theories (both critical and effects tradition) starting with Shannon and Weaver to Internet studies. The book also provides a chapter in communication methods, media conglomerates, and regulations. Too much better and less biased than Media and Society of Crouteau and MediaMaking from Grossberg."
4,Wonderful and inspiring book,"I really enjoyed reading the personal accounts of two people on their spiritual paths who meet and discover that they are twin flames. This is a very down to earth, real portrayal of what Dennis and Alice went through and I felt very connected to them. I believe in Twin Flames and it helped me to see what needs to be done to be united with mine if that is my fate! I recommend this as a true love story and spiritual adventure."
2,Boring details and not much help,"This is isn't a ""how to"" book so don't expect any great hints on finding your own twin soul. Lots and lots of agonizing details in telling their story how they met, but little else..."
5,No more singed fingers!,This product is reasonably priced and facilitates the canning process.There is much to like about easily extracted lids. The lids are hot and separate. It is very easy to remove a lid from the rack.
5,Just like Grandma's!,"After canning several batches of jam with the magnetic stick, I found myself jealous of my grandma's lid rack. My scorched fingers are very grateful of this purchase. No more stuck together lids, trying to figure out where to put the magnet stick after burning my fingers prying the hot lid off of it, and no more dropped lids. If you can, you need one of these!"
3,Quality control anyone!?,"PoP is a great series of games which has come a long way (technically speaking). in many ways, you can't go wrong with any of the four games now out there. the focus on dexterity makes them fun in the spirit of the original. but The Two Thrones continues a theme that began with the sequel: a lack of attention to gameplay.The Two Thrones doesn't seem to have as many stranded-in-the-game bugs as The Warrior Within. it does, however, suffer terribly from the problem of rotating view and view-dependent movement. I've gotten so tired of dealing with the controls not keeping up with the orientation of the camera, that I've put the game down -- I just can't take it anymore!a few others: the Quick Kill feature is pretty contrived; hiding necessary life upgrades(!?); a really lame permanent weapon; and boring puzzles.I think I'm going to pull out my SNES and plug in the original."
1,Terrible game,"The third game offers nothing new or exciting enough to warrant a third visit to this series. Everything could've ended fine with the second one, but instead Ubisoft had to poop out another Prince of Persia game, in turn creating the least fun version of the series. Get Warrior Within or Sands of Time instead."
4,Heart Rate,"I was a little confused at first, but now I understand that the SportBrain 'Brain' can receive signals from a heart rate strap. This means it also collects heart rate data and now I can also check out my heart rate graphs and average for an activity. This is an excellent tool to help my training, the only thing lacking is a 'real time' read, but it is great to go back after a work out and be able to see my heart rate graph, all with out any wires or pushing any buttons or setting anything up."
3,Good ideas for beginners but way too thick,"The book and the corresponding website have many good tips for the beginning webpage designer. If you have been just looking for ideas by reading the HTML of websites, then this book will help you understand some of the design philosophy. However, be prepared to turn lots of pages because the information is spread kinda thin through this very thick book. The center section's color pages are very helpful to people who are just getting a feel for color coordination. I figure I learned about ten good basic principles but it took quite a lot of reading and page turning."
1,Full of typos and obsolete,"Big, long, with errors (not only typos, but actual HTML errors) and basically obsolete."
5,Ohhh Whew,This book had me hot as hell and I loved it! So did my husband. Everything in this book had me turning the pages like there was a prize at the end. I have told plenty of people about this book and they love it as well. Zane is doing her thang!
2,HOLD -ON !!!!!!!,WHEN I FIRST GOT THIS BOOK I WAS LIKE WHAT THE F*** BUT AFTER READING A LITTLE BIT OF IT I COULD NOT TEAR MYSELF AWAY FROM IT THIS WAS SOMETHING TO WIND DOWN TO IT KEPT ME WANTING TO READ MORE AND MORE EXCITING ALL THE WAY THROUGH I LOVED IT AND RECOMMEND ALL OF ZANE'S BOOKS TO ALL OF MY FRIENDS
3,ok,"This book ""Stagecoach to Hell"" is ok, hence my title, I have ead a lot of Giles A. Lutz's books and I had high expectations, but...this wasn't as good as most of his."
4,Surprisingly enjoyable,"Wasn't sure I'd like the subject matter..... Recently put an X in prison for molesting my daughters. I keep waiting for the plot to twist, clues are there. Almost finished reading...."
4,I love to read Jodi Picoult Books,"My goal is to read all of Jodi Picoult books. I have read Salem Falls, The pact, My Sisters Keeper, etc. I found Salem falls to be really interesting and I just could not put the book down. I usually love to read book that deal with historical fiction but these type of books are really good to read. I love to read the court cases and how they go. I love how they always have twist and turns and how she really entertains you with her characters. I really think Jodi Picoult is one of the best writers for whom I have read from!"
3,A Kosher Read,"I have read 3 of Picoult's novels and there is an ongoing court case/trial theme in each one. This doesn't bother me too much, but I do find myself wanting to skip pages sometimes just to see the end result.This book in particular was o.k. It was a bit hard to believe in some aspects that **SPOILER** Addie was gang raped, and then falls for a convicted rapist (albeit he was innocent of course.) I also knew, just from warning signs, that Gillian was having an incestuous relationship with her father. You don't really find out until the last paragraph of the book, but to me that fact was very predictable. I do wish that the author would have elaborated a bit more into what happens when Jack goes to NYC to see his mother. Does she forgive him?After finishing the book, some questions went unanswered and I was left with more questions."
2,Not her best work.,"I was a little bummed when I was reading Salem Falls. I love Jodi Picoult. I have read several of her books. I, like many others, was very disappointed in the book. It was not her best work. The four girls in the book are not even interesting. You can guess everything that happens. When I ready Change of Heart, My Sister's Keeper, Nineteen Minutes, Handle with Care, and Mercy, I read them in less then a week. With Salem Falls, I just am not even interested in it. I do like how descriptive the book is, like all of her books, but Salem Falls is just so uninteresting. I can not even finish the book. Off to a new one. If you are wanting to read Picoult books, do not start here. Start with one of the others that I have listed."
5,Jodi Picoult never disappoints.,"This story was riviting! Although I don't subscribe to Wiccan beliefs, this subplot added considerable depth and interest to the story. The trial captivated my interest, although the explanation of the DNA evidence was a bit too technical and confusing for the average reader to understand. I found the story hard to follow at times, especially in the beginning when I wasn't yet familiar with all the characters, because the scenes were very short and switched frequently between the parallel storylines. Rape was presented in a very sensitive manner from both the point of view of the victim and of the accused, and the two powerful themes of the story, that love can redeem a man and that lying has serious consequence, came through loud and clear. Kudos to the author for another wonderful story!"
3,Nothing special,"I was hoping for more from Jodi Picoult after reading her other books. This is a pedestrian plot with unremarkable characters and an outcome that is predictable. By the time I waded through to the end, I was skimming the pages to finish it. I didn't particulary like or dislike any of the characters and I found the plot lacked believable substance. I should have foreseen it when a recently-released prisoner was picked up by a cab driver and taken to an idyllic destination where he immediately melded into the landscape. I know that Picoult can do better and I am eagerly awaiting her next effort."
2,Disappointing,"I have read most of Jodi Picoult's books and could not wait to sink my teeth into this one. It was very difficult, for one, to get into the story. The book jacket tells you most of the story without turning a page. Secondly, I was really not interested in the characters. They seemed to be just that, superficial. Lastly, too much of the story was unbelievable."
4,A good read,"I read this book in bookclub. As soon as I finished it I handed it over to my mom to read. It grabs you right from the beginning, and is hard to put down until you are done. Not a great book, but very enjoyable to read."
2,Predictable and unrealistic,"I knew halfway into the book how it was going to end and hoped that I was wrong, that the writer wouldn't be that silly. But she did it.Lots of inconsistencies throughout, but the most ridiculous parts were the antics in the courtroom during a serious trial. First we were led to believe the judge was a no-nonsense kind of woman, but then she allows Roy to bring in muffins and sandwiches before giving his testimony.Also unrealistic was Addie living there quietly and peacefully with two of the men who had raped her. I didn't care much for Jack or Addie and found it hard to sympathize with Jack."
4,Kid Dynamaite Packs A Wallop!,"The story centers around Muggs and Bobby Jordan.Bobby fills in for Muggs at a boxing match and that's where the trouble starts. The film is fast, funny, and very entertaining. Huntz Hall and the rest of the gang are there too. Look for the scene with the dancing contest. It is very good! Leo Gorcey and Huntz Hall put on a good and hillarious dance act! This film is a winner!"
4,"So far, so good!","I bought this lens as a temporary replacement to the lens that came with the camera. And, so far, it has worked wonderfully!(though I've noticed the response a little slow on one shot - I hope it was a fluke!) ... The real test is coming in the next few weeks where I will be taking over 500 pictures over a 2 day period, If my opinion changes, then I'll EDIT this."
1,got the wrong book,"I thought I purchased the Trilogy for Hitchhikers Guide, as shown in the description, instead I only got book 3...a great book, but not all three"
3,Ho hum...,"This wasn't exactly the best book in the series. Though it contains perhaps the best scene in the entire trilogy (remember Agrahjag?) the humor is weak and hard to follw, the scenes with Zaphod and Trillian are inferior, and the ending is much too wierd. Arthur comes across best in this one, but it ends once again with the gang dropping him off. Don't try it. It's not healthy."
2,A step in the wrong direction,"Life, the Universe and Everything, book 3 in the hitchhikers trilogy (which actually has FIVE books)was quite different than the first two. While the first books had lighthearted yet well developed plots, the plot in LUE (Life the Universe and Everything)was darker, less well developed and very unorigonal (I mean come on, saving the universe is so passe). I was also very disappointed with the humor. While it had its moments, LUE had fewer humorous portions and most of the humor seemed very out of context and had nothing to do with the plot. The ending was also very anti-climactic, not having a cliffhanger like the previous boooks. Overall it is a dissapointment compared to the rest of the series but is neccessary to read to get the whole plot of the series. I recommend it to only those who are going to read the rest of the series."
5,how much can you really say about genius?,"Arthur Dent, Ford Perfect, and a few of their--for lack of a better word--friends find themselves in a mission to save the universe from the crazed genocidal world of Kirkkit (homophone intended). Adams' comic-science-fiction series continues to be a marvel of imagination, hilarity, and perfect prose. A glorious read. Grade: A+"
4,Nice Charm!,Nice charm for a bracelet. The size will go well with other charms; not too large and not too small.
4,Dizon puts the IRA front and center,"Dizon has written an interesting work about an important subject, a fictional account of the breakout of peace in northern Ireland. The dialogue is convincing, the action pell-mell, and the plot suspenseful. Dizon is at his best conveying the ethnic patois of the combatants, and, from various clues, it is clear that he has ""been there, done that."" His choice of title is also intriguing, the tiara of the chief protagonist -- an English princess (and most decidedly not the one who arrogantly dismissed the Irish as p*gs) who does a Patty Hearst when abducted by the IRA - becomes instead a crown of thorns as her fame and status as royalty become a burden. While varied in style, Tiara is conceptually solid, and a timely and valuable book."
2,WII Remote skin green,"The skin went on fine and worked great til the kids had to change the batteries. It tore trying to get it back on. I ordered 3 of these in different colors and it broke on the first 2. The price was great, I think they should have lasted longer."
2,"No Tech Support, WormNet Down, Anti-Climatic","Worms World Party is a great game. The new interface is too bright, and it's exactly like Armageddon - but it's great!HOWEVER-- You are supposed to be able to play online - but it never works! There is virtually no tech support for Americans. Interplay is supposed to be handling the technical support but they haven't answered any of my emails in the last two weeks.This product is not being distributed properly."
4,Up and back with a few new twists.,"R.E.M.'s cheerfully titled new drummerless album brings some great new songs to the already great library of R.E.M. tunes. It has a strange but comforting feel throughout the album, and it may take a little getting used to, but all in all it's a definate keeper. It starts off with a space wondering Airportman and keeps the same type of feel throughout the album, just kind of out there. Soothing songs such as ""At My Most Beautiful"", ""Suspicion"", and ""Sad Professor"" make you just want to pile on some blankets and relax. 'Hope"" is a cheerfull song that reminds me of ""Wishlist"" by Pearl Jam, it has no chorus and just kind of travels. ""Parkakeet"" has a churchlike feel to it. ""Daysleeper"" is one of R.E.M.'s best song to date that fits the feel to the album beautifully. R.E.M. finsihes the album with a great closer, ""Falls to Climb"". The album takes a little getting used to, but it's another great R.E.M. album."
3,Click...Click...Click,"I liked this, but I'm not sure I'd ever want to see it again. If it wasn't Adam Sandler, I woundn't have seen it in the first place. The humor is okay, if infrequent. I'm not sure if ""campy"" is the right word, but it is what comes to mind."
2,under-developed and over-hyped,"The funny parts were all in the 60 second TV commercials- and they were funny, but there wasn't that much more for comedy. The plot was reasonable and had the similarities to classics others have pointed out.The PG-13 was really pushing it. With the exception of full nudity, it had all the elements of an R. I only mention this if you were going to watch it w/ your kids. I've been into bars that had shadow-box dancers and this was similar.I almost gave it one star, but there were a few good scenes."
3,Last 1/4 of the movie saved it,"I was struggling to keep this movie on throughout the first half of the movie. I won't lie. It was bland, predictable, and just NOT entertaining in the least. However, the last 1/3 to 1/4 of the movie absolutely saved the picture for me. When the remote began randomly fast forwarding on him, the movie began to take on a different kind of role. It became an eye-opening film, in a way. Not a movie that would blow you away, but certainly one that will make you 2nd guess how you are currently living your life, and you may shed a tear or two in the process.The previews for this movie made me think it was going to be a slapstick comedy. Although it did have a few LOL moments, overall, especially towards the end, it was more dramatic than a full fledge comedy.It's worth seeing if you're a Sandler fan."
2,misleading,this movie is rated pg13...should be rated r..contains suggestive sexual content and suggestive sexual language..i would not have bought this movie based on a pg13 rating..appparently pg13 is almost r rating
2,A dreary melodrama marketed as a comedy [2.5 stars],"Don't watch Click if you're in the mood for a light-hearted comedy. The middle of the film is miserable. Of course, it has a Hollywood happy ending. The comedy bits are OK but few and far between. If Click had been marketed as a drama, this would be less of a problem.The story line has some great life lessons. Without giving away too much, the morals of this movie are: 1. put family first; 2. don't wish your life away, but enjoy every minute of it, even the mundane. For driving home those lessons, Click has some value. It is also great to see Adam Sandler do well in a dramatic role. He has more range than you might imagine.But there's something very unsatisfying about watching Click that's not fixed by the sugar-coated ending or the few bits of Sandler-esque pranks and smartass jokes. In short, it's a mediocre film."
5,"A ""What If"" Movie","For me the movie tries to convey the idea of ""Family"" and what's important in ones life (ie family). I didn't find it to be a real comedy, compared to others from Adam, but nontheless I really liked this movie."
3,TYPICAL ADAM SANDLER.....,"This movie is kind of cute in its own Adam Sandler goofy-immature-kind of way. The ending may even have you in tears? Its worth seeing, but maybe wait til its out on DVD....."
4,Familiar Story - Family vs Work,"Adam Sandler did a fine job, as the harried father, who wants to have more time to spend with his family, but his work gets in the way. I thought of the movie, ""Multiplicity"" which has a different solution to the same problem. Christopher Walken is wonderful as the oddball character who can solve his problem. This was a good story with some surprising twists."
1,Didn't do anything for me,"This came so highly recommended that I could be expecting the impossible from it but... I used it on all of my plants and saw no improvement at all; healthy, middling or failing, all continued on their way. I would not recommend this, it is a waste of money."
2,Did not help Coastal Redwoods,"I can't say whether Superthrive is good or bad, but it certainly did not help with our in door plants, including two Coastal Redwoods about 2-years old which completely died soon after trying this."
5,Plants Get a Boost for Growth,"Superthrive is an awesome product! We had a great deal of blowdown after a winter storm, and one of my favorite ornamental flowering trees split in half. I took clippings from the part of the tree that we had to remove, and treated the remaining stump with a mixture of warm water and Superthrive. The clippings were dipped directly in the hormone, and then placed in sand and covered. Within a couple of weeks, the clippings are doing well and showing signs of rooting. The surviving stump has sprung back and is growing new buds. I was very impressed with this product."
5,fantastic,"plain and simple, it works. this is why it is patented and has been around for so many years. I used this about 8 years ago on a new tree i planted when i purchased my house and compared to the other new houses in the neighborhood, my tree is twice as big as other planted at the same time. Now i am using this at my new house on my new flower gardens as well as tomato plants. I cannot speak for the tomatoes since i am also using Jobe's fertilizing spikes but as far as the plants, you can see MUCH deeper colors and more vibrant flowers. I would recommend this all day long"
5,"It's Alive, it's alive","I love Superthrive and have loved it for years. I found out about this product from the girls who watered the plants in our office. Every since then my plants have ""thrived"". I couldn't find Superthrive in the stores in NM so that is why I ordered it. Apparently in NM the label has to be different than other states; same product just NM friendly. I would recommend this to anyone, especially those without a green thumb."
5,AWESOME,FIRST TIME USING.. LOVE IT JUST DO NOT MIX STRONG... 10 DROPS TO A GALLON OR 1/4 tsp per 5 GALLONS OF WATER IS WHAT I MIX AND SEE A DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE.. TRIED 1/4 tsp TO A GALLON WAS TO STRONG PLANTS ALMOST DIED..
2,Maybe a bad batch??,"Well i have used other fertilizer, food, and other additives in the past and had always had pretty good results but for some reason this stuff sis not work at all. It had allot of accolades and promise, but did nothing for my tomatoes. In the past using other methods, i did yield more tomatoes than i could use, so IDK im hoping I just bought an old or bad bottle since I bought it from Walmart. Im sure Ill try it again, this time ill buy it from my favorite online store, AMAZON WHOOP WHOOP!! then ill update. In a few months"
1,No benefit...,"I will post again if i notice anything good coming out of thisbut it has been a week and the plant that was dying is now dead. And the rest seem to be the same or in worse shape! D-:@ G. RaringLearn how to not jump to conclusions as they make you seem idioticI didnt mention that i followed the instructions, but the lack of me stating it is no proof that i didnt read the label (much less know how to do so)"
2,Read Before You Purchase Superthrive!,"The short review is that I believe it is the best fertilizer on the market. It is nearly impossible to lose a plant when using Superthrive. The big BUT....Because the company chooses not to manufacture the product with a spillproof opening, the same amount of liquid (or more) that you pour into a measuring device, runs down the side of the bottle. I've purchased every size, and it happens with all. When ordering, figure that you will be getting half of what you order. Superthrive is expensive in the first place; losing half of what you pour makes it astronomically expensive! There are plenty of good fertilizers that are easy to use. I prefer Superthrive for quality, but because of the waste, I'll be using another product."
3,time will tell,The nutrition product for plants was highly recommended to me. It is easy to use. I am trying it and will see in a month or so whether it is good for my house plants which have never been fertilized!
3,Beautiful Movie,"""Snow Flower and the Secret Fan"" is a lovely movie about a friendship that surpasses time, love, and all understanding. It's simple, but beautifully crafted. I think it will leave viewers wishing that they all had a friendship this unconditional."
2,Not as good as the book,I read the book a while ago and the movie is a disappointment. I missed it the movies but I am kind of glad that I didnt spend money to watch it on the big screen. I watched in the comfort of home on DVD and it was very boring. I am sorry not to give this movie a better review but I love Lisa See's book tremendously and this movie does not do the book justice.
4,BOOK VS FILM NONSENSE,"Once again Wang delivers an exceptionally beautiful film. Does he know how to use color or what ? The last time I saw color used this beautifully was in the film ""El Norte"". This is a real and touching story and is in fact quite different from the book. But it's not a book folks. IT'S A MOVIE. A movie is a director's realm and the director has the creative license to create an entirely new story or to adapt, create, or change from a novel, an idea, a short story, a painting or any other art form. Please, try to remember that a film is not a book. It is a photographic creation. To criticize a film because it is different from it's literary inspiration is as ridiculous as criticizing a movie based on historical events if it deviates from historical facts. If you want a book or historical facts go to the library not the cinema."
5,Top-notch Schumann.,"Pamela Ross may not be a big name, but she takes a back seat to no one in her interpretation of these two great works. Outstanding."
3,Fantastic Soundtrack - POOR Quality MP3 Conversion!,"The movie is in my opinion a masterful piece of work by Roman Polanski and his choice of musical composer was inspired - so reader, please know I'm a fan.However the present (June 2011) MP3s available here are in places distorted and not as clear as I have heard elsewhere, still nice to have but wouldn't have bothered paying here for the poor quality :o("
3,a fresh voice,"Vicenza is a new arrival in the land of the free...and she's not exactly loving it. After having to leave her wealthy home in Manila for questionable reasons, she's having a hard time adjusting. Her parents are totally clueless, and so obviously immigrants. No one at her school will talk to her, and she has to struggle to keep up her grades for her scholarship. Vicenza has one friend, a quicky french girl who is an outcast just like her. Between working for her parents all the time and school, V has no life. Then she starts crushing on one of the most popular guys around. V sends emails full of lies about her""fabulous"" life to her pals back home. On top of everything, the big formal is coming up, and V has the ugliest dress and the biggest loser for a date. Will V overcome her ""fresh off the boat"" status and adjust to life in America?"
5,Sometimes you read excellent reviews...,"and get a so-so product but this dvd is GREAT!pros - perfect pace for practicing along with, background info, excellent demonstration and explanation of techniques, hundreds of techniques to choose from, great price, great production quality (sound, picture...), navigation feature (you can skip through techniques)Now there is no routine per se, for 60 or 90 minute Thai Massages, but I already knew this because the description says that. This should not be a problem at all. Creating your own routine is ridiculously easy when Richard gives you all the information and demonstrations you could possibly need.I highly recommend this dvd."
5,"Israel's history, a very significant sample!","In this book, Amos Oz tells the story of his family, the convergence of several different countries and cultures into one man.He describes precisely the mentality of the immigrants to Israel, the way the Arab/Jewish relationship changed with the creation of the State of Israel, and the formation of the Israeli people.The book is hypnotic, it is hard to read it slowly, and dozens of stories are interlinked leaving no sewing signs. He narrates Israeli history and personal life as one.The title is very accurate in representing the story. His life was surrounded by strong and controversial figures, which make a rich camp for enlightening insights by the author."
3,KING SOLOMON's MINES,Afraid I was not very pleased with DVD packaging the plastic box to the DVD was all stuck up with Security tags which has left it all sticky hence I have to find another box and The DVD picture cover itself was stuck with selotape which took some of the picture off.I like my DVD's to be in mint condition if I buy brand new ones. I should have sent it back but did not want the hassle of posting back.The supplier needs to be aware of these points.
4,King Solomon's Mines,To review this movie is to look at it from the view of a tongue-in-cheek or spoof of the original King Solomon's Mines made earlier with Stewart Granger and Deborah Kerr. I don't know whether it was meant to be but if you look at it from that viewpoint I think it was hilariously funny {particularly the first half}. I had never seen Richard Chamberlain's funny side before {although I know he has a great sense of humor} and he played it very well. Sharon Stone was a little giggly but good and John Rhys-Davies always plays a wonderfull villan. The last part was a bit unreal but followed somewhat in the same humorous vein. All in all it was a fun movie to watch.
2,Petmate Large Kennes is not so large,"This is not a bad product overall; however, describing it as large is very misleading. It is tiny; maybe ok for a dog under 16 lbs but that's it. As the result, we could only use it for 2 weeks before our puppy grew out of it. Also, the handle is attached loosely and comes off easily which makes it hard to carry."
4,Spiral Tarot,"I instantly fell in love with the Spiral Tarots as soon as I saw them. They're very feminine and i love the different shades and colours used. I'm new to Tarot cards, but I beleive I made the right choice choosing this deck as my first."
5,Absolutely gorgeous.,"This deck is awesome. The symbolism is close to the standard Waite type, but the artwork has been improved a great deal. The Major Arcana cards are the nicest I've come across. The Minor Arcana are simpler, and look like the artist didn't spend as much time on them, but they are still very good. I found it very easy to read these cards; in fact I'd recommend not using the little interpretation booklet at all. The cards are that intuitive. If you like this one, you might also like the Robin Wood deck, which is similar but with a different style of drawing. Both are easy to read and have beautiful artwork."
4,cells over systems,"I'm a biopsychologist. Kalat is a very good writer with a gift for explaining difficult concepts and for keeping technical issues interesting. I chose his Intro Psych book for my classes for just this reason. My response to this book is a little more mixed. Biopsychology ranges broadly from cellular to systems level research. This book does well at the former level. It gets a little more deeply into the biochemistry than I would prefer but does so well and is impressively up to date. It does less well at the systems level literature. For example, it defines two common imaging terms incorrectly: PET and rCBF (mixing them up with SPECT and PET respectively). Overall, I like the book and chose it for my biopsychology class but every instructor needs to choose based on their own needs for depth and for emphasis."
3,5 Stars for Cavender is Coming,"If this had just been Cavender is Coming I would have given it five stars. I loved the episode, Cavender is Coming. It may be yet another story with a not so perfect angel and a diamond in the rough human, but the twist is delightfully quaint even if you do see it coming. You want to see it through. Carol Burnett's subtle genius was just as much there then as it is now. The Jack Benny like qualities to the angel are well placed. There's nothing better than a hero who can find Heaven in Hell and to be able to show that to an angel...? Agnes is and always will be my hero. I wish they would sell this episode without the other two."
3,Oscillating Edge Sander,"My new sander is good for the money. The oscillation method itself is not what I expected. Better machines have a mechanism that enables more movement up and down by gears under the table. The method used on this one is a tilting action on the pulley that simply changes the tracking of the belt a bit. The dust control connection must be removed for large inside radius sanding using the end drum, as well as for a belt change. An inconvenience I was trying to avoid by upgrading to this model. It does do the job though for most applications."
4,Catholic Etiquette,I was very pleased with the book. It helped me to understand what is going on and I didn't feel that everyone was watching me.
1,I have books on this subject and I found this one over-,I have many books on this subject and I found this one over-simplified and poorly done when it came to images and ideas.
3,Nice looking wedge,"This shoe seems to run a little bit narrow to me so if you have wide feet it may not fit or get the next bigger size. I wanted a unique color, something other than black/brown and the purple and blue colors are really nice."
4,I'm Still a Big Fan,"I think that Ms. Files really spoiled me with the lives of Reesy and Misty from ""Scenes From a Sistah"" and ""Getting to the Good Part"" - my all time favorite being ""Scenes...""! I guess maybe that's why I wasn't as ""in to"" this novel as I was with the others.Don't get me wrong, it was a good novel, it just wasn't a ""Can't put down"" type of book. The characters were truly HOLLYWOOD (smile) and I also enjoyed the bit of mystery that Ms. Files added to the story. I kept going back and forth with who Alisha's mother was (especially since everybody seemed to be getting those mysterious hang-ups) - but when I found out - I kinda felt like I was left hanging - I really wanted to see something else happen.Overall, thanks Ms. Files for another novel and please, please bless us with another Reesy and Misty story!!"
3,"Good, but not very deep","I liked this story, but it didn't really live up to the promise of the prologue. I would have liked to see a little more character development; I didn't feel like I knew them that well. With so many major characters, this book could have been a lot longer. Maybe the author was going for the breezy summer read; I don't know.One thing I absolutely loved was the surprise about the identity of the girl in the prologue! I did not see that coming, and I'm usually good at predictions."
3,STARTED OFF KIND OF SLOW BUT PICKED UP.....,This is the first book that I read by Ms Files and I received this one for my bookclub to review last week in the mail. It started off kind of slow but once the story line got going I became more and more interested in what was going to happen next. I love the characters. This book is a great pick up.. I do have the other 2 books at home so I will have to add Ms Files as one of my authors to keep up with.
2,The literary shell game,"It would be appropriate to simply state ""move on, there's nothing to see here,"" however I will not heed my own advice. There is little to distinguish this offering from anything currently out there from Tyree, Harris, Dickey, George, Williams and I hazard to assume a host of others I have not encountered. Frankly, BLIND AMBITIONS could have comfortably fit as the much anticipated sequel to Tyree's FLYY GIRL, in fact, it should have but that's another review.I'm not presumptuous enough to expect each developing writer to explore brand new territory but I do expect them to at least plant independent footsteps in the terrain.I rate it two stars as it is not unreadable, it simply fails to present characters or ideas that can be delineated from the voluminous works of her contemporaries."
3,"Imani Book Club Review - Montgomery, AL","We found this book to be a very quick read. The novel reminded us of the Jackie Collins' books about the shallowness of Hollywood life. One of the main strengths of this novel is that the story kept you guessing until the very end. Some of us liked the midilogues and some of us didn't because we found them confusing. Since this book reminded us of the Hollywood novels by Collins, it is fair to say the story was shallow and offered little redeeming qualities. The characters were not well developed and some of us found the story seemed rushed at the end. However, the author does provide a strong message: Ambition is key to anything you want to accomplish.Although, this was not our favorite File's story it provided something quick to read and gave us an opportunity to escape for a little while from our everyday lives. The book club looks forward to our second novel on our syllabus this year by Files."
3,Not as good as I thought,Just not as good as I thought it would be considering it's size. I have a much smaller more conventional baseboard heater (they don't make anymore) that uses the same or less energy and feels like double the heat and it doesn't have a blower either (and a few years ago it was free with a purchase of some other item not much more expensive than this heater.) Quality seems good and well built just not enough output.
3,half and half,"The scores on this are fantastic, chateau and overdrive are the two best songs on this album with session by linkin park in a close second........other than that, nothing really stands out. the manson song is horrible, and i'm a fan of his music usually. the rob zombie song is typical rob zombie, loud and hard, nothing special. if you like those bands and good techno, it would be a wise purchase.....but in the end i'm wanting for more because of the incredible first album"
2,More Instrumental Please!,"I love movie soundracks. They comprise at least 10% of my personal music.The intro by Linkin Park and the 4th track by Rob Dougan are excellent and powerful.However, I won't buy this soundtrack. It will be another example I'll use in my ongoing quest to ""voice"" my preference for instrumental music.I intensely dislike these particular Marilyn Manson & Rob Zombie tracks for their use of language and tone of voice, though I have enjoyed both artists work in the past. Granted there are other singers with talent on the disk, but the overall effect shows that more and more often, music is being cranked out simply to meet expectations of production/merchandising with only a fleeting glace at quality.I admit I'm impressed that we could get two CDs for the price of one, but again its quantiy over quality in order to sell.Thanks anyway."
5,always amazing,"Well, i do not need to say this album is one of the best. The sound quality is amazing and i am very happy with it."
2,went and died,"If it hadn't died after just one day of use, it might have been OK, although far from great. The interface takes some figuring out and getting used to, but is not quite the nightmare other reviewers of MacVision players have complained about. The earbuds with the neck lanyard are impractical - looks and feels like wearing a cowbell. The thing is bulkier than you'd think. Gave me a good run on one battery though. Returning it and getting me a nano, what the heck."
4,Needs tape,"The ring that fits around the umbrella pole was too big, even after using the tape included with the set. I had to go to the hardware store to buy double-sided tape to fill the gap. Set works and looks great! Prepare to be patient with the installation of all the clips."
1,Fell apart within 2 minutes,"I have a young mini rex who gave one tug on the doorway within 2 minutes of me putting him in the carrier, and the zipper popped off the track. Another tug, and the second zipper came off. Spent the remainder of the 1hr ride in the car holding the door shut with one hand (while driving stick). Was also incredibly tight for a small bunny - he could barely turn around - and this is a 4 lb MINI rabbit.Spend the extra $5 and get a hard plastic pet carrier."
5,MAGICAL!,"I loved this book with it's artwork, text, and comprehensive handling of faeries. The treatment of the ""species"" was also consistent with other sources I have read. Faeries are not of human origin and therefore do not maintain the same behaviors or values that many would like to project on them. The author's handling of encounters, cooperation, and offenses against faeries was insightful. There is good reason to avoid encounter with these creatures.Those that criticize this book for its realistic approach have not read far. This subject is not for children as the characters are not gossimer cuddlies but self-centered, manipulative, unpredictable beings. If readers are disenchanted by this book, they should also avoid delving into the subject of angels."
5,Absolutely Beautiful,This is the most incrediable book I have ever had the pleasure of reading. The illustrations are so beautiful and the details are amazing. I love the writing and this is one of my favorite books to look through when im in a fantasy kind of mood. Recommend this to everyone adn anyone. Who cares if some of the figures are naked? Naked is beautiful and all this art is wonderful.
4,Not bad!!,"I'm a lover of all things faery, so this was definitely down my alley! The pictures were great, and the information was wonderful. I learned quite a bit by reading this book... and it had a beautiful layout. Great job. :)"
4,An interesting and unique product.,"Being from the UK, I'm well familiar with Billy Connolly, and his stand up comedy, and his travels round various parts of the world.However, his music in this band is less well known (other than he was in a band called the Humblebums in college, and that he plays the banjo)...so for those who want a taste of authentic, I guess Gaelic, folk music as done by Billy and his band, then this is a unique and interesting double disc set.I bought this from the US store because it was a gift for a friend in NYC, who said he thoroughly enjoyed it, even though he didn't know Billy Connolly that well."
1,Boring,This is not reggae. This some hasidic jew whining and saying oogi yoi over and over again.Not worth it...
5,Amazon should carry more Matiyahu/JDub records,"This cd is awesome. If you already own 'Shake off the dust ... Arise,' this addition will not be redundant. Matisyahu mixes up his previous songs and releases a few new ones on this album. Unfortunately, if you are looking for more, you will have to go to JDub directly. My only criticism is that I didn't know Amazon carried this until recently. I hope Amazon builds on this selection with more from Matisyahu and JDub."
5,Great Reggae,"This the perfect mix of Reggae and modern Rock, despite it being sang by a Hadistic Jew. Many songs are quite deep and dynamic.Particularly the song ""King without a Crown"", with continual changes breaking out into parts that song that is similar to rock while others parts sound like classic reggae, is very good and deep. ""The Warrior"" too is very good, too. It sounds like classical reggae.If you like reggae music I strongly encourage you to buy this album. It is very dynamic and quite Spiritual."
5,"Uplifting, Enthralling!!","Having lived in Jamaica and being raised in the Caribbean, I am very discerning when it comes to reggae and the message it delivers . I first heard of Matisiyahu a few months ago and bought the CD to check him out. It blew my mind!! This guy is deep into what the believes and sings from the soul, he really means what he sings. Very appealing message and lyrics, even if you are not religious or want to understand Hasid or just groove to cool reggae rhythms, this is a must have. Too bad I missed ""Matis"" when he came to DC's 6th Street Synagogue (yeah, a concert at the Schul). Matisyahu's music and the band really pack a punch."
4,Live at Stubbs,"Descent CD to put on while people are over, very chill with some upbeats on a fair amount of tracks.CD is a CD-ROM that plays a live video for King Without A Crown. Can't wait to see him live!"
5,Jeff Turmes did it again !,"Jeff Turmes is a multitalent recording artist ! Great songs , ultimateplayers.If you want groove , get this one !elain"
1,don not buy,"these plates are extremely thin, and would not hold anything besides a few pieces of fruit - the feel and look cheap in my opinion though their priceis not on the lower end. I returned mine to amazon and had to find other plates for my event."
4,Good album,"I still think Headstones was their best album but, this one rocks.P.S. They are from Sweden, I probably know because the drummer is my cousin."
4,Loved it!,"I was a bit hesitant with this CD, given how wonderful his first one. But I love it! ""Table for Two"" is banging and is definitely my favorite song on the whole CD. Joe is very talented!"
2,A Total Disappointment!,"I loved Joe's last album ""All That I Am"" -- but this one was a total disapointment. After waiting patiently for this album to be released -- I am sorry that I spent my money on this cd. Joe has a beautiful voice -- only if he had spent time using it on the right songs. The best two songs on this album are ""I want to Know"" and the remix with Mariah Carey - ""Thank God I Found You."" I hope his next album will be better than this one."
4,His best album so far,"After much anticipation of his third album, Joe has made a comeback. With his smooth vocals and meaningful lyrics, this is an album definitely worth the wait. With collaberations with Mariah Carey, Nas and N sync, Joe shows his ability to work with artists of various styles. This album, has proved that Joe is just as talented as all the other RnB stars at the top."
3,Sad and unsatisfied,I was very unhappy to receive this Cd. It arrived fairly quickly but I was greatly disappointed when i attempted to listen to it because there are three different places where it skips and drags. I am unsatisfied and very disappointed with this purchase
4,Great re-telling of the Arthurian story,"This book was great in that it was different from many of the other King Arthur tales I have read. For the first time I was able to like Guenevere, because she wasn't portrayed as a helpless and religious fanatic. I loved how Gwen's and Lancelot's relationship was handled, as well as the relationship between Mordred and everyone else. Another nice thing was that the quest for the Holy Grail wasn't really a part of the story at all. This let the author focus on many of the other important and interesting aspects of the Arthur stories.I recommend this book to anyone even remotely interested. But I also HIGHLY recommend The Mists of Avalon by Marion Zimmer Bradley. No Arthurian legends reading list is complete without that book. It is THE book to read if you're interested in anything King Arthur."
2,An Anthetical Take on Human Nature,"Reading the many reviews in praise of Proust's estremical opus, I must wonder if readers are confusing quantity with quality. Though one must admire Proust's sheer anthenticity, the work seems to rely more on the complexity of the narrative than it does the power of the actual writing. Much like Faulkner, Proust capitalizes on his sentuplative talent for description, which is admittedly stunning. Even in translation, Proust's prose retains is almost ethereal quality. However, Proust proselytize so long on everything from his childhood bed to his lover's eyes that any beauty in the language is lost. Once the reader has been stripped the illusion that skillful use of language must convey some profound insight, they are left to face the grim, hackneyed subject matter: once careless bon vivant realizes the emptiness of his ways. The work is not one of literature, but of self-flagellation."
5,LOVED this book,"I read 'One Child' 30 years ago and still carry the image of Sheila around in my heart. Her story is truly touching and is partly the reason why I pursued a degree in psychology in college. 'Tiger's Child' gave me some of the answers to 'what happened to sheila?' but only left me wanting more. Torey Hayden needs to give us updates on ALL of her students, if possible. Get writing, Torey!!"
4,Clean AIr,Fits perfectly it is really a great way to buy your car service parts and not have to worry about your car repairs constantly.
1,Got one FREE from Staple and It's NOT worth $45,"Got one free with $150 order from Staple. The major problem with this player is that no matter how many songs you upload to the player, it can only play first 10 songs. Sometime, it just hang so I have to take the battery out to turn the unit off. You can buy something better if you pay just little bit more. I gave this unit to my 5 year old."
5,Great gift!,"My daughter had this book when she was younger, but it somehow got ""lost"". Even though she's in college, she wanted to have a copy of one of her favorite books. Thanks."
3,Light fun for Cusack fans,"While not in the same league as his other movies from the era (Better Off Dead, One Crazy Summer, and The Sure Thing), this one is still a fun and entertaining movie.Cusack was great as the offbeat, loser teen trying to get the classy girl - and that's what he's up to here.It's silly, fun, and still makes me laugh."
4,Fun movie !,John Cusack's early movie and it is a good one. The director Steven Lisberger also directed Tron in 82. The performace is fine and the movie is quite funny every step of the way. Robert Loggia Co-stars.The DVD is quite good. The picture is sharp and exotic locations are presented beautifully in this DVD. Too bad Paramount did not remastered the sound in 5.1 but the sound quality is adequate. Recommended.
4,Hot Pursuit,"I bought it for my boyfriend. He couldn't find it anywhere and was dying to see it again. We both enjoyed it. It's an fun,easy to watch movie. Its fun to see Ben stiller so young in a movie. Jerry Stiller, John Cusack and the father from There's something about Mary are great in it too.. He said it was a great birthday present. If you like older movies like Weekend at Bernies, you'll like this."
1,Not worth your money,"I bought this machine for my daughter as her first machine. It doesn't have a bobbin, and therefore doesn't create a stitch. The first piece of fabric we tried bunched and made odd stitches that came out. It was frustrating and disappointing. My boys liked the sound of the machine, and thought it was fun to push the peddle... Not what I envisioned this machine being used for! I finally took the batteries out and threw it away. If you want a first machine, look for something with a little more umph. This one isnt' it."
5,"Warm, engaging, and informative book!","Beautifully photographed and engagingly written, this is a thoughtful portrayal of the Mayan people presented as a day-in-the-life, and focusing on a lifestyle where hands still do the work (instead of dishwashers, food processors, etc!) It would be a wonderful gift book for a young child, or a great classroom supplement for a pre-K through 2nd grade class focusing on the Americas, community, indigenous peoples... or even the human body!"
5,Gorgeous and LARGE!,"This is largest undermount sink I could find under $300, and I was not disappointed! It is really, really big and amazon had an awesome price on it. I like big sinks because I have a very oversized vanity and a normal sink would have looked too small in proportion. I would recommend it to anyone so long as you needs something quite large."
2,A Disappointment,"This crime novel has quite a reputation among hardboiled aficianados, but I'm not sure I see why. We follow Fell, a gambling boss, as he checks himself out of a mental sanitarium, regains the power he was in danger of losing, and then goes over the top into manic psychosis. Kill is well-written and believable, but it's not very entertaining, or even very interesting. Part of the problem, I think, is the cold, clinical tone -- it feels more like a psychiatric case study than a novel. The other part of the problem is that there's no one to root for in the book: we never care about Fell, so ultimately we don't care what happens to him. That could have been dealt with if the book was more racy/lurid -- one would read on just to have one's sensibilities shocked -- but this is so quiet, it only manages to inspire indifference. Don't bother hunting this one down, and don't believe the hype."
2,Outdated,"Basically, this book may be distilled down into a few statements (below). The examples used are from the late 1950's, and not in touch with the culture of 2007.**The work expands to fill the time available.**People will attempt to hire more subordinates regardless of workload.**Large committees will spend more time arguing over small line item expenses they understand, as opposed to huge expenditures they don't.**Have two issue supporters sit next to and kibitz an undecided yahoo -- this will sway the yahoo into voting their way.**Approximately five - eight people are the ideal number to run a huge endeavor.**The best want-ad will only be answered by one (qualified) person.**Rich men avoid taxes.**Younger people force older conservatives to retire.If you are interested in Parkinson's Law, I'd suggest buying a later edition with examples more in tune with modern computerized business. This older edition is for collector's and has limited business value."
5,If you're not hooked on lieder yet . . .,I had never owned so much as a single lieder on CD before I bought this album. Now I am hooked. The only problem is that I cannot find any other recording that comes anywhere close to this one in terms of quality. Fischer-Dieskau's singing is emotional and evocative; Gerlad Moore's piano playing subtle and understated. I HIGHLY recommend this recording to anyone with an even passing interest in classical vocal music.
2,No texts,"How can you judge a performance when a CD contains no texts? Unless your command of German is excellent (mine is just fair) you will not understand the words. The singer may or may not be doing justice to the poems -- you won't be able to tell. Given that the texts come from the best German poets, this is just a shame."
3,stereo mix...same technique as SGT PEPPER,"All I can really say is....If you like this stereo mix....You will probably like SGT PEPPER and MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR as well....it isn't that hokey ""music-left/vocals-right"" wannabe stereo that I have been ragging about....This is actually listenable and enjoyable....The remastering job is pretty good....The packaging is a real treat...If you want to hear The Beatles in the way THEY wanted to be heard....then you need to grab the MONO BOX SET...it blows this away...hands down!!I would say....All in all...it's worth the investment...if just for the booklet and outer jacket."
5,Oh my god you people!,"this album is the goodness of happiness.The ideas for this album has brought forth new styles for the heart and soul of modern music. This album also transformed alot of rock music. Just listen to ""And Your Bird Can Sing"", or ""Eleanor Rigby."" If the beatles didn't exist, there wouldn't be a lot of good rock."
2,Revolver - Hardly the Mona Lisa,"Without doubt the most overrated easy listening album of all time. Taxman has a great bass line, and And Your Bird Can Sing reaches back to the great sound of the early Beatles. That's it.The rest is so dated, I can hardly see how this album changed music forever. The Beatle albums that changed music were the early ones - A Hard Day's Night, Help, etc.Music has made a lot of progress from these orchestra-backed easy listening songs. In fact, this was almost a step back."
1,The Beatles' worst album.,"Revolver is the Beatles' weakest album, worse than Yellow Submarine.It displays poor production by George Martin and superficial songwriting, although George's contributions are far better than John's. Ringo's influence is felt strongly on this album. Revolver does the Beatles' reputation irreparable damage, and it was also their least influential work. A candidate for the worst album of all time by any artist."
2,Revolver,"I read where ""Here There and Everywhere"" was Paul's attempt to write a song as good as ""God Only Knows"" by Brian Wilson on Pet Sounds. I'd say that the word ""attempt"" accurately describes the effort. Who knows, maybe someone will ""re-produce"" it one day to change the song to their taste.As for the rest of this album, Taxman stands out the most."
2,Correction,"No, it's not one of the most influential albums ever. No, it's not one of the Beatles' best. No, every song is not fabulous; in fact, a minority of the songs are truly insightful and this doesn't include Tomorrow Never Knows. Actually, George provides the best song. Overall, nearer the bottom the Beatles barrel. Focus on the earlier non-drug induced albums."
2,Help!,"Hey, why can't we sample the 30 second clips here like with all the other music on Amazon?Does somebody think The Beatles music is too good to be heard without paying for it first?Musical Communism!I want to hear the clips. I have a right to hear the clips. Who wants to walk blindly into something? Let me hear the clips, then maybe I would buy the thing and be able to enjoy it and give it a good rating.Until then, this musical Communism warrants Revolver a bad rating. Bad, bad, bad!"
4,This albums took music from the 60s to 70s and beyond.,"The usual high quality of The Beatles, plus the start of the search for something beyond the music they know they have already mastered.The new Beatles sound is defined in Tomorrow never knows and Eleanor Rigby: just expect the unexpected. And it applies as well to the young rock'n roll listeners in the 60s as to listeners of the early albums of The Beatles.Try the songs and enjoy it."
3,many fine songs to sing along with,Evolution of their progress with diverse sounds and tunes that capture many genres...nice to sing with many and to ponder direction (good and strange) of many
5,AMAZING,This is yet another great album from the fab four.I cant think why people would dislake such a beautiful album contaning gems like Yellow submarine.Highly recommended.
1,Weapon of Choice,This album is appropriately named - it's named in honor of the weapon you are most likely to use in your suicide after listening to this god-awful piece of crap!
2,I like nuts,The third track 'Whisteling hootenanny' is one of my owl time favorites. Worst about this CD: the guitarsolos in 'Help me'.Not convincing except for 'Whisteling hootenanny'
2,Really Doesn't Deserve It's Impeccable Reputation,"This album is often held out as being such a step forward for the Beatles and rock music, but the energy experienced in A Hard Day's Night and Help are mostly absent in Rubber Soul. Songs like And Your Bird Can Sing reach back to Beatlemania but songs like Here There and Everywhere and Eleanor Rigby are what resulted in boy bands like the Backstreet Boys (The Shape of My Heart). Thank goodness the Rolling Stones stayed with rock and roll and Led Zeppelin came along to drive music in a good direction. Once that happened, even the Beatles got back on track with The White Album and Abbey Road."
1,Truth in Advertising,You cannot download this to an MP3 player - very disapointing. Did not see this on the site where you select which version you want.
3,"Fun to read, but sloppy","This is definitely worth reading, covering an ill-understood time in French history. I really enjoyed Beevor's the Fall of Berlin and Stalingrad, and was expecting much from this book. For the most part, it delivers. However, it could have used a more sharp-eyed editor. Some examples: Personages (like Juliette Greco) are introduced without any background, (the background appears later in the book), the index is flimsy, (many people referred to in the book are simply missing from the Index), and Simone de Beauvoir is intermittently (and for no evident reason) referred to as ""Castor""(I understand it was her nickname). Ultimately, it is a good means of understanding France's difficulty in coming to terms with German occupation and the Vichy government."
1,"This was the itchiest, worst piece of jewelry I have ever worn!",I scratched my neck RAW wearing this. It turned black INSTANTLY and could NOT be polished. The worst piece of jewelry I have ever owned! I couldn't wear it more than one day without my neck being on fire with hives.
1,cracked soles,"Do not buy these shoes!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The soles crack after a month or so of moderate use. Wolverine will send you replacement shoes, but those soles crack also. When the soles crack, water can enter into the shoe. Check out other sites, you will find many other threads detailing the same problem. They finally sent me cost for the shoes plus return shipping. They stood behind the product, but why buy defective shoes?"
2,Not The Same Item Viewed,"I am a little disappointed that the item viewed on this site is NOT the item you recieve. I purchased this item because I like the design, and also the name. I have a linksys cable modem, and a linksys wireless access point of the same design. I purchused this item so that all three devices would be stackable. Well, the item recieved today is the ""new"" design which does me no good. I am sure the device works fine, but I really needed the old design."
1,Do not buy widescreen edition,"I got this, but you should NOT. Audio is about 5-6 seconds delayed, video is very grainy. I watched a regular copy and the video was no where near as bad as this and audio was fine. The packaging and top menu smacks of bootleg, but I don't know that for a fact. All I know is if you want a copy that is viewable DO NOT GET THIS ONE!"
3,Smile. Everything's OK.,"John Pizzarelli's new album is an unexpected lollipop. Pizzarelli sings and plays a collection of new material and standards on this album. Personnel include piano and bass along with his guitar. Most memorable are his cut-time major-key ditties, which are really quite happy. His ballads are less memorable, although everything on the album is high quality: Pizarelli's guitar playing is surprisingly agile, the sidemen are competent, and John's tenor voicing is personal and low key. He reminds me a bit of Michael Franks, but without the attitude. If you like nice, bright renditions of ""I Got Rhythm"" and ""Polka Dots and Moonbeams"", this album will make you smile."
4,Satisfactory,"I have all of Earl Hines ""The Indispensable"" CD and this one Vol. 5/6 is not the best (as music choice), but great sound."
4,It is MORE than a cook book!,"I now hava more than 150 books that deal with food. Of these, six are of the series of books co-written by that great culinary team, Craig Claiborne/Pierre Franey. These tomes are MORE than just a collection of recipes and instructions. They are full of information about their lives in the kitchen. The books transport the reader from their easychair right to the N.Y. Times kitchens, where you are given the opportunity to peek over the shoulder of these men in action! You become part of the cooking process and learn and learn and learn!"
5,Luscious Indeed!,"This small book packs in a large number of recipes. Your cravings will be satisfied. Recipes range from the homey and simple Grilled Chocolate-Stuffed Bananas to the elegant and simple Ultimate Chocolate Marquise. There are also some requiring a little technique, which is well described and easy to follow. There are even 9 recipes for chocolate sauce. And there are loads of pictures to help you picture the final product. My new favorite chocolate cookbook."
1,Ridiculous.,"88 Minutes starring Al Pacino is complete garbage. They must have paid Pacino a lot of cash because I can't see this guy thinking, wow this is an awesome script. Leelee Sobieski is wasted in this film and even Alicia Witt looks like she's bored out of her skull. The premise is so bad and what's with all the nudity? You won't believe how lame the ending is, keep clear from this train wreck!"
1,Best minute was the 89th,"Yek! Pacino slipped this one in without anyone picking up on it. Good for him because this flick is a cliched bag o'you-know-what,like watching a melodrama from the '50s complete with strings for tense scenes and camera switching among actors as the whodunnit? questions unfolds. Was it the embittered student? the sensitive lesbian? the jailed, evil crook?Dun, dun, duuuuuun."
1,C R A P P O L A !,"It's no wonder that this stale predictable ""thriller"" was shelved for a few years. Pacino(with the worst hairdo I've seen in years)has become a self parody and doesn't get any help from a sleepwalking cast in this extremely tedious film. I felt as if Al Pacino was shouting at everyone to wake them up! I guess it's not the worst film I've ever seen, but there are just too many better films of this nature to waste any time on this one.......oh yeah and you can see the ending coming a mile away!"
4,Exhausted,"I call my review Exhausted simply because I am enjoying but usually having difficulty to find the time to view a 19 hours T V Western series - Branded! So far I have not viewed every episode but to date the stories and the actors be they guest stars or familiar faces among the character actors make the stories believeable and tense even if we know Chuck Connors will win the day to appear in the next episode.Of course I am a Western fan and never tire of watching Westerns from the good old days of T V cowboys.Branded is different in that the hero is seen as a coward when in reality he is on a mission only known to high command in the U S army.Connors has the face, expressions and stature to carry it off successfully.Fascinating that he proved to be a fine actor in manly roles rather than a sports star.Much enjoyed and episodes are not too long so must find a half hour to watch another tale from the West. Go on order it!"
5,Great,"I don't know why most reviews for this movie is so bad. I love this movie! I think if you like musicals (especially pop musicals), you will like this. I actually like this better than the original Grease because its not so overhyped. I like Grease, but im tired of it and hardly ever watch it anymore. No the acting isnt the greatest, and the singing isnt either. But I like the overall movie and the musical numbers are fun, and the jokes are funny. Give it a chance!"
1,UGH!,I hated this movie. I have never seen anything as bad! The acting sucked and so did the music. This movie was just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with!
1,Horrible... worst film ever made,"It is the worst movie. The acting is cheesy, the songs suck, and it does not even make sense. The T-Birds and the Pink Ladies, were really cool in the first movie, but in this one they were the biggest geeks and not even good looking. The T-Birds in the original movie, would have beat these guys up if they attended Rydelle in the same year. It should not have even been made..."
5,I LIKED IT BETTER THAN THE 1ST!!!!!!!!!!,I really truly did! the Michael guy is beyond hott! Plus it has such great songs! Michelle Pfifer sings so good especially at the very end Love wil turn back the hands of time is the best! Well Watch this movie because Its a classic!!!!!! Is it out on dvd?
2,One step too far...,"I loved Grease. But I didn't like Grease 2. The most memorable part was that song about reproduction. Michelle Pfeiffer is a weak lead, but she had to follow Newton-John, so she was OK. Maxwell Caulfield didn't really work for me and his accent really got irritating. Was it meant to be British? The T-Birds have really gone off the rails. They tried to kill Michael (Caulfield). And the Pink Ladies have gone from bad to worse without Rizzo.OK as a sequel but a million miles from Grease."
3,From What I Saw Of It...,"..""Grease 2"" was not that bad. I didn't see the whole thing, but I saw about half of it on tv. It doesn't hold a candle to the first film, but it has some good things goign for it. The plot is paper thin. The performances are pretty stiff (Michelle Pfeiffer, my favorite actress after Ann-Margret, has done much better), but the songs were catchy and the film was overall watchable. I'd recommend it."
4,1 vs 2,"Prefer it to Grease 1. Witht the exception of Maxwell Caulfield, I prefer the cast of Grease 2 to that of Grease 1. Michelle Pfeiffer brings exceptionalism to fluff, and Adrian Zmed captures the fifties better than Travolta."
5,Pink Lady Perfect!,I think this movie was perfect. it does kinda take away the point of grease but the music is much better and so are most of the actors. i always get the catchy words of the songs stuck in my head for days--it's great!!!
4,Who's that Guy????,"I know, I know - but I just can't help it, I love this movie! Especially Maxwell Caulfield! He did such a great job playing the role of Michael (Mr. Shakespeare writing-Cool Rider-Carrington). Even though, this was a poor sequel - I still like it because of the set and the continuing themes that are evident. My favorite scenes/songs are the ""Cool Rider"" and ""Who's that Guy?"" scenes/songs. You should try watching it - you may be pleasantly surprised. Given, ""Grease"" is the best and ""Grease 2"" is not of the same caliber but it's still worth watching."
2,Don't Bother,"I purchased three of these for the front of my house. They look good and the construction is decent. The main problem is with the photocell circuit. As the sun goes down and it gets dark, these fixtures turn off and on rapidly, until it gets dark enough to stay off. They have no built-in time delay or a latching circuit to prevent this from happening. This rapd flipping on and off results in drastically lower life of the bub. One of the three has already quit working completely. The flourescent light bulbs are the kind that plug-in, not screw in. These plug-in type of light bulbs are not readily available to the consumer market. You have to go to the internet or an electric supply house to purchase them."
3,b-movie,"OK B-movie not on par with Cagneys WB movies,just average B-movie but Mae Clarke never looked better then she does in this movie"
5,Spectacular Shiny Piece,"Beautifull piece, shiny as diamond, I will definitly buy more merchandise from this seller."
1,Sucked!,"This movie sucked! Everything about it was terrible. Some may also find it offensive for straying far from the biblical narrative. Although this movie is called ""King David"", the story bares little resemblance to the story of King David found in the books of Samuel and Chronicles."
4,King David,"This video was rather good with acting and story line. I try to buy as many Biblical videos to get all the ideas and perspectives from each director, writer, etc. on what they wanted to promote when creating the drama of a certain Biblical persona. I believe some movies are better than others, and this video rates around the middle of all the ""Davids"" that I've seen. You'll enjoy the movie as a whole. It obviously is the newest one produced to date. Well worth the investment!"
3,"Follows the Tanach, But Topically","This movie is nice, but not much more than that. As a religious Jews, I can say that while the story line is pretty on, you won't get a sense of the majesty, nobility, and intense spirituality that were hallmarks of the real King David, author of the Psalms.Plus, if you care about the images flashing before your eyes, you will be accosted by two scenes of totally gratuitous nudity which I would say are not appropriate for children, and not likely pleasing to religious adults.Richard Gere is an okay David. Again, I don't think he had a sense of how great his character was. The scene with Goliath is worth viewing."
5,Excellent and accurate biblical portrayal!,"This biblical story recount of the lives of King Saul and King David were very true to what I have read in the Old Testament stories in the books of ""Samuel"" and Kings"". Having Richard Gere portray the adult King David didn't hurt either!!! This is one of the better ""bible"" story movies I have seen to date. Thoroughly enjoyed seeing this biblical story ""come to life"" and Richard Gere is terrific in it! Lot's of action and well done!"
4,Very good movie!,"This was a very good movie about King David, I was impressed and surprise because usualy I don't like biblical movies with big names actors but Richard Gere give a great acting performance as David, he his very believable and the movie atmophere is good, it put you in that time. I recommand this movie to anyone who like biblical movies. I am not a person who usualy impressed by movies or books, let say I am very hard to please about that but this movie deserve the 4 stars I gave him."
4,"King David, Bible","I don't care what they say about this movie. I loved it. The movie's bases on the book of Samuel, that's in the Bible. It's pretty accurate too. I'm a Richard Gere fan, also."
4,Very Functional,"This book has great insight into what it takes to be a creative author. My only complaint is the content of some of the sample stories. I realize they are very well written and serve the intended purpose. However, when limited pieces of suspense and crime stories are included it leaves the readers (who are simply trying to to get an education) with a terrible feeling in the pit of their stomach."
5,Very informative....a must buy and read book........,"This book depicts Mary as an intelligent woman of that time. Jesus liberated Mary. When you read this book, you'll understand what I mean. The other gospels werent too nice to her because she was a woman and Jesus favored her the most. She was more insiteful than the men. It's no wonder they portrayed her as a prostitute in order to destroy her character, they were so threatened by her wisdom and intelligence. This book will open your eyes to the truth. Even to this day women are still struggling in this man's world. Buy this book....a MUST READ."
4,Not the best Misery Loves Co album,"I agree with the previous reviewer. This album lacks the anger and the lucid lyrics of the previous two. As I listened to this album, it sounded like MLC had softened in their two compared to Not Like Them. Also, the songs did seem to blend together and were not as varied as Not Like Them. Overall, I still like this album, but if you are new to MLC, then I suggest trying their previous two releases."
2,Other reviews are right.... this thing is LOUD,"I really couldn't believe it when others noted how loud this thing was. I ordered it anyway. Unfortunately, they were right. This thing is egregiously loud. It's in my upstairs bonus room and I can hear it from my master bedroom downstairs. It's louder than all the rest of my computer equipment combined. Too bad too, because it's an attractive piece that seems to work fine and fits nicely on my desk with my Linksys router and Linksys Vonage box.Anyone need a good switch to put in a closet?"
4,Visual Masterpiece Epic,"I will not delve into the story-telling aspects of this movie - that is a subjective interpretation you will have to journey on your own.But the lasting effect for me is the visual and cinematographic aspects.Quite literally, it is like being an audience to a beautiful video game being played on your TV.The art direction is epic, and you will come out impressed, especially since it did not have the American-level Hollywood budget.The story might not have satisfied me, but I certainly applaud the visual aspects of this movie.Leave your critique glasses aside and just enjoy this wonderful epic.*I watched it English-dubbed via Netflix, but as always, to fully enjoy the emotions of the characters, leave it in its original Japanese audio and put on the subtitles.*"
5,A Keeper,"The graphics are outstanding in this movie. We loved the story line and how it developed. The English dubbing is just great, they did a great job so you can enjoy the visual experience of this movie. It has some light comedy to make you laugh and tragedy to make you pause and action to keep you watching it nonstop.Definitely glad to have this one in our collection. There's nothing else I can add that others haven't already, but we enjoyed it so much I just had to take the time to give it the 5 stars it so richly deserves."
3,"OK, but not great.","These are ""soft and chewy"" (translate: ""gooey""). I prefer the larger, slightly crisper variety. They taste OK, but not great. Perhaps the ones I received had been on the shelf a while, but they seemed to have a slightly medicinal taste."
5,Absolutely delicious!,"This is a great flavor from Genisoy, whose products I love anyway. Great way to get in some protein and also good for times when you just can't make a meal. Good to have around for emergencies."
4,Follows post-world war two american art after Jackson Polloc,"Jackson Pollock is seen as the greatest American artist ever, because of his poured paintings of the late 40's and early 50's. Dying in a drunken car crash in 1956, he left behind a legacy of American artists who weren't driven by European art tastes. The Abstract Expressionist movement, large canvases, and Pop Art are all traced back to Pollock.Also includes chapters about Rauschenberg, Johns, de Koonig, and Warhol, among others"
1,Please...,"Give me a break. This mish-mash of secondhand information is little more than easily readable. With little regard to chronology, Ratcliff separates the various artistic trends of postwar America using representative artists. All of the stories in this book have been told before, and better, by the artists and critics themselves. This kind of 'art journalism' (not unlike Calvin Tomkins' work) is informative, to be sure, but in quite a superficial and unsatisfying way. I suggest reading Irving Sandler's 'American art of the 1960s' for something as informative and enjoyable but with some opinions and insight."
4,good book,This book is helpful if you practice and looking to make your own routine. Very helpful but teached more of a fitness type of yoga.
5,Save me from Depression,I really enjoyed this book. I loved the breathing exercises particularly. And i also enjoyed the principles which really helped me put my life in perspective.
5,its too good,"I did not find any book on programming which could be used on any language without much difficulty. Its presents the logic exactly the way I like - ""Discover your way to the solution!"""
1,Awful,"I ordered 4 of these as they look nice from the photo they currently have. But when I received them, they look awful. Poor quality - one was made with pink string for some reason. Little pieces were falling off everywhere. These are not something you could have indoors as they would make a mess and look ugly. Don't make the mistake I did if you want these for indoors or even outdoors."
3,Sci Fi techno thriller,"I generally like Coonts, and I have grown to know Jake Grafton. This book was a departure. I think there were too many gizmo, wizbang, gee-whiz kind of toys in this novel. The characters never really had to stretch themselves to accomplish anything, because the technology did it all for them.The other thing I kept having trouble with was the character of Charlie. If he was a Marine Sniper in Vietnam and the book is set in about 2020, then Charlie would be pushing 70+ years. It just didn't hold together.However, if you walk away from the need for a realistic, techno thriller and look at the book as Sci Fi, well it isn't too bad. The gadgets are kind of kool when you look at it this way, although, the characters need some work."
1,Not so much a helpful guide as it is just an angry rant,"Coping with POF, I was hoping for some words of wisdom from someone who has been through it first-hand. That is what I had expected this book to provide. Instead I felt I was reading an angry woman's diary. I barely got through 1/4 of the book when I decided this wouldn't be much help. Reading about how many and what kind of tampons and pads this woman used to how she hated the world wasn't what I call helpful. I ended up returning the book as even for only $3, it was a waste."
5,Great little book about a great little dog,"This is a very helpful book, well organized so it is very easy to find what you are looking for.Like the book says, Jack Russells aren't for everyone. They are brilliant. That means they can think of much more trouble to get into. They will never bore you. But if you don't like excitement, get a cocker spaniel."
5,Great book!,GREAT book! It's definitely a book that I will share with others and will probably reread myself! Francine Rivers is a very good author.
5,EXCELLENT! A fantastic piece of work.,"I just finished reading The Atonement Child. At first I wasn't going to read it as it was not an issue for me. I am prolife and have never had an abortion. I read the comments here though and decided to go ahead a read it. I found myself involved in the story right away and not only that but when I was finished I found my faith had been strengthed. Only Francine Rivers could produce a piece of work such as this. I would highly recommend this book to everyone. It is a fantastic piece work. Once again, my hats off to Francine."
2,Mixed Emotions,"I was torn up about admiring the courage of the heroine while at the same time detesting her fiance and his misogynistic behavior. What a joke that he was the ""spiritual leader"" of their relationship, I guess because he was a man? And I was simmering again every time I read about how worried Dynah was about losing her virginity and being ""unpure"" for her husband. I used to love Francine Rivers but much of this book makes me want to gag."
5,Inspiring,"The subject of this book is a difficult one and Mrs. Rivers's talent of breathing real life and a realistic Christian struggles into this story is beautiful. As I was reading this book I could not help but put myself in the place of Dynah, the main character. What would I have done in her shoes? I'm sure I would have had the same doubts and question God; however, would I have made the right decision. What is the right decision is a central part of this book but not the main point. The point of this story is to trust in God even when the most unthinkable thing has happen. This is hard for every person of faith and I found this story inspiring."
2,Unrealistic!,"I have discovered Francine Rivers by reading Mark of the Lion series which was a masterpiece for me. By picking up ""The Atonement Child"", I was expecting the book to be great. But the book was far away from the real life. The heroine who was raped and became pregnant from that rape was somehow distant from the whole situation like that did not involve her but someone else. I did not feel the heroine suffering at all. I did not feel any emotions in that book. I was expecting more to the story. The writer before writing about the subject should have consulted people who found themselves in similar situations if she was not able to picture herself in similar situation just for the book. The book was predictable."
1,Judgemental and One Dimensional,"I am a big fan of several other Francine Rivers books, but this one was a total disappointment.Ms. River's own bias comes through very quickly in the book, preventing her from treating the subject of abortion as a complex personal decision and the subject of rape is glossed over as if it really is not an important factor in the plot. Because of the author's bias she never really deals with both sides of the issue in a realistic way. Within the first few chapters it becomes predictable and clearly judgemental. This book could actually be hurtful to a woman who had experienced such a situation.The characters are one-dimensional and quickly portrayed as perfect or evil depending on their stance on abortion.This is a soap-box book and nothing more. It is certainly lacking the quality of her other books."
1,Just awful,"I finished this book only because it was a selection of my book club. Frankly I did not care what happened to any of these people (as if I couldn't figure it out for myself by a quarter of the way through it). The dialogue was stilted and preachy, the characters were threadbare. I thought the book was very poorly written--something I would read from a high school student. One dimensional characters. Just awful."
3,To Each His Own.,"The series of the Lineage of Grace include UNAFRAID, UNASHAMED, UNSPOKEN, UNSHAKEN, and UNVEILED. Her earlier novels were about contemporary subjects as this one. She had started two series now about Sons of Encoragement (two of five completed) and Wome of the Bible Worthy (three finishes of a series of five). Since 1986, most of her stories are based on biblical characters with some of her own creating. They are called historical fiction."
5,Very good author.,It was an interesting book on the struggles a person might go thru trying to decide what to do in the situation like she found herself in. A very good book and yes I would recommend reading this book.
4,"Better than 99% of the genre, but not perfect","This book is so much better written than 99% of the genre that it seems a pity to criticize it. However... there is a problem. The author uses characters' consumer choices as little labels. One person eats a Linda McCartney meal, another listens to Lionel Ritchie. You can't help but feel that he is laughing at them. Not so Resnick who has impeccable taste. Near the end a bad character hops into bed with a Jeffrey Archer novel. It is then you realize that he is damned."
5,aussie rock at it's best!!!,"I have loved the saints ever since their first album came out on sire, along with dead boys, richard hell etc....! This is a compilation from their first 2 albums and I love every song! First album is more punk and second album is a little more accessable! You will love this compilation if you buy it!"
2,Theory and Practice of Tabla,Too many unnecessary details for a beginer. Not well organized. There are better books out there.
5,Efficient Filter,"Greetings - I've had this filter running in a 4' x 6' 100 gallon turtle pond for 4 months now. I does a great job keeping the water clean (two small mud turtles & a RES). I purchased an extra set of filter pads to expedite the weekly changes and disrupt my turtles activities (sleeping, napping, resting, sunbathing & eating) as little as possible. So far so good..."
1,Worked well until it STOPPED!,"I purchased this thru Amazon about 3-4 months ago....and it suddenly quit.Worked great until then. Not sure who to contact......UPDATE:Contacting the company and found out that Amazon is not a ""designated distributor"" for their product so they won't take it back!!I tried to take apart the pump as per their suggestion and found out the pump impeller was Broken!....and the whole thing is now good as a door stop.I don't have the money to waste.And this was definitely a BIG WASTE."
1,"Tips over, clogs quickly, broke in less than 3 months.","Worked as expected originally, great for smaller pond. On the down side, it will quickly tip over in your pond without some additional weight on the filter box. The filter box quickly clogs but conditions could vary from pond to pond. Initially I was pleased but then the pump broke in less than 3 months of use. Too much money for inferior product."
2,Lasted 2 1/2 months,"So far this pump/filter setup has worked for me. My pond is 8x10 and 2 1/2 feet at its deepest and 1 foot at the lowest. The pump has been running none stop for 2 weeks now and I have not experienced any issues. The filter that came with it is good, it does the job of filtering and it is also easy to clean.Edit:I have now changed my review to 2 stars. After just a little over 2 months of off and on use the pump has stopped working. I thought it might have been clogged but when I took it out of my pond it was clean and no excessive debris was in the filter. If you are look for a pump to run continuously then stay away from this one."
1,Product description may need revisiting,"Pondmaster PMK190 is rated at 190 gph but it did not seem to pump as much as other pumps I have owned. The picture on the box shows a large spray and the one purchased may have been malfunctioning so it was returned to the manufacturer for testing.It is also unclear how well the filtration system would work based on the short stint. However, the path of water may not be optimum since the water is not drawn through the entire filter."
2,PMK190 Review,"I have been running this pump for about a month straight now and have done cleanings on the filters once a week. It trips my breaker everytime I plug/unplug it. The filter is removing algae from my pond (190 gallon), but my pond is far from being clear. I have also been using algicide... It may be time to spend the $$$ for a UV filter. The filter maybe good for a smaller pond, but so far its performance is unsatisfactory at best in mine."
3,Decent MP3 Player,"The MP3 Player is not a bad deal for about $53. It is everything I expected it to be, except it drains batteries like there is no tomorrow. A Triple A Duracell will only last approximately 3 1/2 hours."
1,Walk away...,This MP3 player is poorly designed and difficult to operate. We were so frustrated with it that we returned it to Amazon. We gave up trying to get it to work.
3,"A fascinating, but angry analysis.","I have read this book twice and keep returning to it for reference; however, something about it bothers me each time. I am fascinated by Harwood's ""methodology of history"" applied to Biblical texts normally evaluated with inductive theological methods. Unfortunately, the author approaches his subject with undisguised anger for the perceived frauds perpetrated on him by the religion itself. I am sympathetic to Harwood's goals of opening out the study of Biblical texts to honest historical analysis, but his venom may have marred his objectivity. MAY HAVE... I simply don't know. I will keep returning to this book and I am glad to own it, but I would grade it higher if it was not so emotionally-charged. Perhaps Harwood's promised ""Fully-Translated"" Bible will be less angry."
5,"Well Written, Fascinating, But Slow At Times - But Still A Must Read","This is an incredibly well written and more importantly, well researched book. It starts slowly with the beginning of religion, then shows how it encompasses simple themes and needs, like crop harvests and spring and winter. At times it can be stuffy and seem like the author is drifting, but he soon ties it back into religion, and ultimately leads back to Judaism and Christianity. What really sets this book apart from others is the research. Harwood constantly is tutoring the reader with research on almost every subject, for example, how a social customs of a certain period changed from an earlier custom or belief, and how it was then re-written into a biblical text, which can be shown with period writings and different versions of religous texts.A highly recommended book for anyone interested in religion."
1,Sarah Plain and Tall,I did not care for this book because the plot could have been developed better. More detail would have been appreciated.
3,Classic Story filled with love and compassion!,"Sarah, Plain and Tall is a Newberry Award winner for intermediate readers. This book can be classified as historical fiction.The story takes place on the frontier. You can gain the overall sense of the setting, however, it is never clearly defined. A young girl, Anna, tells the story of her family's life without their mother. Anna's father puts an ad in the newspaper for a wife and mother of his children. Sarah answers the ad, and the group begins to create a family out of love.This is an enjoyable story, and it will make you smile! I read and reviewed this book while in Dr. Tom Sherman's Children's Literature course at Winona State University."
4,"Wow, Is This A Nice Movie!","What a nice movie! In this day-and-age, a movie this low-key and simply nice is refreshing to see. It's almost shocking, especially with Christopher Walken, playing against type. He and Glenn Glose end up being an inspiring romantic couple.What I think I enjoyed best was the wonderful cinematography. With all the beautiful rural scenery, it was pretty to see. It was also nice to see Walken play a role this sedate and a pleasure to see a modern film that featured well-mannered kids, not spoiled brats. In fact, there are no nasty people nor bad language is this film, either. Yet, it is not sickeningly sweet, either.It's not anything super dramatic that will knock your socks off, but a pleasant, very nice low-key 98 minutes to kick back and relax watching."
5,"Sarah, Plain and Tall","The worst thing about Anna's older brother Caleb is that Mama died the day after Caleb was born. So when Papa puts an add in the newspaper for a wife, Anna and Caleb get excited. Sarah writes back from Maine. She says she will come to the farm and see what the family is like.""I am plain and tall and will wear a yellow bonnet"" she writes. When Sarah comes,she starts to miss the ocean. Will Sarah stay with Papa, Anna, and Caleb? Or will she go back to the ocean forever?"
4,"It is about a family in the prairy that needs a mother,wife","IT IS A WONDERFUL BOOK I THOUGHT !There are alot of qestions to be asked and also to be anserd.It was so touching to me.You almost feel thay you are going back in time. A lso it feels that you are there and going threw the same thing that they are going threw. When Sarah was going to town the first time I read it I thought Sarah was going to buy a train ticket to go back to Maine, but she did not go back to main afterall.I did not like the re veiw that said it was a boring book."
3,Get a short history lesson while reading a family story.,"Kids should Sarah Plain and Tall because if they like the midwest and a farm, it would be interesting to them. If they like animals, it would be good, too, because there are a lot of animals in this book. Another reason kids should read this book is the characters. They're great! There aren't too many to follow -just Sarah, Anna, Caleb, and Papa. You get to really know their feelings. It's not too boring because you always wonder if Sarah will stay or move back to Maine. The book made me want to ask a lot questions."
3,"Sarah, Plain and Tall Reviewed By Capozza's Crew","If you like historical fiction, you should read Sarah, Plain and Tall for three reasons. This novel, to begin, explores the geography of Kansas and Maine. Sarah, who is from Maine, travels to Kansas, to be a wife and mom. There, she learns about life on the plains, and brings the sea to the Wittings. Furthermore, there is suspense in this novel. I kept wondering if Sarah would stay or return to Maine. The characters also have to face a squall, which is a wind, rain, and hail storm. Another good thing about this book is the characters, because they are funny yet responsible. Caleb, the youngest, is a typical brother, and Anna is a classic older sister. In conclusion, Sarah, Plain and Tall is an excellent book for all ages."
5,Sarah and the plain review,"She will be at the train station tonight and her name is Sarah and she's plain and tall.This is a saying in the book that really got us reading. This was a really good book and when this book started it was very interesting. This was about three family members, papa, Anna, and Caleb. Their mom died when Caleb was born. Papa , Anna, and Caleb once got a letter from a lady named Sarah who wants to move in with them since she lives by herself. She meets them at the train station at night. Sarah came home with them and was homesick. One day papa taught sarah how to drive the wagon ,and one day sarah drove into town and bought Anna some colored pencils for Anna to draw the sea . This was a great book."
4,excellent value,"It was impossible to find an actual retail outlet that had this particular phone charger in stock, a little web surfing and voila! Product arrived promptly and as promised. And you can't beat the price."
3,Be sure to match your required Diameter,"Here is ""the bottom line"". The Thetford Oar Stop description does not display its internal diameter anywhere in any text. I searched high and low, here and across the web, then believed that it must be correct to fit any standard oar, or at least have some stretchability. Not so!This Oar Stop is 1.5"" inside the interior diameter and will not stretch. My oars happen to be 1.75"" (i don't know why, I just bought 'em like any other oars I have ever bought).So, I got to buy Oar Stops that will not fit my oars and, of course, the cost to return them does not make economic sense and, therefore, I get to provide this Review so others will learn from my mistake.Nothing wrong with the Oar Stops --- IF THEY FIT!"
3,The Guys are Great but...,"Like eveyone who is coming to the site, I'm a huge BSB fan. They are all great and usually their videos are incredible. However, this video is just O.K. It's great to see homevideos of them but we don't really want to see them back in the day as much as we want to see them in action now."
3,i LOVE bsb.. but the video aint all that,i know what yall are thinkin... yeah... 9 bucks and i get a bsb video.. well.. lemme say that it's 30 minutes long... and it reminds me much of the nkotb videos i have... i mean.. if ur a HUGE fan.. sure.. get it... check it out.. thats what i did.. the footage is like a home video from way back in the day... and it made me dizzy watching it... and it has this lady talkin over it with the corniest voice i ever heard...but.. if u must.. then get it...it does have a lot of shots of the guys talkin
1,Bad Quality,The clips on this video are good the only problem is that on the copy that I received there was no sound. Plus the picture quality was BAD! I would not recommend this video. As far as I can tell all of the footage is also available on the VHS Backstreet Boys: The Video. I would recommend buying that one instead.
1,Do NOT buy,"Do not buy nitro bottles that look like this one. The caps are very cheaply made. The nitro fuel it self will almost always cause the cap to crack at the point that the metal hose meets the cap at the top.Just find another bottle, don't get waste your money on this one."
1,"Extremely fast playing, can't stand it!","I just about had a nervous breakdown listening to the Allegro Solemne. Where is the beauty in a piece that is played in such an extremely fast tempo? Her method really ruined it for me. I was considering buying this disc, but borrowed it from my local library first, and I'm so glad I did, I saved my money! Ok, so you're a virtuoso, Sharon Isbin, I get it, but the extreme speed of your playing just ruins it. So much more can be gotten out of the piece if it is played at a more moderate tempo. End of story."
2,Either I'm dumb or...Nice graphics btw,"I kept running out of bullets like the other person said...couldn't get pass the place after you get of the cave with spiders in it, lmao xDI suck at this game or it's really hard...something like that, lolThe graphics are amazing though, but it's gathering dust in a drawer since I can't get past that part =\Dumb bullets...unlimited would be nice, rofl"
1,sucks on ice,i rented the game and played and it friggin stinks.i would rather count sand than play that stupid game.you run out of bullets every time you get a gun.it is boring and the graphics stink.if you spend themoney on this game YOU WILL BE MAD!!!!
4,Clones of Russia,"A strange story of swearing, sober, money-thirsty new Russia where actions missed for viewers following a poor translation into classic English.Provides interesting info on a real level of Soviet science and engineering industrializing the cloning of humans decades ago."
2,And there goes another bit of cash.,"I've used this sealer perhaps 2 dozen times over the past year and suddenly it just stopped sealing. Almost out of the box there was a problem with the heat strip, a little spot on it that got hotter than in other places and occasionally melted through the plastic. then the foam pieces stuck to each other and pulled out of place. Next the Hands free light stopped lighting up. Next the heat strip got an odd wrinkle in it. And finally it won't vacuum or seal. It's a handy item when it works, but now it's just another bit of non-recyclable junk with costly accessories."
4,seems good for day 1,went to target and bought the base model for [...] vs foodsaver [...]. I bought it to vacuum seal venison. it took a couple minutes to figure out. I think the key is to not over stuff the bags and allow a couple inches of bag to hang out of the sealer. this seems to give the airflow the space to work well. i'd buy ot again tomorrow if i had to for 30 bucks less
3,Needs to be bigger,"This tools works, but after extended use you'll wish the burnishing rod was thicker (less flex) and a bit longer ( so that you can burnish a card scraper in a single stroke easier)."
5,Works great,"Works great. Only used it 3 times so far, but it's better than my drill bits to burnish with. My bits scratch and so far, this hasn't."
5,Broadband for Dummies,"I found this book extremely beneficial in determining the effect this new technology will have on my growing business and what I need to do to hop onto the Broadband-wagon. The language and diagrams are easy to read and understand, proving invaluable to me and will help anyone who is technically challenged."
1,Really superficial,"Anyone who uses the internet at all on a dial-up ISP knows intuitively that the lack of broadband is what keeps the web from reaching full potential. AOL who has built its business on catering to teenieboppers at $20 bucks a pop, and has apparently found it to be in its strategic interest to continue the slooooo unreliable access, contributed to the long delay in broadband access to residential customers. We all know that it's happening, and even AOL with it's lash-up with TW can not stop it.This book adds little to one's knowledge of broadband. I feel certain that given their background, the authors must know a lot about their subject, but it's difficult to perceive a more superficial treatment of the subject. If the best you can do is explain broadband in terms of plumbing, skip it altogether. My advice concerning this book: skip it altogether."
2,Disappointing,"The title story is amusing enough, but after that, the ""adventures"" of Professor von Igelfeld are pretty tedious."
2,For beginners only,"If you know very few of Photoshop,this is a good book for you.If you are an advanced user,trying to aquire new skills on BW processing,forget it. Most hints you will already know and there are even questionable techniques,(as converting from color to BW by RGB->Grayscale command,and not channel mixer manipulation or other techniques that can minimize noise channels).Did not fullfilled my expectations."
1,Not for Robin Mark listeners,"If you like Robin Marks' type of Celtic worship - you will be sadly disappointed with this cd. It baffles me as to why an artist departs from what makes them likeable or successful. The old saying,""If isn't broke don't fix it"" applies to this cd. This is overmixed, studio refined, gimmicky and uninspiring. May I say it is like as if Loreena McKennit thought it may be a good idea to change and become like Karen Carpenter, or Mylee Cyrus. There is a woman on this cd trying to mystically chant like Enya - it doesn't work. Reminds me of Yoko Ono's orgasm impresssion from Lennon-Ono Double Fantasy. Very trying for a worship cd. Increase your donation to the offering plate instead of wasting your money on this release from Robin Mark. Shame on you Robin for attempting to change from how GOD made you successful. Holdfast to your gift - WORSHIP!"
1,Nothing But PureTrash!,"Trina has an interesting voice, but these are terribly uninteresting trashy tunes filled with wild cursing and crudity with no real thought or creativity. These is a really sickening segment where Trina's on the phone with some ignorant ghetto girl profanely rambling as if she had never seen the inside of a school house. How anyone can find trash like this entertaining is just beyond me! I guess it's time for the Geritol and rocking chair for me! (But hey, at least it's better than Khia's ""Thug Misses"")."
4,Trina,"I think that Trina is the same as all women ,but the only difference is that she is not ashamed of what she does. I really admire her for a job well done on her first album."
2,you've got to be kidding me,this isn't rap. this is anything but rap. i bought this cd like a month or 2 ago and i still think that theres only 2 or 3 good songs on it. i would advise no one to pick this album up because it shows no talent and its worse than pain is love by ja rule
1,I agree.,There's really nothing more to add to what was originally stated about this movie other than I concur with their review. It's all true. Caveat emptor!
3,Definitely Weird - Off the Wall And Not What You'd Expect From a UCLA researcher,"The basis of a good researcher is neutrality and reserve, keeping a distance between themselves and the subjects whose lives they are studying. The book is disturbing and brings into question the motives and ethics of the author-researcher as he tried to recreate the details of a paranoid state that his subjects were experiencing.Dr. Siegel is an accomplished and respected expert in abnormal psychiatry and biobehavioral science. However, this book is more than a little bit creepy and disturbing."
1,Terrible obscuro Sonic wannabe,"Archie sucks. They make TERRIBLE Sonic comics! Not only this one but many many other that suck. I mean, Sonic and a stupid squirrel thing are dating? Whats worng with Amy Rose? And Knuckles looks UGLY!!! And he dates an even uglier b***h later on in the comic. And Super Sonic was just pointless. He was better in the games. I got Sonic Mega Collection PLUS and this was something that made me dislike the game more. It sucks so bad that it can't even suck because it sucks so suckily much. AVOID and DO NOT listen to good reviews! THEY ARE LIARS!!! 0/10! Complete turd!"
4,Post-Punk's great band,Liverpool's answer to Manchester's Joy Division. A great album from 1981. McCulloch and Co. deliver a grand performance.
2,Why Did I Buy This?,"Bought this stylus when stylus was new for the smartphone and other devices. I thought it would be responsive and accurate when writing words down or drawing but I was wrong. Buy a cheaper one like this, its the same. it works with other touch pad devices not just one product like the razr maxx. I gave my stylus to my parents because I have no use for it. I use my fingers, more accurate than the stylus."
4,GMI Keepsafe Gate,We purchased this gate for the top of our steps for the dogs. A regular child gate was there previously and it looked like a giant fort. I give it four stars instead of five because there was a little difficulty with the installation. I am fortunate because my husband is very handy. The really nice thing about the gate is that it folds up against the wall and is not in your way when you walk past it. There is a metal support bar in the middle on the bottom so the gate stays sturdy. Not really for kids but great for pets. Especially smaller ones.
5,Perfect gate for my doggie,"I have a wide opening on my wrap around porch and a dog that we don't want wandering the neighborhood. This gate was easy to put on, it fit almost perfectly on my old hardware. I did change the hardware for the new the new hardware supplied because the gate is outside on a covered porch and the old metal screws,etc were rusted. Easy one two three installation, fast delivery, it was in perfect condition with all of its parts.I didn't think I'd be able to get this kind of ""accordion"" gate because I thought they were not ""child friendly"" but since mine is for a dog I don't need child friendly so I was thrilled to find it. My girlfriend is buying one for her house too."
2,Did the job for a few weeks then broke.,I would recommend getting a yard cable for your dog and attaching it to your porch of a more durable gate. This did not do the job.
5,"I have one, it is the best ever","I bought this gate because the one I had broke in less than 30 daysThis gate is made of high quality materials and heavy wood, and assembled wellIf you need a gate,this one is greatI plan to buy another one soon"
5,GMI keepsafe 108-inch expansion,"We have a large doorway from the living room into the rest of the house and needed a fence to use for grandbabies and pets as well. We use this fence every day and it works great. It securely latches so the little ones can't open it and the dogs can't push it open either. It says to install it a few inches off the floor but because our dogs are little, we put it almost right on top of the floor so there's no space between it and the floor and it works great. Highly recommend for use with children or pets."
1,No thanks!,"I guess I'm old-fashioned, but I like it when the heroine only has sex with the hero. That is most certainly not the case in this horrid book. I couldn't even finish it. I should have read *all* of the reviews here first."
5,Bertrice Small - say no more !,"To all of the dedicated Bertrice Small readers. This was the first book of hers that I had read. I found that I could not get enough and subsequently purchased everything she has ever written.If you want romance, adventure, wonderful love scenes, and reading that you just can't put down - read her. You won't be sorry."
4,A guilty pleasure!,"In general I HATE the historical romance genre. But I really do like Beatrice Small. Her plots and characters are complicated enough to be fairly believable and keep me interested, while still making the book light reading. Some of the dialogue is a little bit cheesy in some places, but overall this is the book to read if you tend to stay away from historical romance."
1,What Is With The Sellers of This Book?,"At the time I write this review, this book is not available through Amazon directly, and there are only 2 Amazon partner sellers listed for the book, one selling it for $63 and one for $278. However, if you look at ""what others bought,"" the book appears to have been reprinted under the name ""The Magnesium Miracle"" (same author), and sells through Amazon for $10.17. Don't get ripped off by sellers who think this book is some rare find."
2,"Works OK, until it doesn't.","SpectronIQ has a 90 day warranty. How bad would your electronics have to be to break within 90 days? My DVD player lasted about 5 months of light use, then the battery bulged and would not stay in the unit. Look at the companies web site before you buy. To me, it seems they are counting on making money off the people who will buy non-name brand because it is super cheap. In the case of this company, I would say definitely think twice."
4,Great Value,This pot rack is attractive and a great value for the price. Be forewarned that it does not come with screws to attach it to the wall.
2,Not really green.,"I had other bulbs that were a green hue. not these. The lights work fine, just not green as advertised."
4,"""Bennett"" Fits Fine 'tween ""Backstreet"" and ""Brittney,"" Kids","Tony Bennett, at this point in his legendary career, is nearly incapable of making a poor album. Here, singing about, to, and for children, his work is especially elegant and empathetic. The title song, written by the Bergmans, is a jazzy piece of childhood nostalgia. His versions of ""All God's Chillen' Got Rhythm,"" (featuring a killer brush drum solo!) ""Paper Moon,"" and his versions of the Disney songs swing sweetly with help from the Ralph Sharon Trio. The final, unlisted track on my copy of the CD is ""Christmas in Herald Square,"" a New York sequel of sorts to ""The Christmas Song."" Bennett sings it beautifully. ""The Playground"" is a wonderful place for children and adults to spend time. It's an album Frank Sinatra never got the chance to do and Dean Martin, well...."
5,I couldn't put the book down! What an amazing gift she has!,I had a difficult time locating it but checked it out at the local library! What courage she has to use this gift and what a supportive family too. I look forward the her next book...I couldn't put it down and finished reading it within 3 hours!!! I certainly look forward to meeting her for a private reading!
5,Another Book on Kunitz's Crown,"Stanley Kunitz is one hundred years old this year and, if that it's not enough reason to rejoice, he's also published a book, thoughtfuy aided by Genine Lentine, in which he shares his two loves, gardening and writing poetry. And if I name these two passions of Kunitz's in such order is because the garden is at the center of his thought here.Accompanied by interesting photographs -some are remarkable portraits of Stanley- Kunitz words tell the story of his legendary Provincetown garden, and in the process he offers those lessons to his poetic insight.The result is a brief book of love for craft, in this case what caring after trees teaches you and what writing a poem entails and demands from his maker.I'm honored and elated to be reading some new words from such wise elder of the poetic word."
5,Great gift for any parent or gardener!,"I was back ""home"" with my folks this weekend and my dad really has been enjoying this book (shipped to him for Father's Day)as well. Mr. Kunitz reflections on his amazing life experience are outstanding. I fell in love with the book as well. Definitely give it 5 stars. Enjoy :)"
3,"Heavy weight, and very thick","The locket is a lot thicker than the pictures made it out to be. The chain is quite delicate for such a heavy locket. Design is very appealing, but the thickness and weight take somewhat away from it's appearance."
1,Sorry this one is not good,"I am a drama teacher and I bought this recently for our church. I only found one even slightly usable script in here. They were very unfunny and didn't teach a thing. I was expecially interested in the contents when I saw the part about lighting. It was all of one paragraph and totally useless. If this is ""The Best"", then I certainly wouldn't look any farther for their scripts."
5,These songs really soothe the soul!,"This CD gets better with every listen. Merle's voice is like velvet and has never sounded better. The strongest cuts (""The Way I Am"", ""Life's Just Not The Way It Used To Be"", ""Wake Up"") border on almost an ""easy listening"" (vs. honky-tonk) type of Country, but don't let that dissuade you. The lyrical content matched with Merle's powerful voice evoke strong emotions and the music is perfectly matched to them on every cut. There are no throw-aways. A great listen no matter what your mood - highly recommended!"
3,Mally Beauty Mattewand,"I was slightly disappointed with this product. No instructions were included and had I not read up on this, I wouldn't know the best use. Also, part of the wand, with the powder in, is not connected (glued) into the main part, making it a less than desirable tool."
2,KIDMAN FOR KIDS,"This is one of the few Nicole Kidman films you would let your kid watch. What could be more cool than riding a bicycle with walkie-talkies hanging out with a kid named Angelo D'Angelo? And then you discover your dad's Playboys and its all over. In this film some kids discover a case of walkie-talkies that belong to a group of robbers planning a job. The police want them too as the kids are stepping all over their police band. Can a group of kids on bikes thwart the robbers and the police?Ho-hum. Nothing like scenes of kids riding bicycles, popping wheelies, and out smarting adults.I am not sure kids today would even be interested in this film. And if you're a perv who stalks Nicole Kidman, you might want to pass on this one too unless you are also into bicycle seats. This was made before Kidman could act.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity."
1,bootlegs are no good,"(Bmx bandits) the quality was horrible!the sound went in and out,like someone took it straight off vhs.disappointed!Never even heard of the company it was made from deffinently a bootleg.I did'nt think amazon had bootlegers!they need to remaster it or something.can i get a special edition or something."
4,Bought for a gift. Really cute!,Bought this as a gift. I am sure that my cat loving friend will love this! She collects teapots. Really cute. Seems very well made. Nice purchase.
4,Hilariously cute cat teapot,"This makes an adorable gift for a cat lover.Hopefully it will stand up to frequent use?It can't help but bring a smile, its that hilariously cute!"
1,Yuck!,"I bought this necklace because I thought it was pretty and it had a great price. Well....when I opened the package I was very disappointed. It looked cheap and tacky up close and personal. Heck, it didn't look good from far away either. It was definitely not worth what I paid for it so I sent it back asap."
4,Tributes: good and bad,"If you love Queen but are a little bored of the 5 songs that they play on the radio, this is a good diversion. It's one of the better Tribute albums I've come across, mostly because it's NOT the original versions or someone TRYING to be Freddie in a bad way.Other Artists put their spin on A&B; Side classics done mostly in a Metal or Techno version, but is not limited to these. Most of the remixes are very well done: It's Late, We Will Rock You. Some I would even dare to say are better remixes than the ""Bonus Tracks"" on re-released Queen CDs, but a few of them have to be taken with a grain of salt: Save Me.I bought this brand new years ago and enjoyed it before it was stolen. It's only been recently that this rare album has become more available. Even if you're a purist when it comes to Queen, this definitely deserves a listen to."
1,Written with liberal bias,"From the Forward by Ramsey Clark to the end of the book one can not help but be startled by the very liberal bias of the writing. It reads like a ""do you still beat your wife?"" question. Howe uses his literary pulpit to preach a liberal sermon. This is the fourth book he published in the first six months of 1993 -- seems like a rush to judgement. While his conclusions may be correct, his poorly concealed radical disposition destroys the credibility of his arguments. A big disappointment."
5,An Oasis still refreshing,"I picked up this CD, blew off the dust, and started listening to it again after a couple of years. I have to say, this CD still sounds to me as fresh and rich as the day I got it. Incredibly rich, these songs can be listened to again and again without boredom. No surprise given that Ferrante and Lorber *both* wrote and played pieces on this album.They just don't make music like this anymore."
2,Instructions are sometimes incomplete or vague,"I have to go against the grain here. Other reviewers seem to like this book, but I don't think it's that great. I am an intermediate level Photoshop user and I feel that for what is essentially a ""cook book"" that some of the steps are missing or vague. Instructions like ""adjust to get the desired effect"" mean nothing. If I see an example of the effect I like in the book I want to know EXACTLY how to do it and not be left to guess. It is not what I consider a step-by-step book and some of the instructions tell you to do something and assume you know what to do. If you are a beginner, stay away from this book. If you are an intermediate user you may have some luck, but I'd look at other Photoshop type effets books."
5,A Tree for Peter,I was first introduced to this book 25 years ago in a childrens lit class and fell in love with the illustrations as well as the tender story of the relatioship between a young boy and a wise old man. Have searched since then to locate it. It's one of those timeless pieces.
4,Multiple covers for this DVD,"This is great if you are a U2 fan or just love The Joshua Tree album. Also if you are interested in the recording process. However, this also comes in a purple cover with the four faces of U2 on the left side. Make sure you don't buy both!"
1,A good framed,"I've got this DVD some months ago because I requested it to London. This DVD is only a making off of the Joshua Tree Album, so It hasn't the complete songs that it says. It's a very poor quality music DVD. Sincerously I wouldn't buy it."
3,Great insight into U2 music!,I love this collection of U2 thoughts BUT its not in dolby digital. Major draw back for a DVD.
5,Fun and clever,"Thomas Handforth spent time in China and had become aware of the differences between boy's privileges and girl's expectations. He is able to show that girls can generally do what boys can do in this book. He is recognized for advancing the role of women in children's literature. Another book of his, Faraway Meadow, is a clever study on learning to accept diversity. It is unfortunate that he died prematurely and was unable to write further. The world may have become more tolerant earlier in our history if he had been able to continue influencing it with his writing."
5,very comfortable,"Comfortable, adjustable and nice quality.They do not pinch or squeeze against my head even when they are under my ear muffs. Seeing is believeing and at the gun range you need to see. They have protected my eyes on numerous occasions from empty cartridges being ejected the my handguns. I chose the amber to block out the brighter lighting and to be able to see my flourescent targets with better clarity. They work just fine."
5,Don't Miss This Book if You Like Philosophy,"This is the best among several introductory books on the subject that I have read. Philosophers and related terms are clearly explained with the support of historical background. Nearly all philosophical ideas are introduced with both sides of the arguments. Sort of the story telling approach make those ideas easy to follow. I highly recommend it to those who want to learn more on philosophy, even for advanced students. I agree with the previous reviewer that one should consider it to be the only book on philosophy carrying aound with for reference. As the preface of the latest edition says, this subject can't be made simpler. Many thanks Mr. Popkin and Mr. Stroll for your great effort."
2,"yuck, wtf?","here it is plain and simple: [bad] songs, [bad] singing, YET, 2 awesome instrumentals... synopsis: waste of money. get the 2 instrumentals from a friend... i sold my copy within a week, peace..."
3,I liked the first one MUCH better.,"If you're investigating this CD because you're a Kings X fan then buy it. If you're investigating this CD because you're a Dream Theater or Planet X fan then skip it. I disagree with one of the other reviewers here. I thought this Platypus CD was less progressive than the first one. (The progressive epic ""Partial to the Bean"" sounds a lot like filler to me.) I also think the first one was heavier."
4,Wonderful cover,I won't comment on the medical accuracy of the advice given in the book. Others can provide a more well-informed critique than I. But what I do love about the book is its cover and title. This is the sort of book you can proudly display at your cubicle at work or coffee table at home. It's a great conversation starter. The sight of this book on your desk may embolden certain friends and co-workers to give you their best diet and exercise tips for avoiding constipation. It's a great way to get the conversation going on this important problem afflicting too many Americans today.
2,B.Gizzle down and out,"many people may not know this but this album was produced when b.g. was at his worst part of his life. he had a serious heroin addiction as you could tell by listening to his voice on the songs, and he had just been fired from cash money and now tryin desperately to stay in the game.thats why i think b.g. is a good rapper but this album wasnt so good because of his life situation.chech out b.gizzles newest album 'Life After Cash Money' talkin bout how he managed to get out of his hard situations such as when this album was released and go back on his feet."
5,B.G. KEEPS IT GANGSTA,"THIS BG'S 1ST ALBUM OFF CMR.HE SAYS F*** ALL DAT BLING BLING S***.HE KEEPS IT STREET AS HELL AND HE'S A TRUE KILLA AND DATS WHY I LIKE HIM.I'VE BEEN DOWN WIT HIM SINCE 99.THE 1ST SINGLE ""HOTTEST OF THE HOT"" IS A GOOD CLUB SONG & THE SECOND SINGLE ""KEEP IT GANGSTA"" IS OFF THE CHAIN.HE SHOWS HIS HOOD IN THE VIDEO AND HOLDS IT DOWN 4 V.L.

1,why is this popular?,While initially amusing it is senseless and teaches horrible morals. Even at the end the Skippyjon is still being defiant and is never once remorseful for his actions. You can use it as a jump start for conversations with your kids on how not to behave...however I would rather not read it to them and put the disrespectful and defiant attitude in their head/heart by reading it over and over to them.
4,One of the few....,"For me, there have always been those bands where I like them but can only listen to a few of the songs because of the lead singers voice. This would include Maroon 5, Billy Talent, and Clap Your Hands Say Yea. While I applaud these bands for being unique, it is hard to listen to an entire cd of it.Hot Hot Heat is one of the only exceptions I have ever had. I can listen to their cd's over and over and not have to stop after the 3rd or 4th track. While anything can become irritating, it takes Hot Hot Heat quite a while to get to me. I am also not a huge fan of these new English bands like Snow Patrol and Arctic Monkeys, but yet again Hot Hot Heat has something that just sticks with me. I recommend this cd as well as Make Up The Breakdown. Very good, upbeat songs that you will enjoy full-heartedly on a car ride home."
4,Elevator by Hot Hot Heat,"Hot Hot Heat is one of those bands that ooze coolness. Much like the Killers & The Strokes (clear inspirations), their blend of garage rock & pop hooks is infectious. Their talent is undeniable, and their latest picks up where Make up the Breakdown left off. However, this time around they have really stepped their game up. ""Goodnight, Goodnight"" would be comfortable alongside ""Bandages"" or ""No Not Now"". I was expecting the album to falter twards the end, but I was pleasently surprised to see that they were able to maintain the pace that ""Ladies & Gentleman"", ""You Owe Me an IOU"" & ""Running out of Time"" set at the beginning. The album title is a clear indication that this band is on the way up, and while they may get stopped at every other level as long as they stare clear of the ground floor I have no complaints."
1,Really I can't understand why these guys are popular,"Not to make anyone upset, but truthfully I can't stand these guys' music. Their voice in Goodnight, Goodnight sounds terrible... Everyone I've talked to likes these guys, but it's not my taste. Stop and actually listen to them, they stink."
5,Excellent,"Hot Hot Heat fans, if this isn't in your collection, it should be. Though later CD's feature lead guitarist, Luke Paquin, this CD is also quite good."
4,Great music - lame story plot,"I LOVED this as a kid, and since I still enjoy things from my childhood, I ordered it.My kids love it (3 1/2 yrs and 5 yrs), but now that I'm an adult I think the story is a bit lame... but it is a well done lame story. ;-) We listen to it often here. You do have to be careful though or you will be singing all day long, ""With a 'hip' and a 'hey' we're on our way, la la la la la la..."""
2,Excellent DVD but...............,"Excellent DVD as far as music is concerned. Footage is also quite good. The mass production of this DVD may have screwed up everything specially on ""Songbird"". The DVD stoped playing on this song, then it jumped, skipped, music stopped, Kenny G's face turned into different colors like a chameleon. Returned it for a replacement & the same exact thing happened. Is the maker of this DVD sleeping? Haven't they viewed & tested their own product before selling? Such a pity.........excellent DVD ruined by carelessness."
1,You have to tell us something,"You really do have to give us something of what songs are on this DVD , maybe some samples. Yes, we like Kenny G. but can easily pass to something else w/o knowing a thing except that it is 144 minutes...... sorry Kenny G......This review is the only way I could say something and they want more info than your DVD gave......"
3,"O.K. book, but not enough excitement","I am a 14 year old, and had to read this book for Honor's English over the summer. I got to pick the book, and I made the wrong choice. It is long and boring, and there is no excitement to make you want to keep reading. The book consists of James, the narrarator and author going to farms and treating animals. There are many complicated medical terms and half the time I didn't know what was going on with the aminal. It has its good parts, but they are few and far between. I wold not have finished it if I didn't have to."
2,All Creatures Great and Small,All Creatures is a GREAT book but this one was not suitable for the child I wanted to read it. Thank you for allowing me to return it. Theo Woods
5,A great timeless classic appropriate for all ages,"Having recently acquired a small farm, I thoroughly enjoyed reading Herriot's tales. And I have actually gained a great knowledge of animal care through his stories. A must read!"
5,All Creatures Great and Small,"I love James Herriot's books! I love all things 'veterinarian'. He makes the stories so personable, humorous, and touching. I'm looking forward to reading all his books."
3,Terrible transfer,"It's a bad-looking DVD. Non-anamorphic and murky, but watchable. Little more than just watchable..."
3,What Happened To Transylvania?,"I have nothing against this movie.It is actually very entertaining,but it just isn't like Dracula.In the older movies from the fifties and sixties,Dracula haunted people from awhile ago,in the 1800's,but now it takes place in the seventies.Christopher Lee's Dracula hair is really weird,but he still does the role good.Peter Cushing is his usual excellent self.But if this film didn't have either of them, i'm sure nobody would like it.If you want a classic Dracula film,see 'The Horror of Dracula""."
3,No subtitles? Hmmm...,"For a ""Special Deluxe Edition"", I would have expected at least english, spanish and french subtitles. Oops! No subtitles at all! Isn't that odd?"
3,So-so end to the Hammer Dracula cycle,"The final 'Dracula' movie from Hammer Films, it's not quite as good as previous efforts and budget constraints are painfully evident. The premise is just as appealing to me as it was when I first saw this film nearly 20 years ago now--it can be summarized as Dracula Meets The Avengers, as the vampire lord plans to unleash a deadly plague on the Earth--although I think Dracula's death is probably the most embarrasing any vampire has ever suffered.Peter Cushing shines as brightly as ever, although Christopher Lee seems a bit tired in the film. It might be a reflection of Dracula's own mindset, but it's more likely the actor's disastifaction with the role shining through. The scene with the vampire brides of Dracula rising from their caskets and surrounding one of the main characters remains intensely frightning to me."
2,Lousy video/audio quality.,Poor video/audio quality.As if someone discreetly copied this movie with an old-fashioned 8mm camera.Better quality versions available out there.
3,Not Bad!,I've always liked the old dracula movies. I only paid $1.00 for this one at Wal-Mart so I definitely got my moneys worth. It's worth watching. A good movie for it's time.
1,The Satanic Rites of Stupid,"This is what Christopher Lee was complaning about for most people who don't know this Christopher Lee hated doing Dracula for Hammer they would make up stories first and try to fit the character into the script. after ""Horror of Dracula"" all those other Dracula Movies were just Dracula - Themed Stories He didnt want that Lee wanted Bram Stoker he wanted to be Bram Stoker's Dracula but he ended up doing a original movie and 6 Dracula - Themed Sequels"
3,Surprisingly entertaining!!! Good quality for the price!,"I was plesently surprised by the film. Although no masterpiece, the plot was very entertaining and bizarre. (I liked the ""Vampire Brides"" who are kept in the cellar!) In fact, the film was quite good on all levels until the extremely disappointing final few minutes of the film. Nevertheless, I found this movie to be much more entertaining than Taste the Blood of Dracula, Dracula Has Risen from the Grave and the dreadfully awful Scars of Dracula.As for the quality of this budget DVD, it was pretty good for the price. Picure quality isn't nearly as good as the DVDs being put out by the big studios, but it is much better than the cheepie VHS tapes that used to sell for this price. Unfortunately, the DVD has no extras, not even a trailor. But for this price, you can't go wrong!"
2,SAD FAREWELL TO DRACULA,"This is the last Chris Lee ""Dracula"" film and I think they KNEW IT when they made it.The only two ROTTEN ""Hammer Dracula's"" are ""SCARS OF DRACULA"" and this one...the rest were pretty good and deserve their ""classic"" status.This flick COULD have been decent, but it looks cheap and has NO style AT ALL!Hammer was known for their rather stylish, beautiful sets and photography...this has the look of a TV movie...from the 70s!What's weird is that it has some of the best actors in the UK (at the time) in it, giving it all as much as they could.The script has MANY missed opportunities, but maybe, now that you've read this and the other reviews you can watch it without any big expectations.That's the ONLY way to enjoy this flick.Oh yeah...!This edition has THE best ""cover-art"" I've ever seen for this film...theatrical or video...it's beautifully done!"
1,Kinda Weak Overall,A little bit of a sad attempt at making clever short films. I had a chance to watch the trailer: [...] and I guess for an indie project it's just ok. I think ICIZZLE should rename himself to IFIZZLE. thanks for the try at comedy. Maybe on another planet this is funny but not on earth.
4,A great book,"I loved this book--an inspiring story that conveys the excitment of the exploration of the west. Author includes historical background so Fremonts actions are placed in the context of the time. Very readable--almost like a novel. The one drawback are the maps of Fremonts explorations. They are merely sketch maps without any location detail--I would have liked to have seen more detailed cartography with, perhaps, landforms included. Many (most) place names in the book are not shown on the maps. I kept my atlas at hand while reading, but many place names have changed. I strongly recommend."
5,56K Modem,"The ActionTec 56K dial-up modem, is excellent product. It is very fast, connects quicklly, and the signal is very strong, a good product, I would reconmend it, if you use a 56K modem."
5,Look Out Momma There's A White Boat Comin Up The River,"Powderfinger, the track from which those lyrics are drawn, is the clear standout here. The song can transport you to another place and time for a few minutes in a way that only Mr. Young can do.There are other tunes on here that I really enjoy, but the electric guitar and haunting voice on Powderfinger define this album for me.Thank you, Neil."
5,Great movie!,"This movie definitely has twists and turns not expected when you first watch it. These runners planned this run before the political events were to unfold. As the movie plays on, the theme of how the country felt at this time becomes evident. There is no way to understand the people of this country than to cross this land on foot. Is this a tough run to accomplish? Assuredly. But there is more depth to this movie than the running, as if that is needed. This is an engaging movie."
3,Basic but Good Value,"I needed an adequate pen pad of a slightly larger format, but didn't have the money to go for a professional layout. This one was right in between and at a very good price.My concern came from others responses about having trouble getting the drivers to work with Win 7. Once I figured out that the manufacturer was UCLogic I was able to find their driver pack online. Rather than loading the disk that came with the pad, I ran the download drivers and everything fell into place.I use the pad with Serif Draw Plus (English software)and find it fully functional. I still haven't figured out (due to the limited instruction guide) how to program the many User Defined folders indicated at the margins of the pad, but all the other programmed selection options seem to work fine with my software.Don't be concerned about driver problems, just get the latest from the web and this will be a nice format for most applications."
1,Beware of this vendor...,"THIS PRODUCT IS NOT FROM BLACK AND DECKER... I assumed that this is from Black and Decker, seeing the product caption, but i was surprised to find no hint of black and decker any where on the product or the other manuals. I havent used the product yet but my first impresion is very bad and i will not recomend this vendor."
1,Very Disappointing!!!,This book feels like a big PR piece for the writer who sounds like an egomanic. He does not even seem to understand the whole idea of game play! Some sort of washed up screenwriting teachier trying to apply his ideas to game development. I found this book almost unreadable - the ego and references to his life really get in the way. You have to really sift through so much attitude and filler to get to any points that are generally covered in most screenwriting books - but far better.Buy this book if you want an expensive ad for David Freeman.
2,Very disturbed by the reviews here,"This book has about 10 anonymous, 5 star reviews that all sound the same. I'm VERY suspicious that these are fake reviews.I've read parts of this book and I understand why most of the non-anonymous reviewers have problems with it. While it has some interesting aspects, it doesn't go very in depth and the amount of ridiculous buzzwords (like Emotioneering) make it hard to swallow."
2,How to Hire the Freeman Group,"If you want to learn to write, pick any Writer's Digest book on the topic of your choice and you'll be fine.If you want to design a game, I recommend just about any other book with the word ""game"" in the title. You won't learn any of that here.On the other hand, if you want to know how to hire David Freeman and the Freeman Group, this book is for you.In general, there are 2 types of ""How to"" book: 1) ""How you"" books, which actually try to teach you something; and 2) ""How I"" books, which explain how the author will do what he does as soon as you hire him to do it.This is definitely a ""How I"" book.Finally, any book that sums up the plot of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" as ""Two Major Characters Change Places"" (capitalized because this is one of the vaunted ""1500 Emotioneering Techniques"") is not going to teach you anything useful."
1,Fake reviews?,"I've worked in the game industry, and like many other recent reviewers, I have doubts about many of the positive reviews for this book. Too many of them 1. are written by someone who gives his job title but not a name, 2. are written by someone has written no other reviews, 3. are written in the same gee-whizz-buy-this style. Interestingly, none of them show the insight into the games industry an insider would have (the book's author is a consultant with very limited experience) and none of them refer to the books considerable faults, which have made it rather more disliked than otherwise by professionals."
5,Great on Steaks,"I buy this 6 at a time as I hate to broil up a steak without it. I think this rub is wonderful, spicy but not too hot, well-blended and interesting on roasted and broiled meat."
2,no more shopping sprees for me,"I'll admit it I was on a spending spree when I picked this up expecting good music again since writings and survivor were great, despite beyonce's weak solo album, big mistake! Lose My Breath, Through With Love and Girl were the only good songs on the CD. They're very very talented ladies with voices but the music did not reflect that at all. They're going the same route en vogue were going as they faded towards the end of the 90's as a group despite the talent."
4,I really like this album!!!!,"I think vocally since they have been apart they've really grown. It's nice to hear all of the girl sing and not just Beyonce. Don't get me wrong, Beyonce my girl but when you're in a group, everyone has their own particular style and they should be given a chance to shown the style so that fans can identify with who ever they like. I'm very glad that Kelly and Michelle got a chance to do some singing on this album. I especially like ""If"" and ""Love"", the vocally arrangement in those songs are so pretty. This by far is the best album vocally the girls have done."
3,Could Have Been SOO much better,"This was a let down, but still one of the best R&B; albums of 2005. Destiny Fulfilled feels like something for fans to listen to until Beyonce makes her second solo album.Must Listens (Or should i say, only listen to these)-T-shirt-Is She the Reason-Through wit love (should have been a single, its their best song)-Game Over (Not on the regular CD DOWNLOAD IT!)"
5,From a rockers point of view...dc r amazing!,"Well i am not a whole fan of the RNB side or anything like that, but My dad got it for me as a present , usually destiny's child dont flatter me, but this album is amazing it truely is!. It has such meaning the harmonies are amazing its truely changed me.This album is amazing offcoarse its not an album if you want to party to its an album to relax to and it helps you, i am proud to say i am a Destiny's Child fan!I recomend all rockers to buy it and anyone who dont usually like destiny's child to buy it. its changed me!..it is amazing!Dc are now fulfilled and they help me fulfill my destiny. so id liek to thank them for such an amazin album!"
4,This Cd is great!,"I really like this CD, its something new from Destiny's Child. Its more r&b its great. The songs are very powerful & kelly's voice has REALLY grown, she's a very good singer. Too bad I can't say the same for Michelle, that's why i gave it a 4 because michelle sounds very very bad in some songs, but overall it's worth the money. Get the CD!!!!"
1,its over a review from kevin f,destiny child drop from my heart i thought they will surprise me with this cd but they brooke my heart i gusse destiny child are over with my heart i will never like destiny chil agin thats how bad this cd is
2,Worth the money?,"Let's be realistic people. This is not Destiny's Child, and it hasn't been since The Writing's on the Wall. And sorry to say it, but has anyone heard Michelle sing? It's AWFUL. In ""Lose My Breath"", I can't even understand what she's saying...""Consay dishay ooh?"" translation? ""Can you make me say ooh?"" The other members try to mesh her voice in, but when it's that terrible, it's hard to. Don't waste your money on this rushed and halfassed project- as an MSNBC article said of the girls' attitude- ""We always insisted we would do another group project together after going solo, so here it is, obligation taken care of, now let's move on with our lives."""
4,Very nice!,"Beyonce's voice is amazing. Kelli's voice is amazing. Like so many of the reviewers, I too was hoping that Michelle would have had just a little more of a chance this time around--more than just the bridges or the shortest verse--but even she, believe me, definitely shines. It is a VERY nice CD.""Lose My Breath"" ""Soldier"" and ""If"" are the hottest cuts. In fact, ""If"" is the one song that will remind any listener about why DC is so successful. Their individually unique voices blend powerfully and amazingly well, so much that it's chilling. This is a classic DC CD worth having, and I definitely recommend."
2,Terrible!,"When i first heard Lose My breath i felt it was too poppy, somethin that britney spears wuold sing! But, i let it grow on me and its the only song ony the CD that i like. I don't like the message that Cater 2 U conveys, but i like the rhythm, harmony, and beat. U can tell the Cd was made in 3 weeks. I think the only reason they made this album was to fulfill their promise 2 each other and 2 the fans, not because their hear twas in it. I mean, wut need do they have 2 be 2gether? They're engaged, and Beyonce's solo career is at the top of its game. I'm still fans of the girls, but i think its time to let Destiny's Child go."
3,destinys child fanatic,"Personally I thought the destinys child album was alright but I thought that they could have done better. These are the following songs that I like: Bad habit,Through with love,Lose my breath, Soldier, Cater 2 u,Free, and t-shirt. Songs like If, Girl, and If she's the reason are stupid. On this album I think that they were trying to show the more maturer side of them,but I still like there old albums better especially Survivor and Iam sad to know that they are breaking up to me Beyonce has a better voice then Kelly and Michelle, but the person with the worse voice is michelle and iam going to feel sorry for michelle when destinys child break's up."
2,Better off Solo or try again,"I was very very dissappointed with this purchase.2nd to last song i really really like especially the end. All three of the girls have capable voices and im not hating on them at all. This album however is in fact a waste of my money. Beyonce must have used all the good songs on dangerously in love, this album was slightly less than mediocore, especially considering the previous DC albums have been top notch."
1,Destined to be remembered as an En Vogue Rip Off,"I have played this over and over and for the life of me I cannot imagine the record company releasing this piece of [...]. The single ""Lose My Mind"" is outstanding (and a bit slutty - but that's always fun) - but the rest of this record is just plain bad. I can't fathom them milking ""Soldier"" as a second single (talk about taking advantage). I actually had high hopes for this recording - but no matter how you cut the cake - this one crumbles. The ballads are so boring that you just want to take it off - which I am sure most people are doing."
3,Beyonce Go Solo,"All this album proves is that Beyonce needs to leave those two chicks behind and go for what she knows. Every song is overpowered by her potent voice, and Kelly and Michelle sound like hired back up singers. Girl, please move on. We know who the star is!"
2,WORST CD,"THIS IS DESTINY'S CHILD WORST CD EVER. ITS A GOOD THING THEY ARE SPLITTING UP. MICHELLE NEEDS TO FIND ANOTHER CAREER CAUSE SINGING AINT GO PAY HER BILLS. MAN SHE SOUND HORRIBLE. SHE SING LIKE HER THROAT IS DRY. SOUNDS LIKE SHE IS FALLING TO SLEEP AS SHE IS SINGING. MAN SHE CANT SING.....KELLY SINGS BETTER THAN BEYONCE, BUT YOU WILL NEVER KNOW BECAUSE BEYONCE WRITE ALL OF THE LEADS FOR HERSELF. I'LL ADMIT ITS A COUPLE OF SONGS O\ON THE CD THAT I LIKE, BUT THATS IT"
1,Nothing fulfilled here but disappointment!,"I have enjoyed all of DC's other albums and each one has always had tracks on it that the group could have done without (as with most albums) but Destiny Fulfilled is a sad representation of what these ladies can do with their talents. I think anyone who purchases the CD will soon be wondering why they ever took the time to get it. There are a few good tracks such as the radio mega-play ""Lose My Breath"" and the slow and very sexy ballad ""T-shirt"" but overall Destiny Fulfilled is not going to be listed as anything great for 2004 or 2005. If this album was put together in a rush...it certainly shows! It doesn't come close to the other albums put out by DC over the years and the group may receive some negative feedback from their fans, this is truly NOT even a percentage of their best. I wish I had saved my money and waited for the ""bootleggers"" to hop on the net with it....it is not at all worth paying for."
3,Need More,I rushed to the store to pick up this ablum thinking it would be hot. I popped it in and after it was done.. i was like what... I need more. It's okay.. it would be cool if it was the 1st CD. I think this was a miss. I am only giving it a 3 b/c i am a fan. But if this was anyone else it would be a 2.
2,MISSION COMPLETE,"The girls always said that after their solo efforts, they would do another Destiny's Child CD. Well, here it is....and it sucks. This CD is nothing but leftover music from ""Survivor"". And ""Cater 2 U""? From my ""Independent Women""? Just say no!!!!"
2,Destiny UNfulfilled!,"I bought this cd on the strength of ""Lose My Breath"", which is a great track. The rest of the album is one sloooooooow jam after another. I like two additional songs (""Bad Habit"" and ""Through With Love""), but the rest sounds like scraps leftover from Beyonce's album. What I want to know is what happened to our independent women? The girl's here are love sick and whipped, as evident on ""Cater 2 U"" and ""T-Shirt"". Honestly, it's an ok album, but it sounds like was recorded in a week with absolutely no thought put into it. Can we say ""contractual obligation""?"
2,Blah,"So, I'm a huge fan of Destiny's Child. Gone to the live shows, bought all the CDs (group and solo), have the T-shirt and Valentine Cards. I am so disappointed by this album.The obvious good tracks: ""Lose My Breath"", ""Soldier"", ""Through with Love."" They could get away with saying this is a ""successful"" record just by releasing those singles, but let me tell you the rest is boring, bland, uninspired and did I say boring?Don't waste your money, they don't need it. They'll get enough by pushing McDonald's down their fans throat, which we all know is a really healthy thing to be promoting to young fans."
3,JUST OKAY,"Well, I don't know what to say. I guess this album is okay. I've listened to this album about five times and it's grown on me. The songs are okay and you can tell that they've matured lyrically. My favorite songs are CATER 2 U and FREE. This album is different from their other albums. The songs on this albums are more R&B where their other three albums were mostly POP. The only thing I hate is they're sounding more and more like Beyonce. Beyonce was the vocal producer for the album. In my opinion, Kelly is the better singer. Overall, the album is not bad."
3,Average,"I will not turn this review into a bash Beyonce fest, but it is clear to me that she did not want to return to Destiny Child. However, she has and this is the result of her choice. There is NOTHING awesome about this cd. Its only okay. Only five songs are worth mentioning. ""Lose My Breath"" is an instant classic, ""Soldier"" is only okay, ""Cater 2 U"" is nice, ""T-Shirt"" is great and ""Through With Love"" shows the best in all three women. The other songs serves as filters. This cd is more R&B driven like their first cd and they have grown as artists and women, so I have to give mad respect for that. But this cd did not fulfill me. If this is what they had in them to offered, then maybe they should have not reunited."
3,HIT....and....MISS Project,"Finally, they are back. This album contains some good jams, and some songs that are quite embarrasing.1. Lose My Breath 5/52. Soldier 5/53. Cater 2 U 1.5/54. T-Shirt 3/55. Is She The Reason 5/56. Girl 4.5/57. Bad Habit 2/58. If 4.5/59. Free 5/510. Through With Love 5/511. Love 5/5Not their best, but if you are prepared to dig deep, and let it grow on you, you'll be glad you bought it."
2,Destiny's Child,"There is only one song that I liked in this CD: Lose My Breath, which I heard over a million times! I dont really like this CD t all."
1,Corny&you don't go back,"Beyonce has a Hit Career&also has expanded into other areas of Entertainment so unless this is a Greatest Hits Live Set or a Final Project why even bother doing the Group Project again? these Songs seem formulated&contrived.had they dropped this two years back then maybe but now it's Corny.Beyonce needs to find Her ""Control"" Like Janet Jackson did back in the day."
2,Don't Bother,"One the the year's major disapointments. It's all downhill after Lose My Breath; I have barely listened to this CD. This group's best effort was ""Writing on the Wall"" (one of the best R&B albums of the past 10 years) and they have yet to match the quality of that effort, which, incidentally, was made by a virtually different group. And related to that point, will somebody please tell me who's idea it was for this Michelle woman to be in the group? How did this happen? Did anyone actually attend her vocal audition? Hopefully this will indeed allow them to fulfill their destiny by being their last album. Can't wait for Beyonce's next solo project."
4,Not As Good As Past Albums,"I was looking forward to a more upbeat album from Destiny's Child. This one was definitely a ballad album. But I will say it's definitely a more mature Destiny's Child. I love the fact that you can listen to them all individually on the tracks. Not what I anticipated, but all in all still a great buy. These girls still rock!"
5,DC3 back 2 its Roots,"I absolutely love and totally love this album (and not because i'm a Destinys Child fan)..this has to be my favorite DC3 album since their debut album. Destiny Fullfilled is DCR back to its roots in their first album when the group was all about R&B.; Even though the second and third album was going kinda the pop direction, this album completely surprised me with the more R&B; flavor.I liked every song on the album, except ""Girl"". Not that its a bad song, but its just not my groove....yet (maybe if i listen to it more). My favorite songs are: ""Lose My Breath"", ""Soldier"", ""Cater 2 U"", ""If"" & ""Free"".The other surprising fact is that EVERYONE sings on the album..not only Beyonce..so all u haters, stop hating and start appreciating...and by the way, I loved Michelle voice just fine. She's not as strong vocally as the other members, but her voice suits every song on the album just fine.Seriously though, if ur a DC3 fan or not or like R&B; flavoured songs..this is the album 4 u!!!"
2,Look for something newer - insightful,I was disappointed in this book. It was published in 2001 but the material and focus seemed to be on technology available in the early 90's. The tips were pretty basic (don't clean lenses etc. on the set; do it in another room so you don't spill anything near/on the set) - no kidding. Save your money - browse through it at the library for a day before ordering and you'll see what I mean.
5,"If you write, here's an inexpensive secret weapon","This one's for everyone - fiction and non-fiction. You pick up this slim paperback, rifle the pages and bang! A Manual of Writer's Tricks gives you ammunition to instantly liven your writing. My copy is well-highlighted. The foreword is written by literary agent Sheree Bykofsky who once sent me a delightful rejection letter. Some examples (I just gave you one - irony); Show don't tell - instead of ""the ship was heavily weighted,"" say ""Excess cargo made her tilt slightly to port."" Use words that evoke images - instead of ""my back is sore all over,"" say ""I ache along every nerve ending and vertebra of my spine."" You get the picture, now go get the book."
2,Angry. Cranky. Shallow.,"John Hagee has a well-deserved reputation as a man of faith and a servant of God. His reputation and good work certainly shine much brighter than this particular book which seems small, cranky, and a little bit mean.I am certain that the good pastor knows that God is on the throne and well in charge, even of Jerusalem. The middle east is God's timepiece for the world. What is about to occur there has already been foretold and is unfolding before our eyes in these last days. Matthew 5 would admonish us to pray for, bless, and even love the very militant muslims who would unleash destruction on Israel.I read ""Countdown to Jerusalem"" for God's word about the end-times, not celebrity quotes from Rush Limbaugh and Cal Thomas. There are many good books about the future of Israel. This is not one of them.I recommend Paul Yongi Cho's ""Apocolyptic Prophecy"" instead."
2,"A Weak ""No-Goody""","A big disappointment. I always remebered ACE combs to be a bit more sturdy. Ace was really good for combing out those morning kinks (because somebody was too lazy to roll their hair last night). The tines were not as long as they should have been, either. I don't think that this particular comb is sturdy enough to keep in my purse, as I can see it broken already. Might as well get a cheapie from dollar store."
2,always slate,every week my tv guide arrives late. if this continues I will cancel my order and just buy it at the local market.
3,It's okay,"It is okay, but I have not started to receive the tv guide yet. I am not sure if it's the tv guide magazine or the tv guide with tv listings."
2,TV Guide subscription,"As a new subscriber, I am very disappointed with the content of TV Guide. The program listings cover only the 8:30-11:30PM time period instead of the all-day listings they had provided for a long time. I will not be renewing the subscription because of this limited information in the magazine."
2,"Better than nothing, maybe",Hard to use. Poorly set up and not as good as what the newpaper puts out. I guess I wanted someting like the guide used to be.
3,TV Guide,"Product's schedules start in the evening on Saturday and Sunday leaving sports, movies, etc to hit and miss. Too much ""junk"" about celebrities. Price is right."
2,TV Guide does not guide very well,"I used to buy TV Guide back when it was a smaller-sized (although no less pages) magazine. That was likely twelve years ago or thereabouts so I actually do not remember how many channels the magazine listed. I seem to think that it listed most every local channel. I subscribed a few months ago because the CHICAGO TRIBUNE no longer includes a television magazine in the weekend newspaper.. One can subscribe separately but TV GUIDE is half the price. However, it does not list all local channels - does not list all the local PBS channels nor does it list ""ME-TV"" or other channels. Thus, I still do not know what is on television unless I check the cable program guide channel. Suffice it to say that I will not be renewing my subscription."
1,Not a TV guide anymore,I subscribed for years but doesn't live up to its name anymore. Very limited television show listings - covers prime time only and limited channels. Not very useful.
1,Bummed!,Only gotten two or three magazines and that's it. I paid for a year not a month. What's the deal?????
3,nice to have,I had no tv guide during the summer because nothing was on that I wanted to watch but I did want to hear about the new shows coming on so I started taking it again. Glad I did. It is full of infor about all the new shows.
2,Too many double issues,What I liked about TV Guide was getting it weekly. Now along with other weekly magazines (Entertainment Weekly) they do about 10 double issues through out the year. This counts as two weeks worth of issues. So almost every month you will get only 3 issues instead of 4 due to one of their 'special double issue' makes me not want to renew.
3,Small window of listings,The TV Guide magazine is for my wife. It replaces the newspaper guide which is now priced too high. The TV Guide starts at 08:00 PM Eastern time. It has no day time listings therefore the listing window is small compared to the total TV broadcast time- around the clock 24/7.Also my wife is not too interested in the stories and crossword puzzle. She would like more listings and less fluff.
5,the best israeli novel about metal and mental i've read,"i've pretty much given up hope in the novel these days--but this one restores some faith. the german version has a much better cover, but you've gotta read it in english to get the jokes. vive!"
5,Metafiction Without the Chalky Aftertaste,"Enter Gilad Elbom, purveyor of dark ramblings and metal-infused interludes, straight from the heart of Israel. In this freshman release from an up-and-coming literary powerhouse we find Elbom, also the main character of Scream Queens, reflecting on his life inside a mental hospital as an assistant nurse. Through driven dialogue and off-beat characters we plunge into a world of mental instability and quirky obsessions where we are often lost between insanity and reality. A fun, tight novel told through the eyes of a self-deprecating (albeit self-involved) Israeli national, Scream Queens of the Dead Sea is bound to be a cult hit."
5,I love to sing Bill's Praises,"Unlike the Flaming Liberals who have not read Bill O'Reilly Book,I read the book and have nothing but great praise for it. Bill tells it like it is. Most folks cannot handle it. That's why they do not have what it takes to win in life. Bill O'Reilly shares with us what brought him down and what built him up. Attitudes, behavior can either serve you or ruin you. Kudos to Bill for helping us focus on what kind of communication is going to take us where we want to go. Bill is an all around good guy, sharing his wealth of experience and knowledge.As Bill O'Reilly states in his book, We are in dire need of community around us that will look out for our best interest.At times Bill O'Reilly is also a wealth of entertainment as he shoots down the bad guy, It really makes me smile. Thanks Bill for another good read!"
1,"This is not a book, it's a coaster","Wow, what a dissapointment. I cannot beleive it was even published. Trust me it will take you 5 minutes to read it. Don't waste a penny."
1,Old merchandise,The batteries appeared new but would not hold a charge. They evidently had exceeded their shelf life. I had to purchase some locally to get the phones working.
5,Realistic view for those of us that weren't there . . .,"I first read this book my freshman year of high school for honors History class. I must say, at the age of 14 I found the book overwhelming. Tauber gives what I now know are very accurate depictions of the social environment of the 60's/70's. The characters come to life in such a way that one can identify with them and understand the emotions of the time. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand the social atmosphere of the 60s/70s. For anyone who wasn't grown or even born at this time, reading this book will give you such a great insight into what was going on and why it was such a turbulent time in our history."
5,Peter Pan,"I had only seen a movie of Peter Pan, but the book ""Peter Pan and Wendy"" is infinitely better. I am taking a course on children's literature, and this was required reading. The book has so many more details, and seems to be written more for adults than children."
2,Hollow platitudes from a research spokesman,"The author makes statements about the humane use of animals in research, but never admits any abuse done to them by any researcher, ever. For a fairer picture of animal experimentation, I'd recommend Barbara Orlans ""In the name of Science: Issues in responsible animal experimentation"" or Andrew Rowan's ""Of Mice, Models, and Men: A critical evaluation of animal research""."
3,will it stand the test of time?,"The shirt itself is a decent material, but the imaging printed on it seems a little ""flimsy"". Although it hasn't even been washed yet, I can tell that it will need delicate care to maintain it's image over time.The printing on the shirt is not as dynamic as the pictures leads you to believe. The colors were a little weaker than what was pictured. Other than that, it has a cool dragon on it! :)"
3,Montgomery's cop-out,"I love Anne but I've always felt that L M Montgomery's depiction of her degenerated in the later books. Anne was happy having children but I don't believe that meant Anne had to sacrifice all her dreams and talent to the altar of Gil and children (not to mention Susan). I hated how Anne would constantly put herself down. It is almost as though L.M. Montgomery was saying that girls could not have it all. It's awful how Anne would say things like ""I had wonderful dreams when I was younger, but I'll never make Who's Who"", or how she never even made an attempt at writing Captain Jim's life-story, saying something like ""I know what I can do, I can only write fairy stories....."", which implies that it was beyond her. Anne topped the batch in English at Redmond and her talents in her youth were prodigious. It is cop-out for Montgomery to have condemned Anne to life as a doctor's wife in a provincial town. Her creative potential was never fulfilled."
4,a good book,"I am so happy that in this book anne finnally married gilbert. she helps leslie, and has her first child,jem,but anne could of followed her dreams more."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money!,"If you like the GR games don't buy this one, it is the worst one of them all. No more is the 3rd person view and slow walk. Focusing with the scope is way to slow to even use it at times. Now it's like you walk around like a robot, very choppy and stiff....it even started to lag during the campaign. I loved all the other ones, but this one (for black xbox) is garbage. So save your money and buy a better game."
4,Wicked Jaguar,"I recently heard Wicked Game on the Jaguar X-Type commercial and went nuts trying to find out the artist until my step son told me it was Chris Isaac. I knew I had heard the song a couple times before in movies and sure enough a search showed it was used in ""The Family Man"" and ""Wild at Heart"". What ever CD you get Wicked Game on you can't go wrong."
5,A Good Book!,This was a book that made an impression on me. The newspaperreporter writes a story that gets a CIA operative in big trouble.He learns after the fact that the information he has used was false information supplied by the Russians. From here it is nonstop action for our reporter. This book also gives you a very good idea about the power of the press and how it can be manipulated to achieve various means and goals.Through this book you go to several locations worldwide. The characters in the story are also well written. This is a good book that you willenjoy very much. Buy it and read it. It is a winner.
1,disappointment,I didn't get pass 5 minutes in this movie. Why the bad language?! It was no cause for it. I was so excited to watch this movie and then here comes the bad language. What for? The boy was using God's name in vain like nothing. Huge disappointment.
4,"Impressed, Yet Again","This cd is definately the biggest surprise out of all of Madonna's releases. You really start to think that Madonna has honestly changed, and then you hear Act of Contrition, and all of your new feelings about her fly right out the window. It's very hard to describe the track, but I'll do my best without spoiling it. She starts out quietly praying and then all of a sudden loud guitars start blaring, the chorus of ""Like A Prayer"" is played in reverse, and Madonna's prayer is exposed for what it really is. All I can say is that I was laughing out load for a good 10 minutes after I heard it. It's not dirty, just funny. This track absolutely makes me love Like A Prayer. Very cool, Madonna."
5,THE EIGHTIES AT ITS BEST,"THIS ALBUM PROVED THAT MADONNA WAS MORE THAN A POP TART. THIS ALBUM REALLY PROVED SHE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY. I THINK LOTS OF PEOPLE WERE SUPRISED AT HOW GOOD A SONGWITER SHE WAS. THESE SOUND HAVE SO MUCH HEART AND LEAVE YOU WITH YOUR HEAD A MESS. OH FATHER TIL THIS DAY STILL REAMINS MY FAVORITE MADONNA BALLAD. ITS SO HAUNTING AND SAD, YET A VERY SIMPLE SONG. I AGREE WITH MANY OTHERS YOU COULD NO LONGER DENY THE TALENT THIS WOMAN POSSESSED. I WAS ONLY 11 WHEN THIS WAS RELEASED AND IT STILL REMAINS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MADONNA DISCS TO DATE."
3,nice effort,"the strongest songs on this album overshadow anything madonna had done before because of their high energy and songwriting, but this album as a whole does not have songs you can listen to all without skipping like the 3 previous albums which is probably why her album sales went down from how much true blue soldstrong songs:Like a PrayerExpress YourselfCherishOh FatherDear JessiePray for Spanish Eyes"
4,Classic Madonna,"For awhile now I was mostly a fan of Madonna's current work with ""Ray of Light"" and ""Music"" but lately I have been influenced to delve deeper into her large catalog. ""Like A Prayer"" is the last album she would do straight-forward pop before moving on to incorporating different genres of music with pop music like the r&b-influenced; sound on ""Bedtime Stories"".After listening to the original versions of ""Like A Prayer"" and ""Express Yourself"" (as opposed to the IC's versions), I can't say I prefer one version over the other. Both songs are great, remixed or not. I didn't particularly care for ""Love Song"", otherwise I would have given this cd a 5-star review. I don't think that was one of Madonna's better songs overall. ""Til Death Do Us Part"" is excellent, one of my favorite non-single tracks off this overall excellent album. Asides from ""Love Song"", I love ""Like A Prayer"". It is definitely one of Madonna's better albums pre-""Ray of Light""."
3,Monotone,"The narrator on this story is boring and all the voices are pretty monotone. I am an autism teacher and my students love ""Miss Nelson is Missing"" but they don't like this one as much because the characters are not as animated and there are less sound effects with this story as compared to ""Miss Nelson is Missing."" We still enjoy the story, just not the CD as much."
4,Square in a Square by Jodi Barrows,"I great find. Jodi really knows what she is doing. The ruler and her books have intrigued me and I finally saw her demo and immediately bought them both. Any one interested in quilting should check her work out, whether a beginner or seasoned quilter you will be amazed. Instructions are easy to follow and they also include diagrams for visual help. Keep up the good work!"
5,one of the best spoken word cds available!,"While living in the Bay Area of California we were lucky enough to have a radio station that rebroadcast Canada's CBC radio station. ""The Shepherd"" read by Alan Maitland was a special on Christmas Eve for a number of years and we made sure to tune in each year. Living now in an area we cannot receive the broadcast we have bought the disk and now have our own tradition playing it for ourselves and friends on Christmas Eve. Makes a wonderful gift and stocking stuffer. Recommended highly."
4,this is great stuff,"I came late to William Kennedy's work and may have to take other reviewers at their word that this is not his best. But it's certainly pretty good, and I'll find out if the rest is better. He captures a kind of crazed picaresque worldview which is something like E.L. Doctorow on drugs. His disasters are gigantic, larger than life, and so are most of the characters. It's hard to tell if it's magical realism or just totally unlikely, but it's funny as hell and a tremendously fun and quick reading experience--in spite of the mass violence and misfortune and desperate poverty it describes."
5,Unbelievably Informative!,"When I saw Why Do Cockatiels Do That from the comical picture on the front I thought it would just be an amusing book about cockatiels. I was wrong! This is a very informative book written in a lighthearted way. I have two cockatiels and I found out things about my birds I never knew. I couldn't understand why they didn't like to take baths, for example, and learned that they are from a more desert type area of Austrailia so it's not in them to like to bathe the way it is with parakeets. I have other books on cockatiels but this one was not only informative but fun to read."
1,Virtually Unlistenable,"The U.S. release of this CD has been delayed numerous times over the past six months, obviously not for re-mixing because the result is virtually unlistenable. One of the best aspects of Mary Black's past efforts has been the seamless cohesion of her outstanding voice with her band. ""Adam at the Window,"" ""Past the Point of Rescue"" and ""Might as Well Be a Slave"" are great examples. This CD, however, sounds like it was recorded off a kareoke machine. I would have thought that a Mary Black recording of the truly beautiful ""Fall at Your Feet"" would be something to look forward to, but this CD sent me diving back to the original Crowded House version to wash that sound out of my ears. Likewise for the title track. ""Message of Love"" is truly grating, and ""Big Trip To Portland"" sounds like a Kathy Mattea discard. Mary, I love you, but you can do better than this."
2,Mary Black has seen better days!,"I am a huge fan of Mary Black's earlier work. So, when I saw that she was releasing a new CD, I was thrilled. I couldn't wait to rip it open and pop it in. What a disappointment! I thought that Mary's voice sounded as if she were recovering from throat surgery or trauma. I am used to her voice being strong and vibrant, but this collection sees a definite movement away from that. If her records continue in this trend, I will be a fan of her earlier work only.Also, I was very disappointed that her band had also abandoned their traditional sounds. I feel I am being generous by rating this record 2 stars."
2,"Average Late 60's British ""Psych-Pop"", Not Much Frampton","While listening to this cd, the music sounds like a less talented version of ""Muswell Hillbillies"" era Kinks combined with ""Matchstick Men"" era Status Quo & ""Ogden Nut's"" era Small Faces. In other words, standard late 60's British pop with a tiny bit of psychedelia thrown in for good measure. Don't expect much (if any) singing or memorable guitar work from Frampton here. If his name wasn't on the cd cover, I might never know he was on the album just by listening to it. So my advice? If you're a huge Frampton fan, you have to buy this to complete your collection. If you enjoy late 60's and early 70's British pop-rock, check out the Kinks, or Small Faces first before you purchase this album."
3,Bette..one of THE troopers in the biz!,"i was at the taping of this show.bette began the first song andstopped in the middle of it. sheannounced she'd had a horriblecase of bronchitis for the priortwo months that was still withher. she then went off stage andbegan again and didnt stop onceafter that. the only giveawayis that she was nasal(more thanusual)and hoarseish. having seenbette countless times before thisshow i can attest to the factthat she had been better. not relating to her showmanship but tothe material, some of the songchoices and pacing. indeed thebest of bette in concert was captured before and audience in cleveland. this show captures the truest bette. her absolutelyraw talent emanating from herlike sunrays. frankly, i preferher vicki edie(lounger singer) character from which delores delago, the wheelchaired mermaidwas born. this first show is outthere on vhs. very hard to find.hopefully one day it will be rereleased so all can revel in hertalent. she really had no peerback then."
4,"""Eggs Will Be Laid Tonight""","Too bad that Her Majesty is no longer this politically incorrect. She doesn't belt tunes like this anymore either, so I can recommend this to all who have never seen her early career. The quality of the video is mediocre, but the sound quality is above average. Check out those coconuts!"
5,the soundtrack makes this movie,"the soundtrack is captivating---no other western with the exception of the searchers-john waynes finest film-comes close--i watch it for the soundtrack and garners performance-and all the other fine actors--the soundtrack makes this movie---without it, it would be forgotten"
3,Pretty good western.,"Gritty performance by Garner, not the affable character he is so often associated, along with an interesting story line makes this a very watchable film. Dennis Weaver gives a good performance as the conflicted frontier business man whose wife had been abducted by the indians. The Sidney Poitier character is not well developed though he looks dashing in his western garb. The Neil Hefti score takes a while to get used to but is familiar enough not to be too distracting. The indians are protrayed with some degree of social consciousness, though violent in their treatment of captives, which may very well be accurate. And the attitude of many of the white folk toward the indians is certainly not what you might call charitable. An engrossing film, but not one that is designed to put a smile on your face when it's over. Though there is a semblance of a hopeful ending, the cost in lives lost was is just too great for what is gained. And maybe that is the message."
4,Excellent Performance and Story,Great film revealing impact of socio-economic differences. How close so many are to homelessness. Williams gives a wonderful performance in this film.
1,Incredibly depressing,"I suppose this is probably a good film but it is very dark, visually and matephorically, and not entertaining at all. I would have had more fun watching animals getting euthanized probably - do not get this for entertainment value."
3,Decent product; misleading description,"This pouch works relatively well for the Samsung X496 phone. It is somewhat bulky, and the belt clip has a tendency to get pushed off the belt, though there is also a belt loop that would be more secure. My primary complaint about the pouch is that it is described as having a magnetic flap when it's actually a velcro flap. The flap does work well, but the description is nonetheless misleading."
2,Obsolete Product. No tech support,"The mouse doesn't fully function on any new OS. Windows 7 or Vista. If you call for tech support by the Kensingston, there is no response, yet they continue to sell a defective product. I really needed a working 5 button mouse, only two of the buttons work. I would be wary of any new Kensingston products in general now."
4,Good product,I purchased this mouse as a replacement for the one my wife uses on her computer. It is the same mouse that I use and I really like the features on the mouse. Since I am on a Mac computer it is sometimes hard to find a good mouse that works well with a mac. Kensington continues to support the mac and make a great product.
2,keep hitting the side buttons,I was looking for a 5 button mouse to replace my old one. Its fine as a mouse but the 2 buttons on either side are way too easy to hit accidentally. If you cup the mouse sort of like you are holding a baseball you wont hit those buttons but who uses a mouse like that? Most folks sort of reach for the mouse and put their hand on top of the mouse and that's where you start hitting the side buttons. My old mouse put the buttons closer to the front.
3,All most a great mouse,I prefer Kensington Products for my Mac's but this mouse causes me some pause.It works well but not as slick as all my many other Kensington products. The softwareseems to be the biggest issue so far. It's old software that comes with this mouse.Go to the Kensington downloads to get the updated software then the mouse is fine.This mouse works better than the standard mouse that comes with a Mac.Will I buy kensington again? Sure I will!! Their service and warranty make all thedifference to me.
3,Kensington Optical Eliet USB Mouse,"Mouse works, but software is outdated for the Mac, so you can't utilize all of the functionality that the mouse should preform."
4,Review of Kensington 72121 Mouse,"I like the product...scrolling wheel squeaks a little...cord contains lead (?!)...still, it does what it's supposed to do. Kensington makes reliable equipment."
3,A Good Book,I liked the book because there was a lot of action but some of it was hard to believe. Gary Paulsen did a good job of describing it. I liked the book Hatchet better because there was a real plane crash and in The River there was no plane crash; they just got dropped off. In Hatchet he had a hatchet and the hatchet was a cool thing.
3,Da Riva,This book is about I kid his name was Brian. He was known as the kid who survived in the wilderness and these people from the survival company wants him to show them his ways and to it agian but he will have help from a man named derrick. They go to the river and Derrick got struck by lighting and went into a coma. So Brian took him to a nearbye station and wooohooo.
2,An okay book to read,"I guess the book was o.k. It wasnt a book I would suggest someone to read. I didnt read it because it looked interesting, it was just something to read since i read the hatchet. For some reason i knew something was gonna happen because the beginning of the story was boring. The trip was gonna turned bad some how. There wasnt any action in it. I dont know i guess it was a good book."
4,Exciting and Thrilling,Once again Gary Paulsen writes another thrilling and exciting wilderness adventure. The River is about Brian and Derek. Brian and Derek get dropped off in the wilderness by a plane so Brian can teach Derek how to survive in the wilderness. Than Derek is struck by lightning and it is up to Brian to bring them both to safety.Brian has to paddle the boat 100 miles up river in order to do this. I recommend you read this book if you enjoy thrilling adventurous books.
3,The River,"The river is about a boy named Brian Robeson. He is 15 years old. He survived in the wilderness for 54. All he had was a Hatchet. Psychologist, Derek Holtzer asks him to stay in the wilderness again except he would go with him. They fly out in a plane to Necktie Lake. When they're there Derek gets struck by lighting and is in coma. Brian has to bring Derek back to the trading post. What will happen next? Read the book to find out!"
4,The River,"""The River"" is about this boy named Brian Robeson, and how the government wants him to go back into the wilderness so that the military and astronauts can study how Brian survived in the wilderness alone. This time he won't be alone,a psychologist named Derek Holtzer will be with him. If you want to find out more about what happens to Derek and Brian, read the book ""The River."" I thought the book was okay. It had its good points and bad points. I guess I would recommend this book, of course to a fifth grader."
4,Pretty Good Book,"This is a pretty good sequel to hatchet, I read it in middle school, overall, yes I liked it and would recommend it."
5,The second book of Hatchet!,"The book The River is basically the second book of Hatchet. 15 year old Brian Robeson was convinced by Derek to teach him how to teach other people to survive in the wild. After Brian gets convinced he has to relive his experience in the wild. If you want to find out what he does and how he survives read this book. (By Emil, 11 y/o)"
2,The River was O.K.,"Adam, David, Steven and Tim did not care that much for The River because it was no as exciting as Hatchet. Brian was not as succesful, and he did not discover how to do as many things as he did in Hatchet. He already knew how to do a lot of thngs when he went on the river."
3,Fantastic,"Phil, Matt and Brandon thought The River was fantastic because it was non-stop action. Brian was not alone in The River."
4,The River-Fred,"The author is Gary Paulsen.The book was published in 1991.I would give it arating of four out of five.The two main charactors are Brian and DerekDerek comes to Brians door and asks him to go to the wilderness again just likehe did in the Hatchet and live with just some back up gear.Brian doesen't thinkanything can go wrong.But when Brian and Derek got to the forest Brian toldDerek not to bring the extra gear exept a radio.But when the storm comes Derekgets struck by lightning ,and goes into a coma.Brian knows he has to do somthingabout it even though he wants to go home and eat hot food and sleep in a nice warmbed.He does go home after he takes care of Derek.The moral of the story is : alwaysbe prepared.He learns that he should always expect the unexpected At the end of thestory Brian has become more experienced in life.I liked the book because you arealways wondering and theres always adventure you dont know whats going to happennext."
3,Annie's Reveiw For The River By: Gary Paulsen,"I loved this book. I felt like it had so much personality and adventure. It's about this boy called Brian who survived 54 days in the Canadian wilderness with nothing but a hatchet. One day is man Derek Holtzer, a psychologist comes to his house and asks him to relive his experience. At first Brian is hesitant but decides to go. Derek and Brian take a plane ride to Necktie River in the Canadian wilderness where Brian got stuck before. One night mysteriously hit by ligtning and put into a coma. Brian must find a way to save his dear friend's life before it is too late. I think kids all over the world will love this book. It is so compelling there are tons of cliffhangers too. You won't believe what happens at the end."
4,The review of The River,I liked The River because it was a very good book and you could never tell what was going to happen next.It started by Brian answering the door.Two big guys were trying to get Brian to go back on the island and show Derek how he survived.Derek was a psychologist.The book gets much better where they're on the plane.A week later Derek get struck by lightning because he happens to touch the radio while he is sleeping.If you want to know the rest you're going to have to get the book yourself.Plus if you already have read the book Hatchet your going to love The River.
3,Brian's review of The River,Brian Robeson was in the Canadian forest for 54 days with nothing but a hatchet. When he returned Brian was famous but did not like being famous. One evening a man named Derek Holtzer came to Brians house and asked if he would do it again to teach Derek how he survived. Derek was a psychologist who would teach other people how to survive in the wlderness. When they arrived at the lake they would be staying at Brian would not allow anything but the radio an the briefcase. One stormy night Derek gets struck by lightning and Brian builds a raft to bring Derek down the river to get help. I liked this book and would recomend it to everyone.
5,Great,Classic story of survival Brian is at his greatest when paddling down the river the government should have sent someone else
5,It sends me...,"This cd is close to sacred. It is almost too personal to review. If I were to listen to Pulling Back the Reins, Trail of Broken Hearts and anything from Ingenue, in succession, I may fall to pieces. Only purchase this cd if you are capable of the emotions that ensue."
2,Whew. BOR-ing.,"Sorry to disagree, but I do. This story chugs along very predictably, and I had a hard time caring about the protagonist -- I wanted her to get a life, and it took her a long time just to find a man. Skip it. Read ""The Cape Ann"" (Faith Sullivan) instead. Or maybe the phone book."
3,Compare his essays with Cahill and O'Rourke,"Pico Iyer has a poetic style, Tim Cahill is compassionate, and P.J. O'Rourke is down and dirty. But all three have written excellent travel essays, sometimes on the same places. My recommendation is to read ""Falling Off the Map"", and Iyer's earlier book, ""Video Night in Kathmandu"", and then read ""Holidays in Hell"" by O'Rourke and any book by Cahill for other takes on the same turf. Overall, you'll get a very well-rounded picture of some lands that you might never want to visit, but which are fascinating in their own, dysfunctional, way."
5,A true gem.,"If you like Astor Piazzolla, you'll love this one. This, along with Buenos Aires Tango: Zero Hour and La Camorra, are Piazzolla's best works (even recognized by the master himself).If you like tango, you'll love this one. No matter how purist you could be, Milonga Picaresque es as pure as tango itself.If you like Jazz, you can't miss Milonga For Three (Reprise).And, if you just like music (like me) well, this is the CD to have.It has something that makes it so special. It's great for all tastes. One funny thing: Milonga For Three (reprise) is GREAT FOR LOVEMAKING ;-)"
4,crazy stuppid fun,"The songs on this was played in allot of clubs back in the 90""s. Was also fetured in NYC undercover episode. I was just staring to go the Clubs, and they pump I go my education, and I'm beatuiful dammit. I recalling hearing the songs, and thinking how stupid, but end up hearing it so much end up loving it. Now we have new stupid dance songs like 'Call me maybe' .....lol funny"
1,Get Szell's version instead!,"First of all, let me get one thing straight, I don't believe in authenticity when it comes to how a work of music should be played. I don't mind if they're just trying to recreate how it would've been played during Beethoven's time, but must Roger Norrington say that it HAS to be played this way to be appreciated? I just don't understand. This recording is too ugly to be joyful. Where the tempo should be slow, it's fast, and vice versa. Beethoven would probably turn in his grave if he heard this vulgar performance.IMHO, the one I would go with is by George Szell, Robert Shaw, and the Cleveland Orchestra and Chorus. It may not be on period instruments, but it blows away this recording. Norrington is no match for Szell's mastery of the orchestra and Shaw's great choral direction. Just listen, and you'll see why."
1,Bad Editing ruins a book,"I picked this up hoping for a light mystery and found my enjoyment ruined by the misuse of a few words. Another case where trusting a computer spell checker just isn't safe-- have a friend read the last draft or get a better editor! The funniest? She never expected to benefit from her Uncle's 'largest'. (that's largesse) Other than a couple of spectacular malaprop's, this book was a decent mystery. Were the travel tips accurate? Someday I hope to find out!"
3,decent,"Not as good as Glue but a worthy effort. It's hard to hear what Adeem is saying; the beats stand out more than the lyricist here. I would recommend this for the die-hard fans who want everything Adeem is on. Otherwise, cop Glue's Sunset Lodge and Adeem & Shalem's Transitions. Adeem's going nowhere but up from here, Glue's 2006 release will no doubt be even nicer than these records. You can get Adeem and Glue's stuff for cheap at Shakeitrecords.com, visit their site too (Ramonarecords.com).C IV"
2,cheap and good for light droolers,"Price is cheap, but the bibs are quite thin. Not good for juices or water since there are no plastic backings. Since it is terry cloth quality, it is hard to wipe away food spilled on them. But good for the light droolers. Good size... not too small."
5,Great deal,"This product is not only has great quality at a great price, i have laundered them once so far and they look wonderful. Highly recommended."
3,ok bibs,I ordered 2 sets of the 10 bibs. They are ok. My twins drool a lot. the drool seems to go right through. They are not as thin as other bibs ive seen but they do eventually seep through.
2,Not for programmers,"This book could be good for Electrical Engineers or Physicists interested in the field, but I really would not recommend it to researchers with background in Computer Science. The notations and everything are makes reading and following naturally harder for us."
5,BHG Pies and Cakes,This is exactly what I was looking for and it came proptly and just as advertised. THANKS
1,Two-thumbs Down,"I purchased this book with the hope that it would provide me with greater insight into using my SB-28. Ha. I don't think that I have ever come across a more confusing, ill-conceived book. It's enough to make one want to go back to flashcubes.The book is poorly organized--headings and topics pile on top of one another without purpose or reason--at least none that I can discern. The explanations often leave one hanging, longing for more detail or at least greater clarity. Frustrating? Let me tell you. I would definitely NOT recommend this book. I only give it one star because zero stars isn't an option."
1,Superficial and Confusing,"This Magic Lantern Guide is a genuine disappointment. I am an advanced amateur with 20 years of Nikon and Hasselblad experience. Usually, the Magic Lantern series lucidly fortifies your owner's manual. Not so, here. The Sb-28 Speedlight is a sophisticated device, reasonably well documented in its owner's manual. But, I craved a more thorough review of foreground and bacground exposure options. Most particularly, I hoped for a cogent explanation of using the Sb-28's exposure compensation controls in tandem with my F-100's custom setting, exposure compensation, and bracketing functions. This type of important and detailed discussion is missing from this book. Overall, the writing is confusing and awkward. The author spends too much time on the general basics of flash photogrphy and fails to focus on how to use the Sb-28."
1,Not much more than the SB-28 owners manual,"I was disappointed in this book, I only covers a bit more than the owners manual which is fairly clear. In many cases the author discribes the function of the speedlight but does not give examples of why you would want to use this function. Little is devoted to flash set up and planning of the shot. I would not bother with this book."
4,COULD IT BE?,"OK, SO I WAS LIVING IN LA IN 1990 AND WORKING AT TOWER RECORDS IN TORRENCE. MY FRIEND LIZ INTRODUCED ME TO SOME FRIENDS WHO HAD A GROUP CALLED HARLOW. I GOT A TAPE FROM THE LEAD SINGER AND LOVED IT. THE SONG ""CHAIN REACTION"" WAS FREAKIN AWESOME.. I LOST THE TAPE AND HAD NEVER SEEN OR HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT THEM SINCE UNTIL NOW! MAN, I HOPE THIS IS IT! I AM IN HEAVEN. AWESOME GROUP, AND SOME DAMN GOOD VOCALS!!!"
3,"Good, but plenty of other books are more helpful","This book is a good general start for studying children's history. I would have to say that it doesn't really seem to present anything new to the field. There are definitely a lot of other great books on children's history, and the discipline is growing. One site I found (childhistory.org) has a pretty good list of a variety of books that deal with the history of children and childhood, all of which are linked here to Amazon. Anyway, I look forward to more scholarly interest in something so fundamental to our lives as childhood."
5,one of my favorites ever,"This movie combines so many different emotions, and sets up a dreamworld and story for you to fall in love with. But if you're thinking of buying it, you've probably already seen it. The only reason to buy this DVD is if you want to see it over and over again, and if you want see the added features...which are interesting once. As far as the movie goes, I can do nothing but give it 5 stars."
3,This Movie,"Heard good things about this movie, waiting for the download to finish so i can watch the entire film, also this film was nominated for like 7 academy awards"
2,"BEWARE ""anamorphic"" pseudo-widescreen (FAKE)","""Anamorphic"" widescreen? When is a widescreen movie not a widescreen movie? When it's anamorphic, which is a phony, useless imitation of genuine widescreen. If I had realized the phony nature of this print of OoA, I never would have purchased it.The Song of Africa documentary was OK, though.DON'T BUY this DVD if you're looking for an image like the one you saw in the theater. You will be as disappointed as I am, which is REALLY disappointed."
4,Out of Africa,Excellent value. The price of AMAZON dvds is very reasonable. Picture quality of the dvd was very good. Sound quality also good. No skips or misses in playback.
5,Out of Africa Review,"This is a movie about a woman named Karen Blixen (played by Meryl Streep who is wonderful) who is married to a man who is a womanizer. They are from Denmark, and he married her for her money, and she married him for his title. She was in love with his brother. Together they bought a plantation in Kenya, and begin to raise coffee, which had never been done there before. He is never home, always off hunting, and she falls in love with the land and its people. She is a very strong woman, and eventually falls in love with another man (Robert Redford). The scenic value of this movie is out of this world, it is breathtakingly beautiful. The acting is good, Meryl Streep & Robert Redford, what else would you expect. No nudity, no language, but I don't think kids would stick with it, it's too long. It's not an 'exciting' movie, per se, it's a long romantic drama. Oh, and did I mention it is a true story."
5,Still the best film ever,This is still one of the best films ever.Any film where the images can stick in your mind over time has to be great.
2,Disappointing Blu Ray transfer,"This review is entirely about the Blu ray versionThe transfer is absolutely shamefulPart of the grandeur of the landscape was lost, and there were close ups which looked amateurish and artificialAnd the Universal fiddly menu screens and extremely slow start upIf you want to this kind of fake Blu ray disc, don't bother . It's an insult to the movie and the paying customersShame on Universal, its a sacrilege !"
3,See Selma's younger hot body,"Selma is a bit older now and plays more mature roles. This movie is one of her earlier movies, so you get to see her as a hot young fox. This is a very nice date movie.Bad points: The first 15 minutes is a little boreing."
1,celtic thunder,I really enjoy the group Celtic Thunder on the PBS channel so I came to amazon to order thier music and DVD. Along with my order of the correct group I order this music also. They are a big let down. Amazon needs to let customers know this is a different group. The music and sing was not as enjoyable as the other ones.
4,Celtic Thunder,I thought this was by the new group Celtic Thunder but still enjoy all the songs and singers
5,"truly significant, and still relevant","Man, we wore this album out more than once when I was in college back in the 80s. Blondie WAS the 80s, and everyone else were mere followers. Don't believe me? Back in the 70s, when everyone else was busy making the worst music ever, Blondie was living in vans and run-down apartments, already playing their 80s music in the streets and nightclubs to whoever would listen. They were literally years ahead of their time.I can't believe I went so long without a copy of ""Parallel Lines"", but I'm glad they're back in my life."
4,Good value for the price,"This is a very good rendition at a fair price. However, the narration is very soft, and when you turn it up so that it can be heard clearly, the music blasts you off your seat."
4,an easy-to-read intro to Transcendental Meditation,"This is the first book about Transcendental Meditation (TM) that is simple, direct and a quick read. It doesnt tell you HOW to meditate (that is available only through a private, one-one-one instruction with a trained TM teacher) but it DOES answer alot of questions about what TM is (and isn't) and give examples what TM has done to improve the lives of many people around the globe."
1,A remarkable example of marketing drivel,"Targeting excitable housewives and undereducated middle-managers, this entire book consists of a business case to enroll in one of Mahesh Yogi's schools.I do not dispute merits of his technique - how could I, if there is not a single word about it in the book?! Thank Zeus I've got this book from the library - I've seen more exciting writing coming out of the Federal Government's accounting departments. One should be paid to read this."
3,Great selection,"At first glance the book was disappointing and daunting primarily because the recipes are in paragraph format without a list of ingredients; however, after sitting down with the book I found it to be authentic and very easy to use. The selections are immense and covered the gamut of Polish cuisine. I would recommend this book highly."
4,engaging read,"the director's eye is an appropriate title for a directing book that explores varied ways of seeing, looking, and translating for the stage. ahart's text is a lively introduction for the novice director while also serving as a refreshing reminder for experienced directors. the assignments nicely support the seven part organizational structure of the book. ahart does not claim to have answers but enthusiastically points the reader toward a lively ""vision"" of what it means and the joy as well as work involved in taking on the role of director."
3,A lot about pugs,"This is a very useful and complete handbook (there is even a Perpetual Whelping Chart ) . Every chapter is divided into short meaningful paragraphs each with an evident title wich makes the book easy to consult. The text includes too a short history of the pug , informations about pugs in art and literature and the directions how to show a pug and to compete in obedience. It's a pity that photos are a bit out of date."
1,Gateway Hater,"I purchased my new Gateway laptop and since I had not heard anything bad about the company, expected to have a satisfactory product. My main complaint is the exceptionally slow time it takes to install a program. The install goes along at a reasonable time frame copying the program to my hard drive from CD. But at the final install step which it states will take two minutes, instead goes on and on for hours. That was my spyware program. A few days later, I tried to install programs which came with the computer and again, two hours later when I tried to stop the install, a message came up that 'program xxx is still installing, do you want to quit?' I responded 'no' and the install contined for another two hours. I finally stopped it and have not bothered to install any other programs. My advice? Do not buy a Gateway."
4,Great sounding band with another solid effort !!!!!!,"Do not listen to reviews that tell you that they don't sound like Nickelback, because they do. What is wrong with that. Nickelback is a great band and TOAD are on their way. It is nice to hear a band that incorporates great writing with great songs. These guys can sing and play. The standout song on the album is Santa Monica. (Not a cover of the old Everclear song) Hopefully they will release this song as a single. I hope more people warm up to this kind of music so that this band has a chance of making it beyond 3 albums, which seems to be a barrier for most rock bands playing today. Good luck guys and keep rocking. Since the new Nickelback album does not come out till the fall, thank you for an appetizer for the summer. Hope to see you on the road."
3,I want to like it...,"...and I do like it - to a certain point. I'm not head-over-heels in love with it, but I don't think it's complete garbage, either. And I'm not going to bash them and call them Nickelback rip off artists, although at times I swear they sound just like them. I will say TOADs lyrics are definitely stronger than Nickelback's (but that might not being saying too much - and yes, I do like (not love) Nickelback).That said, I do enjoy listening to Hating Hollywood, Santa Monica, Say Goodbye, and Since You Been Gone."
4,"Stylish, Comfortable & Functional","I use this bag every day on my bike commute. I ditched my messenger bag because I was getting a sore shoulder and wanted a real backpack. It's got a lot of nice corduroy-lined internal pockets to keep everything organized and great padding on the straps and back. I like the one-sided zips that are easy to access with one strap off, but the center zip pocket (obstensibly for sunglasses) is almost impossible to get to without taking the bag off completely. I would have also preferred a chest strap for increased comfort, but it's still pretty nice without it."
1,Terrible,"Look, I like watching untalented people make fools of themselves as much as the rest of America, but between the schmaltzy ""aw shucks, rural America is adorable"" condescending tone and the technical problems (a lot of it is hard to hear and the DVD is not formatted for television so the edges are cropped, which makes the titles unreadable) this is not worth the watch. The worst part is the narrator - there's something creepy about a midddle aged woman giggling constantly and trying to act adorable. The only good thing is the terrible technical manager of the theatre who is right out of a Chris Guest movie, and the cameo by a creepy old Fabian. Not worth your money or your time. And I actually think most of the people in these towns should be offended."
1,Malita 10 cup percolator,"Bought first melitta 10 cup, after a short period of time didnot make coffee anymore, just warm off colored water. Bought a second one ,after a few months same thing ,does not perc long enough to make a cup of hot coffee. Very disappointed with this product it was the only one that was just the right size too bad they don't work very well."
2,"Ok, but not great","I would not recommend this book to non-Greeks or people who are not familiar with Greek cooking (like myself). Some of the recipes seem to leave out important information - like how to prepare the vegetables before cooking - which might be obvious to a more experienced Greek cook. Also, some of the recipes are good and others a sort of blah. Although maybe this is because it is hard to get really fresh produce year round in the NE US - unlike in Greece. I do like how the book is organized into menus."
3,Important attention for customers,"Just to mention that there is another box set from Brilliant classics; that is in white; same label; less cds, part of this more complete edition ! Don't be confused : The red box set is the same as the white one with more cds; artists added : make a choice and buy one or another with different charges; relative prices ! Happy hollidays, music lovers !Chopin Edition: Complete Works (17 CD Box Set)"
4,"Great title, great songs.","I'm sure alot of people came to know ""Julee Cruise"" from the music of ""Twin Peaks"". If your a fan of that soundtrack, this is more of the same. In fact, three songs here are on that soundtrack. The music is very much how others have desribed it, ""haunting"", ""mysterious"", etc., and it has a light jazz feeling to it, without really being jazz at all. You could snap your fingers in a few spots though. Overall a very moody album, and while it's all good, some of the songs are absolutely beautiful, like ""Nightingale"", and ""Falling"". Her album ""The Voice Of Love"" is just as good too. Any of the above mentioned cd's will have you ""Floating Into the Night""."
5,great,Great PPV and a better PPV then anything WWF/WWE ever had or will have. WW3 was the best match type ever in wrestling.
1,Not Happy,I got this model because it was cheaper than the foodsaver models and it was cheaper for a reason. I could not get the lid to lock intoplace hence the machine would not work. I even got my husband and son to try with no success. I sent it back and got the FoodSaver V2240when it went on sale at a local retailer and now I am happy. Stay away from the cheaper imitations.
1,Doesn't Last! Don't Buy This,"You get what you pay for. It took me two purchases to figure out these dont last. Both we purchased did not last 6 months and maybe 5-6 uses. The unit will lose the step up on the vaccum motor to 'hand free' mode. Then it will not go to seal. If you need one for 3-4 uses then want to throw it in the trash, this this is the unit for you. Buyer Beware!!!!"
2,Autoamerican doesn't make it for me.,"Sorry, I can't agree with the other reviews. For a group that pioneered hard-driving rock in the late 70's, this wild mix of eclecticism doesn't cut it for me. If I want to hear Big Band I'll listen to Benny Goodman. How can ""Rapture"" be heralded as the vanguard of rap, when most of rap is politically aware, but the lyrics of ""Rapture"" are totally inane? To me, it's a noble experiment, but a failed one.Sorry, I love Blondie, and ""Eat to the Beat"" is one of my top 5 albums ever, but they died here."
3,Reissue of Autoamerican,"I ordered this album to get two tracks hard or impossible to find from other sources--the sound quality on this reissue is outstanding but I just wanted those two tracks. The liner notes were also informative but for my purposes, unnecessary."
1,innaccurate measurements,This looks like a good book...HOWEVER - unlike other reviews I have attempted to make one of the quilts in the book (the Whirligig Quilt). I have just started quilting and wanted to try this pinwheel style of block. Well the other reviewers are correct in saying the instructions are clear BUT THE MEASUREMENTS ARE INACCURATE!! So now I have three different sizes and none of them make a whirligig pattern. In addition I have been unable to find any corrections by the editor/publisher anywhere on the web...am I the only person in the world who has tried the pattern from this book?Do not buy this book
5,Quite possibly the greatest live recording of the eighties.,"This album maybe the greatest live recording of the eighties. No, it may not have the cleanest, or most technically perfect sound of any live CD, however, it offers something that no live CD (that I've heard) has: Feel. This is a CD that will make you feel as if you were there. You can here the little nuances that make a live show of this magnitude so great. A triumph. I only wish I were there to see it."
1,Horrible live recording,"Back in the 80's I was quite the collector of DM 12"" singles and eps, particularly UK imports. I've seen them live and enjoyed it very much. HOWEVER - having given this another listen I am disappointed to realize this is a very poor album. The songs themselves stick too close to the studio recordings. I remember the band utilizing custom crafted percussion instruments to great effect, but really, most of the music is merely pre-recorded tapes. I felt pity for Dave Gahan as he goaded the audience to respond with his near constant yelps and barks. I hated it. Unfortunately, a canned effort is what you're going to get each and every hellish night you have to sing these songs OVER and OVER and OVER again, NIGHT after NIGHT after NIGHT. I feel sorry for them during this stage of their career. Having to perform these every night for years should drive a sane person MAD."
3,Rockabilly at its best!,I saw the Road Kings once and was an instant fan. This is a great band and an awesome CD!
2,Questionable,"I purchased this cd because of the number of great Ray Stevens Songs that I had listened to growing up. When I got the discs, I opened it up only to find that these were not the original recordings. They were more recent recordings, some without the same lyrics. The most disappointing were two of my all time favorites; ""The Haircut Song"" and ""Ballad of the Blue Cyclone."" If you are a Ray Stevens fan, don't bother with the box set. I recommend buying the original albums for original, classic Ray Stevens."
2,Not good...,"This product was difficult to use initially, and stopped working after a few months. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Finished The Tutorial? Pass on the Book,"I suppose if one were too lazy to complete the tutorial, this book would be viewed as a welcome tool. For anything other than the rank newbie - it's not. There are tidbits of good information, but for the most part the book repeats iself in many issues. The humor while sophmoric, does not lend itself to the books readability. I won't even start on the CD - read the other posts for that....."
1,Stupid little book...,Can't really comment on the content too much as it is very difficult to read this teeny-tiny tome. I mistakenly ordered it thinking it was a regular size book - my mistake I know. The whole lay out is just off putting.
3,The 8th Habit,"Covey is not telling anything new in this little book. Everything written here is an abstract from his "" 7 Habit..."" book. Covey has shown the chart on page 68-69 on Whole person, Needs, Intelligence Capacities, Attributes and Voice is fully written in ""7 Habits.."" book also which was written twenty some years ago. I personally think I wasted my money in purchasing this book."
2,Promotional CD - Not for Resale!,"This 36 minute CD should not be sold on Amazon. It is clearly stamped on the front, ""SALE IS PROHIBITED."" Besides, if anyone expects samples of wedding music, they will be disappointed. This ain't the Chieftains!"
4,Skins Antenna Helmet,"Tends to look good, there's an occasional tilt of the helmet staying straight on the head. Make sure to remove ornament during storms/ will fall off in strong winds. No regrets buying this product"
4,Great MLPS Design and Very Well Remastered Sound!,"This is by far the best version of this album that's out there. Not only is the mlps gatefold sleeve design outstanding, the remastered sound is fantastic. A much more cohesive-sounding album as compared with ""Let it Bleed"", the Stones continues to go to the same well with old style slide guitar type blues mixed with Led Zeppelin-like folk tunes and the occasional rock thrown in for good measure. Recommended."
4,Beggar's Banquet is a Feast!,"This is a ""must have"" release mainly because it includes, ""Sympathy for the Devil"" and ""Street Fighting Man."" It also marks the Stones' first serious venture into Southern R&B and blues written by them."
2,Overrated,"""Begger's Banquet"" has been touted as a classic album and in some respects, it is. Despite all this hype, I still find BB to be a lacking if not flat album.In my mind, the best song on this album is ""Street Fighting Man."" Even though this song is a bit dated, it still can get your energy level up. It rocks! ""Sympathy for the Devil"" has been played so many times on rock radio stations over the past few decades, it's no longer worth listening to.""Stray Cat Blues"" isn't too bad but after you hear the live version of this song on ""Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out,"" you won't like the studio version nearly as much. The rest of the material on this album is low-grade and forgettable."
2,Overrated,This was supposed to be one of the best Stones albums. Sucks. If you love the stones you'll probably like it though. I'm shocked at how bad of a singer Mick is. I did like Sticky Fingers.
4,"it's cheap, adequate replacement","battery life/health: out of the box, istat pro reads the battery at around 90% health. on a full charge, istat pro projects a ~3 hr battery life.fit: not perfect but my 12"" powerbook is sooo old i dont really care and for less than $30, i'll deal. the casing is plastic so the color isnt a perfect match either but it's neglegable.bottom line: if youre not picky, get it. it'll do the job for a great price."
4,"Basic, not ""complete""","This is a basic dictionary of geography, but in no way shape or form is it a ""complete"" dictionary. It has place names and geographic concepts suitable for anyone at any age, not dumbed down but very accessible. But as far as advanced concepts for the college or graduate level, you're better off looking elsewhere. See Blackwell's Dictionaries of Human and Physical Geography.If your kid is taking geography, or if you are teaching K-12 geography (as I did) this book will help in providing well-articulated basic definitions to build on."
3,Stiletto,"Cesare Cardinale is a rich businessman and race driver who also works as a hitman for the Mafia, because he enjoys killing. But after killing four would-be-witnesses, the Mafia bosses are afraid he might talk, so they want him dead.The plot is a standard hitman story without any surprises. The focus is more on Cesare's romantic affairs than on the actual Mafia/hitman story. The book also spends quite long parts on background stories on the two female characters. ""Stiletto"" is a quick read, but not very interesting."
1,Poorly Made,"I was very disappointed with the quality of these socket storage strips. The inserts didn't fit the socket recesses, and I had to squeeze each one with a pair of pliers to get them to enter the sockets. This was the case with both the 3/8"" and the 1/4"" sizes. Just another case of a trusted company settling for ""Chinese Junk"" to increase profit."
3,I have seen the PPV and I was mad,"Dear Who ever reads this , I saw Starcadde 1998 IT MADE ME MAD WHEN GOLDBERG Got defeated by Big Sexxy .Now I will get the video because it is a night where Goldberg got defeated. Thanks Logan Goldberg fan"
1,Horrible show.,"If you're looking to buy someone a gift, trust a reviewer of wrestling shows and don't buy this one. There are only two good matches on the entire program, and they're the first two ones. Just pass on this one. Terrible show."
2,flat,"Other than a couple of good songs and one GREAT one(Love Shack), the CD doesnt hold alot of interest, and I think in general, isnt a keeper."
5,B-52's for the masses,"As someone that loved them LONG before ANYONE knew who they were, I can honestly say that it was exciting to see the B-52's become a household name.As far as ""Cosmic Thing"", it's a great CD, but I can't imagine that it's the favorite of old B-52's fans like myself. It's the B-52's, cleaned up and polished for mass consumption. I have no problem with this, just as long as they don't make a habit of it.The best track on the CD, by far, is ""Channel Z"". It has all the energy they are famous for, ""Bush Fire"" is also a great tune with more of the B-52's classic style.If nothing, this CD proves that I must have differing tastes from most people, because ""Love Shack"" is just an OK song, certainly not the one I would have picked to be as big as it's been."
5,Boxing,Excellent footage and great interviews...a must have for Muhammad Ali fans or boxing fans in general..
3,A poor engineered software,"Ulead's products are easy to use with a pretty good workflow design. However, poor engineered with lots glitches. The products all require high cpu and memory usage and frequently lock up.Recommend it but do not go close to the limit."
4,room for improvement,"Although it is a great book of illistration for the beginner, there are illistrations that are not clear. Most of them you can find clarity in the written explanation, however there are illistrations that have two right hands. That is something that I would think should have been caught in editing, not to mention the artist who drew up the illistration. A little dissappointing, but a good book."
5,Great,Love the book. Very clear instructions and drawings. I look forward to learning sign language. It was a great gift to receive.
2,Not what i expected,"I did not enjoy this DVD much, i expected something like 'Running the Sahara' but it was much less interesting.The idea of running the Pacific Coast Trail is a good one but it was not documented well in this movie. The narrators voice made it even more boring."
3,Not Bad,"I really only like a couple songs on this album. That is the way it always is with these Casual Gods rekkids. I only liked two off the last one. This one I like Sleep Angel and the track following it.The rest? It's mediocre early 90's high brow rock. Jerry Harrison lays his very 1990's environmental message on pretty dang thick. He hits the listener over the head rather than be subtle about it. But the cover art with a man in an orange enviornmental suit ""walking on water"" or rather walking on water so polluted that it can be walked on! Interesting. Too bad the rest of the album doesn't live up to the cover concept. Ciao!"
2,Not Clints Best by far!!!,"I watched this movie for the first time this past winter. How can anyone give this movie 5 stars. Its clearly not Clints best and was poorly shot with horrible dialog. The movie has a few memorable lines and scenes but 99% of this movie is aweful and does not live up to the reputation people give it. Im sure many of you will disagree with me and I dont care. This was not a good movie, not even close."
4,Dirty Harry (1971),"plot outline:When a madman dubbed the ""Scorpio Killer"" terrorizes San Francisco, hard-boiled cop Harry Callahan (Eastwood)-- famous for his take-no-prisoners approach to law enforcement-- is tasked with hunting down the psychopath.Harry eventually collars Scorpio in the process of rescuing a kidnap victim, only to see him walk on technicalities. Now, the maverick detective is determined to nail the maniac himself."
5,Footnote,"What can I possibly add to the volumes of praise that this classic has so richly earned over the years? Frankly, nothing. Just an ironic and probably meaningless footnote. If you ever get a chance to see Stallone's cartoonishly over-the-top Cobra from the mid-eighties, look for our favorite Scorpio killer, Andy Robinson, billed alongside Sly as ""Andrew Robinson"" playing an uptight cop who at one point, when the rogue Italian Stallion enforcer goes to smack him, whines loudly, ""He's the psycho!"""
2,Iconic but overrated,"I recently bought this DVD along with ""Bullit"" because I wanted to see if my recollections of these two very popular films were accurate. In the case of ""Bullit"", yes. This movie is actually better than I recall back when I was 17 in 1969. McQueen should have won an Oscar for that performance. ""Dirty Harry"" is inferior in every way: script, direction, sound, and acting. I had trouble staying with ""Dirty Harry"" what with all the 70s clichés that kept popping up to spoil it. But ""Bullit"" was fascinating from start to finish. Like James Dean, you have a hard time keeping your eyes off Steve McQueen, whether he is speaking or reacting. ""Dirty Harry"" is a very mediocre film that looks more like something made for TV, and it has not aged well. ""Bullit"" is the real deal and deserves the moniker of ""iconic"". Like a superb wine, it just keeps getting better."
3,Go ahead punk - read my review!!!,This is probably the best of the Dirty Harry films and Eastwood gives a memorable performance as Harry... a somewhat unorthodox policeman. it's not bad but it's hardly original is it?
3,Dirty Harry's gotten dirtier,"Worth it simply for Eastwood's iconic performance and Lalo Schifrin's soundtrack. Other political readings are no doubt possible but it's best to view this as an urban western, cathartic in its clear distinction between good and evil, the rule of law and crime. Dirty Harry's contempt for civil liberties seems tame by modern standards, almost quaint compared to events perpetrated by our government in recent years.Alas, the film itself has gotten dirtier over the years. Those who remember seeing the film in earlier video versions will be dissatisfied with this DVD release. As with a lot of films/tv shows from the 1970s which featured nighttime footage, the film has degraded so much that it is practically impossible to see what's going on in these scenes. The studios should take some pride in their catalogue and do the restoration that needs to be done."
3,Sunflower Fiestaware,So I purchased the Sunflower Fiestaware flatware and they are very cute. My problem was the run around I went through to get them.
4,Thoughtful for those searching for meaning in their lives.,Most people are searching for the meaning of their lives when it often does not appear to have meaning. The cases cited by Dr. Jarmon reveal the ultimate lessons of the soul's journey. This book not only reveals the soul of the patient but also the soul of the physician. Many of us do not have the privilege to see the soulful side of the healers who struggle to help their patients heal and to grow in spirit. It is time for medicine to recover and to reveal its soul.
1,Caveat Emptor - Let the Buyer Beware,"If you're considering purchasing this book, I recommend that you first borrow a copy to read. Be advised that Dr. Jarmon's license to practice psychiatry in the State of New Jersey was suspended in December 2001 for unprofessional conduct. Despite this, if you don't mind contributing to the royalties that the author is receiving from this publication, at least your decision to purchase it will be an informed one."
5,love it),"I absolutely love the thermal spa water! Anytime my skin is feeling dry or tight I just pull my thermal water out of my purse and spray it on my face. It works great right after a shower, when I step out of the shower my skin starts getting tight and dry but just a little spray of the thermal water refreshes the moisture in my skin and leaves my skin feeling hydrated. After learning about this product and about Vichy in general I've started recommending it to all my friends."
3,"Great Book, But Needs More Pictures","""The Complete Meat Cookbook"" has a wonderful amount of information on cuts, cooking techniques and so on which is great for a person like me who doesn't know much in the ways of meat. I also really like the little factoids at the top of the page that mentions if a certain recipe is: ""fast recipe"", ""great for leaftovers"", ""low-fat"", etc. What I didn't realize is that the book doesn't cover fish and chicken (which was a mistake on my part for not reading the cover carefully). Also, I wish this book had a picture for most to all of the recipes they feature in the book. I like seeing the end result before I buy all the ingredients. Hindsight 20/20 I don't think I would have bought this book and gone with something with a broader scope and more attention to detail."
5,I looooooooveee it!!!!!!,"Well I Love this thing. Yes it was somewhat hard to learn at first but if you pay close attention to the instructions manual it's pretty easy to operate. I am able easily navigate to my folders ect ect. I used window media player to save my favorite songs then went to my music and ""copied"" (not moved) the folders onto the player. For awhile I was confused at first about it. I had uploaded the folder that had the artist's name on it but you actually must open the artist's folder then copy the actual album's folder to the player otherwise it won't show up under folders. I hope this will help other people on this subject cause that had gotten me stumped for awhile. :) I must say it was totally worth the money!! I would buy it!! worth your money!!!"
1,I WAS BLOWN OUT OF MY CHAIR,"HA! Sister, this is owesome. I need to buy one as soon as possible. You sing just like your Dad. Please keep Uganda moving. We all love YA! He! put your chic closer. Iam sending my kisses. Kiss me too."
5,"Not quite like the ""Jim"" album, but it is a very good album","This is a very good album, Trust Afrigo to deliver. Listen to their superb Horn/Brass arrangements. I have had the honour of working with for quite some time."
2,Poor construction,"This comforter is beautiful and warm. For the first year we had no issues with it. After the first year, however, the batting inside began to slide to the edges and corners. The corners are particularly bad with very large clumps of batting in each of them. The clumps are probably 8 inches in diameter. It appears that either the batting is of poor quality or there is insufficient quilting to keep it in place. This is unfortunate because in all other regards it is a nice comforter."
3,Super cute but toe scuffs tooooo easily,"I bought these in blue and when they arrived, I immediately went back on Amazon and bought them in Silver. They are the cutest shoes ever BUT I wish I had waited to buy the other color. I never would have done it had I know what they would look like in one wear. The toes are painted and my daughter is very good on shoes but the paint came off the front of the shoes on both pairs in just one use. I am planning to buy metalic paint because they are just adorable and she loves them but I hate how they look! Use extreme caution!"
5,READ THIS BOOK!,"Memory is important, and its loss creates dangerous, violent, even evil conditions. This magnificent novel explores memory and its loss in contexts spanning the extremely personal, interpersonal, familial, metropolitan, architectural, mythic, philosophic, and religious. In a feat unsurpassed in virtuosity, Douglas Anthony Cooper has written a compelling, page-turning fictional memoir/mystery in a truly poetic voice."
1,Dont waste your time and money,"Worst printer available. Since day one I have struggled every time I use it. Wont load paper, grabs multiple pieces of paper at a time when it actually decides to work. Wont print any thing from the computer. If by chance it tries to print, it takes hours for a document to finish, if it finishes at all. Usually the printer quits mid way.Normally I like and use HP. This is an exception, biggest waste of money and piece of junk I've used in a long time."
1,One star for bad software installation,"So far, we haven't been able to install this printer's driver software on our Mac OS X 10.4 system. When we contacted HP Chat online support, they said they don't support Mac via online chat! They gave us an 800 number to call... so far, we haven't been able to determine the other qualities of this printer since we're stuck on the installation phase!This seems so typical of modern computer peripheral products these days. The installation software is DREADFUL -- it failed to complete on successive attempts."
1,I've had this for a couple years.,"I bought this printer a couple years ago. It was great until now. The photo quality all of a sudden deteriorated. The pictures look kinda hazy, I don't know how to describe it, but they aren't crisp pictures anymore. There are tiny red dots of ink on several places randomly on the pictures, like the cartridge is dripping or something. The printer is CONSTANTLY getting jammed. I'm very disappointed in the lifespan of this printer."
2,one to avoid,"slow printing, error prone printer , the printer insists that cyan needs to be refilled when there is a brand new hp cartridge installed and displays it as full---------in all fairness I don't know if the printer is garbage since it is installed on a machine running Vista"
2,Pretty but...,"I'm not one for words so I'll get to the point. I've had this for about a year and a half. If you're putting this in your room like I did be prepared to put Duct tape over the power switch. Unless you have kids that sleep with a nightlight, then you're set. The pictures are fantastic and print quick but, be prepared to replace ink frequently. It also has some kind of pre print function so when you print something be prepared to wait a minute or two and that's only if it doesn't paper jam. If that happens you have to turn the whole device around and open the back up. For me it's a pain since my desk set up is against a wall. Oh and this thing is a beast! Not for small desk spaces.Hope this helps."
4,Great Overall Printer - Photo Printing Outstanding,"I bought this printer after doing a bit of research and per Consumer Reports recommendation, and I have been very pleased with the print quality and features so far. Of exceptional note is the photo print quality. When using the HP Photo paper, the results are simply superior. You cannot tell that it was printed on an ink-jet and not from a professional photo print service. With that said, the HP software installation was a nightmare. I have a year old Dell XPS 400 running Windows XP and had to install the HP software three times before it would work properly. It was a frustrating, and to me, unnecessary experience. If HP can build such an outstanding printer, they should be able get the installation drivers right, especially since XP has been out for so long. If not for the software, I would have definitely given it a higher rating. So, 5 stars for printing (especially photos), 4 stars overall. Note to HP: Get the installation drivers right."
3,Great compositions but malmsteen out of tune,"""Yngwie Bach""When I first heard this record I thought many pieces came from old classic composers, really nice themework. I found out it was all composed by malmsteen, great! Not just a rework of old compositions, he really has the classic feel.""Yngwie monotoxical""But: the guitar playing is intermediate (compared to other Malmsteen work even bad), without expression. The guitar line doesn't add anything to the orchestra, instead of that it tends to dissonate a lot of times. The acoustic tracks are quite well.I have the feeling he was drunk while playing or there was too little time or no inspiration left when he had to do his guitar dubs.This record has two faces, compositions: 5 stars, guitar playing 1 star, making it three"
3,Less than what I expected,"As a long-time fan of neo-classical metal, I had high expectation for this disc. Unlike his other material, which tends to be rock/metal with overtones of classical themes and phrasing, CSfEGaO is classical music with an electric guitar added to the mix.Strangely, I though the guitar was relatively buried among the rest of the instruments. Clearly, this is a departure from his usual guitar-centered shredding. The compositions, as classical music goes, are average at best. I found that the guitar didn't really add that much. I've heard Malmsteen do better.Not recommended."
3,A good work,"It isn't a masterpiece, but is an interesting work for Yngwie's fans. I follow his works since 1990, and I say this one is a good thing.If you like mixes between different types of music you can buy it."
5,Black Sabbath is the band that rule the world of Heavy Metal,"Black Sabbath is a great band. There best Cd for me is We Sold Our Sole For Rock'N'Roll. Its the best Cd I've heard. I am gutiarest and Black Sabbath Gutiarest ""Toni""is the best Power Codes player for me. Any one who like Heavy Metal should try this CD By Yousaf"
4,It is hard to follow the first 3!,"I remember when Sabbath released their first album. It was competing with Grand Funk Railroad for my friends attention. To me it was no contest and I embraced Black Sabbath into my life's soundtrack. By the time 4 came out, they began polishing their sound. I guess we all get attached to the initial sound that impacts us, whether it was Steppenwolf, Hendrix, the Doors or the Stones. While I enjoy and would recommend 4, make sure that you get the first three Sabbath albums and listen to them in succession to appreciate their impact and progression of the band."
2,no...,"there's three good songs...under the sun, supernaut and snowblind. they actually made two classics: sabotage and self-titled!"
5,excellent,One of Black Sabbath's best. Also has some of the heavist sabbath in Tommorow's dream and Under the Sun. They also go melodic in St. vituses dance and in Changes. This album is the height of Black Sabbaths creativitity and i would recomend to any fan.
2,Wheres the Heat,"Con(s): Does not iron well. The steam is great but not enough to compensate the lack of heat in the iron. Very disappointed with this iron. Biggest beef = This iron does not get hot enough for cotton fabric! 2. It is hard to direct the spray. 3. The power goes off (supposed to be a safety feature) and then you have to actually unplug it to reset it. Just using the dial does not reset the power. Ugh!! 4. It tips over easy on the board. Last beef = 5. It is hard to store because you can't wrap the cord around the handle to store it. (The handle design won't grab the cord, so you have to wait for the iron to cool completely and wrap it around the iron head.)And it tips easily on the shelf.Pro: The only pro is that the cord is nice and long and flexible. Really, that's all! Can't recommend this iron."
1,Drips constantly!!!,"I bought this iron to use while I sew. My first project was a satin bridesmaid dress...and this darned iron dripped and stained the fabric. No matter what settings, how much/little water was used, etc--NOTHING kept it from dripping!"
3,Not for the faint-hearted.....,"or those who shun manuals. I am a fairly computer-savvy person, but this handheld was difficult to use out of the box for me. The synchronization process failed numerous times initially. Then I downloaded the Windows XP update, but that was not a fix. I had to reset all factory defaults (i.e. wipe out all stored data & pgms) and then re-synch with the XP software on my PC.I still have problems with memory management but I think this is a part of the too-steep learning curve on the 548. In addition, the processor can be maddeningly slow for some tasks, like opening a low resolution (1 megapixel) photo file. This sluggishness is also apparent when multi-tasking (like reading mail while running MP3s in the background), often requiring a soft reboot (reset). The good things are the price, expandable storage (I have a 256 card for music and 1 for pics), sturdy build and excellent graphics. I'm not sorry I bought it, I just wish I had more time to learn its intricacies."
5,WOW! ! !,"I am very impressed with my Jornada 548. It is very very close to a desk top computer. You can type reports, work on spreadsheets and pretty much anything you would want. It is completely compatable with MS Outlook, MS Word, MS Excel. You can either type it in, at the expense of screen room, due to the fact the keyboard is displayed on the screen. The character reconision has three regions, CAPS, lowercaps and numbers, and I am told learns how you write and adjusts. Anyone who is looking for a GREAT Palm computer, look no further."
4,HP Support not there for me.,"I bought my HP 548 in good faith. Paid good money. When it came time to buy a battery, I got shuffled around the planet talking to the folks (support) in India whom were polite but didn't provide any answers. The result was, I was to the forced to buy (on my own) a questionable battery from another source which doesn't work (it seems to be counterfeit). I'm glad Carly is gone from HP.HP: How about supporting your products from now on ? Only thing is...I won't be among your customers. Ever."
5,Excellent Integrated Device for Most Needs,"I can trade in my Palm, my notebook PC, my RIO MP3 player, my Panasonic digital voice recorder, my books on tape cassettes...all for my one PocketPC. Awesome.It's fast, colorful, functional and packed with value. Whether I am using Outlook for my calendar and contacts or email, listening to MP3's, reading a book, listening to an audiobook in my car with the cassette adapter, taking notes at a meeting, recording voice notes while I drive...it does it all.I'm very happy with this phenomenal package."
2,"Clumsy, overpriced","I bought the Jordana as a replacement for my old Palm 3. I'm keeping it and some of the features are a real benefit. But in general it hasn't exceeded my expectations and in a lot of ways it's been a disappointment.The problems with earlier Windows CE handhelds haven't been addressed. It's poorly laid out, too many menus. Too many buttons for too little space. And despite its name, the Jordanas don't fit well in a pocket.I think Microsoft's problem with handhelds is they see the world in terms of Windows and keep trying to make the CEs more like the desktop OS. Rather than making the layout more simple and intuitive, Microsoft has added more applications.I'd advise others considering this model to get something cheaper for now, like a Palm model. Perhaps in 5 or 10 years Microsoft will get it right."
1,Display is a joke,Owned for two days. Saw a Compaq Ipaq and asked myself why theHP was the same price. I was extremely disapointed. I returned it andreceived a refund then ordered the Ipaq 3650. The display is horriblewhen compared to everything else and has the slowestprocessor.Microsoft has done a great job with the pocket pc platform.
4,Hudson Hornet,Looks Great and works great. My 3 year old daughter is a BIG fan of the movie CARS and has a Radiator Springs Rug that she drivers her cars around. She was very happy to find this in her Easter Basket to add to her collection of her favorite Cars.
2,Writer needs to revisit!,"Although the maps were helpful, much of this book seemed outdated. Addresses were wrong, business gone and reviews questionable."
1,don't waste your time and money,"I agree with the last reviewer, this book is way out of date and not worth spending the time reading. And I didn't really like the writing style, either, it felt stilted and it was hard to read--didn't flow, if you know what I mean. If you want to really develop your skills, go for something by someone with real credentials who actually knows what they're talking about."
5,If you're at all serious about volleyball you need this book,"Excellent drawings, crystal clear explanations. If you want a definitive reference for a variety of offensive and defensive schemes, and drawings that break down all the basic skills in detail, this is the book to buy."
3,A bit better.,"Better than ""The Neon Part 1 -The Rise"" but not enough to wake the neighbor. First of all Mr. Lawless should get a producer instead of him trying to control everything. I'm not sure people want conceptual album anymore! Don't try to re-do ""The Crimson Idol"", this isn't worth it anyway. Try something new or in the vain as ""The Headless Children"". Highlights: ""Never Say Die"", ""Clockwork Mary"" and .....more of the same."
3,Keeping up with The Makers,"This book, the sixth in the Alvin Maker series, is just as entertaining as the first five. I enjoy Card's style of writing and like the fact that he creates a historical science fiction so well. In this story many of the characters of previous books are reintroduced and the author, at times, only gives vague information as to their history in the story, so I don't suggest that anyone read this if they haven't read the other five (but of course the others were great too so there's no reason to not want to read them). I do feel that this book has less of ""something,"" but I'm not sure what exactly it is. I do still advise people to read it, especially if they're wondering what will happen to all these folks in the next book."
5,great buy,"i love this strap, i use it with my bass which isn't extremely heavy, but hey, its a bass. its just wide enough for a great fit over your shoulder. the leather is good quality, a sexy sleek black with the satisfying smell every time you pick up your instrument. my only concern is that it grips your shirt really well (the bottom side is a little rougher) which is a really good thing because it prevents the neck of the guitar from shifting position when you let go of it, but it does tend to bunch up your shirt on your shoulder a tad if its not placed right, but hey, maby its better when its more broken in. sounds scary, but its not, its benefits far outweigh the small drawback, great buy, go for it."
4,God's presence in everyday events.,"Sincere, beautifully written series of essays describe God's presence in everyday events. Ms. Eastman's own experiences illustrate her point that God is always available if we will but look for him all around us and let His guidance enrich our lives."
4,"This was a page turner,well writen","I enjoyed this book because, Harriet Tubman was a very strong woman.I thought she had some guts to escape.Even her brothers were afraid she went through with it.I think she was a person that looked through other peoples eyes."
2,"Great subject, tough read.","My fourth grade daughter is doing a book report on Harriet Tubman. I found Harriet to be a brave, strong and courageous woman. WoW! I know my daughter has learned a lot as well.I struggled with the writting in the book and found it was a tough read - not written very well.Sorry - if you need to do a report on Harriet Tubman - search out another book."
4,Does Your Vote Matter At All????,"This is a sobering book for anyone who thinks that their vote matters in our democracy. This book details how members of Congress are nothing more than pawns of big corporations and industry leaders. Not only does it expose how Congress is bought and sold, it also sheds light on how much time Congressional members spend begging for donations versus the time they should be spending dealing with the issues that they are put in place to solve.This book is disturbing, but it also illustrates how to solve the problem, and what some states have begun to do to solve this problem. Hopefully more people will realize that corporate money should not be running the country the way it is, and this book is a good place to begin with that lesson."
5,better than potato chips,"I brought a few bags to a work day in May, and people are still asking me about them, because you can't buy them in stores around here. They're a cross between the soy version of rice cakes and potato chips, but people eat them by the handful like potato chips. But instead of making you sluggish like a bag of chips, the soy protein gives you energy."
2,Informative docu/drama,"I had seen snippets of this film in other DVDs and the picture quality was very good. Being a Spitfire fan I had to have a copy of the full length feature film with the bonus materials.When the DVD arrived, I found that it was sourced from Rareaviation.com. The picture quality was very poor to say the least. It looks like someone had a poor quality VHS copy and had transferred it to DVD. I understand that it is an old film but I have many other films of similar vintage and I feel sure to say that there would be better copies of the film to be had. The only way to view the bonus materials was in my laptop as they are in Pdf format.The DVD came in a transparent plastic CD case and not a regular DVD case with a good quality colour slick. I was very disappointed allround.Would not recommend to anyone. I am considering buying a copy from Amazon.Co.UK who has a different supplier. Hope this review assists anyone considering buying a copy."
5,Seeds of Deception by Jeffrey M. Smith,This book gives information that all Americans should be made aware of - that our foods are being poisoned.
4,"Been there, Read that","Had to Purchase this book for a college class, didn't really enjoy this book as far as the topic, but that's all personal opinion.However, Book was in great shape as described and shipped fast."
4,Feast for Fido Fans,"Take the hard-boiled resourcefulness of a wrestling blind sleuth and his canny canine sidekick, stir in a stew of diverse supporting characters, and the result is the recipe for this wartime noir mystery. Donna Reed is delicious as a precociously hard-edged seventeen-year-old, and Mantan Moreland and Allen Jenkins add just the right dash of comic relief."
2,Postage an outrage,They made their money off of the postage alone. Really not nice charging per item when you did send all of them for the same price as one. Cost more to ship then the total cost of puchase. I can't speak to the quality of the product because I have not used them yet. Buyers beware of per item shipping cost. Rediculous!
5,"great product, extremely fast shipping",This is a great product. I use it for my MP3 player and it hold at least 500 songs
5,SanDisk,"It was part of agift of a Canon Digital Camera, also bought at Amazon.I presume it works well."
5,Great Product,I have never had a problem with anything from SanDisk. I have 2 2-gig cards and a 1-gig. I highly recommend this brand and their customer service is very helpful!
1,SD Card,The SD card was defective with a crack in the side and would not work in our cameras. Poor quality control.
2,I paid too much,It is what it is... a memory card.I paid too much. I found a good deal on a used one and put it in my amazon shopping cart. A week later the cart was full and I checked out. Later I found that I was charged full price for a new one.
5,Quality product,"SanDisk makes solid storage media, and this 2GB SD card is no exception. Use it for MP3s on my Treo phone, and it works great."
2,Average,"I purchased this card because of the price, not because it was the best product out there for my camera. My new camera can use the new SDHC cards and I have purchased one of those, and can notice a difference in speed. This card works well for older type cameras that will not accept the newer cards."
5,Plenty of memory,I don't know much about this stuff....but it has more memory than I will ever need. Good price. Fast delivery.
5,sandisk 2gb memory card review,Great for anyone who take lots of pictures an records videos. You won't need to worry about space. I prefer this way more than any 1gb memory card.
3,"Stores data, but...","There seems to be an odd glitch with this card - it doesn't allow me to copy several sub-folders at a time from my PC to the card. After copying one subfolder, I'd get an error, something referring to an ""invalid DOS command"" (I'm using Windows XP), when it tried to copy the 2nd subfolder. If I popped the card out of my PC and then popped it back in, it would then copy the other subfolder, but again, only 1 at a time. So, I had to pop it in and out a bunch of times.Other than that, though, it works great! Super speedy and nice and small. I'm using it with my Palm TX and am happy with it overall."
1,Excessive Shipping Charges,I was charged $19.96 for shipping 3- SanDisks weighing 8oz. or less!This was shipped via USPS Ground. I'm asking for a CREDIT!Allan WattAt this point I do not recommend JoWow!!!!!!!!!!
1,seller review -beware,I would NEVER purchase anything from this seller again. This card stopped working in just a day over 3 weeks. The seller has a policy of two weeks. I have several cards from other companies that are working just fine and I have had them for 2-3 years with heavy use. I would certainly NOT recommend buying anything from this seller.
5,Video picture frame? Get this storage card!!!,"Just bought a video picture frame that had a little bit of internal storage. I put this little sucker in, and that thing will show pictures all day without repeating any of them. A great bargain for a great price. Use it as a thumb drive if you have a USB adapter for it. You won't be disappointed."
5,SD card for Cuddeback Trail Camera,I use these in my Cuddeback Capture Trail Camera. I just leave the camera mounted and trade out the cards to look at those Big Bucks.Cuddeback Cameras won't work with the HCSD (High Capacity SD Cards).
4,Prompt order delivery,eTech was very prompt in the delivery of my memory cards. I would recommend them highly. Thanks!
5,Reasonably priced and reliable,"No complaints at all. So far both cards --I use them in two cameras I have-- have delivered. One of the cameras has filming capabality, and a memory card of at least 2 gigs is a must-have. As for still pictures, it is always good to have storage room to spare."
2,"Beware, fewer bytes than other 2GB Manufacturers","The description says 1GB = 1,000,000,000 bytes and some are not available. Alright, I was warned. My application did not fit on the SanDisk 2GB SD card and it does fit on the OCZ 2GB SD card.Windows XP reports:SanDisk: 1,975,255,040 bytesOCZ: 2,038,038,528 bytesI bought 3 SanDisks and the space is consistentI have 7 OCZ and the space is consistent"
3,Great product for less than the retail stores....high shipping!,"The 2.0 GB SanDisk is a great price and substantially less than the department stores. However, beware of the shipping - the shipping is very high and once shipping is added in, you are almost at a point where it is worthwhile to consider going to the store and you will get the product much faster. While delivery is certainly part of the luxury involved in online ordering, the delivery charges on this item were approximately 85% of the item cost. In other words, I paid $8.19 for the product and $6.95 for the shipping."
5,2 gb sandisc,"Bought this item to go with my first digital camera (Pentax optio e40)Since I have no experience with memory cards I can only say its working fine, some pictures fantastic, some not so great, but its myself who has to learn everything about using the camera. The price for this product was great( $15.87). After looking at prices for other memory cards this was a great buy. Did have some questions however. When I first inserted the card and was learning how to use the camera, I brought up very very faint images of someone elses production. 2 faint images. These were not sample pictures, something totally different with a page of production credits etc. and really wondered if the disc was recycled. It was packed as completely new and as I said I have not had any problems with it but I am curious about the 2 faint images."
5,"Better golf, more strength, enhanced flexibility...superb!","Advanced power golf is a wonderful learning tool!...Gerry Jame's swing is technically perfect...his instruction is precise and easy to understand. He emphasizes flexibility and strength training as an adjunct to hitting the golf ball better and more powerfully. My handicap dropped from 8 to 4 in 2 months and I picked up 15 to 20 yds on my drives. I even won the NJ, NY, DE qualifying for the RE/Max long drive, senior division. This video is a must for golfers looking to build a correct, powerful, repeating swing. And it's a must for anyone wanting to become maximally physically fit."
5,Incredible,"I took this CD out of my library just today and decided I have to own it. I have never heard harmonies like this - they sound almost medieval; minor and major weave together in a musical tapestry that makes you want to weep. Listen to this as you read, ""Irish Hunger"" and you just may feel the presence of your celtic ancestors whispering in your ear."
3,amazing grace,"I enjoy the music on this CD by Mr Daniel Lanois. ACADIE features many well-known artists in the recording industry. Names which are familiar to those who have followed the production career of Mr Lanois. Among the talented gentlemen are, Mr Tony Hall, the Eno brothers, the Neville brothers, Mr Larry Mullen Jr. and Mr Adam Clayton, both from the band U2. For this reason alone, I was interested in this CD. The songs are pleasant accoustic tunes which are influenced to a degree by the cajun style, especially noticeable in ""Jolie Louise"" and ""Under a Stormy Sky"". I particularly enjoy the sensual and seductive feel of ""Where the Hawkwind Kills"". From U2 albums, I recognised the the fingerprint of Mr Lanois on the haunting version of ""Amazing Grace""."
5,Dankeschön,"After ordering a CD from Medimops for under $4 I read several negative reviews about the company ranging from ""I never got my order"" to ""I rec'd the wrong CD"" and ""I rec'd my order but the CD was scratched"".I rec'd my order ""Acadie"" Daniel Lanois in 6 days in immaculate condition! I am very impressed that after scouring local record stores in the States I was able to grab the CD I wanted for less than $5 and was delivered at my doorstep from overseas in less than a week.I would defin. order from Medimops again!"
3,Not what I expected,"I purchased this based on the song ""My Jolie,"" but the rest of the music is very different...not to my liking. My fault for not listening to the samples first. I wish I had not spent as much money on it."
1,Deceptive title,"The consensus is that this book is not very good. The title is suspiciously similar to ""500 Low-carb Recipes"" by Dana Carpender, which is highly recommended."
4,Definitely worth buying,"The 2nd song really stands out and I could listen to it over and over for hours. The rest of the album is also very good, though very soothing, so -- truckers, don't pop in this CD late at night when you're hauling that hazardous material. If you like Lyle Lovett, you should really check out Lucinda Williams! You won't be sorry!"
4,Really great cd,"I really like this cd and I want to give it 5 stars, but something is just holding me back. I'm a lyle lovett fan, and I think the only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is b/c it was recommended so highly to me by a couple of my friends. I really like it, but it's just not up to the standards that I had given it. As you can see, I realize this, but that doesn't change the fact that, to me, it's still only a 4 out of 5 star cd."
5,as good as everybody else says,"It's stupid to add my two cents to an already glowing pile of reviews, but I will, simply out of love and respect for this recording. Objectively, Joshua Judges Ruth is witty, poignant, fun, rollicking, heart-felt, cynical and sincere. Subjectively, it changed the way I listen to American music. If Lyle ever makes a movie as good as this cd, I'm predicting Sundance or Cannes. Don't hold your breath for that, just get this cd."
5,Rugged,"We have taken this carrier on 3 trips to the snow and rain and sleet. Everything comes out dry and it doesn't move around when driving. Two people can get it on and off the top of the Odyssey with ease and tying it down is not a problem, although I used extra rigging in addition to what the company supplied. A great product for the price."
5,The Land Before Time - Mysterious Island,"My grandchildren, ages 5 and 7, love the Land Before Time series. These movies are always appreciated for their ability to get the children settled for an hour or so while grownups talk. There is always a moral to the story and an example of ""helping"" someone else."
2,Yawn! B-o-r-i-n-g!,"It is cute, but it's nothing exciteing. I like the fact that they have his parents purr like cats. (Carnivores rock!)"
5,3-year old review,"My three-year-old daughter loves this movie. She repeatly watches it and even sings along with all of the songs. I sometimes even find my nine-year-old son watching the movie with her. We all love this movie because it teaches morals and lessons to the children without lecturing them. This is an overall wonderful movie and my daughter and I would recommend it to everyone, but I still think the 1st movie is the best of them all."
4,One of our favorites in the Land Before Time series,"Our children are big Land Before Time fans, and The Mysterious Island ranks as one of their favorites. They really enjoyed the exciting storyline which follows the dinosaur friends as they move to a mysterious island in search of food. Highlights of the film include the return of Chomper (the t-rex) and some really cute songs. ""Big Water"" gets all my children singing along, and ""Always There"" is a sweet and memorable tune. A very likable movie which got a thumbs up from my 8 year old down to my 2 year old!"
2,Can't Say..Well Much of Anything,"The subject matter of this movie is very important and represents a time in American history that needs to be unearthed, visualized, and discussed. This movie, however, is just not the way to go about it. There was not much depth to any of the characters. The plot was weak and alot of the scenes felt like they were just filler and served no purpose really, especially the scene where they were playing pool and the scenes with Rain's mother which could have been utilized to give the characters depth but remained underused. I did not believe Rain at all, the acting wasn't very good in my opinion. The two stars are for the subject of the film and for two actors, Wes Studi, whose character was the most interesting. Also for an appearance by Adam Beach who tried but had little to do in the film."
5,Wonderful,"Bought it, loved it and spread the word...A must see for those who were not taught this story in classrooms across America...excellent cast and writing...highly recommend..."
5,So much fun!,"This is a really fun French-Canadian folk album that includes a lot of toe-tapping tunes, including a traditional drinking song and a ""nonsense"" song. Note that the lyrics are in French, although the liner notes are in English."
1,Do not buy this.,"It's amazing to think I spent nearly 40 dollars on this. This wheel is probably worth 5 dollars at a used parts store. With the PS2, there's about a 40 degree play... in other words, nothing happens until you turn the wheel almost completely, at which point the direction is maxed and any game you're playing you wipe out. The pedals are too close together and almost impossible to use. It's impossible to mount and use effectively. On the PC, your system will lag so badly, it will make any game unplayable. This is completely useless and i threw it away after one use, with no regrets. I watch every penny I spend, I feel like a huge fool for wasting my hard earned money on this horrible piece of plastic."
3,Not The Wheel For Learning Driving Techniques,"Seeking something that could offer a realistic driving experience without actually being on the road, I ordered the Genius Twin Vibration Feedback F1 Racing Wheel. I thought that this, in addition to SimuRide Home Edition which is a driving simulator for beginners, would help my son prepare for his road test and for driving in general. The PC ""game"" is stunning. Three-dimensional graphics and realistic scenarios teach the would-be driver how to respond under a wide range of situations. I wish I could say the same for this wheel. The vibrations and physical reactions of the wheel to what is happening on the screen is cartoon-like, meant more for dramatic effect than to teach any realistic lessons."
2,Arrived broken.,The wheel looks good and feels like it's built well for a $35 steering wheel...but it arrived with what sounded like a screw or piece of plastic rattling around in the steering wheel body. It also didn't work right. I assume something broke during shipping but the box and package were completely unharmed. Returning for my money back and getting a better wheel.
1,Rip off,This was not the right item and when you return it you have to pay a 15% restocking fee. If you are going to sell the item clearly make sure it is stated that it is only for a ps2 and pc. When you look up a racing wheel and foot pedals for a ps3 this item comes up. I will not be recommending this company.
4,"It works, just not enough control","I bought this for me and my son. We both play some racing games on the PS2, and we play NFS as well. This steering wheel wasn't used long, for only one reason: that it just doesn't offer the same kind of control as the original hand controls do. The steering wheel only moves a half turn to the left, and a half turn to the right. So, it takes a while to really get used to keeping your car on the road with it. It is fun having an accelerator and brake pedal at first, but again, it just doesn't allow you to make those tiny movements when you need to.You get what you pay for. Otherwise, it works fine with the PS2."
3,bare bones,"This camcorder has good picture and sound quality, but comes with no software (nor is any availible) to transfer dv to computer via firewire. Also battery life is about 20min not 1.5hrs."
1,Suddenly stopped working,"I purchased this camera in August of 2002 and have taken very good care of it. I have only used for aprox. 8 hours of recording. I powered on the camera, finished the tape that was currently in the recorder, and it suddenly powered off. I had noticed the battery was fully charged when I was recording so I knew it wasn't a battery issue. We then found there was no way to manually eject the tape since it is a motorized ejection process. We contact Sharp who suggested to remove the battery and reseat (which we had already tried) and if that did not help then it would have to be sent to a service center for $$$'s. The quality is very disappoining considering the camcorder was used so little and was always taken care of. We eventually took the camcorder apart ourselves destroying it just to salvage the video tape inside since it is more cost effective to purchase a new recorder than to send $$$'s to repair a junk camcorder."
1,Worst tech book ever.,"I am writing this in hopes that no one will make the same mistake and buy this book. This book was of no help to me what so ever during my Exchange install. The book is poorly written. The chapter order makes no sense at all. The index is useless. The whole book seems to be written to tell about Exchange 2000, but not give any useful information. The authors should be ashamed, and I think they would be, but I don't think they read the book."
2,EXPECTED IT TO BE BETTER,THE STORY OUTLINE SOUNDED INTERESTING BUT THE BOOK WAS JUST TOO TEDIOUS TO STICK WITH. VERY DISAPPOINTING.
1,Grizzly could NOT possibly have made this hood.,"Compared to other Grizzly designed products, this hood falls well short of the mark in terms of finish, but especially FIT. When the hood arrived, it appeared as a piece of thin grade metal, shaped into a tube and painted with black enamel. Instructions were a Zeroxed line drawing. And when I actually attached the hood to the planer, I felt like I had just got taken for one more add on purchase.I'll be designing my own.And I'll paint it Grizzly green."
5,A must-have for Tannie-fans,"If you really are into the Tannies or want to be and don't have this album, you really don't know what you're talking about. It's all in here - stunning instrument artistics, wonderful voice arrangements and quiet ballads. It is an older but in no way outdated album of this timeless kind of music..."
5,Mutts not a mutt!,"Having occassionally read this strip in a newspaper I don't regularly purchase, I knew I wanted to see more of it, and so I ordered the first collection. Believe me, I'm ordering ALL the collections! This is a whimsical bit of fun, featuring, especially, a cat that brings back memories of two other wacky felines, Mehitabel and Krazy Kat. At times, I grinned. At times, I grinned with empathy. At times, I laughed out loud. If you like dogs, or love cats, or both, or just enjoy a good laugh, I heartily recommend this book...and the others in the series that I WILL be ordering!"
4,Pretty good story,"Two (2) excellent actors. Great story. Hated Mother-in-law. Tooooo Devoted daughter makes a dumb, neglectful wife. Morris was tooo good a man to neglect. Taraji's character was stupid. I actually wanted him to leave her. She did not deserve him. I could not believe this grown woman let her mother come into her home and regulate. Her behavior in the restaurant was almost unforgiveable. Good Movie."
2,Not the best,"I am a collector of DVD's. When I first heard that Bishop T.D. Jakes had something to do with this movie I had to get it. However, this is not one of the greatest movies I have seen."
2,Low Budget movie,"The movie content was reality, however the basement area or room where he went to listen to his music was verging on a low budget style movie."
4,Great display of real relationship issues,"TD Jakes does a great job with this film. You will laugh, maybe cry, and relate to the hardships faced by the characters."
5,Fabulous Movie,"Not a typical ""Christian"" movie. Doesn't preach at you but lays out the consequences of selfish behavior, especially if your marriage is supposed to be Christ based. Every couple getting married should watch this movie."
3,Same o Story,This is a good movie but it reminds me of Diary of a mad black woman only the woman gets hurt and the man is not the bad guy in the relationship. Shows just how ungrateful some woman are.
2,NOT For Family Viewing For Sure,"We are pretty careful about what we watch, and when we saw this was a novel by TD Jakes, we decided to invest some time in it. The video says inspirational and hilarious. My husband kept asking when it was going to be funny. It is a serious drama, very intense, with several plots, from a woman who is injured in an accident while driving with her husband to a boy who is emotionally abused by his dad. There are many good lessons, from marriage partners that neglect each other, to people who deal with real life situations that can impact marriage and home life, to an over involved mother-in-law. What I did not expect was how serious this movie was and I was appalled by the word as_ that was repeated in it over and over by all ages. Lessons can be learned but it is not family watching in the least. Wouldn't watch it again."
4,"A good, solid marriage-oriented movie","Not Easily Broken is a movie about the struggles one particular marriage goes through. Because many of the problems are common ones - ill health, money problems, personal conflicts, interfering in-laws - many can relate to this film. I agree that this movie isn't a family one, but it IS a good couples movie. There may be swearing in it - I don't know because we have something on our television set called TV Guardian that bleeps out swear words - but it had enough good points in it to merit recommendation."
2,"bottles crack over time, Playtex is taking care of me","We have been using this bottle since our son was 3 months old. We really liked them even though you have to take them apart and put them together. Unfortunatly my son in only nine months old and everyone of the six I have are cracked at either the top or bottom. Two of them are cracked so bad that they are unusable. Because of the cracking I am going to have to buy him new bottles for the last few months until he turns one. In my opinion, bottles should last more than six months. One good thing is that Playtex is replacing all my bottles. They are sending me a postage paid mailer to mail my bottles back and coupons for new bottles."
4,"Good bottle, easy cleaning","I tried these bottles hoping my baby would like them but unfortunately, she still refused to accept them over the breast. She did use them a few times though and didn't have a problem with excess gas or anything.I think the nipples were a little hard but most silicone ones are. We traded to some Playtex latex nipples, which fit perfectly and were softer, more like the breast. She actually drank 4 oz out of it with that nipple.I like that they were different colors and easy to clean because the bottoms come off. I would recommend these to others."
2,A lot more small parts to deal with than other bottles,"We had these playtex bottles and breastflow bottles. There are two main things I do not like about the playtex bottles:1) If you don't screw in the bottom properly, they will obviously leak. At 3am and half awake having to deal with screwing in the bottom part and the top part is a real pain. I would prefer something simpler.2) The parts are small and I found would always fall through the racks in my dishwasher. This was really annoying. I didn't have any problem with the breastflow bottles."
1,HATE THESE BOTTLES,"We had all kinds of bottles in our house. We bought these to try and used it maybe 5 times total. Too many pieces, a pain to clean, and the nipple is SO SLOW FLOWING! This is not a ""middle of the night"" feeding friendly bottle .It took our son an additional 15 minutes to get this bottle down with the same amount of fluid in it as compared to the other bottles we had. We will NEVER use this bottle again. We threw them away!"
2,"They use to be good, Not any more","I used these type of bottles several years ago and had no problems except they would leak out of the bottom if the disk was not put in correctly. However, since they have redesigned them, they are not very good. The bottle itself works good, but the nipples are horrible. The stage 1 nipple, the hole is so small that my newborn was having to suck so hard that it would put him to sleep with out eating very much. I changed the nipples to the stage 2 and now the milk comes out to fast for the baby, so he would start to gag while sucking on these bottles. I have changed bottle systems for his regular bottles and use these bottles when I add cereal in his formula. Since it makes the formula thicker, my baby doesn't gag when he uses these bottles. I would suggest using these bottles only if the baby is older, approx. 3 months."
1,Leaky and slow,"Don't remember how we got these bottles, but I'm pretty sure we got them free with some promotion. Now I know why. They do not have good flow through the nipples, which makes feedings last forever. The bottoms are also designed poorly and leak everywhere."
5,Dont complain if you didnt read directions!!,Everyone leaving bad reviews are not following directions. The first step is to boil nipple and vent for 5 minutes before first use and weekly thereafter. This prevents nipple collapse and slow flow! There is a reason why these are so expensive. They are the best bottles out there with a little extra effort. Don't be discouraged by poor reviews. They work very well.
1,horrible horrible -- leaks after a few washings,"One of the biggest sources of my frustration after having a baby is just when I start feeding a hungry baby his milk, the bottle pours out over half of it all over a clean baby -- wasting breastmilk or formula, getting a clean baby dirty, his shirt all wet, and making him cry horribly because I have to pull the bottle away -- the bottles worked great for the first month I had them (I bought about 5 because I liked them) -- but now they are warped and the tops don't fit properly on I feel like I want my money back -- it's so frustrating to go to feed your baby and end up pouring the milk all over him."
2,Not worth the money.,"I chose this bottle system for my son after reading so many great reviews, and even bought one and ran it through the dishwasher to test for leaks...no leaks...They worked well, UNTIL recently. My son is 4 months old and they all LEAK. Constantly. I fill one up to put it in the diaper bag and within a half hour it's empty. They aren't very durable, the plastic on the rings is actually breaking off and now I'm going through the struggle of trying to find a new bottle system that my son will take (I hate the liners)...And they never did reduce the amount of air in the bottle at all. Do not buy these bottles unless you want to buy a completely new system in 4 months."
2,Problem with bottle flow,"I bought these for my daughter thinking that maybe they wouldn't leak like the last ones I had used. They don't leak, but the stage 1 is TOO slow and frustrates her. She's 5 months and the stage 2 is TOO fast. They made a HUGE mistake in not making more stages. Had I realized this before I had used them, I would have taken them all back."
1,HORRIBLE,The last thing any new parent needs is a hassle. These bottles are the hardest thing to not only put together EVERY time but worse to clean(forget sanitizing)!!We would have to unscrew the bottom to keep the nipple from collapsing and pray our lil guy did not hit the bottle and spill it.The only thing positive about this bottle is the story I get to tell about the time the bottom plastic piece was sucked in by my lil guy creating a pop so loud that I flew up in the air pouring formula all over us. If we only had the camera out.I can laugh now.Aventi bottles work pretty well.
3,"I thought they looked great, but my baby hated em.","My little one really got angry over the slow flow of the stage one nipples. although she was young for it, I got her the next ones up and that was entirely too fast. I never could get her to take to these bottles. If she had to spend any length working to get her food on the slower nipples, she'd turn around and really scream if I tried to nurse her since she was too tired and gassy. Faster flow, gagging child and still lot of gas.I loved the way they broke down, but the plastic inserts and the angles never did seem to do anything better about gas than my Avent bottles. It was honestly when I used the wide mouth Handi-craft Dr. Brown bottles that I started really noticing a difference. If you nurse too.... her latch got better with the Dr. Brown's, and after getting rid of these."
5,"Great product, great price","Honestly...my review is very similar to what others are saying. These bottles are easy to hold and easy to clean because it does break down into pieces. I think that the price is great for what the product is, and I like the color variety. I agree that the bottles do not leak as long as you screw them together correctly. As for how much the bottles hold true to their claim? Not sure! First baby! So my reference of more or less is undetermined! So far so good though!"
5,an unusually likable singer-songwriter,"I've had this album for over a week, and it's spent nearly all that time in the disc drive, a treatment heretofore achieved by Joseph Arthur and just about no one else since Tears for Fears in their prime. The ten songs here are intriguingly written, involvingly played, and energetically sung. Greg Aaron has a beautiful voice, light and supple and eminently listenable. After many listens, I find myself singing along with the cd and even, at times, singing the songs around the house.Through his songs, Greg Aaron reveals himself as someone very much worth getting to know."
1,An unbalanced account that often appears quite malicious,"Sure Medjugorje has attracted some quite unsavoury adherents; particularly the American 'Medjugorje Mafia'. However, to condemn the whole phenomenon through this 'guilt by association' tactic is pretty wearisome and, when sustained through the entire book, proves to be a massive turn off. There is a large amount of factual error in this investigation.There are some downright malicious allegations made against many of those whose have been positively inspirational - in particular Father Jozo Zofko.The dignity and integrity of the visionaries themselves acts as a counterbalance to some of the appalling claims in this sad and at times pathetic attempt to demolish Medjugorje.James Mulligan"
4,Schwarz's Review Was Very Biased,"I bought this book because I believed in what Andy Schwarz said on his review, about how great this book was for on-line gamers. But I fail to see how this book can be of much help to on-line gamers as a strategy guide.Indeed, the book talks about how much fun multi-player games can be, how different they can differ from single-player games, and on-line etiquette. Besides a few paragraphs about civilization selection, I don't see any multi-player gaming strategy in this book. The two chapters devoted to multiplayer games, i.e. chapters 11 and 12, have only a total of 7 pages combined.Although I am not disappointed at the other parts of this book, I would not advertise nor recommend it as a strategy guide for on-line gamers."
4,CLASSIC JAZZ AT ITS FIVE CHANNEL FINEST,"Dave is doing anything extraordinary or groundbreaking here, but he has never been that type of musician. He and his band are simply offering up some fine, tasty classic jazz in glorious 5 channel sound. Nice, even, clean mix that enhances the original recording with good, consistent use of the rear and center channels."
5,OUTSTANDING! Grab a teapot & BUY THIS BOOK!,"This book is WONDERFUL! Be forewarned, however: you WILL begin to guzzle litre after litre of tea during the reading of this book. Mr. Goodwin gives an absolutely wonderful first-person account of his often hilarious travels investigating the tea trade, from its' beginnings in Canton to the present day. A MUST for anyone who loves tea - and I'd rate Mr. Goodwin's writing style on a par with Pico Iyer's. A good read, full of humour and information..."
1,Fake Funk,This is one of the worst albums George Clinton has produced...period! This was a funkless album with no flavor whatsoever.Avoid this album if you are a P-Funk fan!
1,Great sound to the jingle,I will be using the jingles for Praise Dancing. They have a tambourine like sound and beat to them. So using them in music will be fun. The handle makes it esy to grip onto.
3,Not up to hype,"It might not be fair to rate this game on expectations. There was so much hype about this game it would have been difficult to live up to expectations but this game wasn't even close.It was way too easy for one. Being able to easily beat a RPG game within a few days is totally not cool. The fighting was way too easy and even with every choice having a consequence I wasn't impressed; wow I can replay and turn out looking different. Whoopee. The fact I could get married and have kids was mildly amusing for all of three seconds, the ability to fart and belch to effect peoples opinion of you made me feel I was playing a game targeted at ten year olds, and there really wasn't the complex class system we had been promised.I was also extremely annoyed by the map and terrain system. After playing Morrowind I expected a similar world where I could go anywhere at anytime.Don't make the mistake I did and shell out $50. Wait for a decent used copy a year or two from now."
4,John Wayne and William Holden in Union Blues,"I first saw this movie on television some time ago. I wanted to obtain it so I coule be free to watch it again when the desire struck me. I especially liked it when the ""sawbones"" (William Holden) and the troops boss (John Wayne) go at loggerheads on occasion when something the other was planning on doing didn't please the other. II think ""Horse Soldiers"" is worth viewing time and again.Horse Soldier Horse Soldier"
1,Blu-Ray Review,As far as blu-ray goes this movie is no better than a standard dvd. I purchased this from Amazon and it will be going back.
3,John Wayne Deserves Better,"The video quality of this film suffers in that landscape scenes are fuzzy, but the close ups are very good. The duke is an icon and his films should be shown the utmost respect ... but did not get it. Let UCLA do the restoration next time. They did a great job with Sherlock Holmes DVD series (they did not do the Blu Ray). Still, it's an enjoyable film.It should be priced around $8.00."
3,Not one of my Ford/Wayne favorites.,"I was looking forward to watching this (or re-watching it...I'm sure I have seen it before over the years...maybe 40 years ago or more!), because the other movies directed by Ford and starring John Wayne are so good. Well, this one was just ""OK"". I thought the plot jumped all over the place making it hard to remember what they were supposed to be doing on their little excursion. The dialogue, especially that of Wayne's character, was wooden and corny. I actually thought the woman who played Hannah, did a better job acting and delivering her lines (although I did wonder how she managed to keep perfect pink lipstick on her mouth no matter what hardships she endured!). Ah well, not every John Wayne movie can be iconic!"
2,A Big Disappointment.,"No in depth analysis of why the 'injun' image persists throughout American and European history. This book is more of a chronicle of the Indian as portrayed in American and European art and film. This book was incredibly disappointing as I was looking for a harder read but if someone is only looking for a summary of Indians in film or perhaps a filmography, this is where to start.The delivery of the book was prompt and it was in pristine condition. No disappointments there."
4,Can't Top Drunken Lullabies,"Flogging Molly is one of my favorite bands. They are one of those bands that, for me, will always be great no matter what other music I listen to at the time. When they came out with their ""Drunken Lullabies"" album, I didn't think anything would top it. And I was right. ""Within A Mile Of Home"" is a very good album. I respect it very much. But it lacks the energy that ""Drunken Lullabies"" delivered on every song, even if it was slow. That dosen't mean this isn't good though. Everyone should be able to enjoy tracks like ""Screaming At The Wailing Wall"", ""Seven Deadly Sins"", ""To Youth"" and ""Light Of A Fading Star"", among others. And don't listen to the guy who said they abandoned their Irish sound because that just isn't true. Listen to this album and hear for yourself. All in all, a good release, which I reccomend, but not their best."
5,Great Camera,I bought this on Amazon[.com] and had absolutely no problems. I think the camera is great quality. So far the battery has lasted me for my full outings. Memory card when in highest picture quality holds over 60 pics. Comes with the cables to hook up to your computer and your TV. Great deal for a great camera. Software for picture editing is not included.
5,Great digicam,"I don't know what the previous reviewer's problem is, but I've been able to stream directly off of the camera to a PC though the firewire interface using Windows XP Moviemaker."
1,INTESE DEBT,This product equals trouble the screen broke and now i have to replace it! I really hate the placement of that [silly] screen...ahhh
1,Go away from this trouble,"I had horrible time with this camcorder.It has a lot of advanced features but very easy to broken The service center is only available at NY and CA, costs much more money to repair than buy it.Don't spend your money on trouble."
3,Goku and Vegeta's fight not included,"Don't think because you're buying a boxed set you'll get to see the whole story from start to finish. I was disappointed to learn you don't get to see the final fight between Goku and Vegeta. After all, that's what the whole story is leading up to. You will need to buy the Departure CD (1st CD in the Namek Saga boxed set) to see the final battle between Goku and Vegeta. Also, this is an edited version which may be disappointing to anime fans."
2,The english version for DBZ is lousy,"I can't believe what the english market has done to this awesome piece of art. They just didn't have enough changing the opening song but they had to include some weird music to the series and cut most of the more dramatic scenes. Translation is bad , even the voices that they gave to the characters dont fit with their personalities. The DBZ saga is still good but the thing that irritates me the most is that they replace the music for some rock kinna music that just tells u even more that ur not watching the real deal."
1,"I Want to Hear This, But I've Been Scared Off...","After reading all the reviews, I must take issue with the comment about listeners ""taking some initiative"" in order to be able to listen to this album on their ipod, etc. Wake up! They paid their hard earned money for it. Sony is punishing the PAYING music lover, the iPod user, (by making him/her go through hoops), and the lover of Burt Bacharach, INSTEAD of punishing those who are getting music illegally. Am I the only one who thinks that's nuts? Since when did listening to music become that hard? There are way too many choices on Amazon to waste ANY time at all considering buying something you may not be able to play. Sorry, Burt, I love Painted From Memory, but I'm moving on. NEXT!"
1,Am returning it,I am very disappointed to hear of the copy protection system as I want to use this on my ipod. The CD is already being shipped to me and so will be returned unopened. I'll buy the UK version which apparently has no such problems.Will write a review of the music when I receive the UK version
2,Not what I was hoping for . . .,"This was my first Brooklyn Tabernacle CD. I had heard their arrangments of How Great Thou Art and Hallelujah Chorus. I hoped the rest of the CD would be as original--it's not. Most of the arrangments are so mainstream, they sound like any other choir performing them (with the exception of Soon and Very Soon.)Perhaps the problem is that a 'best of' album gets watered down. If you are looking for good singing and standard arrangments, this is a fine recording. If you want creative innovations or original sound, look for a different CD."
2,Not one of their better cd's.,"I have their first cd and loved it so much I play it everyday at least once a day. This cd didnt' even sound like the same choir. I didn't enjoy any of the songs. Not a good cd for me, as I like to listen to every song and then decide what to put on my iPod, since I saw the name and I liked their first cd, I just knew this was going to be a great cd. Boy was I wrong."
4,Nice!,I really like the idea of this play food set...cutting board and knife. Most of the food is seperated now but I'll find the pieces...
5,Daughter Loves This,"This was perfect for my daughter in her play kitchen. Learning names of items and hand-eye coordination ""chopping her veggies""."
1,CRAP!,This has never worked since I got it! It almost burnt up my camera when I plugged it in to charge. I should have bought the one at Wal-mart instead!
3,Disappointing,"I expected to have all available USB connectors. I need a very small or ""mini"" usb for my Nikon S8100. It was not included. Makes the device much less useful."
5,Unfairly criticized classic,"I pray that the reviewers who buried this movie meant no real disrespect. You have to place this movie in context, i.e., the period, the technical capabilities of the time, and the budget. Yes, the special effects were cheesy. Some times though real, actual motion looks more realistic than animation. Digitally animated creatures are too perfect, therefore unrealistic in a bizzare way. Also, place Japanese monster movies in context. These creatures are a metaphor for the nuclear menace. Godzilla was radioactive, the Gappas have some sort of electrical field. Today, this context has been lost. Or has it?"
2,Another bad monster movie.,"The creatures in this film do get to do what monsters do best, and that's about all it has going for it. I was impressed with the amount of screen time dedicated to watching giant monsters trash villages, suburbs, cities, temples and factories. It makes me wish better monster movies spent more time with the monster, without losing the plot of course. Instead we get things like Cloverfield which barely shows any of the monster at all! They're called ""Monster"" Movies not ""Annoying Screaming People With Bad Camera Angles"" Movies. Although the problem with this movie is the 'special effects' aren't very special, and while the story follows the classic ""take baby monster away from parents, parents come to get their baby back and tear stuff up."" theme, you've really got to be in the mood to watch this one."
4,GAPPAS ARE ANGRY,"My family name is Gappa - We are truly an angry people and you DO NOT want to tick us off! I felt sorry for them (though I am biased for my family) being harrassed and shot at for just trying to get what is rightly theirs - their baby.I now know where my goofy nose comes from! I only wish that I could fly or have that laser beam thing come from my mouth - I did get the inherited ability to destruct things while just walking around, though.All in all, it is a good story. Someone mentioned a rubber man suit - I couldn't tell because the family resemblance was uncanny."
4,Heavy dude,"This is a band that I have been hearing a lot about over the years. They have been around for ten years and have had a lot of impact. They definitely were heard by DFA 1979, Wolf Eyes, and The Locust. And plenty of other bands. They definitely have had an impact on some crazy Japanese bands like DMBQ. This is two-man heavy rock. This is a good place to start for people like me who are often late to the game. Three or four songs into this and it's totally relentless. This music needs to be heard in all its loudness. I hate those old people who have earplugs. What the hell are you listening to? I am listening to this record right now (track six) and my hearing is damaged. But I am hearing this in all its glory. I don't think this is a record for mellow people or people with a heart condition. This is excellent."
1,"Wow! HUGE Disappointment! Not in the movie itself, though...","Don't let the title of this review mislead you. I am a HUGE fan of this movie! It's the fact that this particular version of the film looks HORRIBLE! The picture quality sucks! The images are all dark and it's set up for standard format, unlike the Anchor Bay version, which I wound up ordering after I saw this version.The DVD menu looks like my 9 year old put it together! This has to be some sort of foreign version or something, but this particular DVD version is crap. Even watching it on an HDTV won't help. The quality of this DVD is awful. Went to a video store and got a few bucks credit trading it in for another movie.Make sure if you're going to by this movie that it is the distributor is ANCHOR BAY. Very disappointed."
4,Nothing is more amusing than a bad 80s flick.,"It's already been said by everyone else. This movie is so bad its good. I bought it for 3.99 on a closeout rack. In the DVD menu they even mis-spelled the word ""start,"" as in ""STRAT movie"" and how can anybody not love Roddy Piper from ""They Live"" fame?But whatever you do, do NOT pay the 22 dollars these shmucks want for it. Unless of course you bought ""Jackass: The Movie"" or ""Freddy vs. Jason"". Then, well, go ahead. You deserve to be ripped off."
1,Was not effective in increasing the humidity of my apt.,"I've had this unit for three years and was hoping it would service my one bedroom apartment. After three years, I have to say that I'm disappointed with my purchase. Even when I used this in my bedroom with the door closed (1/3 of my apartment), the unit still failed to raise the humidity of the room much higher than say 40%. While I still use the unit, thinking it at least provides a cleaning benefit, I now use the Air-o-Swiss product. Lastly, I don't recommend the oils/scents that can be added to the water - I think they gum-up the fan and underlining of the cover."
1,Disappointing,"Now, usually when I see ""green beret"" and ""alien princess"" in the same plot description, I tend to drop the book like a hot potato. In this case, however, I also saw ""dragon"" and decided to take a chance. I should've trusted my original instincts. I don't like him, and I strongly dislike her. The story line was vaguely interesting, but doesn't really grab your attention and kinda jumps from place to place. We've met, but the readers will get bored with that eventually so let's take a ride out into the wilderness, well this can't be fun to read about, let's find a dragon! Overall it was rather boring and I couldn't even bring myself to finish it, got close, but then it began to seem more like torture than a simple reading, so I gave up. I don't recommend this, but I will say that there are some who would enjoy it. It wasn't my cup of tea, but others might find it more enjoyable."
5,Great Video!,"Had the video now for about a month. Kids favorite. They read along with the book. Ask for it every day. Interaction with the kids tops. Songs are catchy and the kids know all the words by now. They act out each scene in the video. My kids have seen this movie just about every day this month, and still ask for it. If you're going to show only one video a day, this is the one."
3,Characters and Action make this work,"Elizabeth Moon's strengths are characters and action. In Against the Odds, she brings both together and gives us a nice adventure. Certainly she has brought her characters a long way over the course of this series.Occasionally, I found the speechifying of several of the characters to slow the narative. Although fully in context, I think we could have done with a little less of this. Also, while it seems to be the style these days to jump around amongst widely spread characters, narative threads, and physical location, I think Moon detracts from, rather than increases, the story's momemtum by relying on this device so much.Moon is a compelling writer and AGAINST THE ODDS is certainly worth the reading. Given the chance, it should be read after CHANGE OF COMMAND although it can certainly stand on its own."
5,Even good on older truck!!!,My husband and I bought this tent for a '65 dodge truck. We were leary that it would work on such an older truck. We were pleasently suprised at the results.
2,Pretty thin and mostly common sense,"This book is designed to be graphically catchy and has a compelling title. It doesn't really add any substantive ideas to the experience of someone who has already gone through the writing and submission process. I don't need someone to discuss sexual etiquette at writers' conferences or what type of Christmas greeting to send to my peers and business contacts. It might be fine for some recent college graduate or someone without any real world experience but if you have done the classes, attended the conferences, had a limited amount of success with free lance material and have been rejected countless times you already know just about everything printed here. Just not worth the money, period."
4,A great CD by my favourite celtic music group,"Castellum Honesti is surely a geat Cd, worth being bought. Maybe if you're looking for celtic music, you won't expect anyone to say, as I do, that this is my favourite celtic music group (and I have a lot of Irish, Scottish, Welsh or Breton CD's), but it is (maybe you should know that Galicia, in north-west Spain, is as green and foggy as Ireland, that bagpipe is the national instrument there, and that Milladoiro, whose members have a very solid background in folk and medieval music, plays delightfully melancholic songs -as well as some joyous tradicional dance songs-)I would also recommend you to buy other Milladoiro CD's that I enjoy even better, as Galicia de Maeloc, Galicia no Pais das Maravillas or Solfafria - but any of their CD's is a sure buy."
4,Not just for younger readers,"Again another hardback book for the series and I enjoyed the characters, plot and action...good for all ages, but for those who remember the series, a welcome."
1,Pretty but cheap,Photo is better than the product; the cheap beads chafed my neck. The seller was very professional and quick responding with a full refund.
5,Outstanding piece of work,"This movie is one of those films that make you think, as opposed to something like ""Dracula 2000,"" which turned out to be one of the worst movies John Carpenter has ever made. Strangely enough, it explores an area of the psyche which Dracula's story has always exploited, the wish that we all have to be something more than what we are, immortal, powerful, to find out that we have something in us that nobody else has and which makes us something more than anyone else. The ending is totally unexpected, but it makes perfect sense. If you have ever found yourself totally immersed in the kind of stories that classic villain vs hero comic books used to explore (and I say used because what I see now in comic books is not what I saw when I was a kid), this is a movie that you will thoroughly enjoy."
3,Only for the cerebral,"This is a movie that makes you think and takes a different angle on suspense. It may seem slow moving at times but it is the eeriness that made me enjoy this movie. You can think of it as a first issue of a comic where the main character is just realizing his special qualities. If you appreciate good movie making, cinematography, and sound design you'll enjoy this movie."
1,Disappointed,"My wife purchased a couple of DVDs, this being one of them. She failed to notice that this was coming from Great Britain and that it would not play on US DVD players. For those that are technically challenged, the formats are different depending upon certain regions of the world. It's important to never purchase a DVD from off shore. On the other side, sellers that are selling into the US from Europe are intentionally ripping you off. They are very well aware that their product is not compatible with our equipment and they are relying on you not knowing this. Buyer beware."
3,"Interesting but,,,. This looks like sixth sence,,.","I saw this movie after seeing the sixth sence. So I could not be excited. I could foresee the ending.But I could enjoy the special atmospher.If you do not see the sixth sence, you can enjoy this naturally.Thank you."
3,"Good acting, bad movie","Although both Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson worked very well opposite each other in this strange story, I just couldn't seem to sick back and enjoy it. The cinematography made the movie confusing, as it bounced back and forth between reality and another dimension. Samuel L. Jackson played a fantasticly spooky character, but the story itself wasn't put together well, and Bruce Willis, although a fine actor, didn't have the ""something special"" that made The Sixth Sense brilliant. Rent this if you must, but don't buy it - you won't want to see it more than once."
4,Good Movie,"I just love M Night Shyamalan's movies. They keep you spellbound and that is exactly what ""Unbreakable"" does. I would recommend this movie to everyone who likes to sit on the edge of their seat."
4,It's Either Unbreakable or like glass....,"Well, we all know that ""The Sixth Sense"" was a huge hit and boosted M. Night Shyamalan into the director's world. But what most of us did not know was whether or not his next movie, ""UNBREAKABLE"" would be a hit. In my eyes it was but I went and saw the movie with my dad and he disagreed. I did find the plot to move a bit slowly to develop, but this is part of a trilogy and it takes time to develop the first film of a trilogy so I will let that slide. If you go to see this movie you will either love it or hate it. Personally I loved it and I thought Willis and Jackson worked really well together once again (DIE HARD 3). Now most people thought the ending was a little weak, but I on the other hand thought it to be clever and surprising. It had a nice little twist to it. So I would go see the movie and if you like it sign up on Amazon to be notified when it will be released because if you like it, you'll love it and then you'll need to own it."
2,"great potential, poor realization","This movie is a great disappointment. With interesting plot and deep philosophical message, it could have been a great movie. Unfortunately for the viewer, this promising set up has been turned into a boring crimi with unclear purpose. On top of everything, both main actors' performance (B. Willis and S.L. Jackson) fell behind their usual qualities. Avoid this one unless you are a diehard fan of one of the two main actors!"
4,Tough act to follow,"Well, if you are expecting another ""Sixth Sense"" you will be very dissapointed. Not because I think that this is a dissapointing movie, but because it does not fall into the bin of ""mainstream"" entertainment. I can see why people would hate it. When I saw it in the movie theater, I got a quick look around at the faces of other people, and I saw some pretty bored, angry faces. But I loved it. My friends loved it. I think that the much-debated slow pace is essential in developing the tension, climax, and resolution. The plot and the angle in which the director took to develop it is genius. I found this movie to be thought-provoking and facinating. If M. Night Shyamalan goes to a more pop-culture style, I believe this movie loses all of its effectiveness. If you want to me to classify ""Unbreakable"", I really can't. This is not a horror movie, this is not an action movie, this is not a psychological thriller. This is simply a great movie. Open your mind and enjoy."
5,Greatest Comic Mythology film ever made,This is M Night's best film in my opinion. It is the most grounded in reality and also the most emotional. I feel this film is way overlooked and misunderstood by most people. Thankfully someone in Blu Ray heaven loves it as much as I do. A great film gets is place on blu ray!
5,An update of the constant struggle between good and evil..,"This movie in my opinion was the best movie of 2000. Unbreakable is an amazing movie and I am not surprised at all that many people didn't like it. Alot of people wanted to see ""Sixth Sense 2"" but this is a completely different animal. It is the age old story of good and evil, and of a hero coming to terms with who he is. This movie makes me feel good because it shows that there can be a hero in all of us if we just reach our potential. 5 out of 5 stars."
2,Hunh?!?!?,"After seeing 6th Sense, I was eagerly awaiting Shaymelan's follow up. Ohhhhhhhhhhhh...kaaayyyyyy.I would say that this is a love it or hate it movie. I hated it, but I know several people who loved it. Willis, again, manages his role with the skill you'd expect. Jackson...all I can say is 'Is there ANYTHING this man can't do. The acting is fine. But the story is a head scratcher. I've heard that, if you are familliar with Comic Books, this is a great film. I'm not, so it explains it for me, at least.I put this in the category of Chinese Dinner films. I know I've just seen a film...just don't feel like I've seen a film."
1,The movie is unbreakable - but the DVD IS breakable!,"This movie had a good story line, but was not worthy of a 2 hour movie. This story line would have made a good Outer Limits type show. Very slow, and the best part is the last 15 minutes. Also, some of the best scenes can only be found in the deleted scenes section!"
1,A film like this should get negative stars!,The film was extremely slow and I kept waiting for the story (that I though existed) to start but half way through I gave up and realized I was out of luck. All I'm going to say is that this film is too tiresome to watch and I wish I could go back in time to retrieve the time I waisted watching it.
3,Out with a Fizzle,"Like many other watchers, I found the movie to have alot of promise only to provide a very, very, poor ending."
2,unbreakable,this movie was so policial crap i wouldnt watch it again if you paid me . wh yowuld someone never get hurt and be good but one who suffer all the time be bad .
2,Could have been alot better.,"I don't recomend you to buy this movie,because it's not nearly as great as i thought it would have been..The plot it's about a man named David Dunnes(played by Bruce Willis) that survived on a train accident and didn't suffered even one scratch,he's a security guard and he's too strong even for a human been,he's sobrenatural and prodigious!besides that,he was the only survivant from the accident.He also meets a man called Elijah(played by Samuel L.Jackson) that it's the exact oppost of dunnes,he was born crippled,and will change David Dunne's life forever!As you can see,the plot offers something new,fresh and interesting,and the cast it's pretty good,featuring very well known stars such as Bruce Willis,Samuel L. Jackson and Robin Wright Penn.The director is also pretty good .A very good concept movie,but very frankly,the results could have been better.I didn't even see all the movie."
2,dirge,"not much to say about this movie. i've had a copy on videotape for about 5 years and haven't managed to get through the entire movie yet. once a year i go back and start at the beginning, but after about 40 minutes, it always the same for me: ""god, this is so slow and boring ... when is something, anything, going to happen ??"" then i switch off the vcr and tv and go and do something less boring instead (like watch grass grow).don't get this movie unless you are extremely patient."
3,"It was almost great, but then it ruined itself.","The movie was great for almost the whole thing. Samual L. Jackson's charcter was viewed by me as someone with a troubled life, who comes with a troubled vantage-point. However, when he was right all along, that was just to much. If it wasn't for the deep comic book connection, the movie would have been a definate 5 stars. Unfortunetly, the ending drops it down to 3. -The Darin!!"
5,Awesome!,"M. Night Shyamalan is the master!This movie is excellent! As every M. Night movie is.Great characters, great acting and a unusual, never been done before story!Never pass up the chance to see a M. Night Shyamalan classic!"
2,"""I SEE COMIC BOOK HEROES""","After M. Night Shyamalan's huge hit ""The Sixth Sense,"" he could do anything he wanted. What he chose was an earlier story idea he had that is essentially a reworking of basic plot elements of his previous smash.""UNBREAKABLE"" springs from a flimsy premise about comic book heroes existing in real life. It's a dark, grim, but sometimes absorbing metaphysical mystery about an ordinary blue collar guy, Bruce Willis again, who encounters himself and his nemesis (Samuel L. Jackson) as he attempts to restore his troubled marriage and maintain a bond with his sometimes nutty kid (who wants to shoot him to see if he's really an ""unbreakable"" superhero).The sumptuous two disc set includes an unusually muted widescreen transfer with a rich but repetitive sound design. A ton of extras including ""Comic Books and Superheroes"" with Jackson. Nice fold-out packaging but disappointing content. Rent before you buy."
4,Prett good movie.,"So if you don't know about the movie yet, it's like a comic book story that M. Night Shalayaman did. It's not a collector type of movie but an enjoyable one, something to see with a boy/son together. Bruce Willis and Samual Jackson are on opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to natural strength. Samual realized early in life how weak he is and started looking for the other person on the spectrum. Through ""research"", he found out that Bruce is the guy. He tries to convince Bruce that he is something all the while Bruce does not believe him. After some coaxing from his son and Samual, Bruce begins to believe it and goes about finding out how much he can really do.It's worth a rental for sure and maybe up to $7 purchase."
2,"self-indulgent, embarassing nonsense","A terrible film. Nice photography though. If you can manage to stay awake. Not worth a rental. I found myself admiring the aesthetic qualities of the bookself next to the TV. Stupid, stupid plot. Not worth watching to see how stupid the plot is. An attempt to have a surprise ending. Don't bother.Is this a worse movie than Gladiator? Of course not, but it's not a whole lot better. Just bad in a completely different way. Hence the two stars."
1,WARNING,Many friends warned me before watching this movie! But I didn't listen... now I regret it!This movie is very weak and boring. I cannot imagine the same director and writer of Sexth Sense directed and wrote this movie!The movie failed because:1. The dialoge was EXTREMELY terrible.2. The acting job was no special.3. Lack of suspense and surprises.4. The wife and kid characters were terribly shallow and weak.5. The events were very slow and boring.6. The overall story is silly.7. The director is to blame for so many weak points all through the movie.8. The settings and interaction between the main characters was weak.The ending was a bit surprising but after being bored all through the movie you won't care or be impressed with it.Don't say you haven't been WARNED! This movie has nothing to do with the PERFECTION of Sixth Sense.
2,Twisty? or predictable?,"When Unbreakable first came out, everyone was talking about the twist ending. I think it was Entertainment Weekly that said the mere mention of a twist ending ruined the ending altogether. I would have to agree. From the moment I started watching the movie I began to speculate about the end. When one thinks about it for a while it was easy to figure out. Maybe it wasn't as good as the Sixth Sense (which the ending was ruined for me) but I didn't really like the Sixth Sense as much as the rest of the world did anyway. So it was really a let down but we'll see what happens with this summer's Signs, maybe, hopefully, it will be better."
2,Unbreakable,"I was struck watching this film by the old fable about the emporer's new clothes. As a big fan of ""The Sixth Sense"", it was shocking to sit through this overly long rehash of someone's juvenile fantasies filmed in too dark, out-of-focus cinema techniques. Someone, somewhere along the way, should have told the young boy genius director that this was bad, bad, bad. Willis and Jackson and the rest of the cast are a talented lot, but not even they could save this poor dog."
5,A Movie With A Quiet Intensity,"Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson star in this movie, and M. Night Shyamalan is the director and filmaker. I love Shyamalan's work, and also recommend The Sixth Sense, which he also wrote. This movie may not be better than The Sixth Sense, but it is better than The Village and Signs (also by Shyamalan). It quietly advances leaving you wondering where the impact is going to be, then you see it and it is significant, interesting, and sometimes intense. If you watch with a careful eye, you will get the most out of this film. Be patient; you are in for a whammy of an ending."
5,Unbreakable (2000),"This movie is the best sci-fi drama I've ever seen. M. Night Shamalan does it again with such great direction and an original story line. The story is basically about a guy who soon finds out that he may possess human powers and his ordeals coping with it. Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson deliver very powerful performances, so it's impossible to take your eyes off the screen. Like Shamalan's other films this one leaves you in suspense throughout the entire film, and has a surprise ending."
2,"Good, but not great","I just saw this movie yesterday. I went into it in a really excited mood, but as I sat there I felt somewhat bored throughout most of the movie. There were a number of good scenes, but many of them felt somewhat awkward; for example, during a certain scene with a gun the theatre was laughing. I felt that it was supposed to be dramatic, but it came off as comedic. I also felt that the kid in the movie was trying far too much to be the kid from the Sixth Sense. But, there was some gold amid the lead. The ending was extremely powerful, it seems that the director has a knack for those suprise endings. Unfortunately, this isn't enough to make up for the slow pace and unbelievablility of the rest of it. I still don't understand why the drugs weren't in that guy's pockets?This movie might be good to rent, but I'd skip the $5-8 and long (though probably not for long) lines that it would cost to see it in the theatres."
1,"Terrible, slow and a waste of time","SLOW SLOW SLOW, that is how i would describe this movie. Confusing. This has to be the worse movie i have ever seen. I can not find a person in my life that has liked it. dont waste your time or money on it. Just my opinion"
3,Bhutto: 1953-2007,"This book is a very simple and basic book about Benazir Bhutto, the assassinated former (and, for a while, hoped-for-future) Prime Minister. She was the first female Prime Minister of any Muslim nation, and the Pakistani equivalent in many ways of Indira Gandhi, including, unfortunately, the manner of her death.This book does not give much insight into the various controversies and scandals of Bhutto's life -- being written more as a school-book variety biography, it gives basic facts about Pakistan, about Bhutto's family and her own life, and gives a few bits and pieces of her own quo0tes and writing. Unfortunately, there aren't many books available on Bhutto (and somewhat ironically, there is an upcoming autobiography due to be released in April 2008).One would do just as well at the moment to scan the various internet sources for information about Bhutto, but for younger people who should remember this person, who in many ways was inspiring and hope-ful, it could be worthwhile."
2,Almost Worthless,"As other posts have noted, this is not the Ace hard rubber unbreakable comb of old. After barely two weeks in a back pocket one end broke off and after a few more days the teeth are bending into unusable shapes. I gave it two stars only because I have been unable to find another fine tooth comb without sharp pointed teeth.If anyone has found a durable pocket comb, please reply."
2,"Excellent, but also short lived worthless junk.",This comb is excellent for three days. One end broke off the fourth day and teeth began bending and breaking soon after.
3,Need a little tweak,"This bracket is heavy duty which I give 5 stars, but the holes are little off on all my three equipment. My choice is to skip one hole in between equipment to make the hole perfectly aligned, but you can only put 3 equipment on this spacing instead of four. When using the bracket for 4 equipment I have to make my equipment mount holes a little larger to make the bracket hole aligned to my equipment mount holes, so I give that 3 stars for the tweak. Another way is to drill out a larger hole on the original bracket and buy a pair of screws with rack clip on the nuts build in to eliminate the original tapped holes. Note that the edges of this bracket are sharp and can scratch your table easily."
5,Very nice book.,"Love this book, So much history, So beautiful buildings this was before the Ugly buildings were and are being made, the hideous mega skyscrapers and towers that now dot downtown miami that you cannot even see the sun. This was development without the crazy ideas."
3,Bobby V- Bobby Valentino Review,"3 Stars (with intro, outro, inter, and skits counted)/4 Stars (when only counting rating from songs)5 Stars- Track 24 Stars- Tracks 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 173 Stars- Tracks 7, 9, 12, 13, 142 Stars- Track 151 Star- Tracks 1, 5, 11, 16This album was straight. It could have been a four star album but the two interludes, intro, and outro brought it down. Most interludes, intros and outros automatically get a one star rating with me. The only song I don't really care to hear again was Track 15-One Girl To Love. I think that this rating could possibly improve with a few more listens, some of the four star ratings have potential to become favorites, and a few of the three star ratings could move to four. Of course Track 2-Slow Down got a five star rating and is my favorite track from the album. Decent CD just needs a few more listens."
1,Most of it is missing!,This tape was made from a TELEVISION release of the film. For that reason all of the nudity and much of the story have been cut. This is a FUN movie when it is all in one piece. Let's hope somebody releases a full version one of these days!
3,'Til Death Do Us Part? Not for poor Alan.,When Lord Alan Cunningham's wife dies he takes to luring beautiful women who resemble her to his castle and gruesomely murdering them. It's the only thing that helps him feel sane! Ah but then he meets Gladys and his life changes. Now he really IS sane. At least until he starts to think his dead wife has come back from the dead!
5,A masterpiece from THE talking head,"This David Byrne CD is superb. It's one of about 10 CDs that are always in my rotation of music at home. David Byrne and Talking Heads have been more about rock-solid rhythm than blazing guitar solos, vocal hooks, or other common tricks in the book. Rei Momo is a rhythmic masterpiece, featuring a number of styles that are drawn from South America. At first, I was taken aback by the fact that all of the vocals were in English, but DB's vocal style fits the music like a glove. Listen to some of the lyrics - e.g., on Independence Day and you can almost see David smiling while singing. To me, the arrangements are what stands out and if you like drums, percussion, and horns all combined to give you a driving, grinding dance rhythm, then this CD is for you. Listen to the horns on Dirty Old Town - wow, an amazing arrangement. This CD will put a smile on your face and a bounce in your step."
1,Disrespect!,"Byrne's CD is an example of what not to do when playing samba. It's probably ok with salsa, merengue or other caribean rythm as long as I don't know most of them, but it is not samba for sure! It's indeed a disrespect with all composers who try to create samba music seriously, wich is very far away of Byrne's songs. The impression ""Rei Momo"" caused me is that Byrne put together all latin american rythms he heard about, without studying them deeply. And the title of the CD is completely out of point. Rei Momo is one of the most traditional characters of Brazilian carnival and specific of samba music. It just don't have anything to do with the type of music Byrne has done."
4,"Nice, easy read","This book is just a cute little book definately from a time gone by. Easier read than a Lamour, but still a pretty solid western, even by today's standards."
4,"Good Game, kinda short","I liked this game, but thought it was kind of short. Good graphics, except in one of the night vision modes which in it makes it difficult to see anything. Doesn't take a whole lot to get yourself killed in this game, a few hits and your done for. There are a lot better combat games out there, but this one is pretty good. I think it is worth buying."
2,"No split-screen co-op mode, sluggish single player... semi-auto?","My daughter and I were really jazzed about this and then there was no split-screen co-op mode. The original, Jungle Storm and Rainbow Six 3 all have a two player, local-only mode so we were expecting one. No joy.We say, ""Ok, so single-player and take turns! No problem."". Maybe we have been playing super-sneaky Rainbow Six too much, but not being able to crouch, corner peek is rotten. In fact all the input feel sluggish, slow, lagging and loose. Not a fun game.This last gripe is probably my fault and I haven't investigated it any. The rifle is semi-auto. This should be a military issue assault rifle w/ full auto and maybe optionally burst. Even if there is a select fire toggle, why default to semi-auto? I think i saw it flash on screen, but could not make it happen.Maybe the game will grow on me like Rainbow Six, but I am doubtful."
2,"Nice try, but I'm keeping your cigar","All right, it was curiosity that impelled me to buy this set without attempting to get a listen first. What Bach-lover wouldn't want another worthy Passion to add to his collection, even the reconstruction of a long-lost score? Well, maybe one day, but this recording is certainly not it!This St. Mark reconstruction doesn't really even sound like Bach to me, even in the recitatives whose authenticity Mr. Koopman claims were the result of years of playing the real thing. And very unfortunately, the bulk of the recording consists of recitatives, though I've not timed them; perhaps it just seems that way. The arias and choruses, though based on other Bach works, do not inspire me. Granted, the gauge by which I judge poor Mr. Koopman is perhaps the greatest composer who has yet lived. Still, it was Vater Bach who provided the basis and framework for Mr. Koopman's success or failure; with such a leg up, I expected more!... and so I vote with a mere two."
3,Challenging reading,"Well-written from a scholarly viewpoint, this book is otherwise a challenging read with its pedantic style."
1,Very disappointing,"The ""book"" turns out to be a very small booklet with some brief historical content on Northern Thailand that is written as a rather boring history professor would write it. I can't beleive I was suckered into buying a booklet for 10 dollars. When they say brief...they really mean brief....buyer beware"
2,Lacks objectivity...,"Previous experience using another of Carol Anthony's I Ching commentaries raised my expectations for this much-expanded volume. The reality was disappointing, at best. The commentary is rife with authorial bias, coloring the commentary to a degree frustrating to one accustomed to the liberty of application of a more neutral approach."
2,not for me,"When I discovered the first sentence of the introduction to be written in poor English grammar, i did not give the rest of the book much perusal. I returned it for full refund."
