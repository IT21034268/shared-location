2,not for a 'tough chomper',"the toy itself is good...easy to throw and my dog had a lot of fun using it for fetch. however, once he settled down and started chewing on it, it took him all of 30 seconds (literally) to find the seam and open it up. and that was all she wrote! now, granted, our dog will find the seam on any toy and destroy it, but i thought this one would last just a little longer then it did. like i said though, for fetch and tug-of-war, its great!"
1,Avoid these if you want a quality sound.,"Definitely too much tremble and not enough bass. If feels like there too much distance from the ears to the sound. I can get a good sound only by taking the foam covers off. Look elsewhere, or pay more, for a better pair."
2,You get what you paid for!,These Sonys are possibly the worst quality headphones I have ever purchased in the $20 to $25 price range. You can't hear any bass and they distort at a relatively low volume. I give them 2 stars for the foldable design.
2,dannys opinions,"it is nice to have tab, with the notation. there is no indication as to which version of the tunes he is trancribing , the title is a lie there is no breakdown of the guitar style there just tunes trincribed period."
5,The Strunk and White of Portuguese,"I just received this book the other day, and it is a gem. I have gone through many Portuguese and Spanish grammar books in my time and discarded most as cumbersome and unusable. This is by far the most concise, clear book of this type I have ever seen. Between the Portuguese audio course I am working through and this book, I am there! It is the Strunk and White of Portuguese and a whole lot more."
3,Gives you a solid foundation but not an easy read,"While ""Essential Portuguese Grammar"" gives learners of the language a solid review of grammar and serves as a handy ""reference guide,"" for self-learners who are trying to grasp the language on their own, it is not well suited to beginners and is not meant to be an all-encompassing way to learn the language.It's a great book for highly motivated self-learners or as a supplement to more substantive texts/audio books."
2,This book is quite worthless,"Priscilla Y. Huff gives you practical advice on how to work from home and take care of your family. But if you were a degreed professional prior to being a mom, this is not the book for you. But according to the book, you should pursue a home business in candlemaking or crafts. But this is the 2000's, not the 1950's, Priscilla! Many of young professionals are educated in far different arenas than were portrayed here! And I also agree with a reader from Illinois: If you already have the credentials to run your own home health agency, you don't need this book to suggest it. And if you don't this suggestion is worthless.Take my advice, ladies, do not buy this book. There are a lot of the generic home-based business books; with the careers outlined in them, you might actually have the opportunity to make a great home business."
4,Some Rather Good Covers By Hammond!,"John Hammond picks up where he left off on his last CD ""Wicked Grin"" with more Tom Wait sounding vocals and hypnotic rhythms. In fact, Hammond covers two more Wait tunes, ""Gin Soaked Boy"" and ""Low Slide Off The Road"". Hammond also manages to cover two Wait sounding tunes written by David Hildago of Los Lobos's for his blues side project ""Houndog"". The two tunes are ""No Chance"" and ""I Brought The Rain"". Throw in a little country, ""Easy Living"" a little Willie Dixon, ""Same Thing"", Mick Jagger's ""Spider and the Fly"", one original ""Slick Crown Vic"" and some odds and ends and you have another Hammond success. While I enjoy this CD as well as 2001's ""Wicked Grin"", I do prefer to hear the Hammond originals. ""Slick Crown Vic"" shows he still has the knack for writing clever lyrics and memorable hooks but one song in two albums is not enough."
4,OneHorse,"Glasses are nice and hardy just as expected; however, I discovered that I could have purchased them locally at a much lower cost. I hate to shop, so my feeling is that this is the price I sometimes pay for convenience."
2,Too tall,I strongly recomment measuring your shelves before ordering this item. Glasses were too tall for my cabinet shelves. One arrived broken.
5,Trailboss,"I am an avid reader, although not much of what I read is Western Romance. This book is one that has changed my outlook on what I read. I couldn't put this book down until every page was read."
4,movies that make you laugh,"I DON'T INTEND TO GIVE YOU A SCENE AFTER SCENE REVIEW OF THESECOMEDY'S WE HAVE ALL SEEN THEM BEFORE COUNTLESS TIMES, I AM NOTINTERESTED IN PEOPLES LIKES OR DISLIKES REGARDING CONTENT, ALLI WANT TO KNOW IS WHETHER THE DVD QUALITY IS BETTER THAN THEVHS OR LASER DISC VERSIONS AND IF THE SOUND QUALITY HAS BEENIMPROVED, DOES THE DVD HAVE CHAPTERS? ECT, AS FOR THESE RELEASESWARNERS HAVE DELIVERED THE GOODS RE DVD QUALITY IN BOTH PICTUREAND SOUND, IF YOU WANT TO BRIGHTEN YOUR DAY, AND HAVE A LAUGHBUY THESE MARX BROS DVD'S WITH CONFIDENCE THAT THEY WILL DELIVER"
5,The best explanation of how the voice works,"Mr. Brown has written a powerfully informative book about all aspects of the voice. His book provides many interesting case studies, is very enjoyable to read, and includes factoids like ""the Western and European singing style uses a low larynx."" My one gripe is that the CD is not usable as a practice aid. Every exercise is demonstrated so briefly that you won't get a warm-up at all after singing along. If you don't have a piano, and you want to practice vocalizing at home with a piano recorded on a CD and exercises that methodically start on consecutive pitches, try the Jeffrey Allen book/CD set. That set includes techniques such as messa di voce, also demonstrated (more briefly) in Mr. Brown's CD."
2,Fancy watch but not good as a dive computer,"Kind of disappointed. Purchase D6 year ago, use only on few dives, very conservative dive computer, protective plastic from the right side fell off and when I visit local dive shop and ask, sales girl have the same watch with same problem and lost screw. After I call suunto, I was told that repair gone take 3-4week and I decide to don't even bother with repair and use my old dive rite computer for diving I was using for the last 10 years."
4,Great introduction to mac programming,"language independant Dan takes you step by step into the hardest programming platform, Macintosh...where the programmer does the work, not the user."
2,"The beeps, the beeps! Aaaarrrrgh!","This monitor is crystal clear, yes. But, after almost 4 months of working flawlessly, my monitor started beeping today at 3am. It happened three times, too! I thought I would go into cardiac arrest the stinkin' thing was so loud.I'm going to try to get a replacement child unit from the company, but I'm not expecting much to change... <sigh>... gotta find another monitor, I suppose."
4,Great Range but too much Static,"The range and size of the product is great, as is the fact that it comes with one set of recharagable batteries. We returned it, however, because we receved too much interference on the unit. I don't think this is a design flaw, but is probably standard electromagnetic interference. We have a pair of 2.4 Ghz phones, as well as a wireless router, and I suspect these are interfering with the reception.If you don't have 2.4 Ghz electronics in your house, this should be fine. If you do, you may want to consider a different product."
1,Aweful!,"I ABSOLUTELY HATE THIS MONITOR!IT HAS STATIC ALL THE TIME!!- THE LIGHTS FLASH ALL THE TIME-ITDRIVES ME CRAZY! I can't find any reason for it to be doing this, and the reception light is completely green. I have triedit everywhere in our bedroom. My daughter is one and I can't take it anymore- I am breaking down and getting a different monitor!!There are days when it works fine, but most of the time it just flashes and buzzes..Argh!!!Don't waste your money!!"
1,Zero for two,I bought two of these locally... neither worked. The first one wouldn't charge up the batteries... the second had HORRIBLE reception! I had to shout into it and all I could hear was static.For an expensive monitor... they should have better QC in China.
3,It Beeps for NO reason!!!!,We've had this monitor since our son was born 10 months ago. All and all it's a great monitor - except - it randomly beeps as if someone has pressed the locator button.
2,Too good to be true?,"Unfortunately, yes. I was swayed heavily by the raves written by other reviewers prior to ordering this fan. After a week of living comfortably with it, I was confident enough to toss the packaging out. This turned out to be premature....the fan soon developed an annoying problem. The blade will not rotate unless you start it on 'medium' or 'high' speed. After it runs for a few minutes, you can cut it back to 'low'. I am very disappointed in this development and if I still had the box, it'd be on its way back to Hunter as soon as the weather cools off. Also, being a 'fan' of American-made products, I was also chargrined to find out that, despite the nostalgic tone and 'family pride' found on the packaging, this fan is made in China!"
2,Poor Design,"This fan serves it's purpose I guess...until you need to take off the front panel. It took me a while to figure it all out. Plus, the reason I needed to take it off was because when I first received it and tried to turn it on, the blades were stuck on the front cover."
3,Well built but definitely not 5 star,"All exposed parts are metal and the fan seems to be solid. The switches function smoothly like a quality product. For all practical purposes the noise from the fan is not much different than other fans. Two jets flying overhead is not much different than one jet flying overhead in terms of their effect on your life. If you want to direct the air from the fan toward the ceiling or to move air up a stairwell, this is not the fan for you. It has VERY limited elevation adjustment. The fan can be set to remain stable or oscillate over an 85 degree range. There is no intermediate setting."
5,The best! Loveible! Again the best!,"I love her and named her Caramel! Best toy! But I want to talk about the website. It is the best part! You cangive your pet any tipe of room. Fish have under water rooms and they HAVE to! Bet any floor or wall. The birds are worst. They have tree top rooms and HAVE to. They can not have a floor or wall. But any furniture. [At least I think so. May have to have tree top furniture.] But any ways, Dogs and other land animals can have any tipe. Caramel has a big fan room. They even have make believe animals! So, really, I like any webkin!"
5,Essential in any physicist bookshelf,"This book is the basis of Quantum Mech any physicist that respect him or herself should read Dirac because it resembles the origins and gives the best description of QM there can be in this book you can feel the real possibilities of QM I say possibilities because at the time QM wasn't fully developed, or at least as thought through as it is now.Either way this is a basic book for anyone intending to study physics I really recommend it.One thing you should know is that the image given here is the not the real one, you should look at th one given by me, is one taken from the look inside, that has the real cover. But as it is always said you should never judge a book by its cover, even more so if the one who wrote it was the best physicist in the last century."
2,Highly (over)rated ?,"This is not a review as such, I just want to say I completely agree with the reader from Israel. Although a ""classic"" in the historical sense, I think the legendary status of this book much overdone. Nowadays there are MANY better QM texts out there from any angle and at any level."
1,Propaganda,"This is not a scientific or reasonable book. It is propaganda, plain and simple. The fallacious arguments put forth in this book are hardly worth refuting if you have any actual understanding of the science of evolutionary biology, but for the average, non-scientific individual this book pulls out every dirty bit of sleight of hand there is to convince them of it's message: evolution is evil and atheistic, creation is the only answer.They misquote people, misrepresent evidence, quote quacks and frauds, play games with probabilities, claim that scientists ""don't know"" things that have been known for decades, and do an awful lot of hand-waving to distract the reader from the fact that they are not making any sense.A horrific crime against reason and dignity. The Watchtower Society should be ashamed of themselves for publishing this book."
1,David Diamond,"I believe the biography is not the real source of information about the composer. The description of his personality doesn't really match the person, and I wouldn't suggest reading the book. Mr. Diamond wrote an autobilgraphy himself, and it will be published in the near future, edited by Mr. Paris.Regards, Brett Diamond, composer, NYC"
5,Fantastic Soundtrack!! Great Remaster!!,"This is really a remarkable soundtrack and the remastered sound is phenomenal!! To me this is where the music for the James Bond movies really began to take shape. There are themes developed here that have continued throughout the series of films. Great stuff, highly recommend!"
3,Take a trip Down Desperation Lane,"Not exactly an uplifting movie, though there are a few great musical moments in Robin Trower and Blue Oyster Cult songs. This movie plays out the nightmarish scenario dreaded by all near-do-wells, coming home a failure. Other subject lines within the film include unrealized dreams, excessive drug usage and aging.But actor ( ) cast as Jimmy Testagross delivers as the one-time roadie who's lost his job."
5,Best recording of the Mozart piano sonatas,"It's such a shame this disc is out of print. The interpretations of the sonatas are sublime. They are the ones I return to. The Walter Klien recordings are a close second. Horszowski sets a high standard--not Romantic (as Perahia tends to be with Mozart) but not cold either. The interpretations are sensitive, subtle, and intelligent."
4,Terrific viewing,"A WWII historical drama/romance well worth watching. Shows the unbelievable horror of one of the worst outrages of the war.The firebombing scenes are incredibly realistic, horrifying and heart-rending, and in a strange way beautiful. The flight sequences ditto.The characters are excellent as are their portrayals. Even in the midst of war and pain, there are venal characters doing their worst. And there are gallant and humane characters doing theirs.Don't miss this one. Can't wait until it is formatted for our region so I can buy it and watch again."
2,Don't you hate when your city is firebombed when you are trying to get some nuggie?,DRESDEN--The German miniseries about the infamous bombing in 1945 was surprisingly disapointing with an over long and involved forbidden romance between a good german girl and a shot down British bomber pilot and even more surprisingly unimpressive Dresden Bombing and firestorm. It is like they spent all the money on the love glop and ran out just when the bombs started to drop.
3,Falls apart at the end. So does Dresden.,"It does a good job of presenting the history without grinding any axes. And if you've ever wondered what exactly Hogans Heroes were doing over Germany when they got shot down, as I used to, now you'll know . The special effects are pretty damn believable, at least to me who have never seen a city fire bombed. But the love story part is a disaster. Maybe it would have taken a 3rd disk and another 100 million Euros to develop the romance and make it plausible. Well, it isn't, so best sit back and enjoy, if that's the right word, the spectacle of a beautiful old city being roasted."
5,Elegant Food ---,"""Lemons - A Country Garden Cookbook"" produces wonderful, elegant dishes that everyone compliments. The Lemon meringue pie is the best ever! People loved the Lemon Squares, too. I have made most of the recipes in this book, and all of them were successful."
3,Bessie Head,I already received and this product is very good. I suggest for all people interest in anti-colonizing and politics action
5,"NOT THE CHEAPEST, BUT YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!","Over the past 35 years, we have ordered and used close to 100 of these headphones. We have tried other brands along the way, but returned to Plantronics every time. They last forever, well almost, and when they do have a problem they are easy to order parts for and fix yourself. If you don't feel comfortable fixing them yourself...you can send them in for a cost of around $49 and the unit will be completely refurbished and returned quickly. Cannot beat them."
1,Quickly disintegrated...,"The beginning to middle is quite intriguing and I was enjoying it fairly well... then the plot disintegrated, the scenes became random and lacking in depth and the ending was totally ungratifying. I literally rolled my eyes as the credits ending scrolled - felt like a total waste. The fact that she's 100 years older but a character she met before she fell asleep is only 10 years older is still puzzling me. *sigh*"
5,Stay Young,"An amazing book that helps you strike a balance. This book is much appreciated among women in their mid-life. Dr. Hotze does give us some clear and useful information to remain young with his eight step program. If its depression that you are going thru all you need is to get a copy of Hormones, Health and Happiness.[...]"
3,Cheap,If you are looking for quality this is not it. Overpriced for what you get in my opinion. I wish it was slightly more substantial and less flimsy.
4,A special treat for long-time Walter Hawkins fans...,"After 25 years, Bishop Walter Hawkins proves that the fire of the Holy Spirit is still alive and well in him and in the Love Center Choir. This first of this 2 CD set introduces new tunes by the Love Center Choir which are sure to join the long list of standards and favorites from years and years gone by. In addition, the second disc reuinites members from the original Love Center Choir for joyous covers of some of their best-loved songs. With the exception of some sound problems and a bit of confusion with the song titles as listed in the liner notes, this is an excellent production, well worth adding to any Walter Hawkins collection."
4,Leaf Canister,Arrived on time in good condition. No directions were provided. Figured it out and it is great! Thanks! Erin
4,kids bible,great product only problem is the pages are a bit to tender for the fact that the bible is for kids. need to be careful with the pages. however the bible layout is wonderful and the extra facts are great for even adults my mother and i both agree that it is a must have item in the home. All kids and adults should have one!
4,Early and rare Kapell at his best.,"Anyone who wants to hear some excellent Kapell rarities, mostly taken from broadcast performances, would do well to buy this. A performance of the last two movements of the Beethoven Third Piano Concerto, recorded when Kapell was only 14 (!), shows remarkable maturity of style. His performance of the Mussorgsky ""Pictures,"" recorded at Connecticut College just a few months before his death, is as good, if not better, than the recently released Frick gallery performance, although the sound is somewhat scratchy. The notes by Kapell's widow, Dr. Anna Lou Kapell DeHavenon, give us some excellent insights into the performances and the man himself. Overall, excellent. The only thing that prevented me from giving the recording five stars was the somewhat variable sound quality, but why quibble when you're dealing with performances of this calibre?"
3,One big Seinfeld episode (sort of),"Medicine River had no exciting plot. Not that the book was a bore, it's just that it wasn't going anywhere. One could describe it as one big Seinfeld episode but without as much humor. What confuses me is why the author set out to right this novel - what was the point?"
3,A bit samey,"Well, I loved her other album, including the African rhythmed ones, so a full album of that style has a definite appeal. But each of the songs are just a bit too much alike. And there's only so much ""Eeyayo"" chants I can take before I start getting a bit agitated over unoriginality. However, it's excellent music, especially as background ambience."
2,Pretty good start but doesn't deliver,"I found this book on the shelf of a used bookstore and was immediately intrigued. I identified with the main character of ""The Obituary Writer"", young aspiring journalist Gordie Hatch, following in the footsteps of his father - an accomplished newspaper man whose life and career were cut short. But after the first forty pages the story line turns predictable, the dialog clunky, and the characters fail to develop. Shreve is a talented writer that keeps you turning the pages but the novel never delivers to its potential. The novel is reminiscent of Raymond Chandler and so my hopes were high. In the end I concluded that this was written more as a movie script than a serious novel. It was close, but no cigar."
5,Cool Cool Cool,"This is a great album. Rough around the edges, but with a warm smooth soul. I don't know why the complete tracks arent listed. There are about twice as many songs as the listing indicates. If you are a fan of ska music beyond what you hear on white-boy rock radio, check this guy out. I am so happy to find out that Amazon.com offers this disc. My old tape copy is about to die, so I guess I'll refresh it with a shiny new CD, becuase I just couldn't imagine not having this album in my collection. To my knowledge, Chris plays just about everything on this record. My foavorite touch are the carnivalesque keyboards that add some whimsy and sweetness to the soulful lyrics and groovy rhythms. Just give it a shot. I don't think that you'll be disappointed.michael thomas Washington, DC"
2,"Works, but flimsy","We use these and the newer, solid-boom models at work for taking calls and these Encore ones are total trash. The mic booms easily contort and bend, becoming permanently crimped and making it impossible to pick up your voice. The swivel for the boom loosens with use and eventually will no longer stay where you put it. In addition, the head band is not very strong so during the day your headset slowly slides off your ear due to it's own weight.I suppose if you got one new, were the only user, and babied it when you used it that it would do a good job. I mean, when I am forced to use one at work (because the new ones are all being used) I still get my job done, but it isn't comfortable or convenient. At all."
5,DURO-MED THERABEADS NECK PAIN RELIEF PACK,"Recently had to go to physical therapy and they used a similar pack for my neck pain, so I saw this and wanted to try it at home."
2,"Great subject, poor execution.","I really, really wanted to enjoy this book. However, the writing is about what you would expect from two students (who remarkably resemble Mrs. Levy) who took a writing course because they had nothing better to do. They decided to make the end-product of their course this biography.I love New Orleans, I live uptown, and ""Confederacy"" is one of my favorite books. Alas, this book does give good information (typically in the form of correspondence from Mr. Toole) about John Kennedy Toole, but the execution is stunted.Try ""Ken and Thelma"" for a much better look into Mr. Toole's life."
2,Frame too small for License Plate,"I love the look of the license plate holder, but it is too mall to hold the license plate. The plate stuck over the side walls of the holder and made it difficult to attach to the car."
3,"Service and price excellent, condition of book excellent","I rate this transaction a 3 star although the price, service and condition of product was excellent. The contents of book was disappointing to me in that it was illustrated in black and white. This isn't a reflection on the seller, seller's service and price and description of condition right on the mark. Seller gets a 5 star, product itself gets a two star."
4,An old friend repurchased,"Years ago I had the vinyl version of this recording, but--like many other albums I wish I'd held on to--I disposed of it when records went out. While some of the songs on this album aren't my favorites, I still find it very inspirational in a Chet Atkins kind of way. (I wouldn't compare this with Twin Sisters, for example.) Several of the selections are pretty rather than jazzed up, and those are my favorites. I'm just glad to have this album back again. Also recommended: Chet Atkins Picks on the Beatles."
5,Good start to staying safe online,"I don't know what happened to my other review, but I have to say this first edition of the book is a good start to staying safe online. However, get the new 2nd edition - it's chock full of new information and 100 more pages of things not covered in this edition."
3,Staple Reference Book,"This is a great reference book- kind of like the wading pool of issues surrounding the war on drugs. It's thought-provoking and informative, the notes are easy to follow making this book an essential educational weapon in any advocates arsenal but if you really want to know- to feel ""Why marijuana should be legal"" read ""prescription pot"" by George McMahon and Christopher Largen."
2,Not as expected,"Plants haven't really grown well. Replaced them with ones from local nursery (same kind, San Marzano) that are much more vigorous in their growth."
1,poor,"I did not recieve this book. The seller said amazon gave the wrong mailing address, but I recieved the other book on the same order. I am out the cost of my shipping and did not recieve my purchase."
5,I cannot stand reviewers who have not seen it but want to review it anyway.,"The morons who decided to review the movie and start our their ignorant review with ""I haven't watched them all yet, but"" should not be allowed to post.This goes to the stupid people who didn't read the book yet but will post how difficult it was to stand in line at midnight and get new newest Harry Potter edition."
1,Just cashing in on the city's name...,"Other than that, this is about as ""Miami"" as drum and bass. If you're really looking for that Miami cd, just go pick up something by Oscar G. Either his ""Made in Miami"" cd or his ""Live at Space."" Even more, go get Jerome Syndenham's ""Electric Pussycat"" or the new Rolando cd in the ""Nitelife/NRK"" label series. Even Peter R. got it right with his ""I love Miami"" cd. Deep, dark, pusling house...tribal, pouding drums. This is Miami. Not this travesty that George Acosta has synched together and called ""Miami.""Avoid at all costs unless you are into the whole trancey thing."
3,"not bad, not great","I really like Acosta and was excited when I bought this album because I saw a lot of tracks I liked were on it. Once I listened to it I was quite happy overall but a little disappointed in some areas. First off it's not quite as melodic (especially the 2nd disk haha) as I thought it would be but that's not a bad thing, just unexpected. Also, some of the track selections stink which is unfortunate. But the thing that really gets me is how long into each track the main melodies come into play. Most of the tracks take so long to build up that when they finally get going it's sort of a let down. I especially noticed this on ""let the light shine in"" which I've always particularly liked. The mix on Tiesto's Nyana is far better. Overall a good mix but not the best I have heard from this great DJ."
4,Trance not House,"Please do not let the other reviews turn you away from this CD. This is a great CD for any trance collection. I can see where people hear the house in this one, but not at all does it take away from the trance that he is so good at. I would have to say that about 15 percent of the two disk's is house. The first CD is truely a great uplifting trance CD. The second CD is also great, but some house is mixed in. Overall, this should be a deffinate purchase for any fan of this kind of music."
2,So & So,"Interesting subject, nice voices but dull melodies. There's not even one song you'll remember after you listen to this. I would recommend it to Broadway musical cd collectors and Barbara Cook fans only. The rest, please stay with West Side Story, Sound of Music or Cabaret..."
3,Jungle Jamboree Tapsy Turtle,"I was disappointed with the product. From the description, I thought the beads would easily move and attract the eye. This does not happen like the reveiw from the manufacturer states. It is constructed well, and every child is different, but my four grandchildren quickly put this toy aside."
3,Excellent small binoculars,"These Pentax small zoom binoculars bring things up close when at concerts and theater performances. I find they are best focused at the closest zoom, as when I focus at long distance and then zoom in, I need to refocus whereas when done the other way they stay in focus. The center retracting diopter focus wheel is a bit difficult to use as opposed to a ring on the right eyepiece, a more common focusing method. I do enjoy the small size of the zoom binoculars and find they work well in theaters and at outdoor events. Their price on Amazon was much lower than elsewhere. I do recommend them for someone looking for a good small zooming binocular."
2,Pentax 62217,I purchased this based on reviews. What I'm finding out is that lower priced zoom binoculars don't do zoom very well. This one zoomed with minimum effort but at the higher magnification was fuzzy on the edges and dim. Once you get above 10 power you can't hold it still enough. I obtained a return authorization and pre-paid UPS label without problem from Amazon. After a week of checking UPS managed to lose it and the local office wasn't at all helpful with how to claim. The outstanding customer service rep from Amazon took care of me in about 45 seconds.
3,DECENT BUY,"WANTED A COMPACT PAIR OF BINOCULARS TO VIEW SPORTING EVENTS THAT WOULD BE EASY TO CARRY AROUND. COMES WITH A CARRY CASE THAT LOOPS THROUGH YOUR BELT. THE OPTICS ARE GOOD, THE ZOOM FEATURE WORKS OK, I'M HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE."
4,These Windsor Chairs are great!,I am very happy with these chairs. They match very well to some I already had. They seem to be very sturdy.
3,"Good headphones, but I went with Sennheiser PX200's instead","I tried these out for a couple of days. I am a professional musician and I am very picky when it comes to sound detail.Overall, these headphones have a good sound. Clear and well-rounded. However, when I put on the Sennheiser PX200's, I felt like I could hear more detail in the music. The Sennheiser's are a bit more trebly and maybe a bit harsh at first, but I prefer them already to the Sony's. The Sony's felt a little more bland and I didn't feel quite as present with the music.I also don't like the fact that these headphones seem to want to fold up on themselves. The headband is too spring-loaded. I prefer the Sennheiser in this regard."
2,Not what I thought it was,"I am a math teacher always looking for new activities to use in my classroom. I bought this book thinking I would be able to use the activities, but I really couldnt use any of them!!"
5,really universal,"purchased this because the ""universal"" one that i purchased from Home Depot was pretty much garbage and did not fully fit the toilet without leaking. as for this universal flapper, it plugged he hole good enough so there were no leaks."
1,Does not work for me,I tried the 502 in my American Standard 1.6 gpf and it drops immediately like a rock no matter what the setting. I tried it on every setting using a full tank. It closed immediately and did not allow the tank to empty. It just did not work. I tried two of them before I gave up.
3,No answers to exercises!,"I am on Chapter 2 of this book and so far it gives a decent understanding of the language; Each section within a chapter gives exercises to assist in learning the language...but NO ANSWERS..not even in the appendix. I have no idea if I have done the exercise correct and if I don't understand the question...well too bad because then you are onto the next subject. I don't get why you would leave that out! I always try to do exercises/questions in these types of 'teach yourself books', but what makes the biggest difference is checking the answers to these questions to see if I was right or wrong. Big dissappointment with this book."
3,"The definitive ""Objects First"" book","This is the best ""objects first"" Java textbook that I have seen, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book to any teacher who wants to try this approach.That said, I haven't personally found the ""objects first"" approach to be an effective way to teach introductory programming."
1,not worth the money,"I purchased this for use in a Java class. The instructor swore by this book. In the end, it just wasn't worth the money. All the information I needed were already available online at through Sun and other Java resources."
1,NOT GOOD for Beginners...,"I bought this book because it was required for a course. Out of all of the exercise books I have used, this is by far the hardest to follow. There are not enough examples to actually teach you the information. There are no answers, so you never know if what you're doing is correct. Overall, the book is vague in its descriptions and has not given me any kind of useful Java skills. I'm sure it would be good for someone who already knows a little about Java or that has a teacher standing right by them to explain everything. Even the exercises were not very clear and hard to understand. I would recommend searching for a different book."
2,More Chronicle than History,"This book presents the story of the Musashi from the beginning until the end. It is shallow rendering of the problems related to its design and construction to is ultimate sinking.The most ironic and glossed over part is that after entering active duty, the largest and most power battleship ever constructed was used to ferry supplies. This pretty much tells the story of this ship and her sister Yamato. Should have been named the White Elephant. It seems that Admirals, as well as Generals, spend their time planning to fight the last war.There are better books out there on the subject of the Imperial Japanese Navy in WWII."
3,so-so sound but nice sony quality,"sound quality is only so-so, but is enough for tv listening, which was what i bought them for. quality is good as sony products go. nice to casual use."
1,Terrible high frequency response...sounds washed out,Terrible high frequency response....basically it is non existent. Far inferior to the free headsets that came with Sony Walkman and CD players that broke over the years. I strongly recommend against these phones. I bought two of them without checking them out in advance. This was a mistake.
5,great customer service,I didn't actually get the headphones I ordered. They got damaged when preparing for shipment and it was the last pair in stock. So they contacted me and asked if was OK to ship a better pair at no extra charge. I thought it was a great effort on their part. I got a free upgade. Great customer service.
4,decent headphone for cheap money,"This is great for the gym and long walks. Cheap money too. They need more words than my first sentence, so I write this. Not sure why one sentence won't do?"
2,basic,You probably already know more about Persians than the book writer himself.Disappointing.Better to spend more and really Learn about Persian cats.
5,Dark love story.,"This is one of my favorite love stories. The characters of Rachel and Sebastian are very complex.The love scenes are disturbing and highly erotic. Actually sitting in front of a fan while you read, may not be a bad idea. It is by far the best writting Ms. Gaffney has done.Very original. Strong prose. This is a book to keep.C. Hartford"
4,"Good product with expensive ""refills""","My boyfriend owns this and here's what I hear him say everytime:It's a great product and definitely worth owning ... however, the cleaning solution is only good for about a month (assuming you shave at least every weekday) and the refills become rather costly.At the end, it's a matter of whether or not you feel the refill is worth the time you would spend cleaning it every time you'd use it."
4,Love This Light,"DEWALT DC527 18-Volt NiCd Fluorescent Area Light, Works great , has a wire hook in the head, you can hang it up if you need to. Light up a room well, the only fault i found with it is the the clear plastic could have been white or cloudy , if you look directly at it it will hurt your eyes. 3-1/2 hours on battery. would recommend buying.The construction is plastic but it is sturdy enough to be held in your hand as a flash light."
5,Excellent Product,"The DeWalt DC527 Fluorescent Light has been an excellent addition to my DeWalt tool set. By already having extra 18v batteries around, there is always a charge available for this light. The light emitted is very bright and last for a very long time on a full battery charge. As can be expected because of the battery, the unit is a little heavier than an average light, however it feels very sturdy. This is definitely a must have for working in darkend areas (under the sink, in the attic, electrical wiring, etc)."
5,Good second light for wide illumination,"This is a nice addition to the De Walt 18 volt cordless lineup. I have used the gooseneck light for years. Since I have a plethora of 18 volt batteries from other tools in the series, it makes sense for me to use this for lighting as well.The gooseneck does a better job for task specific lighting like under a sink or peering between studs. I use this one to provide overall lighting where the power is completely out in a room or space, and it isn't worth bringing in power cords from elsewhere or setting up a generator. This augments my gooseneck nicely.I have used this light for three weeks doing rewiring. Do not purchase it and use it as your ONLY light source in a totally dark location. The incandescent models will fade and dim when the battery voltage drops. This fluorescent will stop suddenly with no warning when the voltage goes below what the electronics need to drive the lamp. For safety's sake, use it to augment other lighting."
3,Sure wish this was an all-day LED work light,"I will say first that I don't have this light, though I do have the 18V swivel head. DeWalt needs to get with the modern world and offer an LED worklight for the 18V system. The fluorescent looks like it will be quite glary and hard on your eyes, and doesn't have all that much burn time. It looks to me like the ideal light for the 18V system would be the gooseneck with an LED bulb that is just as bright but lasts for 8-12 hours. The DeWalt 18V is a great system, I love all the power tools, but it sure needs a 1st class work light that goes all day and doesn't burn out if it's dropped. LED all the way.I do see they offer a 12V LED light that looks pretty perfect. Please do the same for the 18V system."
1,Cheap Product,Awful. The frame fell apart after 10 minutes of use and couldn't be fixed. The edges of the wood were rough as well. I am so disappointed in Melissa and Doug! What a poorly made product. Zero stars for this waste of money
5,"Bright, fun, appealing to little eyes","My son is 14 months and loves playing with the letters. He has learned a few just through playing on his own time with them. Big enough not to choke IMO. I use the dry erase side to write words to show him, and he likes to erase when we are finished."
3,Great for learning numbers!,"I was actually expecting something a bit bigger but when I got it, I realized that it was PERFECT for high chair play. Now, at every mealtime, we play with the magnetic letters and practice the sounds and the names. My son also loves to play with the force of the magnets - making them fight with each other when he puts 2 letters back to back.The dry erase side isn't as useful, mainly because the marker provided isn't washable and is, in fact, REALLY HARD to get off of ANYTHING but the board."
1,USELESS,"I purchased this item for my Godchild who was going to be in the hospital so she could play with something from the hospital bed. The board shipped quickly, but she was unable to use the chalkboard because the chalk just took the paint off the board and left little to no chalk on the board. It is completely useless to her because she is too young to be trusted with the dry erase markers. I would suggest buying a different chalkboard if that is what you are going for. The dry erase board works fine as does the magnetic portion. Unfortunately the chalkboard can't be used."
5,Great Christmas gift,The little guy that received this chalk/erase board for a Christmas gift loves it and is having fun with it. Fast delivery and happy with product!
1,No Interest,"Our 9 year-old autistic grandson loves the chalkboard at school. It is a favorite activity for him there so this would fit well into our household. The magnetic letters that come with this are cardboard. He just throws them, and doesn't play with. He just broke the chalk in half on purpose, and the markers were about to be used on the wall. It isn't very big, so I feel that to him it will not hold his interest like wall chalkboards. I'll probably take it to goodwill. Sorry I bought it. For us it was a waste of money."
2,Very disappointed with quality,"My son received this chalkboard/ dry erase board as a gift THIS MORNING for Christmas. We were both excited about it and opened it right away. I eas excited for the dry erase portion, but when we used the marker provided - it writes weird and stained. I used the eraser as well as a wipe and it won't come clean. SO upset about this. The chalkboard side is good and the magnets stick. The magnets came all chipped and are pretty thin, but work.I have always loved Melissa and Doug products but this one just does not compare."
2,Poor Quality,"I brought this MiniDV Camcorder this June, and it started having vedio clogging problem after I used it for just two weeks. I contacted Sharp, and was told that I shall pay for the shipping in order to get this defective item repaired. They have one repair center in NY, one down Texas. Both of them are over 1,000 miles from where I live.I would suggest you buy something more reliable.."
1,Poor Tech Support,"I purchased a older version of the Sharp DV camera. I had problems with interferance when transferring to the PC. I checked cables, etc. Finally, I emailed tech support. Never received a response. Better stick with Sony or Canon!"
4,Worth the current price with rebate,"At the current price, if you're willing to get okay color saturation, not the greatest lighting (the camera is readily confused by light and dark areas), and good (not great) resolution, the camera is a good deal. For occasional recreational use it's fine.My main purpose for getting this camera (I got the 155U, which comes with an extra battery) was to send signals from a video astronomy CCD camera to the miniDV camcorder and then via firewire to my PC for frame processing. This camcorder records the images sent to it very well and I doubt that other than getting a dedicated digital recorder (they cost about $1K), a more [costly] camcorder would have mattered. So for that purpose I am immensely happy with the camcorder. In the same way, one can transfer your old videos to this camcorder and get very nice transfers.Overall, very much recommended with the caveats I noted in the first paragraph."
2,Specs,"The specifications on the bottom of the control are:110 - 120 V60 Hz10AChinaThe control in the pedal mechanism is a ceramic block with dozens of graphite discs in it, when you step on the pedal it progressively lowers resistance contact. I guess the ceramic block is to handle and to dissipate the heat generated. The female cord is short, less than two feet. The male end is 5 or 6 feet.It stopped working after one time, but after taking it apart (for $10 I wasn't going to return it), got it to work again.If you think of it as a very very light duty or disposable control, then you have a reason to risk buying it for $10."
1,dud,"First time I attempted to use this, it fizzled, literally. A crackling sound emitted from the pedal when I depressed it and the tool didn't turn on. I've used a different, slightly more expensive brand of pedal on my bandsaw for years without a hint of trouble. Should have stuck with that."
3,GOOD PLACE TO START.,"This book has a lot of good basic drill for the technical game of volleyball. I must say, for the coach that does not have a lot of drill tucked away in his/her head, this book is a definite asset. It has a lot of good solid drills that would help any coach. I would have like to have seen some more technical drill, but on the other hand, if your team can handle all of the drills provided, your doing alright.. Well worth the money.. Thanks"
1,broken from the get go,"this product came broken and wet, a complete waste of money.. you're better off washing your clothes in your hands.... that's how bad this machineHaier HLP21N Pulsator 1-Cubic-Foot Portable Washer"
4,Just bought this super washer but must get help for facet attaching,Just bought this super washer but can someone please help me attach it to the faucet .im trying but I really need a step by step help. Thanks greatly:)
1,still going to the laundry-mat,The washer is a major pain...it repeatedly stops and refills even though it's perfectly level. I have no ideal how to fix this problem.
1,Didn't work,"Leak water everywhere and every times, and can not work at my second useage. I have asked to exchange, but didn't get it back until now."
3,Must be hard to make a good bottle brush,"My first bottle brush was ""The First Years Bottle Nipple Brush"" but that broke after a few months and it was time to get a new brush anyway so I decided to get this one since it got better overall reviews. Well... it must be hard to make a good bottle brush... it's not terrible but because the brush is round with stiff bristles, it doesn't clean the bottom of the bottle well so now the insides of my bottles have a ring along the bottom edge that can't get cleaned. Guess it's time again to search for another bottle brush!"
3,Good for cleaning but very stiff!,"I like this brush for cleaning and that it has a separate nipple brush. But the negative part is that it is very stiff and so stiff that I have to push it inside the smaller bottles. And when I take it out, it sprays water all over me! I won't buy it again. Buy Dr Brown's instead."
1,Doesn't get the bottle fully clean,The bristles and wand are so stiff that they do not allow for any manuverability. The bottom of the bottle does not get fully cleaned. The rounded outer part of the bottom of the inside of the bottle stays dirty. I wish I could post a picture of the residue left behind.
3,Makes to much back splashes,It makes huge back splashes when you pull it out of the bottle. The one with the sponge tip works much better.
5,Exactly what was needed,"I received this about a week ago. It is exactly what we were looking for! I received pink, thank goodness, and it does what it is suppose to do! Good price for two brushes that are helpful."
5,Great brush!,"I've had this brush for well over a year and it still looks brand new. It suctions perfectly to the sink. We didn't end up bottle feeding much at all so this brush has been used mostly for dishes. Now, I even use it for pots/pans! I just run it through the dishwasher to clean it. When/if I need a new one, I'll probably get this one, again."
2,Bristles are to hard,I do like the stand up feature of the brush but the nipple brush is way too hard. I have ripped through two nipples. Then I purchased the oxo brush which worked much better and also stands up.
4,Great!!!,"The brush was great...only thing is you can not pick what color you get, so they send you any color...I really wanted a pink for my little girl, ended up with green but it's okay cause her bottles are clean..lol"
3,It's a brush,"the bristles of this bottle brush are good, but the handle is too short for bottles, which makes it more of a ""glass"" brush, that is as long as your are cleaning short glasses... Look around, you might be glad you did."
2,Doesn't work as well as others,"We didn't like this bottle brush...it doesn't work as well as the brushes with the ""sponge"" top...it's difficult to insert into the bottles and difficult for the soap to adhere to it...it's been sitting unused for months..."
3,ok but sprays everywhere!,"I have two brushes, one that is an advent, long and skinny with soft bristles that i love, the nipple part is hard plastic though so im careful with it. Then i got this brush for upstairs, i use it with Born free bottles and although it does do a decent job, it sprays everywhere when you take it out and you really have to scrub around, which sometimes seems to scratch my bottles. i think i prefer the advent softer bristles, also because yo can see what you are cleaning. im always afraid the munchkin nipple brush is going to tear the nipple."
4,Basic advice,"Useful for college students, although, as one reviewer noted, sometimes smarmy in tone. The main exhortation--and it's not bad--is to say, when confronted with an authority, ""I'm sorry, I have to talk with a lawyer."" This book helps explain why that's good advice, and the legal reasoning behind procedures. It's an old maxim of the law that ""to stand on your own rights harms no one,"" and though lots of people don't want you to believe it, this book reinforces the point. Part of the subtitle, by the way, is misleading: it's almost impossible to get a grade changed if the professor is adamant."
3,Additional resource for Multiculture course,I wanted to see if this book could be an supplemental resource to a diversity course at the university level.
5,internet & www how ro program,This book is easy to read and understand. It has been very helpful assisting me with my Web programming class.Internet & World Wide Web How to Program (3rd Edition)
3,it's a little much,"For learning how to program from scratch, i wouldn't recommend this book. It's to fast through javascript. Yet I haven't read all 1000 pages yet, that's what I've taken from it so far. Seems good for asp and stuff like that though."
3,kid koala has mad mad mad skills but doesnt display it here,"well, i must say that i am a bit disappointed here. this album comes from one of the most technical, creative dj's ever, but for some reason he doesnt show it here.......i mean he does some mediocre scratching and mixing, and his juggling is always superb , but he didnt excite me like carpal tunnel syndrome did, i waited a very long time for this to drop and after listening to it i wondered why, so sorry koala, it looks like i will be waiting for your next album cause this one didnt cure my itch for what your skills said would be on your album"
1,waste of money,This item is a piece of junk. It bent the first time we tried to use it. Not worth the money.
2,"""Into the Sun"" is terrible.","The lyrics are horrid. The music is average, at best. The only things that save this record from being among the worst things released in years are ""Photosynthesis"" and ""Pt. One of the Cowboy Trilogy"". I don't understand all the great reviews this disc has been getting; it's overproduced bubblegum pop and unfortunately it took $15 of my money to realize that. Buy ""Revolver"" again, just don't waste your money on this."
1,"It is a boring combination of sounds, the music drowns Sean","If you took the name off, this album would never sell. Much of the singing is like his mother, not John Lennon. I gave it one star only because Sean is John Lennon's son, other wise it would be one huge minus!"
1,Not worth the $$$,"To be honest with you, everyone would be better off without this product. I have downloaded FREE software on the internet that blocked more pop-ups than this program did. Save your money and get a better program."
4,Very useful and practical textbook!,"I used an earlier edition while in graduate school and found it very helpful. Griffin has boiled down and concisely described about 30 or so communication theories. What's more, he does so in practical terms and concepts that college students can easily grasp and apply. While I believe that this text is more applicable to the undergrad than grad student, it is an excellent reference and text. As a professor of communication, I now use it in my undergrad courses on communication theory.And by the way, what's all this [stuff] about liberals and communications??? I am a liberal (bleeding heart variety, and proud of it), I teach communication, and I think the book is valuable, candid, and balanced...."
2,terribly overpriced,The information that is in this book is good but it is way overpriced. I could get the same amount of information in anthor book for 30 dollars cheaper.
2,too hard,I bought this to replace an electronic heating pad for my back. I found the beads to be hard and uncomfortable to lie on.
5,moist heat pack,"Wonderful for achy backs, stiff knees or shoulders, even rolled up and behind neck. Great way to deliver comforting moist heat."
4,"Great Product, but heating time longer than stated.","The product is for my grandparents mainly because I didn't want them using electric blankets because they got burned with one once before, so I thought this would be a much safer heating pad. The pad is big, but not too big and it says warm for quite a while (~1hr). After trying various different times in the microwave, I settled on 2 minutes in the microwave for each size warms up the pad to the sufficient warmness. The cover that comes with this pad is sorta cheap and not very useful. Otherwise, this product is as advertised and great for staying warm."
4,Great read for a great day.,"First I must state, I am an avid fan of Kevin J Anderson's writings. I have tried to read any of his works that I can find, especially the Dune and Seven Suns novel series. This novel, Resurrection Inc. had just the right combination of characters, plots, and scenes to make for a wild and fun ride. The only reason I couldn't give it a full five stars is that I didn't want it to end, I wanted to know what happened next. I can only hope the muse strikes Anderson to write a companion novel to this story."
5,FANTASTIC,I HAVE READ ALMOST ALL OF JUDITH MCNAUGHTS BOOKS AND I HAVE NEVER READ A BAD ONE!!! I HOPE SHE KEEPS THEM COMING.
4,"A ""can't put down"" read","*Warning* Do not pick up this book unless you have an entire day with no interruptions, to finish it.Yes, it is that good. Yes, I totally ruined everything else I was supposed to be doing once I started reading this story. It is one that literally drives you nuts wondering what will happen next. The only way around it is to keep reading. Nothing else gets done well until it is finished!The characters are believable, the angst is palatable, the romance aspect real, the story is gripping (although a bit unbelievable at times - the only draw back in the book.) For those who love a historical romance with depth without crossing fully into dark. It doesn't get any better than this! A strong 4.5 star!"
2,I liked this least among JM's regencies...,"It was well written, as expected of a JM novel, but the plot was too cliche.'Tomboy grows into a beautiful swan. Hard man needs to be reformed.'pls. give me a break!!! There are gazillions of romance novels like that. I want something new. It's also so annoying that Alexandra wanted independence...only to later ask Jordan for money so that she can leave him! Stupid, STUPID, girl.It can't beat Almost Heaven."
4,Philips CD Radio,"This boombox is pretty cool for the price I bought it. It was refurbished, so I had to purchase from a seller. It came with all the proper accessories though. After using this boombox for almost 2 weeks, I find that I like it a lot. The only problems I have is that the remote control is absolutely useless unless you're just listening to a CD. You can't control anything else with it until you manually switch to the tuner feature. But that's fine because I didn't buy this product for the remote control. The other thing that slightly bothers me is that the CD player makes a faint squeak between songs when it's on shuffle mode. But all in all, for the price I paid for it..., it's a great product with excellent sound."
4,tight ass cd....,"Ive been wanting to increase my Sacremento rap collection lately and Yun-gun was a worthy add on to it. He's been on a million other peoples albums and that is how i heard of him. I took a chance on the album and i loved it. It starts out hard and stays hard through it. It has some dope guest stars such as, X-raided, Young droop, C-lim, A.k. and T-nutty, and the beats are dope! Its defintly worth picking up if you like the garden blocc gangsta sound."
2,Sound is only bi-mono with Treo 700p,"Unlike two other adapters I tried, (one from Radio Shack and one from Verizon,) the sound comes from BOTH ears. However, it's THE SAME SOUND. Unless all of your MP3s are of pre-1958 recordings, I would not recommend this adapter for the Treo 700p. I just got Palm's official adapter (3397WW) and I am hearing STEREO SOUND with it."
1,Pompous academic treatment of an interesting subject,"Machiavelli was realistic and courageous enough to describe what actually goes on in the real world. Even though no successful statesman ever behaved like a saint, they often felt compelled to hide their horse trading, scheming and deception behind a facade of morality and high purpose. Nick Machiavelli pulled back the curtain and showed what was really going on. J G A Pocock has drawn another curtain over what happened, a curtain of pompous academic prose. Human motives are more emoptional than intellectual, especially in highly competitive situations like politics and 'statesmanship'. Professor Pocock prefers to remain high in the academic clouds, raining polysyllables down on us. It's a poor read, a poor treatment of an interesting subject, don't buy it. (I must confess, I haven't finished the book.)"
2,Gave me intestinal issues,"Unfortunately, I'll never find out if this couldve worked for me. After the third day of taking it, my IBS started acting up pretty badly and so couldn't even go with a half dose to try and make a difference.This also happened to my daughter, who also suffers from IBS, when she was taking another of the female formulas.I'm glad it works for others, but be cautious if you have IBS or other intestinal issues."
3,Not worth the extra $$$,"This is a good looking set of earbud and the quality is fine, but definately not worth the extra $$$ compare to the Sony MDR-EX51LP or other comparable $30 range earbud. Sound quality was not any better than the Sony MDR-EX51LP and in my opinion, not as comfortable either. For comparable price of this set, I would suggest getting V-MODA Vibe or Shure E2c, both offer much better sound quality."
4,Came with the dollhouse,"Great addition to the dollhouse. We bought the loving family dollhouse that came with this set. They are cute, very simple and plain. Wish the Mom's hair would stay put. It kinda sticks up all over once you get her outta the box. We put it in a ponytail with a little rubberband."
5,MASTERFUL,"EXCELLENT book.... I cannot rate this one high enough.... at firstI thought it might have been expensive but it is NOT... the price is well WORTH it for what you get, Knuth is a master!"
2,Almost had a fire,I came on to one of these units second hand and used it for the last 4 years. One day the computer mysteriously shut off and then came back on. Then I smelled a burning smell. I shut off the computer and monitor and began to replace the monitor. The whole room had a BAD burning electronics smell. After moving the monitor I realized that the burning smell came from the Masterpiece Plus. I disassembled the unit and traced the problem back to the master power switch. The contacts failed to make a good connection and had overheated and charred the board. You could see the plastic case starting to melt. What if this had happened when we were not at home? (We often leave the computer on so I can remoltely access it.) I think it is important to design electronics so that the failure mode is safe and NOT a fire hazard.
2,Try the M240 instead,"As other reviewers have noted, this player has some serious limitations that make it impossible to use with certain kinds of downloaded content. Most serious of these is the lack of a bookmarking feature and a very clunky system for navigating within and among files, especially as you begin to fill it up. I quickly abandoned it and bought a different player by the same manufactuer: The Sansa m240 costs less and works much better. The m250 doubles the memory for about $4 more."
4,Overall pretty happy.,"I like the price and the ability to use an SD card for extra storage. The navigation is not as convenient as the iPod and other players, but it does work reasonably well.I purchased the FM transmitter and car adapter along with some better headphones and am pretty happy with this purchase."
4,"Mp3 Excellent, but problems with To Go services","I am twelve, and got the e140 for Christmas. It has worked perfectly, exceeding all expectations. I don't think that I even got a USB port, but it doesn't really matter. I have had no problems with the volume control, and the SD port cover fastens securely. I have not tried Audible, but have not had any problems with radio forgetfullness. I have not had any problemswith audio playback, as the sorting features allow you to find any track on the player. My biggest problem is that it does not work with any To Go service. I had Napster and it did now work even though it has Playsforsure, the tracks were wma's, and I had bought them. That was the only noticable difficulty, and other than that I love it."
2,dissapointed,"I made a mistake by not reading negative reviews about this product. I live in Costa Rica, so we get stuff purchased online shipped through a carrier in Miami. Now that my ""Sansa"" is not working (""Not enough memory, Connect to PC and delete 4M of songs for Sansa system file"") and the troubleshooting does not work, I was told by Sandisk that I can get the item replaced, but I would have to pay for the shipping costs, I am thinking about throwing this thing in the garbage can and forget about it. Sending this item back to the USA costs about $80.Conclusion: if you are not in the USA, think twice before purchasing this item, you may want to invest a little more and get a better product."
2,"Great concept, but the execution is disappointing","I purchased my e140 because I had a 1G memory card laying around unused and it seemed like a great opportunity to put it to work in what would become a 2 Gig MP3 player for less than seventy bucks. I previously had the 512 MB Sandisk player that was bulletproof.Sadly, the e140 is very tempramental - it seems like every time I move (I wear it on my arm) it stops and re-reads the card, the back of which is exposed the case. It also occasionally stops for no discernable reason. The battery life is truly abyssmal.I hope to still get use out of this unit as a music source on my boat, but as a wearable for the gym or working on projects, it's a failure. I'll go back to the basic 512M unit (and it's 18+ hour battery life) for everyday use. Good luck with whatever you choose."
3,Only OK,"I love the size and weight of the mp3 player. The sound is pretty nice too (with different, better headphones since the ones that came with it are pretty awful, I hate those stupid earbud things). As everyone has stated, there is no memory for this, none. You turn it on and it goes to the very first song or the very first fm station, which sucks because I always have to take the time to flip through the stations to find something to listen to. Also, I can't seem to get the 4 or 5 preset songs off of it, unless I am doing somthing wrong. Its quite annoying as I have to fast forward to get to my own music. However, it does the job and I all I really use it for is when I go to the gym, so its fine for me."
1,Do not buy this,"The software is hard to use. The sound quality is aweful. Try playing any CD in order it will not. Stay away from this product, it's cheap for good reason."
5,Fun!,I have had my player for about a week and I have to say it is really nice. The sound is great and it's easy to use...What more could you want? If you want something that is just as good as the high priced deals without the high price get this one. I am VERY HAPPY with this purchase.
2,it shuts down by itself,"I liked it at first but then i started to notice that if you shake it, hit it, or sometimes without any reason at all it would just turn off, at first i thought it was the batteries, but it happen even after i put new batteries; and that's not all it wont turn on again unless I take the battery out and put it back. This is really frustated espeically when i am on the treadmill, i can just stop fix the battery. Also the volume is weird, sometime i have to turn righ to get the volume up, well sometime it will lower the volume instead. I bought this, price being the main reason, now i wish i had pay more and not have to deal with this."
3,works fine - a few annoying lack of features,What I love about it:-Price! Cheapest 1 GB I could find.-Lightweight so slim and small-Flash drive no moving parts-FM radio-Menu screen-Clock-Plays for sure - works with Overdrive-MP3 and Windows Media Player compatibleWhat I hate about it:-Doesn't restart at where you left off when you power it back up. Very annoying if you listening to a long audio book.-Clock feature doesn't display without pushing buttons.-FM radio stations have to press forward constantly to move up the scale.
3,Not What It Is Made Up To Be,It doesn't really hold 240 songs only about 90 and if you keep adding songs it deletes other ones that are already on there. You can't charge it in the computer or anything(only by replacing the batteries). Batteries really don't last a long time only a few hours or so. I did get rechargable batteries that are helpful. It does the purpose of holding and playing some of my favorite songs.
5,A sad story in a way,"This is Pam Postema's own story about how she tried to break the glass ceiling in umpiring professional baseball. She is quite candid about her ups and downs, her mistakes and what she learned from them. She also very openly discusses the anti-female bias that still exists in professional umpiring and her umpiring relationship with people who made it to the bigs because the management passed her over.I'm an amateur umpire, so this book really spoke to me. Pam busted her hump to make it to the big leagues, fighting obstacles all the way, and at the end was washed out because of a senseless guideline. Baseball lost a good umpire and gained a black eye."
3,Good book to read if you're thinking of becoming a pro ump,"Somewhat of an interesting book, but only if you are a huge baseball fan like myself. I remember reading and hearing about Pam during umpiring years, which is why I got the book from the library when I saw it.Pam must have enjoyed her years in the minors as she spent 13 years umpiring professionally, or maybe she just couldn't face life and the reality of getting on with her life. It would be a good book for those in HS or college thinking of becoming an umpire in the pro leagues. It sets you straight as the realities of life in the minors.Pam also tells how she found out how Elvis really died."
1,Everyone was not all bad,"My parents had Pam, as well as her then supervisor, Dick Nelson, over to the house for dinner during spring training in Arizona. She seemed like a nice person. However, I think her claiming Dick Nelson was a bad supervisor was unfounded. My dad was in the Air Force with Dick and we have known him for many many years as well as his being a frequent guest in our home during his umpire years. He was always extremely nice and very fair and although he wanted Pam to succeed sometimes people don't make it and it isn't always because of a bias."
2,"Cheap, but not adequate","The quick low-down -- yes, these cartridges provide a large amount of cheap ink, but if you're looking to do any kind of photo printing you're better off with the real product. Not bad for regular printing of text/web pages, etc, but colors were washed out and inaccurate for all photos printed using these tanks. They have improved with multiple printer head cleanings and usage, but they are still a disappointment. Proving, once again, you get what you pay for."
5,Is it too good to be true?,"I have purchased 2 sets of the BCI6. They work in my Canon PIXMA and my wifes standard color printer.The packaging is excellent (plastic sealed wrapped and boxed). I have printed a half dozen pictures and can find no problem with the quality of the prints. In fact, they look better than many in-store labs. My wife has not noticed any difference in the subject inks and the Canon brand.At this point, these seem like quite a bargain."
5,"so far, so good","i bought a full set of these inks, and they are working fine, and my eyes arnt closed :)"
2,Isn't there anybody here I can like?,"While you certainly have to applaud Mr. Drooling for his detailed research, I couldn't find one developed character who I liked or for whom I could root. A little like Bonfire of the Vanities goes to Africa."
3,Mother's Memories Journal,"This is a nice journal to give as a gift -- sturdy pages, nice binding, good size, nice photo pages -- but please be aware that it is a Christian journal. On the first page there is a quote from Psalms, and each subsequent page has a reference to God and/or Bible quotes. This should be mentioned in the main review, but it's not. It's not suitable for someone who isn't Christian or if you're looking for a non-religious gift."
4,"Not revolutionary, but useful","I had a panic attack about college admissions a few months ago and read several books about it, including this one. This book is more like a college coach for one's entire high school career than a last-minute admissions guide. Dr. Cohen provides no ""tricks"" or ""secrets."" Success still depends on careful advance planning, at least the appearance of honesty, and hard work. A lot of the advice is common sense, and the theme of the book is simply that one must stay on his toes all the time, even in summer, and never rationalize his laziness. For people who are already juniors or seniors, Dr. Cohen provides an excellent section on resumes or ""brag sheets."" It's probably worth buying just for that."
3,this is an old book,"Hello, this is an old book about thorax surgery , it is from ^20s years , 100% history, is Ok for someone who is looking for a review on the history of surgery"
1,Abysmal sound quality,"The sound quality on this compilation is so poor, it is hard to judge whether the performances were any good. Save your money."
2,"Poorly written, lacks focus","I read this book as part of a class on Islamic Law, but could not even finish (and I am a law student, so I am used to reading long, boring documents). The problem with the book is that it lacks focus, and talks vaguely about historical developments in Islamic law and changes in jurisprudence, but wanders into discourses on inheritance law or other features. She rarely mentions the political context of the era except to assume all Islamic leaders were absolute tyrants. If this was supposed to be a history, it should have tracked the development of the schools and legal thought with the political/social/historical context. Instead, for the most part, it reads like a jumble of observations on evolving Islamic jurisprudence."
1,Did not fit,Product was not as described. It did not fit the sink after I measured it and according to the listed size did not fit tight enough to hold the weight of dishes.
3,The quality is good,"The quality is good, but the color, I thought, was supposed to be white. However I am enjoying using it."
2,I don't know what the other reviewers are thinking . . .,"This book isn't that helpful, at least for someone who wants basic advice about New York neighborhoods, ways to find an apartment, etc.My spouse and I have visited New York several times, and have a good idea of what neighborhoods we want to live in. We found the neighborhood descriptions and basic advice in Candace Walsh's Moving to New York to be far more helpful, though a bit dated."
1,Moving to NYC for dummies,"That should be the title of this book. Although it claims to have everything you should know when relocating to NYC it focus more on advice on moving that common sense (most part). It doesn't give much information to help you choose the neighborhood. If that's what you're looking for, buy Zany's New York City Apartment Sales and Rental Guide instead."
2,Moving to NYC for dummies,"That should be the title of this book. Although it claims to have everything you should know when relocating to NYC it focus more on advice on moving that are common sense (most part). It may be helpful for first time movers. Neverthless, It doesn't give much information to help you choose the neighborhood. If that's what you're looking for, buy Zany's New York City Apartment Sales and Rental Guide instead."
2,Not the most graceful ending of a series...,"Well, this series started off 'okay' and in my opinion ended just about the same way. The ending felt rushed. It seemed as if the author was just trying to hurry along the end of the novel by killing off characters left and right without rhyme or reason (or at least no GOOD reason). Throughout the series I would try to picture the characters and felt that it was difficult to get a true feel of how they would look. The action scenes were done fairly well and were somewhat exciting, but was all very telegraphed as well. You could see what was coming a thousand miles away. Not the most spectacular series I've ever read. Though there were some somewhat interesting characters it was all very cliche.***spoiler alert***The ending was very disappointing to me... Lukien should have just freaking died already. And honestly, I'm glad to move onto a much better series and author, maybe Robin Hobb."
3,"Effective but not right for 19""","I spend almost all my working hours in front of a computer. The screen proved to be effective as I stopped squinting at the screen while looking. Also my eyes stopped watering, which they used to sometimes. Another standard I used to measure was that my eyes were no more tired or red after working all day long.Would have given a higher rating had the description been precise. I have a 19"" monitor and this screen is unable to cover it completely. Some portions of the screen from both sides are not visible.Will recommend to smaller size monitors."
1,Horrible. You Should Avoid.,"Arrived with a broken shelf but there was no visible damage to the box. Says it supports 75 lbs. but I'm doubtful. I certainly wouldn't trust it to hold an $800 flat screen. Amazon is no help, who wants to deal with repacking this junk and the hassle of returning it? I'm going to eat my loss. I suggest you don't run the same risk."
1,Cheap rollers break,"The Winsome Wood Corner TV Stand (natural)looks good in the photo on Amazon. But don't let that fool you. There are 4 rollers for the bottom of the rack. Each roller has a plastic sleeve which easily disentegrates/cracks after the roller has been installed. When I placed my hefty tv on the stand and adjusted the location site, 2 of the 4 roller collars broke. If I leave the rollers off, the tv stand is too low on the floor for tv viewing. This is a cheaply engineered table. I advise against buying it. I am now out $85.09 :("
3,"Good Looking,but","This is an attractive piece of furniture, easy to put together and seems solid enough,but don't count on the casters. The wheels on the unit that I have would not hold in place and collapsed with even minimal movement."
5,Great product,The product is exactly what I wanted and needed - it works a treat in cleaning my George Foreman Grill
3,Not sure what is so special about these?,"I give these a three-star because they do what they say they will do which is help clean up your George Foreman grill plates, however, I paid almost eight bucks for three of these sponges and I'm starting to think I could have bought the three for a dollar scouring sponges at the store and accomplished the same thing? I don't know ... I guess they do what they're supposed to, but I'm just not sure what is special about them?"
3,Helpful but not ideal,"I bought a set of these when I bought my F5 George Foreman grill. I've had a hard time getting the grill plates clean even when using these. They aren't very durable either. Both sides started tearing within a couple of uses. They do work better than most sponges, but still don't really get the grill plates clean."
1,A waste of money,"I should have saved the money and purchased regular sponges. These ""special"" sponges didn't last as long as I had hoped and they really didn't do a better job."
1,I can't think of a worse movie than this.,"One of my family members picked this up from the Redbox along with the Warrior's Heart (another flop). She is no longer allowed to go to the redbox.Seriously, don't waste your time. The actors are terrible and the story itself is incredibly lame.Wish I could leave 0 stars."
1,Really dull movie,"We rented this because it looked like a decent family film, and my daughter loves movies about horses. There is very little about horses in this movie (despite the name). It is instead a painfully dull and badly acted film about a family of unlikeable people who spend the entire movie yelling at each other. Every once in awhile, the lead character would get on a horse and fall off - and that's about it. I strongly recommend avoiding this movie - it is truly one of the worst films I have seen in years."
1,HORRIBLE! The bad reviews are correct!,"I read the reviews before watching, and I have to agree with all the negative ones! This truly was the WORST ""horse"" movie I have ever seen! It's all about the annoying family drama (they are not even likeable!) and the main character girl is just plain awful -- always acting like a spoiled brat and throwing tantrums as an adult. Oh, it really is bad. I have seen better LIFETIME MOVIES. For real. Just be prepared. Also, the horse is gorgeous and there is hardly ANY time spent with it! It's all about the obnoxious family! Blah!"
3,Tenon Cutter,The product is just fine. The box arrived damaged and the lid clasp is not central to the front of the box. I will get good use out of the cutters and will make myself another box.they were priced right.
2,Fair sound but cord shorts out,"I've owned nearly a dozen sets of these phones. Given the low price the sound quality is decent enough, and in my case they fit reasonably well. On the downside, the cord could indeed be longer, and with constant use after two or three months you can expect the connector plug to short out."
3,No volume,They sound clear but there's just no volume to them. Maybe that's because I've gotten used to buds? But even in a quiet house I can't hear them.
4,good but not best,"hi guys,,these headphones are very good..but panasonic headphones are better than these..these have short cord length.. thats a minus.."
2,Inadequate,"I bought the headphones for my visually impaired mother to use to listen to audiobooks. Of all the 'phones we've used these were the worst. They do not fit well, and I can hear the audio from across the table. When I put them on, the voices were blurred. Disappointing for a Sony product."
3,"Low volume and no bass - good for podcasts, not for music","As some of the other reviews have mentioned, the volume through the headphones are very low so you have to raise the volume to hear at a normal level. Not a ton of bass as well. Very good for spoken word podcasts but not so great for music. On the plus side, they have a light feel when you have them on and they appear fairly durable."
3,Clear explanations,"I agree with all reviewers about this very comprehensible book. I do not agree with the title. The introduction to acoustics is general, but the applications only deals with musical aspects. This restriction is of course valid but should be reflected in the title which now suggests, in by perception, to cover a very wide scope."
5,complete and readable,"excellent book, very comprehensive. i've been reading it for seven years and still enjoy it. the only thing i wish they'd do is fix the chart next to the 'bolt area' (13-2, louden, F) and the 2,1,3, oblique mode listing on table 15-1 (it's not tangential). other than that, it's my all time favourite book on acoustics - very worth it."
3,Good for what it is,"This book is excellent as an introduction to room acoustics. But it has no focus on a myriad of other acoustical issues. It should be called 'Master Handbook of Room Acousitics.'The chapter on digital sound is laughable and perfunctory. An introduction to specifics of digital sound sampling is essential in a modern book.Some aspects of psychoacoustics are poorly presented; you should consult Roederer's Introduction to the Physics and Psychophysics of Music for this area.The contributed chapters are not particularly helpful, and their style diverges from that established by the author. These are rather technical, and the material in the book on digital sound, Fourier Analysis, and related areas (including ray tracing) is inadequate to prepare the reader for the more complex topics."
1,Bell did NOT invent the telephone.,Antonio Meucci invented the telephone. Get it straight. Enough with the lies. Teach the truth.
3,one step beyond value,This is a well researched book but the lack of photos here is dissappointing especially considering the cost $30.00??!!
1,Mythguided nonsense,"Oh, how I am loving the Harry Potter series (over and over again...) But great steaming dragon bogies: this 'sourcebook' is too much! Inspiration-spotting really isn't a spectator sport, I guess, but the whole 'Harry was once in a boat, so the author OBVIOUSLY intended us to be reminded of Jason and the Argonauts' approach is just shoddy thinking, surely? There ARE genuine mythical and spiritual roots to the Potter stories - but you won't find them here. The fact that the disclaimer - 'not approved by J K Rowling' - was hidden in gold lettering on gold background on the cover design suggests to me (alas, spotted too late!) that the book is trying to pass itself off as something it isn't. A blind guide. For goodness' sake, hold out for something Rowling DOES approve - and in the meantime, let's trust our own imaginations!"
3,A step to understanding myths.,"I was anxious to read this book since I'm a Potterite. What I thought was good about this book was explaining some metaphors and parallels to other books. I'm not an academic so I don't know how technically effective this book is. I did like the listing of mythical definitions and the real world timeline compared to the wizard world. I was offended when comparisons were made with the Nazi's and the death camps. This book is more of a thick Cliff's Notes, not for every Potter fan. The first three books are reviewed and over 120 pages are testing the reader of each chapter from the the first three books. An interesting book for an academic or someone that needs extra credit at school. The book does do justice for JK Rowling in that her style and imagination has brought a new world for readers to enjoy, and this book trys to explain Harry's similarities with other books. I'd reccommend to wait for this book to go to the clearance table before buying it."
4,Useful Money Saver Just requires a little work,"Two of my roommates each own this shoe rack (both bought from Target) and it has lasted them both 2 years. One roommate had to use a little duct tape to make it sturdy after we moved to another apartment, but otherwise it works pretty well for the both of them. I don't recommend this shoe rack if you want to keep your room open when you have guests over, as it's not very pretty. However, it works very well on the back of walk-in closet doors and bedroom doors. Based on my roommates experience with the shoe rack, I went online to buy my own and am very pleased with it after 3 months."
1,This one doesn't work!,The parts don't fit well with each other. It won't hang close enough to the door to keep shoes on the shelves. My shoes always drop to the floor when I close the door. This product doesn't work well... I'm now looking for a replacement. I'm tired of rearranging my shoes back on the shelves all the time!
1,DO NOT BUY,"I would agree with the other review here. Spent a lot time putting together to only have it fall apart. NOT happy, returning to get refund!!We bought @ bed bath and beyond for 39.99 and its featured in their ad this month."
1,worst thing i've ever bought,"In addition to being flimsy and falling apart upon hanging (despite repeated pounding of the bars into the sockets with a hammer), the cheap steel bars left a filthy residue on anything they touched, the over-the-door brackets DON'T FIT MY STANDARD-SIZED CLOSET DOOR, and once I finally managed to get it hung and placed @ 28-30 pairs of shoes on it, one of the brackets warped and left the piece of junk hanging crooked. Save your money, time and peace of mind."
5,Required reading,"I think this book should be required reading for all teens. The story was totally amazing. Hope, Courage, Just amazing. I think about how trivial my own problems are when you think about how life really is. Maybe if our children grow up knowing this kind of history the world would be a better place with more understanding and tolerant people. I would even suggest going to his website and getting him to speak at your school. http://www.bordersofhope.com/"
3,"Good tool, bad shipping","The good part is that the laser works well. The only complaint that I have with the tool is that the laser ""dot"" could be smaller. It would improve accuracy especially when using the detector at distances under 50 feet. When using the detector if you approach the dot from the bottom and make a mark when it tones out, then approach it from the top you get two different marks. Once you get used to the discrepancy you can get pretty accurate with it. Now the bad part; The care in shipping such a semi-delicate instrument stinks. It took three orders to finally get one that wasn't damaged. The first two were new units. The last one was a reconditioned unit which chose to bring to a Dewalt Factory Authorized Repair Center to have one of the vials replaced (under warranty) rather than play the return game again. I recommend that you by a device like this from a place where you can inspect it before accepting it. Sometimes the difference in price is not worth the aggravation."
4,Wintv HVR1600 Mce for Vista White Box Pci Atsc HDTV,"Wintv HVR1600 Mce for Vista White Box Pci Atsc HDTVThis is a perfect match for those running windows xp media center 2005. It gives your old Pentium IV new life. The channels come in crystal clear and the radio function takes your pc to new heights. It works with your pc's remote and has ""TiVo"" like features. If I can install it, then most novice users can also. Call pc manufacture for help, or visit website for step-by-step instructions.Los Angeles, Ca."
1,DO NOT BUY. You will be sorry.,"Purchased and installed in a new PC running Windows XP. Card totally dead. Would not register analog or digital channels, or video devices plugged into the S-Video slot. Returning for full refund."
3,Expensive but flexible,"Maybe i've been lucky but we use our Sharp projector every day for normal television and the bulbs i've been buying are lasting at least 2500hrs. We set the fans to high because it is up in the ceiling. No there is not filtration for dust, but you find the filters cause overheating on other projectors. Now you can just buy the bulb (which we do) for like $100 and Sharp made it so easy to replace (unlike those others who make ""special"" lamps)I figured they did a pretty good design. Can't beat the 3000 lumens we watch TV in the daytime easy!"
5,Es perfecto!!!,"Susie Hansen & Her Latin Band play specificly for salsa dancers, thier music is for dancing, however they play Latin jazz and salsa music. The music is jazz, and is meant for salsa dancing. She plays mambos, cha cha cha's, and others. In concert she plays more merengues and cumbia's, but her albums feature more jazz solos, and Salsa oriented music. This cd has an exellent original ""Es Muytarde"" and es perfecto! Hansen plays Latin jazz violen, and is the only gringa in the band, the rest of her band members are from Mexico and various other countries in South America(several from Cuba). A great cd!"
5,Excellent CD,"The CD includes original recordings by Chinese artists and American artists from primarily the 1930's era; there are a few songs from the 1940's and early 1950's. Excellent combination of songs. Total 50 songs on two CD's. Great buy !!! (I lived in Shanghai for 3 + years, and I could emagine the old jazz clubs in buildings still standing in the Pu Xi sections of the city, where this music would have been played in the 1930's.)"
5,Shanghai,Out of over 100 albums this one now is in my top ten. I am a chef and this is my top backround music when I'm cooking at home. I'm going to try to find more of this music.
3,Great literature but paper disappointing,"The price was great and the translation is very good, but the paper it was printed on will not last very long."
3,Great Beach Book,"I read this book on vacation and if I had been anywhere but stranded on a Mexican beach, with nothing to do but swim, sun and read, I would have put this book down after 30 pages. It is melodramatic, transparent, predictable and gratuitous in its shallow development of a synpathetic female lead. The tale of how D'Ni is ruined is interesting to any MYST/Riven fan, but over the course of the 500 pages, you realize that what is a great computer game has not been made into a great series of books. Ultimately, this is not enough about MYST/Riven to make it of any value."
2,Reading with Tequila,"Why read: Received for review from LibraryThing Early ReviewersWhat impressed me: I enjoyed that Dendle put his own voice and opinions in the reviews. It felt more personal that most movie encyclopedia reviews.What disappointed me: The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia is terribly out of date. Why publish a book in 2010 if you haven't updated the information since it was first published in 2001? A huge amount of zombie movies have been released in that time period, all of which would be of interest to zombie movie fans. Reading the reviews, Dendle often sounds like he really doesn't like the genre. He favors a few classics, but for the most part the reviews are negative, telling potential viewers not to waste their time.Recommended: No. I'd recommend reading any other zombie film review book as they would most likely be more up-to-date and written by someone who actually enjoys the films."
5,Small Book but BIG Concept,Excellent Book!Changed the way I though about my business and customers. Helped me realize what my true business is and how to better target my marketing. A must for every small business owner.
2,Be Warned,"This movie IS NOT with Glory Annen of Felicity. This is a Koo Stark movie. Amazon.com has a listing problem. I ordered this DVD twice, I returned first one, amazon.com sent the other both had different DVD cover but same Koo Stark movie. I checked online Glory Annen never made this movie. Footnote is Amazon.com customer service shined with their service and their prompt plus appropriate replies. Kudos to customer service team but DVD is incorrect."
3,lesbians on ecstasy,"Lesbians On Ecstasy, from Canada, Montréal, are Fruity Frankie on vocals, Veronique Mystique on monster bass, Jackie the Jackhammer on drum pads and Bernie Bankrupt on laptop.Their concept is taking music from various lesbian artists from the past 70ies, 80ies and 90ies, and put it into dance-music.It`s a sort of bringing these icons of the past, lesbian icons, to a new generation of lesbian and kind of tie it to the communities.The album is a mix of ElectroPunkMetalDancefloor and songs like ""the pleasure principal"", ""parachute clubbbing"" and ""bichsy"" really make you want to dance, but i think to get an complete impression you have to see them live, because live they/their songs are much more intensive, and the ""lessies on x"" are presenting their audience a very powerful and energetic show.""lesbians on ecstasy"" is an excellent band, and i think a little weakness of the album is that the mixed songs sometimes doesn`t transport their great power."
2,"Very salty, bad flavor balance",Pros:- Slightly better nutrient content than other Wheat Thins varieties.Cons:- Extraordinary amounts of salt. There are snowdrifts at the bottom of each bag.- Very brittle: you can expect many crackers to be in fragments after shipping.- Simply tastes more of salt than of anything else. Compares poorly to other Wheat Thins varieties.
1,( ),"Out of all the tracks on this CD, maybe 3 are truly live. ( )Slaughter is actually prtty good live. Why didn't they do a real livealbum? ""Shout It Out"" is just ridiculous. Blas is a good drummer, but he can't play the beat he is playing, and play a tamborine into a mic at the same time. And I don't think Mark is playing it. And the crowd that sounds like 8,000 people shouting their name; c'mon guys. Slaughter usually plays clubs now. Be honest. Look at Dio's live album. It sounds like it was recorded in a small theater or a club. If you truly like live albums that sound real, leave this one behind. END"
1,Hard to clean,"I bought two of these pans thinking it was a good price however after a few uses it was difficult to clean. The first few times I used them, everything wiped off easily with a sponge. After that, food started to get baked on so I soaked it, over night. It still wouldn't come off so I ended up having to scrub the whole thing to get it clean. I got so tired of scrubbing the ""nonstick"" pans that I tossed them. Also, when put into a preheated oven the pan warps so much it makes a loud noise and looks as though someone twisted it, eventually it does relax but I really don't think it should do that. I would recommend spending the few extra bucks to get a better pan."
1,Garbage,"I ordered this by accident. They were not the ones I read about or planned to buy. This is no one's fault but my own frazzled brain at the time of ordering. DO NOT ORDER THESE. The other negative reviews on here pegged it exactly--warp after one use, definitely not non-stick after a use or two, difficult to clean, and not true to size. I ordered three and was upset they weren't the ones I wanted. I plan to return the ones I didn't use, and will figure out a non-baking use for the one I already tried, unless I can return it as well. It might seem like these are a good price, but at half the price or less, these would still be a lousy deal because they are basically disposable--after a couple uses, they are useless.Garbage, total garbage."
2,Cookie sheets,"These cookie sheets warped slightly on first use. Also the metal is stained from the cookies, I am now using parchment paper to make cookies on them. The price was ok, but I think I'd rather pay a little more next time, and get some that are more durable."
3,Just OK...,"When I decide to order some romance books online, I rely on all these reviews on Amazon to decide whether I'm going to order a particular book or not, & I've got to say that I've found many of these reviews to be way over-rated, & this book is 1 of'em.... The other reviewers already gave the storyline, & so, I won't repeat it, but even though LG is 1 of my most favorite authors, trust me when I say that this book is worth absolutely no more than 2.5 ~ 3 stars bcs. the storyline just sounds way too contrived...."
1,Save Your $$$$$$$,"Hot Wheels are a favorite in our house. Unfortunately, this set frustrates my son and myself. The pieces will not stay connected and the car gets stuck midway down the ramp. Maybe, if all the connecting sets (which have to be purchased separately) were attached, it would be more enjoyable. Playing with it without the other track sets is nearly impossible."
3,Not bad,"I got this toy for my 2 year old since he loves cars and it looked pretty simple. He thinks its hilarious when the tiger chomps down on the cars. We haven't had any problems with it, its durable, simple to use and fun for kids. His 8 and 10 year old uncles play with it too. We'll be buying the rest of the set sometime to make it even more exciting."
1,Another Hot Wheels disappointment,"My two boys (ages 6 & 5) begged me for this toy. Since we have so many other Hot Wheels sets, none of which ever work correctly, I should have known. The assembling instructions are ridiculous. The toy never worked. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
2,"Great subject, Bad book","As there are so few children's books out there that portray nursing, I felt this would be good to add to our collection.First of all, the art work looks like it was done by a high school student...you can still see the pencil outlines!The book was too wordy and had things I just don't hear people say anymore (along the lines of ""I really dig this man."") There was a point to this story I suppose...extended breastfeeding is ok. But it got lost when the author tried to convey too much information in a children's book.I have this to say to the author: thank you for writing a book about extended breastfeeding, but next time please keep your writing at a children's level...and your artwork looking like it wasn't done by a child."
2,A disappointment,"To me, this book did not live up to these ecstatic reviews. The illustrations are ugly and the story, although with some charming ideas, was more pedantic than interesting. And to even suggest in a story that young children leave the house unbeknownst to their parents - even for a ""Toddler Town Meeting"" - is a bad idea. I'm 1000% in favor of breastfeeding until the child is ready to wean - and have put my beliefs into practice with my two children - but neither my fantastically supportive husband, my three-year-old son, nor I liked this book at all. Sorry!"
3,Enzymatic Hem-Care,"I have taken this product for quite awhile. I think it HELPS with the hemis but not without 'extra' help. I have continued to buy it, but have found, for me at least, by itself it's not sufficient. It's the best I've tried though that doesn't have a lot of junk in it."
1,Burned out too quickly!,Not sure about this product. It appears that I have changed the bulb every few weeks. I'm not sure that I will reorder this product in the future...
2,burned out prematurely,hard to beat the convenience of finding and buying the right halogen bulb at your fingertips on amazon but this bulb burned out after a few months of light use. the other halogen bulb i bought from econotone at the same time burned out after just a few hours of use.
2,In Defense of a Rocky Tenure,"I recently read Hardball: The Education of a Baseball Commissioner with the notion that this book is a defense on Bowie Kuhn's part and not a story. He's written this book, after the fact, that the trail of dirt he left cannot not be pushed to the side and forgotten about. Though, he has agreed about some of his missed calls, he has also made it known who else was at fault in say the 1981 strike, etc., etc., etc. Mr. Kuhn made some good points in the book, however he should have used the good knowledge while commissioner."
3,Cheap!,"I love hello kitty,but this toy is cheap.You can buy for it 5 dollars in other stores.The 3 characters are too big.Buy anotherhello kitty house.Not this one!"
2,hello kitty mini house,"It is cute however from the first time my 5yr old started playing with it fell apart, the back fold up panel will not stay on! the charters are tiny,almost to hard to hold out to with only 2 fingers! I would not purchase this toy again un less it was much, much cheaper, it's not worth the 11.00+ dollars"
1,poor,"Very disappointed with the size & durability of this toy, especially for the price. Hard to even play wit it because it is so small. My granddaughter loves Hello Kitty but was not that excited about this toy, which was very disappointing to me !!"
1,"Cheap, Overpriced, Unusable","This has a LOT of tiny pieces, it doesn't close up well, it has to be assembled for each use, and it is tiny. It's too childish for older kids and the pieces are too small and are a choking danger for younger kids or kids with little brothers/sisters. Avoid this - it is way too expensive and never saw use at this house. My 7 year old promptly lost two pieces in the carpet, stepped on one and hurt her foot, and that was it for this useless toy."
2,fragile and very small,the first time we opened the roof it fell off; not particularly well put together and it is very small. the pieces are so small they are difficult to pick up even by a child's small fingers. it did not meet my expectations
2,Kids Watch,The face of this watch is small. Not even close to being a good size to be a men's watch. I do not have a large wrist. This would have been something I wore when I was 9 - 14.
5,"Practical, low maintenance, and looks good too!","Pros: simple, practical, low maintenance timepiece at a great value. Jewlery? No, but wasn't designed for that.Cons: I didn't think I'd be crazy about the watchband, but I will admit that it's growing on me.Why Rating? definitely in the top 20% of satisfied buyers!Who should buy this? someone who is looking for value and practicality."
3,Average Book,"I found the book to be somewhat outdated, as it was written in 1987, but republished in 2001 without any real evidence as to any updates. I think there are better books on flycasting fundamentals then this book-with better pictures to illustrate certain casts (I bought and like Lefty Kreh's book on fundamentals). Overall, its an okay book, but again, I did not like the fact it was published in 1987 and then given it's 2001 publishing date without any real evidence as to why, except in my opinion, to make it seem more up to date then it really is. But again, I do give it three stars as it has decent information, but better and more detailed information exist elsewhere for the money."
5,*NO NEED TO REALLY REVIEW.......,"THERE AREN'T TOO MANY PRODUCTS THAT CAN GET A PERFECT REVIEW SCORE. THERE WAS NO NEED FOR ONE MORE RAVE REVIEW, BUT I COULDN'T HELP MYSELF. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE BACKYARDIGANS. WHEN MY KIDS AREN'T EVEN AROUND I FIND MYSELF SINGING THE BACKYARDIGAN TUNES. I WAS A FAN EVERY SINCE THE FIRST TIME I HEARD THE THEME SONG. I LOVE THE VOCALS. THE CHILDREN WHO SING FOR THE CHARACTERS ARE VERY TALENTED. A COUPLE OF THEM ARE EVEN FAMOUS FOR THEIR SINGING. IF YOU LOVE MUSIC, YOU'LL LOVE THIS CD. YOU MIGHT EVEN FORGET IT'S FOR KIDS."
5,We Love This CD!,"My son really enjoys the Backyardigans on Nick Jr. and I have to say, I do too!These hilarious characters, who imagine amusing adventures while in the back yard, are fun to watch--breaking out in song at a moment's notice! What's especially great is that the music of The Backyardigans features different music genres such as disco, 20's-style jazz, mambo, swing, 60's-style rock, and much more!We bought this CD for my son several weeks ago and he LOVES it! In additon to being child-friendly, though, it's PARENT friendly. Unlike other repetitive, irritating, mind-numbing kid CD's, these songs are fresh, well-sung, and downright hilarious. We put this CD among the selections in our car's CD changer, and I think my husband and I enjoy it as much as my son! We found ourselves snickering and even laughing out loud to the witty and whimsical songs on this CD.Featuring 19 upbeat songs--none of which sound the same--this CD has a run-time of 36:09.Highly recommended!"
4,Now we're all BACKYADIGANS,"Why wouldn't this be a great CD...My family loves the Backyardigans and to have the music to play lets my kids imagine the same games for themselves. We've loved it, but wish it had a few more of our favorites."
3,Color not so great,"The illustration on Amazon's product page shows a fairly saturated blue color. The Cross printed catalog shows an even more intense blue color, almost brilliant in fact.The reality is different. The pen looks almost grey in real life. It's not a bad color, but it is not as advertised. Disappointing.By the way, Fisher Space Pen makes a refill for Cross ballpoint pens. It is very good."
3,excellent ingredients but my dogs don't like it much,"I am trying to get my dogs (all shelter dogs although one is purebred) off low-quality grain-based foods and bought this to add to their high quality lamb and rice kibble, which they eat well. They wouldn't eat it at first, and then only grudgingly. I am going to try again, but I am distressed because I don't like throwing out food. I will try mixing in some cheaper stuff and trying to move toward feeding this. But I am warning anyone who is trying this that it isn't immediately appealing to my five totally different (and hungry) dogs."
4,very nice,the product came very fast and was just like how amazon explained itthe ring is very clearly written NO WAR and thick which i likebut i guess if you like small rings this isnt your ring
2,SCAT KISS? NO THANKS,"I watched this in the hope of an erotic tale. Needless to say that is not what I got. The movie does start out in that direction, but soon spirals out of control into whipping and beating. (Not to mention the low point of the film: A scat kiss.) The character J at first seems to be a sadist, as he begins whipping Y prior to having sex with her. Later in the film the whip is turned on him and his true colors begin to emerge. As this relationship progresses it seems more and more like J is just taking advantage of Y's desperate circumstances to satisfy his own obsession with the whip. I found that there was no real connection between them as the whipping becomes so pathetic you just have to laugh at him. Pass on this film."
3,about the movie lies......,The story is basically about a school girl(Y) losing virginity to a married man(J). They met very often practising the same religion and there was once that Y's brother gets to know her sister's relationship with this married man and burnt his house. Y later retaliated by asking her friends to pass message around top reach his brother's ears which made him confused that he got into a bike accident(which killed him). Y learnt of his brother's death and went back to the family where she later met J the last time in Paris before she flew off to Brazil to meet her kins there. There is a hardcore scene after viewing the DVD for a few minutes. They are two sex scenes on bed and a handful of oral sex scenes and the beating scenes(almost similar to Japanese style of love 'torture') switched between the Y and J where they are beating marks on the Ass. Recommended purchase for those whom are interested in this genre of movie.
1,What a nightmare,"Not only is my system crawling, but I have spent nearly 6 weeks since trouble shooting the SpamKiller software trying to get my Outlook Express to work properly. I tried every fix in their online arsenal, contacted McAffee via their chat and even the technician couldn't explain why spamkiller was killing my email. He suggested to uninstall and reload program. He even suggested that I buy the extended download option. I did that and nothing changed. I have now had to unistall in hopes of anyone being able to contact me (I couldn't receieve or send...even to those on my ""friends"" list) A waste of 40 or 50 hours of my time.Don't buy....not worth the so-called bells and whistles (I paid 69.99) I wish I had just updated my virus scan and left it at that. My server provides the other stuff free."
1,Duff product.,I picked this up with my dell. The Dell was great. McAfee was fine until I switched on the privacy service. It was so painful I uninstalled it - that's when the problems really started. It stopped all internet access. Finding your way around the McAfee support site is really hard - very confusing and ultimately no solution. At the momemt I can use the internet but if I use the WinXP 'switch user' option and leave a copy of IE running the second user cannot use the internet.Too much effort to work out how to fix it. We just have to live with it. Needless to say McAfee wont get any more money from me. I wish I'd read this site before parting with my money.
2,any one know a GOOD security suite,"McAfee insists on checking with the internet every time I reboot the computer to make sure I am REALLY a registered user. Half the time I can't remember my password and have to go back and find it. This is annoying. Also, when it once found a virus in something, it didn't know what to do with it. So I had to go find another software to remove it. What do I have this software for if it lets them in? I won't renew."
1,Worse than Norton,"I thought Norton was bad, constantly freezing my computer with one or another of its components. Well, McAfee is worse. For just anti-virus, you might want to try Avast. For a suite to try, I have no recommendations except ... don't."
2,very confusing book,"I agree a lot with Wolf's review of this book. It just dosent add up. I think that generally, people throw around the word Karma carelessly. Before your born, you choose the experiences you were going to have, the signigigant relationships, life mission etc. You choose the way your going to grow on your spiritual path. To write a book that says you can bypass this is misleading. However, I do believe there are certain cellular and DNA memories from past lives and current lives that CAN be released. I suggest others interested in Karma and other related books search for the Matthew books ""Matthew tell me about Heaven"" by suzy wardBotton line, nomatter what, your here to grow on this planet Earth, otherwise why would we come?I suggest others interested in Karma"
1,product received with no lid and has been used,I just opened my package to find the product has no lid and has cream inside the spout so it has been used... I'm not happy with that. The product arrived quickly but body cream products arriving opened and used is just no good.
2,ok for the price,"I've had pyramid.speakers before,amazon stands behind what they sell,first time I oredered these speakers,the wrong size came,amazon made good and gave me credit,so thanks for that,now the speakers were a little lightweight for being 2 speakers with 100 oz magnets,then I took them out of the box and the magnet were pretty puny,definateliy not 100 oz magnets,they sound ok ,more like 30 or 40 oz magnets,I have 6x9's I got elsewhere with 50 oz magnets that are bigger,pyramid is not being truthful on the specs,they sell other speaker with 60 or 70 oz magnets that are bigger than these,I switched to my old speakers with 50 oz magnets,I would recommend gettng pyle or kicker 6x 9's, I have pyle 5.25"" in my doors that put out pretty good bass for $35 from amazon.9"
1,It is terrible!!! There is nothing but a small box in the package! where is my earing??,It is so terrible and unbelievable that there is nothing but a small empty box in the package!!! Where is my earing???
5,Beautiful without being ostentatious,My wife liked these so much she added the companion necklace to her wishlist. The earrings for Christmas and the necklace for Valentine's day. I never had it so easy.
2,Too difficult,"My four-and-a-half year old is very computer savy and can play most games age graded for 5-7 by himself. This game is so difficult that he not only needs help from Mom and Dad, but Mom and Dad can barely get through the beginning games. The graphics are great and the themeing very fun (only making my son want to play more), but I would only recommend this game for a child of at least 8 with a lot of acarde experience"
5,My Favorite Hat Book,"I have been knitting for several years now and all that time I had been looking for my ideal hat book, and this was it! I particularly was looking for more traditional nordic patters--I'm a MN Scandinavian--and this book actually contained more than one (plus a number of other lovely designs inspired by other peoples and regions). I've knit more patterns from this book than I have for any other knitting or crochet books in my library. The patterns are clearly written and tremendous fun to knit. I'm also impressed by the crown patterns done while decreasing. Overall, a fantastic book."
4,trad knitting,"The patterns are classic, and in Norway we all have hats like this. So the book is very useful. I have observed that the Norwegian sweaters and patterns are coming into fashion again, so this book can get a new life. My fifth star would have been shining if the author had used thicker yarn, 23-26 st per 10 cm is more ""normal"" for this kind of garments. It makes them warmer and the pattern easier to knit.Tips: Some patterns show a section of a hat to repeat: Easily you can knit mittens using one section of a hat -- with my gauge!"
2,Too many ads,Way too many ads. I felt that this magazine didn't really have any great articles. Out of a 1 year subscription I maybe got 3 good and useful articles out of it.
4,Brides magazine,Love the magazine and the price! Lots of gown pics featured that get you to think outside the box. My fiance and I are thinking of going for a 20s themed wedding due to the different styles of gowns and tux's. I was stressin about palnning but with the help of the websites recommended and the magazine its kinda fun. Thanks Brides!
3,For the Fiancee,"I bought this subscription for my Fiancee, she loves it, I however an impartial 3 stars...."
1,great if you were an upholster,was mislead on the staplegun the add isn't clear enough i wanted a staple gun that would shoot 1/4 inch wide staples 3 inches long and shorter the add sucked
5,Easy to remember,"I order these every 3 months, so I get the 15% savings, save a trip to the store, free shipping, plus it is a reminder to change out the toothbrush heads every 3 months."
2,"Too big, too hard",This is a nice idea for a brush but poorly executed. The brush is oval shaped and too big so that it is hard to brush individual teeth with precision. The bristles are also too hard and much longer than the polishing cup so that the polishing cup will not make solid contact with your teeth with light pressure. Light pressure is what should be used as putting too much pressure can cause wear on your teeth and gums. I recommend Oral-B Sensitive brush heads as they have soft bristles that give a little with pressure and are small and round in shape so that it is easy to brush every surface of each individual tooth.
4,authentic product,very happy with the brush heads since they are original and not some sort of cheaper generic product that doesn't even fit in the toothbrush
5,Great toothbrush,I love this Oral-B replacement brush head. It's similar to the one used in the dentist office. Really makes my teeth feel clean. Would definitely recommend it.
3,Effective?,I don't know if I'd say these are effective for polishing. I received the toothbrush as a dental professional trial and purchased these polishing heads to test them out. I didn't feel it provided anything extra that wasn't received from the brushing heads that came with it.
4,It's allright but it gets old,"Allright this game is pretty cool but if your looking for a real hockey game this is not for you. Unrealistic and fake gameplay Hitz does not deliver even the slightest bit of realisim. But, aside from that fact, it is a very fun fast pace game. If you play alone then the game is really not that fun, but with two or more people it is a riote(check my spelling on that!). Creating a team is a little of a pain. Instead of creating a really good team right away, you have to earn it by playing your sorry team against the real NHL teams. Of course the teams are dumbed down a bit to make it a little bit easier but it still takes a very very very long time. I'm still working on it.(Darn I just lost!) Oh,... uh anyway...umm...Hitz....Hitz...man. Hitz what can I say."
3,too many bugs equals too much frustration,"Beautiful graphics (if you can get the game to run) and fun scenarios (if you don't have to repeatedly reload the game due to lock ups). Talk about frustration. Okay, I didn't spend last years salary on a computer but give me a break. System requirements should include 'state of the art computer with a separate room for the graphics card and RAM.'"
3,The best war in the alpha quadrant in your hands,"Dominion war is in your hands. You can be a the dominion or the Federation, Klingon, and Romulan. YOu have to get it."
1,Typical creationist garbage,"Creation ""science"" is based solely on the biblical creation myth and for nearly 100 years (more if you count the protests in the 1800's) creationists have been attacking science to desperately convince people that 200 years of scientfic study is wrong.As always they fail miserably depending solely on the same old lies and misinformation that is the sole basis of so called ""evidence"".The truth is, evolution is a reality. The earth is billions of years old. There was never any global flood. Get a real science book if you want to learn science. DLF is worthless."
5,Amazing,"This book was fantastic. It completely captured the imporant aspects of punk and expressed them in a way thats relatable to the reader. Inspiring, funny, and overall a great read. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in zines or punk culture."
4,Well worth the 9 bucks,This is one of those rare CD's Where every song Rocks and there are no throw away.. This band is definately new and different They are bringing Rock back in a big way!
4,Good textbook,"We were required to buy this textbook for our Engineering Economics class at UT-Austin. I found this book helpful as an introduction to business. It gave us quite a number of examples and review questions to help us understand the major concepts. Even though the book may have contained a little too much information, I really liked it since I learnt a lot from it."
2,Too Country,I was disappointed in this book. It didn't have anything good in it at all. Too county and crafty to even look good. I wouldn't recommend any serious Halloween decorator buy this book.
2,Great movie / poor condition,Received this DVD suposed to be good condition but it was from a library witch had been checked out numerous times and the case had bite marks on the corners where it looked like a dog had been catching it and the DVD itself is worn. Hope it last a little time for the kids. Would not even resell it on Amazon as I don't think it should have been sold in the first place. VERY POOR CONDITION.
5,Excellent read!,Interesting story of a young man who survived many hardships during the holocaust and during the building of a new nation. Couldn't put this book down I finished reading it.
5,Magnificent Visionary Musical Journey,"This extraordinary DVD and CD will take you around the world and into the deepest mysteries of human being, through powerful music, compelling video footage, and thought provoking commentary. The whole is far greater than the sum of it's components. This inspired visionary and musical journey will take you to unforgettable places on the planet, and in your own psyche. Not to be missed!!!"
5,Electronica to a Religous Scale,"I don't know if I've ever heard more beautiful music before in my life. ""1 Giant Leap"" lives up to their name, combinding the organic and spiritual elements of tribal chanting with electronic beats, creating a more than ambient, but not quite techno vibe, and in essence, creating their own genre. For fans of Moby, ""I Giant Leap"" is a must have. Check out the dialogue before track six and also my favorite track, ""my culture""."
4,AE Solar Shower,The most durable solar shower we've found. It's made of heavy gauge materials meant to take more than the average wear and tear. Workmanship is good with seams welded right. Love the wide mouth opening and quality handle.The only issue we've had with these products is a joint failure right where the hose exits the bag. The 90 degree elbow fitting started to leak meaning we'd loose significant amounts of water while trying to heat it up for a shower! Frustrating to say the least. We fixed it with silicone caulking. Not pretty but it works.
1,Peice of junk,I bought this lamp for my daughters bedroom and got one week out of it before it totally went dead on me. The lamp has a simple push-button mechanism for turning it on but it stopped responding after a week. Very disappointed and will never buy these sorts of items from this vendor again. Total piece of junk and not worth any kind of money.
4,Satisfied...,"I bought this because my daughter has a Tinkerbell themed room and it went perfect. When I received it, it was defective but they offered to send a new one right away and I'm glad I didn't just decide to say ""no and return my money"" it was worth buying and my daughter loves it..."
1,"Worthless, arrived broken and just stupid","Like everyone else said, nothing about this lamp makes any sense... and Tinkerbell is held on by a 1/8"" thick piece of cheap plastic so when she opened the box on Christmas morning, Tinkerbell was dead, laying next to the lamp broken. Glued her back on, tried it out, just junk. Dont buy it, and I dont usually give negative reviews for things unless I believe they are absolutely worthless."
5,"Get Ready, Great Ready!","This book is life altering and powerful. It helped me better understand God and my relationship with Him. I feel more powerful, more certain and secure. I was given this book by a stranger and I thank her. She worked at a bookstore. Many wonderful, surprising things have come into my life since reading this book. It has changed the way I view the world. When I first began reading it, I could not put it down! It was like a magnetic force. Please, please, please buy this book. The language is simple, clear and direct. It's a well organized piece of work that is perfect for studying since the books overlap and reinforce basic principles. BUY IT!"
3,Bridges at Toko-Ri,Fairly good movie which I saw in 1950's. Friends say it contributed to my not joining the USMC in 1951.
1,Disappointing,"Very superficial and not very helpful. I expected an analysis of behavior and attitudes and found a superficial description of the most obvious things you see and suffer every day.Politically correct writing is fine when you don't want to offend a proud Spaniard, but not at all helpful for a struggling stranger.I cannot recommend this book. For me it was a waste of time."
3,amusing if you've got a cat,"I've owned a recording of this cd on tape for years; I finally went out and got the cd for myself. Something about the quality of the recording on the cd drives my cat nuts! Now I get not only the amusement of listening to Christmas songs sung by cats, I also get to enjoy my poor, confused kitty desperatly looking round the house to try and figure out where all these other cats are! If you like cats, you'll enjoy this cd. But if you've got a cat like mine, you'll enjoy your cats reactions even more."
1,For hated enemies only....,"Through bad luck, I ""won"" this CD at my office's Christmas white elephant gift exchange last year. I laughed and proceeded to put the CD on. Shrieks of horror ensued shortly thereafter.This might (MIGHT!) be funny or cute for about, oh, 10 seconds. But 20 songs for over 40 minutes is something else - pure torture. If this CD were played at GITMO, it would be torture.You can even like cats and absolutely hate this screeching racket.Buy it for a joke or buy it to torture someone. But please, please, please don't buy it as a real gift for someone. Not if you love them."
1,All the beauty of a broken refrigerator...,"It sounds like what the ""composer"" did was to sample a minute or two of someone chanting ""OM"", switched his synthesizer in loop mode, cranked up the reverb, then recorded an hour's worth of the resulting noise. What he captured was a monotonous, droning hum that bears absolutely no resemblence to an authentic chant.Although the liner notes pay lip service to the benefits of chanting ""OM"", the composer doesn't seem to understand that OM really consists of four sounds: A-U-M followed by the silence between repetitions. The liner notes also do a little too much advertising of other products and seminars available from the composer.Recommendation: Find an album of real chanting and immerse yourself in it. The ""Ultimate OM"" is the absolute height of New Age drivel."
4,Great Pictures - Light History,"If you love everything Mercedes this book (at Amazon prices) will not disappoint. History is a bit lacking, picures were very well done. Good little book."
2,Meh,"Only buy if you're a die hard Daria fan. A senseless point and click adventure game full of bugs. It often dims the screen and/or crashes. Not much storyline. If you can find a real cheap copy it might be worth the investment but otherwise, avoid."
5,Brian covers Brian,"Its no secret that Brian's Wilson life after Pet Sounds was a roller coaster ride. As a results he suffered a great deal and was forced out from performing music for a very long time. This is Brian Wilson finding himself again in a very emotional concert recording. Brian Wilson plays like those years never happened. Do not get me wrong both the songs and the performer have aged but they have done it with grace and whatever is lacking in voice is balanced by energy and emotion.Brian Wilson is backed by an excelent band that provides the adecuate surroundings for Brian's voice to flow through the songs. This CD covers all grounds of the Beach Boys music specially it provides live interpretation of Pet Sounds songs that were never recorded live. Also, it cover newer materia and covers from other bands.Overall is a recording that promises many enjoyable moments and stands as reminder of what a great songwritter Brain Wilson is."
4,Excellent for Southern history lovers.,"An excellent book, outlining one man's search into his family's history, and what he found. Extremely intersting if interested in the history of the South, slavery and how the families of the (former)slaveholders felt as well the families of the slaves felt. As well as how both sides have come to grips with their shared past."
4,Insightful and Different,"Mr. Ball explored an area that very few attempt to explore in their families. Having visited Charleston recently, gave me a better idea of the area his family's plantations were located. It was very enjoyable to read about the quilt-work of these family members, who are of both African and European descent and how they approach their difficult past with healing."
1,did he ever meet a fact he didn't like?,"Picked up this book with eagerness, but have been so disappointed I can barely get through... Desperately earnest and well-intentioned, fascinating family info, yes. But Ball can't resist regaling us with every fact he ever knew, just to show off his prodigious research (""Philadelphia was founded in 1682"") and his much-praised interviews with the slaves' descendants are composed mainly of ""business"" (they look at the floor, they smile, they take a breath), descriptions of people's eyes (melting, warming, they sound kind of like pancakes), and such profound explanations for slavery as ""Because people are cruel."" (Oh, that explains it.) How this ever got the National Book award is beyond me -- the judges must have been so snowed by the ""honesty"" of a book about slave-owning they couldn't admit to themselves that even honesty can be badly written, trite, and boring."
4,Historically impressive story-telling,"I would give this book 5 stars for the amount of research and heart that went into it's writing, but only a 3 for it's ability to stand on it's own as a piece of literature. That gives us an average of 4 stars. No doubt, I am envious of Mr. Balls techniques in learning the facts and his entire family for the foresight to document their lives so well. Maybe the latter was due to a feeling of self-importance that seemed typical of some of Mr. Ball's ancestors, but the genealogic consequences are amazing. I learned much from this book and feel that, as a sequence of short-stories it works quite well, which may have been the authors intent. Regardless, this was well worth the effort for me, a person born and raised in the South."
2,Reading this book was trudgery,"While it is fascinating to contemplate the time Edward Ball spent researching his family history, I found reading this book to be quite a chore. Some parts of the book, particularly about the way the Ball family and slaves lived during slavery and reformation, were fascinating and I wanted more of it. But many parts of the book were completely dull and poorly written. I had to force my way through most of it. Congratulations to Ball and his publicists for a well-hyped novel, but I believe that's what most of it was -- hype. I was extremely disappointed."
2,"Buy the other ""Voyeur""","I bought ""Voyeur (Originals)"" because it came out before the other version with additonal tracks and I had waited over 15 years for this album to come out on CD. I bought a number of Kim's CDs and really liked the sound: no complaints. I swear that this version was mastered from an LP record as I'm positive I can hear clicks and pops and it sounds scratchy. I just bought the other version and I'm very very happy with the remastering work done. I finally got my most wanted Kim Carnes albums FINALLY on CD. Yay! (I bought Cafe Racers and Barking at Airplanes as well)."
3,"Opulent, yet a little boring","The costumes of Loretta Young over shadow all the other women in the film. They are way too large. A great cast, an epic sand storm near the end and great sets, but it's not enough. It is at times rather slow moving and also a little boring. It's obvious that the exact same set for Napoleon's grand ball, the tennis game in the beginning and the Parliament in London are all the same."
5,SUEZ,I REALLY LOVED THIS MOVIE VERY MUCH. I AM INTO HISTORICAL MOVIES VERY MUCH. I REALLY LIKE TYRONE POWER AND LORETTA YOUNG VERY MUCH.
5,Brilliant and Very Well Written,"As the years pass, and the Israeli 'New Historians' find their way into the mainstream, David Hirst's account becomes all the more impressive.Exploding cherished myths like 'a land without a people' and the 'defensive' nature of Israel's many wars; the book manages to be detailed yet very readable.It's been updated several times, and although some of the most recent events are necessarily missing, it's a superb introduction to an intractable conflict."
4,A good book,"I recommend buying this book without any hesitation. I am a practitioner and instructor of facial yoga for years and this book has taught me new tricks I did not know. The instructions for the execution of the exercises are very precise. I think that this method is the product of many years of practice by the author and she shows a solid knowledge of facial anatomy. Unlike other methods that can be harmful for facial structures, this system is very respectful to the face while very effective.The recommendations to strengthen the area of the mouth are excellent. If you ask me to criticize something in the book, I miss more exercises for the area of the eyes.My mother tongue is not English so I apologize if I have not express myself properly. So in summary, I like the book.Regards :)"
2,"Save your money, this book is almost the same as the first one.","I ordered this book with the intention to learn prayers from the angels. What I got was an almost exact copy of the first book. I found the first book sweet and refreshing, so naturally I would be interested in the second book with the expectation that there would be new information and prayers from the angels.All I got was a reproduction and family stories. I felt that it was a waste of my time and money. I wouldn't recommend this book, just read the first one. You'll get your money's worth that way."
3,"Prefer the ""Walk"" series","For some reason, my husband and I do not use this one much. Maybe it's the selection of music.... the beat is awesome enough. But we just prefer the other SHAPE music."
3,More of an architecture study than a view of the country.,"I got this book for my mom, who's parents both came from Finland. Frankly I was disappointed by it. From the title and cover photo, I thought it would be a broad view of Finnish life, a look at the traditions and the common people of the country. It seems more like a bunch of photos of artsy-fartsy homes; a very limited study in architectural style."
5,I loved it!,"Winter Nights was a beautifully written book by three extremely talented authors. I really enjoyed reading the book. Ms Ray, Ms Hailstock, and Ms Hill are some of my favorite authors. They have brilliant writting styles that not just I enjoy! The novellas by the above authors are a must read. Much love to all three authors!"
4,Good series,Better even that some of the movie remakes.Good series! I like the characters and the plots. Better than most TV shows today.
2,Robin Hood,It's awlful. I've endured a number of shows hoping it would get better but it has only become worse. I would not recommend it.
2,Please try harder,"There was fast shipping involved and the product seemed to be in good condition, however when i tried to watch it two of the episodes did not work at all and one skipped around a lot and was difficult to watch. i usually expect more from the amazon backed sellers and was extremely disappointed."
5,A Must See for Everyone!!!!,"I stumbled across this show flipping channels, what a find. I watched a few episodes and immediately bought Season One from Amazon,Robin Hood - Season 1. What a great series. They don't make television like this anymore, it is entertainment for the whole family and a great version of an age old story. Jonas Armstrong is amazing as Robin Hood, my all time favorite, in fact, and he has a fabulous cast to back him up. The show is full of action, drama, romance, humor, and is just an all around good time. I recommend this for everyone, Men will like it, Women will LOVE IT! Children will enjoy it too. Even my 18 year old son loved it! It is well written, expertly acted and I can not wait for Season 2. Bravo to the entire cast, Bravo to the writers, producers, directors and to BBC America for airing it. Did I love it? A Clue.... YES!!!!!!!!"
2,So unhappy that this wasn't worth watching...,"I've really been in the mood to watch something from the Robin Hood genre, but after about 10 minutes of this (TWICE, I gave it a second try after a couple of months) I was ready to switch to something less annoying (like, Dora the Explorer!) From the lace up boots (and all the other really bad costumes) to the makeup-plastered-on generic wench, just really poorly done.There did seem to be a bit of good repport between Robin and his man servant in the 10 minutes that I did watch, and from that I thought the acting might not be too terrible, but then I saw the fight scene with the wench's father, and I knew what I would have to slog through in order to see the few gems. No thanks..."
5,Best Price Around!,"My hubby & I got hooked on this show through the BBC, but was shocked when we went to purchase it at the Local BBuy - Holy Cow was it expensive! $72.00 for a TV dvd series? Are you kidding?! I was so surprised when I saw this on Amazon for the price & snatched it up for my husband's Bday - we love it! Thanks for the deal, Amazon!"
2,Please shoot me...,"Please, someone shoot me. I love the Robin Hood legends and I love period films. Unfortunately, this Robin Hood is lame. Low production, (think Xena and Hercules...but least Xena and Hercules look like they can handle their weapons). This is certainly NOT a period series. Supposedly this Robin Hood has been given a 'modern twist'and thats ok...but it makes me crazy that we are told this takes place in the middle ages, yet our characters continually use VERY modern terms. Kinda kills the 'period' idea. Oh, did I mention the terrible acting and the fact that none of the characters are likable. I just didn't feel anything for them. Mel Brookes' ""When Things Were Rotten"" was much more amusing and enjoyable."
1,"If you're looking for realism, this ain't it.","I purchased this based on the rave reviews published here. I will never make that mistake again.I think this was created for people who dislike all the violence and nudity in period movies made these days. They want to watch something that looks and feels like the TV shows they saw as children. Well, this certainly fits the bill. It's like a Robin Hood Tv show from the 1950s, complete with unbelievably cheap and tacky sets, costumes and fight sequences. The stories are so simple a four year old would be bored. There is some clever dialogue, but the amateur acting kills it before it leaves the actors' mouths.If you long for the good old innocent days of early TV, this is for you. All others, beware."
3,Robin Hood,Okay but too brutal for my taste. I. Would like it better if it was less graphic. I did not understand why robin lets the sheriff live.
4,Well worth watching,"While this certainly is not high brow english theater, the show is fun and the characters engaging. Filled with sly nods to modern day (watch the costumes which are wonderfully playful at times), the show is a fun filled, exciting time. Give it a couple of episodes and you will want more. Certainly not ""believable"", but very enjoyable."
4,Catchy Dialogue - Waiting in Line for Author's next Book,"Now that I know about this first book by the author, I find myself waiting in line to learn when the next one is coming out!"
3,Cost is only one of many factors.,"Some product reviews (particularly food) in Consumer Reports are out of wack with reality; e.g., how many people purchase mayonaise based solely upon cost per ounce? Taste and nutrition facts, I believe are more important - although they receive no consideration."
5,The single most useful magazine I have ever subscribed to,"I have been getting Consumer Reports since college and have read every one nearly cover to cover. Their unbiased reviews and excellent content never cease to amaze. My wife and I actually keep all of the issues we get and then take the relevant one with us to the store when we go to make a major purchase. The nice thing is that the organization that runs it is a non-profit organization and they use the subscriptions and donations to buy the products they review, so you can count on very few conflicts of interest."
3,Not a big deal,"The real reason that everyone makes such a big deal about Maupassant is because he mostly wrote about sex. His stories are entertaining but not extraordinary. This might be an interesting library check-out book, but not one worth buying."
5,Amazing,"This cd is awesome, i have been waiting for the new release ever since i heard about Jason's coming to the band. His work in Affinity was great and i was anxious to hear the new sound. I was impressed with every song on the album, especially ""a blank page empire"", ""the sound"", and ""on legendary"". This is a must have album"
5,Wonderful!!!,"FSF rocked with Chris Carabba, but I think Jason Gleason does a GREAT job at filling his place. This record shows their progression as a band, and although a bit different from the first, obviously, it is great never the less. Also, you have to love the artwork, and the poetry by Chad's sister (I think it's his sister...). Anyways, this is a great CD, so give it a chance even if you didn't like FSF when Chris was singing."
1,christian emo...excuse me while i vomit...,"furtherseemsforever needs to just give it up already. they've gone thru 3 lead singers in 3 albums, and every single one sounds crappier than the last. following in the trend of most modern day christian acts (except for maybe the talentless relient k), there is no blatent mention of god or jesus, only further proving that most modern christian acts are more in it for a record deal rather than to preach. if you actually like this crap, than you really do need jesus... i heard he was living somewhere in pamona, maybe you should look him up."
2,Where's the motivation?,"I have seen FSF in concert twice, once 4 months before the release of this album, once 4 months after the release of this album. The first show I saw them in they were really lacking, came out strong but had almost nothing good to play towards the end of the show. The second time I saw them, they rocked and put on an amazing show so I was motivated to go out and buy the album. The first two songs are great, but after that it's like the tempo of the album comes to a screetching hault and it just stops rocking so much. It's a good effort for changing frontmen between two albums, but it shows a lot more potential then it is actually good. With the improvement between their two shows I saw, I have a feeling their NEXT album will be the one to get."
2,Not Worth Your Money!,"Okay. First off all, I love online multiplayer games. So I got this game because it looked preaty cool. It's Not! You can't play online. The game does include 10 multiplayer maps for deathmatch and capture the flag but there are no active servers to play online. The single player is worth a try... The problem is when you play there are lots of weird glitches. If you really want to try this game why don't you just download the demo at http://www.ferrago.com/downloads/file/119 If you want online action stick with the awsome Tribes series"
3,1 out of the 3 short films were good...,"These short films are probably best for ages 5 and up since there is a ghost and zombie carrots turning everyone into zombies. The Pig Who Cried Werewolf was cheesy, Night of the Living Carrots was great!, and The Ghost of Lord Farquaad...let's just say very strange, especially since it was made for 3D but you can't view it in 3D so it makes it look weird at times. These are VERY short ""short movies."" You're better of purchasing the new combo pack that was just released of ALL the Shrek & Monsters vs. Aliens Halloween movies (which includes this one) that are out called Dreamworks Shrek's Spooky Stories. It has Shrek's Thrilling Tales, Scared Shrekless + Thriller, and the new Monsters vs. Aliens Mutant Pumpkins from Outer Space (the best out of all the shorts in my opinion!)."
5,A killer cliffhanger,"When I started reading YELLOW, I thought, okay, a cute copy of FAKE, sorta like FAKE Lite. But once I start a series, I like to see it through, so I went into Volume 3 with no greater expectations than ""they'll wait till Book 4 for the Big Moment between these two"".Well, I was definitely wrong on that point. The author knows how to throw a curve ball when you're expecting a straight pitch, and the cliffhanger at the end of this volume was completely unnerving. With all the ""trash yaoi"" out there (with the standardized plots and predictable characters), this one is emerging as something on par with FAKE in its own right.As noted, do NOT start reading the series with this volume. You'll need info from the two previous books for it to make sense and to see how wonderfully the sexual tension is brought up step by step."
2,Cheap metal drawer glides,"Absolutely beautiful piece of furniture. The bead-board sides, scrolled accents, and warm finish make this piece look truly ""rich"" (and not too cutesy). Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in how cheap and flimsy it felt at the store. The drawers are on crummy metal side gliders. Doesn't feel like the expensive piece it is, and looks like. On the plus side, the drawers do have 'stops' on them (so the can't be pulled all the way out by little ones)."
3,Drawers aren't the Best,I have been completely happy for 16 months until just a few weeks ago...one of the drawers on both the chest and changing table won't close completely. It feels like they aren't sliding right. I don't know what's up. For the price I expected more!!!
1,Not what I wanted,"There is nothing wrong with the glasses, but I didn't realize how big they were. I wanted smaller, shorter stemmed glasses. It's too much trouble to send them back, so I'll give them as a gift."
3,Not elegant at all,"So these wine glasses are built like a tank. Heavy and thick. But they are not elegant AT ALL. The rim is thick and the stem is short. If you're looking for a true wine lover's glass and something a bit more sophisticated, these are not it. I purchased some Riedels that are way better. Sure they cost much more, but they're much high quality and oh so elegant!"
1,Worst Phone Ever!!!,I don't even want to give this phone one star!! It's the worst phone I've ever purchased!! The static was worse than nails on a chalk board....very annoying! I returned it to Target.
4,Wee Love Wee Sing For Christmas!!!,"Our little daughter is 4 and I got this Wee Sing a couple of weeks before Christmas for her. We are STILL playing it on every single car ride mid-January and I don't foresee her allowing me to put it away any time soon! She has her favorites and her VERY favorites and pretty close to which order they appear in! She sings along at the top of her lungs. The CD gives her confidence. Mom loves it because it's wholesome and a mix of Christian and popular secular Christmas jingles and songs.Mom personally prefers Wee Sing for Halloween a tad better as more of the songs were sung by children. Wee Sing for Christmas has many more adult-sung songs, but still good as they are geared for children. Over all: win/win!!!"
4,Great Christmas Music,My family greatly enjoys most of the Wee Sing productions. The Christmas set is very good and I appreciate that the types of music are separated. The first half is about the birth of Jesus and the second half has lots of Santa music. We can listen to what we want to hear without constantly skipping individual songs.
3,Meh.,"Was hoping for more cute Wee Sing music, but my kids didn't care for most of it as it's lots of adult singing and it really doesn't sound that great."
3,write a book to pay for your home redo,"was drawn in by the lovely living room on the cover. after going through book, found that most rooms and ideas were of the author's new home, which limited the number of ideas offered for those of us with different style homes. also,on closer inspection, curtain details, etc. were not especially orginial or inspirational. in all, the cover photo is the best thing about this book."
4,"Nice, no frills watch","I am very pleased with the watch. It is very understated, attractive, not cheesy or clunky. Very slim, nice band (very different). only thing i would like to change is the addition of a date window."
5,great,"I have purchased this watch and I'm really very pleased wearing it. Design is fantastic, works great, no problem. Looks nice on hand. I recommend you all this item."
2,Beautiful but very fragile,"As other reviews I saw before I bought this product, its a very beautiful watch, but my husband had no more than one month with it and the cristal broke. I wish I had taken more seriously all those warnings from other reviews and bought another watch. It will break, for sure, so I don't recommend it at all."
1,Poor Quality Watchband,"I liked the slim line feature which is why I originally purchased this watch. However, the band disintegrated after about 7 or 8 months of use. That, in itself, wouldn't be so bad but the replacement band including shipping and handling costs almost as much as the watch itself. Maybe superglue would work!"
5,I love this watch,"I've worn many different watches but find that the clean design, solid construction, and slimness of this watch are perfect for me. Unlike many cheaper watches you might find, the strap is large enough to fit my large wrists comfortable. It's good looking and, amazingly, I get compliments on it. My only suggestion for improvement would be a push-on light so I can check the time in the movie theater. :-)"
2,Beautiful watch but quit running on day 2!,"I spent some time reading the reviews and figured I was taking a small risk on the watch easily breakingm but it was a risk I was willing to take at a $64 sticker price. The watch arrived two days ago and I was immediately pleased with the looks and the fit on my wrist. The next day I wore it to work and at the end of the day notice the time was off about 1 hour and had quit running. I shrugged it off and reset the time, pushed the pin back in, and the watch began to run successfully again. Again today around the same time; the watch quit running. I suspect the hands are getting stuck on one another or it's a battery issue. Either way I shouldn't be having these problems on day 2. Thankfully Amazon has a favorable return policy on watches so I'm sending it back and now shopping for a different brand."
1,not reliable at all,I bought this watch and it stopped working a week or so later - had the battery replaced and it worked for aabout a week and then stopped.
4,Cross Section of Friendship,"Well, I guess the underlying message here would be that what one thinks of their friends and friendships may not be the reality of it to the other. In other words, Gemma and Esther's relationship was not what Esther was telling us. In fact, both girls have two seperate realities as to the depth and understanding of their friendship. The author weaves this message into quite a tale of travel, discovery, and tragedy. We are told the story of these two on a trip to India through Esther, who thinks of her self as a world traveler. She takes along her childhood friend Gemma out of guilt. They meet up with other travelers, and so the story unfolds. Esther ends up going back to England alone and distraught. But the story doesn't end there, as Esther has to put closure to losing Gemma five years later.This is a great read and quite entertaining."
3,Creepy Good but something's missing,"I agree with everyone else - the book was interesting. I couldn't put it down and couldn't wait to find out what happened to Gemma. But in the end, I felt a little cheated. Somehow, the ending just didn't seem realistic, but that's just my review..."
1,Never got this to work,"Beware of outdated OS and drivers that won't load. I donated it to Good Will. I read the reviews, some people could get it to work."
2,Not happy with Country Living magazine,"I have been a long time subscriber to Country Living but the magazine has changed to the point that I no longer recognize it. I always looked forward to the beautiful pages showing homes decorated in ""country"" fashion. I know that the country look is not as it once was but neither should the magazine take on the modern look it now has."
2,"Interesting idea, but my cat doesn't seem to care for it...","While this toy seems like a pretty interesting idea, I have to say my cat at least, a nine year old tabby, didn't seem to care for it at all, meaning I just wasted money on trying to entertain him. =\However that's not to say kittens wouldn't like this toy, because I can see merit in its design. It's a glove you wear to protect your hand, and the little mice and toys dangle from the fingers for the cat to attack. My cat did play with it, but only for about 30 seconds.I think the main drawback is that the mice sit there, idle, until the cat reaches for them to pull them down. Otherwise, it's static, unless you yourself pull the mice down in front of them. Perhaps if this were a more hi-tech glove, there'd be raise and lower buttons in each of the fingers to give control, to create movement and entice the cat into playing, but that would be a much more expensive glove."
1,would not work,After several attempts to get help from Iogear I finally gave up and bought a wireless printer. Iogear support basically acted as though I were stupid!
2,We've had a lot of problems with it,"We got this print server so we could add a printer to our home network. We installed the printers' drivers on the print server and it worked for about a week. We ended up having to reinstall all the drivers and reconnect all the computers to the print server. About another week later, we had to redo it again. We called the manufacturer, and they recommended doing the same thing that I had already done and had no other solution. This device has been nothing but a problem -- it does not stay connected to the network."
1,Sharing equals one at a time,"I bought this product so that 4 computers could share one printer. Technically they can, you just have to logoff one computer before another can log on. Something as simple as printing takes 3 steps. 1) Disconnect another connected computer. 2) Connect your computer. 3) Then Print. This product is a waste of money."
3,Flakey print server,"As advertised the print server sounded great. However, in practice it is a bit annoying. First off, setup on windows vista/7 is simple. The most difficult part is getting the correct print drivers if the printer wasn't already installed on the machine you wish to print from. I could not get it to work with the latest version of MacOS X, snow leopard. Snow Leopard has moved to a different print set up and I could not associate the print drivers with the print server. The Mac says all is good, but no output, while the windows machines are able to print fine. Finally, the thing just hangs sometimes. When this happens unplugging the print server and plugging the ac back it makes it work just fine. But this is required far too ofter."
2,"Works, but is problematic","I have this hooked to my Canon ink jet printer, using static IP on my network. Sometimes it does not finish printing pages completely and I have to send another one thru to get the first one to finish printing. Kind of a waste of paper, but for the low price what do you expect? Also be warned it is not bi-directional so your print driver may throw errors that it cannot detect ink levels."
1,Unreliable,"I found that my HP LaserJet 1012 printer was no longer supported after upgrading to Windows 7, and even though I found a workaround that allowed my Windows 7 machine to use it, I could not share the printer on my home network with Windows XP clients. So, I bought this unit to host my printer on the network. Initially, upon setup, I was able to use it with all clients. However, it has now been installed for a few months and I've found that I often need to power cycle the unit and sometimes reboot the computer, too, in order to make it work. I'm now outside of the return window, so that's $38 wasted."
1,GPSU21 - Windows 7 - POS,"Have tried to get this thing working on windows 7 64 bit for 3 days now with no luck. IOGear's ""live"" chat is worthless, been number 1 in the cue for 3 hours with no answer (presently 12:30 MST). Time to return this piece of junk."
3,Did not work with my Lexmark MFP.,Found out after calling the tech support. Found out after calling the tech support. Found out after calling the tech support.
1,Support is horrible,"I've had this print server for a few years and it was working fine, but when I got a new router it could no longer recognize my printer. I tried everything to fix it (I used to work in IT so I have a decent understanding of TCP/IP, etc.) and finally decided to call tech support. The support guy was so unbelievably rude and condescending that I'm just going to buy a print server from another company. I don't ever want to deal with ioGear again."
4,Questions?,This is a highly recommended film. I enjoy it from the moment it introduces itself to the end statement. This is one that any film critic or buff should watch and any Shakespeare enthusiast needs to see.
5,If Shakespeare was influenced by Monty Python,"One of the funniest and most intelligent movies EVER.Highly recommended to any Shakespeare fan or someone looking for an intelligent, thought provoking comedy.Tim Roth and Gary Oldman are amazing as is Richard Dreyfuss.It's fascinating to see how Tom Stoppard integrates the movie and the play ""Hamlet"". A must see."
5,"Smart, funny, touching, and should be widely available","A smart adaptation of Tom Stoppard's early play with excellent acting. A thoughtful and funny and touching sideways view of the ""depressed aristocrat"" in Denmark from the point of view of two minor characters (as are we all in the lives of the rich and famous). Articulate, witty, and always interesting interpretation. Needs to be in wide distribution, especially now that Wm Shakespear has been ""discovered"" by hollywood."
3,Bizarre but fun,"A wacky little movie that's just strange enough to be entertaining. Great cast and surreal treatment of Shakespeare's characters. I would imagine some people would love this while others might hate it. Hard to judge, but if you're a Shakespear/Hamlet buff, you definitely should see it."
5,Hilarious!,"This has extra features that are fun. Again, a hard to find release that is a great companion to the play."
5,stoppard is brilliant,"Stoppard is a brilliant playwright, who is finally getting noticed by Shakespeare in Love. Lets all hope that the success of that movie will lead to the release of this classic on Video. Write the studio and tell them to let R & G go free!"
2,Just not gripping,"Admittedly the film is clever and the acting is good and it has it's moments of entertainment, BUT overall it's long and pretty boring. It seems it would have been better suited as a play, which apparently it was originally. I had just finished re-reading Romeo and Juliet when I rented this, thinking I was still in a Shakespeare mood, but this didn't do it for me. I suppose if I had just finished reading or watching Hamlet, it would have been better. My favorite parts are Oldman's silent scientific discoveries, completely amusing. Couldn't wait for the movie to end, honestly."
2,"Interesting premise, boring execution","My wife is a huge Shakespeare fan and didn't know about this movie. I had seen it before but wasn't too up to date on Hamlet to really appreciate. Well we just saw the Branagh version (a must see) and rented this. Unfortunately it is still boring, which is really too bad since I think the premise is very interesting. As I read all the reviews I wonder if I have seen the same video these other people have. Roth, Oldman and Dreyfuss are good, but the people who are playing the other ""minor"" characters from Hamlet seemed like they were sleepwalking through their parts. I liked the verbal tennis match, but for the most part it seemed like Stoppard was trying to out-Shakespeare Shakespeare. I bet this works better on the stage, but it certainly does not work on the movie screen."
1,perfectly boring,"Probably most pretentious and pompous film I ever watched - pseudo-comedy stuffed with pseudo-intellectual jokes. I hoped it was a good movie since it got such high rating and even won Best Picture at the 1991 Venice Film Festival. Perhaps somebody is amused by watching for five minutes how a coin is being tossed and always falls heads up, while one of the actors (to a complete amusement) would repeatedly say ""Heads!"", or somebody else finds outrageously hilarious when tennis match is theatrically transformed into rhetorical duel. - Yet this film is a perfect example of unmitigated bore - synthetic play of artificial art."
4,Nostalgic,I loved the variety of artist on this album. A lot of familiar tunes and some I never heard before.
4,Works well,"This item is ""no frills"" --basic black and smells a bit of the oil used when the threads were cut. But it works fine to mount a microphone gooseneck to a speaker's podium."
4,Teenage Facism in Australia,"This book is an interesting true life story of the small and peculiar world of extreme right wing politics. Through the narrative of Greason we are shown a world of incredibly insecure people who strangely enough think they have something to offer Australia. Just be thankful the world these people live in will never become reality. Greason has offered a view which is disturbing, but at the same time rather comical and personable."
2,Outdated and not worth the price,"Echoing what a number of other reviewers have noted, the reality in Taiwan is substantially different than what is portrayed in this book. It may have been more accurate 30-40 years ago, but Taiwan has changed substantially (politically, economically, and socially) in the interim and either the authors have not bothered to update their experiences or they themselves are stuck in the past. I found little of value in it and my wife, a native of Taiwan, found it cartoonish, laughable and occasionally offensive."
3,Exagerates things a bit,"I just want to throw my vote in with several others who have commented on how this book gives an impression that is more harsh than the reality. It tends to give the worst case scenarios regarding how Taiwanese treat foreigners, which I think gives people the wrong impression. In my experience the Taiwanese are mostly curious but friendly, except in Taipei where foreigners aren't a novelty and are pretty much treated like anyone else. Yes, a white person will be stared at quite a bit, and may get some blunt questions that would be considered rude elsewhere, but the types of really blatant disrespect this book describes is pretty unlikely.Other than that, it is useful and informative as to customs, etc, though I don't think one has to be quite as picky about issues of ""face"" as the book suggests, especially with the younger generation."
1,Didn't recieve,I never recieved this product. I was charged for it anyway so had to dispute it on my credit card.
4,Webkinz site is full of great games,"My 5 year old likes the dog, but she LOVES the webkinz site. She has built a mansion for her dog and tends to it daily. The games are fun for her. We now have to limit her computer time, because she would stay on Webkinz all day long."
5,"If you aren't already going to buy it, try the demo","If you are stuck on whether or not to buy this game...download the demo, it will definatly make you want to buy it"
4,Very funny game,"This game is so good. However, I felt a little disappointed because I expected better graphics. The jokes have made me laugh so many times. If you like the previous version (Curse) then you must love this new one. By the way, it's important to note that a 3d graphic accelerator card was supposed to be needed, but I have seen this game running smoothly on computers with generic AGP 8MB video cards. I even didn't note the difference between the graphics on my computer (TNT2 Riva 32 MB) and some friends's computers (those generic non-3d accelerated cards). So if you are interested and you don't have a 3d graphics card, I recommend you to download the demo and judge by yourself if you can play EFMI or not. In my opinion this game is excellent, but it's not better than the previous version."
5,LucasArts has done it again!,"It's about time! After seeing the diminishing number of grpahic adventures over the past 5 years, it's great to see LucasArts is not ditching the category that made it famous. Seeing that The Curse of Monkey Island is the best computer game in the last ten years, at least, this game will no doubt blow us all away!"
3,More Monkey Fun,"This game was very cute and a good follow-up to the last game. We did experiance technical difficulties with the game, but in the end got it to work just fine. The humor is a little different than the last game, and there wasn't enough Murray in it in my opinion, but the puzzles were still of the same quality as the last game. I thought the game was very easy to control. People have just gotten too used to the mouse. Don't listen the them. This game was easy to use."
1,escape from monkey island,Playing the Sims in German is better than playing this game. Talk about convaluted. Save your money on this one. Art work and graphics are it's only savers.
1,How horrible!,"I have bought and played all the Monkey Island games before this, so I was excited to buy the newest fourth edition in the series. To my great disappointment though, they have changed too much. The graphics were great, but did they really need to make it in 3D format. Maybe I got a bugged disk but when I would use the pg Up buttom (or down) it wouldn't highlight the sentence I wanted to pick. Also, since you are not able to use a mouse, it takes him FOREVER to get anywhere. You need to walk in just the right space to get sentences to choose from...the list goes on and on. I am taking this back to the computer store tomorrow. Why couldn't they just make it mouse compatible. I would of really enjoyed the game!"
3,Are you all psychic?,How can you have 12 reviews of a game that hasn't come out yet? Did any of you review Sierra's Gabriel Knight 3 this way too?
5,Practical Guide For Caregivers,"Knittweis and Harch have produced a very practical, readible, well-organized ""how to"" guide for alzheimer caregivers. Topics such as dealing with daily activities, safety issues, common medical problems, and caregiver stress are addressed in a straight foward question-and-answer format. Also included is helpful information about alzheimer disease centers, support groups, useful patient products, legal support, and guidance on choosing a nursing home. I believe this book will be a valuable guide for anyone dealing with this difficult problem."
5,love my watch,i love my new fossil watch. it is exactly how i hoped it would be. it has a nice fit and style and was perfectly represented by it's photo online. i received it quickly and i think it is of good quality.
4,Names speak for themselves,It's a fossil what else needs to be said...as long as it arrives in good condition and on time...THERE SHOULD BE NO PROBLEM WITH THIS PURCHASE
2,"Great at first, then disaster","I use my MP3 player to travel and workout in the gym. At first I was very impressed with the unit, then I noticed the battery life went from about 4 hours to maybe an hour. Good luck finding a replacement battery without paying more then you did for the unit. Then the ear plug jack went bad, first I only could hear left side audio then nothing. This unit has a lot of potential, but not there yet, also not very durable. I would recommend it if you only want your MP3 player for about a year, but if your looking for long term go somewhere else."
2,Player will not last long,"When the X5L works, it works great. If you purchase one, expect it to last about a year if you're lucky. Cowon customer service is horrendous. Getting them to help with issues is very difficult and communication is not the best. Overall, this is a risky buy. You may get a player that lasts for a year, but the chances of it becoming non-operational are very good, and the chances of getting it repaired are not good at all."
2,Useless Product,This fan doesnt cool my computer at all. It is too expensive. I bought a cheaper fan that cools my computer much better. I'm ready to throw this fan away.
1,Too small,"The product dimensions says it is 13"" wide. It is only 11 1/2, so it did not fit my lap top. I wrote eforcity and asked for a replacement if they had one or at least to be reimbursed for shipping since the product was not as described. Got no response for a week. Finally wrote again and got a form letter saying my return would be processed in 9 to 13 days, no offer to refund shipping."
1,Bad Product,"This product is bad, I don't recommend its purchase, the reader of cards and hub usb they don't respond when they are connected more than a peripheral, the service for Amazon is Good, Thank you"
3,Wonderful book!,"This is a wonderful book that is heavy on the history of Syracuse China. Although it does have some info on the different patterns, I was hoping for less history and more pattern information and samples. The book arrived quickly and was safely packaged. Thank you for an excellent transaction."
1,Defective,"I currently live in Nepal and have no access to hot showers so I thought this product would be perfect. I bought it online, had it shipped to my family who then spent a small fortune sending it to me. When I filled it with water the very first time all of a sudden water started coming out of the side. There was a one inch hole in the seam. This product was defective from the start and now I have no way of returning it. Needless to say I'm very disappointed."
2,solar shower is a dud,"Disappointed in solar shower results... apparently it requires more solar energy than we get in Seattle, Wa....oh well, I'm currently on camping trip and won't be able to return within return policy time period..also I am shipping it back home as it is wasted weight on my trip...would not recommend unless more sun is available..."
3,Doesn't fit just right!,The top latch appears to be to narrow for the Nokia E71. Which is the world's best smart phone! It does hold the phone though and is made of durable plastic!
2,Non-toxic vinyl?,"I didn't purchase this but am wondering how this product could be ""non-toxic"" if it is made out of vinyl (PVC)? Vinyl is known for having pthalates, lead, dioxin, chlorine, plasticizers and other chemicals. The vinyl stability ball I recently received as a gift says the chemicals in it are known to cause birth defects and reproductive issues. I am pregnant and definitely don't want to be inhaling these or getting them on my skin; but even if I wasn't, I'd look for other products - maybe those made with rubber instead of vinyl."
4,Awesome ball ; Ok video,"The balance ball was easy to blow up (with some help). It took me a while to get used to it without falling off, but that's expected I guess.The VHS tape was extremely slow, as in it took forever for the tape to teach you the exercises. It really put me to sleep. But once I learned the exercises, I had no use for the tape. It was good in learning some basic exercises with the ball, but it definitely was a pain to sit through.Anyway, the balance ball is great for any exercise routine and this one is no difference. I've had the ball for a few months now and it hasn't deflated that much, even with kids jumping all over it at family parties. It's held up great and I'll continue to use it whenever I exercise."
3,"high-quality ball, but small","I got the medium-sized ball and thought it would be big enough (I'm a 5'7"" female) but it seems to be too small. The ball seems sturdy, and the material is thick. The pump, however, is really poorly made plastic and looks like it will break after a few uses. The DVD that comes with this kit is a good introduction to the balance ball and has some basic exercises and stretches, but you'll definitely want to get another DVD."
2,No quality,The blender it self didn't work very good so sorry I purchased it. The mugs are OK but a few of the tops didn't screw on as easy as they should have. Save your money and buy a better blender/mugs
4,great replacements for the one that broke,These are great for my back 2 basics blender. I only wish they had rings that went around the top of the cup so that I didn't have to use the lid on them.
3,"OK, but not substantial enough.","While most of his premises seem quite reasonable, a lot of them don't seem to be developed enough to be thouroughly convincing. As someone who counsels people I find his case histories much too brief to be of great use. Perhaps my perception suffers because I recently read the Handbook of Christian Apologetics by Peter Kreeft (5 Stars in my book). I feel like I've gone from Shakespeare to Reader's Digest."
3,Not the real thing.,I've purchased plenty of Phiten Titanium Necklaces from stores such as Sports Authority and they aren't made like this one. They're better quality. This seems to be some kind of knockoff even though it almost looks the exact same.
4,titanium necklace,This was a present for a teenager that he requested. Arrived on time and it was what he wanted.
3,same back up band?,I'm really surprised that no one bothered to mention in their reviews if this is the same backing band with Les Claypool from Primus and Danny Carey from Tool? Please respond asap if someone knows!
2,Not a Happy Camper,"I ordered this thinking that it would be nicer than showering in some of the drafty campground bath houses. I thought it would be perfect not to have to walk to and from the showers in the cooler weather. No wonder I have not seen this in use where we camp. It was very flimsy, not good quality and difficult for two adults to set up.We assembled it one time at our house and realized it was not what we thought.We may never actually use it. Unfortunately, I had allowed the return window to close prior to convincing my husband to help me set it up.Money wasted as far as I am concerned.You can probably build something similar using PVC and couplings."
1,poorly built,"had this for 1 week, it fell over and the support brace fell top brackets fell apart. This is made with cheap plastic and will not last. The wind also ripped the fabric. Its in the trash now. Terrible quality."
2,Broke on second use...,"This was great while it lasted. Unfortunately, it didn't last very long. On second use, in moderate winds at Coachella, the plastic parts that hold the poles together snapped. We duct taped it to get through the weekend, but it will not be used again. I guess it would be fine for camping in perfect weather. But would not take it to the coast."
5,Great Privy!,"I've purchased a couple of other Shower/shelters over the last few years to use as a privy when camping. They ended up in the local charity box because they just didn't do what they said they would. I can't tell you how many times I've been in one `doing my business' when a light breeze came up and toppled the darn things, even when they were staked down (if they had that option)!!!! This one, finally, will be the last one I need to buy. For one thing, its size is perfect and easy to set up, now granted I use it only as a privy shelter, I mean really who showers when they go camping? But it's large enough for two people to shower in. That said, as a privy its perfect, and combine it with the Reliance Products Fold-To-Go Collapsible Portable Toilet and you've got one hell of a bathroom! I like the added pockets as well, more than enough room for shower items as well as a place to store toilet paper. I highly recommend this shelter, you can't wrong with it, even on a windy day!"
5,Wonderful!,This tent was easy to set up and take down. I love that the floor is removable! I have used it twice and both times it was very sturdy.Received it quickly from the seller!
4,Sturdy and easy to use,This shower shelter is easy to set up and very stable with fly on. An inside towel hanger would be nice. The solar shower included could be a better design. None the less we were thrilled to have it while festival camping with temps over 100.
5,One of the best.,"This is one of Bava's best films as far as I'm concerned. The fact it takes place in the large villa is sweet because the villa is like a giant high-end maze. I saw this film when I was young and I am so glad it recieved the dvd treatment. This movie should be viewed in a full on whooknay, late at night with tight friends who share the same fondness for quality horror. Italy's finest!"
3,ALMOST,"I thought this would be right up my alley....instrumental...HENDRIX flavours.....heavy guitar groove....unfortunately the endresult is never satisfying....I listened to this at least a dozen times, just in case I missed something....it never gets beyond predictable progressions.....no melodies that stick....not a solo that is memorable...yes he can play the guitar, but creates very little in the way of original music.....it's OK, but nothing special.....when you listen to PLANKTON you know how far this idea can be taken....MITCHELL falls well short of these benchmark cd's.....he is a better guitarist than he is a muso as none of his compositions stick in your memory even after repeated listens."
5,PS2 RULES!!!,"THE PS2 IS AWESOME!!! IT IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE GAMECUBE,XBOX, AND XBOX 360. SONY HAS WONDERFUL EXCLUSIVES!!! THE PS3 WILL ALSO BE AWESOME!!! MY PS3 IS RESERVED AND I AM GETTING IT ON LAUNCH DAY!!! HAIL SONY!!!"
5,The new PS2 is worth buying,"My old PS2 died and I faced the dilemma of paying to fix it, replace it, or upgrade. The PS3 is still far too expensive, so I bit the bullet and bought this newer version of the PS2.This slim PS2 blows the old design away!The size is so much smaller and lighter. I keep looking at it and smiling.The discs no longer slide out of the front, but instead the the top pops open. Fewer mechanical things to go wrong with, and it works quite nicely.The addition of the network adapter as a standard feature is easily worth the price of buying this new console over fixing the old console and upgrading the adapter.Reaching behind the console to turn off the system is a thing of the past, as well. Easily turns off and on from the front now.Overall, from a design perspective, this is a vast improvement."
5,Still Fun,"With the flood of ""next generation"" gaming platforms out there, it's nice to find that the PlayStation 2 is still a relevant console for avid and hobby gamers."
5,Excelente precio por excelente equipo.,"Acabo de adquirir este PS2 luego de una infructuosa experiencia con un XBOX 360, el cual no podria durar mas de 30 mins encendido sin recalentarse, recomiendo el PS2 por su confiabilidad y cantidad de titulos disponibles.Luism"
4,Perfectly fine.,As long as you know how to unlock the parental controls ;) And remember to get a memory card so you can save your progress.
5,An AMAZING DISC,"Pure and simple, this disc is haunting and true. Bravo Travis, for showing us a whole new dimension of your amazing talent."
4,Lesson Learned...,"Wrote a review just yesterday stressing my disappointment with this CD. Well, after several listens today while driving I have found the beauty within this CD...Quicksand grows on you, Re-Offender is impossible not to sing along to, Beautiful Occupation is just amazing the more listens, and, Happy To Hang Around is my favorite track. Yes, the lyrics have strayed from their norm on some songs, and, yes, the voice sounds a bit different and somewhat Tim Booth-ish (James) on some tracks...still an amazing voice. Just incredible! Rather than Sing, Sing Sing...my advice would be Listen, Listen, Listen and soon you'll be singing along."
3,"A lot better than some stuff, but...","In my opinion Travis has been going downhill since ""The Man Who"". The Invisible Band was still quite good, but this has slipped below the standards I was expecting. Their first album wasn't any good either."
4,We bring the meaning to events in our lives...,"That's the core message -- and starting point -- of Scott Sheperd's new book attacking what he calls the ""stress myth,"" the popular belief that stress is some mysterious force that we cannot control, only manage.Sheperd refuses to buy into that theory, and quickly shows how absurd most modern conceptions of stress really are. In a no-bull, plain-speaking style, he shows readers how they can overcome the sense of overwhelm and frustration that ""stress"" creates. His ideas are not the mere pie-in-the-sky, think-positive-and-it's-all-good ideas, but truly useful approaches that anyone can use to enjoy life more each and every day.One of the best self-help gems of 2002, WHO'S IN CHARGE? is a must-read for those seeking sane, sensible ideas to conquer the stress and control their own lives."
3,Atlas version of the Rand-McNally fold-out paper map,"This spiral-bound atlas is the book form of the Rand-McNally fold-out paper map (not to be confused with the EasyFinder laminated map, which has less coverage). Over half the pages are dedicated to the street index. One inch equals a half mile in this atlas, versus .7 mile to the inch on the fold-out paper version.The atlas format makes it hard to get a ""big picture"" perspective of New York, but this format will be ideal for those locating minor residential streets in the outer boroughs. There is nothing here on commuter trains or the subway; this is not for tourists. Tourists will be better served by the hard-to-find ""Hagstrom 5 maps in 1"" fold-out map (not the atlas)."
5,A book you can't put down. Vivid passion!,"The Spiller's Indian Summer is a book you can't put down. The dual layout of the Spillers' activities was so riveting. One is thrust through the story by its suspending, episodic technique. The passion is vivid and the supporting detail so literal. It makes the characters and images seem so genuine. The novel is beautifully developed throughout to its climax."
4,Great DVD,"It can be a little cheesy at times, but overall its a good way to prepare your body for labor and stay physical. Good mediation at the end."
2,Not for the yoga beginner,"The exercises in this workout are very short. Also, they are not explained. You need to sit through and watch several times before you can even try to do them. If you have never done yoga before, do not waste your money."
1,"too much talk, very annoying instructor","i did not like this workout at all, the yoga i do in clubs and with other tapes is so much better...Shiva is annoying with the voiceover, I mean, it is tooooo strange to do a video while the instructor does not talk to cmaera, that is sooooo weak and unprofessional, she should at least rehearsed her lines then shoot the video. This is terrible~!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Relaxing,"This is a nice DVD. I am the mother of a 15 month old and very rarely find this amount of time to relax and do yoga. This DVD is broken up into segments so if you only have 15 minutes, you can still do it."
3,Nice and easy intro to yoga,"If you haven't done yoga before, this might be the perfect tape for you - good explanations of the poses and paced to be accessible for a newcomer. However, I practiced Bikram yoga for two years before getting pregnant, and I found this tape to be pretty tame."
5,A must have!!!,"I don't typically write reviews, but I am now 7 months pregnant and have been using this video since about week 10. I have to say I could not live with out it. It is addicting! With all of the aches and pains of being pregnant, this video actually cures them. (Temporarily of course) When my back and hips hurt, this video is what I turn to, rather than my husband for a back rub. I feel so good doing this workout and even better afterward. The instructor is mildly annoying, but worth the annoyance for great streching and toning."
4,Wonderful!,"I really enjoyed this video. When I finish, I always feel refreshed and energized. The stretches are good and very appropriate for pregnancy. Before becoming pregnant, I attained a fairly advanced level. I stopped practicing around 9 wks because of ""all day sickness"". I'm just picking up again in the third trimester. I had no trouble following the video and getting back into it. I liked the 3 different models showing different modifications. I didn't like that each model was specifically for a trimester. I wish it took more of a ""do what feels right"" approach. Many of us can still do most of the postures with no or small modifications. The tape assumes in trimester 3, all you can do is sit in a chair and put your arm or leg out. The relaxation at the end is fantastic. The modifications here are completely appropriate to enhance circulation for each trimester. All in all, it's a good pregnancy workout. It's great for anyone who wants to continue yoga practice through pregnancy."
5,Good throughout entire pregnancy,"I tried this tape for the first time this morning. I've been doing yoga for years and was very impressed to see the moves tailored specifically for pregnancy in each trimester. The instructor gives first trimester instruction, and then there's a lady who shows 2nd trimester moves, and another who does 3rd. trimester moves. The moves were easy to follow. Lots of emphasis put on breathing, and lots of squat/pelvic opening moves that are supposed to help get us ready for labor."
2,Not great for first time yoga-ers,"I'm sure this would be good if you were into yoga before your pregnancy, but it was terrible for me. I had read that this was easy and definitely feasible in pregnancy for us non-yoga folks. I only did this DVD twice, and both times was violently ill afterward (not even making it through the whole workout). My pregnant body just did not want to be doing yoga. I really wanted to stick it out, hearing the benefits of yoga in pregnancy, but found that other prenatal aerobics worked much better for me. The prenatal yoga section in Leisa Hart's FitMama was a lot more on my level as a beginner in yoga."
1,"too yoga'ish for me, can't stand the instructor","i've done many videos with many instructors, and Shiva has to be one of the worst, very impersonal. This entire workout is too much, it may relax some, but it would make me want to nap instead of working out since i got so bored with her, i suggest something else, like MBC Yoga by Leisa Hart."
4,Really solid workout,I really enjoy this video. I find it to be as challenging (in terms of toning) and relaxing as you make it. The more I do it- the more I am able to deepen my streching and my breathing.
2,Best for the unitiated,"I had a fairly regular bikram and ashtanga yoga practice before I got pregnant--so I was reasonably fit and flexible to start with. I got scared away from exercising for several weeks, and I lost several pounds during my first trimester, so when I got back in I was a little worried over how much muscle atrophy I had suffered. That being said, this DVD was still way too easy for me. I could only recommend this to someone who has never or rarely exercised and needs something very gentle to get into the exercise habit. If you are an experienced yogi or other athlete, you will be disappointed."
3,only for novices,"This is a very, very basic video. If you have any experience with yoga, look elsewhere. This workout is more frustrating than helpful. The poses are extremely easy. The instruction lags behind the poses on the screen, and Shiva Rea is just too much at times."
2,Not good set up,"I am a beginner from the yoga point of view, I have attended some sessions on my own and generally i think the exercises are OK.My review is not positive as i think the meditation is not good/long enough, besides there is no clear split between it and the next session.Overall the DVD is not organized, it is like homemade! You cannnot select what you want from a main screen you need to press forward and CHASE the moment....The pity thing is a read comments like that and I still bought it, dont understimate the importance of it more if you are not exactly a patient person and you are looking for relax, this doesnt help."
4,"Good for prenatal exercise, but not real yoga","The exercises aren't real hard core yoga, but I suppose I can't do much true yoga for now, being that my belly is in the way. Shiva Rea incorporates stretches that are good for pregnant women, including those that will help in labor, although this isn't really explained. I love that there are three ladies in different trimesters demonstrating."
3,prenatal yoga,This video was good - i wish there were a few different routines instead of just the one.
3,Better Than Nothing,"I got this DVD recently (after reading other Amazon reviews). I've done the whole workout several times. It's okay especially for beginners, but it doesn't really push you like a live class does. Someone else mentioned that the way Shiva says ""exhale"" can be annoying. Yes, it is extremely annoying. I am glad I have the DVD, because on rainy days or days I am not attending a yoga class, I at least have an alternative. It's better than doing nothing."
1,"horrible video, decent exercises, but instructor is bad","i liked some of the moves in this video, but it was terrible to have a voiceover by the instructor. I couldn't stand that! I'd rather do my FitMama video, and will trade this as soon as I can."
2,not that impressed,"I thought that I would love this video b/c of the reviews for it. But I found it a little bit too slow and boring, and not very challenging at all... it was alot of stretch and very little strength and I'm used to having a good combination of both from the yoga vids that I've done in the past. Unfortunately i'm very inflexible, and it's ever so tough to try to become more flexible which being pregnant so this video hasn't really gotten very much use of it. Also, someone else mentioned that the way she pronounces ""exhale"" is really weird and annoying... I thought the person who made that review was rediculous at first, and looking for things to pick at - but I was wrong... it was very annoying..."
5,87chevy,I purchased 3 different prenatal videos when I first found out I was pregnant. I ended up only using this one on a consistent basis. Shiva Rea has a calming voice and explains each pose as well as creating modifications for each phase of pregnancy which is great for those of us who have never done yoga before! The poses assisted in the aches and pains that come with pregnancy and kept me limber. I highly recomend this video to those who may not be used to working out on a consistent basis or just need a good stretching and calming break in your day!
4,Great for stretching!,"This is a great video. I am in my second, going on my third trimester, and really love all the stretching. Especially as your posture changes during pregnancy, this helps keep your back flexible. However, if I were still in my first trimester, I would supplement this with a slightly more intense yoga or workout. You don't burn a whole lot of calories doing this."
2,low-impact,"this yoga routine is entirely too short and entirely too easy. i didn't feel like i got anything out of it at all. it wasn't even very relaxing. i realize a strenuous workout isn't the point of yoga, but it was barely more movement than lying on a couch..."
1,Not the same as I what I received,"I did receive a pregnant yoga DVD, but it was not the same one that was advertised in the picture or descriptionPrenatal YogaThis is what I received"
3,Not too annoying,"I really liked this lady, and felt like I would like her in person too. She was very kind and didn't seem unrealistically perfect, or act annoyingly spiritual or mystical about everything. The outfits were not very flattering, but overall this was a good yoga workout. I'm not a super big fan of yoga, but this was way better than the other yoga DVD I tried (yoga for your pregnany with kristen eykel). Still Denise Austin's fit and firm pregnancy is my all around favorite."
2,"Boring, simple workout","I was very disappointed in this workout. I am in my second trimester and felt that modifications were a bit ridiculous. I went through the workout once, but really felt that it was a waste of time. I wanted to do yoga and not slow, boring stretches. I found a better prenatal yoga series for free on youtube. I think I might enjoy this at the very end of my pregnancy, hopefully."
2,Sort of blah,I bought this one and Dr. Laurie Anderson (which is very good). I thought Shiva Rea was not that challenging. I have seen the same moves on other pregnancy DVDs. But it is a good one if you do not do a lot of yoga. Anderson's was just better and you can still do Anderson's even if you do not regularly practice yoga.
3,I bought this DVD & The Divine Mother Prenatal Yoga Series with Anna Getty,"I bought the two DVD's, and started the Shiva Rea one first. It is a nice DVD, but once I did The Divine Mother Prenatal Yoga Series with Anna Getty, Wow! it was much better for me. Very pleasing, and not as strenous as the Shiva Rea. I do recommend it, if you want a second video."
3,Good for a Beginner,"I am a runner who practices yoga. I bought this video because I wasn't sure if all the yoga poses I was familiar with were safe for my growing baby.I'm used to a more intense workout and I found this video to be boring. You can break it up by the sections, but if you want to do the whole workout it takes over an hour and there is no challenge at all. The instructor holds the poses for only a few seconds so you barely get any stretch from it.It also got on my nerves that she pronounced the word ""exhale"" as ""eck-ssale."" She says it over and over again and it made it hard to focus on what I was doing.I recommend this video if you're a beginner at yoga and excerising, but if you have any experience and are looking for a workout I'd try something else."
3,Good for people who already do yoga,"I already had some (but not a lot of) experience doing yoga, so I recognized the moves in this prenatal yoga tape. But I wouldn't recommend that pregnant novices go into downward facing dog w/o any detailed instruction (as she does in this video). That doesn't seem safe. Also, the instructor moves too quickly from one pose to the next--seemingly forgetting that she's asking pregnant women, who can be slow and off-balance--to move quickly. I like this DVD but I wish she'd slow down a little."
3,Not bad...,"I'd consider myself a beginner at yoga. I've done it off and on for about a year and a half. I am pretty satisfied with this DVD. I am almost 7 months pregnant and find the breathing and stretching beneficial. The DVD seems quite mellow, but I think that is because the women doing the yoga are not the ones speaking, there's a voice over. I can see how others who have been doing yoga for years would find this DVD too slow and boring. For me, it's just what I need right now. Having the 3 different women in different stages of pregnancy is helpful. I also like that it's broken into 15 minute segments so you can do what you have time for or what you are in the mood for. Overall, this isn't a bad investment for someone who is a bit less experienced in yoga."
3,"Yoga is good, disappointed with the product","I bought the Baby Ready Yoga kit with included pre natal and postnatal yoga. I was disappointed when I bought this DVD to find it cracked but not affecting the playability of the disc, and more disappointed when it's the same exact dvd included in the baby ready yoga kit. I paid 12.99 for this but I paid 19.99 for the baby ready which includes a thick mat, belt, block, pre and postnatal workout plus brainy baby dvd sampler. I have nothing against the program, it may be own fault too not researching about the product better."
1,Not yoga just stretching,"This isn't really yoga as I've experienced it. When I leave my prenatal yoga class I am sweating and I get a good workout. There wasn't any sun salutations or ""flow"". It was just 70 minutes of gentle stretching. If you are looking for a work out this isn't it."
3,So-So Pregnancy Yoga Dvd,"This is an ok pregnancy yoga dvd. However, I would have preferred that the video chapters were divided by trimester. Instead, the dvd is broken out into yoga routines. So, if you want to do a floor routine, you would need to do that separate from a standing routine--doesn't incorporate them all into a simple routine."
4,Good for stretching,"I use this prenatal DVD when I want a good stretch. To me, it doesn't feel like a yoga session, but more a series of gentle stretches. I am currently 37weeks and do not follow the 3rd trimester model as I wouldn't find it challenging enough (a lot of chair sitting).. But overall the DVD is well adapted for the different levels of prenatal exercise, and you still get the joy of movement, relaxation and stretching, so I would recommend it."
3,not my favorite,"This DVD is just okay. For me personally, I don't like that you need a chair for this practice. Unless you are doing Yoga in your kitchen you have to lug or have someone lug the chair for you. Other than that I like the poses, and Shiva is a good instructor."
4,"Relaxing, Concentrated, Yoga","As a beginner to yoga, I found this DVD to be helpful and informative. I was a little intimidated that maybe I wouldn't catch on, or be able to do the poses, but I found the exercises to be great. The instructor explains each pose along with her demonstration. There are 3, 20 minute sections, so if you don't have time to do the whole video, you can choose 1 or 2 sections to complete. The best part of this video for me is that I can feel stretched, toned, and energized without needing to take a shower afterwards. I would recommend for anyone new to yoga. You will need a chair, a 'yoga block' (I used a book) and a 'yoga strap' (I used a belt)."
2,Shiva Prental,"Save your money and keep looking. I have the Shiva Rea Vinyasa Flow DVD and I like it. But this DVD is a disappointment. If you are a fit pregnant woman who practiced yoga before your pregnancy, don't buy this DVD. It is probably good for a pregnant woman new to yoga - but is very elementary. Your time could be much better spent. For new yoga students, keep looking. Shiva Rea does not explain the poses very well. There must be a better DVD."
4,Wonderful smell,"Of course, the smell of this product and how good it is, is subjective, however, I'll go out on a limb and say that if you're considering this item, you've smelled other similar products & would probably like this. I became familiar with this product when I took a yoga class & teh teacher would rub a bit on my temples during the cool down (corpse pose). The smell was not overpowering; rather it was subtle & very pleasant. My nose just wanted to breath in more and more of the scent. I've not actually owned this product, and so am sad to see that it costs $21 here on Amazon; I've foudn it elsewhere for an average of $25. You don't get much, but I beleive it's not meant as something for your whole body; more for just your temples and/or neck. Hope this review helps."
5,An AOR Essential,"Mama's Boys are an AOR/Hard Rock band from Ireland. If you are looking for the best of their CD's pick up Power & Passion, Growing Up The Hard Way and Relativity. These are their most commercial sounding CD's. Growing Up The Hard Way sounds like the AOR group Survivor and is very well produced. It is essential if you are an AOR collector so don't miss out on this classic."
3,very limited,"This book provides a very broad overview of socal routes. This book needs to be 10 times the thickness. However, it is not a bad way to get general info on climbing spots. I do use this book, but only at home. It is probably better to get site specific books."
3,Too vague to be of much use.,I was not happy using this book. I would strongly recommend finding another source for climbing route info than this vogel dude. All of his books that I have seen are too vague to use. The pix are poor and the route descriptions lacking. Boo!
4,Appears to be a handy book for Presidential history buffs,"I have taken to working historical sites into my vacations, mostly Civil War and, since last year, Presidential sites. My interest in Presidential sites has increased with C-Span's 25th anniversary series on U.S. Presidents. A friend told me about the book and I bought it. I like the format (organized by President) and it has been very useful in helping me plan an upcoming trip into Virginia, with various Presidential related stops. Not that I'd carry it in the car all the time (since there are no Presidential sites here in Wisconsin) but when I'm on one of my road trips, this goes next to the atlas."
2,Presidential Sites,"I found this book far inferior to the Clotworthy book and particularly Brian Lamb's book, both of which I own. The quality of the comments is lacking and the photo quality quite inferior. Maybe this book is well suited for someone not truly interested in Presidential history, but then, would they make the effort to visit these places anyway? A big disappointment."
2,Natural Progesterone Cream,"Did not seem to help my menopause symptoms(ie, hot flashes and night sweats), even when combined with a natural Estrogen (estriol)cream. Also, this progesterone cream did not absorb into my skin very well, in fact it left the area where I applied it a little ""sticky"". One final problem, the container did not dispense the pre-measured amount of cream very well."
1,Let's go make a fertility goddess?????? What the......,"Okay. Sat down to watch this for the first time with my son figuring that it would be good ole' Frosty with a new storyline. Wrong. We got about 5 minutes into it and I realized that someone had hi-jacked a kids character and storyline and replaced it with greeny, pagan propaganda. First, one of the little boys says ""Let's go outside and make a fertility goddess"". I'm like.....what the.....what the ....what is this doing in a kids Christmas time animated classic? Then the fact that Frosty doesn't need his magic hat anymore. Then the obvious corporate knocking message about a snow eliminating spray. That was it. Turned it off and instead put in the original Rankin-Bass classic. This one is going to get hung in the window as a sun catcher, that is all it is good for."
1,"absolutely the worst Christmas, err, i mean, Winter Festival cartoon EVER.",From the stupid plot to the terrible music this dvd is absolutely dreadful. It gives ammo to every conservative that wishes to criticize liberals for being out of touch and godless. Goddess of Fertility? Really?
1,Frosty returns,"This is with out a doubt is one of the worst Christmas movies I have ever seen! My daughter liked it because it had a snowman in it, but that's the only reason. The movie is filled with overdone, unrealistic, trite political issues of the 90's. It was too complicated for a small child to follow and there was barely even a plot. Only get this if your child is in love with snowmen and you've exhausted all other viewing avenues. There was nothing original in this movie that wasn't absurd. The original Frosty is so wonderfully simple, buy that one instead."
4,I Didn't Like It When I First Saw It But I watched It Again and I now Like It!,"I agree that Frosty Returns is definitely not as good as Frosty the Snowman and when I first watched it on TV I was disappointed with it but I have since seen it again and though I still think it's not as good as Frosty the Snoman I actually thought it was dood and I think John Goodman, Jonathan Winters and every other actor who provided their voices were good and I'm glad I watched this cartoon again and gave it a second chance. I originally wrote a 1 star review trashing this and when I rewatched it I realized that it wasn't as bad as I originally thought and that I was too harsh in my review and I have changed my opinion about Frosty Returns!"
3,relationship counseling from the Nth dimension.,"Make that four stars if the subject matter really appeals to you. The book is carefully crafted, and reflects the general care Letham takes with his novels. However the amazing imagination behind it is so well disguised as the mundane that you fail to appreciate it until the end. I miss the in your face strangeness of his previous work."
5,Another Lethem Hit,"In recent months I've become rather obsessed with Jonathan Lethem's work. As She Climbed Across the Table again confirms Lethem's brilliance as a writer, briliantly and seamlessly mixing genres and emotions like no other. I am a painfully slow and deliberate reader and I read this book in one short sitting. Definitely up to Lethem's other works."
4,Not bad,"I didn't expect much from this book, but I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised. The story was interesting, the characters were compelling and the premise, while not uncommon on the street, was a unique idea from which to write a piece of non-fiction.The characterization of the securities industry is right on - and the caricatures are amusing.The writing wasn't always fluid, but overall the story kept my interest and throughout the book, I was eager to find out what happens in the end."
5,A Nuanced Page-turner,"Gary Sernovitz's second novel holds one's interest with a satisfying intensity that loses none of its steam even as the author successfully draws a full and complex portrait of his main character. Kelch is far more fully realized and multi-layered than many a ""linchpin"" character in other books about Wall St. and the larger world of business beyond Wall St. The richness of Sernovitz's prose, first seen in his Great American Plain, is even more rewarding and mature here. May this young writer find a large and enthusiastic audience, so that those of us who love the sheer intelligence of his writing can look forward to more of the same."
2,The Contrarians,"Let me know when this is available on audiotape; busy schedule limits my ""actual"" reading time. Thank you."
3,Definately Outdated,This book is fine if you are just starting out. I found it useful but you'll need more after this. There are many areas where even the un-educated will realized topics are outdated.
3,"Nice idea, but...","Great idea and looks great in the pictures and packaging, however... the handle, when retracted, doesn't really conform to the shape of the collar and stays mostly straight and awkward looking. For the price I paid, $4.99, I can live with that but retail, I think around $20, would be asking a bit much. Also, when you pull on the handle hard enough to make it work, the collar pulls so far away from the neck that an out-of-control dog could probably slip out. Also, the little name tage retainer under the handle tore, rendering itself useless, on the 1st test pull of the handle. Other than that, it's a just another good, sturdy collar."
2,not great,"their leash is great, but not the collar. It frayed very easily and the buckle is very heavy. the handle doesn't retract back all the way and leaves a bulge. it's usable. but i won't be ordering anymore of these nor would i recommend these collars to my friends."
3,This book is ok,"Ive read tons of books on organized crime and paricularly the mafia. The best parts in this book are when Neil Dellacroce and Jimmy Burke are introduced. Burke was played DeNiro in the movie ""Goodfellas"". Maloney does provide great insight into ""that life"". He does fail to mention how John Gotti's lawyer Bruce Cutler ripped into him on the witness stand. This is the trial in which underboss Sammy (The Bull) Gravano fixed and the ""The Tefelon Don"" was acquitted."
1,Careful what you ask for,"My boyfriend got this book and read it. We have not been together since. The author says its a great way to help men commit. After reading it, my boyfriend left me. 5 years of being together, gone in the one day it took him to read the book."
1,Didn't work for my man,My boyfriend of seven plus years read this book two and a half years ago. Still no ring.
1,DO NOT BUY!!,Completely useless. You are basically pulling the collar... the leash only comes out four inches and by then your dog is dangling off the ground because that is how much resistance is needed to make the dang thing pull away from the collar. The thickness of the leash part when not pulled out hangs over the side of the collar making your dog feel like its neck is in of those cone things. Lame lame lame oh and did i say lame?
3,good for purpose,We like the collar for it's purpose. The handle is a great feature! Our dog seems to have springs on her feet. So being able to hold on to something besides her collar herself and choking her is wonderful. BUT! The appearance isn't holding up. The plastic tag inside for her information has worn off completely and just like some of the other reviews... yes it frays. This is an expensive collar for how often it will need replaced in the future.I'm 50/50.
1,The Worst Buy Ever,"I see why they make this phone on a ""Buy one Get one"" plan. Randomly, this phone will lose service even if I'm standing right under a cell tower. It will drop calls and randomly call people. It has a hollow sound to it. The screen gets dust under it easily. The camera is horrible quality and you can't store a lot.Much like other Motorola phones...the charger is flimsy and feels like it will break off. A horrible buy. Go with another phone. I'm on Amazon trying to find a cheap phone to buy to have Verizon switch my plan over to that. I'll be willing to give up the camera in order to get rid of this P.O.S."
4,Good Phone,I don't know what these people are talking about this is a good phone. I had no problems with it at all. I loved it.
1,The worst cell phone I ever had....,This is the most ridiculous cell phone I ever had. The instrument totally hangs while saving numbers. I think the problem is with the speed dial option they have.I strongly advise not to buy this phone if they are not in any suicidal mission!!
1,Worst phone u can ever have,Horrible design.It has too many flaws .Do not take it even if its free. Bad piece.
1,Verizon? Motorola? Is anyone going to recall this phone?,"This phone needs to be recalled! After reading reviews on several sites, I see that everyone is having the same problems I am. I've talked to Motorola and they won't help (talk about lack of customer service and a general bad attitude). Apparently all of us who made the horrible mistake of getting this phone on a contract are stuck with Verizon giving us the same bad phone again and again. Stop the MADDNESS! If a phone won't charge, shuts itself off whenever, is completely undependable - something must be done. I'm very disappointed in both these companies for not stepping up to the plate!"
1,The worst cell phone ever,"We've had this phone for seven months now. After countless trips to the Verizon store, we just got a replacement for the original phone that died. The replacement has all the same problems - bad charger connection, short battery life, dropped calls. And the Verizon Tech Support tried to convince us that all the problems with this phone are our fault. I'm totally disappointed in this phone and in Verizon. Can't wait for my contract to expire, so I can change providers.ps. I also have a Nokia and I love it. Simple, user-friendly, durable."
4,More than cash,"Great recordings, Personal Jesus an all time favourite and Hurt standing almost equally next to it. Should be printed on HQ vinyl though."
5,Great reference,"It is a general description on nearly all vessels of the ACW. Format entry for all vessels including small tugs. I found it to be a great reference for tabletop wargaming the ACW navy period. Many authors of game rules should read this. It lists all the guns and modifications to the number and type of guns during the war. However, early sailing vessels used in the war are lightly covered and can be found in detail in another book for that period."
3,IT WAS A GOOD BOOK.,"IT STRAYED A BIT FROM THE MOVIE'S PLOT, BUT THE ADDITIONS TO IT MADE THE STORY BETTER. OVERALL, IT WAS A PRETTY GOOD BOOK. IT'S NOT THE BEST I'VE READ, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY MUCH BETTER THAN THE WORST. I RECOMMEND IT IF YOU ARE A BIG MOVIE FAN, OTHERWISE, YOU MAY NOT LIKE IT AS MUCH."
1,Desafortunada,"Una de las cosas que me impactó al saber sobre el rodaje de Alexander fue que la música le fuera encomendada a Vangelis, la explicación era obvia: el vínculo del macedonio conquistador con Grecia, y la experiencia de Vangelis en música de películas que tratan sobre conquistadores. Sin embargo, al escuchar la banda sonora, sentí que le falta fuerza y que es un poco estática, destaco que no se escucha la dinámica de una banda sonora de una pelicula sobre un guerrero, es repetitiva y aunque tiene pasajes brillantes, mi opinión es que debio haber sido encomendada esta misión musical a alquien como Hanz Zimmer."
1,they suck,"Everyone who is thinking about buying this CD please listen to #1 and understand that this song sets the standard for the quality of music you will find on this cd. ""Barlow Girls"" is one the songs I hate the most of much of the music I've heard. It's about as bad as Scarecrow and Tinman's ""My Son"". In terms how the music was mixed, the bass and low-end tone of the song is non-present. As far as the lyrics and message? Here it is: ""We are two flamboyant christian chicks trying to preach a message of inner beauty over outer beauty, yet we have outrageous hair-dos, leather pants, skin tight shirts, and 2 lbs of make-up. All the guys want us ['all the boys in the band want a valentine from a barlow girl']"" So basically this sounds like sorority girl music, with a more christianized theme, from a garage band who sound like they recorded their cd on an 8-track in a 2-bit studio."
5,top 10 cd for 03,"There was once a band called 'THAT DOG'.. who's first album was a strange child.. It was beautiful, yet difficult to love.. Some years later 'THAT DOG' released their third (and final) album 'RETREAT FROM THE SUN'. It was (not to put to finer point on it...) PERFECT. Then they split up (I blame their wicked stepmother 'GEFFEN RECORDS'). Anyhoo, I happened acrossSUPERCHIC(K) when I was browsing someones top ten girl band albums on AMAZON and gave them a listen. They embody the spirit of THAT DOG and blend it with the experimentation of ANI DiFRANCO and the disco charm of DEE-LITE.. In short, this band are a breath of fresh air to jaded ears, and this is an essential album for anyone with eclectic tastes."
3,A music fan in NY,"There is some splendid singing on this record particularly from Joan Sutherland. However, the recording quality is far from optimal. This is not of the technical standard of the recording Sutherland did with her husband Richard Bonynge. For this reason I would recommend to stay with the Bonynge version"
5,A special book,"This is one of my favorite ""birth"" books of all. The ideas and wishes are beautiful with attractive illustrations. Purchase this for the someone special--little or big--in your life."
2,Strictly For Fantasy,"Before you buy, make sure you realize this game is strictly from the GM point of view. You don't get to control much of the game, and definitely won't see any. It's great if you want to try to build a team with trades. But that gets old quick, since real evaluation of talent is watching them play."
1,Speakers arent Worth a Dollar,I purchase these speakers and it bursted soon as i installed them. Buy a 60 to 80 Dollar Speaker Because it will be Worth The money plus better bass and quality.
2,nOT ANYTHING new AT ALL,"I am sorry, so many others seem to love this book.It is brief and conciseIt is easy to readIt does have easy to do helpful exercisesIt does explain the mechanics of the knee and how and why exercises will workHowever, there are ONLY 4 exercise for stretching and strenghtening the muscles.You can get all 4 from a GOOD chiropractor or a GOOD PT!!!the other 4 arewalkwalk in waterwalk on a treadmillride a bicycleI do agree all of these work , I have and still am doing all of theseand they do work....................bUT I DID NOT NEED THE BOOK !!!I even did the Amazon look inside this book....boy was I mistaken or should I say taken???The book Get Fit in Bed will give you the same stretches and more as well as strengthen your core muscles...buy it instead and then do the 4 walking to biking exercises I mentioned above."
4,Beautiful Flatware,"This solidly-made, lovely set of flatware is weighty and elegant, equally at ease for serving breakfast and a gourmet dinner for The Queen. My only criticism is that the knives are, for me, too rounded at the blade end- I would have wished for a more pointed tip and perhaps a slightly better cuttting edge. Yet, all in all, this is a very useful and satisfying set of cutlery- I like it a lot."
4,great for day-to-day,"If you like this kind of flatware, go with Ginkgo. The cost is very reasonable and the quality is so much better than those you can pick up at, say, Bed Bath and Beyond."
4,better than expected,"i got the white set and was so pleased, i just ordered the blue, as well. i can use the spoons on a hard tub of ice cream and it doesn't bend at all. one of my spoons did come with a few silver scratches on the back, but they're otherwise exactly as pictured. also, shipping was unbelievably slow. i ordered the second set a week ago and its estimated delivery date isn't for another 6 weeks. the first set took about a month."
2,faded plastic,"i ordered this set based on the reviews saying they were a good bang for the buck set. while i agree w/ that assessment, the black plastic portion of the handles were faded as if to appear to have been gently used for a few years. i thought about it for all of an hour and had to return them. i don't mind if something is worn, but i would like to be the one to cause the wear and tear =) i don't know how the other colors appear, but i might pass on the black."
4,Cute Book,This is a cute book with lots of dinosaur names in it so it's a bit educational as well. The illustrations are great. After reading lots of other children's book my only wish is that it had a beat to it to read to as it is about a dinosaur dance but it's still a great book to read to the little ones.
2,Not so good,"When I had this item, the pedals wouldn't work.Sometimes they would for a while, but the they would quit.The brake doesn't work, after I let go of the gas , it immediatly goes into a brake. I wouldn't get this item , I would find a better one."
5,great buy,"great, great book. i was nervous about having to learn to teach a new math program i was not familiar with but this book makes it so easy. i love the ideas, vocabulary words, simple format etc. highly recommend to any preschool teacher"
1,"Conned as well, but Amazon is as much to blame","Acorn repackages the same titles which is plenty sneaky, but Amazon is equally to blame. A list of the titles included in the boxed set should be included in the description. Shame on Acorn and Amazon. What is unfortunate is that I will no longer buy Acorn products because as with the Poirots, they did the same thing with Midsomer Murders and it cost me more than $100 to end up with titles that I already had in other packaging. Also, because of the way the box is packed, you can't tell this until you remove the plastic casing. FRAUDS!"
5,Poirot the movie collection set 2,"I love Agatha Christie detectives and Poirot is the best. If you are an Agatha Christie fan, you will like this set."
5,Track list,1. 6:06 Anstatt das song2. 6:53 This is new3. 6:26 Alabama song4. 4:37 Grabschrift5. 4:00 Mr E.J.6. 6:09 September song7. 7:02 Green up time8. 7:09 Dreigroschen Oper (finale)9. 4:53 Song for my wife10. 3:43 My ship
5,BEST overall book on pricing...Even for the layperson.....,"This book is the best book on pricing..It's all there..formulas..graphs...case studies...examples....the book is kinda pricey (ironically!!..LOL)..But, if you are thinking of pricing your product..it could make you alot fo money in the long run...I 1st got the 1st edition at a thrift shop....This review is for the 3rd edition...I can't afford the 4th edtion yet!!!...oh the irony......"
1,18/10 ????,"What a total disappointment. I've had $12.00 Target/Walmart sets that were more durable and rust resistant. I can't even hand wash these and let them air dry without being over inundated with rust spots. I mean ""rust"" spots, not just discoloration or surface rust kind of thing. These are DEFINITELY not 18/10 Stainless. Nice variety but, that loses its appeal once you actually start to USE this set...SOOOOOOO disappointed and depressing. They also get scratched at the drop of a hat and look 10 years old already. :(Frank"
3,Item is not 18/10 but 18/10,"After receiving this product I knew it was not 18/10 stainless. If that is what you are looking for, this is not it. When I brought it to the attention of the sellar, they would not admit it but asked me to contact mfg. they finally contacted mft...this is not 18/10. If you want a lot of pieces and you know that it is not high quality, then this is a really good set.Sterlingcraft 72-Pc. 18/10 Stainless Steel Flatware and Hostess Set"
3,Product lost in shipment,"I ordered this product but it was lost in the mail. Customer Service acted very quickly on my lost product and credited me back right back right away. Thank you Amazon, I will continue to do business with you."
1,Rockland Supply not selling CoolIT brand!,"Please note that the usb cooler shipped to me by Rockland Supply is not the CoolIT chiller pictured here. I am very unhappy because this was a gift for someone who remembered it from a convention he went to. I've contacted the seller, so we'll see how this is resolved. Do not order this from Rockland if you are looking for the brand pictured."
3,Item is Ok,The cooler keeps a cold drink cooler for slightly longer than without it. It is really nothing like I expected. I thought It would keep a can of cola cold for at least 30 min to an hour and it does not.
5,Excellent Idea Book,We are building a new bungalow and have gotten a lot of ideas here. Everything from window placement to hardware detail is in this book. This book is for anyone who wishes to build or remodel in the arts and crafts style or just add arts & craft details to their home.
5,Greatest Ann Rinaldi ever,"This was the greatest book of all times!! I've read it twice and am planning to start it a third time! Ann Rinaldi painted a clear picture of what it was like for Phillis Wheatley being a slave, and what she had to go thru. The historical information was really acurate!! I would strongly recommed this to anyone. Way to go Ann Rinaldi!!"
3,Obsolete at this point and forget printing - otherwise a good unit,"I have had one of these for years. To be brief:It works fine except the printer port is useless and it only supports 802.11b with WEP.At this point this is an obsolete unit and I am not sure if it would be worth buying today.If you just need a firewall and don't care about the wifi and get one cheap, they would be good for that."
1,"Oh, woe is me!","The author showed a tendancy for too much self-pity in his first book (based on the first half of his AT hike), but in this one he lies down in the middle of the trail and wallows in it. Curran approaches things in a way that is rational, carefully thought out, even scientific. The essence of this book is his efforts to apply this method to figuring out his relationship with God. It's a bit like trying to paint a cloud.For those interested in the actual hiking itself, Curran comes off as a bit too harsh in his judgments of people and businesses he encounters along the way. His comments hint that he often doesn't feel properly respected or treated. I wonder if it has something to do with his being a retired Army colonel, and if he realizes that the world doesn't know or even care about that.Not enough real substance here for my taste."
4,Guide to Milk and Digestion,"One of the most complete books available on the subject--a must-have reference for those who suffer from lactose intolerance. The text explores how to determine how much lactose can be tolerated, what to eat to stave off symptoms, and how to eat out safel"
3,okay product,"This cabinet is what I expected for the price. Not very sturdy. (In fact it arrived damaged. I returned it. The replacement was damaged, but not so much that I wanted to go through the whole return process again.) But it's attractive and useful."
5,meditations on small streams and wild trout,"A well written book about fishing small streams in the southwest, the joys of solitude - in short, a life with quality fishing as one if its foci. Recommended for those with a bent toward fine writing about sport..............."
1,Never received one in working order!,"I was given this item as a gift. I received the item, but due to poor packaging the item had been extensively damaged in transit. I returned the item for replacement, then received another unit a week later. Again, upon opening the box, the unit had been damaged in transit. These are packaged in a cardboard box with no protective foam, bubble wrap, etc. The unit just sits in the box loosely with all of its pieces, vounerable to any mishandling by the shipper. I can't say whether this item works well, but I would not risk purchasing one solely because of the way it is packed and it's likelyhood of getting damaged in transit."
5,perfectly pitched,"With Tom Houses'instructions,you can't miss teaching youngsters the proper way of pitching a baseball."
5,Savages,"I really liked this book. It seemed to me to be very personal, and down to earth. The only thing was how he would not give names-his response would be ""thats not imprtant."" but it really isn't important, A+"
5,Five Stars for Utter Nonsense,"All reviewers are correct -- Michael Savage HAS done it again; that is, he's proven himself to be exactly what America should fear rather than admire. Once one reads this book, they should feel like either a stiff drink or reading something of higher quality, like Archie comics. Anyone who could possibly take this dolt seriously needs to come to grips with reality, and understand that humans shouldn't operate out of fear and anger --especially when your leader is the worst kind of coward, one who hides behind a tough voice on the radio or on the page, then turns tail and runs when the opportunity presents itself.I highly recommend that everyone read this book -- after all, the best way to defeat one's enemy is to know them."
1,Big Disappointment,"This book is a waste of time and money. It is poorly written and the entire book is based on one man's opinion. I am not certain how this book got published. This guy didn't even know if the NAACP existed before WWII. Even the few facts in this book are incorrect. Do the guy really have a PhD? IMHO, Michael Savage is an idiot. I'll use the book as toilet paper."
3,Following in Howard's Foot steps.,"In the vein of Howard Stern, Savage is controversial, outrageous, cynical, and humorous, and like his hero Howard, at times entertaining. The book blames all the worlds ills on the liberals, principally Bill Clinton and Al Gore, and throws in the Republican leadership when it comes to opening the borders to those who don't look like ""us"". The book as well as the show is entertaining, but like with Howard, don't take him too seriously!"
3,Michael Savage does not break any new ground,"Michael Savage does not break any new ground in The Savage Nation. The book reads like a transcript of his radio show, and most of the jokes do not translate well to paper (Larry ""Selzer"" haha). Anyone who has listened to his show more than 10 times would not find anything new in this book. I have no basic disagreement with his message: both the Replicrats and Democrans are selling us out and destroying the country. Savage is at least passionate about his subject, but the material in the book is kinda tired."
2,"Hey Mike, you can do better","The content of course is a product of the Savage mind thus thought provoking and insightful. The editor, however, should be fired. This was like a revisit to 'Frog and Toad' in choppy 8 word sentences and moved like a horse carriage dragging a steel ball and chain. How can a reader take someone seriously who has re-named every person or situation with some sophomoric character dig? As an avid listener and general admirer of Michael Savage my recommendation is for him to stick to radio, or have me write his next book!"
1,This book neglects Mr. Savage's talents.,"Even though I don't share his politics, I looked forward to reading this book because Mr. Savage's credentials are so impressive. Despite his background in health and science, he really doesn't say anything in this book that Rush Limbaugh couldn't say."
1,Yawn - can't I give 0 stars ?,"Boring drivel from right wing. Too bad people like this are allowed freedom of speach - As the president select GWBush said ""There should be limits on freedom."" We need to eliminate this type of stupidity. Trust me - don't pay any attention to the mindless drones that read sh!t like this. It's time to take back the right controlled media."
1,"Suggested Title: ""Insulting Everyone & Everything""","This book contains the most important reasons why even Conservatives from other parts of the world turn their back on America while shrugging their heads. Free speech does not mean insulting everyone and everything that does bear the ""Liberal"" stamp...No wonder that the world's perceptions of the U.S. is declining rapidly..."
1,On Sanity,"Whatever one may think of Michael Savage, through his fans, as we find them herein, we see proof of the relationship between proper evaluation and sanity."
1,"a work of comedy, right","Why are so many reviewers (both for and against)going aplopectic over this book. This is just meant to be a joke, right. I mean who, with 2 brain cells to rub together, could take Savage's rantings seriously?"
1,Savage Stupidity...,"Michael Savage has just as much right to be as ignorant as he wants. That does not mean, however, he should force it on people, as he does with this uneducated garbage that passes itself off as factual. Mediocre, bland, and more of the same stuff you would get from Ann Coulter, and she barely manages to be slighly more entertaining than this vainglorious, over-opinionated, under-talented, right-wing pseudo-intellectual blowhard hack."
3,Stop attacking Savage for being Jewish,"I keep reading reviews where Savage is slyly attacked for being Jewish. There is also the fact that he may be gay. These attacks detract from what he is saying. This is America where being Jewish and or gay is not a crime. Give the man a break and let him live his life.If you want to attack his politics that is your right, but leave his personal life alone."
1,Why do conservatives want to be lumped in with this guy?,"Really. Every time he opens his mouth with his neo-facist B.S. he discredits all the reasonable things that conservatives say and stand for, but conservatives worship him like a god. They would do well to try to distance themselves as far away as possible from his and what he says.He is the conservative charicature that liberal ideologues draw of the right, and that does sane Republicans a great disservice."
3,"Okay, I'll take the middle...","If you weed out a lot of the rhetoric and sarcasm and really get to his point Savage makes a good one. I agree with his point that the left has just gotten toooo cute in this country. However, while he seems briliant at times at what he does, there seems to be gaps in his knowledge. For example, his views on social sciences and psychology. He throws the baby out with the bath water, a basic, extreme, either/or, approach is just not healthy for people suffering with mental issues in this country. Research is not as concrete like chemistry, but is getting close (e.g., look current brain imaging studies). We should not be ashamed our past, however, and he is right. He is a soldier...sorry, I mean Colonel... at leading this debate. ..."
1,Just what the country needed... ANOTHER right wing manifesto,"I listen to this guy every day on the radio, and he is beyond the fringe! He is not referred to as ""Whacky"" by many in the SF Bay Area for nothing. It is entertaining radio, a guilty pleasure much like looking at a multiple injury car wreck. I just have to listen to his wild exclamations just to see if he will explode. His book is so full of distortions, it boggles the mind. Lets just call everybody he doesn't agree with a Stalinist, communist, or something more pedestrian such as vermin. It is really quite remarkable that he can keep it up throughout the whole book. Savage isn't even this guy's real last name (it is Wiener)! The extra-chromosome right wing should love this bilge, and the rest on the right will enjoy it as well. It is about as accurate and truthful as a typical comic book, without the pretty pictures. If you believe the ... he writes in this ranting, hate speech of a book, I've got a nice bridge to sell you!"
1,More Right Wing Race Baiting,"What a piece of racist garbage this is. The fact the ""Savage"" can't even use his real name, ""Weiner"" shows that he's a phony that has to hide.If name calling and total hyperbole is your game this is probably for you.I'm guessing the only reason this book is on the charts is because of conservative institutional book buying, ie: conservative organizations buying each others books in bulk to prop the propaganda."
1,The truth is what you want to hear.,"Left or right, many tend to adhere dogmatically to one side of the fence. This gentleman is no different than any other person, liberal or conservative, who confuses vehemence for righteousness. This was a difficult read primarily for the surreal leaps in logic, the apparently baseless assumptions (citing other propoganda sheets of equally dubious veracity is not a great substitute for true research or valid debate), and blinkered vitriol make this just another sad addition to the pantheon of publications that put a hardcover on a barroom argument and call it social commentary."
1,Typo on the cover,"After reading only a small part of this book, I realized that the spelling in the title was incorrect. It should have been ""Kultur""."
1,The person who decided to publish this should be fired,"I have never heard Savage's radio show, though I did see him on MSNBC (before he was fired) a couple of times after I finished the book. I consider myself a left-leaning independent, but I like to read a wide range of political literature. I wouldn't reccomend this to anyone, however. It's just one long rant by an angry man who seems to feel that we should return to the days when women, gays and immigrants were oppressed. This book might appeal to the standard 'angry white man', but, for the intelligent among us, it just doesn't fly. For good conservative books, check out D'Souza. I don't agree with him either, but at least he's respectful and articulate."
1,From one conservative to another--Don't waste your money.,"Let's face it: No one short of the far right of the political spectrum is going to buy this book. That means if you are viewing this page, you are a conservative, like me. The reaction of liberals to Michael Savage's outspoken and vitriolic brand of political and social commentary is predictable. Those of us leaning in the opposite direction might well agree with many of Savage's views and appreciate his biting and witty insights, but that does not make this doorstop of a book worth reading. Nothing written in these pages hasn't been hashed and rehashed on ""The Savage Nation"" a hundred times, and all of it loses a great deal in the translation from the radio to print. I can't describe how disappointed I was by this purchase. I didn't expect an intellectual journey, just an enjoyable and amusing one. I got neither."
1,"And a rather Paranoid Nation, too!","Whether they're paranoid, hysterical, eager for attention, or just trying to make a buck, there will always be those who will cynically pander to our darkest fears and insecurities, and that's what Savage is doing here."
2,Disappointing,"For a person who claims to be scientifically trained, this book wouldn't stand up to any logical review. I've caught the radio show a few times, and the commentary is exagerated for effect, but I would have thought that the book would have more substance. It seems that audio tapes of old commentaries were transcribed verbatim into print form, without anything new added. (By the way, of the 18 or so mostly ""science based books we keep hearing that MS has written, how many of them have been peer reviewed??)"
5,One thing I like about this book...,"...is the reviews about it that are being posted by the lunatics of the left. Those reviews are proof positive that anyone who disagrees with a lunatic liberal is engaging in hatred. To the left, get a brain. Just becuase someone doesn't agree with you doesn't mean they hate you. Most likely they don't because you're not worth wasting one's breath on.The book highlights all those things that have given rise to the commentary that it is based on. Savage neither threatens, attempts to coerce others to threaten or does anything in any way to intimidate the left other than to let them know that someone can see what their maniacal thought processes and policies have done to the country. Thank god someone uncovers the craziness these people put us through every single day of our lives."
2,Read his books about herbal medicine,"His real name is Michael A. Weiner. Before he 'became' a radio talk show host he wrote herbal medicine books and was a darling of the San Fransico left wing crowd. His claim to fame was swiming naked with left wing poet Alan Ginsburg in Fiji. I am not certain this guy is serious - my fear is he is putting on an act to make the 'right' look like a bunch of crazies. I've listened to his show and read his book, and I don't know if he is being serious. If you look at his past, you would might agree."
1,Salvaged Notions,"Fake name (I'd have changed it too), dark glasses, he's another authoritarian dreamer in the McCarthy mold in need of an Enemy. The guy seems to have exhausted himself though, he's done this same mein kamph routine to death nightly. No subtlety here, but he does give his worried followers the pre-digested cold left-overs they crave."
5,"Amazing Value, Amazing Quality","I bought this TV as a birthday present for a friend, somewhat skeptical of the price considering the size of the unit. In reality, the TV turned out to be the best purchase I could have made - it works perfectly, it's unbelievably affordable, and it's got a great picture quality. The specs are identical to pricer models with brand names. I fully intend to get one for myself."
5,Awesome novel! ^.^,"Ever since i picked up this book i haven't put it down. I bragged about it to my friends who keep bugging me to lend it to them. I was even so impressed that it was the basis of one of my english assesments.The characters were fantastic, its about time we have lead female characters who can kick some ass!I look forward to the sequel and keep up the good work!"
1,is not working,the charger is not working.. i just want another one.if is posible sent me a good onethank you
5,Perfect for a novice like me.,Wanted to learn a dance with my ten footed girlfriend. We put it in and instantly felt the ice melt away as we where following Shawn through the video. He explains everything very well and gives a lot of useful tips throughout. Im glad i picked this up. Would highly recommend to anyone wanting to start swing dancing.
2,Not a good pen,"Shortly after receiving the pen, it started to have unpleasant noise when writing, and then the ""fountain"" started to leak ink, had to wipe the pen every time before using."
3,close but no cigar,"This pen has the form, but not the quality function of a better model. The ink line is too full and a bit gloppy going on, and a thinner line nib is not available. If I had it to do again, I would have passed on this and applied the $50 to a better device."
4,Cross Fountain Pen,"Pen arrived as stated at the price quoted. High quality packaging with one reservation. The box was meant for a set of two and could not be used as a gift box since it looked as if one item was missing. The pen was a gift and the user really likes it. ( 4 star rating due to box, pen was 5 star )"
4,A warming and sweet story for all ages,"I started the Shoe books a few years ago. The first one was absolutley stupendous and cute. This one is amazing too.Although each book is its own story, they are all linked with an amazing writing quality and performance.This one is the story of Holly, Sorrel and Mark, whose grandfather, who supports them, just died -- so they go and live with their grandmother who puts them in an Academy for Stage Training and Dancing. It starts out rough but they learn to like, and even love it.The overall story is really sweet a precious, which still warms my heart to this day."
3,"Love the Book, but is this Abridged?","I first read Theatre Shoes when I was eleven years old and I adored it. I read every other ""Shoes"" book that the nearby library had, and have reread them often since. A few days ago, I finally decided that I wanted to have my own copy and once I bought it, I immediately started reading the book yet again.I noticed a couple small changes to the book right away, but mostly they were language updates (such as hiccoughed to hiccuped) until I noticed that the description of the Academy was quite different. Comparing my copy (a 2003 printing) to my library's copy (from 1983), I found that in some places over a page of text had been cut, while smaller cuts occurred all over the book. The text was also slightly altered to put a stronger focus on Sorrel's growing up.This book is still good, but the old version is much better. I will probably buy a used old edition, and return the new one."
1,what a pain in the hinny -,Do not buy this party bus... it is the worst piece of polly pocket toys. The bus is a maze to put together and take apart. Durability nada... keep shopping..
3,CD is all you need,"Let me start by saying that in the past 2 weeks I have passed both the ARRT (CI) and the RCIS with high scores. But the suggestion that memorizing the questions and answers on the study materials will be adequate to obtain a passing score, is very wrong. I studied an astronomical amount of hours (20-30 hrs a week for 3+ months) and I still felt like the tests really made me use reasoning skills...know and understand the explanations. I bought all of the books and the CD but I never opened a single book. My studying consisted of the CD and the internet to answer lingering questions.The cons -The MULTIPLE grammatical and mathematical errors and conflicting explanations and answers are VERY frustrating. It is sad that a program that is representative of the field is discrediting because of the complete lack of attention to detail."
4,Perfect component for the man cave,"With 2 TVs side by side, I was looking for a solution to quickly switch audio from one tv to another. So I got this little gem and sent the digital optical audio cables from the 2 tvs into it, and sent another cable from the switcher into my home theater. Now I control volume with one remote without messing with the volume on each TV. Plus, when there's a big play on one tv, I can quickly switch the audio over to that one. Works great. Easy setup. Love the remote. Plus, the remote signal is compatible with universal remotes like the Logitech Harmony One. Highly recommended."
1,HEAVY PIECE OF JUNK NOT WORKING OUT OF THE BOX,"EVERYTHING is in the title...opened, plugged, not working! By the way, considering its functions, this crap is quite heavy...probably more than a kg."
4,Nice product,This is a good product that is exactly as described. The remote isn't great but I use a Harmony one with it.The seller shipped quickly.
3,Great when it works!,"Other than the fact that only two of the inputs worked, I really like this device. It gave me the ability to use multiple optical inputs (not above two in my case) and switch between them at my leisure with the credit card remote. When it works it is top notch!"
3,the reason for marriage,"If you are a fan of Stephanie Laurens you will enjoy this book, I enjoyed it very much. I look forward to each and every book of hers."
4,"Bravo, Freefolk!","I couldn't have said it any better. Reasons for Marriage was a light, sweet, love story. Written in 1995, I noticed. Maybe that is why it isn't plaqued with the sex/porn of today's authors. I read Perfect Lover by SL and thought I would never read another of her books. The sex in Perfect overwhelmed whatever tender relationship that was developed, losing any interest in the romance/love for the main characters, a problem so many authors are writing today. I am glad I gave Reasons for Marriage a shot. I, too, love Mary Balogh, Putney, Garwood and McNaught. We've lost Garwood and McNaught. Keep writing Mary and Mary Jo. There aren't many left writing with intrique, passion (poignant passion) and that hard to find ""love"". The passionate, poignant, depth of love, no longer found in the writings of most historical romance authors today."
1,Disappointing in the extreme!,I am a Stephanie Laurens fan in the main but felt compelled to review this book because of my surprise at it's boringness. Nothing whatever happens apart from a ridiculous misunderstanding where the hero doesn't know where his wife is during the afternoons! She's in her room you dunderhead! They live in the same house by the way and have servants etc. One simple question would have sorted this quandary. Could barely finish this. The pedantic descriptions and conversations led me to put the book down on several occaisions. I did finish it out of respect for the author.
5,A great history...,"not only of the start of a great show, but also details British television history and pop culture to put it into a larger context. Sometimes academic, sometimes fanwankish, but never tiresomely pedantic or boring. Can't wait to pick up the next volumes."
4,Good for its day - still serving now with 1 Gig Ram,"This wa s decant laptop in its day. Don't believe the garbage about its maximum memory Toshiba Satellite 3005-S304 being 512k PC133 !!!I have the Phoenix bois (never upgraded or flashed)and I put two 512k chips for a total of 1 gig of ram.Window XP recognizes the ram just fine and I have tested actual sustained ram load up into the 900k (well into the second 512k chip) No problems so far. This RAM upgrade made an incredible difference!I wanted to try to make it into a MS Office,WiFi/Internet computer because of it s small size and ease of mobility, but with SP3 it was just plain choking on only 256k of ram. It will never be like a new computer, but will serve for a few more years in this capacity. I took a chance and it worked out well. If they made larger than 512k PC133 chips I would try them, however I have not been able to find them."
2,This is a terrible phone,"I purchased this phone from Target and it was a terrible phone. The phone had constant static and had no range. Now I know that this phone is not a true 2.4 GHZ. This means that it is 2.4 GHZ to the handset and 900mhz from the handset to the base. I thought the styling of the phone was great and I loved the illuminated antenna. Oh, that brings me to my next point, the keypad is not illuminated just the screen. You can at least check the numbers you are dialing. The answering machine leaves much to be desired as well. I think that GE has a great beta for a product and the price sure seemed right at the time. They just need to refine their technology and I think this would be a wonderful phone.BTW I took it back and bought the Uniden TRU248, what a great phone."
2,Very disappointed,"This is a great phone if you like to buy new phones every few months. The half-life of mine was 7 months. It was actually great up until that point. One day I answered it and the caller couldn't hear me; they hung-up thinking no one was there. From then on, it was unusable. This phone didn't even live through its warranty. This is the second time I got burned by a GE product; never again."
1,Wrong music,"My fault, probably, but I bought this thinking it was a cover of some old Beatles tracks by various newer artists heard during the movie, but instead, it was all the other music. If you want the Beatles tracks you have to buy the CD called something like ""music inspired by the movie""."
4,Not too bad.,"I do like this product. It does its job. My only complaint is that its not much cream for the price and that the pump does get a little air in it and messed up on a few pumps but not too bad...Also the only real difference between the ""men"" and ""women's"" cream, is that there is only 10 mg of progesterone in the men's and 20 mg in women's...So it would be more cost effective to buy the women's and use half a pump. Or get the spray that is easier to regulate."
5,What a great deal!,For someone who doesn't know a lot about computers this was very easy to install and it works great. What a bargin!
5,Beautiful Photography.. It takes your breath away.,"This is a book of wonder.. the photography is simply gorgeous. The colors are outstanding, and the pictures are so realistic, it feels like you are there. Truly a work of art."
5,over the door shoe rack,"I like it very much , especially the over the door hooks - they aren't even noticable from the other side. Very happy with my purchase"
5,...one giant step for mankind...,"Discover really keeps their stories current; and the art work inside is really well done. Not just your same-old stale illustrations, but really well corresponding images to explain the sometimes complex research.Definitely more approachable, yet thorough, than other science mags (Nature, Scientific American, National Geographic)"
4,Great way to keep up on the go...,"This is a great magazine that covers the lot of science, technology, space and everything (at least the interesting stuff) in between. You can pick it up and quickly read the shorter articles, or if you have a little more time, there are a few longer ones as well. Discover is ALWAYS interesting and worth the price."
4,Discover backwards is Revocsid,"I like Discover because the percent of articles I care to read tends to be a little higher than Scientific American, which is one of other favorite magazines. Discover at times can be a little too pop culture for me, but there always seems to be some interesting little nugget of knowledge in each issue that keeps me coming back. This magazine helps to fill the void between popular weekly magazines (e.g. Newsweek, Time) and technical journals that require a Ph.D. to understand. In this great era of science and technology, our democracy requires that we remain informed of important developments across the many fields in science. This magazine helps us to do that, so it serves an important role."
3,A TV Show on Paper,"DISCOVER has positioned itself somewhere halfway between ""Nature"" and ""People"" magazines. There are still fine, lucid, informative articles, though not in every issue, but there are also ill-written inadequately fact-checked blurts. If your basic scientific fund of knowledge is broad enough, you'll have no trouble ignoring the latter. More annoying for me are the occasional feature articles that slither into science-fantasy, that suggest serious professional interest in flimsy fly-by-night notions.Nevertheless, I subscribe. I even pick it up at kiosks when I'm on the road and I miss an issue. It's not a big investment of reading time -- scarcely a flight from Minneapolis to Montreal worth -- and precisely because it's mere pop journalism, it's less infuriating than Scientific American."
5,Science at my fingertips,I've been a reader of Discover ever since I found it at my dentist's office. It made the waiting seem more bearable. Not too complex in its stories and there is a wide variety of subjects covered every month.
2,Gone Way Downhill,"Recently renewed my subscription after a three year hiatus and I couldn't believe my eyes. The magazine is a skeleton of its former self, with slim stories and little science. Bob Guccione Jr's mag is not even that fun to read. On the happier side, the magazine appears to shun its earlier environmental preoccupations."
4,Pretty good...,I'm not a scientist or in the science field for that matter but this magazine is ok from what I've gathered. I've only gotten one issue so far so I cannot make a very informed judgment on it. I got it for $10 for a year so I think it is a good value.
3,"Not a bad magazine, but there are better","At first glance, Discover is a great magazine. Its articles are a quick read, relatively well written, and entertaining. However, I found that I quickly outgrew it as I was exposed to more substantive non-journal magazines, such as Scientific American or Nature. Its not that Discover is a bad magazine, its just not as in depth or broad in its coverage as others out there on the newstand."
3,An issue with the issue,"The description on the page above says, ""The first issue should arrive in 6-10 weeks"" which suited my purpose perfectly since I ordered it well ahead of time as a birthday gift for my wife.However, the first issue came almost immediately for the month that was almost over, followed in short order by another for the upcoming month. This allows Discover to send renewal notices sooner, I suppose (actually, I think they start putting renewal notices in from the first issue). It also may work out great for those who are in a bigger hurry."
2,Not nearly as good as earlier works,"I've been a BIG fan of Bradbury's work for some time - both his short stories (as collected in tomes like 'The Illustrated Man' and 'A Medicine for Melancholy') and his novels ('Farenheit 451' in particular). Thus, it was with great anticipation that I read this collection.Sadly, my anticipation was far exceeding the enjoyment I got out of reading the stories.That isn't to say that the stories presented were really bad - just not particularly engrossing, memorable or filled with wonder. Some of them seemed particularly dated; those were the ones that were presented as happening in ""the present"" of the early 90's (when they were written). This seemed quite odd as some of Bradbury's older works - which one would imagine being even more out of date - don't seem to suffer from this in the slightest.Unless you're a completist, I'd recommend finding his earlier short story collections; they're much better."
4,Still Good Stuff,"Bradbury has once again written a very good collection. As compared with everybody else is is still the best collection out there. as compared against his own work, is still good but not a classic. This may not be fair to him, but ""Quicker Than the Eye"" just does not rise up to his historic standards. This collection seems to about death in its various forms, but told through the eye of a romantic. Some of the stories are about true horror ""The Finnegan"" and some of the stories are about time travel ""The Witch Door"". My personal favorites are ""If MGM is Killed, Who Gets the Lion?"" and ""Free Dirt"". The first leaves a smile on your face and the second is a macabre tale about getting free dirt from a graveyard. This is still good stuff and is a very enjoyable way to pass the time, just not up to the legendary standards of the past. Recommended."
4,Bradbury returns in strong form,"Typical of Bradbury's collections, this one can not be categorized as horror, sci-fi, fantasy or reality...but as a melting pot of all of them. With nine original stories in this collection, it should definitely find its way onto the bookshelf of any Bradbury fan. While not every story is a standout, he's got enough here to satisfy anyone who enjoys the short story format. Highlights include ""The Finnegan"", one of the few out-and-out horror stories; the title piece, which packs a punch while remaining firmly grounded in reality, and ""The Very Gentle Murders"" a completely twisted and funny tale about an elderly couple competing to do each other in. With stories ranging from the gentle (""Last Rites"") to the brutal (""Electrocution"") it ultimately satisfies in a number of genres. Hopefully, it won't be another decade before his next collection"
5,great book,I recommend this book to anyone who has lost a loved one or who is concerned about dying. It is a very uplifting book.
3,It's ok,This book was recommended by Andrew Wommack but I really didn't like it like I thought I would and I let my mother read it too but she didn't like it either.
5,My Dream of Heaven,I made this purchase for a friend because she had never ordered from Amazon before and her church pastor had been looking for this particular book. Both she and the pastor were delighted with it. I helped my friend set up her own account and she has ordered more of the books to donate to her church.
3,Just okay,"I was really looking forward to this book, especially with all of the good reviews. It was just ok. It started out ok, but then every chapter was pretty much the same over and over again. And then to read at the end that it was basically a book that people needed at the time because they needed a reason to believe. There are others that are MUCH better. As a matter of fact, Return From Tomorrow by George Ritchie has changed my life. Highly recommend that one."
5,"excellent, well done and very professional. loved it..",enjoyed all of the songs. also the background instrument and voice are first class.
3,Pronunciation guide needs work,"Gaelic pronunciation is so different from English that a CD is absolutely necessary to be able to figure it out. However, the pronunciation guide on this CD is inadequate. I can hear that there are more ways to pronounce certain letters than are given in the guide (For example, the letter L pronounced as V), which leaves me pretty much at sea with getting into the exercises themselves. Even with memorization of the sounds, it may be difficult to begin.I think they could improve the CD by including any odd pronunciations that were left out, and perhaps by giving some attention to pairs of vowels within words, which sounded like diphthongs to me. A glossary with phonetic (IPA) key would possibly be useful. But maybe that's another book :)"
4,Tha e math!,"This is one of the most useful Gaelic books I have used. Interesting lessons and activities are combined with cultural notes. The tapes are necessary for pronunciation. Like most books, it can only teach you to read and write. When used in conjunction with a conversation group or organized lessons, this book works very well.To use along with ""Gaelic : A Complete Course for Beginners,"" I recommend Morag MacNeill's ""Everyday Gaelic"" and ""Dwelly's Gaelic/English dictionary."" You'll soon be on your way with this wonderful language."
2,Over Priced,"I totally agree with the reviewer who implied Acorn Media is short-changing the public, who consistently wait for the new Poirot DVDs episodes. This set is minus two episodes, already available in Britain.If you want all four episodes, ""Mrs. McGinty's Dead"", ""Cat Among the Pigeons"", ""Third Girl"" and ""Appointment With Death"" you can order it as ""Agatha Christie's Poirot - Collection 7 [DVD] [2008]"" from the Amazon.uk website. It is produced with a Region 2 DVD format; so you will need a DVD all-region player or one that has been adapted to play both Region-coded DVD's. You can probably get this cheaper too from overseas than Acorn Media, which has consistently been over-priced and always behind in putting out the episodes of this Poirot series and other mystery series."
1,Mismatched and unattractive,"Maybe this lamp could have masqueraded as a decent looking lamp with a lighter colored shade. However, the clashing of the shade and the base just makes it look worse. The base is painful to look at, and the shade isn't much better. This lamp is an eyesore."
5,Good Information,"This is one of those booklets that give you a lot of information if you are new to the field of self-publishing. I knew a lot of the info, so it wasn't new to me, but now I have a book that is small enough to look up information very quickly."
2,Disappointing Contents,"It is with great hesitation that I offer any criticism of a book of this nature. I have no doubt that the author has agenda of honoring God is all his writing, including this one. However, I found the book surprisingly brief and far too ""chatty"" in nature. It was not particularly helpful or insightful about the many questions that I wanted to have addressed about getting a Christian book published. It was not really up to what I would call basic information, once you get past the importance of praying about what you want to write. I found a number of other books that were in stark contrast to this one. I would recommend checking this one out.The Complete Idiot's Guide to Getting Published, 4th Edition (Complete Idiot's Guide to)Athough it is not focused on Christian book publishing it was excellent. I would like to find a book like this that addresses the uniqueness of Christian publishing, but have not yet found it."
2,Slow and boring,"I thought this movie was going to be a thriller. Nope. Boring as heck. A lot of talking, hardly any action. So Charlie Banks rats on that Mike kid, who only beat up 2 other boys. Those 2 other boys were trying to be macho and probably would have kicked Mike's butt anyway if he hadn't beat them first. Banks ends up retracting his statement to the cops. Big deal. Mike shows up at Banks' college. I thought things would pick up from there. It got even more boring. Rich kids drinking, smoking, partying, talking...zzzzzzzz. Only good parts were the beat downs later on in the film.The only word I can think of to describe this film is ""flat""."
2,The Education of Charlie Banks,"I'm not going to waste space with a synopsis, since there is one right on this page, so I'll just give you my thoughts. I found this movie to be terribly uneven and uneventful. What you would expect is a darkly tinged coming of age tale, what you receive is a director trying too hard to make this into a classic, which it just could not be. The film is overly long and perhaps if more time was spent in the editing room it may run a bit smoother and not lag in so many places. It's not particularly well acted, the script is linear and flat, and the direction is mediocre at best. I really wanted to like this because it sounds great, but let's face it; it's been done before and done much better. But it's not all bad, unfortunately the bad does outshine the good aspects here."
3,Ambitious,"I liked THE EDUCATION OF CHARLIE BANKS enough to watch it from start to finish. The acting and ambitious story line (the director plays with serious themes) were both solid attempts. Yet the whole enterprise left me rather cold. I think one of the most bothersome things about the film was the choice to set it in the 1970s...not that there's anything wrong with that. But when a film (or a book or a play) is set in a specific time period, I think there should be a reason for it. Otherwise, it's distracting and you ending up watching it and wondering, ""Okay, what is the artist trying to say about that period? How did the period play into the artistic thesis?"" With this film, the question was unanswerable; it could have been set just as easily in current times. This kind of detail is something that should have been thought through before the cameras rolled and is indicative of a desire to impress without thinking first of what one is communicating."
3,too tight,"these are too tight.I think they are thinner than normal...not sure...might have to wear them out, but it is almost too uncomfortable."
4,Delicate chandeliers,Not the smallest chandelier earrings but very pretty & excellent price. Fun to wear.
1,Lamb Of God puppets..to hell with this band,"This band would be nothing if not for lamb of god whereing there T-shirts. And how dare someone mention Cid, obviously he was good enough to get them this far.These guys have turned into pricks, and now there music is cliche' and S%$T, you lost a fan here, go back to the garagelisten to DIllinger Escape Plan insted"
2,Vanilla in a bowl of Cherry Garcia,"I bought Through The Eyes of the Dead's new album after hearing only one song on Sirius. That album was one of the best purchases music wise I made this year. I heard a song from Byzantine on Sirius as well and proceeded to buy their album. It was an ultimate disapointment. Anyone comparing them to Meshuggah is nuts. There is nothing original or new about this album. The vocals are very weak, and dull. The guitars are no Fredrik Thordendal that's for sure. Maybe their ""style"" of playing just isn't appealing to me, or maybe it is the vocalist trying to impersonate Burton C. Bell from Fear Factory with his singing. Then again, no one likes the singing from Fear Factory either. If you like plain, generic, vanilla metal, then this is your album."
4,wonderful account of orangutan research/conservation,"the path to the front lines of organismal research and conservation seems to have so many different twists, turns, and multiple-laned streets. and once there it seems as though there is no path at all, but just wide open space. it really is a different kind of life, and unless you can get out there and try to experience it, this is the absolute next best thing.and then there's the orangutans..."
3,Melodic Death,"Soul Embraced have managed to combine elements of In Flames, ""Heartwork"" era Carcass, Living Sacrifice style groove, and occasional (not enough, in my opinion) brutality a la Cannibal Corpse. The vocals are mostly of the seething, hissing variety, with occasional melody or low growling parts. The musicianship is not especially technical for death metal, but it is tight and heavy. Lance Garvin's drumwork is extremely tight and impressive as always, and the production quality is quite good as well. The downfall, though, is that this disc just doesn't seem to go anywhere. The songs seem to end before I can really get into them. It's solid, but just kind of average. All in all, I would recommend this if you're into the bands I mentioned above, or if you're into the ""new school"" style of death metal, but it just doesn't move me the way I hoped it would."
5,Masterpiece!,"This album is DMX' best album out there! If u dont own it then u have no idea what u r missing out! I bought it couple of years back and i still play it almost everyday! There is no way anyone is gonna forget to put it on their top 10 list!Songs like RUFF RYDERS ANTHEM, F**kin' WIT D, GET AT ME DOG & STOP BEING GREEDY have the rawest X lyrics ever!!! He is spittin over some dope beats and his flow is unstoppable!Buy it if u dont already own it! Dont download it! BUY IT!"
1,Get Your Own Opinion (for a Change),"If you're even thinking of buying this, it's most likely because you're an utter conformist and not because you geniunely found rap to be interesting (without being spoonfed your opinion on what's good music.) Stop watching TV and develop your own opinions for a change."
5,"ARE YOU REALLY READY FOR THE ""X"" !!!!!","DMX AND HIS DOGS BITE!! WHAT MORE CAN YOU SAY, YES IT'S ME AGAIN AND YA'LL KNOW THE DEAL. SAY IT WIT ME, 'X' IS A GOD. YEAH YOU MAY LAUGH BUT ANSWER ME THIS, HAS DMX EVER CAME OUT WITH SOMETHING THAT DIDNT HAVE YOU BOBBING YOUR HEAD, WHAT? HE HASN'T, THEN GIVE HIM HIS PROPS PUNK!! I'M REAL 'X' , A FAN FOREVER, SO I'M GOING TO TELL IT LIKE IT IS. YOUR ALBUM IS BANGIN', BANGIN, TO THE FULLIEST. GOT ME SAYIN' WHAT, WHAT, LIKE N.O.R.E. I'M FROM JERSEY, BUT CHILLEN' IN VA FOR A WHILE, 'X' CAME WIT JZ AND TORE THE COLLISUM UP, NO DOUBT. ""FLESH OF MY FLESH AND BLOOD OF MY BLOOD"", I DON'T THINK THEY HEAR YOU 'X'. BUT I DO SO KEEP IT COMING, TEAR DAT MIC UP!!!"
5,SO TIGHT,"THIS CD IS SO TIGHT. da best song is ""ruff ryders anthem."" i don't know what to say except this cd is so tight. dmx, 2pac, and nas are the best rappers ever. shout out to all da ruff ryders!"
4,i think dmx is the ****,dmx has come out with one of the best albums of the year.i think artists will have to try very hard to bring hip hop to a level above him.
1,"He ain't no rapper, he's a entertainer","The only reason people like him is because he screams. He is the wackest MC ever, probabaly. And he has no talent at all. Have you ever heard him rap when he dosen't scream? He sounds wac as hell in 14 of the songs. The only good song is Ruff Ryders' Anthem. If you think DMX is the best east coast rapper, then You don't know nothing about rap. The only good rapper in Ruff Ryders in Drag-On."
3,"Good, but he sounds like a carbon-copy of Tupac...","I'm not really sure how I'ma rate this CD... It ain't bad enough for 2 or 1 stars, but it ain't good enough for 4 or 5 stars either.I mean, many of the songs are good. But some of them has horrible lyrics. And DMX' fucked-up dog-growls sound pretty stupid.Still, ""It's Dark And Hell Is Hot"" is a good debut and I'm sure DMX can do better.-Wrecka"
5,Ha So Many Haters,"With the New album ""Grand Champ"" it is evident that he is not the ""grand champ"" but it is always good to look back on his debut. Some rappers use their best material on their debut (Nas, Jay Z, Mobb Deep) and DMX follows that trend. It is undoubtiling a masterful album with the familar song being the ruff ryder anthem. My favorite song is Look Thru my Eyes, best beat, lyrics and hook. X even manages to fit Freddy Kruger into the song X is coming. The album has a perfect blend, it is almost like a story being told.1-2 X is coming for you! 3-4 Better lock your door. 5-6 Get your Crucifix. 7-8 Don't stay up late. 9-10 Sing it again"
2,"Been there, done that",What a disappointing collection of quilt patterns and color combos. Only one or two interesting ideas in the whole book. Sadly disappointing. Expected better from this author.
1,THE WORST PHONE I'VE EVER OWNED!!!,"REALLY PEOPLE, DON'T BUY THIS PHONE IF YOU WANT ACTUAL QUALITY. I DON'T USUALLY WRITE REVIEWS OF PRODUCTS (THIS IS MY FIRST), BUT I FEEL THE NEED TO DUE TO MY UTTER DISGUST W/ VTECH. I BOUGHT THIS OVER-PRICED PIECE OF JUNK IN NOVEMBER OF 2000. IT WAS A BIRTHDAY GIFT TO MY FATHER WHO HAS WRIST PROBLEMS (WE THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD SOLUTION. LESS THAN A YEAR LATER THE THING BREAKS AT THE HEADPIECE. NOW, MY FATHER DOESN'T EXACTLY HAVE A HUGE HEAD, AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN VERY CAREFUL WITH HIS POSSESSIONS - ESPECIALLY DELICATE ELECTRONICS. WE DO NOT ABUSE OUR PRODUCTS. AT ...$ (PURCHASE PRICE AT THE TIME) IT SHOULD HAVE LASTED MUCH LONGER THAN 11 MONTHS. VTECH IS TRYING TO DRAIN EVEN MORE MONEY OUT OF ME BY ESTIMATING THE REPAIR COST AT ...$!!!! I WON'T PAY IT AND AM INSTEAD GOING TO BUY ANOTHER COMPANY'S PRODUCT. BUT YOU SHOULD ALL BE WARNED BEFORE BUYING THIS PHONE..."
3,pretty good,"The sound quality is quite good. The range is average.The base station, where you can make and receive regular calls, has the annoying property that pressing the touch tones is deafening, whereas the talk volume is just right. I literally have to remove the phone from my head to press the touch tones, and every time I forgot, I want to break the thing.The other frustrating is that it needs charging all the time. The phone seems to run out of power very quickly even when it's not in use.I am tempted just to buy a little cell-phone like ear piece for the other phone that I have, and use that instead. It's got much better range, and is less cumbersome."
4,Lounge Music Before It Became Lounge Music,"Even though it is said that Mr. Sinatra couldn't read music, he nevertheless was able to conduct this instrumental album to good effect. As reviewer Ricky Wright states Mr. Sinatra did a commendable job conducting Dean Martin's album called ""Sleep Warm"". Frank also did the conducting chores on another album at Captiol with Peggy Lee. Both are currently unavailable on CD."
2,too many mistakes,"This book is laid out well, and is written in a very readable, pleasant style. The CD is also very convenient. However, it is very unreliable. The list of errata at sybex.com will give you an idea of the type and number of mistakes. There are mistakes in questions and answers on exams, including basic arithmetic errors. There are also more substantive conceptual errors that go beyond one-word typos (confusing ""qualitative"" with ""quantitative"" and incorrectly describing types of contracts, for example). I haven't yet taken the exam, but am planning to buy another book (Mulcahy), because I can't trust the content of this one. I don't know how many errors I may be learning as facts. Good price, but not a good value."
2,Too many errors to be used alone,"Don't be fooled into thinking that this book alone will get you ready for passing the PMP Cert exam. The PMP exam is much harder than any other cert. Don't expect this book's into to PM style is enough to pass the exam.Kim's book is lacking in many ways; too many errors and ommisions for my taste. For example, Kim got it wrong - the five process groups are not phases! Controlling is not a phase. It's this lack of critical thinking that will lull you into thinking you're ready to take the exam when you're not.I prefer PMP Cert For Dummies - and so do all those in my study group. Between us, we have all the books. Our recommendation is to buy several books - this one along with PMP cert is a good combo. By the way, Rita's is too overpriced and omits too many things for self-study. If you like Rita's re-cycled class workbook take her $1,100 course instead and get it for free."
5,This Plus the PMBOK are All you Need!,"Everyone seems to pitch the Rita book and materials, but Kim Heldman's book and the PMBOK are all you'll need to pass the PMP. I went crazy studying for the PMP and bought just about everything under the sun to prepare - Audio CDs, Software, Books, etc. I didn't even open the Rita materials or the PMP for Dummies...all I used was this book and the PMBOK.My suggestion...read this book from cover to cover and create flash cards for key topics. Study the key topics, paying special attention to WHEN you acually apply the different tools & techniques (think ""in what situations would I apply this technique vs another technique""). Then read the PMBOK a few times and create flash cards for that material. Study your flash cards and take as many practice tests as you can.You'll end up learning everything you need to know to pass the PMP AND to actually manage projects!Good Luck!"
2,PMP: Project Management Professional Study Guide,"I do not reccommend this Study Guide, primarily because the editting of it was very sloppy. There are misspelled words ""Manger"" for ""Manager"" throughout the book. Also, be wary of the CD that is included. It contains all of the materials and several bonus tests/exams, etc. However, many of the questions/answers are incorrect.I reviewed/studied the physical book first and then did a second pass through the CD. I discovered several questions/answers that were incorrect. Very sloppy editting!!!I would strongly reccommend that you purchase a different Study Guide for the PMP Exam."
3,nothing new here,"If you don't already have an album by these two, get this one. however, if you have several and are looking for something you haven't heard, keep looking. particularly there are a number of Nelson Eddy songs not released here, or any place else, as far as I can tell, and I'd love to have them. he did a whole collection of old hymns, none of which appear to have been re-issued, plus other items. This album is yet another re-packaging of the usual Eddy/McDonald songs you can find anywhere--good ones, yes, and in fine fettle for their age, but nothing different."
5,Jeanette MacDonald,"As I have said before, I just love Jeanette's voice and could listen to her all day. She was one of a kind."
4,Marianna Class of 1986,"The book doesn't tell it all, but it's close. I would recommend it to all.Marianna, at one time, carried the nickname of 'Little Detroit'.I graduated with Otis in the Lee Senior High School class of 1986 so I lived this story firsthand.There is no exaggeration that he received a standing ovation during the graduation ceremonies. He was considered a hero among many of my classmates (very unfortunately.)Otis was always soft spoken (at least around me) yet I never saw anyone try to provoke him.In Marianna you either work on a farm, work for the city or county gov't, work for the (only one) local industry or you're unemployed.I have since departed from Marianna, but I'm not far away - I still visit family and friends there on a regular basis.I've always thought all social services workers should be interned in small rural areas such as that of Marianna - maybe they would have a better perspective on what I call 'the REAL world'.YOU should have a visit sometime!"
2,Marginal utility,"Though exclusionary by race, class, and gender, even in the second edition, the contents are indisputably important. That said, the set's unintroduced, unannotated texts, reproduced in _very_ small type defeat the compilers' purpose. And, but for Adler's introductory essays (available from Amazon vendors in a popular edition) the Syntopicon is a boondoggle. These flaws are compounded by reliance on very old public-domain translations which ""erect more barriers between reader and text than the original"" languages themselves. Great Bookies would do better to buy individual works in recent paperback editions with full critical apparatus."
4,None,loved this story! wish i didnt have to wait so long waiting for the next page to load. otherwise an enjoable read.
1,boring!!!,This book was so long and boring. In the beginning the book was interesting but as it continued on the book got worse. Its like the author kept trying yo drag out the book longer by making unnecessary arguments between the characters which really didn't make sense. And then it took forever to figure out what the main character went through. All I know is throughout reading the book I just couldn't wait for it to be over with
1,Don't Buy This DVD Player!,"These are the problems we found:1. Audio-visual synchronization malfunctions frequently.2. The images are elongated. The actors appear taller than they are.3. Discs with even the slightest flaws stop playing, and sometimes even new discs with no flaws cause difficulties.In order to finish one rented movie, we had to go out and get another DVD player. We ended up buying a Sony DVP-NS57P for a few dollars more and are very glad we did."
1,Many Audio Problems!,"Since I bough this DVD player, I've had issues with the audio. It drops out intermittently during a movie. About 45 minutes into a movie, the audio would always get out of synch with the video. Finally, after about four months, the audio dropped out completely. I returned it and exchanged it for the Sony DVP-NS57P. I've always been sold on Toshiba products, but they dropped the ball on this one. Unfortunately, I will definitely have to think twice from now on before buying another Toshiba product."
4,Pretty cool,"The most remarkable thing about this unit is its ability to play avi, wmv and mpeg files, which units that cost twice as much cannot do. The picture quality is an upgrade from the previous DVD player, especially considering that the picture is going into my six year old non-flat screen. It would be the perfect player if the screen saver would kick in after being on pause for awhile and if the unit could remember where it was at in a video, rather than starting over at the beginning, when the unit is powered down."
3,small powerful case,"Pro: This look awsome, its perfectlly small and very handy if you move a lot you PC.... I mange to put: e8400, Asus P5E-VM HDMI, 4GB OCZ SLI-READY memory, evga 8800GT, 2 HD WD 250gb each, OCZ stealthXtream 600w, dvdrom, esata port, vantec pci fan card and XFI fatal1ty sound card... with a Zalman 7500 and some 12"" cathods... you can put a 9800GX2 but you have to remove the hdd cage...Cons: 2 bad things:1) almost imposible to make good cable management there is no room and because of his 2 side panel you can see everything....2) the only thing you can put in the bay is dvd-rom device... you cant put lcd controlers, thermaltake cigar bay, because the bay is cover by something you can show off your stuff... and if you remove that piece of plastic its bigger than the 5 1/4 bay and its look ugly with anything...."
4,It could be better if S+H was lower,"Many companies charge more on S+H to make up the price differences nowadays. It is just a bait to get customers in the first place. Personally, I think it is a lowsy selling trick and disrespect that. However, I found more and more companies are increasing the S+H charges and there's not much I can do.The only thing I can do is tryo to avoid dealing with such companies whenver possible."
4,Not your regular Wheat Thins,"Please be warned that these ""Wheat Thins Chips Minis"" are different from the regular Wheat Thin that we all love. Maybe I am just a dumb consumer who fell for their clever packaging. Just the same they are good and you will not be disappointed by these very small light thin wheat thin crackers."
2,Have you ever read...,"any of Glen Cook's 'Garrett Files'? Tim Waggoner has. And it shows. From the medieval Sam Spade style main character to the full and half breed 'monsters' to the despised half-rodent half-human servant class this book copies heavily from the detective stories of Cook. And it's too bad because it's rather well written, humorous in places, eerie in others. But I can only give it two stars since someone else got there first."
4,Atmospheric and Gripping,"Zork Nemesis is an absorbing adventure game in the tradition of Myst. You are immersed by music and beautiful graphics. In the game, a dark lord has risen and you are to stop this Nemesis. The puzzles are challenging and the sound effects and music are top notch and very atmospheric. Compared to other Zork games, this one is virtually humorless. The story is dark and depressing, but it doesn't keep it from being an unpleasant game. Zork Grand Inquisitor is much better, but this one is worth playing."
3,"Inexpensive, mediocre sound, good otherwise","We bought this phone because my daughter thought it was cool looking and it was the right color. Beyond that, this phone was inexpensive and is a decent performer.You are not paying for fancy features, or digital clarity and security. And you don't get those for free. If you desire a great phone you need to spend $60-100 more. Sound quality is acceptable, though there is a constant hiss in the background, regarless of how far from the base you are. The hiss is not a problem at the lowest volume setting, but it gets worth as the volume goes up.For us the bottom line is that color and coolness are more important, so this one is a keeper."
4,A great place to start,"I think most people who are somewhat clueless to the stock market would benefit from reading this book. What I like is that it is full of easy examples. Even though I have read some books concerning the same issue, this book was helpful to me. He gives you lots of hints, or should I say quotes other investors, in how to be a good investor, i.e CANSLIM , and basics things like beating the Dow. The downside is, however that if you're not from U.S.A, including me, you will find many pages that are not worthy reading, like Internet resources for American companies. This equals a very good book, which is worth every minute."
2,Was not what I wanted,Wanted a film to help plan my trip. This film did not do that and not worth buying. The tourist industry in the area needs to put out a better video.
5,FRANK AND NELSON AT THEIR VERY BEST,"This is my all time favorite SINATRA cd.Against a set of strings,FRANK never sang better;his voice really comes across beautifully.The question remains:why did he not repeat that experience?A mystery to me.On that cd alone,FRANK equals NAT KING COLE as a ballad singer.At that time 1956,NELSON RIDDLE and SINATRA worked together like twin brothers,everything they did was good:SONGS FOR SWINGIN`LOVERS,A SWINGIN AFFAIR.When the RAT PACK enters,FRANK will begin the self-indulgence and his fans will suffer a little.You've got to buy this one to experience what a great singer FRANK SINATRA was.Each song comes out well in NELSON RIDDLE'S master chef recipes."
2,The worst of the visible engines I have built.,"I have built Renwal's Visible V-8 and NSI's Motor Works as well as starting this model.Some clear parts have cloudy streaks and incomplete molding (voids). The rotors suffer from distortion and shrinkage at the sprues and the clear eccentrics had to be filed down on the edges to fit into the rotor recesses. The rear shell mount where it rests on the stand is deformed and at two different levels at the mating. One of the slotted shafts is spread open at the slot. The gear train is so sloppy that you can turn the output shaft and the gears will slip and grind; I don't know if it will drive the motor when I get that far. The kit was missing an eyelet for the timing plate. The instructions show attaching the plug wires to the timing plate but later you have to pass the leads through several things like the distributor caps, wire sleeves, etc. so you would have to take it apart again. An email with pictures to the manufacturer produced no response."
2,More like a childrens book,"Like my title suggests i think this is more a book for children even though that is not who its ment for.The tricks in this book is often so simple I wouldnt even think of performing them.But it clearly states that it is not normal magic like you usually see, but mental magic.I regret that i didnt spend my money on something else related to magic instead."
4,Works Well,"Easy to install. Works well so far and I've had it in for almost two months. The front plate is a little flimzy though. Overall, a good product."
1,Needs work,"Well, if you like to waste money, this is a good start. I haven't been this dissappointed in a book for a while. I bought it because I need to create reports from my accounting system... I found about 20 percent of the book was helpful, but even then it left out information on how to create financial statements, complex formulas, etc. Yet another reference written by someone who doesn't understand the audience. Business user, yes. Dummy? No. This one needs some work..."
5,This book is a must for anyone publishing to the Web,Information on the internet made publishing reports easy! Seagate's Internet model is great. The screen shots made understanding these concepts easier than Seagate's manual.
5,Thank You for providing such a great book on Crystal Reports,I just recently started using Crystal Reports and bought the Dummies book thinking that would be all I needed. I purchased Prima's Official Guide and have learned so much more from this book than from the Dummies book. I think this is an excellent resource for anyone using Crystal Reports. I also went to BridgeBuilder's website and found out they have sample reports there as well! I just want say THANK YOU! to Prima and BridgeBuilder for providing Crystal users with a GREAT book!
4,Unsettling and beautiful,"Certain stories work better than others, this is true, but the best of them will leave you reeling (""Ice,"" ""The Refugee,"" and ""Gallatin Canyon,"" which upset me deeply). Having lived in Gallatin Canyon, I picked up this collection partly to visit the country I left 27 years ago. I felt a frisson of recognition as he described Four Corners and the treacherous road that passes the ranger station where my family lived. Is it all still there? Yes, apparently it is. But don't assume that this is a ""regional"" collection--it isn't. Stories take place in Florida, Michigan, Washington State, not just Bozeman and environs. I am impressed by this writer's ability to evoke both the internal landscape and the external landscape with equal skill. Highly recommended."
4,"Clear, Entertaining. Enlightening.","This 2006 short story collection is one of McGuane's best, allegedly. I haven't read any of the others, but my first encounter with McGuane's stories was positive. Clear, entertaining, and enlightening, his stories show the side of Montana that city folk like myself didn't know existed. Through the eyes of a local author, we get to read about characters that are unique to that region of the country, yet painted with the brushes of universality.-- Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens"
3,"3.5 --Good, but Sinatra's first slight let down after a streak of near perfect classics","The excellent and newly written title track was and still is terrific; but the remakes of the Columbia era ballads seem in odd juxtaposition to the sly swagger of the song Nice 'n Easy. The Capitol period had, thus far, been an amazing album by album succession of brilliant concepts. Obviously Sinatra (and Riddle) wanted to revisit these old songs and enhance them with more modern arrangements especially compared to the silky Stordahl style; yet, it just doesn't quite work as well as most of the other releases in the Capitol catalogue.I generally do, however, prefer the versions here as opposed to the many earlier versions of these tracks.Is it good? Absolutely - just not quite as good or as original as the expectations based on the remarkable title track."
5,Recorder Pack: Yamaha Ivory,"Excellent product fast delivery i rceive everything what is sopos to be inside pakage ,sound with this instrument is very clear and easy to play,price is good,highly recomended!!!."
3,Average aviation rag.,"I have had this magazine for well over 20 years. It does a good job of reviewing new airplanes, however it concentrates on the high end planes, and gives a good, but small, coverage of the latest (month old) aviation news. It also gives some touchy feely articles on flying from the corporate, private, technical, and professional aspect.I believe it is lacking in in-depth coverage of future systems, long term reviews of airplanes, and also, long term upgrades of older airplanes. When they do cover used airplanes, it is not in-depth like the new airplanes and they do not go into third party vendors for additional items as much as I would like.Overall, it is a good magazine, not great. I would still recommend it for one year to see if you like it also.PS - If you read it enough, I get the impression that they are overly conservative on safety yet in real life, I believe they fly normally."
3,Great storyline,In this game you play as Agent Thorn a CIA agent who has to complete several tasks to find to find a mole in the agencie an to find an assasin. Most of the tasks were too challenging and I found myself looking on the net for help. This is a great game for all who like conspiracis and espionage
3,Okay - But not for the novice,"Some of the information not directly involving the casting of spells can be useful information. However, as a novice, I found that most of the spells presented go against the Wiccan Rede, which I am trying to remember to follow. I have found books by Scott Cunningham and Lilth McLelland easier to understand and follow. This book is okay to have, but I don't expect to take it out and use the spells until I get more experience - and then only if I want the Three-Fold Law coming back on me."
3,DISAPPOINTING,"If you're a fan of the other illustrated James Herriot books, (Bonny's Big Day, Only One Woof, The Christmas Day Kitten, etc.) you'll be disappointed in this one. Rather than being another true tale from his days as a veterinarian, this is just a mediocre, fabricated story about a lost lamb which really doesn't fit with the rest of the series."
4,Excellent,"This is really a very, very good CD. It's hard to pick out highlights because all of it is of such a tremendously high standard.... except for just one of the tracks (""I Cover the Waterfront"") which has some incredibly bizarre flat singing in it. How on earth did that get left in?"
2,Too old!,"I think Corey has great routines, but this book is prettyoutdated. Give us some new material Corey.I wouldn't recommend this book."
5,wow impressive,"This game is just impressive. It looks great and there's so much quantity here and not always in the expected formats; For instance you can go bowling or play pool. Do not let the ""return to Liberty City"" statement scare you. This is not the liberty city we remember from GTA3 but a whole new much larger much better version of the same city (New York). The story mode is equally impressive as it sucks you right in to a life of an illegal alien fresh of the boat from Russia.Some elements that were present in GTA San Andreas are gone. You no longer have to work up the skills you need to play the game. Unlocking the other islands no longer seems like such a task because each is so huge. There is also an interesting ""hide behind cover"" mechanism which is very useful in gun battles (think gears of war).This is without a doubt the greatest game on the PS3 to date both in graphics and gameplay as well as the best in the series."
5,Simply Amazing,"GTA IV offers amazing graphics, great story line, and tons to do.The amount of content in the game is simply astounding. I could write paragraphs praising the game, but I think I simply write my only minor complaint.My only real criticism is the sound track is not as good as other recent releases,.. The talk radio is very good, but the music leaves alot to be desired."
5,"Don't Hesitate, buy it now!!","Simply brilliant!Even if you've played the other GTA series games, this may be more of the same but if it ain't broke then don't fix it, better looking with added capabilities!Call of Duty 4 aside, this is the best video game available on any platform. No doubt."
2,"Great mechanics, terrible story","I've played all the GTA's since 3. Loved 'em. Why? Gameplay plus story. The pinnacle was San Andreas. Awesome gameplay mechanics. Epic story that carried through during the entire game. What's missing in GTA 4? The story. Characters (Like Brucie and Little Jacob) are developed and then dropped almost entirely. Other characters (Roman and your old, now gay, friend) are simply annoying. There is no consistent ""bad guy"" / nemesis, per se. In San Andreas you had the corrupt cops antagonizing you from the first scene to the last, literally. Your Grove Street amigos, Woozy and others were woven into the story in meaningful ways throughout. GTA 4 lacks all of this. I felt disconnected from the plot and was simply ""driving over there, shooting some guys, driving over here, shooting some guys, driving back over there, shooting still more guys, and so-forth."" Worth a play through, but leaves you wanting much, much more."
1,Grant Theft Auto IV,Returned it unopened. Details on product indicated it was not an appropriate gift fora pre-teen. Wish more had been described on line at the time of purchase. Due to time frame I purchased a replacement game at a local game store. Paid twice the cost but saw a detailed description of itat the time of purchase.
5,best game ever!,"as anyone knows the gta games are great fun and this one is the best yet! however, the language and scenarios do not make this appropriate for children under 17 to play. as an adult though, i find this game very hard to put down!"
3,"Good Graphics, tiresome storyline, few weapons and limited amount of things to do in the game","The only improvement in this game from previous versions is the great graphics (however with very dull colors) and far better controls, LT/RT for shooting and driving."
1,Too violent!,I had to get rid of this game. It was too violent and the language was too much. Big turn off!
4,Very cool,This is a good game overall you can play it for a long time and there is no lag on the online game play
3,Not as good as San Andreas,"This game is not that good as some people say, the gameplay is horrible compared to previous versions. In my opinion San Andreas is way to much better, the only good thing about this game are the graphics and the story, nothing else"
4,gg,"i bought a ps3 just to play this game and i think its worth it but not after i beat the game, theres not much you can do after you finish the game, tho theres still the multiplayer and it still fun but the single player is kinda of useless now. but still its a good game"
2,Not worth the hype,"This games has great graphics but I felt like I was doing the same things over and over again. The storyline of this game sucks, it is not creative at all and to me it seems the makers were mostly interested in the graphics and cars, not the game itself. I regret buying this game, I was expecting it to exceed San Andreas but it failed miserably."
4,NICE GAME,The game still the line from the old ones but is better... it came with a lot of new stuff so you will never boring in this game... i recomend it.
2,Freezes on PS3 - Known problem - Do Not Buy!!!!,"It's only been out a few days and there have been many reports that the game freezes while loading just after the splash screen and during actual game play. I have the 60Gb version and have experienced both freezes. It's happened about SIX times thus far in two days. Some have said that using cheats causes the freezes. Although I use some of the cheat codes, all of the freezing has happened before I used the cheat codes a few hours ago.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL A SOFTWARE PATCH IS ANNOUNCED. The developer is well aware of the issue. You can search online in various forums [...]I've giving it two stars b/c I'm sure a patch will be released."
5,Ramayan - The Legend Of Prince Ram,"The story is probably most well known in the Hindu faith and probably told millions of times, but Mr. Yugo Sako, the director of this animation is nothing short of a genious. The animation is smooth, inviting and beautiful. The music is calm and euphoric and the story is masterfully captured highlighting all the major acts and well doings of Lord Ram. The story gives dimension to each character and the mixture of Japanese and Indian styles of drama are clearly seen in an almost magical blend.This is the best purchase I have ever made and it will be for a very long time. Natarajbooks also sent me a small calender and packaged was up to mark. The delivery was very timely and overall I am one HAPPY customer.The DVD has both English and Hindi audio tracks, with English and Hindi Subtitles.In short, if you want a piece of art, or movie to show the entire family or to have a better understanding of the Ramayan, this DVD is the ultimate sourceThank You"
4,Great video,"This film is an easy way for a non-Indian audience to connect with this very compelling story. It even contains the typical Bollywood music, which also gives this audience another taste of India. The choice of English voices is a bit much, however, and this is the reason my review is only four stars rather than 5."
3,Does not translate well as a stand-alone book,"I was excited to pick up a fictionalized account of Patty Hearst and her time with the SLA. I didn't live through that time period, and I have only a fringe knowledge of the events, but what a gripping premise, right?Wrong. I think this book is only a winner for SLA/Hearst-ophiles who can put the story in a larger context. It does not stand on its own at all. It is told from way too many points of view, and it takes tremendous concentration in the beginning of the book to remember all these characters and figure out why each one of them is narrating. I got bogged down in the switching-around and wanted the action to get started.Other reviewers have talked about the beautifully developed characters and scenes. I had the opposite reaction to the long inner dialogues and descriptive passages--I wanted Sorrentino to get along with the action already."
1,Bogus reviews???,I actually considered purchasing this until I read what appear to a number of literary-hip wannabe reviews presumably written by the author or his friends. The reviews certainly have the tell-tale signs of similar self-promotions that one finds increasingly often in Amazon reviews.
1,You Call This Blues?,"I hate this CD. I recently bought this album after finding out that Elvin used to be a member of The Paul Butterfield Blues Band. I have been a big fan of The Paul Butterfield Blues Band for a long time. I thought that this CD would sound similar to the older Butterfield Blues Band albums, but I was very wrong. This CD sounds more like a mix between George Clinton and The Allman Brothers. The sounds that come from this CD are awful. There is no blues feeling in this CD at all. I would not advise anyone to ever buy this CD."
2,DOES NOT FIT THE LXT MAKITA DIE GRINDER,"Totally worthless for me, who would if thought a makita product wouldn't fit a Makita die grinder... wayyyy over priced too... not even gonna return it waste of time. And i understand it doesn't specify that it fits this grinder, but i think that a company that makes die grinders should keep the same collet size for its own products! Otherwise Makita LXT series are some of the best tools out there and offer the largest variety if tools for one battery"
1,Unreliable,"This router worked fairly well for a couple of years and then suddenly stopped working properly, selectively failing to load certain websites. Every possible setting was tried, with the help of Belkin technical support, to no avail.What was most disheartening was the unhelpfulness of Belkin technical support. I must have spent literally hours on the phone with those people, to no avail. Each tech support agent read from the same script, and had no access to notes indicating my previous phone calls. None showed genuine interest in resolving the problem, even though they'd begin each call with the same cheerful scripted comment, ""I can help you with that!"" No they couldn't, as the problem was a hardware issue, which they are scripted to always deny.They were so unhelpful that I couldn't even get one of them to change my security key! One actually claimed it wasn't possible.Total junk, peddled by manufacturer that does not stand by its product."
1,Belkin F5D7230-4,"Hopefully, the time has long since past that this product is available on the shelf. If someone offers it to you used... run! Even for free this product is far more trouble than it's worth. I've had virtually all of the problems described in other reviews. Its range is poor. It drops connection regularly, particularly during heavy downloads. And since the cable modem runs through the router, a disturbance on the wireless network frequently results in loss of internet connection on my main desktop (which is connected by Ethernet). It seems to especially dislike Macs.Perhaps some have found that magic set of settings that leads to trouble-free use, but I suspect they have minimal wireless traffic to begin with."
2,Looks nice,"This Router lightweight and looks nice.Speed is not reliable.Some time broken connection.Looking to replace this router ,will buy any other brand."
2,A Comment about ON THE AIR.,"This CD contains selections from the large archive of""aircheck"" broadcast recordings made by Miller throughout the run of his radio programs. If you like to find alternate performance recordings, and already have other collections of broadcast performances, then consider purchasing this one. If you have never heard Millers' live performances, I would advise starting with other collections. Having heard these recordings as made by RCA Victor, I find these to be of mediocre sound quality.The editing of the cuts remove the end of some of the pieces.I would have expected better from the label that issued the excellent Abbey Road studio recordings of Millers' AAF band. ON THE AIR is a good CD for adding to a collection,but not for listening."
2,ok for dvd's,Install was fairly easy and the DVD player works well. The remote is hard to use as all the buttons feel the same and are arranged in a grid.If you plan to use the remote in the dark you need to turn on a light to see it first.The MP3 DVD/CD option is nice and the capacity to hold 1500 songs on a DVD is awesome. However the shuffle option is poor and it won't play songs listed higher than #250 during the shuffle. Even if you place the MP3's into folders it looks at all of them as they were loaded into one giant folder and stays below #250 during shuffle.The ability to play from an iPod and use the adapter works well.The touch screen has the ability to brighten and dim but the stereo face when the screen is closed is bright blue. It doesn't dim and is often distracting.All in all I like this product but think that it lacks a lot of the small things that would make it more user friendly.
5,Excellent album,"This early album from Frankie Moreno is wildly entertaining and enjoyable (you will NOT believe he produced this album when in his early twenties). It's a little bit funk, a little bit rock, a little bit salsa and maybe even a little bit of a number of other genres. Frankie Moreno has several albums available on this site and others (all of which I recommend). Give this album a try and you won't be disappointed!"
1,Very disappointed with this kit...,"I received this kit in the mail yesterday and it was in a sealed box... after removing the plastic wrap and opening it the first thing I see is the molded in windshield is bent out of shape to the point of it breaking if you bent it back! I then looked over the rest of the kit and find there are only three wire wheels, no tail lights and no review mirror...obviously this was a packaging error from the manufacturer... I called the seller who said they would refund my money with a business check, I am awaiting that... the rest of the quality of this kit is poor for the price you are asking for it, it is an old mold and has lots of flash, pock marks and seams also not many parts, no engine, etc... The shipping cost of $7 is way too much also for such a light kit... half the cost of the model? I would not recommend this kit to anyone...Minicraft Models 1958 TR-3A 1/24 Scale"
4,Good Introduction,If you are looking for a good introduction to what EDI is all about this is a good book to start with. Gives you the basic concepts of how EDI works and what you should consider before attempting to implement. This is not a technical book but it is good for a technical person who needs to have a basic overview of the material.
2,"Are we working out here, or are we watching MTV?","I thought I'd supplement some of my kickboxing tapes with DVDs. I'm sorry I picked this as one of my purchases. Besides having a dismal background, the video seemed to be filmed through some kind of fish-eye lens that distorted everything that was going on. I've never seen any professional video take this approach, and it absolutely doesn't work. I suppose if you belong to that set that likes MTV so much you don't care about getting a real workout, you might be impressed by the fact that the instructor seems to be small and her foot gigantic when it kicks straight at you, or you might enjoy the blurriness of the action. But if you're serious about getting a workout and prefer to skip dizzying effects that detract from what's going on, I'd pass on this video. Go for 10 Minute Solution: Knockout Body instead. It's got plenty of kickboxing moves in a professional format with five different 10-minute workouts."
5,Great work out video.,"I have many workout videos and this one is perfect for a 30 minute workout. Not a lot of jumping around, you do get winded in the first minute and feel like you want to quit. Great work out for cardio and conditioning."
5,great kickboxing workout,this is a great kickboxing workout. it is challenging but easy enough for beginners. the lady that instructs it is very encouraging and knows when to say the right things to push you along. i love kickboxing workouts and this one will be going into high rotation from my dvd library.
2,A Great Hook for Ally Fans,I bought this book for my boyfriend who is in love with Ally. He loves looking at the pictures. Enough said.
1,"This book has sex, sex, and more sex!","Now that I have your attention, let me begin by saying that every male character on the show is: emasculated, infantile and generally unattractive, (not that it should matter but since the show's humor draws so heavily upon that, it's relevant). Next, why does David K. need to write scripts on the level of 13yr olds? Why do we need references to sweat, baldness and obseity? Are these ""beautiful"" people so sheltered in their insulated little worlds; that when they venture outside they are reduced to giggles by a fat man? And why does everyone harp about her weight? Personally I have no problem with it, but, since she's on television and anorexia is epidemic nowadays she is a role model whether she likes it or not. And let's face it, she looks like a walking anatomy lesson. But hey, I didn't even read the book."
4,Great System,"After 4 years of daily use, this system is still going strong!I have played computer games, movies, and music software on a daily basis using this surround sound system and haven't found any flaws in the quality of sound. I will say that the bass setting has bothered some of my appartment neighbors and had to be turned down. The speakers are no hangable regardless of the fact that you can hang them. Mine fell down on more than one occassion and had to be left on the computer desk. The little feet that go into the speakers sometimes fall out when you lift the product, but overall do well in stabilizing the device. I would reccommend this product to anyone looking for a surround system on their computer, regardless of what software they were using. One of my best computer purchases hands down!"
4,A love through time,It was a very good story. A little slow at first but kept my interest. A very good historical romance.
4,A Love Through Time (MacKendimen Trilogy),Book was enchanting and exciting at the same time. The characters are unforgetable. You feel as if you were right there with them. Story was hard to put down. Loved every minute of it.
5,Great read!,One of the better time travel stories. Good story and good romance. Interesting facts about the time the main characters end up in. It also has an interesting twist.
3,Chico was a powerful man who helps his people and the forest,"This book is very educational. It helps you learn about a man who strives for what he wants. He wanted the tree cutters to stop cutting down his people's trees. The trees were rubber trees. And the town people are rubber tappers. In order for the people to go on with their lives they all needed the trees. Chico was a very patonate man, and we all should be greatful that he risked his life for the forest."
2,some cheap coasters,"I like the color and sturdiness of the coasters and you get plenty, but thewood trim design is very rough- we're planning on sanding and restaining them."
5,Beautiful Coasters,Very sturdy and beautiful coasters. They are very well made and look very pricey when you see them. Very happy with my purchase and definitely a great buy.
3,good buy,A good size and attractive design - works much better for me than what I was using before this purchase!
3,decent good looking coasters,"what's there to say, they are coasters. Would be nice to have a little felt on one side to not scratch my bar."
3,"Good-looking and sturdy, but lacking in coating","I gave these coasters 3 stars because, although I like them and based on the material think they will be durable (and they look nice enough), I think they could use a varnish coat because the wood is a bit rough on those blunt edges in the middle of the coaster. Beware of splints."
2,not worth it,"You can buy this product at Wal-Mart for 6.99! Why pay 9.99 plus shipping for something so cheaply made. The holder is stapled together and one of the sides has already fallen off once, so we glued it."
4,Lipper Bamboo coaster set,"Good set of coasters. You'll be satisfied. If you are doubting, you can still make more research. Amazon.com is a great seller."
3,Not Quite Good Enough,"Let me say that You Are My I Love You is a book which will forever be on my favorites list. I have purchaced a copy for every baby gift I've given in the past 3 years. When I saw that this book was being published I was so happy. Then I read the book, and was disappointed.I want so badly to say that this book had the same feel as the first one. I want to say that I purchaced a copy for everyone on my list. Instead, I did not even buy a copy for myself.The illustrations are as lovely as I had hoped, but the text seems forced, and the story simply does not flow in the same way. I am sorry that this book was not what I had hoped it could be."
3,From the Founder of the All-Movie Guide,"This is a grade-B, low-budget action flick. If you like films about Native Americans (as I do), then you may have the interest to wade through it, but otherwise look elsewhere for an action flick. Since I did watch it, you might as well have my comments: the lead actor and heroine are cool, and you get a liberal amount of enjoyment watching this band of reservation folk kick the tar out of the city slicker-mafia from NYC. I liked that. Just don’t expect a lot more than that and you can enjoy this. I love Charles Bronson films, so this fits right in.-- Michael Erlewine, Founder All-Movie Guide (allmovie.com)"
4,Source of inspiration,"I subscribed to Elle Deco hears ago. I love that magazine a lot and look every month for it to come! It is always pleasant to learn about artists, trends, architecture among other aspects that the magazine covers. I also appreciate to ""travel"" through various cities with infos on where to stay or buy products from a particular town. The articles are often clear, intelligent and the pictures of good quality. It a good magazine that I like to look back often and a source of inspiration."
1,rubbish,"I received my first issue and it's just rubbish. It's relatively thin for a magazine, and it's just full of advertisement and hardly any contents."
4,<3 Elle Decor,"I saw a mention of Elle Decor magazine on E! News, and it looked like such a great magazine for people interested in interior design and the art of home decorating. I had never heard of this magazine, and I'm glad I got a good holiday deal on it from Amazon."
2,To Ritzy,"Good Magazine, if you have millions of dollars to design your house in this manor. But cool to look at anyways, for the price."
1,A Piece of Junk,"This product is a piece of junk, so poorly constructed that the headband and operational parts have no solid connection. As soon as you put it on, it comes apart, a constant frustration. Perhaps the designers knew itcouldn't be worn long, so uncomfortable is it. It pinches the head, loses its adjustment, and the clamp at the end is hard and sharp edged, despite a piece of symbolic foam that's so hard it has no cushioning effect.The earphone (there's only one) is of low quality, and I couldn't get the mic to work. It broadcast only static on otherwise functioning CB radios from both the same maker, Midland, and from Cobra.It is the cheapest CB headset on the market, and for a reason. Don't waste your money on it.I also am displeased with the merchant who sold it. Though it was well- packed and quickly delivered, when I wrote them for a return authorization, I got no reply. They apparently didn't want it back.I can understand why."
2,Mine was broken...,"I divide my time between two time zones, so when I saw this watch, I figured it was made for me. The trouble is, it didn't work, right out of the box, didn't work.I gave it two stars because I still love the design, because other Skagen watches I have gotten work just fine and because it was easy to return and to obtain a refund for the product.So, if you get it, I wish you luck. Really, it looks very cool."
2,This is a circular saw case,"The box that this case comes in is labeled ""Circular Saw Carrying Case."" However someone at Bosch or Amazon put another label on the box that states it is the plastic carrying case for Bosch's random orbit sander/ polisher.A search on the internet for ""Bosch 2610968882"" shows that it is the case for Bosch 1654, 1655, 1657, and 1658 circular saws.This case can be used for the sander, but the inside is still molded for the circular saw, extra saw blades, and a guide."
3,"Not bad, but nothing like the rest of his stuff.",I have read all of DKM's works and this one has the least 'edge.' An interesting novel but nothing compared to the continuing time masterpeice.
1,They should call this the itty-bitty really expensive rip off package,First of all they LOOK in the advertisement like the old school scratch n sniff stickers I used to get as a child. In reality each sticker is about the size of the round tip of my pinky. SEE PICTURES.
5,Sentimental and heart-felt,"Ignore the one-star review, which fails to appreciate the fact that people CAN feel earnestly and honestly sentimental towards a great book. If one doubts the premise, then one cannot possible understand what follows. I can't blame the reviewer since we're constantly bombarded with dictates from the media that we must scoff at sentimentality as being ""trite"" or worse, and, armed with such indifference, one cannot be suprised by the angry review. This book is not intended to entertain, but to offer an insight into one man's love of great books and literature. To that extent, it succeeds wonderfully."
5,Beautifully animated!,"Beatrix Potter has captured children's hearts & imaginations with her books. Now on DVD 14 of her stories have been brought to life, with the animation based on Beatrix Potter's illustrations. A great addition to your DVD collection! When the stories start, children are mesmerised - silence reigns!Niamh Cusack is great as Beatrix Potter. You meet her at the beginning of the stories, & see how she got her inspiration for the stories as she's out painting in the Lake District. Lovely, haunting music adds to the pleasure of the viewing."
1,Get the BBC version instead !!!,"The 2008 BBC (3 dvds) version is pricier but it's a far better deal: the picture quality is much higher. This is art, please do not settle for less!!! I got them both, and I plan to give away this worse-than-vhs Goodtimes version"
3,Complete Beatrix Potter Collection 2pk,"Our sister in law gave us the video of the first story, when her kids outgrew then. My son was in trance everytime we played it, so I bought the collection. The way animation is drawn , music and the story, in quality deserves 5 stars. What brought down the ratings is that the menu is really not well planned ,we cannot skip the live action and it might be my DVD player (but only does this on these discs), I can never be too sure of what story I chose until the animation starts, because the intro to almost all stories are the same.If you are used to the video cassettes , the voices seems to have been redone (at least on the first story), but thats nothing major. In all if you want something well done and pretty quiet, this collection is a good buy."
4,Great Phone,"Excellent phone. This is my second in a number of years.Clear, easy to use and hands free.."
2,dissapointed,"at our house im always cooking for large groups of people and i love to try new things. I have grilled in the past and thought I would get tips from an expert so I purchased taming the flame. i read it from the beginning and then chose to cook chicken legs. I used the indirect cooking method that was reccomended and the kosher salt, pepper and olive oil as stated in the book. With a whole lot of confidence i put the chicken on the grill waited an hour and was ready to eat but the chicken was raw. thank goodness this was a trial run before the guests would be here the next day. The chicken was barely edible and had to be given to our 3 very happy dogs. The kosher salt had taken over the taste of the chicken,the entire batch of chicken was destroyed. I will try another recipe before I completely give up."
1,Time Thieves,Time Thieves is one of Dean Koontz's first books. It is absolutely horrible. This is the first one that I thought was bad.
1,"Not a Great Game, And a Bit Deceiving","First, there are similar games with better grahpics, like Myst. Second, upon playing the game I felt a bit betrayed. Nothing on the packaging indicates that this game has a specifically Christian outlook, but it becomes apparent upon play. Had I know, I wouldn't have bought it in the first place. Now that I have I suppose I'll have to sell it in an attemp to recoup something. The designers, et al, should have had the integrity to be honest about the slant of the game BEFORE unsuspecting people buy it and discover it for themselves. I've nothing against proselytization, but at least be up front about it so that I don't waste my time or money."
4,"Just Good and Okay, but not Excellent","I enjoyed playing this immersive adventure to Egypt--I am always fond of adventure games that incorporates mysticism and ancient artifacts.The puzzles presented in the game are indeed logical and can be accomplished without consulting a walkthrough. I loved the puzzles and walking around the Giza and the Cheops pyramids.My dissatisfactory comments goes to the graphics--something Dreamcatcher is notorious for. The sky graphics are inadequately designed with bands and the helicopter needs work to display the the realistic texture. The immersive experience of ""Riddle of the Spinx"" is 3 from a scale of 1 to 5. ""3"" because of the helicopter and the skies strips the immersive factors away from the game.If you can't wait for Myst 3: Exile, purchase this title to alleviate your impatience for Myst 3. I am certain that Myst 3 is what we adventure fanatics have been waiting for since Riven came out in 1997."
3,"Good game, but frustrating technical problems","First of all- to all you whiny reviwers complaining about the christian aspects in the game, SHOVE IT. you can call it ""religious"" if you want- I call it reality. Funny how nobody would complain if a game took up darwinist dogma or bought into pagan theology... Anyway, aside from the ending the only ""christian"" thing in the game is that some clues have been hidden in the book of numbers ( oh no! how terrible! get real.)My only problems with the game have been technical. I once got to the end only to discover my inventory had suddenly dissapeared. also whenever opening drawers or boxes a huge green rectangle appeared in the middle of the screen blocking most of my view and ocassionally crashing the game. I never did get to see the ending... arggg!..."
1,another dreamcatcher failure,"this is another failure by dreamcatcher. the only company worse than them seems to be cryo. i worried when i heard dreamcatcher had taken over this game, since their games are generally poorly designed and executed. however, i decided to give it a shot, since the game was mostly designed before they took over. BIG MISTAKE. the game crashed and reset system settings more than once. the game controls are primitive -- they are similar to games 2-3 years old. the graphics are a joke. check the sky -- heavily banded. there is more wrong, but suffice it to say: don't waste your money."
5,An inspired sim made with the Railroad Tycoon 2 engine.,"Imagine that you're the leader of a small South American country. Now you have to attract tourist, keep your citizens happy, set up industry, and help save the rain forest. That is the basis of Tropico. I liked Tropico because of its deepness and graphics. The game is much like an onion. It keeps adding layers to the basic core. For an example, each citizen has more than 50 characteristics, not to mention, a job and political convictions. Every person is different. The graphics are also top notch. The outstanding Railroad Tycoon 2 engine has been totaly redone. You see such details as clouds in the sky and people moving around. I recomend this game to any sim fan. I don't know if it will appeal to sports fans or not. Well, any way this game is a must get."
3,simcity meets sims on a tropic island,"it uses railroad tycoon 2's engine, be your own , every person on your island is affected by human stuff like hunger and thirst, environment around him(industries are bad for that and forests are probably good) 3 different ways to get money, tourism(a clean island with big beaches and lots of attractions)recourses(cut wood,mine stone and gold)and industries(this'll kill the tourism,but it's probably a lot of money)and there seems to be 3 groups of ppl on your island, military, peasants,and religious."
3,Tropico,"Well, I can describe this game as one of the tourists describes my island on the game. A nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live here. This is a very entertaining and fun game for a while, but the novelty wears off too quickly. It's just not much fun after your first few games."
3,Addicting,"Extreamly Addictive Game that made my play for hours and hours after I layed my eyes on it. Though, it becomes dull afterwords, but is a good addiction if you have no life."
4,SO GOOD,"Joe Keough is back with his partner Harriet. This time, they are dealing with a/or more serial killer(s). Killing of little children are happening in St-Louis and Chicago with strange coincidences.I LOVE the character of Joe Keough. This book is not chock full of action, but the author manages to describe the murder scenes with a vivid accuracy (without too much gore) and lets you feel as though you are seeing it yourself.The character of Keough is far from perfect and is, in fact, loaded with confusion. HIs heart is in the right place though and all he knows is that he needs to find the killer(s).As I said, there isn't a ton of action on every page, but Keough will walk you through these murders with a sharp eye and very interesting twists.This is a smart thriller and is absolutely worth the price of the book.Buy it."
4,Serial Killers Of Children In Midwest,Veteran detective Joe Keough and his partner Harriet Connors are recruited into the FSK to help solve the serial murders of young boys and girls in St. Louis and Chicago. The task force is an FBI offshot to find serial killers and consequently they meet resistance from the local police who want to protect their own turf and freeze them out of the information loop. The investigation is aided by an interesting FBI profiler Nicole Busby. It turns out that there were two killers involved and that they were twins that had been separated at birth who fell into the same pattern. Good solid read with a few unique twists.
5,Pandolfini's analysis is more than worth it! Nice collection,"As it is said, there are atmost one/two moves in a chess game that decides the fate of it, this book is a collection of such moves and such moments of the games where one move makes the difference.In many of the games Fischer is lagging pieces, the game suddenly ends while the opponents pieces helplessly watch (and some cased help by hindering the king move) while the kingdom crumbles down to its knees. I am not a pro, I usually lose against players with rating 2300 and above, many of the moves have been eye openers for me, while in all honesty some of the moves are very predictable.If this book creates a aura of Fischer never losing, I'll strongly suggest 'How to beat Bobby Fischer' in addition to this book."
1,"same reissue at Red Hot and Live, Summer Heat, ect","This is another bad reissue with a extra song as Red Hot and Live, Summer Heat, Platinum Collection. Save your money and avoid this poorly recorded concert."
1,Bright but short lived,"Dimmer switch has burned out within three months of moderate use. The lamp now is fully dim, always."
2,Very disappointing.,"In theory, this was the answer to a seeding that involved over200 pounds of seed. The adjustment lever kept popping over the adjustment nut and closing itself. We finally gave up trying to jury-rig it and started using a hand crank seeder and a dog food pan. IMO, not worth the money."
4,This CD is pretty spiff,"It's a really good album, maybe not for everyone's tastes but I think it's cool how SA can change their sound so much and still sound good."
1,Boring!,"This CD was atrocious. And thats why it flopped and nothing good came on Radio Stations and TV from Soul Asylum. I am a big fan of Soul Asylum but what is this mellow sh** they came out with. I am not saying they were kick in your face punk rockers, but some songs they have done are like punk or metal. Not even some songs, maybe 1 or 2 were like that. They should change to Hard Rock or punk because the songs that were heavy were cool like 99% and Miracle Mile."
2,"Needs more scope, less filler.","I know it's a classic, but it's way out of date. I got more out of your typical go-vegan pamphlet. The book focuses on animal suffering, not whether it is right to kill animals for food. I think the latter deserves some attention. There is also tons of fluffy filler. Singer's newer books, e.g. ""one world"" have much more content, and so I hope that he will return to this important topic soon with additional arguments and streamlined prose."
4,Mad Catz Rechargeable Power Pack with AC Adapter,"We have had this battery pack about 5 months and love it. It does take about 10 to 12 hours to fully charge as stated in the instructions. However, once charged, it will hold its' charge for days. Apparently this company is offering 2 colors, the see thru with yellow inside and the atomic purple color. We ordered it from Amazon.com and they shipped us the atomic purple one. We have had absolutely NO problems. We are buying another one since we have purchased another Game Boy for someone else in our home. My neice has the atomic purple one also. She has had it for about 6 months now and she has had no problems either."
3,So-so,"It's a nice theme, but what disappoints me are the songs ""Men in Black"" and ""Venus"". It would have been a little better, in my opinion, if the Chipettes sang the backup vocals of ""MIB"" instead of the usual. It's not bad, though (since I always listen to it, nonstop). ""Venus"" on the other hand, is one of my favorites too, however, the dialogue ruins the song. Other than that, a good album, worthy of buying."
3,A worthy purshase if you like a challenge,Oddessey is set after Homers story of Oddesyus's invasion of Troy. You start off in the ruins of Troy. You are shearching for Ulyseus. In the Troy camp you must speak with the commander. Then you go to find a man. The game is extreamly difficult and it has some strange camera angles and a couple placesthat there is an invisible wall and you have to press space bar in exacly the right place or nothing happens. I recomend buying the strategy guide if you the game.
2,a little better than beyond atlantis,"Beyond Atlantis was impossible. Odyssey is a little easier. What's bothersome is that both of these games contain ridiculous, illogical puzzles that are both boring and tedious! I'm fairly new to pc games, but these 2 titles (atlantis and odyssey) are annoying enough to make me stop playing adventure games altogether. Playing games is supposed to be fun, not tiresome. The Longest Journey or The Last Express are, without question,much better games than Odyssey."
1,A good reason to use the snail mail.,"My experience with Mailstation started over six months ago. Since then I have had less than two weeks of email service. Just a few of the problems have included a Mailstation arriving with a broken screen, six weeks of phone calls to finally prove the replacement did not, would not and never would work, a month waite for another replacement to find it was in shipping, two weeks later to find no record of replacement, etc, etc. One technique is never being allowed to talk to the same person twice. ""I will call you on Monday to verify it is working."" ""This will definitely fix the problem."" ""Sorry, you can not talk to a supervisor."" ""We will send you a refund in one month."" ""The refund will be posted in two weeks."" ""We have sent the refund to your credit card company but it will take them two or more months to post the refund."" ""The problem is with your credit card company. We have sent them the refund."" I do not think so.The Dilbert cartoon is Mailstation."
1,These stories will leave no impression on you.,"One decent story, following by 19 bad ones. A diarrhea of artful words and images; a constipation of plot and characterization."
1,Don't buy! manufacturer doesn't support it,"My family got this fryer, and at first we loved it. The oil filtering is a great idea, and the size was just right. However, when it breaks, you're screwed. The fryer stopped working (in less than 3 months with careful use and cleaning) and we had to go with the warranty and contact the manufacturer. Turns out, we have to pay to ship the broken part back at our expense and wait for a replacement. It'll taken 6 to 8 weeks!! $150 for a useless appliance that'll sit until they get around to providing a functioning part?!I've learned my lesson with these celebrity-endorsed kitchen lines. They cost far more for inferior products, than the traditional name-brands. DO NOT BUY THIS FRYER."
1,The Great Leaks,"Very bad design, leaked twice and what a mess!! Shame on you T-Fal!I saw many of similar events on the internets...I think I will use crazy glue to fix the problem."
2,leaky,"I bought this fryer over a year ago from Amazon - no complaints with Amazon. Emeril, however is another story. It fries just fine but when I drain the oil into the pan - yikes! I've cleaned up so much cooking oil in the past 2 months from the leaking basket. I think the lever used to adjust is faulty. Curse you, Emeril!!"
1,junk,Oil leaked all over the counter and has flimsy metal.What a waste for something with such a good ideal(oil dranage/storage container ).Would not recommend!
4,cooker,i already had one of these cookers and very proud of both. this cooker is not as well made as the other. (material is lighter)
1,Never worked!,"We read the directions and followed them EXACTLY; we kept getting error messages, the heating element did not get hot enough; we called customer service and got the run around which basically said we could return it to them, they would repair it and return the same one to us. Who wants a brand-new but repaired fryer? I am so disappointed in this since it was purchased as a Christmas gift which I now have to clean and return. Beware! This was a huge disappointment."
1,Stop getting hot before a year was over,"I bought this in Jan 2012, and in Sept or October is stopped working properly. I spent extra money on this so that I could keep it for a longer time. I loved the features on it and how easy it is to clean. But the oil will not heat up anymore. Ive had it sitting for 30 minutes or more and the oil will not heat up! Do Not buy product. I loved it until it stopped working. Very disappointed!"
2,Attractive but light weight,"This is a pretty, but very light weight book that showcases only 10 staircases in commercial projects - all in Europe. The book is a miniscule 64 pages cover to cover. It is also a small format (10""x9"") paperback.The introductory chapter on the history of the staircase including samples of current staircase types is the most valuable portion of the book and takes up 30% of its small volume. The remainder of the book is nicely illustrated with good photography, but there is just too little meat on which the intellect might dine. Too bad. The subject is an exciting one for anyone interested in this essential element of architecture."
5,AMAZING,"This is the best remote ever. It offers full control over the device, unlike the zune or ipod remotes which just do play pause, only problem is that these are very hard to find but if you can BUY ONE! Mine has worked flawlessly for years!"
4,here's the low down from A-Z,"-I love talking on the phone hands-free. Do dishes, work on computer, anything with BOTH hands free.-very comfortable ear/head piece (BUT the clip to keep excess wire from dangling around and catching on things is poorly done, and breaks easily)-I use this phone as my primary phone, so buying a 2nd battery is essential-1 yr warranty requires that you pay to ship your phone to them, but they send a new one back within 48 hours.-great key pad, and very lightweight-good range/distance"
1,Mute beeping is awful!,"Nice phone, EXCEPT -- it beeps when on mute. How are you supposed to stay on conference calls all day with that in your ear??? No way, Jose. Still looking for a better option."
1,The Nice Design Roped Me In Twice,"It takes a might cruddy product to induce me to write one of these reviews. Plantronics has hit that low mark with this little beauty. I have severe neck and shoulder problems and a phone designed like this one is a necessity. Ones with earplugs make my ears ache.I couldn't have been more pleased with the design! Small, comfortable. Clip-on the belt keypad. I could do anything while talking on the phone: wash dishes, dust the house, bathe the dog, etc. Gone were the neck aches.Well, that convenience doesn't last long! I've purchased TWO of these phones in the past year and a half, and after about 6 to 7 months, things go downhill in a hurry. The connection where the headset meets the keypad starts shifting and making all kinds of horrid noises. ""Screeching"" is a description that is too kind. I've had listeners on the other end howl in distress! When it's not screeching, the feedback is horrible, and the echoing is beyond the pale."
2,Plantronics CT10,"Plantronics usually makes quality products. This is not one of them. The case is sturdy and headset is ok. The battery is built into the belt clip which is mounted upside down for some who knows why reason? Then I tried it... audio came howling back into the earpiece like an echo, similar to the original cordless phones 20 years ago. Totally unacceptable!! Back it went and replaced with the new Plantronics CT12 and its GREAT! Totally different, regular type lithium battery and sounds and talks great! Well worth the little $ difference."
3,"Great sound, some drawbacks","My voice comes through very clearly to others -- they have no idea I'm on a headset. The voices I hear through the headset are a bit muted.The phone is great overall. The only major drawback is that it's not ideal if you live in a small place and only have a single phone. THe phone unit is tiny, not great for quick dialing. and if you just want to answer the phone quickly or make a quick call, it's a pain to put on the headset. I'd prefer if the attached phone were a bit bigger and could be used by itself."
4,"Nice little phone, but low volume","I used this phone in a work environment - in a computer room.It is very lightweight and easily clips on, thus making for easy mobility while at work.The recpetion was great, and I didn't hear any static. The phone was very durable (ie. I dropped it, the back came off, and when I reattached it - the other caller was still on the line).My one, and only complaint, is that the volume was too low. I attributed this to my being in a noisy environment, but in order for me to hear, I had to press the ear piece tighter onto my ear (which, of course, somewhat defeats the purpose of having a headset)."
1,Can't see it...,I purchased this on the basis of a couple of great reviews I'd read... and couldn't make it through the first episode.
2,Not for Sensitive Skin,"I have sensitive combination skin that leans oily, with mild acne. So I can't just ignore the acne element to my skin, but I can't really use acne products because the irritation causes my skin to break out even worse. This product gets really great reviews, so I would say if you've got oily or combination skin, and it's NOT sensitive, give this a try. The ingredients look good for treating acne. Unfortunately, for me it didn't work out, and I got all kinds of breakouts when I was using it."
5,i love it,I love Anberlin. I love Anberlin. I love Anberlin. I love Anberlin. Just 2 more words required. And we're done.
4,At the Center of Art,"In German, the two words ""An Berlin"" means ""at Berlin""--a center of art and culture in the European world. The band bearing this name does not fail to bring this to light. They play with such honesty and diversity that it gets quite addictive. Without any shame in masking the same tracks on different songs, the band forms their own unique sounds with seemingly-improvised guitar riffs and amazing drums. Lead singer Stephen Christian has an amazing voice not often found in the record-label cookie cutter bands of the day. With obvious influences ranging from The Cure to Jeff Buckley, this eclectic creative experience is unlike any other. Addictive, but like most addictive things, after taking too much of it, you'll go on hiatus for a week or so from listening to their music--only reason they didn't get five stars."
4,Great cd,"I heard ""Change The World"" on Air1. At first, I wasn't impressed because they sounded just like everyone else in the Christian music industry. Then, I went to a concert where they were playing random songs over the air while the band set up. ""Cadence"" came on and I couldn't figure out where I knew the voice from but I really liked the sound of the song. I asked some friends who asked the sound tech and he informed me that the band was Anberlin. I looked them up on the Internet and to my surprise, it was the same band that I didn't care too much for.They definitely deserved the second listen!"
1,Poor Copy of Timelapse,"_Riddle of the Sphinx_ is a bad game. The clues are either silly or illogical - all culminating in an unoriginal and preachy Sunday school conclusion. I was very surprised that the credits immediately thank Jesus for his help in creating this EGYPTIAN setting from a JEWISH story. One would do much better to buy _Timelapse_, which is an interesting story, covering similar topics without the proselytizing. Throughout _Riddle of the Sphinx_ the player is seduced by the promise of visiting other locations. It fails here again, where _Timelapse_ succeeds beautifully."
4,An entertaning account,"While I wouldn't rate this title as the best historical account of the First World War in Africa, I did find it to be an engaging, fast paced book. The author's depiction of British Naval Commander Spicer-Simson's eccentricities made the book worth reading at least from the stand-point of entertainment. The author also develops the connections or lack thereof between the historical campaign and the ""African Queen"" novel and movie. This book provides a lively introduction to the African campaigns. I recommended Charles Miller's ""Battle For the Bundu"" and Edward Paice's ""Tip and Run"" for further reading."
1,Very Disappointed,"I am using this text for a managerial economics class for MBA students. I selected this text because it includes chapters on statistics, linear programming and risk, which I am covering in the class. Unfortunately, it is filled with errors - typos, incorrect formulas, and misrepresentation of basic economic concepts, such as derived demand. Some of the typos and other mistakes make concepts very confusing for the students. I am extremely disappointed. I expected much better from a book that is the eighth edition. I do not understand how it went to print with so many mistakes. I have contacted the publisher. I will not be using this text again."
1,Did not work.,"From the first tube to the last, it did not work. For years I've used other darker shades without any problems, but this one just washes out. Another unpleasant surprise, when I open the tubes about 1/2 the contents just blow out. Not sure why, maybe because I live at 6,000 ft elevation. Noticed there neither was an expiration date on any of the tubes or boxes, could be the stuff is old or some phony Chinese copy-kat import."
3,Cute,"My nephew had seen one of the Treasure Buddies films at preschool and loved the movie that features man's best friend. I, of course, jumped at the chance to receive a review copy to watch with my favorite little man. I went over to his house and after playing for a little bit, he was ready to relax in the living room. I put in Treasure Buddies and he had to hold on to the case while we were watching.Overall, he really enjoyed this movie. The only thing he wasn't too thrilled with was the monkey. He kept saying ""doggie, doggie"". Finally, I realized that if dogs weren't in the picture, I was supposed to fast forward. Even though I did end up missing some parts of the movie, what I did see was absolutely adorable.Disclosure: I received a free copy of Treasure Buddies for review purposes. All opinions expressed are 100% my own."
3,kid movie,"I think these ""buddy"" movies are awful but my 5 year old likes them! Nice to rent/buy and have on Kindle Fire for road trips!"
2,Worst So Far,I am a big fan of Goldens and LOVE the Air Bud movies and the first few Buddies movies. This one is by far the worst. It seems to me that no thought was put into the story line at all. If this is the best they can do then it is time to let Buddy and his offspring rest in peace. Two stars is generous. I enjoyed the movie a bit because they still are cute little Golden puppies.
2,TIME FOR THE KENNEL,"After viewing TREASURE BUDDIES, one thing is clear: you can only take so much cuteness. Disney really needs to let this franchise go. I think even kids don't find the pups that interesting anymore? Even the addition of Babi the monkey doesn't help much since his cuteness wears thin. I know--I'm just a grumpy old coot but still an avid movie fan who likes an entertaining family film. After all, we're the ones who buy them!I generally enjoy Richard Riehle and Edward Hermann, but their characters and dialogue are just poorly written. The dog voice characterizations are generic and uninspired and interchangeable. Adding CGI effects to the black demon cats is embarrassingly bad. Kids today are more cognizant of good effects thanks to Harry Potter and Captain Jack. The ""buddies"" may have seemed lucrative at the time but enough is enough. An animated run on Nickelodeon might be more practical."
1,Eh.,"EH, where do I begin. These dident work good at all, and not really sure why. but I do know I wont order them again,"
1,Does not work,I tried to test my drinking water and the paper field to change colors. I also try to test apple cider vinegar and it also failed to change colors.
2,not neutral,Works well for strong acids (3 or less) and bases above 8.Not able to determine difference between pH 4-7...
3,"Cheap, and not accurate","You get what you pay for. These are tiny, tiny, not accurate (the pH of water is 7, but this sets it at like a 4) - if you are using this for a science project, don't. Buy the more expensive kinds if you plan on having some kind of accuracy. These all just looked like the color of the 'stick' just wet looking, almost everything we tested was between a 2 and a 5... even when we knew the pH balance of some items, like water, coffee, etc... strips are only about 1 1/2 inches, if that. Beware."
1,waste of money,These strips are the same color no matter what you put them on. I know how to use them and they do not work.
1,Buyer beware,I agree with the reviewers that advocate purchasing an S-video cable but warn about the quality of this particular product. I attached one to my PS2 and it worked for about a week before the picture became a grainy black-and-white. Luckily the unit was not ruined. Save a headache and but a better quality cable.
5,Mary Oliver: Living American Legend,"Few works stand across generations lighting the best American writers. Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass, and Mary Oliver's The Leaf and The Cloud, are two. The difference is that Oliver is alive and working today. I rejoice in her bravery to write the real work, that because it is real, lush, sensual, and drives deep into an open reader's soul like the tendrils of exuberant vines, will likely endure for future generations as long as humans do. Remember that Whitman wasn't completely embraced in his era either, and many opinion makers expecting whatever they were expecting, turned on him as did James Harlan, Secretary of the Interior, after the Civil War.The best advice is to form your own opinion. Borrow a copy of Mary Oliver's The Leaf and The Cloud, read it. If you respond to it as I have, you will be buying your own copy of a living American legend."
4,Challenging puzzles...on poor paper,"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers--the paper quality makes it difficult to use an eraser. Also the grids are very small, so putting in trial numbers is very difficult.Sudoku-book publishers of the world, here's my recommendations:1) Use decent paper, stuff that doesn't wear away with erasing or has ink seeping thru.2) Make the grids big (6 inch by 6 inch, for example).3) Make the book such that each page lays flat, perhaps by using a spiral binder.4) Reinforce the back cover of the book, so that one can do their sudoku while wedged into a tiny seat on public transportation.Meanwhile, do what I do: go to Michael Mepham's website: [...] and print out big blank sudoku grids. Fill them in with the starting numbers from the book and start solving!"
2,probably would pass on this one,"not a very entertaining book, just some words for a few toys, lots of better books outthere for toddler/babies"
1,"Disappointing, Blank CD!!!!","I bought this CD along with a couple others as a stocking stuffer for my mother. She goes to play it and its blank, how embarrassing. I am completely disappointed with you Amazon. Seriously a brand new CD doesn't even work."
2,As exciting as watching paint dry...,"If you absolutely love naval warfare circa 1800, then this game should be tolerable. However, if you like a game with pacing, then skip this turkey by. Yes, it does have lovely graphics and the attention to detail is admirable. But it all boils down to maneuvering your ship(s), firing your cannons, then waaaaaaaiting for the reload so you can fire another volley. That's the whole game. One-on-one battles are decent to kill 15-25 minutes, but multi-ship battles are nearly impossible to manage.Summary: buy this game if you LOVE naval warfare from 1775-1815, otherwise, skip this."
5,Pure Relaxation,I heard this CD in my yoga class during Shavasana. This CD helped my body continue to let go of tension and melt into the mat. I bought this CD to listen to while I go to sleep. I highly recommend this CD for anyone who needs/wants to relax and may have too much stress in their life. Enjoy!
2,dissappointed,"it says it is for inline cva muzzleloaders but it truly is for only a few models that cva has, not all inlines. I contacted the company that sold them on amazon and they really don't care to help. so i feel like i am kind of stuck with sights i can't use. so be careful. these sights are for optima,wolf,and kodiak cva rifles only. i would say to buy them from a known gun source that you trust not amazon."
4,Good hard rock album,"This is a really good album to listen to , it has a mix between hard rock tunes with good vocal melodies.The song that blew my mind is Mother Mary it sounds very modern . Just try and buy this album!!!!"
3,"Some issues, but overall a decent set for the money.","If the track is the slightest bit uneven, the cars behind the engine have a great tendency to derail. This is because of their relatively lighter weight. Other than that, it runs fairly well. The power-loc track is ridiculously easy to put together. Nothing like the standard track that came with the older sets and most sets today."
5,"a ""how-to"" manual and more","Among the relatively few books available that focus on getting science grants, ""Getting Science Grants"" is unquestionably the very best of the bunch. Blackburn has the perfect mix of credentials (college professor, research scientist, grants officer) to craft this concise treatment of the whole enchilada, from concept development through proposal writing, revision, submission (and resubmission), and grant administration. Giving frank, qualified advice in friendly prose, the author succeeds in creating more than just a ""how-to manual"" for scientific proposal writing. In roughly a hundred pages, this book shares insight on the science research funding process that would only be acquired by a decade or more of study in the school of hard knocks. As one whose career success is significantly influenced by external funding success, I couldn't recommend Blackburn's book more strongly."
2,Mediocre Album,"This is a pretty lackluster album and is pretty much what is wrong with most country music albums today: Good singles, mediocre/poor ""filler songs"". Wait for ol' Ty to release a greatest hits collection."
4,Talented. No other words can describe.,"Rufio is a group of young guys who possess loads of talent. They play a jaw dropping brand of fast paced punk with technical chord changes that you won't believe. ""Perhaps I Suppose"" combines break neck riffs with smooth, ranging vocals; to get a good idea what these guys sound like, take Starting Line or NFG and combine them with the musical elements/talents of Strung Out. Alot like Slick Shoes' ""Burn Out"" but much more infectious and catchy. Rufio put alot of time into writing these songs and they deserve some applause for it, a very worthy effort. If you are looking for some engaging music that ranges from blood pumping to poetic; but always overwhelmingly talent induced, buy ""Perhaps I suppose."""
4,"Rufio - Perhaps, I suppose...","When I heard the first song on this album, I thought to myself, ""Blink 182, Blink 182, Blink 182"", however I have to admit, their music, though not as well produced on this album, is definately much more exciting than that of other pop-punk bands. The guy's voice, meh, it's ok, I guess it suits that whole scene, but the riffs and drumming are quite excellent, and despite being a pop-punk band, their songs aren't all exactly the same as the last. So there is some variety in this album, whether you are listening to the melodius ""One Slowdance"" or the more somber ""Face the truth"" you're gonna be able to tell the difference. Though despite this, they are just a bit to light for me. Being a Clash fan and a Jam fan, these guys just don't have the raw energy those guys have, so it's definately more pop than punk. At the end of the day the album title is kind of suiting to the album, should you buy it? ""Perhaps, I suppose..."""
5,one slowdance,need i say more? this band is a mix of NFG and mest. possibly even bowling for soup. pop-punk. they're so good. i highly reccomend them. normally i hate it when bands sell-out. but these guys deserve to hit the big time.
4,Jack3D energy without caffeine,"Nitric Boost gives the desired effect of expanding your blood vessels allowing for better circulation. While exercising, I notice a big difference with the improved circulation of blood."
1,ON Nitric Boost,"Really not a fan of this product, I feel like I wasted my money. I don't notice any ""pump"" or increase in vascularity as I do with regular capsules. If you want a product like this, just buy L-Arginine 1000 capsules. You'll save a bunch of money and likely have a better effect."
3,A little ackward,"The bowls are beautiful, almost for display. I bought them for dry measuring which is ackward with this set. It also doesn't have 1/3 c measuring. They are probably perfect for prepping."
1,A square blanket? why waste the money?,"Yes it's a cute print, but who cares? it's still just a square blanket thrown off by my little boy in less than twenty minutes. Don't waste your cash."
5,awesome!,"This blanket has been a lifesaver! Its size is what sets it apart from other blankets. It is very difficult for my 2 month old to get out of her swaddle, which is important because she can't sleep without being swaddled. She can now sleep up to 5-6 hours at night (though doesn't regularly, but hey she is 2 months old!) where before she would awaken evey 1.5 hours or so even though she wasn't hungry; her arms wake her up and she has a stronge startle reflex. I would absolutely recommend this blanket and this will be what I give at all baby showers from now on."
4,Well written and intelligent,"Having seen the movie Smoke Signals before reading this book, I was somewhat familiar with some of the characters and the situations. That didn't detract from the enjoyment of this fine piece of fiction. The mythical references flowed well with the reality (as I believe it) of life on reservations. The characters were unique but totally believeable, and Alexie did a seamless job of melding even the most over-the-top symbolism into the narrative. I would highly recommend this book to fans of Native American and music history as well as anyone who has a taste for engaging, intelligent fiction."
5,The Native Struggle,This is a brilliant example of Native American literature. It has a magical sense of the Indian experience. This book keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. I had mixed emotions towards the characters and the effects. Sometimes it would make you want to laugh and other times it would make you feel saddened. It gives you the reality of the Native American people which is usually blown way out of proportion by movies and t.v. shows. After reading this novel it gave me an interest in Native American literature and other Sherman Alexie books. I would reccomend this novel to anyone looking for an adventure through an exciting cultural experience.
3,Very helpful for beginning archivists,This book deals with the practical rather than the theoretical. I found that to be very helpful.
4,simple and useful,"I am almost completely satisfied with my Plantronics T10 Corded Headset Phone. Some static occurs when the phone is used near other electronic items. That may just be unavoidable. The only slight handicap is the lack of a caller ID viewer. Otherwise, a very good phone. I am totally enjoying it."
4,Good Product Great Price!,"I enjoy using this product! It works great for my home business. Although, I experienced feedback every once in a while, I'd say it was still a great price for the product!"
1,Poor Quality,This is a very cheaply made phone that is overpriced. The soud quality is poor. Don't waste your money!
2,Radio Station Noise,"This phone has worked modestly well for me except for the fact that it picks up a local radio station well, which at times has made it hard at times to distinguish the radio from the person talking on the line if their voice is very quiet. Too make matter worse - it's a talk radio religious station."
3,noise reduction,"The headset is suppost to be ""noise reduction"" however I think they forgot to put that in the headset I recieved. It helps to put tape on the outside hole and I also put a mic cover over it which also helps, that being said the noise reduction does not work on the one I recieved and works better after I ""fixed"" it."
1,Bad,This phone has a real bad humming sound coming from it that makes it real hard to hear the customer and really hard for the customer to hear me.
1,Marginal quality,The 1st unit from Amazon had a buzzing noise-called Plantronics who told me it was the fault of the mic-they sent me a refurb unit which had the same problem. Then the buttons on the last column quit working-called them again-they are sending me another unit-should receive it 11/12.
4,Decent Headset Great for W@H,I Had to buy a Headset for my W@H job and found this product to be a great fit. Its comfortable (except the over-the-ear attachment) and easy to use. I did have some issue at first when trying to hear however the volume adjustment was able to fix that right away. Its very convenient and I would definitely recommend this product to anyone in the W@H Customer Service industry.
1,junk,Don't waste your money buying this phone. I had it for 2 weeks and it just stopped working for no reason. I contacted plantronics for a replacement and they sent me a refurbished replacement. As soon as i plugged it in to use it it had the worst sqealing noise. How frustrating! If that wasn't bad enough they sent me a second replacement phone and it squeels too! Three if these phones and none of them are useable. I bought this phone for work and it has been nothing but a headache. Their products are junk. Don't buy this phone.
2,Picks up interference,"Picks up a lot of static and radio station interference. Apparently a big complaint with Plantronics, as they address the issue on their website... which they say to fix is to move the box to another area. Not a great solution when you can't move the rest of your desk."
2,Hum on the Line,"I bought this phone because I use it in my job as customer service rep. This phone has had a humming noise on the line since day one. I even had the phone company out to check my lines, they say it is the phone. I cannot deal with this noise. I would not recommend this phone if you need an absolute clear line."
5,Dorothy Truscott Bid Better Play Better,"This book explains bridge in a simple manner and the information that my partner and I (she lives in Dallas and we play on Bridge Base Online) have utilized from this book has improved our game, and our understanding of it. It is in sync with the bridge lessons I have taken from my genious and excellent educator bridge teacher Bob Hinkle in Tucson Arizona."
4,Everyone should buy this game!,"I think that this game is great! The graphics are awsome and it's addicting. The only thing that I don't like are the dumb sounds that the men make when there getting healed. For example: ohhhhhhh, or eeeeeeeeeee! I think they should fix that! Other than that it is an awsome game!"
3,Should have been better,I get the feeling all of the artists record labels held back releasing any really good stuff. You get some tasty work here though. Worth adding to the collection.
4,A*****,"Love it - Super quality. Too small though for NZ plates so wont fit on car, which is a bit of a shame but daughter loves it anyway...."
3,Fun.....to a point,"I purchased the first two volumes of the Blair Witch game series and while I am impressed with the graphics and gameplay, the programs themselves leave alot to be desired. Both games were playable to a certain point and then a bug would come into play. The game would crash, and I am left frustrated. Going on the developers website revealed no patches, but reading the past chat forums told me I am not the only one with the crashing problem and there are other gamers who are equally frustrated. I seldom buy PC games but since I am a fan of the ""survival-horror"" genre I gave them a try. However, with the problems I have experienced with these two I understand now why the typical gaming platforms i.e Playstation, Nintendo, etc, are far more popular then the PC. Which is a shame because the power a PC has to offer is much more substantial. But since I have never been playing a Playstation game and had it shut down on me in the middle of play, I think that is what I'll stick to....."
5,SCARY AND CREEPY,"I have played many horror games and definately feel that ""blairwitch 1"" scores heavy over other horror games.the game is set on the 1941 legend of rustin parr who had murdered 7 children and claimed he had done it for a ghostwoman.the excellent atmosphere and graphics make this game realy spooky.though it doesnt have the best controls,it is a must buy for horror and blairwitch fans like me.i would rate it much higher than the other two blairwitch games.so if u want to visit burkitsville woods,this is definatelty the east way..."
1,What a terrible book,I have to say that I hated this book. I have read some of the authors other works and found them entertaining but this book was not. The entire idea of wooden sailing ships in space just makes me cringe. This is a fantasy book that is trying to grab some sci-fi readers by saying it is about galactic conflict. If you feel the need to read somthing by this author find a fantasy work and stay away from this piece of garbage.
4,Doll Anatomy,Looking through the book I see a lot of potential for meto be a doll maker and I can hardly wait to get started.
3,Not what I wanted.,"I wanted baby doll patterns and it turns out it has none. Disappointing,, but still interesting to look at. OK."
1,Not good,"The footage starts off with a redneck woman shooting a turtle after watching peaceful scenary. I'm sorry, but there is nothing cool about animal cruelty."
1,Very Laggy and Boring,"If you don't have a newer computer this game will be terrible for you. Although it only requires 128 mb this game is extremely glitchy and laggy even if you have 256mb. I also found this game very boring and repetetive. The first part of the game is very boring, all you do is drive people around. This game also has terrible AI, if you almost run someone over they will jump back and then continue walking. Not like in GTA3 when they start running away. The cars are bad too, if you park in the middle of the street they will just stay there they won't go around. I have a Gateway ME and I tried playing this game and its just to glitchy and laggy which ruins the fun. However I'm sure its fun if you can afford a brand new computer with a great video card and 1000mb of ram."
5,Simply the best.,"I got this game the day it came out. I gotta tell you, it is genius. The graphics amazing, game play outstanding, it is the best. I'd have to say, this game is better than GTA3 for PS2. The realistic game play clobbers the rest. I reccomend this to anyone, anyone with a fast computer. I say this because the graphics can become choppy if you don't have a fast enough computer. When i brought this home i played it, and next thing i knew 4 and a half hours had gone by. Get this game!"
5,Beautiful....,"When I bought this game I wasn't quite sure that I was going to enjoy it. Reason being, that I heard it completely copied GTA3 and Vice City, which are both great games. I began to play this game and I was amazed. Let's begin with the graphics. Jesus Christ! They're amazing. People's expressions and movments are totaly fluid and life-like. The voice acting is great, not mellowdramatic or overdone in any way. The game it self. Perfect! You play as Tommey Angelou a cab driver who accsidently gets wound up in the Mafia of Chicago(im guessing the location). The plot is simply amazing. The end is incredible. It's literaly like playing a movie. All in all, this game is a masterpiece, my favorite game of all time, and one of the best games made so far. This game is rated M due to sexsual references, violence, blood, and language."
5,best game ever,"This is by far the best game ever its been a year sence i beat it and im still thinking about it its like whatching a gangster movie with a love scene and everything.And its so realistic in games such as gta3 running a red light or anyother traffic violation is totally ignored in this your given a ticket even for speeding wich makes it(buy mafia) just like a real 30's world and the cars are incredable they're all real old cars and they run like real old cars so if your used to playing gta3 where the cars turn on a dime then(buy mafia) it may take some getting used to but when you do it becomes as easy as(buying mafia) tying your shoe. i loved this game so much that ive turned into a mafia fanatic and have rented all the old gangster movies and i am reading ""The Godfather"" im sure you'll feel the same way so belive when i say this is(buy mafia) the greates game ever"
3,If you like Counter-Strike or GFAII read this,"The graphics are great. The cut scenes are great. The story is great.So what's wrong with it, well you spend 75% or more of your time driving through the city from place to place. This would be fine, but driving isn't at all hard or challanging. Other cars will stop if you cut them off, you rarely get in accidents and the police are easy to get away from.The people in their cars don't even say anything cool if you cut them off or run into them.The fps part of the game is okay. It's definately not counter-strike materials, but overall from a guy who plays counter-strike every day, it's good.There is one bad part which is a race you have to do about 25% into the game. It is so hard that I've heard MANY people are downloading the save game after the race from the Internet. I've played a zillion games and it took me forever to finish the race. So if you buy this game get ready for some major frustaration.If you don't like driving games DONT BUY THIS GAME."
3,GTA3 it ain't,"There are alot of valid comparisons between this product and the groundbreaking, genre-redefining GTA3. Sadly, Mafia does not live up to the new precedent set by Rockstar's masterpiece. While you can roam Lost Heaven for hours, the game gives you no reason to do so. You can't jack any vehicle anytime, you can't rob from pedestrians, there are no mini-games or sub-missions, the vehicles are unfortunately realistic (slow, hard to control). In short, Mafia doesn't allow you to stray from the main storyline to cause as little or as much mayhem as your heart desires. This freedom to roam (and plunder) was what made GTA3 the game to beat."
2,DRIVE you crazy!!!!,"This game should have been called ""Mafia-The Chauffeur""You spend more time driving from one rediculous task toanother. If you like driving games, then this is one for you.This game could have been great if you did more than drivefrom one end of town to the other. You face endless attemps todrive against the clock. Real Fun-Yeah Right! Save your money!"
1,At $5 Not Worth the Drive Space,"From the ridiculous race to the bare handed fight against a crowd, not worth the drive space. Really. Not worth the drive space."
1,"Defective, needs to be recalled","This game won't install on my new AMD 3500+ cpu, it freezes during disc 2. Purchase with extreme caution."
5,Enormously Entertaining,"Like Grand Theft Auto III, this game takes place in an ""open-ended"" world, meaning you can travel to various places in an immense map, and that there is more than one solution to each mission. The plot is more linear than GTAIII- you can't really pick your missions in random order- but it also has a more interesting storyline. The graphics are amazing- nearly cinematic in quality. This game does take place in the 1930s, so the cars aren't as fast and the guns aren't quite as loud. Some of the settings are beautifully rendered- the cathedral and the art museum in particular standout to me. Once you finish the game, you've have access to the entire map in ""Freeride"" mode, as well as numerous silly and over-the-top missions in ""Freeride Extreme"". Between Mafia and GTAIII, you'll have two games with a lot of replayability, and I'm certain that both will rank as video game classics. Buy this game!"
2,"Teeth Whitener, good product, but can be hard on gums.","I have used the milder 15% concentration of Opalescence without a problem, but the 35% solution burned my gums within minutes of its use. I'll need to order the product sold for sensitive gums, or a lower concentrated version next time."
5,OPALESCENCE REVIEW,fELT THE OPALESCENCE GEL REFILL KIT WAS DELIVERED IN A TIMELY MANNER AND MUCH BETTER PACKAGING WITH THE CORRECT % UNLIKE LAST VENDOR.
2,***CAUTION*** Gel Works but Burns a Ton,"The boilable trays work OK but you need to keep in water for 10-15 seconds for a better mold. Used 3/4 syringe the first time and needed to remove within minutes. Tried again with 1/2 syringe as it was OK but still burned a good deal. Caution - if you do not have good mold or get the gel evenly placed, your teeth will whiten unevenly AND your gums will turn ghost-white. Seriously, ghost white and you will need to chill a bit to give your gums time to turn back to red. Likely an excellent product but definitely WAY too strong for the average user. I have head the 15-20% work better and more uniformly. I also tried the Aquafresh pre-filled molds and had great suggest. I loke this product, but again, the 35% is WAY too strong for the average user and the white gums are both shocking to look at and painful in the process."
5,Try i want to read the next one!!!!!!,"I have read Virtual War and The Clones and until I read these books I never really was interested in science fiction, but now I have started reading more of it. I loved both of the books I couldn't put them down, my whole school loved the books. Now I'm waiting with increasing excitement to read The Revolt, I am going to read it the first day it comes out . These books are great even if your not sure about science fiction you should try them"
2,Cheap,"It fits nicely over the bike and packs tightly into my backpack. However it has rips in multiple places already, and I have only had it for a month. Also the bottom melted to my header pipes but I guess that was my fault."
1,"Great Stories, Horrible Translator","The late Ted Gorelick's translations of Sholem Aleichem's monologues figure in a long list of disservices done to Yiddish literature and culture in recent years. Where Sholem Aleichem writes in an inexhaustibly stylish, idiomatic, quotable Yiddish, the efforts to replicate his fluency come across as awkward, patched-together, and completely removed from English as it's spoken anywhere in the world today. Moreover, his efforts to replicate the voices of uneducated, lower-class Jewish women of Eastern Europe--always the most dramatic, comic, and memorable of Sholem Aleichem's characters--come across like a vaudeville performer in drag and in blackface: an offense simultaneously to the Yiddish original and to the English reader. The cumulative effect of this depressing and unreadable collection suggests that Ted Gorelick in fact must have hated the Yiddish language. I KNOW that he hated the English language. What were the editors of this series thinking?!"
5,Halogen Torcheire Floor Lamp with Dimmer Switch,Works as advertised - lots of lighting (indirect) for our office.
4,Modern Halogen Torcheire Floor Lamp with Dimmer Switch and Free 300W Bulb Included in White Color,Very good fast
2,Not all the best of Disco music is included here... Beware!,"As a soundtrack compilation made by Sony/CBS, this CD should include all the original, FULL-length versions of Disco megahits as Cheryl Lynn's ""Got To Be Real""... But it doesn't.Best track of the album is ""The Love I Lost"" by Harold Melvyn and The Blue Notes. The rest... Just disposable!"
1,Misleading for those who knows. Enriching for those who dont or dont mind.,"This book is a shining example of a lack of understanding of the orginal Sun Zi's art of war in terms of its chinese language and contexts.Calling Sun Zi a sissy might have improved its attention and sales in the short-term, but readers familiar with Sun Zi's articles will quickly remember this book as nothing more than a humorous experience.This book may have been better off, though less interesting and laughable, without references or demostrations of name-callings to Sun Zi since there is the author's view of how things should be done. Consider this book only if you have much spare time."
1,Sorry ... the hype much better than the fact ....,"The author was right ..... writing this book gives him the opportunity to poke fun at and rant and rave at old actual and perceived wrongs perpetrated on him through his lifetime.First of all, the book is pushed as light reading and thought provoking ... well for sure it's light reading, but the only thought that it provoked in me was why would anyone wnat to buy this book.The book is divided up into nine parts and each part has a several chapters with specific anecdotal stories by the author and how Sun Tzu's philosophising would tie into real life today. As well the book is sprinkled with numerous pie charts and 3D graphs ostensibly to support the authors view of the world ..... These graphs and tables I found were the most aggravating, I felt they talked down to me and most are not only outright silly but meaningless .....It's not light reading I would rate it as struggle reading ....."
5,A True Classic,"This book contains a very interesting story and adventure of a West African Hunter in a dreadful forest, who eventually found the secret of lasting happiness and peace of mind. The author is Daniel Fagunwa. Wole Soyinka, a Nobelist translated the story. This book had 140 pages of jam-packed action.The reader is easily swept away by many adventure of the heroic hunter in this book. The story is captivating, and emotion-ladden, and by the time the reader hit page 20, you wont feel like dropping the book until you finish reading it.Although it contains some archaic thoughts about superstition and magic, it is a really good adventerous book I've read."
1,Really bad.,"This show is really bad. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It has not a single ounce of grit, the storyline is all-to-typical and the way the cops do things isn't ANYTHING like the way real cops do things."
1,Terrible,"These pants didn't even last through one day. I ordered two, both pilled badly, and one got a hole in it. Do not waste your money on these pants."
3,White fleece sweat pants,"Was as expected in terms of quality, except large size isn't necessarily larger in the body, just longer, a lot longer. Unable to use for this reason."
2,quality not very good,Think of the cheapest fleece pants you've seen in the store and that's the quality of these pants. I was disappointed. I would not leave the house in them.
3,Wasn't what I was looking for,I got this book to see behind the cloister walls....and this book was just strange. It didn't make much sense. Not true to the title. Not worth it. Read Story of a Soul and you will find out what it's like.
4,Works Fine for Me!,"Helped me get the job done, had no problems with it! It does what it is supposed to so no complaining there."
2,Not a very useful book,"This book has used a tricky title to tempt you. Unfortunately, you won't learn UML with it, and even less how to use UML in an iterative development process. I would recommend instead the combination of ""UML Distilled"" and ""Applying UML and Patterns"". The use of Visual C++ here has no transcendence, and from my point of view, it is just a way to attract Visual C++ developers (they are many!) that want to learn UML and software development processes. In few words: you always can learn something from any book, but this one is not a good source of knowledge. Think twice before purchasing it."
1,Did Wendy Holden really write this?,"I'm a huge Wendy Holden fan. If you are a new reader, don't give up hope, her other books send you on a rollercoaster of emotions, with unique characters you will not forget.But as for Azure Like It, all I can say is NO!!!!"
1,Couldn't pick it up,"Normally I'm the first one to buy a Wendy Holden book, and usually I can't put the book down. In this case, I just couldn't pick it up. After having read 4 fantastic books in a row, I was saving the best for last. Imagine my disappointment when I couldn't even get past the first chapter without yawning, and several months later, after re-reading that first chapter on subsequent attempts, am yet to get through to chapter two.I'm sorry to say that if a book can't grip you in the first few pages, or at least chapter one, it's pretty difficult to motivate onself to continue. I just hope your next book is a saving grace, as I'm still an ardent fan and will always cherish the past glee your books have provided. I look forward to the next one..."
5,Excelente,"Excelente creo que no hay que hablar mucho de ello, su capacidad lo dice todo.......Comprenla son problema simpre llenara sus requisitos...."
1,Memory card failed,"I purchased a SanDisk Ultra II 2 GB Memory Stick PRO Duo, for my Sony camera. After using it a couple of times with no problem, I was in the middle of a shooting session when suddenly a flashing warning appeared on my LCD screen reading "" format error"". Several attempts at reformatting the card either in the camera or in the card reader have proven unsuccessful.I was unable to retrieve the images on the stick."
2,Works Fine But No Case Provided,I was dismayed to discover that Sandisk doesn't include a plastic case for the stick! I've bought several Sandisk 512 MB Memory Stick Pro sticks (not Ultra) and they all came with cases. Even a lowly 128 MB Memory Stick (not Pro) stick came with a plastic sleeve to protect the stick. I don't know if you can even buy just the plastic cases by themselves. I'm not happy about this.
2,Home Stand,Very bad quality music stand.It s good for home practice where you don't have constantly fold and adjust the height of it.pretty bad metal piece seems it's gonna brake anytime soon.
4,Mom of 4,"great. can't believe there is a product that is without any major problem. It is solid, easy to fold (if done correctly) and compact. We usually keep it set up. I do recommend product."
5,music stand,it was just what I wanted thanks we don't use it all the time so its easy to just fold and put away
4,Cut it down in size,My purpose in purchasing this stand was to place a sheet of paper on it so I can glance down and read from it but project my voice to the back of the large hall because I am looking pretty much forward and not down. It works swell for this purpose.
3,Maria Holic,i started watching this series its not bad just wondering if the creaters are thinking of a english dub verison of this. well they may have to found two people to play Mariya.
4,"Decent, but some songs weren't great","Overall, the songs in Godzilla were pretty cool, but some of them dragged a little. However, despite those few songs, this album was still a good one. Green Day's remix wasn't all that thrilling, though. Still, I'd recommend it to all you out there."
4,I thought it was a fairly good cd! Baby,I love the WALLFLOWERS and there new song WE COULD BE HEROS. The song at the end is not on the cd thet made me mad as h**l D***t!
1,Puff Turned Kashmir into Trashmir,"Godzilla movies is bad so does its soundtrack.. It contains Come With Me by one of the most non creative rap artist, Puff Daddy. Well, he always uses music riffs from the old hits, remixes it, and calls it his own songs. If he can't write his own riff, he can't be creative rap artist. I don't know why Jimmy Page allowed Puff Daddy to make Kashmir from timeeless classics into a Trash(mir)"
5,Makes up for the movie.,"Well, Godzilla was not the best movie I have ever seen. It was worth most of the money, though. However, this CD excells, and is worth every penny. Puff Daddy&Jimmy Page's song, Come with me, is great. Hitting a high note especially if you listen to it while angry. Deeper Underground is the best song on the CD (hip hop meets alternative) All the other songs are just as good, with the exception of Fuzzbubble's song, only mediocre at best. David Arnold's score is exquisite, hitting all the right notes, and adding the perfect atmosphere to the movie. Now if only they included more of his music...But it was a stellar follow-up to his great Tommorow Never Dies soundtrack. All in all a great CD. It certainly was worth the twenty dollars. Go buy it."
2,"If not for two songs, I would give this a miss.","If not for ""Heroes"" and ""Come with me"" I wouldn't have spent money on this album. Not a very good album, I expected more when I bought it. Kind of Lame. Buy it if you have lots of money, otherwise give it a miss."
3,OK,"This CD is OK. THere are a few good songs, like heroes and brain stew. I especially like the Foo Fighters song though, A320. Come with Me is just a sad remix of Zep's Kashmir. Bonham must be rolling in his grave."
2,Green Day and Puffy,Those two are the only reason to listen to this CD. Fairly large waste of time and money.
2,Umm...I wonder why I bought this CD?,"The first song I heard was from Puff Daddy, Come with me. It's Okay, but not worth buying the CD. Then I heard Deeper Underground, and I absolutly loved it.So, I wanted to buy a Jamoriquai CD, but they didn't have it... That made me mad, so I bought Godzilla. Now I can see, that that was a waste of money, I should of waited for Jamoriquai. These songs really aren't worth the money..."
4,COOL SOUNDTRACK,"I really like godzilla the album. it's better than the movie. the track there are the best recorded by artist like Puff Daddy, jamiroquai ,wallflowers greenday and many more. the most cool track: come to me by puff daddy and jimmy page. rap and rock + orchestra music= a cool godzilla track. since i'm a great fan of some of these artist, i recommend everyone to buy this album"
4,This CD rocks!,"I bought this CD only for the second track, ""Come With Me"" by Puff Daddy and Jimmy Page; however, I discovered that this the whole CD is good. Some of the tracks take a little getting used to, but once you listen to them a couple of times, they really grow on you. I particularly enjoyed tracks 2, 5, 9, & 13."
1,Pathetic conclusion to a great series,"This book was so bad that it forced me to do something I NEVER do. When I finished it, I threw it away. It was that bad.Characters appear almost randomly. Some appear to have absolutely no importance in the storyline. Some characters disappear, and their fates are never revealed. And ""The Regiment's Last Stand"" mentioned on the cover quite simply does not occur. In fact, combat is pretty scarce throughout this entire book, considering it's title. Avoid this book, especially if you're a fan of the Regiment."
4,Great bounce N' Go,"It's a little difficult assembling, but other than that, this bike is great! My 2 year old son loves riding it even though he can't step the pedal yet, but there's a handle attached in the back to push the bike. Just like stroller."
5,Fun toy,"It is a fun toy. Easy to put together - even though they say you need 2 people - I did it by myself for my granddaughter with no problem at all. Hers is set as just the pedal model, not the bounce. She loves the sounds it makes, and she likes that there is room on the back for her cousin to ride along with her!"
1,sigh,"Bands like SOTY are pretty much everything thats wrong with music right now. Not that theres ever anything right with 99% of mainstream music to begin with, I just can't help but wonder when people are going to start making decisions for themselves and stop automatically accepting whats on the radio and TV as a basis for what's ""good music."" It disgusts me on just about every level. Start listening to independent music and looking towards your local music scene and listen to something with originality. This is garbage."
3,alright,"yea, i listen to alot of music ranging from the beatles,led zep to metallica,inflames, silverstein and saosin. i loved soty's first album. Throwing all comparisons aside...this album is alright... Listening through the tracks i really didnt find anything catchy, it sounded more like a oh crud we need to make another album so lets throw some stuff down real quick. The first album was heart felt and u can tell they put some thought into the songs. this album is the opposite. but like other people said, dont expect page avenue becuase this album is more of an in your face hear me out type cd. I would very much like to see them live cause it would be fun to mosh around to."
4,Ricki Martin Rocks the boat!,Ricki's the cutest!!! His music brings out the true being in Parents of America. My mom rocks to his beat and watches his music vids... ~ashley~
1,It was so bad and terrible.,"Hi I am Maria from Paris , France. It was a terrible Cd. I think it is terribly bad ."
4,Pyrates Cove,It is a fun addition to the rest of our collection.The box is nice for storage.Some of the pieces could fit tighter together
2,Good design; poor performance. Very disappointing.,"This model is a nice little pepper mill: relatively easy to fill, easy to use, and reasonably priced. Unfortunately, performance leaves a lot to be desired. Turn the handle one direction and the pepper is very coarse; I would described it as cracked rather than ground. Turn the handle the other direction and it grinds so fine that nothing comes out. Perhaps if the mechanism were adjusted it would work; unfortunately I can't figure out what that adjustment would be. Based on other reviews, I'm guessing my experience is a quality control issue. If it worked I would be happy. As it is, I'm purchasing yet another pepper mill."
1,Hype/False review,"I bought this product after reading the good review. The product sucks like other pepper mills I have. The fine/course adjustment doesn't work well at all. When you turn it to grind it very fine, it doesn't grind at all. I guess the company just pay people to write a good review to promote their product. Don't buy this one if you need a good grinder. Now, I have to look for a new one. :("
3,Cute but nothing new,"I enjoyed having all of Philip Marlowe's quotes in one place, but felt the item was over-priced for the amount of content, even at a used price. Probably would not purchase again. The quotes were mostly ones I could find online easily for free."
2,Very Disappointed,I have all of the Midsomers and this is by far the worst. The KING'S CRYSTAL episode is particularly bad. The ending made no sense with no plausible evidence to convict anyone. Not up to previous standards at all.
3,Not sure about this one?,"Contrary to the stellar revues, I would have to say that this book is a good overview of Flash MX. However, it doesn't in my estimation cover anything in enough depth to really give you an understanding of the underlying concepts especially when it pertains to the scripting. I am an intermediate to intermediate plus Flash User and this is definitely not the first book I turn to for answers when I need some guidance. Sorry Kids!!~"
1,User UNfriendly,Congratulations!You've made learning Flash about as difficult and tedious as possible. This book is hard to read and hard to follow.PS: 10 color pages in a book about Flash is a little ironic isn't it?
3,So-so,"This alarm clock is great on making you wake up every morning. There are three different settings: low, mid and loud. The loud setting is super loud, it can blow your head off. I usually set it on the mid setting and that's already loud enough for me.The only defective thing about this product is: they can't keep time accurately, you need to readjust the minute setting everyday since it will be 1 minute faster each day and the alarm will go off 10 minutes earlier than it supposed to be, so when you are setting your alarm, adjust the timer 10 minutes later than the time that you are supposed to wake up."
3,It's what I needed.,"I cannot hear any of the timers I""ve have bought over the years. I have no problem hearing this one. There are two things that I would like to change.You can't disable the 5 and 10 minute warning alarms. I hardly ever need that for cooking. And, it takes two hands to shut it off. That's a pain."
4,The Science of understanding Robert Fripp,"Overall I felt the book was fair in most conclusions regarding Fripp's career choices, musical directions, and mastery of his instrument. There seemed to be a few conflicts regarding his position as a fan or an author of a subject. The most disappointing slections were those that included the authors lack of appreciation for Adrian Belew's contributions to Fripp's more recent work and Belew's amazing diverse talents. Belew is more responsible for resurrecting Crimson and their fresh sound than anyone else. All serious Fripp fans should read this book. Next subject Mr. Tamm try an objective biography of Adrian Belew!"
1,"Good writers, bad writing.","I am 26 years old. But Amazon have no choice to choose from when I made a reveiw. I cannot stay along by not give any comment about this book. I am a graduate student who is very fond of leading. But I really think that Value Quest publised by CAM-I is such a bad book on earth that I've ever read. Please review the following reasons. 1. Bad writing technique. Just talky. There is no emphasis area. 2. Full of technical stuffs and hard to understand sentences. 3. Absolutely bad presentation. Small picture. The detail in each picture cannot show the clear consequence. 4.Built-up model which is very simple, but write the explanation that make readers confuse.As I saw from the writers' name, I think most of them have practical experiences in the business. I do not understand why they wrote this book to be a sleeping pill."
4,A SF bargain,"I picked this up at a used bookstore for less than the price of a Big Mac, and I am glad I did. The title story (or ""short novel"") by Christopher Grimm is above average, as is ""The City of Force"" by Daniel F. Galouye. Also includes one piece each by SF heavyweights Clifford Simak (""How-2"") and Fred Pohl (""Whatever Counts."")"
3,I guess I went a bit old when I picked the 2008,"Its ok but the 2009 is terrific. The quality of the CD itself is fine, just a little outdated music"
5,lessons for everyday writers!,"Rebeccasreads highly recommends WRITE IT RIGHT as one of the cheapest ways to groom your own writing, & worth every penny. You'll be referring to it often, if you want to learn how to cut the blubber & errors from your words & polish them until they're lean, clean & shining!The Dedication is the kernel of all these two writers have to teach. Read it & cringe, & then start the Introduction.In 5 simple steps, WRITE IT RIGHT, with contextual references to preparing for a relay race, takes you from Knowing Your Problems to A Picture Perfect Finish, including FAQ."
1,Amazon does not really carry this item,"I agree with the reviewer below who asserts that this item is always on back-order. After waiting for this item for several weeks already, I was today told by Amazon that there would be an additional one-month delay. I have canceled my order and ordered these videos directly from Infantastic."
2,Lacks Depth,"This is not classic Firesign. I don't know if they're trying too hard or not trying at all, but it seems to be all surface and nothing underneath."
5,The *REAL* Billville,"There really is a Billville. It's in Indiana, at the intersections of highway 59 and state roads 5 & 6."
1,disappointment,"This book is full of every negative generality about those born from 1961-1984. The evidence in this book supporting the ""nomad"" theory is flimsy at best. It was also written way too long ago (early 90s) to possibly explain the attitudes of Generation X, which now includes more people than the boomer generation.There is also a lot of recycled material from the book Generations. A waste of time and money, this book is fit for the trash heap."
3,Half of the picture,"Like a lot of books about ""GenX"" or ""13ers"" or what have you, Howe and others present really only half of the picture when it comes to this age group. Looking at the reviews it is easy to see this schism between people who think it is dead on and those who think it's worthless. From my own informal research, the book seems to resonate more with people born towards the begining of the demogaphic group and with Boomers. The latter half of the ""Xer"" wave is much more optimistic, social and able to work with people both younger and older than themselves. Being myself born at the tail end, I identify not at all with the picture presented here and in ""Generations"" (Strauss & Howe). I suggest that we are much less homogenous according to birthdate than these people would have you believe."
2,"Ghost Town review, Dec 2008","Has some interesting hisory points but is not the best film or story or acting. We know the area and find that makes the CD worthwhile to see - to gain knowledge of North Caroina and some of its actual people (descendants alive today). Maggie Valley, NC"
2,Spring Fever,"""Spring Fever"" is a very daring attempt at depicting sensitive issues but lack strong storyline. Praise to the actors who had to shed their inhibitions in order to make the scenes look that much more realistic."
1,Beware of Belt Loop,The belt loop failed after only three months use. Luckly I caught the case before it hit the ground.
1,Whisk works just as well,"I received the Smoothie Jr. as a gift and was so excited. After unpacking the machine I realized I was missing the stir stick. Back to Basics was wonderful!!! They sent one to me free of charge. I was ready to make great milkshakes and smoothies. My first attempt flopped. I tried a simple milkshake, but it would not mix up, let alone dispense from the dispenser. I kept adding milk to make it thinner, but it never would work.I thought, maybe it's my fault, let's try again. I tried using a banana, strawberry yogurt, orange marmalade, 1/2 cup crushed ice and used over a cup of milk. The machine wouldn't even chop the banana, let alone finish off the ice. I am very frustrated with the machine, and hate to tell the person who gave it to me.Good Luck with yours should you decide to purchase. You may want to try the Elite, it could be stronger."
2,The spout isn't worth it,"This is a sub-par blender with a spout. None of the parts are dishwasher safe. The lid vibrates loose even from its lock-in position running on low, and it's very difficult to get off because there's nothing to grab. The only mistake I made bigger than buying this thing is throwing the box and receipt away immediately. Get a good blender and put up with all the lifting and pouring."
5,One of the best Django CDs in a crowded field.,"The Reinhardt/Grappelli discography is currently overcrowded with product both good and slipshod, and someone just wanting an introduction to their marvelous music could easily get confused. Make no mistake, the vast majority of these 25 performances (clocking at a generous 74:15 running time) are taken from THE classic ""Hot Club de France"" quintet performances from the 1930s, and represent much of the very best work these two masterful musicians ever did together.For those not familiar with ASV's ""Living Era"" series, these are beautifully and unobtrusively remastered old recordings -- a virtual sonic textbook on how to remaster the old stuff right. The price is nothing to complain about, either.If you're looking for one Reinhardt/Grappelli CD, this is the one to have."
5,NICE Pen!,The Cross Century II pen is certainly a Cross. I have a new appreciation for Cross pens after using this one. It's a bit heavier and a bit thicker than the traditional pens. I am enjoying it very much.
4,Good read but cut Bush some slack,"Hey it's a decent book, not an out right Bush bash like I thought it would be. Good points are made; valid critisms are not over played. My problem is not with the book, but what people make it to be: an attack on Bush. Yeah after reading this book you will be left with the sense that Bush Jr. is not the brightest light in the sky. Hey so what, we knew that already. He's a decent guy, and we could be way worse off. If it wasn't for 9-11 he would have been a good President. He just got in over his head. Back off and let the man do his job. It's looking like he's not gonna get a second term, so give him some peace for the rest of it."
3,Paul O Neil's Story,A revealing look into the Bush White House. Sometimes it is shocking at how politics seems to be driving decision making in the Bush White House. Ron Suskind has written a biography of O Neals time in the White House. He draws heavily on ONeals material and opinion. I felt this was the both weak point and strong point of the book. Weak point because this was basically one mans version of the white house policy making. For example there is a lot of information on the environmental policy but no opinion of anyone in the EPA or Ms. Whitman. Strong point because this is the view of one of the most influential people in the White house.However I feel this book does offer an important look into the current white house policy making that one should be aware of especially with the elections due soon
3,more revealing than perhaps it realises,"One of the bizarre outcomes of a Republican allowing a liberal ideologue like Suskind to write his kiss and tell is that it makes Paul O'Neill - the Big O, as Bush called him - seem something of a flaky idiot. Literally every second chapter he is flying off to Africa with Bono. Is trying to solve Ghana's water problem in the job description of Treasury Secretary of the United States, a job founded by Alexander Hamilton? This kind of outside-the-box enthusiasm may have worked at Alcoa, but it doesn't suit one of the highest offices in the land, and (if true) is cause enough for Cheney to have fired him, notwithstanding his non-cooperation with most of the administration on most economic issues, especially tax cuts.That said, still worth reading, particularly for its stuff on Iraq policy."
3,The Price of Loyalty,"The Price of Layalty by Ron Suskind, for me was a little long on accounting arguments and to short on relationship details. the difficulty of working with George W. Bush, an out of touch person with no sence of the reality or commpassion for the common man and what he is going through, is in their some where, I think. You just have to look really hard for it. Also, it is apparent that Ideology was far more important to the president than listening to the smartest people in our nation about what would be best for the good of people. But then again you had to wade through the mundane to get that. On the other hand I give it a little higher marks because it at least revealed what a stupid Idiot We have had as president of eight years."
1,349 pages to tell us nothing,"I actually read this book. It is vapid. Few details as to what was wrong w/ Bush jr. administration. Bush is described as being inattentive, not interested nor savvy on the details of macro economics nor foreign policy. But there is no subsequent critique of Bush's intellect; nothing to tell us whether Bush is actually ignorant or a savant. I understand O'neill might not saay ""Bush was a dope"" but he could have said he was an empty suit who rode into the WH in his dad's station wagon. Too many mundane entries like ""so and so poured himself a cup of coffee or wine and looked out the window."" Who cares? With O'Neill's corporate background and intellect he could've tossed in some charts and statistics that would have made his cases for economic policies that were ignored by Bush who could not grasp such ideas. If you are gonna write a tell-all book then tell us something!"
3,What is the price of loyalty?,"According to this book, the price of loyalty is mutual agreement on major points based on mutual confirmation of facts. But what if that which you are trying to achieve has never been done before? What if there are incomplete facts to base your decisions on? What if there are problems that need to be solved now, such as high taxes and a potential disaster in the making from Iraq? Leaders make decisions based on incomplete information, realizing that their decisions will lead to other problems to be dealt with later. Loyalty is based on believing in the direction being taken by the leaders in dealing with these problems. O'Neill could not in good conscience work for Bush because he personally differed in his opinion of how these problems were dealt with, and his differing personal style from Bush. However he does not have any meaningful alternative solutions and this book comes off as sniping, rather than analysis, which he so ardently praises time and again."
4,A blind man among deaf people? How true!,"Considering how the economy has fallen down into the toilet and how this President fails to listen to anybody, I agree that he is like a blind man among deaf people.Price of Loyalty by Paul O'Niel is very revealing and a must read for anyone who truely loves this country. Remember, O'Niel was an insider who personally witnessed many things that this adminstration would love to keep quiet."
2,Will the real writer please stand up,Before finishing this book I heard O'Neil say it was really his co-writer (the writer who approached him about writing it) who wrote it and read the financial documents and papers. He said it wasn't even really his book. I was shocked at how he could say one thing in one interview and then another a few days later. As far as I am concerned he and his book lost all credibility.
5,Have we lost our country to special interests?,"This is a must-read for all American citizens before we go to the polls in November. What I took away with me after reading this book is that you and I, average citizens, have no clout, no influence on the policies of the Bush Administration. Bush listens only to his base: the religious right and the corporate bosses. Policies are implemented based entirely on what the base wants and have nothing to do with thoughtful evaluation of the facts. For example, the astonishing $1.3 trillion tax cut was implemented without talking to the Treasury Dept. No input whatsoever. That's hard to imagine, but this book is filled with similar revelations. This is not one to miss."
5,O'Neil Not Smart Enough to Know A Circle Jerk When He Sees One,Great book on the ignorance of the Bush White House circle jerk and a the ignorance of a smart businessman and his failure to recognize Bush and Cheney as the King and Prince of Jerks. Really hard to believe that O'Neil could be so naive. This whole story is more likely just kayfabe and political entertainment.
4,Impressed,"I was impressed with these speakers. Mids are good and plenty loud. I don't have to turn it past 50%. The bass is OK. I can hear it just fine, and it fills in where needed. Not overwhelming.The only thing is that I thought this would have come with a separate input for the 2 speakers and the subwoofer. In other words, my mobo has outputs for a sub, but i'm not using it. Just one plug into the mains. Oh well. Who knows if that sub plug works anyway."
1,DO NOT buy it,the sounds quality is not bad.but it has random noise when there is cell phone signal around the speakers.it's very bad design since it's pc speakers.
2,GOOD SOUND.ANNOYING RF INTERFERENCE,"Sounds good for the price. However, I cannot seem to find the right position to eliminate the frequency hiss/humm/distorsion sound. I am extremely disappointed since the cabinet, sound reproduction may have a great potential if not for the interference. Since I am in Japan, FPO address, this is serious inconvenience to return, I'll just have to try and hoping this will work better in my garage when I return to US. I recommend that you try it first with your phone/cordless products prior to your purchase."
5,Awesome speakers for anything.,I love these speakers. They are very good quality for the price I paid. I listen to metal so these speakers have gone through alot of pounding but they are still like new. The bass is very deep for such a small sub and people sometimes wonder where the bass is coming from because they don't believe it can do that. Very loud and the bass is adjustable. The downside is that there is lots of interference with wireless signals coming from my phone and my router. Whenever I receive a message there's a loud noise that lasts for about a second. But oddly I find it useful because it alerts me that I'm getting a message. There is a constant noise that it receives from my wireless router that is a bunch of clicking. With a simple adjustment of the antenna I can get rid of the noise. I would definitely recommend this to everyone.
1,non compatability problems- support was kno help,I bought the 3400c in Sept 2000 and ran it on Win98. It gave a lot of error messages even though the software says it was loaded correctly. I changed to Win ME and found it was not compatable. I waited 3 months for the update from HP and finally got it. I loaded the new ME driver and never could get it to work. I went to help on line and after 3 back and forth messages the HP folks told me to contact the manufacturer - I thought they were the manufacturer. Needless to say not happy with product or support. I gave it away
3,It used to be great,"There are so few magazine publishers these days. This used to be a great magazine, but like so many other little magazines, it has been sucked up by a larger publishing house and the overall quality has suffered ever since.It is interesting to read about the absolute best products that are out there, but it would also be cool and helpful to review all classes, from low to mid to high end. The truth about electronics is that you can get a huge improvement in quality by spending more, but once you reach a certain level of quality you have to shell out even more money for just small increments of quality. So why focus on the upper mid range and high end only?"
1,Excellent publication ruined by large publishing house,Home Theater is my hobby and HTM was an excellent place to learn about the subject. They had engineers doing real tests and comparisons that had integrity. A few years ago the mag was sold to a large publisher who fired all the good people and brought in writers that should be working for Home and Garden Magazine.The reviews we could once count on are now paid for by the advertisers so you can no longer draw any conclusions from them.I am deeply saddened by the loss of my favorite publication.
1,Order Agar already mixed,"Thought I was getting petri dishes with agar already prepared. Unless you live in a sterile lab., it is very easy to contaminate the agar prior to actually submitting samples to it. Not worth it!"
5,Plain words and Simple Concepts that Actually Work,"Wow. Finally, a well-written, easy-to-understand guide to help us set up a system to lead healthier lives.Although this book will certainly be a boon for anyone looking for help with losing weight or stopping an addiction, I found the tools could also useful for a wide variety of goals (learning a language, for example).I recommend this book to anyone looking for plain words and simple concepts that actually WORK."
4,"Songs that perfectly reflect the emotion of ""Ally McBeal""","OK so not everyone likes cover songs - normally I don't but it is true that a descent cover version can bring fantastic music to a new generation. The music contained on this album does in essence bring together the soundtrack of the show extremely well, from ""Searching my soul"" (the theme tune) to song more than forty years old - the construction and variety makes this a great CD for both ""Ally McBeal"" fans and music fans in general."
2,Terrible mix. Backup overwhelms vocals.,Songs on TV show are mixed far better than CD. Best selections are Vonda with minimal accompaniment. CD was a real disappointment after hearing the same numbers on Ally McBeal.
1,Not What I expected!,"Of all the great songs on Ally thoses that were the choosen are in the bottom of what I would of picked (OK 2 or 3 were great). It appeared as if the artist, who does have a great voice, had her own agenda for the songs picked and not the public. I threw my copy in the trash can and just decided I learned my lesson when I did not take the time to learn what songs were being sang. Do not waste your money on this bad CD."
2,"backup music group was awful, ruined the album","I was very disappointed in the CD. The backup group sounded awful, tinny, and cheap. Please try again"
4,if you love Ally's show don't miss it!,Lot's of popular songs song by Vonda. Vonda's voice is impressive. I liked it. You'll too...
5,fabulous!!!!!!,JUST received the cd in the mail....it is probably one of the best I've heard in a long time!!!!!! Vonda Shepard is an extraordinary performer...the song selections are great.....SO GLAD I PICKED THIS ONE!!!
3,disappointed,"I bought these as a Christmas present. The image on-line made them look like they had glass on them. They were just painted metal and did not ""sparkle"". My grown son told me they were great but I was disappointed."
3,A little whinny,"A good thing I didn't read the reviews before purchasing this book I would have been dissapointed (a little star struck aren't we?). I found Roberts left leaning, anti-US views clouded a possible objective view on what actually happen. I didn't find anything funny in the content, war is not funny at any point. I was a bit disgusted, as a Canadian, with his antics, especially his `thievery'. His detail and prose definitely creates a page turner, I will give you that. I think he is quite lucky he isn't dead with the `US-like' cowboy reporter mentality he protrays; one day walking around saying your Canadian won't save your butt. I expected a bit more depth in his analysis and a sounder conclusion or (even a conclusion). Definitely one to read and draw your own opinion. I believe ""The Wars Against Saddam"" by John Simpson is better, enlightening choice."
3,Excellent for the price,"I chose this speedometer because it was the lowest priced one with a black face and white numbers that also fit an older Toyota Landcruiser. It was everything I expected except for: 1. the Toyota speedo cable didn't clip on, the inner cable fit but the outer lock didn't. I had to secure the outer cable to the housing with electrical tape; 2. the light bulb housings don't twist and lock, they're just held in place due to a tight fit. No problem while it's new, but after 50 times changing bulbs or bulb colors, I'll probably have to put a dab of Elmer's glue on to hold them in place; 3. (this is probably due to my setup, not the speedo) it reads 5 mph below actual speed from 0 to about 50, then it's right on from 60 to 75. If I had known this before I bought it, I still would have bought it. I'm not disappointed."
4,Couldn't put this one down!,"Terri Blackstock's book was my first read with my new Kindle and I had a hard time pulling myself away from it. While I wouldn't call it a ""coming of age"" read, it truly was like one. Deni - a spoiled rich kid with a Georgetown degree - finds herself when everything that is ""seemingly"" important to her disappears one afternoon. I'll not give the plot away but imagine what would happen if suddenly you find ""technology"" has disappeared. Cars don't run, refrigerators are empty and the only thing between you and the last bicycle is an angry mob willing to kill to get it. Couple that with a killer on the loose, a family torn between hoarding and sharing and a God who still has it all in control. You'll not be disappointed with this read!"
3,So-so,"I read the whole thing hoping it would get better, but was disappointed. Too much religion, and poorly developed plot lines. If the idea of the story is interesting to you, try Life As We Knew It by Susan Beth Pfeffer. Much better story and realistic characters."
1,Tried to read it,"I really wanted to like this book and have read Blackstock in the past. The audio is probably worse than the book itself. The man's voice is hard to listen to...esp. when he is voicing a woman...the constant whining by the children got on my nerves SO bad, I had to abandon it. Then you throw in a whole strange murder etc. and this book is too weird for me...one flub they made was when the flashlights worked...how is it possible when watches, cars, and all other batteries are dead? Good luck to others who may want to explore this series."
2,trying too hard,"The book catches quickly and you keep reading. The issue is that there are long, long long sermons in the book. I found myself skimming through them to get back to the main plot of the book. There is a good story behind it, but all the fundamental christian preach seems too strong for my taste, and characterizes every non-christian or any person that touches alcohol as ""bad guys"". The problem is, you still want to find out how it all ends - so you're stuck with the book in spite of the constant biblical references. If you're not up for that, then I suggest to not even start reading."
5,His Best!,"Rory was always one of my favorite guitar players, I think this was his best work. It captured the energy of his live performances. He plays Electric, Acoustic, Harmonica, and Mandolin on this CD."
2,people can't hear me,"I work in a large enterprise that makes extensive use of plantronics headsets. While many of the higher-grade headsets work great, this headset is notorious for not picking up people's voices. It is impossible to get the boom microphone well positioned for some people (big heads?).I am buying something else!"
1,Format problems,"Beware - while this will play on a DVD video player, it will not play on a DVD audio player. Labeling this an ""extended audio disc"" is rather misleading for the general public."
2,Stroller barely reclines,"This stroller is a great concept, for short outings. The only problem is the front seat reclines very little, there are only 2 positions. My 10 month old falls asleep, and his head rolls down into his shoulder, wakes up and ends up taking a very short nap. I still need a full size, comfy, fully reclining stroller. I should have bought one high end stroller instead of now 2 mid priced ones."
3,Go Simpsonic With the Simpsons,"More music from the television show. Basically, this is for completists (myself included) only. It provides no insight into the music or special arragements, merely just the songs like you'd record them off a TV (albiet with better sound). Still, with 53 tracks of classic funny songs, this'll still entertain on those long car journeys."
5,Thank heavens for St. Rhino!,"Rhino Records to the rescue...proving yet again that they are the hippest group of music lovers on the planet! After the dissapointing ""Yellow Album"" I called for this follow up to ""Songs In The Key Of Springfield"" and, Voila! ""Go Simpsonic With The Simpsons"" comes along. It is every bit as good as ""Songs"". The standout this go round is the brilliant ""Sherry Bobbins"" parody of ""Mary Poppins"", with all songs complete and intact, even the closing montage! The only problem I have with ""Simpsonic"" and ""Songs In The Key..."" is, which one to play. Sweet, sweet Rhino...please do a ""Vol.3""...and ""4""...and ""5""...and..."
5,Simply a hoot,Even after years of watching the Simpsons I never really appreciate how much the music has added to this enduring series.These CDs are loaded with funny moments and some really great music.. I use them as .Wav files to attach to Email. People really get a kick out of them..
5,I'm blown away by the awesome songs!,S.O.A.P. is now my favorite album. Heidi and Line are fantastic singers. I can't wait for more songs to come out!!!!!!!
1,too small,had no idea these were little tiny books- too much of a hassle to return - and just too small! goo books -bad size
1,MISREPRESENTED!,If I could have given this NO stars I would.I purchased this book because my daughter had this story as a child and loved it. It showed an interracial family which I wanted for my child care center's multicultural area. I WAS SO TICKED OFF when the book arrived and it was not a real book at all. It was this teeny tiny 2 x 2 inch cereal box prize type book. TOTALLY MISREPRESENTED! Going to the bookstore from now on where I can get my money's worth!!!!!! What a complete rip off!
2,I wish for better discriptions,"My son has be asking me for Robert Munsch book for weeks and I was so proud of myself finding all these book at great prices. Wasn't my son going to be so excited!? I was so upset that I didn't even give them to him. The 3 books I purchased were mini books, they were smaller then the size of my hand. Hello, this was a very important description that was left out. Not Happy!I'm just glad the one book he really wanted was a regular size book."
1,A dud,"One would think that ""standard advertised equipment"" could be counted on as trustworthy. Not so. Perhaps I just got a dud. I'll go to Wal-Mart and buy what I need before trusting this product again. First of all it would not fit easily into my cell phone (V180), then there was NO JUICE at all, even after several hours initial charging. Waste of money."
4,"Oh, Boy!","I bought this as a prop for a one man show, I am putting together. I have every expectation that it will make a wonderful addition and add to the fun."
3,master kim,"well worth the price of the dvd,he covers alot of techniques and fun to watch.easy to follow demonstrations that are entertaining to watch aswell as educational.i would be any of these dvd's"
5,TYKEE SAYS,"This is by far my favorite figurine purchase from Fitz and Floyd. I love it all, but this (for some reason), touches my heart."
4,"Nice looking watch, but the fit could be better","I got this watch because I'm an avid Triumph motorcycle owner. The watch looks great, and it's got a nice weight to it. My issue is with the fit of the bracelet. The trend in watches these days seems to be oversized links, which means removing one or two still leaves the watch feeling and wearing loose. Removing one more link results in the fit being too tight. There should be a couple of half links in this band. (Movado provides them with their watches, so I know it can be done). Nothing on the literature gives the identity of the actual manufacturerHowever, that issue aside, the watch looks and runs great. If you're into Triumph motorcycles, get the watch to go with your bike."
4,Great Game for Kids,I bought this game for my 5 year old and she thinks it is great. Even my little 2 year old can play it with a little help.
1,Had to send back,"Bought ths for my boyfriend for Christmas, I thought the separate pocket for shoes was a fantastic idean especially because this was going to be used as a gym bag. Unfortunately when he opened it up the product was extremely cheaply made, the zipper broke upon first use. Very disappointed, the only good thing is that when I contacted the seller they sent a refund right away and told me not even to send the bag back and just donate it to good will."
1,Strong Toxic Chemical Smell,"I ordered this bag over another because of the water bottle holder, zipper pouch and shoe/wet bag area. Big mistake. The minute I opened the package I was overwhelmed by the plastic chemical smell. I put it across the room so my son would not be exposed to the fumes and after a while I could smell it across the next room and it was giving me a headache. I figured that it probably just needed to be aired out, but after a week the smell is still just too strong. I tried to send this back but you must pay for your own shipping (both ways) and it would've cost me more to send it back (around 10 in shipping and another 14 to send it back) than would have been worth the bag. A serious waste of a lot of money. I really regret this purchase."
2,"Too expensive for its ""quality""",I just received the Nikon DR-6 right angle viewfinder for $190. This item is overpriced. It has a zooming mechanism that requires refocusing. One should be able to fine focus at 2x and then recompose at 1x without the need to refocus this unit.
2,Beware palm users who telecommute,"ACT does not support using your palm to synch between two computers. I work at home half the time and at the office half the time, and have always used one palm to synch to both machines. If you do this with ACT, you end up with 4 different copies of each record. You can synch database to database at two different locations, but it entails using a zip drive (floppy is too small) to carry the updates from computer to computer. Not very convenient.Theoretically a great product, but I can't really use it."
3,Starting to rust alreadyAfte,"After reading the other reviews I thought I had finally found a strainer that would last a while. It DOES hold water well in the sink, but it is already rusting at the base and I've only had it a short while. I will continue to search for one that won't start to rust so quickly but will still keep the water in the sink. I may resort to all plastic."
2,Did not work for me,"This product did not work for me. I needed a strainer that you can adjust vertically since my sink drain is deeper than the strainer would go. If it were adjustable, it would have been perfect."
2,A Brain Teaser,A simplistic presentation that presents some powerful ideas. A useful tool for Masonic leaders and teachers. Definitely not aimed at the general public.
3,In Harmony is better,"I got this CD for my grandson. I was disappointed when I heard it. It was nice but surprisingly bland. In Harmony, while older, is a much better children's ""album."""
2,over rated cd,"I would not consider playing this cd for the baby because certain songs are too noisy and the bass is too heavy (e.g., the itsy bitsy spider). Don't buy it just because you like your favorite artist. I like the Martha Stewart baby: sleepytime and the golden slumbers: a father's lullaby."
3,Disappointing Compared With Vol. Too,Was really excited to get this after loving For Our Children Too -- but was disappointed in the songs and performances. Love Bob Dylan but the rest are just ok.
3,"Good content, if you're patient and willing to sift for it","While the book's attempt at humor irritates me, I still manage to find good information. The author covers a lot of material. Some of it is way too simplistic. Some of it is not deep enough in my opinion. I've picked it up a few times and put it back down, but won't toss it. That being said, I'm still looking for seomthing better (SAP Press doesn't have anything actually good either, despite some new titles)."
1,No Thanks!,"I think one would get far more uplifting if they bought ""Gates of Hell"" by Venom or ""South of Heaven"" by Slayer - after all, they're just pranksters like the good ol' Benny Hinn!"
2,Poorly done American Translation,"Maybe we red white and blue citizens of the U.S. are spoiled but this recent translation of the hit spanish book leaves a lot to be desired. I was red in the face when I saw so many spelling errors, and photos posted with erroneous descriptions. I was blue that I had wasted money on this book. And finally it would have been better off if they had left the pages blank white."
1,Doesn't work - unlike Beano,"I bought two bottles of this product several months ago here on Amazon. That was a total waste of money.After using this product, taking two or three capsules every time I eat a high fiber (beans) meal or a fatty meal (beef), I have had no relief from gas and/or bloating.Overall, I'm very dissatisfied with the product and wonder if others aren't receiving a placebo effect.This Jarro-Zymes Plus product does NOT work, whereas Beano actually DOES work every time when eating a high fiber meal. You get what you pay for."
3,Jumps around too much,"If you have the time to study, I mean REALLY study, and time to do the examples from start to finish (I don't), and want to know how COM works under the hood, this is probably a good book. However, sorry, but I could care less about HOW things work under the hood, I just want them to work so I can concentrate on my application. It also jumps around too much, important things you really need to know to make ATL COM objects are scattered throughtout the book (thank goodness it has a good index)."
3,Distracting Vocals,"This was my first Paul Hardcastle CD and I was disappointed with it primarily because of the 3 tracks where his daughter sings. I found the music on the CD to be very enjoyable overall but I thought the 3 vocal tracks were a distraction. I am sure that Hardcastle's daughter is a very sweet and kind girl but I did not find her singing to be a attribute.I still can't understand why some excellent smooth jazz artists, like Hardcastle, seem to think that adding 'unknown' voices necessarily improve the quality of there CD offerings. As a consumer, if I want to hear voice there are any number of recognized quality singers with their own CDs that I have the option to putchase."
1,"Yet Another ""DUD""","A fine example of what Smooth Jazz is. Far too many Electronic Musical subsitutions, in place of true Musical instruments. Echo chambers, are another failure. Creates a haunting sound but that is about all. Where is the rhythm? Missing in action. True musical instruments, and maybe single mic recording would be a vast improvement. Oh yes and some improvisation. I hope K.BRENT OF ORANGE COUNTY, CA, takes note. This INDIVIDUAL obviously has never heard real Jazz."
2,Sherlock Need Not Worry -- Rivals are paper tigers,"Unfortunately the rivals of Sherlock Holmes are not nearly as interesting as Sherlock Holmes and Dr Holmes. They simply do not resonant. The dialogue is stilted as well as the acting. The plots are predictable which is very unfortunate in a ""mystery"" that is not a mystery. An hour after viewing an episode it was difficult to remember what it was about. That is not what I wanted."
2,It's OK,"This album is ok, a whole lot better, perhaps, than many of it's contemporaries. But I'll be honest, I really don't like grunge. Where this guy really benefits is from his Bob Dylan influenced lyrics. But somehow Dylan and grunge seem a bad combination to me. There are tracks that sound like Dylan ballads but are topped off with loud, rumbling rhtyhm guitar. I suppose he's a risk taker.That said, I just can't help feeling that the potential is only realised in a few tracks, like the sentimental 'One more dance' or the poetic, beautiful 'Get out' and 'Ride'. I think the CD gets better as it goes along. A couple of the songs venture into Blink-182 territory, which isn't really rewarding, especially in the face of the great tracks I just mentioned."
4,Secret letters,Reading this was interesting. Trying to read between the lines was easy in some and hard in others. I would recommend this to people who enjoy gossipy type books.
4,Surprisingly Interesting,"The letters are simple but then so was Marilyn (apparently). She just wanted to be loved and who better to love her than JFK. However, the book was surprisingly entertaining and I got lost in the to-ing and fro-ing between Marilyn and Jacqui, almost forgetting that it was fiction. This was probably because the letters were well researched and the historical prospective was authentic. I enjoyed the journey."
5,Great premis,Very interesting read. The author presented a wonderful premis and executed it very well. I truly believe that she captured the essence of each of these women. I have already recommended this to several of my friends
3,Quick & Interesting Read,"Just when you think you have read everything out there on MM, you find this intriguing little book. The author does a commendable job in setting up a believable premise: Jackie and MM would have liked each other and corresponded. Though I did have trouble suspending my disbelief that it would have continued after the author had J suspecting something was afoot under the covers. But hey, this is fiction, I reminded myself. The author does list sources for her fictional conclusions in the footnotes which adds an aura of truth to the story. My two complaints with this book and why I didn't give it 4 stars are: first the ebook was fraught with punctuation typos. Second, the story stopped abruptly with MM's death. Very little said, very little felt. Too bad."
3,Not believable,I hate that this is in my brain now. Supposed to be fiction? Just more smut added to situation in history already clouded with smut! Give me something real...even if it is nasty!
2,The Secret Letters of Marilyn Monroe to Jaqueline Kennedy,"I found this book slow paced and a little boring, it did not leave me anxious to turn the page. I am interested in the characters but disappointed in the dialogue!"
1,stupid idea for a book,"why would anyone want to read a fictional book on MM and Jackie O??? especially when there are real, non-fiction books out there. they never wrote 1 letter to each other! i think ms. leigh is desperately trying to make $/cash in (both of these women are legends, so both of them is guaranteed extra $), so she decided to write this; stoop so low to make up a correspondonce between the two women. i'm not getting down on ms.leigh personally, i'm sure she's probably a good writer, great storyteller, and very intelligent. but the idea of this book seems pathetic. maybe it's me, but i just don't get it. i guess it's only for people who like fiction and made up stories to pass the time. i like the real stuff. i would never buy this book."
3,Blah Mals,"Jan Kaldenbach's paperback book on the Belgian Malinois was anything but on the breed. The book is meant for someone interested in having an introduction to the sport of French Ring and would want to know how to go about training. However, even that information is limited. Kaldenbach has a touch and go feel to the book about the Malinois. Which means that very little information is given about the breed. The book hardly has any pictures of Malinois, and only one picture of a nice looking Malinois. Kaldenbach took an exciting, versitile dog and made the breed Ho-Hum. by lack of vital information. Not a good book for anyone wanting to learn about the breed itself or to check out what the breed is meant to look like. All through, Kaldenbach barely touches on his subject in order to cover a lot of information in a small space. However, by doing so the reader does not get to learn very much about the breed or its potential."

5,A great showcase for one of Latin music's best voices,"""Pensando en ti"" is a great CD by Leo Vanelli. All the songs are in Spanish. Leo's voice is one of the best in all of the Latin music world: he has a superb blend of sweetness and sheer power, and he performs each song with tremendous skill and passion. And his pronunciation of Spanish is a joy to hear; he seems to really be making love to the language. The horns, percussion, and Latin rhythms that accompany Leo blend perfectly with this great voice.The CD starts off strong with Leo's soaring performance on ""Te vas."" He is particularly tender and romantic on ""Vivo pensando en ti"" and ""Me estoy enamorando."" Leo is clearly having fun on ""No hay cama pa' tanta gente,"" on which he goes really crazy, even crowing like a rooster. The CD ends with ""Para darte me vida,"" a stunningly beautiful song with which Leo performs real Latin magic. If you love Latin music, don't miss this CD by a truly outstanding talent."
4,Great business philosophy book with minor quirks,"This audiobook is very good. Paul Orfalea, the founder of Kinko's, became a businessman before he even graduated college. He also has ADHD and dyslexia, two traits most people consider as weaknesses. He explains in his book not so much on technical detail, but the concepts that many businesses fail to consider.I am giving 4 stars because this is the abridged version and it is NOT read by the author. Despite those minor imperfections, this is a good book for business leaders, the ADHD people of society or the dyslexic."
1,This book is Wretched,"Once upon a time there was a girl who read a book so bad that it gave her a headache, and now she is suffering from insomnia and has no recourse but to write a review on amazon explaining the horrors of the book.Not only is the painter described in it an absolute moron with no mind for artistry or understanding of innovation, the author has a similar ham-fisted lack of eloquence and subtlety. His motifs are inserted with the grace of a brontosaurus using its tail to perform an eye exam. There are so many things wrong with this book that I kept checking the author's bio at the back, trying to see if maybe I had made a mistake and picked up one of those books by a 10-year-old amateur that some publishing companies put out for laughs.Ok, I think I've made myself clear.Bones?"
4,Very good if you use it with more PCOS books,"I found this book to be very helpful. I was diagnosed with PCOS about 4 weeks sgo, after suffering from the symptoms for 9 years. If you combine this book with another one like ""what to do when the doctor says it's PCOS"" you will understand a lot about how to eat to fight the PCOS symptoms, specially over weight. I didn't care about it being british, I understood everything anyway, so don't be afraid, this book will help."
5,A Nice Little Book,"I read this book cover to cover in one night. As a former New Yorker, it made me aware of some spots I'll be sure to try next time I'm in town. Mr. Fleischmann's style of writing is easy to read and fun at that.You have to appreciate it from the point that this is not a Zagat or Fodors. It is one writers view of on a very particular group of dining spots, especially those on the Upper West Side.A good read and a great gift for your friends in NY."
4,pretty good for what you pay for,"obviously this won't work as well as expensive salon treatment, but for the money, it is worth it. i have used it a few times and i like it. i was a little afraid after reading reviews about people claiming their hair was falling out in clumps. i have very thin, fine hair, and it didn't make my hair fall out any more than normal brushing does. it does smell kind of bad, but don't most boxed hair products? my hair isn't curly, only a little wavy... but i can tell the difference after i use this. will probably buy it again!"
3,Instant Video ToGo,"This product does produce H.264 many times faster than normal software based encoding. I would like to see a Windows Vista version of the software and drivers since all new computers run Vista. I would like to see a Mac OS X version of the software and drivers since the Mac is a primary video platform. One major problem was that I took unprotected VOBs and MPEG2 video and encoded under the InstantVideo. I transfered the video to Apple TV and the picture was unsynchronized. Lastly, the Media Converter v2 software has a later version 2.5. This version crashes under Windows XP with the InstantVideo tongle attached to the USB port."
1,No faster than without hardware acceleration,We bought an Instant Video-to-go accelerator and are extremely disappointed. Conversion on our Lenovo T60 dual-core processors is real-time only (2 hours encoding for a 2 hour video). This is the same time it takes using other software-only encoders. Attempts to inquire on the manufacturer's website result in website errors only.
1,this product burned my skin,"This product gave me blisters whenever I used it my skin ended up with water bumps and I still have spots on my legs and tummy to show, Dont waste any money on this unless you want your skin to be burned"
2,Don't like it,"I brought this to use on the days I don't go to the gym. But if your buying it just to be lazy and not really work out, don't get it. Its very small"
1,ab sonic,this product does not work and is very faulty. everytime i go to use this product it takes me an hr for it to start working but only works for 5 min. its not worth the money your better off paying 50 bucks for a real ab toner
1,ONLY FDA APPROVED EMS are sold legally in the US,"Be careful. According to the FDA.GOV site, only FDA certified electromuscular stimulation devices are sold legally in the US. They have rec'd reports of uncertified (ILLEGAL) products causing burns and other types of damage. search on EMS on the FDA site. There is only one (I won't name it so this is unbiased) belt certified at this time by the FDA, and it's NOT THIS ONE."
1,Should be named HOOVER,"This movie should be named after a vacuum cleaner, because it sure sucks like one. This movie had nothing going for it. Horrible acting, no special effects at all. Just a little fake blood thrown about. In one scene, you could see the stake go between the actors arm and body. If you want to see this movie, download it like me, and you won't be out any money, just about an 1:36 min. of your precious time, if you can even make it that long."
2,No effects yet,"Been using this for a couple of days now. i have not yet noticed any effects at all. Will keep on using for a couple more weeks and write an update if there is any noticeable impact. i think this may be one of those supplements you will have to use for months before getting any noticeable results.It is supposed to be taken on an empty stomach which is usually difficult to achieve at night. So, i usually take it first thing in the morning. By night time i certainly do not notice any difference in my seep pattern. It's not easier to fall asleep, though not harder either. Will keep on using as i said and will see how it goes."
3,Better Than Melatonin,"I believe Jarrow Formula 5-HTP is going to give people different results. Judgment is more subjective because it will be more effective for some and less for others.For me this melatonin precursor is more effective (and for me) without the side effects of melatonin itself. Although anecdotal, melatonin has sometimes been nightmarish; while this one so far seems more benign.The great objection I have is that this formula is less effective (again, for me) than other sleep aides. Diphenhydramine works better; it gets me to sleep more quickly and for a longer duration.(Before finishing this review, I consulted WebMD and Mayo.com, which I recommend as good resources to consult when thinking about using sleep aides.)"
4,calm and relaxed,I have been using this for a while now and I am having an easy time not feeling groggy in the morning. I also use Calms Forte and they seem very similar. I am not having an GI upset like some vitamins and herbs can cause so I am pretty pleased with this product.
1,"Sugar Free, Flour Free, Gluten Free, Wheat Free Triple Chocolate, Macadamia Nut Dutch Cocoa Cookies",This was not even sweet. I recommend the pumkin walnut variety which is very nice and tastes sweet enough.
5,Plant based product---No animal testing,"I like that this is a plant-based product.A lot of conditioners have tallow in them, apparently. My dermatologist told me to find a product like this one that doesn't have animal fats (like tallow) in them, which keeps oils off my face, pillow, etc. (I am pushing retirement, but still have occasional skin problems. It might be a good conditioner for anyone of any age with break-outs.)This product de-tangles my hair VERY well (shoulder length, color treated/gray/coarse), doesn't weigh down my hair like heavier conditions do, and has a nice, clean ""generic"" herbal type scent that doesn't linger after rinsing.My husband uses it, too, and his hair is thinning on top. He likes the body it gives his hair, i.e., it doesn't weigh down his hair on top like heavier conditions will.ARL (manufacturer) does not engage in animal testing."
2,New Scent is Not Welcomed,"I've been using Thicker Fuller Hair Conditioner for over 10 years and have been happy with the product. However, I've noticed that this product's scent was recently changed to having a very pungent, ""chemically-strong"" smell that is unwelcomed, certainly in the morning. Please change the scent back to the original."
5,Great Product!,"My children have been taking Immuno Raptors for a few years now and when it comes to supplements, not too many impress me but these little things really work. Not only are they for children, but my husband and I take them. We've found that not only does our family not get sick near as often but when we do, the duration is much shorter and the symptoms are not near as severe. I give this product an A+ and higher. It really works!"
4,The Excellent Wife,"This is a very good book with great principles. Some of the content is a bit far fetched at times, but overall, it really gets to the ""heart issue"" of being a wife in the sight of God. I would recommend it as a group study with other women though. Great book!"
