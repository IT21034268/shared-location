4,WARNING ABOUT ONLINE,I bought this game for it's awesome online experience.....but it should be noted that Ubisoft has takent the servers for the PS2 and PC servers down for online.
4,Excellent Christian Fiction,"I work in a Christian bookstore where one of my perks is getting to read a lot of Christian fiction. This is well above average in style, content, plot, and relevancy. The Christian message is loud and clear. Enjoyed it from the start."
5,New American Bible,"Bought for my wife for her use in her local church.Very pleased with it,very acceptable and satisfies all needs.Can recommend."
3,not user friendly,"The thing I do not like about this app is that I am not able to look up specific verses in the bible, I have go to the book in thebible & then go page by page to find the verse I want."
1,Disappointed!,"I was looking for a LARGE print Bible due to the fact that my eyes are getting so bad. I got this Bible and opened it up and it""s definitely NOT a large print. It's not much bigger than the small print Bible I already had and so I still have to use a magnifying glass to read it. I'm so disappointed and would send it back but it would cost too much so I will just have to deal with it. I would NOT recommend this Bible to anyone wanting a large print. I consider this false advertizing."
3,Nasb,i HAVE NOT LEARNED HOW TO GET TO VARIOUS PLACES IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. i.e>iSAIAH 53:3 TAKES ME FOREVER TO LOCATE VARIOUS PASSAGES. nEED MORE INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO NAVIGATE FROM PLACE TO PLACE.
2,too slow,I am trying to use this but it takes forever to get to the chapter I need before the Preacher changes chapters. It really needs to be quicker.
3,Missing the book of Tobit,"I bought this title and then returned it for the reason that it was missing the book of Tobit. All the other reviews about ease of navigation sold me on it, but what good is that if it's incomplete?"
3,Defect in Kindle version,I purchased this as a Kindle version. At some point it switched from English to another language. No indication as to why. Couldn't switch back to English. Had to purchase another version. Just to give you a heads up !
3,NAS Bible,The print is pretty small and no red letters where Jesus speaks.. I will look this up next time. The Bible is easy to carry around with soft cover.
5,NASB version of the Holy Bible is fantastic,"First the more up to date American version of English is much easier to read and interpret the deeper meaning of scripture for me.Also, it is formatted perfectly for my Kindle Fire. Search and bookmark features make it very easy to mark multiple places as I'm reading the Old Testament, Psalms and the New Testament at the same time. I recommend this version highly especially for people like me that like to read scripture directly and not have to interpret Old English in my head first."
2,NOT Large Print,"This should not be labeled a ""Large Print"" bible. I was very disappointed with the size of the print, thinking that if it said Large Print that is what it would be. I would consider the print to be just average size (maybe even somewhat small). The binding and cover are good quality. The ink does not seem particularly dark to me. This review is for the hardcover cloth edition."
2,out of date,"While this guide may have once been useful, in my opinion it hasbecome out of date. In my experience consulting firms have recentlydramatically changed the format of case interview questions and morerecent reflection of the new trends in case interviewing can be betterfound..."
1,WHAT THE HECK IS THIS!! NOT WHAT I ORDERED.,I ORDERED THIS FOR A RETIREMENT GIFT. I ORDERED THE A PITTSBURGH STEELERS MASCOT AND GOT I PITTSBURGH STEELER WORKER. I WAS SO PISSED!!! RETIREMENT IS ON SATURDAY AND NOW I WILL HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO GET THEM. TAKE THIS CRAP BACK.... I DON'T RECOMEND ANYONE TO USE THIS VENDER.............
2,Just an Index,"Considering the price tag that this text carries, one would be much better off buying any other Maimonides text. This book is nothing more than a supporting document of the Mishneh Torah and the Guide for the Perplexed. It doesn't nothing but direct the author in one of these directions. There aren't even any excerpts from the texts, just the classic, ""see my writing in..."". Don't waste your money. The only thing it does say is that Maimonides believed in a resurrection of the dead."
2,loading your player,It looked as though this could be a simple MP3 player to load w/ music...It was unfortunate that Windows Vista was not compatible with this player;I was not pleased that i had to send this piece of equipment to someone else just to load it....Sony NW-E003 1 GB Flash Digital Music Player (Silver)
5,One tough MP3 player !,"I purchased this MP3 player after reading many MP3 player reviews and decided this player offered the best value for me. This was a Christmas present for my granddaughter and she was thrilled to get it. A few days after Christmas my daughter informed me that the MP3 player had survived a near disaster. It was inadvertantly dropped into a toilet. After allowing the player to dry for a few hours, my granddaughter charged the battery and began using it and continues to use it trouble free !"
1,"Looks great, cheaply made","I bought three pair of these slippers last Christmas, and by Valentine's Day, two pair had completely fallen apart. The third recipient did not wear his much and they lasted until spring."
3,,"Mixed feelings always arise whenever a ""best of"" compilation is released. I guess in Nightwish's case, it signifies the end of an era considering the departure of Tarja a few months back. So, not much can be said about this album. We all know Nightwish's brand of ultra-symphonic Metal, and many of their gems such as ""Stargazers"" and ""Bless The Child"" are present here, while sacrificing monumental numbers like ""Beauty of the beast"" and wizardry-stompers like ""Moondance"". 16 tracks in total with 2 ""new"" songs consisting of a 2005 version of ""Sleeping Sun"" and a live version of ""High Hopes"", which is a Pink Floyd cover (both not that impressive). Included is a DVD with three live songs."
4,Great Book,A must read for all business men. The case studies are a bit dated now due to the ago of the book but they are still great lessonshttp://www.linkedin.com/in/davidhughes1
5,great book!,this book is just FULL of pictures and reading it is like taking a tour - without actually being there - but still being able to see it in your imagination and with the help of pictures :-) great book!
1,Abusive Parenting Method,"The American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children convened a task force on Attachment Therapy/Parenting because of the numerous high profile criminal child abuse and death cases associated with these practices. The task force found (in the journal *Child Maltreatment* Feb 2006) that the parenting method that Nancy Thomas promotes is ""inappropriate for all children"" and recommended child welfare workers investigate where it is used as ""suspect abuse."" (Thomas is mentioned by name in this report.) The American Psychological Association adopted the APSAC task force's recommendations and findings.This is clearly a professional condemnation of Attachment Therapy/Parenting, for which Thomas as been a ""leading blight."""
3,A French oriented view of Napoleon from an Englishman.,"Reading this book was really interesting for me as it contradicted things that I had been taught in my youth. I was brought up in an English biased school system, in Jamaica, and read books written by British writers. As a result my view of Napoleon has always been that he was a military genius whose genius and boundless energy was misdirected. This book contradicts that view and has motivated me to read more about him. I recommend it."
4,not bad,"I have a long weiner dog. My dachschund does not fit in the carrier only because he is too long. However, I have a friend that has a adorable mutt and it will fit him perfectly. I wanted this carrier to keep my lovebug close to me while I cook because his cousin is a bully and when my doggie gets too close to her dish she attacks. Alas, he is too long. But I bet it is good for a shorty."
2,Good but not Great,"Okay i got this carrier for my pomeranian who is 6 lbs, and this fit her perfect, but it didnt hold her up like the picture does, she slouches down and no mater how much i tighten it she still slouches, they need to have more upper strapes. I like the structer and design of it but its not very good in holding her in place"
2,caution,I was excited to recive as I also own the sling ted to recive as I also own the sling by outward hound. Unfortunatlng by outward hound and love it. Unfortunatly was a bit dissatisfied with this front carrier. The front part is well constructed and sturdy but then the actual straps that go over your shoulder are flimsy and thin. I wish they would have padded them like normal backpacks but the straps make me worried about the lack of support from the straps. The pic of the model looks nice but when I wore it looked about ten months prego and struggled to walk upright. Might just be me but if the straps worked more like a backpack it would have been great. Just feel they cut cost on the worse part.
1,Extremely disappointing,"I was going to write a review to warn readers (listeners) away from this book, but, after reading the review of Mr. A entitled ""THEY PLUMP WHEN YOU COOK THEM"", I decided that he had expressed my thoughts exactly, and probably better than I could have put them. I agree with Mr. A's review completely.I listened to this as an audiobook, and I would add that I did not enjoy the reading of the book, either. It would certainly have benefited by a male and female voice to read the parts of Ms. Rand and Mr. O'Connor, so that the narrator would not have to endlessly repeat their names, which was extremely annoying.Overall, don't waste your time reading or listening to this book."
1,"HL-1450 ""Stinker""","I have had nothing but problems with mine. It uses a limited number of warning lights to indicate a multitude of problems by lighting them in different combinations; CONFUSING! It's very, very finicky with replacement cartridges and feeding different weights of paper. I had to continuously manually reset mine and clear feed problems and it's been to the shop three times in 2 years and now I'm informed it has ""major board problems too expensive to fix""!! It's a stinker alright. Now I have two cartridges for it left and Brother has seen fit to update its product line to a new model HL-2040 which is an updated 1450 except, of course, it doesn't use the same cartridges; ughh!!! Thanks Brother; you get a ""Got you"" on this one."
5,Very Pleasantly Surprised,"I've been providing computer consulting/installation and support services for about 15 years and have almost always recommended HP printers. They may not be the most advanced or full-featured but they tend to last for years. However, I've been disappointed by HP's low-end laser line and decided to look for alternatives (the build quality on the LaserJet 1200 is poor - particularly the paper tray).After reading a lot of reviews, I decided to try the HL-1450. I was very skeptical that it would deliver all it promised: speed, output quality, standard USB and parallel interfaces, easy setup, and low operating cost all at a price that is half what the LaserJet 2200 costs.I purchased 1 for a client and have since purchased 2 more. They have been using them for about a month and have been very happy with them. I wouldn't hesitate at recommending them to my other clients."
2,Beware of this printers faults!,"I have owned this printer for over a year and a half (bought new)and at first it printed clean and crisp pages but not anymore! Pages are dingy grey colored and warped. I have not even used all the original 3,000 page toner cartridge and now the drum unit is shot! Brother claims a new drum and toner will fix this problem but, others state differently. Besides, the cost of a drum ($179.99) and a 3,000 print toner ($56.00)is more than I paid for the entire printer! Too bad Brother, I'm going to Lexmark or HP for my next lazer printer."
5,Read the reviews below and believe!,"Yep, finally a Bruce Hornsby DVD concert that is as close to the real thing you'll get- especially for folks like me who only dream of going to the US and actually seeing him.Excellent DVD. Trust the reviews."
4,Helpful,"I found this book to be helpful and informative. I had no idea how prevalent male depression was - the book helped me in understanding the cause in my situation, as provided answers toward working through my depression,"
5,There's not many out there--don't pass it by.,"I recently was in the home of a friend and picked up this book. It is a Christian book and is published by a Christian author--it is intended to be that. It sheds a lot of light on a subject that is not talked about in such a coherant and well-rounded way as in this book. I have struggled to understand the struggles of my family members and I have read several books in the past, but this book addresses several issues that I have been looking for information about...such as information about medication, what to do if depression is mild or severe, how you can help if you are a spouse, and though this may make some people uncomfortable how it depression relates to sex--because it does. I would encourage any wife struggling to understand her husband or other male family member's depression to read this book."
3,Average book.,My old Michigan Wildflower book was over 25 years old. I thought this one would have much more wildflowers in it. It did not. I was somewhat dissapointed in it.
4,fishing hat,"This hat is worth the money you pay for it. It is not for a 5 yr old as the two straps under your chin are a pain to keep even and they meet in the middle so there is no way to keep one at the back of your head. I am thinking of taking the strap appart and putting the back side one over the brim. Also, the brim is flemsy compared to a similar style hat I have had before. All in all, this had is a good had for an adult."
3,"Affordable, but somewhat fragile.","This product could be designed by the Japanese, judging by how efficient it works. My only complaints are that one of the zippers broke immediately, and the strap is coming off. Also, the power chord is too short. Otherwise, I am happy with it."
5,good for the price,"The first thing you learn when you set up your pedal board, is that you probably didn't need a pedal board. It is nice and convenient to plug in the pegs, and not deal with 9v batteries, but really, you will find your pedals sit velcro-ed to the board (in it's bag) and you don't really care. Ok, serious musicians won't apply here, but the average hacker, needs one stomp, crunch-overdrive. The rest is to feel like you can do cool stuff. So that is my take. Buy it. If you use it, you got your money's worth, if you don't you can show your friends you have a pedal board :)"
3,Very Soft,"I like the texture of this scarf however it isn't as as wide as I had hoped, just long in length & tends to have it's material very minimally fall off (featherly). But overall, is fine for the price. I wanted to magic scarf but it was sold out."
2,Geography text and not a story,"I feel bad for giving such a poor rating to this book. This world is incredibly well-developed as far as geography and history is concerned. It's the work of years. However, the story itself is lacking not the point of non-existence. There is a plot, but it is little more than a device that allows cardboard cut-out characters to wander Mr. Kirkpatrick's extremely well-realized world. For some, that may be enough, but for me, not so much. The prose is outstanding when it comes to describing features of the world. It falls flat when it calls for dialogue or when characters interact with one another. As a result, the book fails."
3,Nice Printer...awful software,"Well, the printer itself isfantastic...but I can't get the scanner& & fax software to stay functional on my Win 2000 computer. When I stripped the install down to just the printer driver I have had no problems. I didn't really need the scanner and modem capabilities anyway...I give it 3 stars because of the poor software, but the mechanical functionality of the unit (super quiet, FAST warm up to first page, and quick) I give 5 STARS!"
1,Agony for Windows XP users,"This is my second Brother MFC. I was reasonably happy with it when I was using windows 98. But I recently bought a new computer with windows XP, and trying to get this thing to work properly with XP has been a nightmare. After hours of download tutorials and uninstalling and reinstalling drivers from the Brother web site, it still does not work properly. Under no circumstances should you put the driver CD that comes with the unit in your CD drive if you are using XP. Beware also: The ""updated"" printer + scanner drive on the Brother web site does not work properly. A separate printer-only driver does work, but then you don't have all of the fancy scanning and character recognition stuff.For those who are still using windows 98, this is probably a reasonbly good unit if you want a combined laser printer/scanner/fax machine."
4,Almost flawless performance !,"I bought this machine 2 months ago for my small business. We use it both as a fax machine and a laser printer. So far, it has handled just about any type of task we have thrown at it flawlessly. It handles hundreds of pages of ""normal"" size documents every day. We were especially impressed when we printed on hundreds of ""odd"" size envelopes with various thickness and had only four paper jams. (that's when we pushed it's limits)The machine is efficient and very fast. Print quality is adequate for text but only fair for photos. The availability of a high yield (6000 pages) ink cartridge is a plus. It is only slightly higher in price and it's capacity is unmatched by competitors.The only major fault with this machine is, all of it's functions can not be used with windows XP. Hopefully, Brother will update it's current XP software on line. Long term reliability is unknown.Good luck."
2,amaturish production,"As a big Dr. Who fan, I'm complety disappointed. The worst thing about the sixth season of Who is the sound. Often the music and/or incidental sounds are so loud they drown out what the actors are saying. The first 4 years of the new series are fantastic, and the acting and production are superb. But the new doctor overacts, and not in an entertaining fashion.goodbye Doctor."
5,Great mid season cliff hanger,This is one of the best mid season cliff hangers and well written shows in the last 5 years. Everything is always well written and worth multiple viewings.
1,Dry,"No colors, no pictures, nothing interesting and enticing. As a textbook for an undergraduate class, it is extremely boring and dry. Yes, you CAN write an interesting and informative textbook that is captivating - but this one is NOT. Nope, I won't recommend it."
5,Tervis Tumblers are the best cups ever made.,"I promise, if you own these, you'll never buy another cup unless you are like me, and become addicted. I have over 20 of them, in various sizes. They are my GO-TO gift for anyone and everyone. They come in so many wonderful styles and colors, and patterns that you are sure to find something that you like. They don't sweat. They keep hot liquids hot. They keep cold liquids cold. They are dishwasher safe, and have a lifetime warranty. Not that you'll need it because I promise you, they are AWESOME~"
1,Do not purchase this.,"This and several other FMA OST CD's are in a Sony copywrited protection format that is no longer supoorted. If the description says 'imported' this is most likely the case.Support for this system ended in 2008, so the only way to listen to the content is with the CD in your computer using a non-traditional player.I spent several month trying to find some way to play this on a differnt player and consulted with technically savvy people.Although the songs are great, purchasing this CD is a waste of money."
5,Olivia de Havilland is Almost Terrifying!,"I love Olivia de Havilland, she is one my favorite 'Golden Age of Hollywood' actresses. I have seen her in movies when she was very young and the Studios made her do comedies, and she is precious in them. This performance is incredible, she portrays the personality of Rachel to a T. Is she a cold blooded murderess or isn't she? I have never been a huge Richard Burton fan, however, for his first movie, his 'over the top performance' works well here. He comes across very brooding, and is he obsessed with Rachel, or are his fears well grounded? I would recommend this to people who truly like mysteries. In my opinion the only reason it is not quite as good as Rebecca is because Alfred Hitchcock unfortunately did not direct it!"
3,Thomas Jefferson,"I found that this DVD gave a good perceive of ""Thomas Jefferson"", but had to watching ""John Adams"" to get the total picture of who Thomas Jefferson was and how he thought."
1,Do Not buy Grand Wega,Having purchased a Grand Wega a couple of years ago you will find that the Optical Block for this product will fail. Once it starts going dont expect much assistance from SonyCheck out 'Optical Block problems Sony' on the web for more details.Would not recommend any of this line of Sony TV's
2,Terrible Sound,"The sound quality is awful. The background music and sounds are fine, but the narration is way too quiet and can barely be heard over the rest of the sound. Disappointing quality."
3,A tad less inspired then part one,"While still a great came, quite better then most adventures; this sequel feels a little too rushed out to offically be called part two to syberia..It does at times lack direction and the narrative arc that made part 1 so appealing to play the whole way through, but it more then makes up for this with spectacular frozen locales and the chance to actually see the land you were promised in part 1.An all too rare series that truly transports the player to a foreign, magical land.."
4,One of the good ones,"If you like Atlantis & The Longest Journey you will like this. Not as good as the others, but good just the same."
2,Is this a joke?,"If I wanted to see breathtaking scenary and no storyline, I would have went to the mountains.The puzzles in this game are tedious and hardly worth anyone's time. The only thing keeping me going was the fact that I was finally going to get to see Syberia. From that little city, to the middle of nowhere (like the novel of Huck Finn) and finally to Syberia the game lacks any direction what-so-ever and the puzzles are those of repitition, not thinking.I fell asleep during the playing of this game numorous times.Save your money, buy a candy bar."
2,Not as useful as I thought.,"I have many Japanese friends and they tell me the verbs used in this book are rarely used in Japanese conversation. The only reason I still use it is conjugate verbs into te and ta forms. I would seriously consider anyone interested to look elsewhere, for this book has been a big dissapointment."
5,"Unique humor, cowboy style...","Having been raised in West Texas, I can attest to the amazing and oft times unbelievably rugged life that a true cowboy and cattle rancher must endure. In, Have Poem Will Travel, Dale Seawright has captured the true spirit of the Wild West in a unique and humorous writing style that embraces the epitome of a real cowpoke's adventurous lifestyle. This is an excellent book for all ages. Have Poem Will Travel should be in everyone's saddlebags, especially anyone who loves relaxing in the cool evening air and embracing the warmth of a mesquite campfire, the aroma of a cast iron pot of baked beans and freshly brewed coffee rising with the smoke curling gently into the air. Coupled with mental images of a herd of cattle grazing on an endless expanse of range grass where an occasional tumbleweed is seen bouncing across the terrain, stirred earlier in the day by an afternoon dust devil, reading Dale's poetry is a rare literary treat."
5,absolutely gorgeous,"Honestly, I find studying A&P tedious and generally boring. Purchasing Thieme's was the best move I've made. The plates are so beautiful that I want to linger on each page for a long time. Every person whom I've shown this book to said they wished they had bought it instead of Netter's."
1,Didn't work with me,"when i recieved the product i thought it's goin to be great , but it was a nightmare to spend all that amount of money, it didnt work it wasnt upgrading my cool edit pro 2.1 it was tataly useless so i contacted the seller and he offered making it up for me but antil this time he didnt ."
3,Final Fantasy XI with HDD,The Hard Drive Disk will enhance the Playstation2. I think it's a great bargain for those who want to save on their hard drive vs. memory card. Not sure how many gigs are on it. It will be like saving on the X-Box.
3,hard disc drive,didn't like the game but the hard drive rocks! It does everything the XBOX does for less money!
4,FFXI with HDD,"I played this game in the Japan version, it was great best Final fantasy ever, The HDD is somthing it didnt really need all it does is pumps up the price, HDD meaning hard disk drive, so wile playin this game you dont need a memory card. But all out its worth the price i can't wait for the American version to come out"
3,dont be fooled,"this game is cool in its own way but, is over shadower buy PlayOnline. they dont tell you you have to deal with a service provider that will over charge you and dubble charge.There web site is a joke the only thing you find there is run around. Dont try calling thier number ether, all youll get is a smart mouthed kid that is useless.all in all if you want the head aches that arent told to you before hand give this game a go.just keep in mind watch your credit cards. this game would be fun if it wasnt for PlayOnline"
1,stupid me,"asking for this retarded game and having someone waste 100 on dollars on a gift for me when I could have bought something fun or useful no more square enix for me i'm boycotting after this waste of time. A game without an ending or point is retarded, this game is for people who dress up like elves, goblins, hobbits etc. in their homes and want to share their idiocy with the world."
3,circle of pearls,it was ok. not as good as to dance with kings. Not as much insider type info of the times.
2,"Disappointing, with little substance","I didn't expect this book to be an unabridged encyclopedia of the Chevelle, but I expected a little more detail than it contains. It's a superficial overview of the model years without enough substance to satisfy someone (such as myself) looking for a little in-depth history and more detailed facts of the Chevelle.I can't speak to the accuracy of the specifications in this book as some other reviewers, but I must say that it falls far short of my expectations. It seems there are too few facts in this book for me to really review thoroughly."
5,Scenes of visionary enchantment...,"Ken Burns and Dayton Duncan have created a classic masterpiece with this work. Completed over 15 years ago, it still stands the test of time. The historical facts are as a rule, accurate, and the cinematography is breathtaking. While watching, you can become lost in time, transported into the ranks of the expedition. Having traveled the route of Lewis and Clark, as it makes it's way through the civilized world of today, I am amazed that throughout the hours and hours of footage shot, there is no sign of anything modern. I would recommend this set, as well as the musical soundtrack that is also available, to anyone with an interest in the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Schools especially should be interested, as this documentary makes the history come alive, which is just what children need to become engaged in learning."
4,sony nw e005,"i bought this mp3 player as a gift 4 my grilfriend, she realy like the violet coloer and he is very small and handy, the sound is also very good and after a few minutes learning it u can navigate pretty easy between songs and folders. it seems to have a good battery life but its still very new so its realy a good test."
5,Wonderful reading. The writer did an excellent job of taking you back to those hot summer nights of your youth.,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was a fast and easy read. The writing reminded me of my teenage (other) life. Memories of summer vacations in The Hamptons, partying with friends and young love. Great!"
5,Learning to know Bartok's music,"I'm having a tough time growing into some of his music but really glad I bought this, Excellent quality."
2,"Finicky setup, poor results",This product is really not up to spec. It took a while to get it working at all and still does not properly display video on my secondary display.Would not recommend for buying unless you have identical displays
3,Okay,"this book was okay but not that great. than again i don't like these types of books. Read it, actually read every thing! you can probaly guess what's its about by the title so i won't tell you and ruin it."
2,Canon Mini Tripod 7,I was disappointed with this Tripod. It is cheap and flimsy. It works (barely) and that is the most I can say for it. I can see now that there are many better on the market.
2,Tripod turns into Bipod,One of the legs broke off after using it for a few minutes. At least I have a cool-looking bipod. Cheap construction. Looks super cute though.
1,NOT for DSLR,This mini tripod is not capable of supporting a DSLR camera - I have a Canon Rebel T1i and it toppled right over.
3,That warm and fuzzy Evangelical feeling,"Whilst I will admit Tony Watkins text does provide an insightful overview of the His Dark Materials series, with specific analysis of each book, I found the bulk of the theme analysis in section three to be poor. Watkins overtly evangelical answers to the theological questions posed by Pullman's series, negates a thorough synthesis of historical theology and Philosophy. However, if it is spin you are looking for, then this text is for you."
1,picture looks big than actual earrings,"I think they should have taken a picture beside a person's ear. This was too small, like a kids jewelry! I had to return it."
5,Great Funny Romance,"This is one of my top five favorite Jude Devereaux books. `Ring Montgomery is a priceless character; a sexy, stubborn Dudley DoWright. I love his little cameos in Jude's other books. Enchanting, hilarious reading."
3,"I liked it, but not all that much.","For me, the story was a bit confusing, but I plan to read it again to get a better understanding. It was funny and romantic, but I've read better books from Jude Deveraux."
1,Dissapointing and misleading,"I bought this since my Christian name is Ignatius. But when I played it, it was in Spanish, no subtitles, spend hours just to get english out , I do not speak Spanish since I am Chinese american. Wasted time and at the end i gave it to my garder who speaks spanish. Amazon should not sell product with foreign languages (Spanish, russian, swahili) etc without ANY translation, after all we are in the USA. Wasted my money on this one."
2,Not the best Emeril's done,"I ordered these and then two other steak knives by Emeril so I'd have a set of six... the knives that came in the four pack aren't nearly as nice as the other two I bought. Also, the seasoning bottle was cracked and had spilt in the package. I'd recommend going into a store and looking at the knives before ordering online."
4,If you love ghost stories you'll love this book!!,Ghost House Revenge is the best ghost story I've read. If you love to be chilled to the bone you'll love this book. It seems like a Poltergeist story. With the all the horror you'll love this book by Clare McNally. I give it two thumbs up
2,Nothing new with this set. Boo HBO!!,"My low 2 Star rating is only for this Complete Set. I give the series as a whole 5 STARS. I wholeheartedly recommend owning the series, in either this form or individual seasons. But if you already own seasons one through four on dvd, don't bother with this set. There is nothing new going on here. Every extra is something that has already been seen on the individual season dvds. And according to the description here it may or may not contain the prequels from the season three set. You'd think we could have gotten some new commentary, or interviews with extended cast members, or audition footage, or bloopers, or gag reel, OR ANYTHING NEW. So if you don't own any Big Love yet, go right ahead a get this set. But if you already have others, just complete your collection with the individual sets. Wasted opportunity to really give a fitting farewell to an undervalued, excellent show that never really got the support and accolades it deserved."
2,Nothing new,"Nothing in this book would surprise a woman, particularly one who has been cheated on, so there is no point in buying this book in hopes of clarifying why men cheat and how to spot it. A waste of money. If anything, borrow it from the library, at least then, it's free!"
2,"Women pull this crap, too","I've seen plenty of the things men are accused of in this book done by women to men. The book's notion that women are soley the victims of men is myopic. If a partner in a relationship is reading this stuff, probably they are in a bad relationship. Maybe they should reexamine how they got into this relationship in the first place? I think social pressure for women to get married is at the root of the problem. Many will ""settle"" just to be married. If things don't click before you march down to the altar, they probably won't be that great after the I dos have been spoken. Many men take women at their word and unfortunately, that is a bad mistake."
4,Giselle 1969 DVD,"This is a good video. The dancing is great! My only problem with it is that since it is made for video, the director gets a little ""artsy"" and takes away a bit from the dancing with his creative touches. I was also disappointed that the credits are very limited. The only dancers credited at all were the principals and soloists. Still worth the purchase."
1,A TRAVESTY OF DANCE,"How David Blair could allow this insult to the dancers is beyond me. I noted that some people liked the performance, but I'm at a loss to know how they actually saw the performance! Trying to watch an artist dance, through the back of huge hats, bad quality glass and anything else the director could find to put in front of them, was, to say the least, distracting. Add to that a camera that was moving so constantly that I almost felt sea-sick and editing that rarely stayed on the same shot for more than a few seconds and constantly interrupted the dance with completely irrelevant and distracting views of everything from a plate of fruit to galloping horses as seen from a galloping horse! Ballet is a theatrical art, but many others have shown that it can be totally cinematic. If you trust it and leave it alone, it will automatically weave its magic spell."
3,curious ballet-film,"This classical ballet is shown in a rather uncommon way. It seems that the director tried to merge the art of film and the art of dance to produce his own Giselle. The result of this experience is some for and against points. In my opinion the for points are the camera unusual closes, the interesting shots and the importance given on acting as well as on dancing. Considering the year of production the quality of image and sound are surprisingly goods. The against points are the excecive and sometimes disturbing cuts. I wouldn't say this is the definitive Giselle."
1,Padre Nuestro que estas En La Tierra,"Very Quick delivery,but the recording on the DVD was not The Right One.I'm Eager To Find This DVD.The cover is the right movie i hope you look foward to correct this error. Thank You"
4,"Simple, easy to follow for anyone to learn basic moves","This DVD sound track, background, and video quality is primitive in today's market. But that is not why you are buying this product. The goal is to learn the basic's in dance move if you are a ""wall flower"". His simple instructions, demonstrations and explanations are great, too the point, and anyone can learn the basics. At the end, I wanted more dance moves. If his other DVD's are as simple and to the point as this, he has done a great job. The only reason why I gave this a four star rating is the cost."
1,You better hope you don't need to call the company!,"I have had this printer for about a week. I have no complaints about the product, but I felt compelled to write a review because it is impossible to get anyone in this company to help you. The printer was giving me an error message yesterday, and I couldn't get it to work. I called the technical support number numerous times only to have a recorded voice tell me to that no one could take my call due to high call volumes and that I should call back later. When I e-mailed my question to technical support, I received a form e-mail saying that it would take three business days for me to get a response.Bottom line...I strongly recommend that you look to purchase another brand of printer. If anything goes wrong with your Brother printer, there won't be anyone to help you."
4,"Graduate Student Davis, CA","When looking at all the reviews that are listed for this particular printer, I was pretty worried since I have many deadlines that I could not risk having any problems with printing. However, I took the advice of Consumer Reports Magazine (who named this the pick of the litter) that this little printer is the way to go for efficiency and low-cost per sheet printing. I've owned this machine now for 2 months and have not had a problem yet. This printer has been working great and stays nice and quiet in it's standby mode until I call upon it to print my work. As opposed to previous reviews there have no driver problems with Win XP, MS Word, or Adobe. As for XP users, typically there is no need to install drivers since XP is designed to automatically install drivers on it's own. I gave this printer 4 stars out of 5 b/c I am still unsure of how long this printing bliss will last.But as for now, this printer is a great choice."
1,Jam-a-minute,"I got this after giving up on an HP6M I'd had for a number of years. It finally needed some work and I could get this for a decent price, so why not? It installed and hooked up great. But when it came to printing, particularly envelopes, it got indigestion and kept jamming.But not really. When I took the laser cartridge out, looked for the jam and found nothing, powered down, powered back up, it was good for three or four more envelopes, and whamo! Jammed again.Come back HP, all is forgiven...."
1,Worked for a while...,This printer worked ok for a while then started the toner issue that others have described. I bought a new drum but it didn't fix the problem. I now wish I never did!!! We are going to have to buy a new printer and toss this one in the trash. I also wrote to Brother about the issue... still waiting for a response (4 months later)
2,An absolute Nuisance,"I purchased 2 printers for my office of 14 people. We already have a Hewlett Packard. From day one this printer has been an absolute nuisance. It takes approximately 6 minutes for any job to reach the printer, and an additional 3 minutes for multiple pages to print.Once there is a jam - which happens often, or any sort of disruption with the print job, you have to turn the printer off for a few minutes to clear the memory, and send it again. If not, the error light will continue to flash even after the problem (jam, replenish paper etc.) has been resolved. My staff members have all gone back to printing to the HP; and this, along with the other new printer, a Brother HL-1230, sit idly by.Brother - never again"
5,Great Printer & Cheap,"While my firm has a network printer, I purchased the 1440 as my in-office printer for drafts, etc. I now use it for all my printing needs. My operating system is XPPro (installed without issues); upgraded to 34mgb through crucial -very inexpensive and easy. The print qualtiy is better than the expensive HP network printer. The 1440 is extremely quiet and quick. No priner jams or other problem - great buy."
1,Garbage,"I should have made sure I reviewed other folks comments who have owned the HL-1440 for 6 months or more on Amazon prior to purchasing this piece of junk.I've noticed over the past couple of months or so that I've had grey streaks appearing on print outs - recently, the alarm indicator has been flashing everytime I try to print. I've subsequently found out that my problems are symptomatic of a drum problem and told that I could replace it for the $160 !!!!I'm probably going to revert back to a colour inkjet printer, rather than spend another cent with Brother."
3,Setup of printer can be difficult.,"I am using a Mac computer with the OS X operating system, the software provided would not load. Had to down load from the Brother site, you have to choose between 2 or 3 drivers. Not being a computer genius, I down loaded the wrong driver. I called their customer support line for help, they have a support system that hangs up on you if they have too many calls pending. I find this unacceptable, plus not providing software that will run on the Mac OS X system is totally unacceptable. For the computer novice trying to get the printer up and running could be very frustrating. The print quality is great, and the speed is wonderful. I have had this printer for less than a week."
2,If you want a disposable printer....,"Worked very well until the original toner cartridge ran out (took about a year as I don't print much). Two days after I replaced it with a new OEM cartridge, it started printing a line vertically down every page. After two hours of troubleshooting, I tossed it, leaving me with a completely full $80 toner cartridge that I couldn't return."
2,Problems after several months,"Over the past 12 months I have knowledge of three different HL-1440 printers experienceing print quality problems. After working great for several months, the pages printed begin to have a grey background of toner all over the page. Then streaks of toner develop. The problem gets worse over time. Brother claims that the toner needs to be replaced, but the toner is NOT empty on any of the printers. Cleaning the drum unit doesn't work either. In the long run, this printer is not worth the money saved."
1,Poor Print Quality After Six Weeks,"The first month was great. After six weeks of daily use (about 20 pages per day) a black haze started to cover every page, progressively getting worse. I cleaned the printer with the special cleaning pads and this did not help. I then cleaned the drum and wire. This also did not fix the problem. Next I replaced the toner cartage, and this also did not fix the problem. Finally I replaced the drum and it worked great! The drum did not last the life of one toner cartage. The fix was over [$] for a [$] printer! NOT HAPPY! The printer is also slow to warm up on the first page."
1,Brother Should Stick to Sewing Machines,"I have complained to PC World and PC Magazine about their high rating of this printer. It's not XP compatible. I've downloaded every driver update to no avail. Finally, Brother suggested I ""trick"" my XP system by using an old HP driver. It works....some of the time. Every time I push the print button I flinch because I expect the dinging of ""printer error."" To make matters worse, it keeps printing garbled pagers over and over again until you turn the printer off or reboot. It won't let you delete the data. If you're using XP, run, don't walk away from this printer. Brother should stick to sewing machines."
2,Drum died after 12 months,"I bought this printer because of the initial low price. I must admit for the past year it has printed very well. I never experienced the ""gray-background"" printing issues of other reviewers. However, my printer just suddenly *died*. A little troubleshooting revealed the problem to be the printer drum. The cost of replacing the drum is almost the price of buying a new printer ($130-150). After reading page after page of negative reviews from other Brother owners, I have decided that the money for a new printer drum would be better invested in a new printer from another company. I won't buy another Brother."
1,What? No split screen?,"I bought this for my kids because according to the box, up to 4 players can play at the same time.Well, as it turns out, that means 4 different players with 4 different Xboxes... Yeah, like most siblings are going to patiently take turns playing this together. Most parents know better than to buy games for 1 player when they have more than one kid in the house, it just doesn't work.So, I thought the labeling was very misleading.From what I could tell, the graphics looked pretty good but I don't much else about the game play and all since I hid this game from my kids, so I can quit hearing them fight over who gets to play."
3,it's a dvd,"Campy and corny, my 7 year old likes it a lot, didn't love it. My 10 year old son thinks it's too young for him. And my 3 year old daughter isn't interested. It's okay."
1,Save you money,This item was not functional. The Model 700 would not completely fit into the sleeve even if you removed the antenna. An inexpensive camera case would be more appropriate for the job. Before I bought my GPS I rented a car from Dollar who had Garmin products. Their case was perfect. Too bad Magellan can't produce one.
2,Mediocre,"Typical, generic fantasy. The whole plot, setting and characters sound vaguely familiar, so unoriginal are they. I'd have to say the best thing about the book would definitely be the awesome cover. If you're really bored, it's worth a read, but otherwise, don't bother. This book taught me (once again) that judging books by their covers doesn't work."
2,just more religious propaganda,"i thought this was going to be about what was happening in the world, not religious propaganda. there were many incorrect things being stated here from the bible as well to fit this films agenda. they are just as guilty of deception as they are accusing everyone else. time will tell though, time will tell."
1,"Nothing new here, just more gobbly-gook from the Christians.","Disappointing! Wish I could get my rental money back. I had no idea It was connected to the Church's agenda. Like so many videos today they are deceptive in trying to get you to watch by appearing not to be a Christian production...thus ""anonymous""?What a joke."
5,Great Info,The researcher did a great job in putting ALOT of info together and showing how it all ties in with what the Bible says about the age in which we live.
2,Captain Feathersword: Sailing Around the World,"Would be a better title for this DVD. We bought it after coming off the energy from the Live! Hot Potatoes video, and expected the same type of energy in preparation for the Sailing Around the World Concert. And there was virtually no sign of our four Wiggles.I also have to agree with another review. As an adult who actually gets into some of the catchy Wiggles music, I didn't really enjoy any of the music in this DVD, except for Londontown.We're now back to the LIVE DVD 24/7."
1,Should be ZERO star...terrible DVD,"I only wished I had read the reviews before purchasing this CD. It was just bad. Captain Feathersword & crew was incoherent most of the time and the songs weren't even good. What happened to the Wiggles and why is the Captain playing such a huge role? The Wiggles didn't sail at all, they were not in any of the location shoots, only the the Captain travelled."
2,My Toddlers Didn't Enjoy As Well As Other Wiggles,"Gone are the upbeat songs and catchy lyrics that my toddlers enjoy so much (and me too).The Wiggles don't even appear that much in this video. Captain Feathersword and the dancers sail around the world and intro the upcoming cities. Songs are about the cities and not the Wiggles usual catchy, silly songs. I think the Wiggles must have been gone on tour somewhere and left Captain Feathersword in charge of this one. The Wiggles don't appear that much. My toddlers usually love the Wiggles but this video doesn't even hold their attention. If your child is a little older and can follow lengthy dialog then they may enjoy this or if Captain Feathersword is their absolute favorite. But for my toddler boys, they just want to sing and dance around like crazy with the Wiggles.I recommend Top of the Tots for enjoyable songs that you will find yourself singing along with. We still love the Wiggles (especially the blue one) but this video falls short."
1,Ridiculously Simple-Minded,"This is more like ""Surviving College for those in a Permanent Vegetative State."" I don't see how any 18-year-old could learn a thing from this; everything this guy says is painfully obvious and dumbed-down. It also has a weird conservative slant throughout. The chapter on sex sounds as though it were written by a Christian evangelical. The section on abortion draws heavily from the ""research"" of a frothing-at-the-mouth anti-abortion ""institute,"" and is riddled with misinformation and cleverly worded distortions. Don't waste your money."
4,falling in love in a business marriage,"Efficient heroine is in a business marriage with successful & busy Hero the last 2 years. She now wants out of their marriage of convenience b/c she's in love with him & doesn't want an open marriage any longer. Hero wants to their marriage to be a real one but heroine believes it's only a ploy to continue her work as his competent personal assistant. So she invents a lover to compel him to agree to a divorce. But Hero doesn't seem upset by it & instead appears to be understanding & still willing to preserve their marriage.For a Hamilton book, this was pretty good. It had a good romance & sexual chemisty. Hero & heroine didn't fall in love at 1st sight but fell in love with each other during the time they spent during their 2-year marriage. The main characters' Big Misunderstanding & cross-purposes were emotionally-stirring. As Hamilton's usual, sex scenes were generalized.Recommended."
1,Never Assume,"I am really sorry to have to say that this was the most aggravating book I have read to date. It took me 4 days to read it because it got so on my nerves I had to put aside. Claire is so intent on believing that her husband, on paper only, didn't care about her that she was driving herself to distraction. She couldn't or would't think that her husband loved her even after all the hints he was leaving for her. There is one line in the book where he says to her: Are you too stupid to understand? Well I have to say she was too stupid all the way through the book to realize anything about how this man felt. This is not a book I would ever recommend to anyone. And I will first really look into any more of Diana Hamilton books before I buy them."
2,Burned out in a few days.,"First of all the lights arrived with one of the switches broken. It was always on. Not a big deal since I just unplugged the light when I didn't need it. Just the same it was annoying. I'd have sent it back, but by that point I had already put the light together and did not want to go through the hassle of taking it apart and exchanging over a broken switch.What did annoy me is the fact that both halogen bulbs that came with the light died after at most 40 hours of use.Also, the lights only tilt UP not DOWN. So if you need the lights to shine on the floor or say down into the engine bay. Sorry."
4,Good recording of a true classic piece,"It is a good recording of a truly classic piece, even though the composer himself hated it."
5,nice short stories for my tween,Perfect easy little short stories for my tween who is going through many changes. Promotes positive self esteem and body image. Book arrived in great shape and timely.
3,95% Depression; 5% Redemption ....,"""The Secret Life of Words"" may tax the patience and endurance of many viewers. Two forlorn individuals - Sarah Polley (Hanna) and Tim Robbins (Josef) have more baggage than an O'Hare skycap. Both are scarred, emotionally and physically.Hanna nurses Josef after the latter is badly hurt and burned in an oil rig accident. She is a battered survivor of atrocities during strife in the Balkans. She works in a factory in Copenhagen but is aloof and distant from her co-workers. As their relationship grows and deepens, they peel back the layers and barriers they have built around their emotional lives. (Polley bears an uncanny resemblance to Uma Thurman.)The characters - a skeleton crew - aboard the oil rig are a quirky bunch.Perhaps 95% of this movie is a depressing downer. The closing suggests the possibility of love's healing and redemptive powers.SSSSSSSSLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOWWWW paced....."
4,Foodies best mag,"Saw this magazine at someones house 6 yeaars ago, loved it and got my own subscription. I make sure to never let it lapse. With the internet and all this is the only mag. I actually have delivered. I go through every issue, photo copy the recipes I like and pass on the magazine to others who love getting my ""used"" magazine. Well worth the Amazon price."
2,didnt fit my face,Looked nice on the package but at the end it didnt completely fit my face and had some gaps in between. Therefore it did not work for dust protection. I sent it back to amazon. It may well work for you but I would recommend to try it in the store first.
3,Not so good for working out in the heat,"They fit well and look nice, but we bought them for my husband to use when he is working out in the yard and garden--mowing, tilling, etc. He can't really use them for that because they get too hot and he sweats in them and they fog up."
1,Blue Oyster Cult Extended Versions?,"I thought I was buying a Studio album not a Live album when I brought this,it is misleading on the back of the cd in small print it says Recorded Live! It has Don't Fear but it's Live(I prefer the Studio Version) and it has Burning for you,other than that even if it was $2 the live album is not that good."
5,You Think You're Cool,"Go ahead - - play your Metal Machine Music and your Nurse With Wound and your :zoviet-france: and your Merzbow and your Obituary (!) at your next little get-together. All I ask is that somewhere in the middle of it all you also play just one track from the venerable Mrs. Elva Miller.Here is Uncle Autumfair's Absolutely Unconditional Guarantee: it will be Elva who will be remembered, discussed and ruminated over for weeks to come."
3,Didn't have the surprise at the end.,"I could only find this used, and it didn't have the surprise at the end, which was what was missing from another used copy I had."
1,Really?,"I don't agree with previous review completely,only because it didn't feel, like religious intrusions to me,but full religious trap.I paid for it too..."
5,The Premier Book on Past Life Regression,"Out of all the books on past life regression that I have read, this one is by far my favorite. The author style of writting is easy to follow, and does an excellent job of letting the information in the pages flow. If PLR is a subject that you are interested in, I Highly recommend you buy this book."
4,Good so far,"Installation is easy. No true wiping test yet for the blades as we've had no rain here since the installation and I've not yet driven during a snow fall. However, when I commence a ""window wash"" cycle on my wiper blades, they swipe smoothly and clean."
4,Spirituality,The book is a little more involved in technicalities than I expected. Other than that the book gives some interesting insights.
1,"This is superceded by a newer version, and is FREE","The latest version of this PAMPHLET is 8714r, and was produced in 1977 by the U.S. Bureau of Mines from the work of Broadhead and Heady. It is FREE, available online from the government (yeah, the Pueblo Colorado people), or can be downloaded free online. I only know this because while looking for a KINDLE version, I found that there are people CHARGING for this free government document, which is quite-wrong."
5,This book has a wide variety of excellent pictures.,"With all the great information this book gives on the trainers of Americas Pilots that protect us, it has some astonishing pictures in it that would make you very proud that you bought this book."
3,Immigrant Loyalists,"When the MacDonald family is kicked out of the States because they are not patriots, they must set out on an adventurous journey to Johnstown, Quebec, to build a home there. Many things happpen to them:-Baby Margaret dies-Mary makes a new friend, Hannah, with whom she attends school with-Jamie gets a pet dog, Laddie-Mary's brother comes back from the war with a friend, Duncan-They settle in a NEW HOMELAND!"
2,"OOPS! Useful and detailed, but it chaffes my paradigm...","I read through the first chapter, glanced at the others, started on the project in chapter one, then realized something. I use golive because I find the numbered column on the left side extremely useful. I'll bet this software if used to it's full capacity would be excellent in a production environment where you have several websites to build in a very short time. I don't have that affliction.I also noticed, after dragging and dropping the component parts for the web page, INLINE STYLES IN THE CODE! WHAT? WHY?I've spent too many years trying to understand what goes on under the hood of a web site and it's pages. GoLive seems to be more of a burden than a help!Truly, if you know how to write good algorithms, understand css,PHP, javascript, and MySQL, and can organize your files into a folder structure that makes sense to you, why not do it that way?I'm just saying...PS: Adobe just announced that it will no longer support GoLive."
5,Looks as Good as it Cooks!,"I already have a 4-quart dutch oven and wanted a larger one, which could be used to bake a chicken or simply for cooking for a larger group of people. So, my wife purchased the Lewis & Clark dutch oven for my birthday, which fits the bill--partly because it is a deep 12"" (8 quarts) and partly because it looks so good. I baked a whole chicken (with vegetables) in it last night and it worked perfect. I even managed to toast the top of the chicken without scorcing the bottom. The food looked like it was ready for a photo shoot. The oven worked great!The pre-seasoned cast iron was new to me. At first I was concerned because out of the box the surface of the pot was rough to the touch. However, after I used it last night I noticed that the pre-seasoning had smoothed out and now looks like a piece of cast iron cookware that has been in use for years! Amazing.Now if I can somehow figure out how to justify buying Lodge's 2-quart camp dutch oven, I'll be a happy cook.Jack"
2,NOT leather!!!!!!!,"The listing on this purse, when I ordered it, claimed that it was made out of leather. When I received it, I found that it is most definitely NOT leather and so hugely over-priced. The look, smell and feel of this was more like plastic. I contacted the company and they gave me only a partial refund plus I had to cover shipping charges to return this worthless bag. If you don't mind paying almost $30 for a NON-leather purse then go ahead and buy it. But, if you are shopping for a high quality leather handbag then don't waste your time or money on this item!"
2,Lack of specifications...,"I would like to know, if this edition of Precalculus brings the code access webassign? I just need the code, the book many of my friends have told me that is not the best out there."
4,GOOD CONDITION,ITEM ARRIVED IN GOOD CONDITION AS PROMISED BUT A LITTLE BIT LATE AND EMAILS TO SELLER WHERE NOT RETURNED. OTHERWISE GOOD TRANSACTION.
4,Good text,"I like this math textbook. The quality of the book itself is good, and the material inside is full of colorful and can be applied to the real world. However, the CD that came with the text does not work on my Mac which is only a couple of years old. It says its compatible with my OS but the program will not launch."
1,pseudoscience,"This book encourages readers to try ineffective approaches and diets to solve imaginary problems, or problems that are better treated by mainstream medicine. My healthy thirty-something friend read this book back in 2005, and became convinced that he had to follow the nonscientific cures mentioned in the book. This year, my friend died--in pain--convinced that medical science could not help him, and convinced that antibiotics had caused his problems. This book is quackery-- buyer beware. Put your trust in mainstream medicine--it actually is effective most of the time."
3,informative yet dated and poorly organized..,"'The Yeast Connection' by Dr William Crook has most everything you want to know about yeast (Candida) infection. The author really knows his stuff; his many years of treating patients with Candida are reflected well in this book. However the book is very repetitive, very jumbled and is very dated (written over twenty years ago). But I think for most people interested in the topic this book would be satisfactory overall.The only content missing from this book is a thorough discussion on (non-prescription) supplements that can be used to combat Candida. The author only references caprylic acid and garlic. In fact there are many others. Instead the author talks endlessly about nystatin, a drug only available through prescription. Sometimes this book reads as if his target audience is doctors versus folks suffering from Candidiasis.Bottom line: certainly a useful book but I would expect there are better and newer ones out there."
4,Yeast Connection,"A very informative book. I have read several books on yeast and very few give this much information. Although , it was a bit hard to digest all of the information. There were lots of guides on how to cope with yeast.. Many references to helpful institutions and organizations were listed. Suggestions for getting well and remaining healthy were given. The book helps one to understand the ordeal of confronting the illness as well as the problem of getting help. I feel that all medical students should have to read this book. I would recommend it to anyone with health problems that they can not resolve."
1,Does not work in Streamlight Stylus,"These AAAA Ultralast batteries do not have the little bump on the positive end as you would expect in a AA, AAA, or any other battery.The positive end is almost completely flat. Strangely, the negative end has a weird counter-sunk hole with a bump in it, but that bump does not extend past the end of the battery.As a result, the stack of 3 of these batteries is just over 1/8"" shorter than a stack of normal-looking Energizer AAAAs. The button on the flashlight does not go down far enough to connect, and it won't turn on."
5,"For Horse People, this is a riot","For Horse People, this is a riot. I found myself laughing out loud even though I don't ride English. But I've loved Thelwell for years."
3,Hyper Lite II Tested,Good buy for the price. Survived heavy thunderstorms and winds with minimal seepage. vestibule added feeling of extra security although small for 2 persons and not so light as the name would have you think.
1,beware consultants gushing over their patrons.,"Here's an idea: go back to all your clients with big budgets and write a book that vomits viscous, sickening praise all over them. CEOs, especially wanna-be celebrities like Branson just LOVE to be feted. This isn't a book, it's a direct-mail piece.I got through about 50 or so pages when I realized that life was too short. Interesting how the great geniuses of our time can't seem to cover the basics. Here's a clue-- everyone has wacky ideas-- they're written down on cocktail napkins everywhere. ""Thinking out of the box"" and all of its related concepts contributes to success about as much as regular bowel movements. Just once, I'd like to see someone write about ""committment to follow through"" or ""excellence in implementation"", but I suppose such ideas are too vulgar to be considered by high thinkers."
1,Hogwash. Poppycock. Warmed over toast,"What can one say of a bunch of loose ideas stitched together under the guise of a concept. I appreciate the need for deviants to act in accordance with deviancy but this takes the cake. Why anyone would want to publish such a load of self-important drivel, I'll never know.Please, DO buy this book and light a fire with it!"
1,Awwww this is sad =(,"I have a 50 page rule, where I don't put the book down or make any comments about it until 50 pages into the reading. This is a book that *should* be good. After all, the plot is excellent. I don't know what it is, though, but this book is just not appealing to me, and I usually love historical novels. The writing is too scientific and precise, and the use of Italian words for common words like ""family"" and ""lady"" is plain obnoxious. Is this a feeble attempt to appear cultured and multilingual? It's not working. I would love to see this work reworked, because it breaks my heart to write this review, especially considering someone sat down and took some effort to write this book."
5,Outstanding historical fiction,"This book describes the life of a 15th-16th century Italian Jewess. The main conflict revolves around her love for an Italian nobleman vs. her loyalty to her faith. It's beautifully written, historically rich, and relevant to anyone today who is struggling with the same issues. And yes, while it is not a romance novel, it has one sizzling ""romantic"" scene to give the book a little added spice!"
5,Sparkling and Evocative,"A collection of beautiful alternate tuning fingerstyle guitar pieces, with a few vocals, a la Windham Hill or Narada. Has a bit of the feel of the late Michael Hedges, a little Shadowfax, and of course, there is that wonderful version of ""Walk Away Renee"" with David Wilcox. Listen to ""Ancora Un Istante"" beautifully sung and played by Mr. D'Agostino. It's a song you'd like to hear at sunset in an outdoor Italian cafe -- after which, you'd cancel your ticket home.More than a year after I wrote the review above, I had the good luck to go on the first cruise sponsored by Acoustic Guitar Magazine. Peppino D'agostino was one of the teachers, and he is as nice a human being as his music is beautiful. I saw him after dinner and casually mentioned how much I liked his version of ""Walk Away Renee."" He replied ""bring down your guitar, I'll show it to you."" Bravo Peppino. . .."
1,Cheap Plastic,"Cheap plastic body. The base which connects to the shoe WILL break off. Even Nikon mounts will break and they are made way stronger than this knockoff. I'm guessing they are trying to ""corner"" the market on all of the Nikon D40's that are being sold because the Nikon flash is so expensive. I'm returning this one before I break it and i'm SOL. It lookis like the second level stuff they sell at Ritz. I saw it on here for 199.99...WHAT? I paid $100 for it and i'm pissed."
5,"Horrendous, factual atrocity","TF Mou, director of Men Behind teh Sun pulls no punches in this, the only film to show the atrocities of Nanking. Not for the faint of heart but a must for people interested in the Nanking Massacre. Real footage was used during some of the film from the footage Father McGee shot will trying to help the people of Nanking.If more people watched films like this I think the world would be better off from it."
2,Black Sun - The Nanjing Massacre,Acting and production is generally poor but the subject matter and 'real' footage is compelling and should never be forgotten.
5,Grace is rockin' awesome!,"Grace is an awesome trainer. She makes you work hard and that really pays off! She's done an amazing job of getting the tunes to go with her moves. Thanks, Grace!"
5,Amazing WORKOUT!,"When i bought this DVD i was excited and very thrilled to find a fun, entertaining workout. Grace is such an inspiration on the DVD, i could really feel here through the television. When i began the work out i knew this was going to be a great exercise for my core, and my entire body!!! The Entire time i felt the moves were working my legs, arms and core. The way she makes us move i feel as though she can really know what target areas to reach for everybody. The Music was great to... she speaks to her audiance as though they are actually in the room with her and she gives not only great workout advice but advice on how to maintain your body and keep the energy in your life positive and uplifting!!! My mom and I have started to do the video together! Hope fully we both can Be ROCKIn MODELS!!!"
5,Strong and quite flow!,Have this on my 20g long and it can circulate the water from one end to the other. Priming it can be a little pain but you only do it once in awhile. This filter is very quite!!
4,Good overview for Oracle on Unix,"This book is an excellent overview of how the Oracle RDBMS runs on the various flavors of the Unix operating system. Knowledgeable Oracle DBA's will take away many performance tuning tips with a complete understanding of why, when, and how to implement. The first two chapters on The Unix Kernel and Paging/Swapping should be required reading for anyone administering Oracle on Unix."
4,Real world Oracle Tuning Book...,"The book covers Oracle,Unix and Hardware issues in equal depth. It is very much detailed (though there are very few errors) and better than most of the Oracle Tuning books."
2,Cute - but oh so shallow,"Every entry in this collection is a good start on the subject - but that's it. As soon as it gets interesting, the authors move on to the next factlet. This may be fun for ""Hey, did you know that..."" type of conversations, but as soon as someone wants more information, you're out of this book's depth. After a while, it gets frustrating to read - in fact, it's the only book of this type I had to force myself to finish. Plus, the authors' adherence to an apparent 5th grade reading level, with no order or clear chronology even within each entry, makes it even more annoying.If you want an outline of interesting tidbits, or if you're not yet in high school, you may enjoy this book (in fact, it wouldn't be a bad gift for some little inventor you may know, up to about age 13). But if you want depth, insight, and a touch of adult-level irreverance and humor, go elsewhere (personally, I'm a BIG fan of Cecil Adams)."
5,A very readable history of the first movie cowboy.,"This is a well told story of the first movie cowboy hero and about the original development many aspects of how to tell a story with moving pictures. It is a well researched book, but is quite readable. It would be of interest to the casual fan of the movies, not just the serious student silent film. There are many beautifully detailed stills and publicity shots.""Broncho Billy"" Anderson was at one time famous around the world. Now he may be forgotten, but much of the language of the movies that we take for granted was invented by him and by his contemporaries. Broncho Billy was in many ways ahead of his time, understanding right away the value of realism and authenticity and the importance of involving the camera as closely with the action as possible.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of the movies or the West."
3,does the job,"Unfortunately, there aren't a whole lot of choices when it comes to anchoring sheds that aren't on a foundation, but it gets the job done...just check the specs to see which size you need"
5,Review on '1991 the Year Punk Broke',"'1991 The Year Punk Broke' Is a must if you are a Sonic Youth fan.Scenes you have never seen before of Sonic Youth,Dinosaur Jr. Babes in Toyland and Nirvana.Its like having a backstage pass for a couple hours.I fully recommend it. END"
3,did not keep correct date,I have had this watch since summer of 06. This leap year I have noticed the watch had not kept the correct date despite the fact that I have set the leap year correctly (on three separate occasions). The reason I got this watch was so I would not have to worry about ever having an incorrect date. For some reason the watch had problems with the begining of march and the end of march. Just today I looked at my watch and it said it was April 1st. When it said yesterday was March 30 (31 days in March). I am kind of pissed.
5,Great Watch,"This is a great high quality watch. It is heavy and well-built and looks great. Nothing cheap at all about the look and feel of this watch. Mine has the white background with gold hands. The hands are luminescent and easy to read at night but the small print of the smaller dials can be hard to read in bright light, especially for someone over forty. Overall this is an excellent watch that I've worn for 3 months now. If you are concerned about reading the small dials in bright light, consider a version with a darker background, such as black."
5,"Great watch, good looking time piece.","Works great,looks nice,dont have to worry about the date when not in use,it goes idle when i dont use it,times itself when it feels movement."
1,master of none,"This book only contains superficial coverages of all topics. The writing on CORBA which occupies large part of the book is extremly poor. It is very obivious that the author(s) 1) do not understand the inner workings of CORBA 2) have no experience as far as using CORBA for production purpose. The code examples are also riddled with error which makes you wonder who wrote them, and has anyone tested them on a real machine? If you want to learn distributed computing, please look somewhere else."
2,Missed the excitement,"I normally love Christina Skye's books, especially when they are about Navy SEALS. However, this book can be summed up in one word - boring! It's extremely repetitive, right down to constantly telling the reader what the two main characters do for a living. We're reading the book, good chance we know from the beginning! I honestly couldn't finish it. I was so disappointed. I felt as though the publisher gave Christina a deadline and she just threw something together. In all fairness, I couldn't write even a bit of what she did, so I shouldn't complain. Stick with her previous novels and hope that the book featuring Izzy, if ever there is one, is as delightful as her books before Code Name: Nanny."
1,Point and Line to Plane review,"I got this book brand new and must say that it is poorly written and very hard to understand. This may be alright for individuals who are familiar with thier field, but if you are new to your field and just starting out I would not recommend this reading as it will only confuse you.They do not describe subjects clearly and the wording is very dry. Our school recieved many complaints about it and as a result they discontinued the use of this book in the class room."
5,Best book on basketball ever written ...,"This book is, in my opinion, the best book about basketball that I have ever read. A close second is Dick's book ""There's Only One Way to Win"". If you love basketball and aren't looking for the same old dull and dry drills, check out Dick's unique perspective on everything from fundamentals to your mental approach to the game. If you play or coach, this is a ""must-see""!"
1,The running time is a lie,"The running time is 41 minutes, not the 59 they claim. We're all used to be fibbed to when it comes to running time, but this is an outright lie."
2,Disappointed!,"I bought 3 videos for my kids 2 to 4, years old. Butu unfortunately this is not the original pingu. They supposely have improved the the filming and animation but actually they have complpetely lost the spirit and charm of the original pingu's."
2,Disappointed,"Because my hair is baby fine and long, my infestation was hard to manage. Lice combs I had didn't get the nits so I tried this hoping I could get a head of at least part of the problem. I received extensive electrical burns to my scalp from the comb going off so often. Generally, the pain is tolerable but when the comb keeps going off in the same spots, your electricuting the same spot over and over, it hurts!!! My hair snagged on it a lot! I had relentless static hair from the comb drying my hair out. Other people have said its best to use as a detecting device. A possible different way is to use the robi comb then switch to the regular lice comb. Keep repeating the switching."
5,Money well spent- detects and kills,This product works and is poison free. It kills both adult lice and newly born hatchlings. (I know this because I got a magnifying glass out to see what I was zapping.) Because you use it on dry hair it is also quick. This product screens for lice quickly giving other non-infested family members peace of mind. The Robi-Comb does not remove nits but it will kill them as soon as they hatch. Money well spent.
1,Used once... then broke,"Tried, used once, then broke exactly 1 use later. You're better off to use a flat iron and blow dry the child's hair every day for a week, and achieve better results. Product is crap. Don't waste your money."
2,a bit disappointing,"I bought the comb in March and it just stopped working for no good reason. I felt pretty good about the product until now, but after reading the reviews I do not think I will be getting a second one as a replacement."
1,Not for children,"Hey, c'mon. Whoever thought this book would be good for children is just saying that because it was illustrated by Sendak. I got it in a group of books from a sale and I have 2 kids ages 3 and 5. I am all for teaching about injustices and the plight of the homeless but it takes an adult with a masters degree to ""appreciate"" the message and illustrations here. Don't buy it for anyone under the age of 30."
5,No suprises,"It does what it says it will do. I am not sure if my milage increased, since I installed the filter the day I moved from MT to AZ. I do feel like the little V6 is a bit snappier than it was before. I get about 17.5 MPG with. This installed. That is around the city of Phoenix. Probably 50% freeway and 50% surface streets.I do like that I will not be buying a filter again for this vehicle."
5,K&N ARE THE BEST,"THESE GUYS GOT THIS OUT IN RECORD TIME ...K&N AIR FILTERS ARE ABOUT THE ONLY THING YOU CAN GET FOR NEW CARS AND IT TAKES BOUT 3 MINUTES TO PUT IN...THEY HELP YOUR ENGINE BREATH BETTER,INCREASES HP AND MILEAGE AND LAST LITERALLY FOREVER...AND ARE SMOG LEGAL AND WONT VOID WARRENTY...NICE PRICE ON THESE ALSO"
4,It was helpful.,"I think this a pretty good book.If you do all the things it tells you to do I think it can be pretty helpful.My DH was have terrible headaches and no one could figure out why. I came across a little story in this book about someone who was always on their cell phone and would hold it between their neck and shoulder. DH is on his work phone all day long and also does this. We got him a bluetooth and the headaches slowly went away!If it hadn't been for this book we would probably still be miserable!If your looking at this book, then your probably at your wits end, so I would say what else do you have to lose, it just might help you too!"
3,A chef's low carb book....,"It's always nice to find a good guide to something you are into and in this case, this book does offer some basic recipes for the low carber who maybe doesn't have a lot of experience cooking. I didn't find anything different in the way of unusual recipes as Mr Pryor is also on one of the low carb forums and offers lots of recipes and advice on converting recipes using low carb ingredients which I have found very helpful. I thought he would have a lot more innovative recipes in his book so I was a little disappointed.If you aren't a gung-ho cook you might like this compilation of recipes, they are simple and use ingredients that available in most stores."
3,Not the greatest,"This book seems to be a little outdated. I've read a number of racing instructional books in the past couple of years, and this book doesn't go into near enough detail. However, Mr. Johnson does go into some areas that others do not, like how expensive racing is!It was quick reading but I only recommend it to someone who is ""contemplating"" entering racing - not for the present racer."
2,Cheap Li'l Lawnmower...,"Housed in cheap plastic. Actually got some decent use out of it, spout difficult to clean, then it started falling apart. I think I paid around twenty bucks for it, wasn't a rip-off, but don't pay the forty they're asking now."
1,Don't waste your money!!,I purchased this item because of the powerful motor. I use a blender at least 2 times a day and wanted one that would last a long time. Everytime I tried to take the container off the base the bottom would fall out and the stuff would go everywhere. I tried several times and the end result every time was the same. This will be going into the trash!!
1,Absolute Junk. You can have mine for FREE!!,"Don't even think of buying this device unless you enjoy spending 15 minutes cleaning up after each use. The pitcher base detaches itself from the pitcher after about 5 seconds of blending making an ugly mess everywhere. After cleaning up that mess and screwing the base on tighter, it detaches itself after another 5 seconds...get the picture!Anything thicker than water won't pour through the spout, so that feature is completely worthless. You absolutely cannot walk away while turned on or it will vibrate itself off the counter and onto the floor. That is assuming that it doesn't self destruct and have parts and smoothie flying everwhere first.The only reason anyone would give this even a 1 star rating is that ZERO wasn't an option to choose from. You can have mine for FREE!!"
1,Sleek look - but don't even think about replacement parts,"Due to my own fault, I broke the plastic jug of my brand new smoothie bowl. This happened in September - it's now April, 7 months later and each time I've called Villaware to get a replacement jug I'm told by yet another sympathetic individual that they don't have it in stock and - worse - don't know when it will become available. I got a total of 6 uses out of what is now redundant machinery. It was quite noisy, but hey, it's a smoothie maker. They're *meant* to make a lot of noise. If I recall back 7 months, it did make nice smoothies, and looks kind of cool too with the brushed aluminium. It's just a shame that there's no way to get simple replacement parts. I'd recommend pretty much any reputable brand over this one. In my experience, most encourage you to continue to use their machinery by shipping replacement parts as quickly as possible."
1,"Loud, poorly made, waste of money, 1 star is too much","I don't normally review items, but this was such a waste of money I had to warn people. First of all, the cheap plastic container is not dishwasher safe...something that should be made clear on the box. When the motor is running, the plastic cannister vibrates, even when it is locked in correctly, this is REALLY loud. The spout leaked, and the smoothie itself was not mixed well at all. My cheap $15 blender from Wal-Mart was far superior to this piece of junk! This was my first and last Villaware product."
2,Derivative,"This book cribs from The Highlander in the way that the last volume of the series pulled from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. At least the rules of vampirism didn't change again. Actually, this third book is quite a bit better than the last, but not as good as the first. It started a little slow and I didn't like the heroine at all. In fact, all the characters seemed very changeable and as though they were acting only in ways that advanced the plot, not ways that would be motivated by their intrinsic natures. Also, one of the chapters seemed as though it was split in the middle and switched around.Other than that, though, the story was pretty entertaining, most of it set in Venice during Carnevale. Drake was able to really bring the celebration to life, and even teach a little Italian."
3,Worth the read but not the buy!,"This was my first Shannon Drake read and it was good but not great for a romance. There was raw tension threw out the book that was also heavy with mystery. It was hard to connect with the lead male for me because of all the secrets. The settings were fun, but there really was a lack of romance. If you are looking for slightly better reads from Shannon Drake also try:Wicked ****, Restless****, Beguiled ****, Emerald Embrace *****, The Pirate Bride ****"
2,Disappointing,"This is the first book of the series I have read. I had a difficult time following the plot because of the regressions back into the past. The reader was kept too much in the dark about the vampires. Maybe if I had read the preceding books, this one would have made more sense."
4,Half-and-Half,"I think that the Clara and Odette combo is great, but you can't buy them separately. Clara looks horrible in the individual one. I bought CLara when she looks like she does in the combo, and it's great, but now they've warped her. I love when her curls unwind and her hair is wavy. It's so pretty. It rocks my socks!"
4,"It's different, really.","...not just different, it's creative. I don't want to spoil anything, it might not float everyone's boat, but for an anime made in the 80's, it was pretty good animation. The characters are less cliche. Fairly original.The best parts about Dangaio were the mecha designs. SA WEET! I'd love to find me a copy. But a word of advice. Don't get the dubbed version. I'm not your typical anti-dub anime fan, that's not why I'm saying it. Some dubs are good, some are bad. The dub for Dangaio was terrible. It sounded like a girl with a brooklyn accent was yelling in three different voices."
5,Great birthday gift!,I happened to see this show on one night and thought it would be a good idea to buy the first season dvd set for my boyfriend's birthday. He's big into truck pulling and anything that goes along with diesel trucks and just vehicles in general. He LOVES Top Gear now! And his friends do too! For once I got him a great gift that he actually likes! :)
4,Coulotte slip,Excellent service from the seller. The slip itself is fine and as described in the advertsiement. Very satisfactory transaction.
4,Tussie Mussies: The Victorian Art of Expressing Yourself in the Language of Flowers,"Got this book to help plan our wedding and the flower arangements to choose the right flowers for the event. Wow, it has a lot of information and is great for making a statment in flowers. It gives you the Victorian meaning and the present day use of each flower a long with some history.Good choice."
3,Want the old formula back!,"This new formula is extremely hard to dissolve. It still has the same taste and probably the same nutrition, and I would give the old formula 5 stars. The new formula is pretty gross, as I have to drink with some balls of powder even after stirring it for a long time. I want the old formula back!"
5,Great product!,This has always been a great post work out help. Helps my muscles to not be sore the next day.
4,It does taste like tang!,"I used this for the first time yesterday after a p90x workout. Reading some of the other reviews, I was half expecting a miracle cure to no muscle soreness the next day. Unfortunately that's not the case. I will say, however, that I am much less sore than what I would have expected knowing how bad it was without taking anything. The stuff tastes pretty good - kind of like Tang, and with a blenderbottle and blenderball, it mixed pretty good with no graininess. The only bad part about the mixing was that the blenderbottle created a lot of foam at the top, which went away as it set, but kind of tasted gross on the first sip. Good product, totally recommend it if you're trying to avoid the super-sore muscles after a workout."
3,"Product good, but taste...","I like Endurox R4. I've tried a couple of flavors now. I've been happy so far, but the Fruit Punch is not good. I expected a sort of Gatorade taste, but instead it reminds me of Pepto-Bismol. I guess I'm going to have to choke down a tub of this stuff...ugh."
3,Carb to Protein ratio???,"Just noticing some of the comments havent tried the product yet, but correct me if im wrong, if the amount of carbs (complex carbs?)=52 and sugars (simple carb)=40, doesnt that make 92 total grams of carbs to 13 grams of protein, which is a 7:1 carb to protein ratio not 4:1???"
3,"Excellent product, but not HDCP compliant","I purchased the EXT-DVI-EDID to connect my LCD TV to my computer for Blu-Ray and HD-DVD playback.Unfortunately, this unit is NOT HDCP complaint. This means that if you are planning on watching High Definition content on the TV, Monitor, or projector connected through this device, you WILL NOT be able to.If you do not intend to view any HD video content using this devise, then it will work fine for you. But if you do intend to watch HD content, you will be disappointed.If you require HDCP compliance then look at the EXT-DVI-EDIDP (DVI connection) or EXT-HDMI-EDIDP (HDMI connection)"
2,Not really yoga?,"While this DVD has *some* yoga moves, her approach doesn't really seem yoga-oriented. Her coaching is inarticulate -- full of ""ums"" and unfinished sentences. Also, her little jokes are funny the first time, but not the 10th. I like parts of the workout, but wouldn't really call it ""yoga"" either in content or philosophy."
3,Can't take your eyes off the screen,"This yoga video was disappointing. The series and flow would be great for any intermediate to advanced power yoga student, but the instructor fails to offer prompts throughout the sun salutation series. So unless you have your eyes on the screen (which is difficult when you're in downward dog), the user can miss the visual cue to jump or step forward. This happens a frustrating amount. The only way it is workable is to simply give up on expecting to be told when to look up or jump forward and flow at your own pace. I would recommend a Baron Baptiste yoga DVD over this one because Baptiste keeps a steady flow of instructions even when his students are inverted, so you always know how long you'll be in a posture and when to prepare to move. I would definitely not recommend this video for anyone who is just starting out in power yoga; you'll just end up frustrated and possibly injured as you look up to determine what you should be doing."
4,All about toning,"I bought this dvd because in the last few months, I've been getting into yoga and pilates to supplement my running. With Jennifer Aniston's name attached to this instructor, I was definitely willing to try it out.I also read some favorable reviews.I've tried many, many yoga dvds and this one has a very strong emphasis on toning. I would have liked it to have a bit more in terms of stretching, but it's good and will definitely give you a workout. I prefer dvds that actually make me feel like I did some exerciseThe instructor, Mandy Ingber, talks you through the video, which is helpful. She says some funny things and makes the painful moments more bearable and fun.I would definitely recommend this workout.If you would like another recommendations, I'd go with Jillian Michael's Yoga Meltdown. I do these two dvds regularly and they def give me a workout! Another good one is the 15 minute workout with Mariel Hemingway and Rodney Yee. Skip the Denise Austin one. I wasn't impressed."
2,"Good workout, but definitely NOT yoga","Too many things to dislike in this video:1. too many references to her ""great ass"" and how great she looks2. too many crotch shots in too-short shorts (seriously, I do not need to SEE your Brazilian wax!)3. outdated 80's philosophy of ""feel of the burn""4. renames yoga poses to suit her (""This pose is called cat-cow, but I call it cat-dog"")5. thinks ""it's yoga as long as we stay connected to the breath"", with no explanation as to what ""staying connected to the breath"" really means (and, obviously, what yoga really means)6. condescending toward yoga (""They say this pose opens the heart, but, <smirking> I don't I know about that. Well, I guess I 'feel the love' <laughter> ""7. no instruction on entering/exiting poses, little to no cueing as to when to change poses/exercisesI could go on, but you get the picture.If you are looking for a workout video, go for it. If you are looking to enhance a yoga practice, forget it."
2,missing parts,"I was going to send it back, but called ATI and they sent out what I needed (free). Next time I'll buy direct."
4,"Use this, not that","Plackers are the best flossers out there, with a sturdy flossing thread and study frame design. They used to be a little better (and would have gotten five starts from me), when they were still made in the US, but manufacture has been moved to China with a slight decline in quality. Even with that move, they're still the best flossers out there. I have very tight teeth, and can usually use only one for my whome mouth. Other flossers require me to change out the thread or use a new one after a few teeth because they shred or bend or the thread becomes detached from the ends. I also haven't been able to find Plackers as frequently as I used to at CVS, RiteAid or other drug stores and often end up walking out empty handed when I look for them, so I'm glad I was able to find them online - I ordered 6 bags!"
2,disappointing!,"What a letdown... if you are waiting to see Frank the Master Musician & Guitar Master, better look elsewhere... this show gives you a drip and a drab... was fortunate to see a couple of these Holloween Concerts in the 70's and I can't believe how this show has been raved about... even the supporting players are not among Frank's better formations... and sorry Steve Vai fans, he adds nothing classic here... take Montana for example, where is the lead guitar solo?... Frank's solo on the studio album is blistering.....what happened?... someone showed me an interview with Frank where he openly stated that he hadn't played guitar for a couple of years... well, this was probably the pre-stages of that period... too bad... better off going back to earlier material when he still had the fire... in this DVD, ""the torture never stops."""
5,excelente,"excelente video, super satisfechos...increible...una de las mejoras compras 2012....la interpretacion musical de un genio...este video es un documento, especial y poderoso"
5,A wonderful guide,"Bud Harris has refined his writing style and gives us an entertaining and practical guide to using dreams and other techniques for inner work to achieve a more balanced and authentic life. The book includs experiences for Dr Harris'own personal journey, making it less theoretical and more accessible. I'd highly recommend it anyone who is interested in living a more authentic life less defined my the conventions of our modern and decidedly unbalanced culture."
3,HELLO HELLO ARE YOU OUT THERE?,"Haunted by Poe's vocals, I don't get why this wasn't embrace by the radio airplay....but anyway it's better, a guilty pleasure for underground taste...but...even though this album was certified GOLD by the RIAA(1/2 million copies).the words.""Angry Johny"" enchanted us with the message to an old lover, ""Hello"" are ouy out there?, somebody there in the after life?, ""That Day"" melancolic and driven, ""Trigger Happy Jack"" such a junkie song, delightful, ""Choking the Cherry"" rock rock!, ""Another World"" kind of retro, this album is delightful in many ways, but fails to reach an ecstasy with half the songs, while the others are impacable and masterpieces, such a must have album for anyone who likes alternative music."
2,what happened?,"i bought this cd for the 2 radio hits... ""hello"" and ""angry johnny"". unfortunatly, these were 2 of only 3 or 4 songs on the entire album that i liked. the songs near the end of the album had potential but eventually bored me, or she ruined them with a horrible line. don't buy this cd unless you've already heard it in its entirety."
3,Useful Parenting Techniques,"This volume is full of valuable suggestions for parenting generally and especially for dealing with children diagnosed with Reactive Attachment Disorder. All parents, and especially those with special-needs children who have been adopted into the family, could benefit from Nancy Thomas' large catalog of practical suggestions for dealing with various behaviors and attitudes.I have major reservations concerning her easy endorsement of what has been called in my work ""therapeutic holding"". It is a technique that can lead to further trauma in children who have been abused, and I suspect many who embrace the ""technique"" as being more interested in power over the child than therapy. Another weakness of the book is that it is not particularly well-written in a grammatical sense.However this book could be very useful for parents seeking answers. It is written in a conversational, approachable way quite different from many professional volumes, which is one of its virtues."
1,So depressing!!!,"I was very disappointed with this CD. As soon as I started to play it, it put me in a very low, depressed mood. I wanted some uplifting but meditative music for my massage room, and this was not it!! I sent it back and ordered Deuter - my favorite meditative composer."
4,Inspiring,"Julie Benz is a fantastic focus of a woman who overcomes more than a fair share of hardship. Her tactic of riding at night has always been a favorite of mine and tugged at my heartstrings. This movie was definitely made for horse lovers as almost every single shot is horses horses horses. Pointedly, there are a few horses that constantly appear, woven into the storyline to effectively become your friends as well. Regretfully there are some slow spots in the movie, however,anyone who has attempted showing in Dressage, from the first painful day of sitting in that saddle to that first ribbon will identify with this movie making it well worth their while."
3,DRUGS AGAIN !!!!!,"I don't supppose some people will ever get the idea that drugs will drag your down eventually. This writer discusses the dirt and BS that take place in Hollywood and the entertainment business; and she did quite well in the beginning with a pair of Oscars. But after ""too many lunches"" with booze, cocaine,and with whatever she could chew,smoke or snort, she sunk into the sordid world of failure and broken health. There's not much new in her autobiography about the Hollywood scene but she does use actual names, dates and events (like Margot Kidder,Goldie Hawn,Warren Beatty,Steven Spielberg, Kathleen Turner, etc.). The writing is in a ""diary"" style and will not make the cut for great literature - kind of a step above the gossip magazines."
5,a great beach read,"After reading all of the reviews to date, I must say that I read this book shortly after it came out and found it informative and amusing. Hollywood is a strange place. I am sure that Julia Phillips took some ""literary liscense"" in her telling of the tale, but no one could write a book as comprehensive as hers without some sort of feeling or meaning. It is worth a read, especially for anyone enamored with the L.A. film life!"
1,This depressing book uses quilts as a symbol of oppression,"A well-written but dreadfully depressing book on the subject of anorexia, not quilts. The quilt of the title is used by the author as a symbol of oppression, and the quilt is burned at the end of the book. Quilters beware! I found this book unrealistic as a depiction of quilts and quilting and suspect the author knows nothing about that subject. NOT reccommended for anyone under the age of 20. This is not a children's book."
2,GINO returns,"If you like the cartoon show, you'll like this. It's not outstanding animation and the story is as cliche as ever, but it's redeeming since Devlin's pet iguana actually does something here (other than bolting like a trapped rabbit.)"
5,A MUST READ FOR PUBLIC SPEAKERS,"This book is an easy read, with instant user friendly ideas. It has changed the way I do business. If you are looking to increase your exposer in the financial industry read this book."
4,Rock-N-Roll!,"Nothing really fancy here. Just good ol rock and roll, if your into that sort of thing. I am, and I think is a really good record. Henneman and crew are not breaking any new musical ground (even for back in it's day) here, it's not experimental, they aren't combining any influences that others haven't. But if you like rock and roll, this a good album."
1,The evil isn't where Sean thinks it is..,"I listen to the Sean Hannity show daily and usually I can only stand it for five to ten minutes. This book will no doubt be a endless ream of ""liberals"" (its all their fault and we the righteous conservatives have all the answers) Now you might ask why I listen to the Sean Hannity show for five to ten minutes a day? Well it follows the Thom Hartmann show and it is breathtaking to compare the intelligence and depth of the two shows-mind boggling really!!! I will read this book and indeed I will try to keep from expelling my stomach contents but I will read it.(I won't buy it for goodness sakes) I don't hate Mr Hannity but eventually the pendulum will swing to the other side and Thom Hartman's show will be on seven hundred radio stations and Hannity's will be on the internet. Cheers"
1,hannity,"the Irish Ape Man goes after everyone to the left of Rohm in this tour de force of idiocy.... The fool is on the radio calling for people to give it a positive review so I thought I should respond in kind. Sean Hannity, Deliver us from you and your demented followers.."
5,the truth hurts!!!!!,"This book is definitely another hit for my friend Sean Hannity! It is obvious that he has gotten under the skin of the wimpy, truth hating liberals and I love it!! Way to go, Sean. Keep the books coming!"
5,Truth that is insightfull!,"Hannity's points are clear and concise and accurate. The pages are filled with the insights and answers we need to hear and see in America. America has enemies and america isnt the enemy! This is a must read for all who truly want to understand the times we are living in and the dangers that threaten our way of living. If anyone doesnt understand the end results of the liberal answers and ways,just look at the inner cites. Sean is opening eyes and his book is a good sight full!"
1,An Observation...,"Hannity Says: ""Liberals are more Tolerant of Saddam than of President Bush...""Mr. Hannity, only someone that is ignorant would believe your accusation above. Hannity, please go back to school and at least get your GED before you write another book..."
1,Conservative claptrap at its best!,A typical book written about by a typical neo-conservative.Lots of words with no new meaningful substance.Lots of unsubstantiated statements by unknown sources.Leaves out the now substantiated lies by the Bush administration and many of the othe neo-conservatives referred to.
5,He did it again,He is the one of most entertaining writers ever. I still enjoy his last one and enjoyed this one even more. I He leaves no rock uncovered and no surface unscratched.
1,Ridiculous+Nonsense+Confusion= the RNC,"This is the worst book out there! I always knew you ultra-conservatives were off your rockers but this just seems to confirm it!!! Until Sean Hannity can compete with the likes of Al Franken; Molly Ivins; and Paul Krugman, he shouldn't be writing such filth as this. Those on the right make a profession out of ""running"" with the first story they hear. There is NEVER a sense of logic or a sense of doing the necessary RESEARCH to confirm or deny what was put forth. Sean does a good job in disseminating his personal points of view, but there are no facts to back any of it up. This should heve been an editorial not a non-fiction book! Wake-up all you people on the right!! Take some advice. Until you can be credible on the paper and on the airwaves, knowledgable liberals and independents will not take you seriously at all! If Sean can start doing the necessary research to back up his facts, I just may buy his next book. But then again, why even bother???????"
5,Home Run For Conservatives Everywhere!!!,"I received this book for my birthday as a gift. Needless to say, I couldn't put it down. Mr. Hannity is a Great American! I've never seen a more researched book, complete with footnotes, with so many facts. In fact, in order to counter college campus liberalism, this book should be used as a college textbook or at least required reading. Hannity is right, and puts it simply: There is an evil in this world that needs to be uprooted and destroyed. Like I said, I love the book and would recommend it to anybody. ""LET FREEDOM RING!"" is next."
1,A Horrible American,"Sean Hannity's false patriotism is a clear example of the major dangers facing America today. I remember very well what Nikita Kruschev said when he came to America many years ago "" you will be taken over from within"" I never forgot it. I seen it happening for many years and Sean Hannity is a perfect example of Kruscev's point. This is the worst book I've ever read. Let Freedom Ring is a horrible as well. These books should be a wake up call for America."
1,hannity's narrow optic,hannity and people like him are the primary reason why the usa is hated by many on the face of the earth. look carefully at his arguments and their one-sided supporting materials and you'll find the deficiency of any voices and perspectives of non-us peoples in general and of sufferers of the us military action in particular.
1,Loud and repetitive doesn't make it true.,"This book is much like Hannity in person: bellicose, shallow and full of ""facts"", that when you check them--aren't facts. Conservative political thought can be compelling and sensible, but Sean doesn't present anything here that either illuminates or educates. As I said, it is like his TV presence, rude, annoying and half true at best. Unless you just need a channel for your own life-pain and anger, and are willing to put your brain in nuetral while you read an angry man's nonsense, don't waste your money."
1,The Iraqi People Hate Bush for Destroying Iraq Civilization,You can see it with your own eyes. There are thousands of Marching Protesting Iraqi's that cannot believe that Bush would start an illegal war without planning for it's aftermath. Crime and rape is rampant throught Iraq because of Bush. We now have terrorists running around blowing up everyone - we never had that problem before Bush illegally invaded.My neighbor has a Ham radio and picks up Hannity - he reminds us of Hitler...
5,Sean is a Great American,Sean Hannity is a Great American and speaks for the majority of Americans. Keep up the good work Sean. We're with you.
2,It was fair.,"I have a friend who thinks that Hannity, his idealogy and his book are great. He took it upon himself to create a Acrobat file of the book (it must have taken a long time) so that he could print out copies and give it to friends. It was expensive, time consuming and a waste of time (in my opinion)."
5,FINALLY!!!,"Finally someone, in this case Sean Hannity, is able to cut through the liberal domination of the published world and drop some truth grenades on the battlefield of America. You say Liberalism I say Terrorism. In fact I can't tell the difference. It's the liberals who have declared jihad on the wombs of America's women. It is Liberals who strapped their [...] bombs to their bleeding hearts and blew up the church of marriage. And it is liberals who flew the plane into the second tower. I've heard one of the pilots was a 3rd cousin of Al Gore. Sean Hannity delivers us from evil...now if he could only get my pizza here on time."
1,....,"The logic and the concept of evil and good might please a god-fearing, sunday-school, brain washed child, but those who can think for themselves, deeply, outside a gospel will find the ""EVIL"" and ""GOOD"" debate appaling. Deliver us from idiocy, conformity, and paranoia."
1,more lies...,"typical of hannity, this is just one more pro-bush propaganda fest. don't waste your time with it. and, incidentally, I am not a 'liberal'. I am a patriot who is tired of seeing this country taken over by deception. Wake up America. Learn the truth. Read 9-11 descent into tyranny by alex jones instead of this garbage."
1,"Radio Show Is Funny, His Book Is Pathetic","In a nutshell, Sean Haniity is a self serving driveling idiot.His book is filled with the same old time worn gems as his radio show.1. Bill Clinton was incompetent2. If you don't blindly support President Bush and the Republicans then in effect you are helping terrorists.3. If you voice any opposition to the War On Terrorism, you are in effect ""Giving Aid And Comfort To THe Enemy""What an idiot!Save your money.....listen to this junk on the radio for free."
5,Sean Hannity Tells It Like It Is.,"Nationally syndicated talk show host Sean Hannity has opened our minds and opened our hearts here in my house in New Jersey. Sean's heart and soul are devoted to the quest of the truth. In the troubled times of in our land, Sean's analysis of indicates a lack of unity as a nation on the issue of defence of our country. Committment, courage and realism are just some words that describe the focus of his words. If you are interested in fact instead of rhetoric, in regards to the most important issues of our times, this book will strike up a truth in the raw. Superb job Sean !"
5,"Logic,Facts,and Common sense","People who live their lives based on logic facts and,above all,common sense,will love this book. Those who live their lives based on mindless,irrational left wing idealism will hate to see themselves in the mirror Sean holds up.I Loved The Book."
1,Read The Christ Conspiracy,"For a much better view of the cultural battle between good and evil, read The Christ Conspiracy by Acharya."
1,"When Hannity Has a Bad Day, He Kicks His Dog Snowball",I have an interest in reading Hannity's book because he lives next door. I started reading his book the other day and fell asleep after about 10 minutes and the next thing I know - I'm awoken by a screaming dog YELP! YELP! YELP! I live next door and I've got to tell you. Whenever he has a bad day at work he takes it out on his dog Snowball. By me knowing his dogs name proves that I'm legit. He also yells at poor little snowball and calls it a Terrorist Liberal and kicks the poor dog out in the rain. It's terrible...A plus to Hannity's book is that it has helped wean me off sleeping pills.
5,Very good book.,"This book reveals how bad, in general, American liberals have gotten with their extreme views and seemingly anti-American ways. He has a great and fresh new prospective on international affairs. With his solid thinking and articulate thoughts he can drive home the values that America had once had but has lost somewhere down the line. This book is ideal for young and old conservatives. It's even more important for liberals to read.As you can tell many of these whacko libs come out of the wood work and attack cons like Hannity on these boards to try to sway people from picking this book up. Don't let them sway you. Pick it up and judge for yourself."
1,A HORRIBLE PIECE OF WORTHLESS JUNK,"Why i tried to read this is beyond me.He is so up George Bush's ass with nothing to say.One sided arguments so easy to pierce..Fix your hair and stop writing horribly written inane books.I guess your dumb right wing Fox followers will love this crap.I don't get this guy at all.To me he is not smart, interesting or a good writer..I am glad he is one of the literary set of the right."
1,Sean who? -that peabrain from fox news,"I must admit that naving seen Sean Hannity on Fox news I never liked him. I actually found him to be very offensive. Sean Hannity is not an intellectual, as a matter of fact, other than ""freedom of speech"" and ppl liking his rhetoric after 11 September, Sean Hannity is no more qualified to run his mouth about this stuff than the guys that do data entry in my workplace. Not to insult them, but there not writing books on lofty subjects lik terrorism and international politics either! Oh well... ""let freedom ring... and idiocy prevail!"" -Thzt's the slogan right?"
5,Ouch - the truth hurts,Oh boy... the truth really hurts... don't you think you liberals? Thanks Sean! Great work! Keep it up no matter what these goofy liberals say about you.
5,A book you cannot put down!,"Sean Hannity weaves together many great quotes and recounts many facts from history to show that we ignore evil at our own peril. If you are going to read just one book on the effects of bad government policy, read this one. If you are concerned about foreign policy, read this book. If you care about freedom and justice, read this book."
1,Deliver us from Neocons,"We spend 1 trillion dollars a year on our military and are still not safe. May I recommend Blowback for a sane understanding of why the world hates usBlowback, Second Edition: The Costs and Consequences of American Empire"
1,Did people read or just skim their own preferences?,"I put one star, since I am still waiting on my book, although it looks like a lot of people go theirs. I'm not saying its awful or awfully good. I'm waiting to read it cover to cover, first. Judging by the number of one stars, five stars and whatnot, I think some folks just skimmed out there. I do not doubt some people who read this book are speed-readers, so hopefully I'll zip through mine. At least cite parts that are good or bad, when you review. To those who did that, no offense was meant."
4,Thought Provoking Book,"I found this book to be very interesting and thought provoking. It is a must read if you are a fan of Sean Hannity, or if (like me) you love politics.I agree with one reviewer that said so much dislike for Sean Hannity isn't healthy. I will never figure out why, to some, ""freedom of speech"" only applies to Michael Moore and Al Franken.Read all sides - make up your own mind - don't be a kool-aid drinker!"
2,Passion but no facts,"My recommendation for anyone who reads this is to get a passport and travel. Start reading news from Australia, the UK (and if you can speak a foreign language), Spain, France, Germany, Japan, etc. American news is biased. Forget right or left, but biased towards making America look good and putting band-aids on the fact that everything we've ever done in the world was not the best solution. And this goes for foreign policies under both Republican and Democratic presidents (Clinton was no saint either, see: Croatia). Broaden your horizons, read a paper or news source that isn't American and discover the truth isn't right or left, but usually somewhere in the middle. Therefore, I find it ironic that Hannity, although passionate and intentions well placed, just seems to be fanning the flames of ignorance that led to the situations that caused him to write this book in the first place."
5,The Greatest,"A very well written and incisive book from a great hero of mine. Hannity is so good at bashing liberals, he's made a comfortable living out of it. You have to admire anyone like that. He's only giving liberals a taste of their own medicine. Remember how they bashed Reagan, Bush1, and now Bush2? Now it's our turn to do the bashing and Hannity is making a whole lot of heads roll. More power to him! Even the picture of him on the book is great. Another great book from a great mind!"
1,"Update Your Book Hannity, Bush is US Economic Terrorist","Stocks tumble on job fears:Nasdaq erases gains for year; Dow loses 72; Three-week slide continues; Investors increasingly uneasy about economy...Bush, be a Patriot and resign for the good of the country - Please..."
1,Group Liberalism with Terrorism?,"Does Hannity cite any history of Liberal's commiting Terrorist Acts in his books? No, I didn't read any.You watch, as soon as Bush and the Hannity types are out of office is when the United States begins to recover economically and heal from the divisive wounds nutured by these Morons..."
2,Deliver us from Sean Hannity...,"Sean Hannity's ""Deliver us from Evil"" demonstrates that he fancies himself to be the next J. Lo of the Fox News Conservative Network, to the chagrin of Bill O'Reily. What will be next, the Sean Hannity movie? With broad strokes the author often manipulates facts and re-writes history to support his well known agenda and to pray on the weaknesses of his readers. Be cautioned, read this book only if you have a predilection to strong independent thought. However it is important that any person from the left or the right read the opposition's literature to more thoroughly understand their detractors. An educated national debate is a cornerstone of any democracy, and this is what I find so repugnant about the author. On ""Hannity and Colmes"" the so called journalist projects a unilateral view point, based on rhetoric and not on facts."
1,what about Communist China?,"Yes, Sean...why don't you complain about China? A brutal, violent dictatorship which is filled with slave labor camps, political prisoners and death squads for those who openly disagree with their dictator's iron rule.Remember Tiannamen Square, Sean? College students were murdered for speaking out against Chinese communism. Millions of people are forced to work in slave labor camps their entire lives. No freedom for those people.Of course---George Bush, Sr. has business dealings with Communist China. He visits there often. And the dictator of China was recently welcomed at the White House.Conservatives like yourself love to pick and choose which brutal dictatorship they will become angry over. All others--you ignore. Why don't you cry a few tears over the enslaved Chinese for a change? Why don't you speak out for them? Why don't they even matter to you?In your next book, devote a chapter to the suffering people of China."
5,Great Book,"I have to say Sean Hannity, a fellow Long Islander, has done it again. I haven't completed all of the book, but so far it is an excellent read. Most people don't like to read the truth. Fact is we face evil and the Liberal approach has left us vulnerable to attack.Great work Sean, I recommend the book highly!"
4,Everyone should read this book!,"I appreciated Sean's frankness and knowledge of our country's military history. I learned more from reading this book than I did in public school. I agree with Sean's concerns about our policy's in the past and future and believe as he does that we need a leader like George W. Bush to deliver us from evil. That evil is continuning to happen on a daily basis in all parts of the world as I am writing this review in this democratic free society.I am so blessed to be an American! Again, everyone should read this book!"
5,Way To Go Sean!! Keep Up The Great Work!!,Deliver Us From Evil is a well written and factual book. The Democrats just can't handle the truth. Sean tells it HOW IT IS! I had the pleasure of meeting Sean at a book signing in Atlanta this month. He is a sincere individual who truly cares about his country! I was also lucky to meet Ronald Young the same day. He was equally as nice! I have and will continue to recommend Sean's book. I loved reading it! Thanks for the great book. YOU ROCK!
1,Mundane,"People are obviously flooding this sit with 5 star reviews with the goal of maintaining a high rating for this book. I have actually read it (well I read the first 100 or so pages) and let me tell you this is just like watching Fox news with Hannity, except here Hannity doesn't have to waste any time bullying and lambasting his ""guests"" and go on and on with his ""pro american"" opinions. The truth of the matter (such as I see it) is that people like Hannity never make a buisness or a country great, they are just over inflated egos who want to be the center of attention. Thankyou Fox and all your likes for exploiting the likes of Hannity. Even if you are a ""not so intellectual"" conservative this book is at best mediocre. Just because you love America, need to remamber that men like Hannity are NOT what makes America a good place to live."
1,Defaming three-thousand fallen Americans,"The partisan hypocrisy Mr. Hannity peddles on every page of this book exposes the self-righteous conceit that pervades the far right in this country. His discussion of the tragedy of September 11th and its aftermath is soiled by his relentless pursuit of his ideological agenda. Mr. Hannity should be ashamed of his partisan exploitation of the horror and grief of 9/11. Based upon the content of this book, it is clear to any objective American that Mr. Hannity either posesses the critical thinking skills of a turnip, or he is willing to defame the memory of three-thousand fallen Americans by using 9/ll as a political weapon."
5,Reality for flaming liberals :(,"In reading Sean Hannity's well written, highly informative book, Deliver Us From Evil, I was thoroughly amazed. The book provides, despite what knee-pad liberals say, a wealth of truth and knowledge Mr. Hannity is gracious enough to share with the world. Upon reading it, one can easily see why the liberals cry afoul.I found the book to be right on the money, packed with truths from beginning to end; however,If I was a flaming left wing, welfare receiving, giving middle class money to baby machines who can't understand what condoms are for, crying over my gin and tonic, Sean Hannity interview refusing, ""Now you listen hear Sean,"" Candaian resident during war time, scared of my own shadow, Billary loving freak, I wouldn't like to hear the truth either!"
2,BORING! VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!,"As someone who for a long time considered himself a Hannity fan via watching Fox News' Hannity and Colmes, I was disappointed to find out he isn't much on his own. Sampling the radio show and purchasing the book (audio book), he comes off as being very subdued and not enthuised. 98% on the War on Terror, while other authors such as Bill O'Reilly and Michael Savage tackle a host of issues head on, is it's essential flaw. I wouldn't recommend it. Sorry Hannity and Hannity fans. :("
3,"Not a review of the book, More of Hannity Himself","I just want to say that I have heard his show and he appalls me. As a veteran of the US army, to hear his desire to commit our troops across the globe...when he never served. He disgusts me.Not to mention the fact that he won't let a dissenting voice on his program finish a sentence. And Mr. Hannity, if you're reading, feel free to contact me and I'll provide a few dozen examples, just from the past few months.This man is a demagogue, and he's dangerous. Buy his book if you like, but beware."
1,MEET THE ANTI-CHRIST - SEAN HANNITY,"Numskull fox news icon has released another misinformed book about the supposed travisties of liberalism and the so-called values of conservatism.Well let me just say this - do you know Mr. Hannity that we are making the world a more dangerous place place by waging a war in a very volitle area of the world? What kind of values do you have if you want to put the people in danger and actually increase the threat of terrorism (a threat that will always exist, no matter what we do). All I can say is you are as dumb as the fox news network and as dumb as the president - pretty darn dumb."
5,You morons didn't even read the book,"Notices that the review section states ""I have read this book and want to review it"" considering that most of the One star reviews came BEFORE the book even came out, it shows that most of those individuals are more interested in bashing Hannity and regurgitating their own political ideology. Read the damn book or don't post a ""review."" You show yourselves for what you really are, ignorant and decidedly so. Shame on you all.I give this book five stars, in part to offset all the morons with the one star reviews. I do realize that will not really offset it, because those that are so willing to write a politically biased negative review are those that have the biggest mouths."
1,Hate sells. Selling leads to money and money makes you rich,Hate sells. Sean Hannity knows that very well. That's the way he became a national talk show host. That's the way he got a primetime slot in Fox News Channel. So again he came up with another hate book. If the America followed Sean's philosophy - America would be no better place than Soviet - having a Gulag filled with American liberal citizens. But America is lot better place than that. That's why McCarthy dies drunk and Rush gets caught with illegal drugs.
1,A toilet rag at best,If you like your hate in a book form - than this is the perfect read for you. Get the words of Almighty God translated through Sean Hannity. Sean has heard from the Lord and has all the answers! Amen! Read the best seller that will help a Democrat get elected in 2004! Thank you Sean Hannity.
1,Defeating Liberalism?,"For everyone praising this book, I would just like to remind everyone what liberalism actually is:1. The state or quality of being liberal.2. A political theory founded on the natural goodness of humans and the autonomy of the individual and favoring civil and political liberties, government by law with the consent of the governed, and protection from arbitrary authority.3. Often Liberalism the tenets or policies of a Liberal party.4. An economic theory in favor of laissez-faire, the free market, and the gold standard.5. A 19th-century Protestant movement that favored free intellectual inquiry, stressed the ethical and humanitarian content of Christianity, and de-emphasized dogmatic theology.I'm glad to see that Sean Hannity thinks that America should defeat this evil thing people are calling liberalism.p.s. Sean Hannity sucks."
1,"If you bought it, return it.",I wish I could rate the book at zero stars or negative stars. The book is useless. Send it back.
1,Sean Insanity,"One of my problems with the book and with all those who use the term ""liberal"" (""libbie"" or ""lib"") is that they never attempt to define what liberalism is. If Sean Hannity hadn't been a college dropout and had the chance to read classical books on liberalism, he would have changed his views about liberalism and/or he would have enlightened us with his take on liberalism. Unfortunately, the Irish thug chose the easy way, creating a ""liberal"" strawman that can be easily attacked on his several (too many??) media appearances. Meanwhile, the dumb masses of America recite his new book as the gospel. Save your money and avoid this very shallow and irrelevant rant from this clown."
1,bad shoe,not made as good as they where when they where made in Brazil and the size runs bigger would have sent back but cost to much. will not buy anything without shipping paid both ways.
5,These books ain't all fiction - that's what makes them fun,"If you have read all of Cmdr Marcinko's books, and I have, you know that some of the 'asides' he gives in these books are true. Red Cell did do a security exercise where they simulated 'blowing up' Air Force One. Marcinko did lead a team of shooters into Libya where they waxed over 30 people in a terrorist camp. Now the main story, which in Red Cell is about the smuggling of nuclear material to Japanese Rightists by traitors in the U.S., (as far as I know), that's fiction.For those in the know, it's fun reading Marcinko's books and seeing where he's taken the real stuff and blended it in with the fiction. Of all his books, this is the one I still enjoy reading the most."
2,Smells Like Cigarette Smoke and Arrived Soiled!,"The book packaging arrived smelling like cigarette smoke. It smelled so bad I had to leave it in the garage. The book cover was soiled; looked like a dried liquid stain. Disappointing as this book was listed as ""New"" and I paid accordingly. I had to work at ridding the book and cover of the noxious cigarette smell."
5,"Clear, simple, and interesting","Although this book discusses the basics of Wall St, I still highly recommend it. It's so clear and easy to read. If you had any confusion about why Wall St works the way it does this book will give you the answers.Excellent book for Beginners or can be used as a Refresher."
1,It is not a romantic suspense!!!,"Dont buy this book, if you are looking forward to a genuine romantic suspense. I dont think the author has even an iota of what romance is as far as this book is concerned. People screwing around with others as if it is their sole work in life, coming up with lame excuses to justify them...God! And as an after thought to make the characters sound sympathetic, they are shown with a fake intent of undying love and care. Basically, romance books are supposed to make you feel good after reading them. This book in turn makes you question about do you really have relationships like this. I sincerely hope the author does not come up with more hare-brained ideas like this in the future."
3,Thorough but confusing.,"I find their main example of the Binomial option pricing, using starting $4, interest rate 1/4, u=2, d=1/2, with the risk neutral probablities p=q=1/2 unrealistic, confusing, and hard to see as a practical example. I had trouble relating this to a true example. The Binomial Option Pricing Model, found in PDF form at [...]is a much better explanation and excellent compliment to this book. It uses an actual $50 stock and $55 call option as an example, and prices it, showing how the up and down parameters are derived, and more realistic interest and risk probabilies."
4,Interesting Read,I found this book to be a very interesting and fun read. A very helpful introduction to binomimal models and basic stopping time principals. It also provides a great refresher to Martingale principals. If you are having trouble with Shreve's volume II then have a look at this book first.
1,Warning - you will feel inferior,"Now that I have your attention, I'd like to seriously warn you about expecting this book to be a cookbook you might use. It is a collection of marvelous presentations, but unless you have a full professional kitchen, a couple of sous-chefs hanging around, and are the kind of person who loves to spend a week preparing the basic ingredients for an upcoming meal, this book should be enjoyed as a wonderful commercial for the restuarant, and not as a cookbook. Every ""recipe"" is a full blown presentation (see other review listing); a base preparation, under the star presentation supported by a cast of at least two if not three co-stars. And if you try to just make one of the items, I'm afraid you'll end up feeling inferior that you didn't prepare the full meal deal.Lovely photographs, by the way.Get the book from the library, save your money to take a trip to SF and eat at the restaurant. That's what I should have done."
1,"Miami Vice Season Five ""let down""","Miami Vice Season FiveA Real ""rip off"" where was 'Sonny' & the rest of the crew??"
4,Thank you Bob & Gary!,"Not only did this book help me PASS on the first try, it was very entertaining as well as informative. Definitely more geared to real world implementation that strictly to getting through the exam. Really good strategic & business considerations. The review questions helped establish strong understanding of the fundamentals behind the material. For a really strong showing on the exam, add a good practice test. These guys know their stuff & show it."
3,from the pew,One of her finer releases. She has a unique quality to being able to fuse contemporary with traditional and Jazz. It is apparent she takes great time and effort to select songs that are suited for her vocals and style.
2,I find this Spatula to be Frustrating!,"I bought this Spatula from what the 1st reviewer had to say...But I don't find this to be such a great working Spatula.The reason why is:The long top half of the spatula is sooo soft, that when you put it into the jar/can to get everything out, it takes a few times, because the spatula keeps bending under/over at the top. I find this very frustrating.grrrrrThat is why I gave it a 2 star.The only good I find is:It eventually does work!But I have other Spatulas that do the same on the first try.I can't figure out why I would want to use this for getting out cake batter from the bowl if the end is so soft, or for anything else!!I only bought this Spatula to use for getting everything out of a can or Jar, I have not tryed it for anything else.If I find this works better for other uses, I will be back with more feedback.If I felt this was worth the postage to return it, I would."
2,Don't do it,"I like to scrape out jars & was looking to add to my silicone utensils. This was not the one to buy for many reasons. 1) it is a 2 piece unit - don't do it - only buy the ""all in 1 piece"" spatulas. 2) This tip of this spatula is WAY too pliable almost to the point of unuseable when using in jars, or anything else for that matter. I think I've used it twice & it just sits in the drawer. Shame of it is, I love the rest of my trudeaus. I had to buy another spatula set, some off-name brand from Amazon - it was 3 piece & red for $15 - to get a 1 piece useable jar scraper that I use all the time for not only jars but lots of ""little"" uses."
1,The French Bulldog : An Owner's Guide,"I only gave this book one star as this book seems geared strictly towards new dog owners. The Frenchie photos are cute, but not much info that I could use."
3,Good for the price,"I bought this wireless mic to work with my PylePro PWMA portable amplifier. Have been using it for about 2 monts (Imwish all Amazon reviews would indicate how long the reviewer had used themproduct!) This mic is worth the low price. CONS: It is not an stoutly made as more expensive, professional mics. The receiver antenna is fragile and needs to be handled with care. You need to keep a tiny screwdriver handy to tweak the receiver's frequency adjuster for best results. This unit seems highly susceptible to signal loss by outside broadcasts. PROS: when the receiver is correctly adjusted, the performance is good. The mic's sensitivity to voice is excellent, and it's rejection of ambient noise is very good. I love that I can use two mikes at the same time ( the other a wired mic). With a little more preparation than perhaps an expensive mic would require, this unit does the job adequately for my needs. I use it in a large classroom to address a group of 30 adult bible students."
2,Not To Be Taken Seriously,"If your planning on passing a history exam, bypass this book and pickup Birdsall Vault's ""Modern European History."" What Libbon did was take a serious historical topic and gum it up and whip it up into what amounts to a microwave meal. Yeah it'll fill you up with something, but you won't remember any of it later. If you're not historically inclined and want something light hearted to reat, then maybe Libbon is the ticket, if you can get past the middle school level writing he employs. Although I know many students in my classes who would benefit from this reading. Then again they are also the type to not pick up the required textbook. If your looking for the highlights, Libbon has it, but he won't answer the why? And remember ""why?"" is the most important question a historian (and a professor) will ask."
3,Cute but....,"This review is about the Ecru/black shoe. This shoe is really cute and looks even better in person. However, the heel height is really high and if you're not used to walking in heels over 4"" in height, then these won't work for you. Unfortunately, amazon does not list the height of the heel, but I figured they are over 4"" when I compared them to my other 4"" heels and they were higher. The strap is comfortable. The insole of the shoe is comfortable. Overall, good quality. Just not designed for walking....AT ALL! I should have made this a four for overall quality and aesthetics! It's a beautiful and beautifully made shoe."
2,"Cute shoe, but beware the stench","I love the looks of this shoe. It's not even bad to walk in. My problem? The darned shoes STINK HORRIBLY!!! It must be the fabric they are made of. That is the only explanation I have for the nasty, awful chemical stench of the shoes. Sadly, after letting them air out for--no joke--3 months, I gave them to Goodwill. I never even wore the darned things. I thought I got a bargain--instead, I just wasted my money. STAY AWAY FROM THESE SHOES!!"
1,Wrong Item Sent,"I ordered the Spiral Lift Knee Support and the wrong item was sent. The item sent was Futuro Spiral Lift Knee Support, Medium, 1 support (Pack of 3). If a product is not available it should be pulled from the website, not filled with a product that does not provide the anticipated support."
5,fantastic,"i love this show! smart, funny, great back and forth between the main characters. fantastic stories. i wish they were making a lot more!"
5,Galumphing great fun,"Just as good as the first series/season. Wrestles deftly with philosophical dilemmas, too. It presents, in a new way, the centuries-old question: ""Can you do terrible things to save innocent people?"" It points out our roots in Machiavelli, and even better, digs them up to question them."
3,Not the best of the series,"The series is fantastic overall, but this particular episode is uncharacteristically weak. As an update, the premise is interesting -- rife with possibilities, actually -- but the plot just meanders. At 90 minutes it's about 30 minutes longer than necessary. The actors and cinematography are terrific and make it worth watching, but don't judge the rest of the series by this episode."
3,Sherlock: Season Two,"3 Episodes. The first, Scandal in Belgravia, is excellent, 5 starsEpisodes 2 and 3 paled by comparison. There were some deaths throughout the series which were very puzzling to understand.And were not ever explained, even to the barest extent. I found that disappointing."
5,Gets better and better yet started as the best!,"I love this series! The individual stories are great and the ongoing story line throughout each episode is fantastic. The writers, Wow, job well done. The actors, perfect in and for their roles. The season finale, what a cliff hanger and yet so so fine. The only problem (that absolutely must be endured) is how long we have to wait for the next season. I'll just keep watching over and over what we have until then I guess! Ive become a big Sherlock Holmes fan thanks to this series, the movies, and now the TV show called Elementary too. All great in their own way. Can't get enough. Watch one while waiting for the other! Dear Sherlock, come back soon!"
5,Best Sherlock portrayal ever,"Both seasons were great! If you like Sherlock Holmes mysteries, and possibly even if you don't, you will love this short, well-done series. I doubted that these old stories could be ""modernized"" but oh yes, they could and were. The result was some entertaining detective work, believable characters, and heartfelt relationships."
5,Wonderfully developed,"Sherlock Season 2 is as stunning as season 1. I hope this series continues for a very, very long time."
5,Great,"I was very leery of this series because of the fact it takes place in the modern era. I love the Victorian era with the carriages, etc. I quickly got over that once I saw how great these 2 fellows portrayed their characters, I absolutely loved both series. I'm hoping there will be more to come."
3,Under par read,"I found this book to be a disappointment compared to ""My Spy"" and ""Code Name: Nanny."" I felt the plot was thin and disjointed, there was no meat to it as in previous reads. It was as if the author wrote it quickly without a lot of thought, just to get it published. This is not to say it wasn't enjoyable, but it lacked the suspense/mystery/unknown that I was expecting after reading her other books. I read it in one sitting, in about 2 hours, and found myself wondering why I finished it - except I was hoping something would happen before the end other than the obvious. Perhaps the next one will be higher caliber. One can hope!"
2,Meh,"Meh. Like Philip k Dick, but free is free for a reason. I'll judge by the next free short to come."
3,these lint free towels aren't lint free,"I washed them and then put them into service and found that they left behind small fibers after use. They are just 100% cotton towels, nothing fancy."
5,A book to enjoy.,"This book took me by surprise and I fell in love with it. It shows a young man tested in his faith. Oh how I feared for him. I wanted so badly to stop him from walking into danger, yet I could not. There were moments when I was on the edge of my seat. Would he survive long enough to marry the girl of his dreams? There was adventure, danger and victory. There was romance, humor and honor. There were times throughout the book when the power of God's love and the working of His Spirit gave me the goose bumps. The Blade brothers got up to some amazing antics. I laughed and at times, I cried. I wanted to reach the end to find out what happened, but when I got there, I didn't want it to stop. This book doesn't preach, yet it shows the importance of good Christian morals. I highly recommend it. It will carry you away on an amazing journey. This is the best book I have read in a long time and I can't wait until the next one comes out. When it does, I'll be buying."
2,This battery does not last long at all,"Ok, so the main reason I bought this battery was because at the time, this battery got great reviews. Did I get a bad one or were the other reviews fake? This battery dies after about 3 days WITHOUT even using the camera. when using the camera, this battery lasts an hour or two at best. Far, far, less than the original battery. I bought a spare battery to last long trips and in the end I'm going to have to get a different one. Oh well, I guess it was a risk I was willing to take (cheap battery, but good reviews, why not?)."
5,Great deal on a replacement battery,"So, the OEM battery in my Kodak V603 digital camera started dying. The OEM replacement batteries were pricey. Gave this battery a chance based on reviews. So far, it's been working great. The only thing potential buyers should note is that, compared to the OEM battery, this one fits a bit more snug in the V603 camera. Can't go wrong for the price."
1,BEWARE - Damages Wheels,"BEWARE OF THIS PRODUCT!!! The packaging notes that it is safe for all wheels, however they neglect to mention that there is a twisted wire that holds all of the bristles in place. If you are cleaning the inside of your wheels, the wire brush will make contact with the wheel and scratch them beyond repair. I now have a new BMW Z4 with 4 damaged wheels as a direct result of using this product. I have contacted their customer service department as well, but no response as of yet. I am assuming that they will be covering the replacement costs."
5,Not a Bootleg...Real Deal,If you can find one Buy It !Great OOP Document.Thank You Mick Ralphs...Long Overdue.
5,Excellent!,"Ordered for 2001 Frontier, perfect fit, bolts right up. Doesn't look exactly like the picture, it is actually nicer! Very impressed, especially for the price."
2,not as good as gerber,uh its kinda cute it comes with a few washes mine dident come with that foam book thingy and i dont like the smell the smell lingers and the case does not hold alot good for travel makes a good small diaper bag hold about 2 premie size diaper a travel size wipes a nursette type thing of formula and nipple and pacifier but thats bout it by gerber comes with more
2,Passport to Europe,"It would not load in blue-ray player, only on the computer! It is just plain JUNK!"
5,Must See!!!,Absolutely fabulous! Every human on the planet should watch this movie. Don't think twice about buying it. There is a reason you found this page.
1,"Good voice and technique, no soul in singing","Dhrupad is a very devotional music. I have heard recordings of some master singers and have been struck by the feelings they evoke. In this album, the artists have very good control over their voices but somehow there is no beauty or feeling in their singing. I wonder what is lacking in these artists that makes even a profound musical form seem shallow???"
5,great book,"this book is masterly written, with humour and enthusiasm.Very informative and a true pleasure to read. Everything you need to know about Mughal architecture if you are going to India.Better than any tour guide!"
2,Grade D+,"The cd starts out great, with an accustic version of HEAT OF THE MOMENT, but would not catch that heat again untill the last song THE SMILE HAS LEFT YOUR EYES. Alot of pre-Asia songs, and a few Asia songs. Boring delivery, tired playing, and a lame audience."
2,not what I expected,"I thought this was a durable steel metal mirror, but I am afraid if I drop this camping I might have 7 yrs bad luck. Ok for light camping but fragile fyi."
2,End Of A Great Band,"i just listened to the new so called spocks beard cd , dont waste your money on it to me they suck ! only decent song on it is the 3rd track to many ballads man they need neil back"
3,lorus seiko,"I bought this watch for my dad and to be honest I was impressed with the fast shipment, however the watch is gorgeous but the strap gets ugly on the inside while the outer part is fine. The face changing is very catchy and it looks and works good but dissappointed in the strap"
3,"Good music, cheap packaging",If you like liner notes this is not the cd for you. The liner notes are printed on a home printer and whoever is cutting them out is chopping off part of the notes. It comes in a slimline case so you can't read it from the side like you can a regular jewel case. The disc is a cd-r that looks like a fake.The music is good surf instrumental. If you don't care about packaging this cd is worth buying.
4,one great underground punk recording,"this is the newest of Hellnation's releases and is stayes very true to their style.Raw,agressive and always fast.With very political,hard-hitting lyrics all crammed into about a minute and a half blast-beat songs.Although, this in my opinion not their best album, but certainly above most otherbands in their genre. If you like very hard grind-core punk rock this should be in your collection!"
4,Honest,"It's honest, dispite the quasi-legal aspects of Mr. Boggs livelihood...the proof that the barter system still exists for intellectual property!"
1,Not my most favorite Potok novel,"I got this book on a recommendation from a book club list. My interest was even more sparked by the author. He is someone that I read as a teen and young adult. Davit's Harp is very hard for me to continue reading. Someone once told me that if you didn't like a book by the time you got to your age (as in pages), put the book away. I've read about double my age. I'm going to put this book away."
4,Short Life: 3 Years,"Mine is the Olympus U 700 All-Weather 7.1 Megapixels. I loved this camera and do not know what the normal lifespan of a camera like this is. It lasted 3 years. It just suddenly ""died"", the screen went blue with a few numbers on it. I've been told it could be the lense, in which case, it would cost around US$100 to have repaired."
3,Best Bang for Your Buck,"This camera does everything I would expect from a camera costing much more. It is easy to master and fits into a shirt pocket or small purse. I made a mistake buying too small a card. Don't but anything smaller than 1GB, the price for the larger card is insignificant seeing you will keep this camera numerous years."
1,Just don't use it outside,"This camera is compact and has many great features, but the LCD screen is so bright that it is impossible to take photos outside. I need to be able to take photos both inside and outside so I exchanged the camera for one with a view-finder. Bottom line, if you want to take photos outside this camera is useless."
4,Nice little camera,"Have had only for 3 months with no major problems so far. The only glitch is the lack of a view finder, so framing a shot in bright sunlight is not easy to do as you can't see the image in the LCD screen too clearly. Same as many other cameras of this type."
4,Moonlight Sonata?,"I want to purchased multiple copies of this CD for my piano students, but some of the titles on the CD do not match the listening sample. For example: The Moonlight Sonata is listed, but that's not what I'm hearing! Help me understand this before I purchased the CDs! Thanks."
5,Not Rosario's best but has its memorable moments.,"While not as good as his subsequent releases ""Infinito"", ""Otra Vez"" and ""Gracias Mundo"", this 1971 release does have its memorable moments on ""Sin Llave Y Sin Candado"", ""La Vida"", ""Corazon Herido"", ""La Muneca"" and Rosario's first big hit ""De Barrio Obrero A La Quince""."
4,Daniel's Gift,"Daniel's Gift was a beautiful story and was well written, for the most part. However, I found it to drag in places."
1,Nothing came thru except the title,I bought it for .99 and it never came to my kindle. only the title came thru. I really didn't know how to let anyone know so that it could be sent again.
1,Mad Skillz has no skills,"Absolutely the worst investment that I have ever made! I listen to rap when I party and really like all of it but skillz doesn't impress me! However,I did like the track that he made with Timbaland! If your into hip-hop check Tim's bio out"
3,sponge mop,Great service: received merchandise within a few days BUT sponge fell out of holder when I tried to use it and it was impossible to put it back in. Contacted merchant: they were OUT of replacement sponges for 10 days.That was nuts. Returned the mop and got my money back: fast turn around. Service is great product:NOT
3,#3,The player holds alot of room. I started to put movies on the sound is pretty good. The graphics slow up a little bit sometimes. I wish it was a little bit more portable. It's about time Archos came out with the games. When are the games going to come out? The gear for this player is expensive.
5,"""Best Samurai Manga Series Ever!""","The art is great and the story line is awsome, if you have any interest in the Bakumetsu period of ancient Japan; this the the mang a for you. I have read a lot of manga, and this series is definently in my top 5. I give a two thumbs up!"""
4,short but sweet,"This is a nice short story giving a background on to the war ageist the D'Haran's. Terry Goodkind gives you an escape into a mythical world of wizards, confessors and sorcerers."
1,Read it in LEGENDS instead,"Four stars for the story, one star for this printing. This is a good prequel to the Sword of Truth series, giving background information on Zedd. Don't bother buying it as a separate book, when you can get basically the same story in the LEGENDS collection of short stories. Plus, there's a short story by George R.R. Martin (A Song of Ice and Fire prequel) in the same book."
4,Debt of Bones,Nice short story that sets the stage of how and why the great barrier was set in place. Recommend reading it before the first novel in Sword of Truth series Wizards Firts Rule
3,Helpful Prequel,"Shame on me for my lack of attention to detail. I read this one AFTER I read the first one in the series. The good news is, it filled in some of the gaps from the first book. It's very short and it was easy to quickly go through it after I read book #1 but if I had it to do again, I think I would have had an easier time following Wizard's First Rule if I had read this first. This PRE-quel turned POST-quel for me, but was no less valuable for it."
1,Stephen Foster,"I saw a program on OPB about him so I got this. But, I didn't like it and don't listen to it. It is now under my bed collecting dust."
5,Great Drinking Music!,"This CD Kicks ...! BR>The trombone riff in ""Camptown Races"" is incredible. The screaming axe in ""Oh! Susanna"" is mind-blowing. The fantastic jamming on this CD reminds me of HMTT. This CD is one monster hit after another. ""Steal Away To Jesus"", is a real kicker, although not quite as good as ""Will You F'n Give Me Jesus"".......Just sit back, pop a cold one, maybe a whiskey shooter , pop thisbaby on the victrolla and enjoy.......Here's to ya Hawks..........."
4,The real deal,"OK, First thing first, this is a split CD with the bands GoGoGoAirheart, and Syncopation. Syncopation has members from Los Cincos, but they are definatly not the same. Syncopation is much more experimental, and their musical capabilities skyrocket in this project. I beleive that this is the only album that was ""realeased"" Yet they made a few bootlegs that they sold at their shows, that showcased their talent in a more fitting matter. If I had to compare them to other music, I would say a jazzier Captain Beefheart without the blues vocals, but that doesnt even do them justice. If you ever come by anything else they put out GET IT!!!"
2,difficult to read,"The book is difficult to read. Style and composition are poor.The author overuses formulas while lacking clear formulations.Don't recommend it for beginers and intermediates. While if you are in advanced category you may not need this book at all. Just to give you a reference point - I earned my PhD in physiscs/math. General conclusion: waste of trees, time and money. My sorry to the author for a bad review."
1,THIS IS NOT A MAKITA OEM BRAND BATTERY! IT'S A CHINESE KNOCK-OFF!,"JUST A HEADS UP PEOPLE! THIS IS NOT AN OEM MAKITA BRAND BATTERY. IT IS AN UNLABELED CHINESE KNOCK-OFF. I contacted the seller and they sent me an almost unintelligible email stating that this was somehow Amazons fault. That Amazon changed the wording on the item. I have no idea, but I'm sending it back.From the looks of the item, I can't even tell what drill it goes with. It's literally just a plain green battery with some type of serial number printed on the back. If you don't mind getting a generic battery (have no idea how well they actually work or how long they last) then have at it, but at least know you aren't getting the OEM Makita branded item pictured on this page."
1,Makita 193156-7 2.6 A-Hr Battery,The battery is a piece of junk. It lasted just under one year. No longer has any capacity. Will barely drill a 1/4 inch hole in a 3/4 inch board after a complete charge.
3,Missing more than the salt,"I love Amy's soups, and Amy's Split Pea soup may be my favorite canned soup. It was with this mindset that I plunged head-long into a twelve-pack of the ""low sodium"" version seen here. While it was still satisfying, it fell far short of the original (Amy's Organic Splt Pea Soup, Low Fat, 14.1 Ounces (Pack of 12)). I added some salt to try and make up the difference, but it wasn't enough. The texture was different, and the taste just wasn't the same. If reducing your salt intake is a high priority then have at, but if you're like me and just want to eat well AND enjoy your meals then go for the full-blown original."
3,"Good, but could be better","Well in my view anything Star Wars is just awsome. This is one of the first Audio Books I have listend to. I liked the story, but I always get confused because when seeing the movie you get used to the charecter voices so when you listin to this you can't get in tuned to it. You kinda can't put a picture in your mind. Well some people may like that but personally I don't. So listen to it if you are a major Star wars fan if not you may not like it."
2,Needs more current examples,"I had to buy this book for a course at AMU. This book was written in 1986. While there are principles that can be learned from books written pre 9/11, books written before 2001 about topics such as ""Crisis Management"" better have a lot of good material to justify being picked over a book that contains the lessons learned post 9/11. This book has good principles, but needs to be updated with post 9/11 examples/case studies. How am I supposed to take it seriously when it talks about Telex being used more frequently than e-mail? In it's time it was probably an awesome text. Now it's 26 years old."
1,Buzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"Looked great in the box, even came with 4 AA batteries, but when you plug it, it makes a very annoying buzzing noise. We did not use it at all. I am trying to return it, we'll see how much of a hassle it is. Do not buy this product."
5,The Bridges of Summer,"A thoughtful and sensitive book about the meeting of two cultures and eras. Zarah, a savey teenager from New York, learns about an entirely different way of life when she visits her grandmother on an island off of the coast of South Carolina. Ms. Seabrooke skillfully deals with the dilemma created when Zarah drops back into an era of old southern mentality. She is able to treat her characters with sensitivity and dignity while telling this story of learning to bridge the generations between Zarah and her grandmother."
4,Wonderful book !,It has been awhile since I read it but remember it fondly and still in awe of this amazing queen.
2,Author cops out in the end....,"J C Clarks review says it best, and demonstrates how some people want beef but refuse to view the end process where the animal is led to its death. I am not a hypocrite and readily admit I on occasion eat meat. But I also have helped cull meat animals since I also believe if you eat you should know what you eat and the beginning to end process. And what meat I do consume is raised in an organic and humane manner, which is also why I eat so little meat since organic and humane also can be more expensive. Sadly most meat animals raised for mass consumption are not."
3,"It is good, but...","Well, I am excited to hear this new material, but that is about as far as it goes. After the first listen, it pales in comparison to ""Trip"". I wish I could say that this is as good or even better than ""Trip"", but I just can't. Rowe still has a beautiful voice, and you CAN see the band moving in a different direction. Maybe they will have it down by the next album. For now, check out the songs ""Overdose"": it is simply gorgeous, and ""Real?"": a wonderful track. You should also check out their website: CauseandEffect.com. There is a completely re-recorded version of ""World is Ours"" which is FAR superior to the album version. It is worth the time to dowload and listen. Trust Me."
2,INNERMOST STATION FADES INTO OBLIVION OF BOREDOM.,"Before any Cause and Effect fan tears me down for this review, let me say I am one of their biggest fans, but their latest CD ""Innermost Station"" lacks creativity. The album just kind of fades away with each passing song. All the arrangements sound the same, and get you ready for night night. Their best CD by far ""Trip"" a five star wonder is the one to listen too. I don't think it is available anymore but it is a CD that definitely did not get its due from radio. If you are a true fan than buy ""Innermost Station"", but I really think you will find that it is just best as background music at a dinner party or sitting in the dentist' chair while getting your teeth cleaned."
5,It's The Church - It's Awesome,"This is a very fun album to listen to. My 5 yr old son recently got hooked on 'Yellow Submarine' and he loves listening to both versions of 'Its All Too Much', which is my favorite on this one, as well as 'Hiroshima..' and 'Friction'. Ive been a fan since their first album and this is a great addition to my CD collection. They make every song their own. Buy It, Request It, call your radio stations to PLAY IT!"
1,Totally displeased.,"I ran to the store to get this based on Amazon reviews. My skin is combination, prone to acne, and extremely resistant. I was told by my aesthtician that dermabrasion might be a good option. I tried this and it fell very flat on delivery. I've usedNeutrogena Advanced Solutions MicroDermabrasion Body Systemand St. Ives Apricot Scrub for Oily or Acne Prone Skin - 6 oz to much much better results. This didn't do a thing for my skin."
1,Not Worth It,i have acne scarring on my skin and thought this might even it out. Nope. It irritated my skin. Save your money and go get microdermabrasion by a professional.
1,Uh oh...,"I really loved this product. In fact, I have yet to find another scrub as good as this one. But, I just found out that Olay still tests their products on animals. I just think that there is no place for animal testing anymore. Imagine the pain the animals went through when this scrub was applied. So, I can't use this product, or ANY product from Olay until they change their policies. Too bad. Can anyone recommend a good scrub alternative?"
3,The product is okay,"I use several Olay products. With this one my skin feels soft right after application, but I don't notice a real difference in overall appearance."
4,smoother skin,I bought this because I had beeb very ill earlier this week and medication wrecked havoc with my skin. My forehead especially felt like sandpaper.I have used it three times and each time my skin is smoother and it lasts longer.
4,olay,My skin is definitely smoother following an application so I think the moisturizer works better. I have used this product 3 weeks with possibly some difference as far as smaller pores.
4,Very Good: My wife likes it better than I do...,"Hello Folks,I give my wife a facial with this combination twice a week. I follow what Rebecca Johnson had recommended: You moisten the face and slightly moisten the microderm crystals before applying to the face. But, I add another twist: I use Neutrogena's microdermabrasion battery operated applicator (has a vibrating head). After this, I put on the Olay peel.For my face, I find it best to use the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion kit. I apply the crystals and then use the Clarisonic Pro to ""grind"" it into my face. This gives me (a male) a better microdermabrasion experience/result.Regards,Marc"
1,BEWARE if sensitive,"I'm glad many are getting positive results, but I certainly have not. Had total faceoutbreak after 3 uses over a week and a half. Almost 2 weeks later my skin is still very rough and quite itchy at times. Had to return product."
4,Silky Smooth Skin,"I bought this having had really bad acne in high school and it burning off throughout college but leaving me with really red cheeks and blotchy red spots. I bought this and after using it for the last several weeks my skin has been softer than it ever has before. It's amazing how soft it is after just a few uses. My cheeks appear to have become slightly less red, but not entirely gone. I'm sure it will take a little while. My journey continues."
2,wasn't worth it,"I was hoping for more significant results with this. I used it consistently every week for 3 months, most of the time twice a week like it said, and didn't think it gave me any better results than a regular exfoliator. Didn't do much of anything for my acne, large pores, and blackheads. It wasn't worth the price to me, paid about $30 for it, I would of rather invested that money in buying a chemical peel."
5,Miracle In A Bottle!,My face has the tendency to break out so I make sure that I exfoliate real good at least once a week and this product is just plain awesome! It's having the benefits of a regular in-office microdermabrasion procedure but at a fraction of the cost! A set typically lasts for 2-3 months if used once a week. Be prepared to get compliments! I hope Olay does not discontinue them since they're really effective.
3,olay regenerist micro/peel,"It wasnt exactly what i thought i would be but a pretty good exfoliator..DO NOT scrub hard as you could possibly damage your skin..since i have adult acne prone skin, it did make me break out...but if it wasnt for the breakout i would have rated it higher...good luck to all who use this & ALWAYS be careful when i comes to your face.."
5,Smooth skin,"so far, i love the effects of this treatment: afterwards, my facial skin feels very smooth--even the next morning. i am noticing somewhat of an improvement in the fine lines, but won't know the final results until i've finished the entire jar. the thick orange gel smells great, & as previously noted, feels warm when you start rubbing it into your skin."
3,what cheaper means,this screen is good if you have seen the movie or you have played your game before... the resolution is not good enough...
3,"Solid, but ultimately disappointing despite her killer voice","I am one of those shadowy people who feels a shiver in the spine whenever Randy Crawford opens her mouth; even if she were ordering a cheeseburger or scolding her kids, I would probably want it in my CD collection. Having said this, I have my doubts about this album. There is too much pedestrian material here, and where the first track, 'Cajun Moon', is something special, there is little else of note in this collection of covers and rehashes. I longed for one of the songs to stretch her abilities and amazing sound, but of the rest, only 'Joy inside my tears' hold the interest. Please buy her 'Best of....' CD instead, though. Hers is truly the voice of the century - shame about the choice of material."
3,Freezes All the Time!,"This game looks really interesting and the bits and parts of it that I get to play are not too bad. The BAD thing is that the game FREEZES all the time! And it is NOT my computer. Every other game I have, all work fine. So I have had this game for 3 months and still can't get but about 1/4 of the way through without it freezing and me powering off my computer. Game play is fairly easy and the graphics are beautiful. Boy, would I like to finish playing this game."
1,Poor job of switching,"It is poorly constructed. I have to wiggle the HDMI cable that goes out of the switcher in order for it to function. The cable is fine, it's just that the switcher is flimsy."
3,"Great charger, OK transmitter","I have yet to find a FM Transmitter for my iPod that sounds good. BUT, this does work great as a charger and holder for my iPod. But I'm not completely sold on the sound. So far, the best sound I found is using the cassette adapter, which I know is quickly becoming obsolete."
2,I wasn't impressed,I live right outside of Seattle and have tried it on every station and it is always fuzzy sounding. It is a really great concept and I wish that it worked better but I wasn't impressed.
4,A chilling description of a government out of control,"When one hears the words ""white separatist,"" all the images of racism that have haunted our country over the years come rushing to the fore. After reading Alan Bock's even handed treatment about one white separatist's treatment at the hands of the federal government, your heart will go out to someone that, in any other context, might well repulse you and the horror of government abuses that he suffers will make you think we live in some third world dictatorship.This is a book that should be required reading. Every American needs to see government at its most extreme, trampling over the rights and lives of people who just wanted to be left alone. Although the Weaver family is seemingly completely unsympathetic as a group of white separatists, they ultimately come across as angelic compared to the law enforcement officers who appear to be guilty of manslaughter to say the least, if not first degree murder."
3,Good,I have to agree with the previous two posters. Tom has an excellent voice and has a great talent for writing very catchy pop. I wish he'd come back to the U.K. and start a project...although I do respect his right to make the music he is intrested in.
4,Good guide that has something for everyone,"I think there is no perfect guide book for everyone, but this does a pretty good job. Not just with popular visitor sights, hotels, and restaurants, but it has separate sections for shopping, galleries, entertainment, and kid's activities. I also liked that it goes into details about some of the more obscure museums. As a tour operator with Adventures Within Reach, I recommend this book for my clients visiting Cape Town and the surrounding areas."
4,A treasure for readers of Thomas More,"Sylvester's and Martz' 1969 facsimile edition of St. Thomas More's Prayerbook is a genuine find. It opens a unique window into the mind and spirituality of a remarkable man. The pages are crisply rendered in two colors, allowing readers a genuine feel for a sixteenth-century prayerbook. More important in this case, Thomas More's handwritten ""Goodly Meditation"" appears, line by line in the margins. The editors generously supply a full introduction and a modern English rendering of More's original meditation. The impact of the entire production is compelling: the reader can read a great saint's personal prayer -- in his own handwriting -- and read it as if over his shoulder in the Tower as he awaits execution. As an artifact, this book is a great testimony to the development of personal spirituality in the English Renaissance."
3,A cookbook,Great recipes but it is a cookbook. Regarding the celtic connections I think the book does not have enough information. Good read.
1,Expensive battery does not charge properly!,"This battery will not hold a charge! This must have been old inventory or something, but the vendor should be ashamed of selling a battery like this for $72!Outrageous -- and I didn't try to use the thing until about two weeks past the 30 day return period. Shame on me for not testing it on receipt, but WHAT A RIP-OFF!!!"
5,Good quality power pack,I purchased this as a higher capacity battery for my 6270 12v Cordless Drill (which comes with 1.3 Amp batteries as standard). This is a nice battery with heaps of life in it. I can go all day on driving tasks without running out of juice. Plenty of power and charges up quite quickly on the Makita pod charger.
2,Same Battery Pack Charger DC1414 May Not Be Used,Since my drill/driver and impact driver did not need replacing I just bought two new batteries Model 1234. I read the package and see that the charger DC1414 that I have used for the same batteries can no longer be used to charge the new battery pack. In the detail on the sales page tell people that so they either buy the charger or another drill kit. I thought that Makita was a better company that this.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought two of these replacement batteries for my cordless Makita drill thinking I was doing the environmentally resposible thing instead of going out and buying a completely new drill. The batteries came and they are absolute junk. After charging, I get at most 1-2 minutes of light use out of them. No, I am not exaggerating. In fact, they don't hold a charge any better than the used batteries that I was replacing. I wasted $100 on these worthless batteries. Unfortnately, I can't return them because 30 days has expired since I bought them. DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THESE BATTERIES. THEY ARE A WASTE! I expected more from Amazon."
4,"Great collection, but they missed one","An excellent compilation of the darker side of classical music, although I would have preferred a different rendition of Toccata and Fugue in D (New York Philharmonic perhaps), it's still quite good.But how could the series producer leave off Ravel's Pavane For a Dead Princess? It's preferable to Symphonie Fantastique - March to The Scaffold, plus Berlioz already makes an appearance with Dream of a Witches' Sabbath. If there was room, Verdi's Requiem would have been a nice addition too.So I have to go with 4 stars only."
4,Good CD,"I have listened to this CD a couple times and like it. It's good rock music, how can you go wrong?"
3,"Far from ""Lame"".","It's almost impossible for a new band not to get tossed into a specific genre when they arrive, and Seven Mary Three got stuck with the description of grunge. Of all the grunge bands, many seemed to lean towards other genres as well. Soundgarden was a bit metal, Nirvana was a bit punk, etc. The other side of Seven Mary Three is southern-rock. That's fine with me as I like some southern-rock, and it distanced the band from it's peers in that way. There's no doubt that the big hit here, and their biggest still, is ""Cumbersome"". But hey, it's a great song. Everything else here is short that hook, but it's good just the same. Some songs really rock, some are slower acoustic tracks, and others tread that middle ground. Chances are if you like and know ""Cumbersome"", the whole album will please. In fact any fan of anything close to grunge/southern-rock should dig this."
2,Demo Versions and Shareware,"It is important to note that this includes a few demo versions (severely limited) of real games, and a lot of shareware junk (think Atari 2600) to get to the 100 total. If your sure that is what you want, go ahead and buy it.Personally, I usually get more value out of a full released version of a game than a collection like this."
1,Awful Show,"This show is on it's way out. The first couple of seasons were really great, but this season was the worst ever. And Sookie being pregnant in real life, really didn't help matters.The storyline for season five and everything else about season 5 is just all inclusively no good."
3,Season 5,"Being a fan from the very beginning (and of the books) I wanted to love Season 5, but I barely tolerated it. I don't mind all the storylines, but sometimes it gets a bit ridiculous, sometimes boring. I will be buying this one, though, since I already own the other 4 seasons. I just wish they would bring it back to where it was in season 1."
5,Dont tell!!,OK I havent read the book but the end was kinda RUINED by one user on here! PLEASE dont TELL THE END OF THE BOOK!!!!! Keep in mind that people read reviews not only AFTER they read the book but before so they can get an idea of what others think! Thank you!
1,Well dang!,"I was going to read the book, but several folks on here have spoiled it by giving away the ending.Oh well....."
1,Very shoddy work and poor effort,"This book is page after page of only general information about forms of business; the sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, and limited liability corporation. Yet the book was advertised as a book dealing specifically with Kansas businesses. The Kansas information is less than a tenth of the book and seems only an afterthought.The author also doesn't seem to understand LLCs or how they are replacing the S Corporation.The information found in this book is information any serious entrepreneur would have already seen on the web. Today we expect a print source to contain special or value-added information for the price we are paying. I encourage the reader to first find all information you can on the web , as it will easily be more than is contained in this book."
4,rainbowfire,"It's a great reference for the Landmark, EST teachings. Highly recommend it for anyone learning to become a better listener and empower behaviors that help rather than hinder ones happiness."
3,Nothing spectacular,"Your lips will get a little more color to them, but I didn't notice any actual increase in size. The flushing did make them look a little fuller. So far the best plumper I have found is Lip Injection by Too Faced."
5,Withstanding the test of time,"Still one of the greatest albums of all time. It's only peers are ""Ready to Die"" and ""Life after Death"""
3,Sounds like an uncompleted demo on this album,"Junior M.A.F.I.A.'s first album from 1995 had a few good numbers, but most of this album is uneven. It sounds like it was recorded on a New York subway in Brooklyn and wasn't quite finished. The Get Money song has that '70s thing going on in it, as with most of the songs with the samples. Lil' Kim, Lil' Cease and Notorious B.I.G's parts are all good and were the best rappers in the group. It's smart that Kim branched out into a solo career a year later and has made 3 albums. The lyrics on money, cars, jewelry go into overkill on many of the songs. The remaining members say that they're making a new album. I hope it's better than this disjointed, uneven album that came and went in 6 months."
2,OK for what you can actually see,"When I first saw the cover box at Blockbuster I was in awe of Stephen Gill's picture. He's a very handsome man in a beefcake sort of way. The storyline and Stephen were sure to make this a good movie. Unfortunately, the movie has a very weak story, a cheap porn-like soundtrack, and is very dark. I think they forgot to hire a lighting crew. I wouldn't not recommend it, but I also wouldn't say you had to rush out and buy it. Lucky for me I rented it."
4,Original and Well-Researched,"With a format that reminds of Bram Stocker's milestone, The Gelwick Faxes is, to some extent, an updated version of the classic, as Jonathan Harker's sense of dread once again takes center stage, now in the form of journalist in the wrong (or right) place, Allan Gelwick.Though at first giving the impression of a screenplay, the payoff comes swiftly, heralded by the sense that you are really there during this hotel ballrom siege. As well, one of the terrorists, ""The Colonel,"" a female, has a thing or two to say about the DC culture.You know a writer has done something right when he expeditiously exctracts Stockholm Syndrome-like feelings from the male reader regarding said Colonel.In the end, we are left with a great thriller, and an interesting tour of Washington. Recommended."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"I do not believe this is real Wardley product. Amazon should investigate the source of this product and remove it from its website immediately. I have been feeding my goldfish with the same brand food (bought from Petco) for a few years, they had never had problems until I fed them with this food. They swallowed it and spit it out immediately. This product has a foul smell, which the same brand fish food that I bought from Petco does not have.A few suspicious things about this product:1. Foul smell.2. The actual package I received does not look like the one on the website. The picture on the website was one bag with 3.5oz, and another bottle with 3oz. The total weight is 6.8oz, but I received only one big 7oz bottle.3. The bottom of the bottle I received does not have an expiration date on it, while all other bottles that I bought from Petco have something like ""Best before ...""."
2,Some what informative,"I think this author is out there somewhere on most topics. However, I did find some informative info."
1,Need more info in product description,"The installation instructions require mounting to wall studs. I have a brick house so the hose reel is just sitting on a shelf. Too much trouble to return. This may very well be an outstanding hose reel but I have no way of knowing since I cannot use it. Yes, I can mount studs to my brick wall and then fasten the hose reel to them. But, if the hose reel is not satisfactory then I am stuck with holes in the brick wall and it is nearly impossible to fill in the holes with a matching color filler.This reel may not deserve a low rating so it would be better to ignore this post and rely on ones that actually use the reel. I only wrote this to explain the mounting problem that I have."
3,Suprise and not so much,"This record amazes i guess. Not the one for one to listen that easy if you're into a twins reunion desire for GLJ.It lacks the power pop formula of GLJ albums like Discover , House of Dools or more unknown and brilliant releases from the known collective who portraits the name. It ticks and is able to move very whell on tracks ""like Love lies Bleeding"" and ""give my regards to Ray "" ( decription well done from the Cure's "" a Forest""). Is vocal's are OK and haunting specialy on the first track.The band seems to lack inspiration a bit on the rest, worth listening to "" sorry"" and ""alive within"" though.Names sometimes create good expectations .. but to be fair and if you're a GLJ fan and this is not GLJ ( Michael's Edith Groove sounded more like it.) it's worth checking out."
5,dog toy,The Deedle Dude Mouse toy is really cute. My dog loves to carry it around and make the mouse sing. I definitely would recommend this to anyone who owns a dog.
3,Short...,"It was worth the price I paid, but was not exactly what I was looking for. It was very short and couldve been more informative."
5,"The Only Option for Fire Eaters. Fortunately, it's a Good One","This is a spectacular book. The price tag held me off on purchasing it for a few weeks while I tried to justify the 40 bucks or so on a book for a hobby, but once I received it, it was obvious why it's not the average Amazon paperback price, this thing is a text book. Not only is it about the size of my human anthropology book from college, but it's actually written in a readable way. If you are looking for a solid book on the topic, I have searched and this is really your only option; fortunately, it's a great option and worth every penny. Couldn't recommend it more highly."
5,Simply beautiful,"I agree that this is perhaps Aishwayra Rai's finest work (and I've seen most of them). Umrao Jaan's story is fascinating, uplifting, and heartbreaking all at the same time. The photoggraphy, costumes, and music are spectacular. The way the two stars express their character's love for each other, using nothing but their eyes, is sheer brilliance."
4,Just right...,We have a large square table that we love to play cards and board games on but some of our vertically challenged family members have a hard time reaching the center of the table. This makes it easy to rotate the game! We love it!
2,Broken and Disappointed,"I'm usually pretty pleased with Amazon, but they really dropped the ball on these staples. I ordered two sizes of Grex staples (twice) and both times the merchandise arrived in a jumbled broken, mess. In the time I lost, I could have easily made half a dozen trips to the local tool supplier to buy competitive products.These staple boxes are really light weight and break during shipping. Looks like someone drop kicked them across the warehouse... Come on, a few wraps with plastic-wrap packaging tape would solve this problem."
4,So cute!,"If you're looking for thick, plush and super-soft, this is not the set for you. However it is well-made and doesn't feel like sack-cloth, so it's definitely worth the price. The colors are bright and the pattern is adorable. We're using this for our two year old son, and it's a nice combination of trains, planes and trucks so you don't have to choose just one. Plus, it's not too ""cutesy"" or babyish, so he should be able to enjoy it for a couple of years. And since it's so colorful, there are a thousand different options as far as wall/carpet/shelving/curtain options."
5,Perfect fix for my furnace woes,"Had a problem with my ignition circuit on the house furnace. The flame would start/light and then kick out 10 seconds later. This probe uses the flame as an ionic path to let the ignition module know the flame has started and it can proceed with fueling the burners. The old one did not work and this was my first step to solving the issue.This piece did the trick, and we had heat instantly that night. Perfect product and seller"
1,Disc unsuitable for my area (Australia),I was unable to play this DVD as it is only playable in the US. Can I return it please
1,Don't expect a heart-warming film about redemption...this ain't that movie.,"To watch the trailer, one might be led to hope this film would be about decent people offering kindness to a young runaway girl in need of love, and, in doing so, finding redemption themselves.Nope.This is merely another situation viewed through the Hollywood glass darkly. Expect everyone in the film to be corrupt, amoral and irredeemable and you won't be disappointed. No surprise, really---this is Hollywood's reality---and apparently, the idealized reality of many viewers. I, for one, wish them luck in attaining it."
3,Adult level reference,"I was looking for a book for a 13 yr old who is just getting started in astronomy. I wanted to show how mythology and ancient beliefs came to be the basis for naming stars & constellations. This book does that but is far too involved for a beginner.Great for someone who can wade through lots and lots of references and complicated explanations. It is more like a college reference book with Latin, Greek, & Arabic names and definitions. Dover Publications, 555 pg. of small print, a reprint of an original printing of 1899.Would be interesting for someone with lots of time and patience or for students who need detailed information on the connections between astrology and astronomy."
4,For the Serious Astronomer,"This book is more of a reference book as opposed to ""The Dictionary of Modern Star Names"" which only covers 254 stars - ""Star Names"" is much more extensive and goes into much greater depth also covering many more stars. Not exactly a field guide but a reference text for the serious student of astronomy."
1,The book is empty!,"The whole book is just an introduction to the subject of the ""zone."" Someone that read the book will not learn anything other then there is something called the ""zone."" And also, I was amazed that there was no reference to Dr John Douillard's book: ""Body, mind and sport."" Although at the time I read Dr Douillard's book I thought it did have too many testimonies and not enough references to research works. Despite it, people interested in the ""zone"" (for example experiencing it) would be better off reading Dr Douillard's book."
5,Wonderful product!,"We purchased this bench for our daughter's U-11 girls soccer team. The first weekend we had the bench it rained during the game. The girls no longer had to sit on the wet ground! It was wonderful. Easy to set up, easy to tear down. Not too heavy to carry. Perfect! I would definitely recommend this product. In fact our lacrosse team moms have already asked if we are going to get another one for the spring!"
2,a review of the English translation,"This is basically an introduction to Ibn Arabi's philosophical position, written from a highly sympathetic (and yet thoroughly Muslim) point of view. It is recommended for those already familiar with Muslim philosophy in general, as it delves into some obscure areas of controversy whose usefulnesss for the general reader will be extremely limited. The editing of the English translation is quite poor."
2,Do not buy!,"Although this is a good idea to have..I dont believe it is accurate whatsoever.. you can breathe into it 5 times, and it will read you a different # every time.. handy but not accurate. Needless to say I am mad I wasted so much money on this product. Never again."
2,I'm a drinker...,"I'm a heavy drinker. I bought this unit based on it's reviews for it's accuracy. I'm disappointed. Granted all (I've done my research) commercial Breathalyzers I've researched seem to have their quirks- take a deep breath then blow slowly, don't inhale then blow normally, etc. I don't even know at this point if police breathalyzers can be considered legal, because they all, at least the commercial ones, seem to come down to these rules- you can't consume any alcohol, food, drink or cigarettes within 20 minutes of the test. Now, as I've said, I'm a heavy drinker, and I'm 43 years old, but I've never had a DUI, or any alchol related encounter with the police... but based on this weird 20 minute rule, I'm going to assume that the police can't even give you a breathalyzer test until 20 minutes after they've stopped you... does anyone know if this is what they do?"
4,Keeps me Safe,This product has done a great job keeping me safe. The digital reading is very reassuring. The only issues I have had is the waiting time before you take multiple readings. I do get concerned on the accuracy of the readings...but I am assuming that I just need to have it recalibrated.
3,The British Storyteller,"This book bears little resemblance to the usual ""spy"" or ""detective"" story. The book contains half a dozen tales linked only by the character Ashenden, who tells the story but seldom participates. As for spying you get only glimpses of the daily boring routine aspect of the trade. The individual stories each have their own interest. At least two of them are very good character sketches of rather strange people. The writing is always good.I'm a retired Russian historian. I bought the book because Maugham really was a British agent in Petrograd during the October Revolution. You do get an impression of the tension and the violence of the time but it could be any revolution anywhere."
5,Great for squirmy one-year-olds,"Our baby is so active and squirmy now that it's hard to coax him to sit still for books. This book is so entertaining that he cuddles in and pays attention. Every time we say ""One yellow..."" and then flip open the flap to say ""LION!"" he roars with laughter. A clever and well-illustrated book."
5,ANNIE BENEDICT ALBUM IS DELIGHTFUL,THIS ALBUM INSPIRES YOU TO BOW YOUR HEAD AND RAISE YOUR HANDS WITH A SONG IN YOUR HEART.JUST AWESOME
5,Battery Age?,"The price of the Makita 18 volt 2.6 amp battery is a great price, but, the age of the battery is my bigest concern. The last two digets of the serial # is the age of the Makita battery. I would insist on knowing the age of the battery befor placing the orders. How do I get this info. before ordering."
2,Very small book,"My fault for not looking at the dimensions of the book, but it was not clear at all that this was a mini book. I haven't gifted this yet to my son so we'll see if the story makes up for the size, but I would have looked for a different edition if I knew it was this small."
5,a classic for me and for my kids,"This is a book I thoroughly enjoyed as a child. I began to borrow it from the library for my own two boys and decided, finally, to order one from Amazon for my son's birthday. We returned the borrowed book to the library the day before his birthday and there were many tears. So, you can imagine my son's elation to open up his very own ""Little Engine That Could"" on his birthday. A fantastic book! There is also a newly released version with gorgeous illustrations. Check that one out as well. Great books are one of the greatest gifts you can give your children."
2,Should come with a magnifier,"I bought this book because the story is non-sexist unlike all other train stories (a little female engine who helps, for a change, a male character!). I thought having a tiny book about a tiny engine would be fun, but this book is so so small, it is impossible to read at bed time in dim light. When I hold it in my hand my son cannot see the pictures, and I hand the book to him, I cannot read the print. Also, I have never seen a children's book where the sentences continue over the next page. That makes reading very difficult and unpleasant."
2,Small size,"I bought this book because I remember loving it as a child. Yet, I'm really disappointed in the really really small size of the book. It is too small to keep my child's interest."
5,Must have book,I got this book as an imagination library book. It quickly became one of my son's favorite books. He likes the bright colors in the pictures and the fun story. The story is very good for teaching kids to help others and that they can do anything if they put their mind to it.
5,The Little Engine That Could Recieve 5 Stars!,"This book sure took me back to my diaper days. Toddlers will laugh themselves up the big steep hill as they read aloud this humorous yet deeply emotional story about finding your strength within. The Little Engine is an example to all kidkind to never give up, and think you can!"
4,Why don't you kill me?,"This CD features Beck's big hit ""Loser"", plus three previously unreleased songs from his early years. It's all typical Beck from the time period (not that there is such a thing as ""typical Beck""). Beck's fans should enjoy this CD."
1,"Everything is wrong with this ramp, buy something else.","First off, the title says ""Ramps"" and the description says ""SOLD IN PAIRS UNLESS NOTED"". It's says nothing about being a ""Single ramp"" or sold ""each"". You will only get one ramp. Also, it has a BIG warning label on it that says ""Don't exceed 1200lbs when used in pairs, 600lbs each(NOT 1000lbs! like in the description)"". Even the model number doesn't match, plus I didn't get any straps(description says ""Comes with straps""). The ramp came unboxed, warped, tongues are bent and the welds are horrible, even one of the rubber protectors was cracked on the end.This was the most disappointing order I have ever placed, avoid this ramp at all costs, it's not worth the price."
2,Save your $$: This is a rehash,"Maybe I missed it somewhere in the description of this CD, but every track on this CD is also on one of their other CDs. Since I already have ""Fandango Nights"" and ""Between the Waters,"" buying this CD was a big waste of money. I love their music, but not only is this CD just a re-hash of their other CDs, but on this one they've teamed up with some hack novel writer. This self-important writer makes sure you read the opening paragraphs to his novel by printing them on the back cover of the CD, printing them inside the liner notes, and (get this) doing a voiceover of the same hackneyed paragraphs over the first track on the CD. Sheesh. Willie & Lobo would have done better to get rid of this writer and put out a CD of new material (or at least make it clear that this CD is an anthology of previously released tracks). Summary: The music is great (as usual), but if you already have any of their other CDs, bypass this one."
5,Bring back this product!!!,"This is by far the best sunblock I have ever used. I surf and this sunscreen doesn't run in my eyes, I have not burned once (I have fare skin, and it can be applied right before I go in the water, no need to wait 15 minutes. Banana boat has stopped making this producted, which is a shame. I am hoping that they will bring it back. If there is any left on the planet I will buy it all."
1,Very disappointing!,"This book would definitely not be of much help at all to genealogists or other folks who just wanted to read a little about their ancestors. It is very narrow in historical information as it deals with only a very few townships. Very subjective in some parts, very technical in other parts, and very boring and uninformative for the most part. Would not recommend it at all."
2,Irish Canadian claptrap.,Some interesting studies of individual settlers but essentially its revisionist history with subjective facts only there to back up his argument. Don't waste your money!
5,"Awesome, The Best","Definitly a buy for moonies.The best songs are 'I Want Someone To Love' and the two japanese songs. Other great songs are 'The Power of Love', 'Daddy's Girl' and 'Nothing at All'. If your not a moonie then this isn't for you.The pictures in the cover are great and they give cool info on the japanese songs."
5,"Finally, a SM album that gets your pulse pounding!!!!!!!!!!!","A great Album, only 8 songs but they kick butt! A perfect mix of rap, pop music, comforting tunes, etc. It even has 2 original japanese songs. The quality of sound is excelent, tons of bass! I highly recommend this to anyone who has enjoyed the series or anyone who has yet to learn the joys of Sailor Moon!!!!!!!"
4,Great addition to any sailor moon collection!,"I really love the songs. They're high-energy and enjoyable, though they may seem corny if you're not a Sailor Moon fan. I only wish that I knew the episodes where each song appears. It's a cute CD, and I think ""The Power of Love"" and ""I Want Sombody to Love"" are wicked cool!"
5,Usagi-chan,"This is a very good CD! I know, it's the dub, but the Japanese is awesome, and alot of the English songs on this is/are awesome!"
4,WOW! [sugoi],"This CD is awesome! It's a definate must for any self-respecting SAILORMOON fan. Including 2 highly-addictive Japanese tunes, the song line-up is even better than ever! My favorite songs include: ""Moonlight Densetsu"", ""Ai no Senshi"", and ""The Power of Love""! In fact, this CD is so great, that my cousin Amber bought one for herself upon listening to mine!"
1,used creeper,I purchased this as a gift for my son and Im very disappointed it is used and has several scratches on this creeper... I would like some explanation as to why ?????
3,she likes,"Bought this for moms birth day, she says that it works good. But shes my mom so she could be just telling me that. I have not been over to see myself. O i have to write 20 words or more for this review. It is my first a last review i will do. sorry amazon do not have time for this"
4,Interference may be your problem,"I have this product and was having some of the same problems other reviewers are having. Search ""IR interfernce LCD TV"" and you will find many differnt solutions for some of these problems. It turns out that most LCD and Plasma TV's emit IR while their turned on. I share a Directv HR21 DVR between 2 TV's using an HDMI splitter. I turned off the power saving features on my Samsung 40 ""(LED) LCD TV and turned off the light sensor in my Sony XBR 5 52"". I also placed the receiving unit (with the antenna) behind my Sony TV and that solved all my problems. For weeks I thought the issue was sunlight until I reseached it further. Good lucK!"
1,Not functional,"Units did not work out of the box, even when placed right next to each other. Called the manufacturer for troubleshooting, and found they have not made this product for years. They said if it didn't work, it must be defective. I wouldn't recommend even trying to see if you got one that works. Returning immediately."
3,Good and Bad,"We purchased this so that we could hide our ugly Time Warner Cable box in the closet behind our TV. Very much liked the size and ease of use of this product. The only real big negative with it is that the range that it picks up our remote control at is very short. We need to be within 2 feet of the receiver or it does not pick up the signal from our remote. This is way too close and most of the time we find ourselves setting it on the couch next to us in order to not get frustrated that it won't work, which can be a hassle, but still better than having the box in the room."
1,Don't even bother to try it,"Very bad product in a nice setting. receiver has no receiving range, you will need to point right into it. It gets confused and so you need to feed is slow and many time it does not do the job. I'm looking to replace it. got on my nerves and I have better use of my time."
1,Erratic performance,"I loved the ease of installation and setup provided by this product. I also loved, in a bitter-sweet way, the fact that it was easy to remove again when it didn't work and I had to put it back in the box and return it to Amazon. Problem was that it did not work most of the time."
5,best thing i've ever bought,"I bought this 4 months ago and I'm IN LOVE! I have a mounted tv with all the components on the other side of the wall in the garage. I placed the emitter a couple feet away from the tv on a stand and the receiver directly behind the tv (on the other side of the wall). It works perfectly. They aren't that big at all, so it isn't too distracting. It works for my comcast/xfinity remote. Whoever created this was a genius!"
3,"good, but...","the plastic end caps won't stay on. that's all I have to say, but there is a word minimum required."
5,Works wonderfully!,"We love this little frother. It produces a lot of froth in just seconds. We've also found you don't need a frothing pitcher with this one, you can just froth your milk in the mug you're going to use, then add the coffee, and the froth floats to the top. Highly recommend it!"
5,A must read for every Australian and everyone else!,"A novel that provides a much needed Aboriginal perspective on Australian history - and does so with great originality, compassion and humour. I recommend it as a truly important and fascinating read. It provides a unique perspective on colonialism and indigenous resistance that is too often ignored by mainstream press and politics."
5,"Buy it, ALMOST all of that!","Used 6 months at the gym,(bike & bench) worked great, broke, replaced.Buy it NEW (about $45), get warranty & receipt. It breaks, Logitech will replace it with the NEW Freepulse ($98) but you didn't hear that from me. Now, the ALMOST is that it's not quite as loud as I'd like so I bought a $15 booster on ebay and bumped it up the rest of the way. Plus, 1 charge will easily get you through 3 workouts. This head bands is made of plastic but the new Freepulse headband is made of steel and it's lighter and stronger. The headphone freedom is priceless! Give all your corded headphones a kick in the pants and and roll wireless, baby!I love the Logitech headphones!!"
2,Poor rechargeable battery and constant signal loss,I purchased these for the obvious reason: Wireless headphone use so that music can be enjoyed without rousing the neighbors.I was disappointed.These headphones are great when they work. So why the poor (2/5 stars) review from me? The headphones do not hold a charge longer than about an hour before this incessant beeping will drive you insane. I felt somewhat like Pavlov's dog with the random ringing in my ears. The beeping indicated signal loss. After several recharge/retry rounds with these headphones I had to move on to something else.The problems with these headphones bar me from mentioning anything else about it. Just move on to something similar with better reviews.
3,Good concept.,really nice concept and worked great as long as you are very careful not to break them...the neck piece snaps very easily but no problems and sounds great.
2,Bluetooth Headphones,"Works well, but the headset is not well-designed; little flexibility and uncomfortable. The plastic is somewhat frail. Cheap; get what you paid for."
1,DO NOT BUY THESE!!!!!!!!!!,i purchased these about a week ago and the headband has already cracked. dont waste your money look at a different brand.
1,horrible dvd,I bought a 60 pack of these dvds last month. So far i've thrown away at least 30 of them. The ones that do work are very pixelated and choppy.
4,"Late but still great Stitt, however titled or packaged.","This must be the sixth different title and packaging I've seen for the same session--featuring Sonny with Jaws and Sweets at Bubba's in Fort Lauderdale. As for the music, it's fine late Stitt and characteristically heated Lockjaw. Sweets' presence is minimally felt. The ""local"" rhythm section is on fire the whole way, perhaps because they're players with world-class credentials. Few drummers swing as hard as Duffy Jackson; few piano players can match Eddie Higgins' chops and ideas. The sound is very ""present,"" capturing the ambience of live performance but also balancing the instruments tastefully.At the right price, this one is definitely a keeper, but make sure you don't already own it."
2,The angry tone and attitude of the book was a real turn off,"First let me say right off, it is very obvious that this is a self-published book; this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but Mr. Wright forgot to have an editor review it before it went to print. The book is riddled with grammatical, spelling, and formatting errors, which tells me he considers himself 'above' double checking his work.He sells the stuff is says is a 'cure' for HCV, but even in my newly diagnosed HCV state, and with my counter full of newly purchased herbs, I found his tirades and his 'magical' cures a bit hard to swallow. He just comes across as a used car salesman.That being said, he may very well be right on target with everything he claims, but the adolescent tone and the almost childishness of the writing makes it very difficult to believe. This book, while entertaining and informative, felt a lot more like a well crafted wallet probe than anything else."
5,I Will This Trip With Lloyd,"While Lloyd Wright's book is obviously written by a male (because he is one) and includes some ""side trips,"" Triumph Over Hepatitis C is an accessible story. And Lloyd's triumph over Hepatitis C is something that I want to identify with.After the first nine weeks on his program, my ALT dropped from 49 to 9. My viral load, which had been running consistently at approximately 1,500,000, dropped over half.I'll take the road trips with Lloyd. I'll take the male perspective. And I'll happily and gratefully take my new hep c scores along with it.Plus -- the only side effect I've encountered from using the holistic treatment Lloyd used -- a combination of glandular and immune system booster along with liver regenerators -- was an awesome amount of energy and vitality from the first week on.Melody Beattie, Author, ""Co-Dependent No More"""
2,That's my flippin' ride,"Rick (Ben Gourley) gets recruited into helping his boss' neice, free spirited Michelle (Mila Kunis), move from Georgia to Los Angeles. What?! Road trip! Rick is seeking approval from Mr. McAllister (Rutger Hauer) because he hopes to move up in his law firm. He rents a moving truck in Miami, and picks up Michelle along the way. The truck breaks down in the middle of nowhere, which happens to be where they find hitchhiker Orlie, played by Jon Heder, who, let's face it, should play Napoleon Dynamite in every movie he's in. They subsequently ditch Orlie, run out of gas, visit Rick's parent's, have the truck stolen by ""The Lady"" (Billy Drago), and get into a cage match death fight. Of course Rick falls for Michelle, and blah, blah, blah. There wasn't a single likeable character in this movie, which naturally made it difficult to enjoy."
4,"Bad clips, but works.","First of all, this talismoon window would be a whole lot better if the clips where stronger, unfortunately that is not the case as I got a few broken while trying to fit it on the cut plastic. But I do got to say that I was able to save most clips from braking off and fit it with no gaps. You can see the pics of my Gears of War theme. So take your time cutting and filing away the edges before you try to press on the window so that you dont break any clips."
5,let go of your cherished notions,"This is mainly in response to the reviewer who wrote that this book is ""esoteric drivel."" The reviewer's summation of the main ideas in the book is incorrect and if you know anything at all about Buddhism, you know it isn't about dogma. One of the many teachings of Buddhism says ""Live your life as an experiment. Don't take someone else's word about what the truth is. Find out for yourself."" That said, you can hardly go wrong with any book by Pema Chodron."
5,Great Heart Advice,"I found reading Chodron's ""When Things Fall Apart"" very helpful as I dealt with personal difficulties. It really is ""heart advice""."
3,Good Book for some people!,"This is a good book, My therapist recommended it to me, but it is too heavy and I don't think it is for deeply depressed people. I need to believe that there is something to hope for in all of this misery."
5,Growing up,"This is the fourth consecutive book I've read by Pema Chodron, but this one will have a special place in my heart since it helped me get through a very frightening and difficult experience. There's nothing trite or sugar-coated about this book ... it boldly challenges readers to lean into, instead of avoiding, the experiences that frighten us, and use painful feelings to wake up, grow up, and increase our compassion."
2,Muddled message. Look elsewhere.,"Muddled message. A few items of great interest, but those items are basic tenets of many belief systems and are given little new life here. Many rehashings of the same ideas. Would make a very nice 10 page book. Even then, there are better sources, regardless of what it is you may be looking for."
1,esoteric drivel,It is an indication that something is wrong if you have to go read another book or two on history and philosophy of Buddhism in order to understand the esoteric dogma she is talking about.Now to put all this in simple terms the jest of the book seams to be:We are all going to die and we should think about it all the time.There is no hope and we should not even tryAll is suffering and we should not try to do anything about itAll is pain and we should try to find more pain.We do not have a soul and if you think you do you are deludedThese are not good messages for someone who is really in a state of depression or fluxI can not see what anyone gets out of this bookHer point if there is one is almost un-understandable through all the esoteric drivel
4,DECENT INTRODUCTION,"It's clear to me that the sole purpose of this book is give a brief general introduction to 50 significant air disasters. In doing so, the author aborded only the surface of the problems, without entering into detaisl. THe book, of course, can't be compared to MacArthur Job's books, that goes deeply into the accidents with diagrams, sketches, deep aviation knowledge, etc. Mind you, guys: they are books written with different purposes."
2,Not real great.....,"I actually returned this DVD for a couple of reasons... First, the subtitles were almost unreadable, the production of the film wasn't that great either. Wasn't my taste in movies at all. SORRY!"
5,Get out your Rosary,"For anyone who knows and loves what John Edward does, you will also love this newest book of his. If you are not Catholic, this book will guide you to pray easily and do it in a practical way. If you are Catholic and haven't prayed the Rosary in a very long time, you will take it out of it's resting place and pray.John has always said his Faith frames what he does. None of his books demonstrate that more than this short but powerful one does."
5,Good Reading,"This is a good book, well worth the investment. I have already recommended this book to those I know who are also Lincoln or Civil War buffs. Other people reviewing this book may talk about what is and isn't in this book. I just advise you buy the book and read it."
4,"A deep, thought provoking read","If you plan on an easy read, don't get this book. Steers leads you into a vast array of events and characters surounding the assassination of Lincoln. If you are not totally dedicated to this book, you will not be able to follow it. If you are dedicated, you will enjoy it. Be careful not to get lost in all of the characters. They are all important to this work. I would recommend this book to any Civil War or Lincoln buff."
3,A bit disappointed but still a fantastic play.,"I love the play so I went to see this version when it was in theaters and enjoyed it. However, now that I have it in my own home, I remember some of the problems it had. There is a fine line between projecting your voice to be heard and shouting the lines, and unfortunately, a few of the cast members cross that. There are a few spots where the singing is off-key. And the acting is a tad awkward in several scenes. It really gives you the feeling that they just threw this together and there wasn't a lot of rehearsing. If you're a fan of the play then I would get it, seeing NPH, Stephen Colbert, and Jon Cryer in this is a real treat. But if you're new to the play I would not recommend this for your first viewing."
3,"Fantastic production, disappointing DVD","It's not the performance that draws the mediocre rating, but rather how sparse the DVD is in content. We should have seen this coming, as it seemed like getting this production onto a home version was akin to pulling teeth (initially, there were ""no plans"" to release this beyond its limited theatrical run), but they weren't kidding...it's just the production and nothing else. It's not like this is one single performance, too, as it ran for four performances, all recorded, I believe, and it shows in the final cut. You don't get to see any of the other footage, or post-run interviews, or rehearsal footage (and I think this is the most unfortunate omission, considering what it took to get this production to even run).While it's great this production is available, it seems like a missed opportunity. It needn't be ""Criterionesque,"" but this teeters on subway bootleg fare."
5,BEST VIDEO EVER,"I could not wait for this to be available for purchase, having seen the fathome event in a theatre. It will make you feel that you have front row theatre seats to this stellar cast. a must have for sondheim fans"
4,beaded shaw,"This shaw is pretty but smalller than it looks in the photo. I bought the Olive colored and the colors and beading are very nice.I feel it was an ""okay"" value. I will not return it but would not purchase it again."
5,Just like the ones from the Body Shop,"I too was using the ones from Body Shop, and was looking for substitutes after they discontinued them. I read reviews here, one saying that it's very similar and other saying that it's not. I took my chance and bought it. To me, it feels exactly the same.I used to buy several at a time from Body Shop. When I start using the new one after the previous one starts wearing off, I always thought ""Wow, was it this rough?"" Over the years, I must've gone through tens of them, and each time, I had the same reaction. So the roughness the other reviewers are talking about may be due to the fact that they've gotten used to the worn out one. The new one feels a little rough anyway. But that's just my take. I'm just glad I didn't have to resort to those horrible plastic ones that feel horrible on my skin or those mitten shaped pads that don't conform to my body contour."
4,Great senior book!,"My company has given out at least 500 of these books. We have senior citizen seminars and read a few excerpts from this book and give one away when attendees make an appointment with us. It is the ""light"" side of our seminar and we get so many questions on where to get this book - people love to use it as a gift! Some people tell us there are more than 1003 things and some tell us there isn't one good reason! However this book can lighten up even the cogiest old coot!! Love it!!"
3,100 minutes of just entertainment,"I suppose I would give this three and a half stars if that rating were available. This movie provided me with 100 minutes of entertainment. No deep thinking, no real surprises...just a romantic comedy about 3 couples who can't quite figure out what the heck they are doing or what they want. The acting was okay, especially the actress who played Abby. She was very good. It was not nearly as funny as I remember ""When Harry Met Sally"" being, but then again, these actors are not Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan!I would not rush out to get this DVD, but if it lands in your lap, watch it."
1,Are you kidding me?,"The front of the DVD says ""The Best Manhattan Love Story Since When Harry Met Sally"". So, I was expecting something fantastic. I couldn't make it past the first half hour. These two are such losers and to compare them to Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan is a joke. Ira & Abby are irritating, unsophisticated, and kind of dumb. I give it one star for being in New York."
5,THE BEST SPATULA-TURNER EVER!,"This an excellent product. I originally bought one to use as a non-stick fish turner (thin and angled as are the metal ones), to use on my non-stick fry pan when sauteing fish. I found I was using it for much, much more. I bought it in an upscale department store, but no more were to be had from that source. I was so happy to find it through Amazon. I will get yet more, to give as gifts. It is a high quality, extremely useful kitchen helper. Highly recommend to all cooks."
5,FINALLY,"Not one store in the Phoenix area carries this product !that just plain silly, I've asked Safeway, Fry's & Albertsonsall said they would...Still waiting for their call when it's inand I've mine for two weeks already."
2,Kundera in decline?,"After being consistently so very good in his earlier novels (peaking with Immortality)), Identity and Slowness have been quite disappointing. It's worth reading, it wasn't a poor novel by any means, but if you expect anything like the Kundera of old, lower your expectations a bit."
3,The Beginning is Strong,"Throughout this book the characters evolve. We continue to learn more about their difference in age, life experience, income and self image at an even pace. Based on characters, this has the potential of being a five star book.As to plot, the book has a strong start. The story of the letters, their mystery, their impact on Chantel and the timing and means of exposing their origin is well executed. Once the origin of the letters is exposed, the surreal takes over. While pieces of this part have well crafted dialog, the overall introduction and staging of this part of the plot does not meet standard set in the beginning of this short novel.This is the only Kundera book I've read. I wasn't totally satisfied, but will read another."
3,Provocative Identities...,"One of Milan Kudera's short stories where Chantal and Jean Marc really take their lives to a different dimension. Very provocative in many ways, Jean Marc tries in a strange way to make Chantal feel better about something that she complains about, that gesture by Jean Marc and its consequences puts both of them in very wierd situations. They both feel that new identities have just surfaced and they just keep experiencing one thing after another...Kundera's style forces your imagination to live the book more than you expect, just a great thinking process that leads you to that interesting end."
1,Hercules and the Pricess of troya /atlas in the land of the Cyclopes,"I, Think that Amazon.com,shouldn't sell, this kind of videos, your quality is the worst that I see in my life."
5,Gift for Grands,"I purchased this for my granddaughters for christmas. I read the entire series as a child and enjoyed them. It gave me a joy for and love of reading. I want them to feel that same enjoyment. So far, I think they would rather have had a video game."
5,Great classic reader.,"I bought this for my six-year-old daughter who reads on a fourth grade level. The Bobbsey Twins content is appropriate for her age, while still providing her with a read on her level. Her twin who reads on level is even trying to read it, and they both enjoy the story."
4,Reminders of a simpler time,"I bought this book for my granddaughters because I remembered reading them when I was in first grade. It brought back many memories but also demonstrated how times have changed. I am glad I can share them with my granddaughters while they are still innocent and can enjoy a well written, loving story."
1,It's about the pins!,"I can't get the pins to stay in! Occasionally, if you get it just right, the pins hold but otherwise they fire across the room like intercontinental missiles. I spend more time on my hands and knees looking for the dang blasted things than I do curling my hair. Am going to try the ""pro clips"" but am not hopeful as I have thin hair. Pretty lame of Conair as this has been a problem for some time."
3,Works a little too well...,"For me these curlers worked perfectly - I had them in for about 15 minutes, and the curl stayed in my past-shoulder-length-hair for the rest of the day. However, I would have preferred larger rollers. These made very tight curls in my hair - it looked like I was going to an 80s prom. Also, it would have helped to have maybe 2 or 3 more rollers to fit all of my hair. If you're looking for very tight curls, these curlers would work well for you."
2,Early Death,"I liked these curlers initially, and thought that they would be ideal for traveling, since the set is compact. However, after not too much use, two of the rollers are dead, and I will need to get another set."
2,Pretty Disappointing,"I've owned many hair curlers, and I was looking for one that offered large rollers and fast heat up. I was disappointed on both points. First, the ""large"" rollers are not large. They're medium. The smaller ones are really small. I plug it in before my shower, and even after showering and blow drying my hair, it's still not really heated up like it should. The only thing I can say that's positive about this product is the compact size of the unit and the number of rollers, which is nice. But if you're looking for large rollers (greater than a one inch diameter, and something that heats up really fast -- this one is NOT for you."
2,I forgot I even had these..,"I used these like 3 times.. they don't get very hot, they didn't curly my hair well (hair is a little past shoulders).. I stuck them under the sink and completely forgot that I was once excited about them. I'd go a different route in the future."
2,Not that great,"I've been using this book for about a year now and it's starting to drive me nuts. It has a lot of good information, but the authors write about it in such a roundabout way that it's exhausting to read. Many sentences are unnecessarily long and wordy. It feels like the author was trying to up the word count and just started adding in random adjectives to try to spice up the writing. I would never recommend this book to anyone. Not even close to being worth the price."
1,Stupid!,"This is the stupidest, fakest film I have ever seen. As a life-long hunter & outdoorsman, it was obvious to me that most of the hunting & shooting sequences in this film were phony. The animals were tied to trees and shot at close range. The supposed grande finale was the phoniest, the elephant Tembo being a baby elephant tied to a tree and shot while it is wailing & thrashing, with bad editing shots of a different grown elephant. These guys were also demonstrating the worse hunter traits & ethics by picking up & taking back to camp baby animals. That is absolutely not done by hunters! The only good part of this film is the hilarious sequence where Hill uses the native boy as bait to lure in & kill the crocodile. Other than that this film is a complete waste of money & time."
4,Great Low Impact Workout,"Great Low Impact Workout. Really gets you sweating and heart pumping. THe perfect mix of stretching, aerobics and strength to get you going for the day. I love the Workout."
5,excellent,"One of the best dvd i have spent my money on! you will sweat, great instructions not too hard to do"
2,"No Shane, No Pogues","This is a total disappointment for any Shane Macgowen fan. Spider is not in the same league. Drunk or sober,Shane made the Pogues.Lightweight is the only way to describe the music on this CD."
5,Great flask,Item is exactly as it appears in the picture. I was extremely happy with it. And the shipping was very quick!
2,Amazingly monotonous,"I bought this cd on a whim because I loved the song ""Push"" (and still do). The rest of the cd, however, is completely monotonous. It's like Hootie & the Blowfish only with LESS variety. And I didn't think that was possible."
5,What can I say...,The debut from America's greatest rock band. This should be on everyone's list of Best Rock Albums!
1,Where has the rock gone?,"It seems bands today have one reason to release their CDs. One reason: to make a large amount of money in a short period. Let's go back to the days when rock was packed full of quality music. You didn't have to look for it, it was on the radio. Now, Matchbox 20, Creed, Third Eye Blind, and Barenaked Ladies, among others, are spewing off music that they want everyone to like. One problem, most bands today have no originality. At the turn of every decade, rock seems to change. I will see the 90's as a decade that started off with a bang and ended with a fizzle. Lets hope this time the change happens once again."
1,A Hideous Piece of Trash,"I didn't buy this record. I listened to it for sheer amusement one time, and it is the most BORING, GENERIC, IMPASSIONATE GARBAGE IN EXISTENCE. Anyone over the age of 10 who buys this should be ashamed of themselves. That vocalist is the worst -- really, couldn't anyone sing like that? -- and the guitars are so dull they make Third Eye Blind look like Jimi Hendrix. And they're awful, too."
5,Great,1. Real world 5/52. Long day 5/53. 3 am 5/54. Push 10/55. Girl like that 4/56. Back 2 good 4/57. Damn 4/58. Argue 5/59. Kody 4/510. busted 5/511. Shame 5/512. Hang 5/5It's really great cd! Please tell me witch songs were singles?
5,Matchbox 20 an amazingly talented band!,"All the reviews seem to be ""I love them"" or ""I hate them."" I fall into the ""I love them!"" category. Matchbox 20 has is the best band i have ever heard...and I listen to a lot of different styles of music.Their songs are so personal and you really respond emotionally to each one. I haven't found any of them to be repetitive at all and I don't think they should be compared to such unoriginal bands as 3EB (whom i think suck!). They are not one of those bands who are around for one year and the next year everyone's saying ""Third Eye who!??""Rob Thomas has a beautiful voice that gives you shivers he's so talented. Every member is talented. The guitarists compliment the music wonderfully and the drummer rocks! (Of course being cute doesn't hurt lol) YOSLY is a definite must for any real CD collection. Even if you're really hardcore rock or country or whatever...Matchbox 20 accomodates you. THEY ROCK!!!! (on the Cd and live too!!they're amazing live)"
1,1/2 star for Alternative Johnny's alternative band,"Ten bands that are much better (please purchase NOW if you've been ""had"") (1) The Cure (2) The Divine Comedy (3) The Beatles (4) The Chameleons (5) Wire (6) Ivy (7) Fountains of Wayne (8) Mansun (9) Gorky's Zygotic Mynci (10) Television Personalities My work here is done. Good Luck!!!"
5,Buy this CD!!,There is honestly a song on this CD for every mood that you are in. It is nearly impossible to get sick of it!
3,ABSOLUELY HATE ROCK!,"Honestly, I am definitely a fan of hip-hop and rap, and to tell you the truth, I despise this type of music. But I do have to say that this album is pretty decent. I wouldn't go so far as to say that I love it, but it's alright. It's really great when you're in a funky, depressed mood. Nothing feels better than blarin ""Push""."
2,why did i buy this?,"no, seriously, why? did 'push' and itsangry lyrics captivate me? was it 'back 2 good', which drives me so crazy that i turn the radio off when it threatens to play it? was it 'real world' and its strange words... or did i just buy it for the heck of it? Because i'm pondering this question. one good song here, and for that, they get two stars-and, coincidently, it sums up how i feel about this cd.""Damn"" is its title."
1,one star was a gift,"If there was an option for no stars this would definatelly be the CD to use it for... childish riffs, childish percussion and lame lyrics- it's no wonder MB20 sold so many albums to the youth of America... if you fall in the category of ""I actually payed money for this album"" I ragret to inform you that there is no hope for you ever attaining any sort of respectable status amongst people that actually pay attention to what the hell they are listening to. If you are reading this and are insulted.... good, that is my intent. Band's like this make a mockery of real music and should be cast away and insulted, if you enjoy this album, good for you and please don't try and wrap your mind around real music because it will only confuse you and make you watch more TRL and listen to more top 40 radio, which will in turn keep you the hell away from my music!!"
5,CD'S SHOULD BE PRICED BASED ON VALUE,WHICH MEANS THIS ALBUM SHOULD COST ABOUT $25.OO AND THE LAST 10 I BOUGHT SHOULD HAVE COST $5.00 THE GOO GOO DOLLS $22.OO THE WALLFLOWERS $25.00 EVERCLEAR $15.00 (thats what i paid)worth it EVE 6 $2.00 AND SO ON.........IMAGINE RECORDS
3,it was good but the best,"the cd was pretty good it has a few songs that really suck like real world and a few others...the best songs on it are Busted, Push, and Damn. if you like the style that they sing then I think that this CD is for you becasue it keeps the same styel in almost every song...Busted is more like heavy metal...but I think that, that is the only one like that...."
4,A different twist to Alternative,I found the album to be interesting it seems like almost all the songs have been heard on the radio at least once or twice. It has a fast beat which is awesome for people to get out of a dull mood. The songs can go along with the different things people relate to throughout life and that is why it is such a success. Keep up the great work.
3,pretty good,"if you're one of those people who have this really strong prejudice against, like, pop/rock music, you probly shouldnt buy this cd. don't get me wrong, theyv got rock on this cd, but i just hate all the b!tchin on the reviews sayn that all this cd has is 'radio-friendly' pop songs. just because theyv got an easy-listening cd. this is a pretty good cd, but i only gave 3 stars cos i only pop the cd in once in a while cos i cant listen to it for lond periods of time. i still like the cd, and, of course, Rob Thomas' voice--which i think did wonders for that santana song. my faves on the cd are 'hang' and 'long day'."
4,"Like an uphill slope, you start well, but then you slow...","For an album by a band I had never heard of before, I was pretty impressed. However, I wasn't impressed for long. Yourself Or Someone Like You, is like many of the double CD compilations that I have - the first few tracks are really standout tracks, but then the rest let you down. I like ""3am"" and ""Push""; they really got to my mind, and started playing with the way I thought. The rest aren't exactly mindblowing. I could have given this album three-and-a-half stars, but I can't, and so as a sign of sympathy, I gave them three stars. But, it really isn't that good. If you like what I call Dawson's Creek songs (you know, songs that could go with the termination of a long-term relationship, just like many scenes in Dawson's Creek), then buy it. It may just not be worth it otherwise..."
5,"Amazing, Just Amazing","Even though this CD has been out for four years and I've loved it for four years, I still haven't gotten sick of it. I love the lyrics, the music, everything! Rob Thomas is just amazing, as are the rest of the band members.I really don't have a favorite song on the album, I love them all. But if I really had to choose a few, I'd choose Real World, 3 AM, Long Day, Push, and Hang. They all mix soulful lyrics with very good music.This CD is a must for all of those Third Eye Blind, Mad Season, and Dave Matthews fans, it's just the sort of thing you'd love to bits."
3,This C.D. could be better.,"Mactbox 20's C.D., Yourself or Someone Like You is a good C.D. However, it could be better in a few ways. Some of teh songs are great, while others are not. But, besides that it is a great C.D to have in your collection."
3,Matchbox 20 rules!,"I got this tape for Christmas, Ilove it, the songs are Excellent, Espically ""Real World"". My sister has The tape, and the Cd. I think that the songs and the lyrics are great. on October 3, I saw Matchbox 20 in concert, The lead singer, Rob thomas, Looked Awesome."
1,2 words- GOD AWFUL,"hooray for talentless one hit wonders, only redeming quality they have is that they're incredibly catchy (if you consider that redeming)"
1,"Great tools, lousy battery","Agree with reviews about poor battery performance - purchasing a third Ni-MH battery in three years. Light duty home use, stored indoors. I'm appalled Makita can't provide a battery to match the reputation of their tools."
1,Very disappointing.,"The two batteries I purchased in 2007 have delivered a very poor performance. One is totally out of order after 22 months and the other provides a very limited capacity. The 3 year warranty mentioned on the Amazon website is totally INCORRECT. When I contacted Makita for a warranty replacement I was informed that whilst the tools were warranted for 3 years, the batteries were only warranted for one year. No way near the quality of the batteries which were supplied with the cordless drill in the first place."
1,"Great drill, bad batteries","Unfortunately, these batteries seem to last less than a year. I store them in the house at a stable temperature and yet I can only get about 10-15 minutes of use and that's it... I have had many drills and these NiMH batteries have been a big disappointment. At $140 for two new batteries, it seems smarter to buy a new drill and battery type. Hope this helps."
1,Died just after 1 year,HII was given a nice Makita 14.4 volt drill for a gift several years ago.Over several years the original batterys died so I ordered one replacement thru AmazonThe battery arrived in July 2010 and now December 2011 the battery is useless.I have not used it that much but its out of warrant now.Thats money down the drain.
1,Very poor,"These batteries give out very quickly, and do not hold power. After a while, they will not even charge. This is not a reliable way to operate a tool. It is just too expensive to keep buying new batteries. The batteries are also quite heavy. I am back to using a chord: it is much better, and far cheaper. If I have no power, I will use a hand-cranked drill as a stop-gap measure: works fine."
1,Made in China battery died after 2 years of light usage.,"Purchased Makita cordless impact driver, cordless drill and flashlight. Original two batteries made in Japan died after 4 years of heavy duty usage. I liked impact driver so I purchased replacement Makita battery which was made in China. I was worried when I got the battery. Well, I was right about worrying. Japanese cells are much better than Chinese cells. The replacement Makita made in China battery lasted only 2 years of light duty usage. Lately, my impact driver lacked power when I charged the battery. Today my charger said that the battery is damaged.I am really upset that Makita charges over $60 and now $70 for low quality made in China battery.I purchased Upstart battery rated at 3.3Ah instead of Makita's 2.6Ah. I am big fan of Makita but battery does not measure up to Makita name."
4,A guide for those seeking career decision-making guidance.,"This is a book I use as an instructor but has many uses for the general reader as well. From making a decision and creating goals to resume how-to's, this is a helpful guide for those who may want a well-rounded view of career planning. What also makes this book ""well-rounded"" is its focus on theory. Very applicable for those who are going through a change of career or choosing a major in college."
5,Optically Outstanding,This product is really quite nice. I have had it for about a month now and I have yet to have any problems. It has also traveled very well. I have a dropped it once or twice and it still works great. And the color is really cute too!
4,Nice reference book!,"I needed this book for a computer class. We didn't use it in the class, but were required to buy it. I am glad I have it for reference."
4,stars in the sky,"My only reservation about this otherwise fabulous recording is that Peter Gallagher is a little too nice to play the role of Sky Masterson. While he has a beautiful singing voice, the charisma and mystery of Brando isn't quite there. Otherwise I thought all the singers were fabulous and an improvement certainly on the movie version, Nathan Lane is priceless as Nathan Detroit (move over Sinatra), Faith Prince is hysterical as Adelaide (ah-CHOOO!!), Josie de Guzman is a compelling Sarah, and the minor characters are superb as well, in fact Fugue for Tinhorns and the title number sung largely by the supporting men may be the two best numbers in the whole program. Great orchestral arrangements too, sharp, brassy, and tight, complementing the singing perfectly."
1,this book sucks,"anyone who is from montauk or the hamptons will this this book is lame. number one the photography is bad. number 2 this guy knows nothing about the area. He rented a house at ditch for 1 summer? big friggin deal. The only bright spot in the book is his choice of models, who he photographed badly."
3,Not as expected,"Although I generaly like Henckels products, this one doesn't do it for me. Unlike in the description, the real thing is made of aluminum. It is a small tenderizer, with a short handle. The product description said it was made out of steel, which implied enough heft to make up for it's diminutive size. In practice, the light weight, short and narrow handle (the grip itself is only about a half inch in diameter!) make it almost toy-like. Albeit a nicely finished toy, but not any better than the current crop of imports appearing at the local Walmart. I'll keep it, but I still have to find a real one."
4,Entertaining,"While the book is now many years old, it still reads well. It tells the fictional account of migrant expereinces in traposrt unionism in the mid-50s in the US mid-west.The writing is spritley, and the plots carries at a terrrific pace. The story is marked with plenty of political intrigue, family disputes, tension, and violence.A great read for a quiet afternoon."
5,It is not that bad-at all !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have listened to this cd quite alot. I love the requiem so much I bought the full score to it. I escpecially love movement 2, which in the beginning is very ominous, then moves to get very expressive and terrifying at tmes, the the last part fills me up with upmost joy."
2,Covers the wrong half of numerology,"This book purports to trace its teachings back to Pythagoras -- without ever mentioning that the present English alphabet didn't exist in his time period. This books extends for 432 pages without ever mentioning the Hebrew/Chaldean system of numerology, which in my experience has more validity and just, basically, WORKS."
5,"Infinitely surperior version of ""Night on Bald Mountain""","A superb disc throughout, yet the original version of ""Night on Bald Mountain"" is what sets it apart. After listening to this rarity I was shocked at the liberties Rimsky-Korsakov took in rewriting it to the more ""listener friendly"" version most of us are so familiar with. They're two completely different pieces; the original sounding almost as if it could be from the 20th century, while the altered piece retaining a definite romantic sound. I would venture to say that, in its original form, it may well have been inspiration for Stravinsky's ""The Rite Of Spring"".The other works are certainly worth a listening as well. Unfortunately, however, most of them are Rimsky-Korsakov versions. It would have been preferable to have all original pieces, but I'll take what I can get."
5,WOW! Thats a GREAT Bucket!,This bucket is SO cool. I was really exited when i bought this buckiet because it is so intense. Just LOOK at it! I really really love my bucket.
2,Frustratingly vague!!!,"This book is definitely a classic (in all senses of the word). What hobbyist still uses the Motorolla chips? There is little or no pseudocode (especially when an example would help). Even more troubling is that level of discussion is sometimes exceedingly simple (a transistor is. . . ) and sometimes way over the top (some of the subsumption and behavior based algorithms could have used a lot more discussion room).I found this book far too general to be useful. However, I will admit that it offers enough background to get you familiar with the words. This book needs a little more modernization (newer parts/processors/languages) to make it useful today.Worth reading (you can skip entire chapters of basic stuff at a time), especially if you know somebody who will loan you their copy. My recommendation though: buy it used and save the money, as it is not worth full price."
4,Scales,"these scales are great for weighing yourself each morning. I am on the HCg diet and they have worked perfect for me. The only thing, is that they are about 7 lbs off from those at the dr's office. so, if you go by your home scales, not those at the dr's office, you will be able to determine exactly how much weight loss you have. Would recommend to others."
3,Cute but not all that good,"Go Girl begins with a message from the author Trina Robbins talking about her desire to create a superhero book for girls. This idea seems almost quaint after several years of the manga boom. There are plenty of comics for girls, it's just that American publishers aren't making them.Robbins and artist Anne Timmons deliver some pretty standard superhero fare. Go Girl is the daughter of 70s heroine Go-Go Girl and inherited her mom's flying powers. She fights a series of mostly harmless criminals while dealing with snotty kids at her high school and hangs with her friends. The art is clean and clear, more like an Archie comic than a superhero book.They're fine, middle of the road comics aimed at grade school or middle school kids. They could just as easily be Spiderman or Superboy stories.They're not bad by any means but there's really nothing compelling to recommend them. Not when the manga boom has delivered much better comics with strong female leads."
1,IT IS USED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"While ordering this battery i was under the impression that it was new! After recieving the item at an immediate glance I realized that it is used. The battery has pen marks on it, as well as scratches. When I contacted the company to replace the item they instructed me to send it back and they would replace it. They also said that ALL of there items are new. When i checked the cost to return the item it is more then i paid for the darn battery. So I guess I am forced to keep it.Most people that need new batteries for there phones need them for a reason... they most certainly do not want to replace there existing used battery with a battery used by someone else.I would not recommend this company to anyone, and I will never buy anything from them again!!!!BL"
1,"If this were any more corny or flaky, I'd pour milk on it.","Obviously, Steel Pulse has long passed its peak. If you like amateurish pop reggae with cliched lyrics like ""I spy with my little eye"" and ""Say it loud, I'm black and proud,"" along with cheesy dance beats, then you may enjoy this tripe."
4,A concert Souvenir,"First of all you should be aware that this is NOT ""LEXICON OF LOVE"" which is the band's remarkable debut from 1982 (probably one of the best produced albums ever, and the songs are not bad either!)This is a LIVE recording of ABC's hits from the late 90s when lead singer Martin Fry put together a touring band (no other original members play on this album) to tour the EU and the US. Like many concerts the performance starts off a little unready but by about the mid point the band is wamred up and in rare form.The last few tracks showcase a top notch session band, Fry's still wonderful voice and the top notch songwriting of Fry and White.A must for fans, casual folks should stick to any one of the many best ofs or the poclet sized best of ""Lexicon of LOVE."""
2,PHOTO IS WRONG,"This does not include the decorative ring pictured. It may work for a 1/2-inch stub, but it has a large and clearly visible (except in the photos...) hole in the bottom for a set screw to secure it. Who thought that was a good idea?Was hunting for a solid and more substantial spout than what is offered individually in the local stores. It feels solid and substantial (thus 2 stars), but is fatally flawed. Had to return it."
5,Great Over-the-Counter Product,"Both of my dogs displayed the same symptoms. I didn't want to jump the gun and spend a fortune at the vet just so they could give me an over-the-counter medicine for them. I researched online, found this product that described exactly what my dogs were going through. Fast delivery and fast acting relief! Just like the package says, about 3 days and back to normal! I am keeping this product handy."
5,Works and cheapest place to find!,"This is the product you need to cure common types of parasites, it does have the special ingredient and this is the cheapest I've found it. Although this will not do anything against tapeworms and thats because this product is not made to cure them, it does not have the leading ingredient in it to do that."
5,Great product,"Whenever my dogs get parasites, I use this product. I""m happy to say I've only had to use it two times. :) It kills the parasites super fast."
4,Army Wives - Guilty Hobby,"The DVDs came well packaged and in good condition. The price is great for a whole season. I have a DVD player that plays disc from the US but this is something you would want to check if you too live outside the US. I got hooked on this show in season 1, and I enjoyed this season too."
3,One great song,"You should listen to all of the songs on this CD before purchasing it. There are only a couple that sound really nice, or that I have heard them perform before. If it's not a great price, only buy the ones you like..."
1,Savatage deserves the Credit! Wake up People!!!!,"With all due respect to all you people who loved TSO, I think you should wake up and go straight to the nearest CD store and buy Savatage albums and give it a listen because TSO=Savatage! and Basically the Christmas Eve/Sarajevo song is basically a song on the Dead winter dead album for Savatage! Even Back to a reason II is the same Back to a Reason song sung by Jon Oliva in Poets and Madmen album for SAVATAGE! So,, why does TSO get the credit and Savatage doesnt! Is this Fair!"
5,This is the FAMOUS Scott-Todd wplj christmas album.,"Yes this is it. That wild rock christmas tune that you want to find and can't is Christmas Eve 12/24. I drove people nuts trying to find this album and the group ""SAVATOGE"""
5,This'll get played a bit this xmas!,"Just got my copy today. Decided to pick this up after impulse-buying Beethoven's Last Night a little while ago.The song structures are truly wonderful, and even the concept of the album is uplifting and inspiring.If you want to deviate slightly from the standard musical fare of the holiday season, purchase this album."
2,for fans only,"This was my first purchase of the music from this group, and it will be my last. I was not happy at all with the music style and rendering."
1,Disappointing !!!!!!!,"If you are over 15 years old, this is not the Christmas music for you- I read some reviews here from children listing this very poor CD as THE BEST---Better than Mannheim Steamroller. Trust me, if you like Mannheim, you won't like this. (...)"
5,Primo up-beat Christmas music!!,"I love traditional Christmas music, and although only occasional glimpses of any old standards are heard, this album has become a tradition with me! I first heard Mannheim Steamroller's Christmas album, and marveled at how lively and energetic the music was. Then I heard this album by the Trans-Siberian Orchestra! Their music exudes unrestrained energy and exuberance! It was the one album I played over and over! Want to beat the winter doldrums? Listen to Christmas Eve Sarajevo!!!"
5,Fantastic!,"I first heard ""Christmas Eve/Sarajevo"" a couple years ago, and had to have this CD! It took me a while to find it, but it was well worth the wait. Yes, I have a couple favorites, but the whole CD is excellent."
3,???????,"This product finally made it to the person I had bought it for. It was to be used in a Christmas concert on Christmas eve. They got it Dec. 28th. Happy, NO i'm not happy."
3,CD,"My husband is enjoying the CD. However, when it came, the CD cover was broken in pieces. I had to find another cover to put the CD in."
5,Oh My God!,"If you need only one reason to buy this album, listen to Christmas Eve Sarajevo 12:24.Words alone cannot describe this album, you simply have to listen to it once and you'll understand."
1,"Obsolete software, unfortunately","The software won't install...Going on 8 years ago, my eldest daughter enjoyed the program and it helped her learn how to read. I just bought what I thought was the latest copy for my youngest and tried to load it to no avail. The software rev turns out to be dated from 1999, it claims to be compatible with 95, 98 and XP, but it won't load on my machine that has XP. Folks, don't bother buying it any more, unless you have a very old computer and want to risk it."
1,Does not work,"Purchased this hoping that it would help me make sure lenses is not inside out and also help insert. The lense is so small it does not see the numbers on the lense, you have to slide it around and its not designed well. The insert part dwarfs the lense and is way to big, what a waste of $17."
1,"dont try, not even think about it",this product is USELESS.I put on my contact on the BELIEVE ME YOU CAN NOT SEE ANY NUMBER.try to find out your own way how can understand contact inside/out.
3,The Key...,"Personally, I was looking for the late 70's version of ""Love comes Easy,"" and I was SEVERLY disappointed when I heard an updated version of the song on ""The Key."" Otherwise, a good effort! But, her original version of ""Love comes Easy"" was simply perfect...that's what I hope to get someday...Three stars!"
1,This machine can never be used outside USA.,"2 minutes after plugging this machine, the power supply got burnt. Unfortunately, I was told it shouldn't be used outside the states. It's amazing at the age and level of globalisation that Cuisinart is making product just for use in the states alone. This is total waste of my money. Worst of all, the customer care said I can't return it. Buyers outside USA please beware."
1,Only works at one speed after 3 months,"I purchased this mixer as a refurbished unit through woot.com and it was covered by a 90 day warrantee. I was thrilled with this mixer for the first few months I had it, and gave it much use during the holidays and in baking cookies and cupcakes for my son's birthday party. The warrantee expired Jan. 12; I made waffles the morning of Jan. 16 and found that the unit now works at only one speed. The dial to adjust the speed does nothing, and the motor works at only the lowest speed, making it useless in many applications. I contacted Customer Support and was told there was nothing that could be done as there is no grace period for refurbished units. I have had warrantees expire shortly before an appliance broke and had them honored in the past. I have been a loyal Cuisinart customer but this is the last item I will purchase from them."
2,Be Aware of The REAL Mixing Capacity,"I've had this mixer for about 2 years now, and the motor has held up decently, but the wires on the whisk have come loose and this is simply NOT a 7-quart mixer.I bought this because it was advertised as being a 7-quart but look VERY CAREFULLY at the photos. The actual beater sits at the bottom of the bowl (which is fine) but the shaft attachment also sits down in the bowl.The top 2-3 inches of the bowl are useless because of this. For food safety, the ingredients cannot rise above the top of the paddle or whisk because the shaft is not food safe. This means you can't mix more than 5 quarts in the bowl anyway.I bought this to replace my Kitchenaid, but I won't buy another Cuisinart because of this deception."
2,So so,"For general kitchen use the mixer appears to be alright, we had it for about 3 years now. We don't make bread nor do we use it every day but it gets used 3-5 times a week.The whisk attachment is total junk! The wires came out of it within first 2 months of having it, maybe got 6 uses out of the whisk. Replacement parts are expensive and not of good quality either. It is somewhat loud and pricy for the quality.I can't compare it to Kitchenaid ( I wish I could) but I wouldn't recommend Cuisanart standup mixer again."
2,lasts about 3 years,"I've had my SM-70 about 3 years now and the motor has burned out and the housing is also falling apart. I use it almost daily, baking all of the bread, pizza, bagels, etc. for a family of 4. It has lasted a little longer than the last 2 KitchenAids I owned, but not much. I think you get what you pay for and this is still a very inexpensive mixer compared to an Electrolux or a commercial brand like Hobart."
2,underwhelming,"I use this mixer primarily for kneading bread. The 1000 watt rating and large bowl imply that it can handle more dough than the large Kitchenaide, however anything more than 1800 grams (4 lbs) of dough just climbs too far up the dough hook (forcing you to frequently stop the machine and scrape it down). It also just wraps this amount of dough around the hook and spins it in the bowl. The bowl itself could handle twice the amount of dough."
3,Some good concepts but mostly misleading,"I followed the power factor training program for 3 months and noticed a large rise in my power factor and power index. When I went back to a full range motion workout, I was no stronger than I was 3 months ago. The measurement in terms of power factor and power index is something I like and still do. The concept of strong range partials however is misleading. Of course one can improve his or her power factor faster with partial lifts. I also did not like the fact that there was only 10 or so exercises in this book."
5,Sultry Sax Music,"For an evening with that special someone, this is the best cd to get you in the right mood. Enough said."
2,Okay,"This book has great content, but uses words and terms without defining making it very hard to follow."
2,A Terrible Disappointment,"Words escape me. I had really high expectations reading the other reviews of this book. I've read most of David's other work, and liked it. I also have to admit a secret fondness for science fiction written for the so-called juvenile audience. I really wanted to like this book, and I just didn't. The science part was up to par, but the story, the plot, and most of all, the chacters made my skin crawl. I will stipulate that this family probably exists in real life, but why write about it?"
2,Jumping of the planet,"This story by David Gerrold was set in the 21st century and our planet(earth) is way too crowded. The main character Charles Dingillian and his three brothers are offered a trip to the moon by their father.But he is actually kidnapping the boys from their BI-sexual mother. The way to travel is through ""the beanstalk"". The mixing of the life on the moon with earth causes a disaster. This science fiction is full of new and clear pictures of the technology in the future."
4,I Was Surprised,"to find this in the adult section of the library. Libraries and publishers love to pigeonhole books (among other things) to certain audiences and I am concerned that someone really screwed up :-) .... The author certainly meant to to make the parents unsympathetic and selfish but they aren't over the top evil. They are just like some of the divorced parents I know. They are blind, deaf and dumb to the suffering they cause. This book would allow some people to see themselves as their children see them, maybe."
4,Makes sense to m,"The book is easy to read, and the exercises really make you think. My ex and I are going through this book with our pastor to see if there's any hope of reconciling and so far it's helped us realize all the things we did wrong in our marriage and why. It's helping us to take the focus off who's to blame and refocusing on what's the right thing to do. We're about 2/3 of the way through the book so we haven't finished it yet, but I expect the rest of it will be as helpful as what we've already covered. I'd recommend this book for anyone considering a serious relationship, in the middle of a relationship, or trying to rebuild one. It does a good job of covering them all."
4,"Excellent scabbard, but a few flaws","I bought this for my Anduril and it is very nice.... but not perfect (at least not the one I have)I found really hard to get the sword in/out of the scabbard, it just gets to tight, but hey is just for display (or is it?).The plate on the middle of the scabbar wasn't well attached, just a few screws and a bad glue job, but I managed to fix it."
2,MODERATLY SATISFIED,"I PURCHASED THI PRODUCT AFTER I HAVE SEEN A REVIEW IN ALLURE MAGAZINE , THAT CLAIMED THAT IT DOES MIRACLES FOR YOUR ALLERGY INDUCED EYE PUFFINESS.THIS WAS MY CASE , SO I WENT FOR IT.WHILE I DOES MOISTURIZE THE UNDEREYE AREA , I DO NOT SEE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFRENCE IN THE PUFFINESS .SO IT DID NOT WORK FOR ME LIKE THOUGHT IT WOULD, BUT REMEMBER EVEYONE IS DIFFRENT, AND IF YOU ARE LIKE ME , ALWAYS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT WOULD REDUCE THESE UGLY BAGS, THAN I SAY GO FOR IT!IT MIGHT WORK FOR YOU."
1,Save your money,"This product made no difference whatsoever in bags under my eyes. It was expensive, and I feel I should get my money back. I think there was a guarantee noted in the catolog I got it from but can't find it. There is no way to return it after purchase according to the material received with it."
2,Sorry...Not a Stolzman Fan,"I've played the clarinet for 15 years and also teaches music professionally and I have to warn you I am one of those nerds that will read the sheet music while listening...well I can tell you, NO ONE COMPARES TO STANLEY DRUCKER. I hear and read so many mistakes with Stolzman and it almost sounds like he's faking or playing the wrong notes...which can be understandable with Corigliano's concerto (it's harder than anything I've played).I do have to admit that Stolzman plays with great character and you NEVER tell when he makes a mistake (Drucker is too much a perfectionist sometimes)."
5,Excellent!!,"You'll love this one! Not only does Jeff astound us with his music, he IS the music. I've had the pleasure of witnessing Jeff in action, live. This was my first encounter with ""Avenue Blue"" and in my opinion, they stole the show."
2,Reliability Issues,"Beware -- there are some very nice features with the eMac and OS X but there's some bad stuff too. I love iTunes and iDVD and have made some nifty gifts with these apps. However, OS X is so different from 9 that it's hard to adjust to. Also, my eMac that I bought little over a year ago broke last night and it's been difficult navigating through Apple Care (which of course I would highly recommend)."
5,Wow!!,"Just absolutely THeEE best cast iron there is!!! I have nothing bad to say about my Staub! My family is so happy that I got it, I'm a better cook for it and my husband is never so happy that he let me spend $80 in his life. :>)"
3,Staub 5 Quart Round Cocotte,Item is satisfactory it doesn't seem as heavy as LeCreuset and the edge around the pot is not consistent and becomes thin in places. I would not buy another Staub pot and will keep this one and appreciate the positive aspects of it.
4,George Does it Again,"Never before in the history of comedy, has a man been so right about the horrific habbits of Americans. His topics are thorough and his beliefs and observations are the truth and inspirire many thoughts. On this album, Mr. Carlin attacks anti-abortionists, guilty white liberals, and my favorite...the death penalty. The death penalty is perfectly acceptable and we need to enforce it to reduce our nation's violence-rate. if you want big laughs and great observations by the voice of multiple generations...pick this one up."
4,One of his best.,"This is one of my favorite Carlin performances. Very witty as usual. Good, high-paced humour that we've all grown to love from G.C. Not his best, but one of."
1,This is NOT a cookbook for vegans!!!,"I am very disappointed in this book. As a vegan who does not use ANY animal products (milk, butter, eggs, meat, fish, poultry, etc.), I was lured by the idea of a ""dairy-free"" dessert cookbook. When I received it and looked through it, I was astounded to note that almost every recipe calls for eggs!!! There is a note in the front of the book that EggBeaters may be substituted, but since they are animal-based, I don't use them - ever. This was a waste of my money."
4,Transports reader to a real and fantastic Cuba.,"The blending of the real with the fantastic is absolutery captivating. The erotic and mystical elements are used so well that the reader is transported to new and higher levels of consciousness. This work by Daina Chaviano is truly a ""trip."" The book is a ""must read"" for all interested in a better understanding of the Cuban experience."
2,too expensive,I bought this gum because I recently quit smoking and when I got it I realized that I paid over 12 dollars for gum that should of only cost me 5 dollars. what a rip off. however the gum arrived in a timely manner which was convenient for me.
3,for diehards only,This dvd is from the Pump tour in Philly and not the Permanent Vacation tour as the title might lead one to think. It is pro shot with multiple camera's and the sound is from the board. Those are the positives. Here are the negatives. The sound isn't great and neither is the video quality. None of this has been remastered and my experience with bootlegs tells me that this is not an official Aerosmith release. It is very much like a bootleg although it is a silverback dvd and not a dvd-r. The bands performance is very average here for them which is still better than most.
1,Ocean DULL-er Scene,"The first mistake with the title is the word 'modern'. There is nothing new about this music - Ocean Colour Scene are stuck in the sixties and I wish they would stay there. The music is boring with little or no originality. Sadly OCS come from my hometown, a fact I am very ashamed of. I suppose this is what you get from 4 men who consider Paul Weller a musical genius. DO NOT BUY"
5,The Code,Nicky Barnes is the truth. He lived his life by a code. He lived his life by an oath of loyalty that he made to his brothers. What happens when you're betrayed by the ones whom you put your trust into. What happens when the people who you kept it real with don't keep it real with you? This book is on point and unravels the circumstances surrounding one question that a lot of people want to know the answer to. Why did Nicky Barnes snitch? It's often said that getting revenge is the best feeling in the world. In Mr. Barnes case I'd have to agree.
1,A Great Disappointment,"If you really want to discover the beauty of Piazzolla's music give this disc a miss. There is no substitute for Piazzolla's own albums - especially Tango Zero Hour, La Camorra, The Central Park Concert, etc. Piazzolla loved the guitar, and wrote a considerable amount of guitar music. It's a shame that this album doesn't do justice to Piazzolla's legacy. Guitar afficionado's should check out Baltazar Benitez' beautiful ""Music of Astor Piazzolla"" album instead. Many performers (such as Yo-Yo Ma, Gary Burton, Gidon Kremer, Pablo Zeigler, etc) have interpreted Piazzola much better than Al DiMeola."
1,"Come on people, take serious music seriously","I heard of Al DiMeola from a friend that know's I'm a fan of classical music and classical guitar. I was expecting a serious classical guitarist, like Segovia or Williams. I'm also a fan of Piazzolla's work, and I know how it's supposed to sound. This is not Piazzolla. This is Yanni and Kenny G plus a guitar. The synth is just stupid. There is no place for a synthesizer in Verano Reflections. And there is definitely no place for a synth is Cafe 1930. It should be flute and guitar, period. Let Yanni go play Chariots of Fire, and leave the recording session to real musicians."
3,Casio Men AQ180W-7BV,"The Watch just ok for the price, look much better in the picture. The strap is too long for small wrist."
1,"Gack. A boring, difficult, unrewarding read.","This thing...this book of Musicant's...isn't hitting on all of its cylinders. Musicant is incapable of maintaining a coherent chronology. His source material is limited. The work is not difficult intellecutally -- in fact, the opposite -- but is made difficult by Musicant's consistently poor use of English; he so often puts adjectives in the wrong place that the reader frequently has to stop and try to figure out (or guess) what he means...the difference between"
2,Book was not that good.,"I was recommended this book by a friend, he said I would love it because I loved chuck palahniuk. He lied, I did not enjoy this book. I mean, it was decent at best. I found it hard to get into."
5,"Excellent movie, everything everyone said before is correct yet","You can watch this movie in the dark because we find out that zombies are afraid of the dark. Take some time, watch the movie. You will find yourself totally engrossed in the film and come back wanting more redneck goodness."
1,Hide and Creep,"Not really very good, some interesting concepts like Zombies being afraid of the dark. So this movie could have been entertaining and I might even watch it again but billed as the American ""Shaun of the Dead"" - no way - maybe shouldn't have bought it and one star might not be fair but ..."
1,Not from Kodak; misleading!,"At the time of this review (and many others before mine) the info page says that this card is ""by Kodak"", but it's not. This is most likely intentionally misleading. Beware."
1,doesn't fit!!,"it said it would fit my 2005 ford f-250 and it does somewhat. I didn't noticed until I put it on, but it was somewhat deformed on the edges that go on the truck, and the worst part is that the two sided tape has been coming of from the very first day and i have been using other types of things to try to keep it up on the truck but it's falling down in some places and I'm about to take it off and toss it. TERRIBLE!!!!"
5,"Stop reading, put it in your cart and check out already!!!","Everyone's reviews were SO on the money. Digweed is a genius. A musical genius. It is good from the start - - different than what we're used to, but get over it already! The beats flow, the melodies are completely original and you won't want it to end. Right now I am in the mode where I refuse to listen to anything else. Go for it!!!"
2,"Not at all what I expected, having heard fabric18","Too bad i couldn't hear a sample before buying it! Fabric 18 is a lot better than this! Too bad, and a waste off money in my humble opinion!"
4,"slow, sweet, goooood","Fabric 20 takes many listenings in order to appreciate its full depth. I give this ablum 4 stars because I've heard better John Digweed mixes especially when he teams up with Sasha. The beginning of the mix is solid and I'm a big fan of the female vocals. The only track that put me off was True Science because it has a dark circus feel to it, which is plain weird and creepy. Each song blends smoothly into the next and they all have a mellow and relaxed atmosphere to them (prime for chilling out in the evening). John Digweed has been a hit and miss DJ for me, but Fabric falls in between these two extremes. It's definitely worth a listen."
2,Not orginal,I found this to be a possible boot-legged copy....not orginal packaging..DVD's skipped on some episodes....GOOD side of this I was refunded my money when I called about it....careful with what you buy online.
3,Decent season with some bright points.,"Im a die hard South Park fan this season hasd its bright points but some of the episodes for the first time in this shows history were just not funny such as Pee, Eat Pray and queef and Dances with Smurfs. There were also swome great episodes in the season such as Margaritaville, The coon, Fatbeard, Pinewood Derby, Fishsticks and Butters Bottom ________. The rest of the season is just okay i feel that 7 of the first 9 episodes of this season were great but it finished extremely weak. But, overall this is a decent season that i recommend for only a true South Park fan."
1,Price gouge,This title went from $29.99 to $17.99 the day after I received it.I wrote 3 times asking what the policy was for refunds or credit when something like this happens.Never got a response!Most retail policies are to compensate when price change happens so quickly.Should I assume by the lack of response that this is not the policy or anyone's concern?
1,If only there was a zero rating,"This is not your typical complete season. The outside packaging is plastic, and my 13th season arrived with broken /loose parts inside. I sent it back without even opening it."
2,not that good,"the book wasn't that great , i mean lynne graham did write good books than this one , i didn't like that nick her husband ignored her for 5 years because her father blackmailed him into this marriage and in the same time he loved her at first sight !! how come !!and he cheats on her because she was 17 years old when he married her and he didn't want to consume the marriage only after 5 years .... she should be a nun !!!so i feel that nick character was complicated .... do not recommend this book that much."
3,love it or hate it?,"This was different to say the least. romantic not so much, It was sad and frustrating. sure at the end i was so relieved the heroine had her happy ending. You will not be able to feel the love between the couple. The mere concept of them actually having a genuine love is hard to imagine. if you love happy endings, lots of anger, threats, and acts of cruelty between couples. This is your book! Otherwise read just to be masochistic."
4,Mislead,"Great book, easy quick read. Hero justified his infidelity. Heroine was publicly humiliated for years. However when the press gets wind that heroine may have a lover, hero goes ballistic. Hero has big double standards. My problem with the story was that hero got off easily. He was not repentant at all."
2,This book is backwards!,"This book has already put me to sleep twice! The authors spend too much time on how to take notes and write a paragraph, which we should already know how to do. However, they spend little or no time talking about *real* research -- what makes a good research project? How do we formulate a hypothesis? What kinds of anecdotal information should we be looking for? This is the only one of my education textbooks that I will be selling back!!"
1,Vague and incoherent,This book is appropriate for those who have little to no experience doing research. It is most appropriate for those wishing to do entirely qualitative investigations. I found it of little use.
4,Better,"Louise Erdrich has written a spell-binding tale that overall, grabs the reader's interest and keeps it. She seems best, however, at describing the landscape (with an almost lyrical, poetic manner) than at developing a solid and coherent plot. I found the relationship between Marlis and Candice to be unbelievable, and the entire Eleanor-thing was also a little perplexing.I am disappointed in how Erdrich describes Fargo. Her descriptions are basically those of a late 1940's Fargo, and certainly does not jibe with what Fargo, North Dakota, is like nowadays. Makes me wonder if she's been up here lately. Perhaps she ought to pay a visit before writing a novel about it."
3,"Sold my copy of Tenchu, but I'm keeping Red Ninja","Tenchu Fatal Shadows is like a PG-13 movie, and Red Ninja is like a rated R movie.It has lots of blood and gore, which is what I love especially since I'm a long time Manga anime fan. You will see blood gushing from the necks of decapitated enemies.There are some platform jumping sequences that can be frustrating, but by using trail and error multiple times I was able to pass those areas."
2,Red Ninja: End of Red Ninja,"50 bucks for crap!? The graphics, well not bad but.. not good. You will be fighting the horrid camera angles instead of your enemies. The ninja lady, I forgot her name, sounds constipated. Also, ninjas don't wear red. And she has no pants! WTF? The voice acting is more terrifying than Michael Jackson himself. DONT EVEN BUY!"
1,Who knows if it is any good?,"I bought this for a birthday a few weeks ahead of time. Got the message from the seller that it was on its way and never received it. I emailed them and they later said they overlooked the email. Fine but when I finally got the disc a month later (of course the second came two days after that) it didn't work. Neither did the second. In all the mix up Amazon ended up crediting me before the discs came (I paid $5 with shipping), so no harm done. But it just so happens that I found another at a thrift store (again before the two others came) and it didn't work either(not because of scratches). Must be a whole lot of them out there that got recorded wrong."
5,Pure Magnificance,"This is the absolute best recording of Mozart's 40th and 41st Symphonies that i have heard. both are crisp and clean. what's more, Levine conducts the 41st with pure passion and allows the music to breathe vitality and life. the 41st is by far Mozart's best music, shown by how this entire symphony flows like a river, never breaking apart, but rather moving freely from one melody to another."
3,Not very waterproof,"We use these as pet pee pads. We've used them a few times now and unfortunately they let moisture through to the bottom, so the floor underneath is damp. This seems to happen if the urination is near the edge, so that it leaks out of the seams; can't be sure about this though. When the urination is in the center, this happens less often or not at all. Disappointing."
4,Not too shabby...,"I bought this watch to replace my grandfather's late seventies generic brand watch which had just recently (last year) died. Overall, I am very impressed with the quality of this watch. Although it's not the most sylish piece of jewelry, it seems very sturdy and easy to program, etc... The only issue I had with it was that I preferred a stretchy wristband and maybe I didn't read the product description closely enough, but it has a tricky snap-closed wristband...hard for old people to close. Other than that, I was very satisfied with this product."
3,It's a nice beater watch. The clasp and band could have been better.,"The watch is definitely not in competitive with my $400 dollar Seiko. However it's a decent beater that you can take on hikes, kayaking, and other activities without worrying about potential damage.It's a stylish timepiece, however the band occasionally catches my arm hair when I put it on and the clasp is cheaply made. I would suggest this watch with a different band (rubber or leather)."
1,Not impressed,"I have been buying this same watch for a very long time. I have always liked the looks, funtionality and price of this watch since I am very rough on the exterior. I have one just like it but it is scratched up and the battery is getting weak so I decided to treat myself to a new one. The new one just don't match up. Looks identical but the band is hard to clasp and the night glow light is almost nothing, I cannot even read the time in the dark. I will probably take the guts out of the old watch and put it in the new case. But this is definitely the last one I will ever buy."
5,Great Watch,"This is the fourth of these watches I've had over many years so I'd be inconsistent to rate it less than 5 stars.I love 'em and that's my rating. I think I'd be remiss however if I failed to pick one nit for future buyers. The band on this copy is quite stiff,takes some doing to shape it to the wrist.The length adjuster is also quite stiff and also requires some ingenuity ie open and close the latch with a small flathead screwdriver. That said it's still a keeper."
3,Why can't we buy individual songs?? This is BS!!,"I already own the other songs from other albums that I bought. I just want Slack Hands by Galliano. Shame I can't buy it without spending $10 bucks. Oh wells, guess I'll just have to miss out. Bunch of *&^*ing BS!"
4,Good but not hard,"This book of 300 Sudoku puzzles is a great buy, with hours of mental escapism; however, the puzzles are not all that hard. None of the puzzles require any of the specialized techniques that truly difficult (or diabolical) puzzles require. Instead, all can be solved by basic and careful cycling through. This makes the book, with its large number of puzzles, (1) a good one for any level of player to have around (for those times when you just want to dive into a quick puzzle or two) and (2) a great one for just-past-beginner players, but (3) not a good choice for serious players looking for the more difficult puzzles."
2,Sort of a letdown in the Martial Arts Sudoku series,"I'm going through the entire ""karate sudoku"" series, and completed the 3rd degree green belt book, whose grids were designed by Longo and were much more challenging. This book is fun, but not nearly as difficult as the title would imply. I solved most of these grids in five mins or less, most of which involved little or no abstract logic. Beginners will enjoy this one. Those looking for a more serious challenge should skip this book and move on to the 2nd degree brown."
3,Hard? Hardly.,"There's nothing objectively wrong with this collection of puzzles. I've completed fifteen of them so far, and it's been relatively enjoyable. The problem is the difficulty, or lack thereof. I have not had to make one single ""pencil mark"" in any of the puzzles. To be sure of the lack of challenge, I turned to the back of the book and completed the last ten, which confirmed that every puzzle in this collection can be completed without any notation or advanced techniques. Considering I bought this thinking it would be challenging, it has hardly lived up to its purpose. Still, it can be fun to pass a few minutes here and there with the book, so I wouldn't consider it worthless. If you consider yourself an advanced solver, however, skip this."
5,"Complete, well-organized, excellent photos","Our family has been visiting Sanibel and Captiva for more than 30 years, and this book is the most complete guide we can imagine. The writing is so good (I'm a freelance writer myself), the information is well-organized, and the photography is excellent. We bought it while we were vacationing on Captiva and have already recommended it to cousins and aunts and uncles who also fish and shell there."
5,Good bar good price.,"Bar does what it says, clips are fairly good, they do slip a little but that is to be expected in exchange for the convenience they offer."
4,thanks Icon customer service,"I purchased this bar and it showed up without the spring clips. I spent 4 hours being bounced from department to department on the phone with Icon customer service. In the end I received the spring clips but posted the earlier low rating due to my poor customer service experience. Icon contacted me directly after rating them low and refunded my shipping costs to make things right. Thanks, I appreciate that. Was not able to pull my previous posted rating so posting a new rating of 4 stars. Very nice bar for the price and I have been using it regularly."
2,Nice watch but had to return it,I noticed that the watch band only has two adjustable settings. I made the adjustment to the smaller setting but it was way too big. Probably need to take out a link or two. The procedure to do that is on a youtube video that is more involved than I wanted to try. Too bad Casio didn't feel the need for more adjustable settings on the band. You shouldn't really need to remove links unless you have a very small wrist. I've never had to do that on other watches.
3,Look for another better option,"The watch looks too good in the picture, but its not that awesome..Pros: 1. cheap for its functions..Cons:1. Dial is very thick which doesnt look good.2. The glass is actually plastic , which tend to get scratches very easily.3. The watch is very light weight.. It doesnt feel like stainless steel.. (I would prefer a bit heavy watch)"
4,Watch okay if only.......,"Hello this was my first order here, well it was not directly amazon but anyways the delivery of that watch was one day over the promised delivery date and to top that it was the wrong watch not the one with a silver/chrome wrist band no I got the cheaper version with the black wrist band.Beside that the watch is fine and I only can recommend it just one point not on the watch in the manual didn't find mine appproval it was not explained how to turn on the automatic light feature on the watch for all that have that same problem press and hold the ""B"" button on your watch till the sign that it is on ("" * "") and with kinda magic as soon as you look in the right angle at your watch it illuminates."
2,Casio Men's AQ160WD-1BV Ana-Digi Electro-Luminescent Sport Watch,"Casio Men's AQ160WD-1BV Ana-Digi Electro-Luminescent Sport WatchVery nice watch, with multi functions. I had to return it because it would no fit my wrist.If I had kept it I would recommend this fine watch to anyone looking for a watch.The 2 stars is because the watch band would not fit my wrist."
1,Analog Display,"The display is essentially analog. I was hoping that the primary display was digital, hence, I have returned it, otherwise it looks like a reliable time piece."
3,okay,"Great watch except in one respect. The crystal is plastic, not glass, and it easily scratche. Too bad because otherwise I'd love this watch"
4,nice watch,"the casio watch I ordered for my husband was a hit ,very stylish for every day wear.He likes the black face and the digital back-ground display,vary nice watch for the money."
4,Nice watch,Nice watch for the money. I like the style and functionality. It has all the features I was looking for. The one complaint is the band size. I have large wrists and the watch band is too tight. I contacted Casio and they don't sell links for this watch. Had to purchase a new band to take the links from. Cost half as much as the watch alone.
2,Casio wATCH,"After 4 days the watch stopppd workingWater got inside of it, dont know how because it's water resistent up to 10 bar so i dont recommend this watch"
5,Great bang for your buck!,The watch is a great bang for your buck. The stock photos don't do it justice. It looks much better in real life than in the photos. The LCD display is very easy to read. I bought this watch to time my run & the bonus is that I can also wear it to work because its metal band gives it a dress watch kind of look. The alarm feature on this watch works perfect for me since it is not too loud and not too weak. Overall I like the watch and am happy with my buy!PS: First time I received my package for the watch there was a book instead of a watch. Probably some sort of a mistake but this was the first time I experienced this with Amazon.com. I have been shopping with Amazon.com for a long time and never experienced anything like this. But Amazon.com's customer service was amazing like always and after finding out about the mistake they sent me a new watch with next day shipping. So 5 stars for Amazon's customer service as well :)
4,What you see is more or less what you get,"Bought this watch for my 11-y old as a first ""serious"" watch. It's basically fine though does feel a little tinnier with a less scratch resistant cover than one might have hoped for. But the looks are great and my son is very happy. Delivery was brilliant and no problems whatsoever."
3,Good For Everyday,I just got this watch today 2/26/2010 while I am at work. So I have the watch I wear and this new one. The fist thing I notice is this is a very light weighted watch granted the watch I am wearing is a Seiko gold metal band. A bit dressy for work. The Casio is a nice everyday watch I like both the analog and digtial time settings. Setting the watch was pretty easy (it does require reading the manuel) The digtial information on the watch face is on a black background which gives it a mutted look and the back light does not give a lot of light to the dial. No where near as bright as a timex back light.If you are looking for a good all around watch this is a good item not to dressy or flashy and has a lot of good features. 5 alarms multi time zones and stop watch. I will wear this as my daily watch.
2,Not up to date,"These cards contain a fair amount of outdated information, especially in the internal medicine section. Some cover way too broad an area to really be useful in flashcard format; on the other hand, some cards are extremely brief. The lack of consistent format is also frustrating. I was quite disappointed."
1,Tech Support ... does it exist???,Have tried sereral times to reach tech support with no success. I am calling the standard tech support number at 800 SMC-4-YOU. My calls are placed at different times during the day and evening. Does SMC tech support really exist? Gee ... they were around to take my money.
2,3rd edition (latest) is bad,"I got the first edition of this book in the 1990s and I loved it. Recently (2007), I needed UNIX skills in my job again and I thought, ""Why not pick up the latest edition - the 3rd?"" Well folks - It is bad.(1) It is poorly printed. Much of the text ""fades out"" in the low-quality printing they did. Even the binding and physical paper feel cheap when handled.(2) Pages of text are unchanged from the early 1990s - which also seems cheap - except now it's worse, because they've added in typos and even technical errors.(3) The index is so full of errors, it's unusable. Which means, if I want to look something up - forget it.Save your money, folks. This edition is not worth the high price tag."
5,great exploration of gender equity issues,"my middle school students have found this book useful becauseit not only discusses gender issues in the world of business,but also offers strategies how U.S. women can be successful incultures with even less equitable relations between the genders than our own country."
3,"Fine disc, probably not ""desert island"" material...","A really fine recording...I bought it as part of a search for ""Le Rouet D'omphale (Omphale's Spinning Wheel) from Camille Saint-Saens, which is used as background music during the original radio productions of The Shadow (seeThe Shadow Scrapbook (Harvest/HBJ Book)) and was very pleasantly suprised by the Berlioz recordings, particulary the piece from ""Les Troyens"" (track 4)"
4,Fantastic! Your wits will be tested!,"This is a very LEVEL playing field this rpg brings forth using 3.5 or d20 rules. No big fireballs or arcane anything to help you. All humans makes ones really think hard. The classes are a bit bland but they get the job done. I love how the magic system is! I'd have to incorpate that into my own system. No fireball to save the day here! You use your wits and strength and hopefully you will make it, if not.. Oh well. That is what I so much like about it. So very flexiable and not much to get in the way of the dms or gms to get in the way of making a strong compelling storyline for the players to work in! Always thinking ahead and wise planning and even teamwork is stressed here. That is what an rpg should be! Get it, if not at least for the magic system!"
4,Christmas,"Every night before bed my son would pray for a Lightening Mcqueen with ""teethbugs"" for Christmas. I had to find it for him..and I did. Thanks for helping make his Christmas better."
3,WRONG COLOR -- NOT AS SHOWN !!!,"The color that is shown IS NOT the color that I received.This is a high quality SKULLGARD hat. Hat fits perfect on very first day worn.The color is LIGHT TAN. It looks nothing like others are wearing on job site.If you want to have a original LIGHT TAN SKULLGARD like nobody else,this hats for you!!"
5,Satisfied customer,"Always wanted to buy this particular hard hat but always thought it was alittle expensive. When I saw it was only $75, I couldn't pass it up. The hard hat fits and looks great!!"
1,Poorly Made,"Bought this last year after one of my grandchildren's birthday parties. Had a LOT of food and many small little food tents over the buffet table which were very cumbersome. Thought something larger would be much better so started searching and found this. Kept it in the packaging it came in until this past Sunday. Opened it up for use at my grandaughter's 4th birthday party and it came totally apart. There is a wire inside around the top spokes that apparently either came apart or snapped a small piece off. I'm thinking it snapped a piece off because I've tried to twist them back together and the wire is way too short. So, in other words, this turned out to be useless and a waste of money. Too bad, because it sure would have been used a lot more often in the coming months."
5,The best anime series money can buy!!,"On 1985 a cartoon series came up which changed the life of many people, including myself. So many things happened that were a first for a cartoon, the plot was amazing and the characters more real than many life series. Robotech set a precedent for future Japanese anime. Gundam, and other famous stories were developed thanks to the new concepts introduced in Robotech. Finally, after a long time we once more have the chance to watch this incredible adventure. In this particular release you will not only get the known episodes but also extras that come on a third DVD, which all fans will enjoy for sure. I already bought the first DVD boxed set and I can't wait for the second!If you ever saw Robotech or like Japanese anime, then this is a MUST!!"
3,A bit of fun and learning with a hitch.....,"The kids seem to love this learning software.My child keeps saying DW is silly or naughty for not eating properly, so I suggest the message does reach the mark.Yes there is a bit of squirting pesky gophers with water from a hose (note neither the hose or any other object is used to strike or injure the pests) so don't panic violence is not the theme and with proper parental guidance this software is certainly not a negative role model.You could certainly do worse.Re it doesn't work on a modern OS, well the 32 bit DW_32.exe certainly wouldn't run for me on XP (generates a Media Player crash), however if you run the DW_16.exe it runs fine....I'm sure TLC/BroderBund could fix this so have logged a fault call. Usually successful.Play with your child whilst they use this software and watch and enjoy as they learn and play."
4,nice little book,"good stories about the author traveling around searching for, buying, cutting, and enjoying opals. very nice color pictures. I not only liked the adventure stories, but learned about the history of mining, value of opals, and different kinds of opals. It's a great book if you have a casual interest. By the time you read this, you will probably want to own an opal if you don't already."
1,Don't Buy!,"I thought I was getting 8 plates for this price and I was very upset when it arrived and there was only 1. You could buy a plate directly from Correlle cheaper than what Amazon is charging. This is not the first time I have gotten screwed over by the way Amazon worded things. I think they do it intentionally. Don't buy from Amazon, it is a rip off!"
3,"I love Teresa Medeiros books, but.........","Teresa Medeiros is one of my favorite writers, but this book is so far my least favorite. The heroine was too focused on her weight issue. The story line was mediocre."
5,I really enjoyed this book!,"Teresa Medeiros is one of my favorite romance authors and this book was one of the best romance novels I've ever read.""The Dragon"" is passionate, mysterious, and captivating. The storyline is original and really catches your attention. I read the whole book in 2 sittings and was left wanting more.I would definitely recommend this book!"
3,Not up to previous books,"Medeiros used to be one of my favorite romance authors. I look for and read each new release. However, the last two, Charming the Prince and Bride and the Beast, are too fairy tale-cartoonish for my taste. Earlier works such as A Whisper of Roses were far superior in my opinion."
2,Don't Watch,"I did not like this movie! The main girl lies on multiple occasions throughout the movie and also very disrespectful to her Dad, yet she is supposed to be this great Christian girl. She never apologizes or thinks it's wrong to lie, deceive, or mouth off. It is supposed to be Christian but there is very little likable about the Christians in this film. I found myself liking the criminal and the guys in prison more than the girl and her family. Very disappointing!"
2,Songs from the station,"When I purchased this toy it said it had a train toy with the movie,and when I recieved it there was no toy.The movie worked great, and kids liked it but that was one of the reasons for purchasing,was for the toy."
1,No Silver Percy!,I just received my son's copy of Songs from the Station and there was NOT a silver Percy or ANY Percy with the DVD! I am not happy about this! Did anyone else order from AMAZON and happen to get the silver Percy?
2,Watch Band is Lousy - Not a good investment,"Yes, the watch band breaks every 2.5 years. AND... it's a proprietary band size, so it will cost you about $50 to replace the band... not a good investment for a $150 watch! I'm going to try to think of some creative re-use of my watch sans-band... maybe I'll nail it to my tool shed in the backyard (after all, it is water resistant and solar powered!)"
4,Watch band is a deal breaker.,"Loved the watch, it's feather light and the strap does not irritate like most watch straps I've tried. BUT, like nearly everyone else who's commented, my strap broke, and I find it unacceptable to have to spend $60 to replace it."
2,Polish is more complex,"This is a very basic course to say a few phrases in Polish to show an attempt to speak a highly inflexed language (nouns are declined verbs are conjugated). They change a lot. The course does not clarify, if I am using the familiar form of a phrase or the formal form of a phrase. Europeans do take the ""familiar form"" offensive until they give you permission to use this form. Also there are both a male and a female form for the past tense which the Booklet does not explain this usuage by putting (m) or(f)after the phrase. I have used other editions of In-Flight languages, they need to arrange words and phrases at the beginning to be shorter and native speakers to be slower."
2,Not My Favorite.......,I like tortilla soup and love cilantro and lime but this is not going to be a repeat at my house. I bought a different brand of tortilla soup and it was amazing. Since this was on sale I tried it.... something was just not quite right about it. It seemed too sweet. Had a hard chunk of something I couldn't identify. I will finish the pot because I'm cheap but won't go back and buy more. Glad I didn't stock up.
5,American Combat Planes of the 20th Century,"This is the best ""Airplane Book"" to come along in a very long time. Speaking as the widow of a pilot, I can tell you that he would have been thrilled with this book. The information and pictures are outstanding. It's the perfect Christmas, Birthday, Father's/Mother's Day or any other day gift that you can give a pilot or anyone interested in aviation. Ray Wagner is a legend in aviation and put an amazing collection of photos with all the information about them together. Jack Bacon is also an outstanding publisher who has an impressive list of books published by his company. I'd give this book 10 stars if I could or more! I guarantee you will enjoy this book if you like planes at all. L. Wicksten, Sparks/Reno, Nevada"
2,Should have listened to the other reviewers...,"I should have listened to the other reviewers here and skipped this book. These are definitely not ""black belt"" puzzles. I've done puzzles labelled as ""easy"" that were harder than these. I can do them in my head - without making any notations at all. I may just have to donate this to my son's 5th grade class... or only work in it when I'm trying to bore myself to sleep at night."
1,What a disappointment,"I've been working on bringing my game to the advanced level and thought I could ""grow"" into this book if it was too tough. I shouldn't have worried. This is an intermediate sudoku book-- at best."
1,Really easy puzzles - title is misleading,"I agree with other reviewers, these are really simple puzzles. I have just started doing puzzles from a weekly newspaper,and these are far simpler than their ""medium"". I would return it if I had not written in it!"
2,Pretty Tame Stuff,"All things relative, of course, but this hardly earns the ""black belt"" moniker, it's at the level of Will Shorts' ""Moderate"" puzzles. You can solve them by simple scanning - strictly hunt and peck. In fairness, I have only done the first few and the last one - hoping it got progressively harder. But it didn't. If you want not-very-challenging puzzles, it's a good value, but, if like me, you expect something rigorous behind the name ""black belt,"" move on."
5,WHEN JESUS BECAME GOD.,"THIS A MUST READ FOR ANY CHRISTIAN WHO HAS NOT TOTALLY GIVEN-UP THEIR ABILITY FOR CRITICAL ANALYSIS. SHAME ON THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH FOR NOT MAKING THIS HISTORY KNOWN TO ITS PARISHONERS. AS IF ITS PAST HISTORY IS NOT BAD ENOUGH (INQUISITION AND ALL) TO LET ITS MEMBERS BELIEVE THAT THE DIVINITY ISSUE WITH JESUS WAS A DONE DEAL WITH NO DISSENTION IS BLASPHEMY ITSELF. TO READERS OF THIS CRITIQUE, IT WAS AN ISSUE OF CONTENTION FOR NEARLY 400 YEARS AND DID NOT DIE OUT WITH THE CONCLUSION OF THE COUNCIL OF NICEA IN 325. I CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL THAT ARIANISM IN MANY FORMS IS WITH US TODAY. THIS BOOK IS WELL DOCUMENTED AND MAKES DRAMA OUT OF THIS MID-FOURTH CENTURY PIECE OF HISTORY."
4,What did you expect?,"It's the music from the movie in the order it was played. Two minor extras that mean nothing.You either have to have this, or you could care less.The book is poorly constructed like another reviewer pointed out. The other Complete Soundtracks were packaged better."
2,"Love the soundtrack, but not the noises","I bought this set a long time ago and loved it, but it was stolen. Then I found it for a great deal here on Amazon so I bought it. I some of the tracks still on my computer, but wanted the complete set once again. I actually didn't have a lot of time to listen to it until recently and I also noticed the same ""pink"" noise that another reviewer mentioned. It only happens a dozen times or so like he mentioned, but it is really annoying when it happens. Sad to think that probably a bunch of these discs are like this."
4,"Great music, few complaints","As with all of the ""Star Wars"" soundtracks, this score is excellent. And in the case of ""The Phantom Menace"", at least for me, more enjoyable to listen to than watching the actual movie it's from.In any case, I would've liked to see the version of ""Duel of the Fates"" from the other soundtrack on this album as well. Since this is one of the best pieces, it'd be nice to have it on here in a form which isn't broken up the way it is in the movie.Also, I can't quite figure out why it was decided to differ the way the music was put onto this compilation from the deluxe soundtracks for the first 3 movies. Not that I particularly mind it being arranged exactly as it was in the movie, however I found the organization on the previous deluxe soundtracks somewhat more efficient.Other than that, the only other thing I'd really want on it is the THX sound effect. It has the 20th Century Fox fanfare, why not the THX as well?"
3,Regular,aparentemente la foto no es lo que venden el reloj es sin brillo deslucido mal acabado no recomiendo este articulo para nada a pesar de ser buena marca
4,Casio watch,This is a great inexpensive watch! The fit & finish is much better than I expected. For a $20 watch I'm very pleased.
3,buy another,"It's a not so good watch.The mica scatch easily because of the material and the shape (it's curve), the watch itself is plastic painted to look metallic, and you can't read the LCD with the light included in the watch. Keep searching for another watch (this one is pretty cheap tho)"
2,"Nice watch, broken when I received it","It is a nice watch, however the band was broken, and there was no way I could get it fixed with amazon. This is a major concern with me. It wasn't shipping damage, so I couldn't go to the shipper, is was broke from Amazon, and there are no known methodologies for returning it to Amazon. Now I am worried about the laptop I ordered."
3,good,"very good item, so nice, perfect and elegant. I enjoy it so much. I receved it before the normal time, from usa to mexique."
2,NOT A TEN YR BATTERY,"BOUGHT THIS WATCH IN 2009 AND MY BATTERY DIED LATE 2011,NOT A TEN YR. BATTERY. MAYBE A NEW BATTERY WILL LAST THAT LONG,AND WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH THAT WILL COST,WE'LL SEE.OTHERWISE A GREAT WATCH."
2,The devil to set,Like the looks and weight of the watch but it is very difficult to set the time or even to get the watch started. The print in the instruction book is very small which only compounded the problem.Gave up on setting the digital time and just using the analog time.Daylight savings time is here now but the watch will remain in standard time--even though there is supposed to be a way to have the time change automatically. VERY HARD TO SET UP WATCH
2,"Hard to set the analog, face scratches easily","I bought this watch for $15, so I realize it's cheap. I'm an airline pilot, thus travel half my life usually having to change time zones once/day. I just sold my Breitling and needed a watch like this, however, I have found that the face scratches very easily and now I'm looking through a cloudy face. Worse than that, setting the hands (the digital and analog ""float"" and aren't tied into each other) is tedious. Hands can only go forward, and only slowly (as in about 6 seconds/hour). Thus, changing time zones can take up to 3 min's. That said, I could buy 200 of these watches to the cost of a Breitling Aerospace, so I shouldn't complain. Just realize this watch might drive you nuts."
4,Casio Ana-Digi Watch Review,"The watch is a very good buy. The alarm function, however, is at too high of a frequency for my old ears to hear so I can not use it. The other functions work fine and I am very satisfied with my purchase."
4,great watch,"Very smart and sleek looking watch. I wear it for work and play. I was amazed with all the functions and the quality, ten year battery and for the price. It stays up on my wrist, not like other watches that move around my wrist so I can't see what time it is without turning the watch back to the top of my wrist. My only complaint is the instruction manual is so small it is hard to read. I found the manual on the internet, downloaded it and wala. Very happy with the watch and amazon as allways."
5,Perfect for daily usage.,Perfect for daily usage. Also worth deal for such a low price. Only issue is watch band is little long for me. Still couldnt find a way to adjust it.
3,"Too Thick, but good watch","Only problem I have this watch is, that this is not a sports watch, as it said. Very thick, hence can not use for sports. It get damaged very easily. If you want a sports watch, buy any TIMEX product, they are great. I finally gave this one to my brother, as he likes it and now wears as his casual watch.Watch is great in appearance and worth for the money. Great functionality, different time zones...my brother love it."
2,The instruction print is too small to read. Why don't you end it ready to run? I have spent several hours and s,"I have spent several hours and still have NOTHING set in place. Can I return it for ""start -up""? Help!"
2,ok for this price,"it is ok as a watch for this price, but the case is plastic and not reliable enough."
4,a complicated family story with a unexpected ending.,"I have just finished reading this novel and found it to be intriguing.It is a story with many twists and surprise developments yet it also was in a way rather predictable.I do not usually read mystery type books but this one got me hooked and I was interested to see what was going to happen. One of the main characters , Grandma Violet was a wonderfully entertaining potrayal of an old lady who had many dark secrets and she herself made the book worth reading. I think anyone who enjoys stories about complicated families would love this book"
3,Just to look at,"I have owned this comforter and shams for over 4 years. I have had it dry cleaned once, as I would never wash it. When it arrived I knew right away it was more delicate than I had expected. With alot of care, it remains new looking. So, if you are looking for the usual type of comforter check out Penney's, etc."
2,Note --- No Musicians!,"Be aware that this DVD features wonderfully recorded and performed music, but the video is all travel log of Russia; you will see no performers. And for me, the rewarding part of Rachmaninov is watching hands hard at work."
5,enthusiastic reader,"Pete Rennebohm does an excellent job of building his characters and bringing unexpected twists to a story line that at first seemed fairly simple and common. I couldn't put the book down. The story seemed to gain momentum as I got into it. When I finished the book, I felt a certain sense of relief for certain of the characters coupled with a sense of anxiety as the story reached a feverish conclusion. I had to stop for a minute and catch my breath. The author did a great job of building his characters to the point where you really felt you knew them and they were very believable.I can't wait for his next book!"
4,A Very Nice Album,"I wouldn't think Sharon Shannon's music is for everyone. She has a number of songs on YouTube (Galway Girl, Cavan Potholes, Blackbird etc... ). Take a listen and see what you think. She reminds me of an Irish Poi Dog Pondering.If her music hits the right spot, this album is a good place to start.Good Luck."
2,Muzzy is fuzzy (sounding that is),"So glad I borrowed this from the library and didn't buy it. I have a 3 y.o. and an 11 y.o.; we all know basic mandarin and I'm always looking for material to use. The story is bizarre and my 3 y.o. loses interest after about 20 minutes. But the worst part is, the soundtrack is muffled, the music cheezy, it sounds like it was recorded on an 8 track in the back of a Dodge. The Mandarin version does not include software, as other versions do. Some sections of this just don't apply to Mandarin like they might in the Spanish or French version(i.e. the repeated use of the alphabet). What you get for the price is 6 ""episodes"" on 2 DVDs, which is about 1 hour 40 minutes, and then you get an audio CD which is just the soundtrack without the pictures, and that's it. That's IT!"
2,drive medical safety rail,"very poorly built, the side rails have a tendency to buckle outwardlywhen raising or sitting. would never buy this product again."
1,"Misleading Quality, Poor","This item is very cheaply made and is not of durable material. The casting on this product causes it to warp in the sun and after three weeks of placement it looks horrible. It would have been much cheaper and durable to make one out of wood or buy a lattice. This manufacturer needs to seriously consider a refund on this item due to failure to maintain form and function. Please do not buy this if you seek a durable solution, it could be used for a small flower arrangement or even a child's sandbox and is worth around $40 at the most."
4,Mine needed a little extra help,"This was bought to contain and restrain my garbage can. My house now definitely looks neater without the can blown all over the lawn.The spikes that came with it did not adequately stabilize it. After one storm it completely collapsed. Now that it has been stabilized with wood that has been attached to the house, it is living up to my expectations."
2,Could be better,This product is fairly flimsy b/c of the backside being hollow and it would be good if it was about 1 - 1.5 ft. taller.
1,"meh, it's alright","bought this, and installed it 3-days ago. Bought it to cover up some unsightly AC condensers, and it works for that, sure. The problem is, if you can see the back of these units, they look pretty bad. I think most people would use this to screen more than one side of something, and if that's true, you can see the back of these screens. I think 90% of people would be disappointed by that. It doesn't really beautify a yard the way it should. Look for another solution for AC condensers in the backyard for sure."
4,Death in his saddlebags,"Charlie is my uncle and i grew up hearing these stories. It was so very nice to finally have them in print. Although some of the stories are a little far fetched, they are very entertaining. It's a good book to read to learn about the Prescott area."
5,Nice Book.,If you like his art you'll love this book. It's big a colorful. And his art work is outstanding.
3,ok,The book is OK I guess - It's a text for a course I was doing. I was in good condition when I got it.If you have to buy go ahead. It has proven useful.
3,"Good, but not as good as...","...his other works in this series. I'm a Glen Cook fan, I don't really read anyone else in the sci-fi genre, but this particular book of the Garret, PI series left me with questions. Just seemed like there were too many loose ends, the plot kinda meandered around, and it wasn't as focused as it could have been. That said, even a fair Glen Cook novel is a better read than just about any other sci-fi out there."
1,This book didn't help me...,"I started this book because I heard the movie was great. However, I have a homework assignment thats due this Friday(its now Wednesday)I do not understand a word in this book: its all in 15th century english! I do NOT recommend this book for an asignment!"
5,Fantastic.,"I've owned this CD since the early-mid 90s. It is fantastic; a great representation of the great opera tunes sung by great interpreters of arias. One needn't love it as much as I do, but I still have friends from college who are clamoring for copies of their own. Since I don't relish ripping CDs for others' consumption, I'm online to purchase this album as a gift once again (it is now late-2007)."
5,Lysol an old friend,"I can only say good things about lysol. You will always know the spell of lysol, while different, I think different in a good way. I use it all around the house floors, counters, tiolets. I even put just a bit in the laundry, especially with flu season. I feel lysol is an old friend I grew up with and can trust."
5,An Oldie But A Real Goodie,Remember that strong smell in Hospitals many years ago? Well this product still works on most germs and viruses and well woth having a bottle around!
2,Found cheaper,Bought this on Amazon. Next day went to local Dollar Store and found same item exactly for 4.79.I should of searched more. Look at your local Dollar General or Dollar Store.
4,Works for a 2007 Explorer Sport Trac too,This rain deflector is a stylish addition to my 2007 Ford Explorer Sport Trac (even though it is listed for a 2005). It is easy to install and it helps to keep rain water from entering my truck when the rear window is opened. I would recommend it to others.
3,Practical,"I work in finance and have read a number of books on the topic, I did recently purchase a copy of 'trading pairs'. I havn't finished reading it yet, but I can understand it is a little hard to follow but either way it does target the correct people.I myself am not a math genius so the simplicity works with me, for hardcore quants this book will leave you fairly unsatisfied, though for everyone else it would be more practical."
3,more details about this recording,"This was recorded live in 1982and released by Buena Suerta Industrias Musicales, Inc.(cin cin) Made in ItalyThe quality of recording I find is very loud but otherwise a fine performance"
4,See this movie or read the Book before it's too late!,"Though the book is better than the movie, the movie stands well on its own. Like other reviewers, I saw the movie several years before I read the book.Strange, topical coincidence is that Bush's nominee for Secy of Defense if the chairman of Gilead Sciences. (The country created by the religous zealots in the book/movie is called the Republic of Gilead.)Is it time to get out of the US before fiction becomes fact?"
2,Did they read the book!,"The book was full of action and suspense yet the film lacked all of this. The film lacked the feeling of opression and inner rebellion that offred experienced throughout the novel, and turned the ending into something like a trite romance movie, the same applies to her relationship with Nick. The regime of Gilead is barely addressed, and instead it seemed to concentrate on offred's relationship with men, changing the plot until it was barely recognizable, a dead Luke and Commander? Ruin the plot why don't you! However, Serena Joy (Faye Dunaway) gave a good performance in a totally new role independent of the book, as did the commander."
2,Decent,"This was a decent movie with fair acting and some interesting points, but it fails to go anywhere.While we get some background on the necessity of the Handmaids, we never really learn the purpose of the war, or any details like that. The movie is pretty boring, with passive acting which really doesn't stand out, and Natasha Richardson wasn't very convincing at all that she wanted to see her daughter again. I don't know; the book was very good, and although the movie follows it, it lacks something, andis just a long boring mishmash of potential.If this is on TV, you might want to watch, but otherwise just read the book and leave it at that."
2,Strange Things Afoot,"A very strange visionary tale that I believe suffers in adaptation from book to the silver screen, THE HANDMAID'S TALE does boast a very solid performance from an exuberant Natasha Richardson and an unusually stoic Robert Duvall. While I'm not exactly certain whether or not the point of the picture is made as soundly as it could be, the theme of genetic perfection is often times handled all too delicately on film. That said, the films does contain the pivotal scene of attempted conception, with Duvall and Richardson doing the nasty, while Duvall's wife aids somewhat in the process; this single scene, filmed in almost a basic documentary style and void of passion, stays with the average viewer long after the picture fades."
1,An Insult to Margaret Atwood.,"A cheesy, thoughtless rendition of one of my favorite books. The book contains some of the most beautiful narrative told in Atwood's unmistakable prose... the movie replaces ALL of her work with this with some talentless hollywood hack's shallow after-school-special dialog... and that's just the tip of the iceberg. I'd recommend ""Volcano"" before I'd recommend this trash."
1,Liberal Garbage,"This film and the book that inspired it are a pessimistic vision of what our world would be if we let the wrong people and wrong systems have their way. Its premise is not completely unrealistic, I must admit, and we only need to look at the Taliban and its treatment of women to know this.Still, I felt during the entire movie as if I were being preached to by an anarchist disguised as a filmmaker/artist. The film's far-left-wing indoctrination, or far-right, depending on how you view it, was not for me. If the political spectrum is indeed a circle, with both of our main political parties seated toward the top of that circle, this is a story brought to us by someone at the bottom of that circle. Right next to the Libertarians.As someone who puts at least a moderate amount of faith in our economy, policital parties and our government in general, I recommend you do anything else besides watch this piece of paranoid propaganda. It was a waste of my time."
5,Great Lawnmowing Hat,"Had a hard time finding a hat to fit my giant noggin...this is great, provides a lot of coverage for my face while I'm mowing my acre of grass."
4,Classic Christmas stories,Santa claus is comming to town and the little drummer boy are wonderful christmas classics that can only be seen on cable now (if your lucky enough to find them). Santa claus is comming to town is the story of how Santa came to be and how people tried to stop what he was doing. It also shows where and why certain traditions were started. It is a wonderful story for kids and adults alike. The little drummer boy is my personal favorite. It is the story of an orphan boy who ends up meeting Jesus and doesn't feel he has a gift worthy of the new born king. Then he realized he can play a song on his drum for him and give a peice of himself. This is a wonderful movie that the whole family can enjoy. To get both movies on one disk is a bonus and a great gift for the whole family.
4,Great Watch!,"There is something really cool about g-shock watches that I had never encountered before owning one. I purchased my first g-shock watch at Wal-Mart last year in the discount bin for $24.00 (dw-6600). I have been really blown away by this watch since purchasing it, and wanting to buy another ""G"", while researching the matter, the dw-5600 always seemed to get great reviews. I ordered one thru Amazon.com, and it arrived the other day. This watch is not as thick as the dw-6600, and consequently, fits under shirt sleeves a lot easier. It doesn't make a statement like my other one, but I like the ""understatedness"" of this one. It is a pretty basic watch, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's easy to get wrapped up in all the different things that g-shock watches can do, but for a solid, no-nonsense watch that can take a ton of abuse (I wear it playing racquetball) this one is tough to beat."
5,Meets expectations,"I purchased this item as a gift for my 16 year old grandson who is very engaged in HS sports, namely track, wrestling, and football. He didn't have a watch. His first words when seeing it were ""I needed a sports watch."" The quality seems very good."
4,Best for my buck.,"Oh, how I shopped for a new, inexpensive watch. Replaced a dis-continued Timex. My Casio is easy to read for updates on the time, day, date, etc. It is attractive, and appears to be a lot more expensive than it is. However, 2 problems have raised their ugly heads; buckle and tides. The buckle on the watchband insists on rubbing, and cutting it's way into my wrist. I wear a small bandaid as a buffer zone, but how many years must I invest in bandaids? The tides are a neat feature for fishermen, and I qualify. However, even with my college education, I've been unable to adjust the tides feature. It's flashing.....but....for where....and what time?????In any case, I refuse to return it...Its other features outweigh the bloody discomfort and the way-out tides gizmo.Did I mention there's no need for batteries??"
3,Good,"i like the watch, its not great looking but is durable and fulfills the purpose of a sports watch which is why i bought it in the first Place. overall a good buy."
5,the same for years!!!,"Is the same G Shock which I have in 1985.The first one I had, te battery lasted 9 years!!Just one concersn is about the wristband which seams to be a little bit hard than my old one,But the price is amazingly good for this watch."
5,Awesome!!!,I just got this watch today and I really like the way it looks and its really simple to operate my dad used to have this watch back in the 80's now I have the same watch in the 21st century besides that this is my first Casio G-Shock if I like it I will continue to get the other G-Shock models.
5,"Great, simple watch","This is now a modern classic. Simple watch ,takes 2 minutes to learn how to use.ProsGood valueHard wearingSimple to useStops you look at your cell phone for the time.Cons---"
5,Love the Retro Look!,"I bought this watch after carefully deliberating and studying the reviews because I wanted an inexpensive digital watch that would (hopefully) last me a lifetime. I chose this particular model for its retro appearance. My dad told me how he had this exact watch in the 80's and that was a big selling point for me. The backlight is nice and bright and it's simple to figure out every function. I haven't even opened the instruction manual yet. On a side note, some reviews on other sites said the back casing is made of resin. This is false (as far as this particular model is concerned) because the casing is made of stainless steel which has a satin finish instead of the polished screwbacks I've seen on the originals from the 80's (which is the only con about this model). Overall I am very pleased with my new favorite watch and look forward to wearing it every day."
4,Interesting footnote to the history of John Palumbo/Crack The Sky,"It's hard to believe, but I think this is the first John Palumbo-related major label release. The majors ignored Crack The Sky and Palumbo's solo releases (and continue to do so) but, for some reason, BMG picked up Palumbo's one-off Cruel Shoes and issued it in 1992.Musically, yeah, it may be the best Steely Dan album of the 90's. Good to great tunes and very good production (not terribly slick for this type of music). Rick Witkowski adds a bit of guitar here and there....never a bad thing.If you're a Crack The Sky fan who managed to stumble onto this review, by all means pick it up. Even though this music sounds nothing like CTS, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.4 1/2 stars."
3,"Good idea, imperfect execution","I love the functionality of this tray, but wish the lids fit a little more securely. Not so that you can't remove them with one hand (as I often need to do), but at least enough so that they keep what's in them well protected and fresh. Otherwise, it's a lovely item."
3,Joan Sutherland and diction,"Yes, she has (had) a beautiful voice. Her diction is awful. I like to read librettos and follow along while listening to operas. Don't lose your place while listening to Ms. Sutherland sing because she gives no verbal clues as to where she is in the song. You'll have to wait for somone else to sing in order to figure it out."
5,"The ""voice of the Century""",Sutherland is the voice of the century. This cd proves it.I give it 10 stars
1,What a rip off,This was an awful rip off with the DVD deceptive. For $50 ...it is only 10 min clips of interviews with her. I was hoping her entire sudition would have been on it. Did not happen. It was a very poor clips of her which is disjointed and way too short for the charge of $50. DON'T BUY IT....UNLESS U HAVE $50 to throw away. I think Susan would be upset with this DVD charge and production.
5,Simply Beautiful,"Susan has such a pure voice. Her God given talent plus her simplicity are so refreshing at a time when everything else in the world seems so complicated. Just to relax and listen to her sing makes for a ""BETTER DAY."""
1,Remastered? UNMASTERED!!,"Can I leave zero stars? I've never written a review, but felt compelled this time. Someone is looking to make some money by using the word ""Remastered"" in the description of this DVD. The thing barely played in my DVD player. All sorts of strange distortions. I really felt ripped off. Sent it back and am waiting for refund. Get the 2001 VCI Entertainment version of this fascinating (sometimes corny) film. There was never a need for this version, except to put some money in someone's pocket. AVOID THIS VERSION!"
1,The dvd does not run in any players,"I got the movie on time, all was well until I tried to play it in my dvd player, on the tv screen read that I could not watch it, that it has a PAL on it. I went to other dvd players and the samething. I CAN NOT watch this movie AT ALL. I feel this was not a good item, and would like to get another copy that I can watch in my dvd player. Also there should be a better warning on dvd or blu rays about this PAL on the disc. I am not happy, Joelle"
3,Kinda nice. Easy read.,I liked it. Quoted same people several times throughout. I was hoping for lots of different quotes. Lent the book to my brother who is very interested in it.
1,What a waste,"Congratulations Herman Melville - you have a good vocabulary and know how to describe a setting.Benito Cereno was a waste of my life. Yes, the story is interesting and political and provocative but it could have easily been condensed by 50 pages. The build up is completely unnecessary. if you are desparate to read this book, read only the first 15 and last 15 pages"
5,American Ninjas and Fighters,"American Ninjas and Fighters with actors such as Michael Dudikoff, Tadashi Y. ,David Bradley, and Steve James is an excellent compilation of music from various American Ninja movies. The music was composed by George S. Clinton and Michael Linn. Each song is very long as in (1) ""The Cobra Strikes"" (from AMERICAN NINJA III) 4:15, (2) ""American Ninja"" 23:11, (3) ""American Ninja II: The Confrontation"" 16:12, (4) ""American Ninja III: Blood Hunt"" 10:24, (5) ""Avenging Force"" 20:54. The Total Time of the cd is 74:56. It's totally awesome, rare, out of print, and hard to find. I recommend acquiring."
4,Loved it,"After reading the Peter Freestone book about him (which I thought was only so-so), I was advised to find this one. It took a while, but it was worth the wait! I have a used copy of the paperback version. The pictures are great, and although it was a very choppy writing style,(jumping around from one thought to the next) I thoroughly enjoyed it. It made me laugh out loud a few times, and cry at the same time. I really felt that I know more about Freddie now, which was what I had originally started out wanting. He will forever be missed by so many."
5,A message to all Freddie Mercury Fans,"This is a must-have for ALL Freddie fans. The book is very hard to come by, but well worth the time and effort. The photographs alone were worth the cost of the book-which can be prohibitive. Jim Hutton obviously cared about Freddie a great deal-this abook is a very fitting tribute to one of the greatest musical talents ever. Freddie Mercury was a great star-the account of his last days will bring tears to your eyes. If you are a true Freddie Mercury fan, try to get a copy of this book. Believe me, it WILL be worth the effort!"
2,Jim Hutton had NO IDEA.,"I am sorry I read this book. My husband got it right and said, ""Jim Hutton was only a gardener who got benefits"". This is NOT a capture of Freddie Mercury, this is Jim Hutton's fantasy of what HE thinks went on between him and Freddie. Hutton was EXTREMELY jealous of Mary Austin, who was Freddie's long time confidant, who was Freddie's dearest friend. I would adore anything that Mary would put down on paper about Freddie because Mary is the ONLY one who knew Freddie best. Not ""the gardener with benefits"". Absolute trash, Absolute National Enquire (America) or Sun (UK) material. I know it's not nice to speak ill of the dead but Jim Hutton had no IDEA. None at all and he should have left well enough alone, because he was not there, he was only there in his fantasy world. The pictures were nice, that's why I gave it two stars instead of one one star."
4,Her girl-next-door voice lulls you into a heavenly bliss.,This is my first Randy Crawford CD but it sure won't be the last. Her voice is so clear and soft you'll think she's the girl next door singing in the shower. I recommend this CD purely on Randy's vocal clearity and crispness.
2,Music is Good but Filming is Bad,The filming on animals and scenery looked like those done by high school kids. The music is good as expected but it would be better if it is available in audio CD rather than coming with the 3rd class video images.
1,READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY!,"The Starker recording of the Bach cello suites is perhaps the best music ever made. They appear on RCA and Mercury. BUY the Mercury, not the RCA recording. There is a big difference!"
5,Historic Recording!,"This CD is amazing. Never before have I seen such a great combination between the greatest two guitarists that produce such an amazing effect (not to compare with the Assad's Brother, but I think JB & JW are more musical!). The work choices are very delicate. The great balance in the sound of JW and the colorful timbre of JB's guitar did really bring out the best results and this is what I expect to hear from classical music. My comments are the same for their first CD. Hence, I advise that if you really love classical music or classical guitar music in particular, please buy these CDs. These are the historic recordings that music lovers must have in their collection! (and the recording quality is also flawless, much better than a lot of new products on the market now)"
1,Absolutely Lousy,What were they thinking? I get the sense you had these guys who watched too much Tarantino and thought they could hatch up something violent but cool. The movie seems misogenistic and the dialogue is poor. I think high school kids could write better. I give them credit for finishing the project but I'm sure they maxed out their credit cards to finance this loser. Or maybe they didn't have to max cuz their trust funds helped them cover expenses.
1,The horror of boredom and nothingness,"The girl is kinda cute. Other than than, this is the most boring movie I have ever seen. There is nothing in the movie that helps develop compassion or interest in the character except that he had a messed up childhood. I must think that the people that gave this movie high ratings are teenagers who never had sex or been close with a girl. This is about as close as they'll get. There is no meaningful or interesting dialogue between the girl and the boy. After 1 hour 30 minutes, I thought I'd might be in for a unexpected change but nope no meanginful dialogue unless you consider yelling, screaming, and putdowns to be meaningful (of course this may be meaningful if you've never had dialogue with a girl)."
4,Not Trackable but Better Than Most Swag,"I have been Geocaching for a while and I am often surprised at the lack of imagination that I see in the goodies that are left in caches all over the US. Although it is about the hunt, not the swag, many people like to find something fun as a reward for finding a well hidden container.I have purchased 20 of these coins in the past and I am buying 20 more now. I have gotten several emails from cachers thanking me for placing these fun coins. They are also great for microcaches and at this price they are easy to place in almost every cache that you find. Although they are not trackable they are certainly worth the cost."
3,A smooth take.,"This is the version that takes the rock out of the rock opera. Paul Nicholas (Jesus) has a nice voice, but he isn't a rock singer and this part really needs one. He can't reach the high notes and falls rather flat on some crucial passages. I quite like Keith Burns as Judas and Claire moore as Mary. Victor Spinetti's Herod is very amusing. But most of the other singers seem to lack the passion that is required (listen to the lifeless 'Pilate's Dream' and 'Simon Zealotes').There are much better versions of Jesus Christ Superstar, but musical lovers who aren't too fond of rock music might prefer this smooth take."
1,Stay away !,"If you ever listened to the original recording of Jesus Christ Superstar ( yeah-yeah , that one , with Ian Gillan , from the late-late 60's ) then do yourself a favour and DO NOT touch this 20th Anniversary nonsence . Just say NO ! What a pathetic re-make this record turned to be ! Stick with Mr.Gillan & company from all them years back and enjoy Jesus Christ Superstar as we know it !"
3,Mrs. Prekins,Read the book and watch the movie. the movie is wonderful for a first attempt movie. It's a great family movie
4,Roadsaw - 'Rock 'N Roll' (Small Stone Records),"Liked this (slightly) earlier Roadsaw CD title as much as I did their current self-titled piece. Here, on 'Rock 'N Roll' you get a total of - yet another eleven heavy-hitting stoner metal songs - like the TOTAL boot-stomper ""Bad Ass Rising"", ""Disconnected"", the inspiring ""Your Own Private Slice Of Hell"", ""That's Mr. Mother****er To You"" and ""Burnout"". Line-up: Craig Riggs - vocals, Ian Ross - guitar, Tim Catz - bass and Hari Hassin - drums. Recommended for fans of Kyuss, Fireball Ministry, Nebula, Fu Manchu, Atomic Bitchwax and possibly Monster Magnet. A good pick."
5,Life changing,"This heartfelt, magesterial work Das Lied von der erde as sung by Kathleen Ferrier is heartbreaking in the poignant understanding Ferrier has of Mahlers intentions to convey the many emotions, particularly of anguish and resolution and acceptance of the human condition. I need to be feeling very strong in order to hear it. It is truly life changing."
4,Living for music,Funny story of a music band by this music band where young people overcame everything to win a prize-and die.
5,Another Johnstone Hit,Johnstone continues the 39-volume series entitled The Last Mountain Man with his great book. Johnstone writes with energy which will not let you put the book down. He ends each chapter with you on the edge of suspense so you have to ready the next chapter to see what happens.
4,But here's the run,"These are great jeans; the all over dark color is slimming, something that's not easy to find. Stylists are always telling plus sized girls to wear dark jeans for the best results, but finding jeans without a great desk if fading is difficult. The fit is good. I only have one problem; the friction of a plus girl's thighs wears out the seams LONG before the rest of the jeans. Wouldn't it be great if they could come up with something to either prevent this from happening (most likely impossible) or, at least, slow it down? I got a better price on these, but they're still not cheap by any means. Until the inner thigh becomes threadbare, they're great!"
5,Great Jeans,There are the most comfortable jeans I have ever worn. No matter what your figure these jeans make it look better
5,Ancestors' Path is a wonderful and insightful game,"The Ancestors' Path is a helpful and fun way to consult ""the Oracle"", also instructing and educating the player in understanding the world through the Native American ""looking glass"". The answers to questions about life or any concern at hand will have universal meaning with the lovely flavour of the ancient traditions of this land. I recommend this book and divination game as a splendid gift to give a family member or friend for the Holidays!"
5,Egyptian Masterpieces,This is really a stunning book with lots of color pictures. Many artefacts are shown from several angles. There's precise information about each object given. At the end of each short article there's an extensive list of notes and bibliographic information for further reading.
1,Great film - unwatchable dvd!,"As a lifelong fan of German krimi, I was thoroughly disappointed in the very low quality of print reproduction on this dvd. It is as though someone recorded an analog television broadcast of the film on slow-play video tape, made a copy of that tape on another slow-play tape, and then transferred this second-generation, taped mess straight to dvd without any attempt at resolution or clean-up. Although ""Dead Eyes"" is one of the better films of this genre, I could not bear to watch any more than five minutes of this attractively-packaged garbage. Avoid this piece of crap!!!"
1,O2 sensor,"The code reader indicated O2 sensor was bad,but did not fix the problem. I wonder if I didn't get a bad sensor? Not sure..."
1,badly transfered,"If a studio is going to put out old movies, they should really take the time to remaster the movies. In this case they did not. the sound is almost none existent and the picture is so dark and bright you can hardly watch it. Madacy Studios is not a company to buy movies from. not waste your money and time on this dvd. it is not worth it. there is however another copy from Roan Studios. they know how to present and presever movies."
5,"Djinni, Djinni...come out wherever you are","Excellent book.Monica Jackson is a talented author. She has a skill for creating likeable characters. The djinni, Raziq, nearly leaps off the page in all his sexiness. (Makes you wanna go hunt up your own antique perfume bottle).The scenes where Raziq has to hide Jasmine from the forces of evil inside of a coke can are the best. You truly can viualize the haven he creates for her.This book has it all good versus evil, action adventure, romance, intrigue, mystery, and all the passion you will ever need--you name it and this is the potpourri of romance books.My only complaint: it was too short (210 pages) and that's only because I was not ready to leave Raziq and Jasmine alone.Excellent book. Excellent."
2,NOT FOR HUMID CLIMATE,The T-Fal was fine for about 2 years in the semi-tropics- 70-85F and 70-90& RH. Then the buttons started to require long and hard pressure- finally most of them stopped working. My next unit will have an electronic touch pad- hopefully more protected against high humidity
1,Casio Men's Forester,"Watch design is good and love the world time feature.However, the thermometer is a major disappointment. It did not report the actual temperature of where I am. The surrounding temperature is 0 degrees but it's showing 20; such a vast difference!"
3,Nice but ...,"Everything is good , except for the temp part ( for which i mainly got this one ) does not work accurately ."
2,Thermometer doesn't work,Watch has serious quality issues. Casio's customer service is terrible. A deadly combo.1) Thermometer is a not useful. Temperatures reading is incorrect and it gets worse when you wear it.2) Analog and digital clocks are not synced. Thats OK if both are working fine. Analog clock on mine runs fast. I have to reset it once a week.[...]
1,Therm. does not work and Ugly watch,"First off, it looks nice in the picture but is really ugly in real life. The hour hand has a red color on the tip that is very pronouce. The thermometer sucks big time. When you wear it, the temp increased by about 10 degrees! The instruction says you can calibrate the temp but the calibration is for setting the accuracy of the temperature and does not factor the body temp."
1,Dont buy this watch if you want temperature functions!,"So disappointing. The temperature sensor is in the backing plate which if you are actually wearing the watch, would be next to your skin. Therefore, your body temp skews any temperature reading. When I called Casio to find out if there is a calibration tip to offset the body temperture reading, their suggestion was to take the watch off and let it adjust to the exterior temperature and read it then put the watch back on. That would be real convenient. Even when wearing the watch, it gave me some unknown temperature that neither corresponded to my true body temperature or the air temp. A major disappointment overall even though all of the other features worked fine if you dont mind reading around the watch hands for the digital information. You dont want this watch."
3,Not Bad / Not Great,"Well ... living in Australia has come with sticker shock ... thus most of my purchases now come from Amazon.com. I purchased this watch because I needed a daily rag tag watch. The locals don't seem to mind paying through the nose ... this watch retails here ""down under"" in the $150.00 range ... so at $42xx + shipping it's a relative bargain. However, been for warned, yes this a decent ""little"" watch & I'd have to agree with one other reviewer that, this is a disappointment for being a Casio watch ... it's ""value"" priced, but, it's very cheap looking & very flimsy. Not that it's a complete waste of money ... but I did recently order a Nike Oregon watch, which was less & looks way better as a watch & at least looks & feels like it can take the punishment of a daily watch.Thus 3 starts out 5 ..."
1,Terrible setup for analog hands,"Terrible setup for analog hands. Every time the time needs adjustment, it's a major pain. Practically useless because of that."
2,hard to set features,not user friendly in setting features. very difficult to set temp and day settings. would not recommend
3,Nice watch,It's a nice watch given the price. It never shows temperature properly. It has many features which are not of much use in day-to-day life.
2,Lorus EZ Reader LR 0831,"I bought this watch for my 94 year old mother. She needs a watch with larger numbers and straightforward to read. The face is as described and easier to see and read than many watches. The band was described as ""leather"" in the chart which listed features. That's what I thought it was. In fact, it is man made and very stiff. I can hardly move it and buckle it. My mother needs a new band before she can use it. After it arrived I did recheck the listing once more. Further down, in another part, it says ""man made."" Does that mean real man made leather? NOT! I gave it 2 stars because the face was as expected. It arrived in a timely manner but in a broken plastic case. The piece that the watch sits on within the case was broken. It had to be packed broken because the outer case was not cracked. The band needs replacement. Would I order again from this company? Probably not."
1,"Be warned, this is not a live recording","BE WARNED! If you think this is a video recording of an orchestral performance, you will be sorely disappointed, as I was. It is merely a SOUNDTRACK of Debussy with pretty travelogue visuals glued on. There are NO VISUALS OF THE ORCHESTRA AT ALL, no shots of musicianly craftsmanship, faces concentrating, skilled fingers plucking, lips on the oboe, etc. -- nothing of that. It is merely a travelogue plus audio CD. You may as well play the CD in your car, while driving through your own visuals. For me this Naxos purchase was a total waste."
5,"Roth, distilled to his most powerful essence","Roth fans, students of serious literature, and those interested in a glimpse into the aging male psyche should truly enjoy this gem of a book. Roth proves his stature as one of America's greatest living writers by, in the mere span of roughly 150 large-type pages, offering insights into subjects such as man's intellectual nature versus man's sexual nature, Puritanism, academia and political correctness, the Sixties, marriage and family, mortality, and the randomness of fate. One could go on and on describing the many attributes of this book, but in the spirit of Roth's pithiness, I will just say: ""read it!"""
4,A borrowed idea?,"The Dying Animal (2001) is a good book, indeed. But if you had read ""La Tregua"" (The Truce), from the Uruguayan novelist Mario Benedetti, you'll find both stories amazingly similar. And the latter was published in 1960..."
1,Pretentious,"Whatever Mr. Roth might once have had as an interesting and innovative writer, it's not here. The writing was so trite and the prose so purple I was offended even, and embarrassed for the author."
4,Blackjack,Melodic rock from late 70's featuring lead singer Michael Bolotin (Bolton). Good songs from a great band.
5,Surprisingly Good,What a great book! I didn't expect it to be so good. What I liked best about the book was the variety of leaders and situations Useem wrote about and how each leader's style fit or did not fit into the situations into which they were thrust into. My favorite story was Eugene Kranz'. His optimism and force of personality helped get Apollo 13 back to Earth. A real life hero.
4,Very good,"I won't duplicate what the other reviews state, but will say I recommend this one for sure. Its thematic not strictly chronological, much like Joe Ellis' book on Thomas Jefferson, ""American Sphinx."" Very nicely written, and even after I have read many, many GW books, I still learned some interesting new things about him from Henriques (such as the details about GW & Sally Fairfax, and GW's death.) The one thing the author botches is any discussion on Washington as a Freemason, which was one of the most important things in his life. This should have been expounded upon in the chapter on Washington & religion, but was not. Its certainly not a fatal flaw in this book, but is a glaring omission."
4,Very good review or source,"The book offered a very good review of skills needed to complete the FireFighters Civil Service exam with few errors in the answer sheets; which seem to plague other review books. Some of the material was fairly easy and I would therefore recommend using this book in conjunction with another, namely: Barron's Firefighter Exams 4th edition.I will check back in after the test to update how well I scored."
5,Pizza! Pizza!,Great pan! Durable and well made! I have used it several times with great results. I would definitely suggest this pan!
3,No width and depth,My take from this book is that Mr. Jonathan Kirsch is a professional writer and he wrote a book to make money. His writing is good but dispassionate. For example compare the book with writing of Karen Armstrong. It is like he got an assignment form a writing professor and delivers it high class. But the book has no width and no depth. It describes the fight between paganism and monotheism in Judaism and Christianity and nowhere else (except some story about Akhenaton in ancient Egypt.) There is no analysis. It elaborates a lot about lives of Constantine and Julian which maybe interesting but not really relevant to the subject.
5,Great Pan,In my house I use this pan more for baking chicken than I do for cakes. It cleans up pretty easily and only has a few baked on stains around the rubber handles. I would definitely buy this pan again.
1,misleading info,"since oldies music has become popular, there has been a rise in compilation albums produced to fill that need. Twice now I have made CD purchases based on (this)website's misleading info. In this set of CDs there are no original artists. That fact shouldbe clearly labeled in website info. Now I suggest making clear to the customer original material vs ? material."
3,"Pleasant, for a while","This is relaxing and pleasant music to put in your CD player on occassion.My problem with this genre of music, however, is that it just all starts sounding exactly the same to me after a while. This album could just as well be one long, long song, for the amount of variety there is on it.Then again, if it's Celtic harp music you want, it's Celtic harp music you've got. You could do much worse than this."
2,Disappointing,"The author, Dr. Rita Louise, does not include anything that one cannot find in other books which are better written. Keep looking. This book will disappoint."
2,Dissapointed,Too basic and leaves some gaps on some important detail. Takes a lot of words to say simple things. Better info available on utube
5,Solid Workout,"This workout has good instruction and is suitable for beginner to intermediate exercisers. I found the hosts easy to follow and helpful and thought the workout was good. I do all three segments together for a workout that's about 50 minutes. And there's a play all, and the ability to mix and match the segments. There's also an Ab workout available online. I wish they had put that on the DVD as it's well executed.It's a mix of cardio and resistance exercises, nothing new or fancy, but well cued and useful."
4,"Surprise, a small, thin book about larger-than-life Taylor","This is not bad, considering it is too small and thin to be truly comprehensive. The author has definite opinions, some I agree with, others not altogether. But he has an interesting take on things. The book supports my contention that Taylor will remain an eternally-fascinating creature.There are very good black and white photos of Taylor, some featuring her with actors I like, like Vittorio Gassman, John Ericson, and Spencer Tracy, and of course Montgomery Clift.If you are looking for a true biography, this does not fill the bill, but it would supplement other books on Taylor nicely."
1,Very Misleading Book,"There is much wisdom to be gained from Aboriginal culture, but the ""wisdom"" in this book is NOT Aboriginal, but rather made up by the author. She should have based her book on real Aborigines and shared their true culture, or based it on a totally fictional population. That way readers would not believe the lies she tells about Australia. The book does make one think about the many flaws of our western culture which is good, but to do so while corrupting a native culture is simply appalling. She should not be profiting from this book."
3,"Staight forward, fast and enjoyable read","An very enjoyable read. Please not that the author states in the first pages of the book that this story is fiction, so I don't understand how other people are so upset that 'she has written a pack of lies...'So she has created a beautiful story that reminds us to look within and to take care of our planet. She presents the message very colourful which motivates to be more concious of who we are and what we do."
4,Inspiring if you dare,I really liked the book and the found the simple truths to reinforce my own personal beliefs. I am amazed at some of the negative reaction to such a positive message. How on earth could this book be seen as threatening but then again human's are like a rope......G-d pulling on one end and the devil on the other.
1,Total Fantasy - not based in fact.,"Please, if you read this book (and I recommend that you DO NOT) consider it complete fantasy. Yes, it has been labled as ""fiction"", but the author claims it is based on her actual experience. Google her name, or the book title, and read the controversy surrounding this book.Aside from the controversy, it is poorly written, and the author's racist language is offensive. Don't buy it, and don't read it."
2,pure fantasy,If you are looking for insight into the world view of aboriginal people this is not the book to read.If you are looking for a poorly written but enjoyable light fantasy this is your slice of pie.
3,Mutant Message Down Under,"This book was recommended by a friend. I must admit that I was a bit disappointed. If you don't take the story seriously, it is an interesting read. However, it is unfortunate that Marlo Morgan didn't take the time to research the indigenous people of Australia. They are nothing like our Native Americans. I researched the author, and the controversy surrounding her is more enticing than the book!"
1,Taken in ........ but only for awhile,"I recently checked this book on tape out of our local library, listening intently as I drove through the countryside.Seemingly implausible at the start, I found myself taken in by the message of ""the real people"" who live off the land, healing with plants, using senses other than the commonly known five in order to make their way through the outback of Australia ..... and on and on. Indeed, it is a fantastic tale.However, the last line of the edition to which I listened summed up the entire book for me as far as the ""truth or fiction"" question is concerned. The very final words are that the author had learned to use (among other things) the ""magic of illusion."" In the instant that I heard those words I realized the author had just described the nature of her writing. One hundred percent illusion.A poorly written, fantastic tale? Yes. An illusion? Even moreso!"
5,Book's theme is right on,"The ""message"" of this book calls us to examine the western culture we have created and decide if it really does bring happiness. The author thinks not, and in her story submerges an American in an Aboriginal culture for 3 months to show the differences. The story is fascinating, and the conclusion is that the indigenous culture providing for peoples' emotional needs above physical needs, whereas our western culture is just the opposite. There was criticism when this book was published that many of the facts about the lives of the Aborigines were erroneous, but the book is fiction. I am sure the author made up a lot of the details and since it's fiction that's fine. Making a factual account of a 3 month walkabout was not the claim of the book - comparing two radically different social environments and drawing conclusions from that comparison was the intent. Very thought provoking; I highly recommend it to any socially aware reader."
4,We are the primitive mutants,"This book is a beautiful insight and tribute to the Australian Aboriginal way of life. As an Australian who currently lives in the United States, the book enriched my pride and appreciation for the great natives of my land. The book also provided me with feelings of sadness - sadness that this world is so blind that it can no longer be a home for the ""real people"". The strongest message I derived from the book was that we are the primitive mutants who have lost our direction in life to the forces of busy-ness, wealth and technological advancement. And we have lost the ability to communicate and heal and identify with our inner selves - reading this book was in many ways a harsh awakening to the meaningless realities of our backward society."
1,Insipid New Age Drivel,"This book is awful. It's shallow, condescending and ultimately ridiculous. Reading this book may even lower your IQ. Don't believe me? Read some of the reviews praising this rubbish."
5,Amazing,"This book is powerful, it made me question everything in my life. When i first saw it I thought, whhy would i want to read a book about Aborigines? I thought it would be some textbook type book, but it was an amazing story - incaptivating as Harry Potter, but so much more meaningful. Also-it's true. I highly recommend it."
2,Aborigines want bes - seller ban- mutant message,"http://xp3.dejanews.com/getdoc.xp?recnum""It is hoped by me that each and every one of you Spiritual Elders will be able to support in whatever way you can. It is to deal with our Indigenous Ancient Living Culture and how this woman, Marlo Morgan of America, a white woman, from Kansas City, is trying to destroy it through her book 'Mutant Message Dwonunder' and through her lecture tours over the US, Europe and parts of the world. It is through the eruption of Marlo exploiting our Culture and our Blackfella Religion and our Sense of Belonging that our Elders and People Australia-wide have become deeply concerned with this issue. Marlo Morgan is becoming a rich woman overnight and telling liew about our Beliefs and culture.Contact: The Swan Valley Nyungah Communityc/o Post Office, Guildford 6055 Western AustraliaFax:011619 377 3559 or Patricia Friedel 415 673 9102This woman deceived us all!"
1,This book was terrible,"This book was terrible, completely devoid of any worthwhile content, and probably a complete hoax or fabrication. The voice is that of someone who is morally sermonizing but unless the reader is completely ignorant, the author comes across as being no more enlightened than a small child who has just begun having their first thoughts regarding the meaning of life. Do not bother reading this book. You can gain much more by reading any of Dr Suess's fine works."
1,Negative Star!,"I just cannot read on anymore! This woman writes as well as a high school student trying to finagle an A out of her Supposed Writing class. I spent years trying not to produce writings like that and here it is, an entire 187 pages of it...My problem is now facing the person who gave me this book; she is expecting some kind of praise from me. The author not actually being a high school student makes it an extremely difficult task."
1,Somewhat unbelievable,"My book group read this book. Half really liked it and half really hated it. The author, since writing this book, has found herself in a great deal of controversy regarding her creditability. One person in my group said she felt that this book ""changed her"". I felt that the whole book was highly implausible. It is a good book for a book group in that it generated a lot of discussion."
1,what a load of horse hockey,"I read this book ten years ago and am ashamed to admit it. It was so very obviously a new age fantasy novel masquerading as truth or near-truth, that to finish the entire book was an exercise in self-deceit. Enough reviewers have produced salient points to this effect that I submit this review only to add one more point that has been overlooked by those unfamiliar with its source.Margo Morgan quotes an aboriginal with a sort of poem or statement about clouds and coming and going that is a verbatim plagarism of a mostly obscure poem by Seung Sahn Sunim, a Korean Zen master. It has been ten years, so I won't attempt the quote myself, but the memory of her blatant dishonesty saddens me to this day."
2,Interesting But.....A Fairy Tale/Hoax,"My wife, a Holistic Healer, is totally enamoured with this book and it's ""lessons"" of life, living and healing.After reading it, I looked for more info about the author. Wow, the whole book is apparently a fabricatation to make money and/or advance the ideals of New Age spirituality.If I had known it was untrue from the beginning, I probably would have enjoyed it for what it was, a story about living in the desert and native ideas of living, one with the earth. However, I feel I wasted a lot of emotion believing her adventures were mostly true experiences. I had doubts numerous times about the truthfulness of experiences she described. She covers for that possibility by claiming in her Forward that the book was a ""fictionalized"" account to protect the tribe,it's members and their location.I give it 2 stars because it was an interesting read about living in the outback, and about spiritual beliefs even if her story has turned out to be totally untrue."
4,Mutant message down under,"Easy read. It makes you reflect on your choices, your impact on the environment, the effect your choices have on the people you care most about, and rethink what is important to value in your life."
4,Timeline,"If you noticed that those who ""booed"" this book wrote thier reviews in 2001 through 2004. In a period of three short years, people are taking a closer look at different philosophies of spirituality. I for one found this book inspirational and it was highly recommended to me by a group of people who are on a spiritual path."
1,This book bored me to tears!,"I read this book for my reading group. A woman suggested it and said it was her favorite book. I kept reading and reading, waiting for it to get better, but alas it did not. I have read other books on indigenous tribes that were real, honest and inspiring. This did nothing for me and was a waste of my time."
1,Read Proverbs!,"""Charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting, but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised."" Proverbs 31:30I have not read this book, but based on the basic ideas of this book and other people's reviews I think you'd be better off saving you money and reading the bible with your daughter. What is more important, her outward appearance and manner or her relationship with God?"
3,This movie is nothing special!,"The title of this movie is Justin Bieber ""Never Say Never"". This is such a lie because I heard him say Never so many times that it's not even funny!"
3,premiere for XP,"the wrigley tutorial page has moved.try: http://www.wrigleyvideo.com/videotutorial/and go from there, or try wrigley's home page.As far as Premiere goes, it's like most Adobe products: expensive compared to competing products, overkill software engineering, a hog on RAM resources, but you can do a lot with it once you get past the (steep) learning curve."
2,Looks good but,This is a watch I thought looked goodand in that regard it worksBut difficult to set and I would notbuy another oneI also had major delivery problems albeitI payed for speedAmazon refunded that portion of my paymentNot sure I would use Amazon again
3,Watch band too short,"So far this watch seems to be as durable as my last G shock which has lasted more than 5 years. It was replaced only because the watch band gave out in the end and a new one seemed to be cheap. Mind you I've only had it a few weeks.The main problem with this one is that the watch band is annoyingly short. It's more than 1.5 inches shorter than my earlier model, and barely suitable for an average man's wrist.Casio have economized in the wrong area here, in my opinion."
5,Great Watch,I love this Watch. I have it on right now. Great deal!! Win win win. A must have for any guy
5,Best Watch Ever,Hey It might not be as flashy as the other colors that every hipster is wearing but it is a GShock and it is a very reliable watch. I dont know how many minutes it looses per year or whatever but it is a very sturdy watch. I bought this watch in the middle of last year and there is not a scratch on it. I usually get watches and the screen gets messed up and the band changes colors but not this one. This watch here is a winner in all categories and it at a great price for what you are getting here. Don't believe me just compare the prices or try to go to the mall and find an AUTHENTIC one for cheaper. I bet you wont find one. But this is a great watch and can go with anything you wear unless you going for an all white look even white shoes lol but I would recommend this to a friend hell I would even buy one for a friend.
1,the date and year won't be shown clearly,It is cheep so is the product. some of the number don't show. The one I got didn't have half of the number of the date and year. It looks cheep too. Very disapointed.
3,Casio dw9-052,"It doesnt seem to look as good as the picture but casio is casdio. You get a reasonably accurate watch for a great price.It doesnt seem good for the office though, it looks a little to wild but okay outside of work for most things I go to."
1,Junk,"Casio Men's DW9052-1V G-Shock Classic Digital WatchThe day and date never change, so although it keeps good time, you never know what day or date it is. I really wasted my money on this one."
1,WHERE IS MY PRODUCT???,"I could rate the product, but honestly, I NEVER GOT IT!!! I am beyond upset, as this watched cost me more than I was originally willing to spend. VERY UPSET and DISAPOINTED!!!"
2,Not so tough,Mine was dead in 18 months after washing my hands with it. Not so water resistant as advertised.
1,the worst sas book I have read,"bought this book based on the title and the reviews from other buyers. I was shocked when I got the book and started to read it. it is not a book about efficient sas processing for any people who even has only entry level sas experience. it does not have any valuable contents, and some pages have missing letters or words. I went through the book in 10 mins. bad quality overall. do not spend any money more than $1.00 for it."
2,A gripping but vacuous account of NYC nightlife,"James St. James has a lot of good stories to tell, but his immature and self-indulgent prose keeps them from ever being anything more than five-year old gossip. The sad thing is some parts of this book are very gripping; ravers will be interested to hear about superstar DJ Keoki's early years, and St. James paints a picture of a K-Hole that will make anyone who's ever been there feel ill. This is all buried, however, beneath a mountain of affectations and arbitrary type faces."
4,Almost too bizarre to believe.,"After watching the movie with McCauley Culkin and Seth Green, I read the book. Loved it! James St. James tells this sordid story with humor and style."
3,OK Job,"my friends and I were entrenched in this scene at a midway point in the late '80s- before it got into the dark and ugly Disco 2000 phase. There was a lot of fun and drugs to be had. I feel lucky that we got out relatively unscathed. James does a good job of whimsically and comically describing the goings on, but his self-absorption, hypocrisy and insane vanity comes through as well"
5,Class DVD production of Euro 2004,"I've purchased many of the Reedswain VHSs and DVDs over the years and picked this one up as well. This is the best so far. Excellent picture quality which has been lacking in the past especially for as much as these babies cost. Excellent camera work and commentating, a little too bad this particular tourney turned into Greek robo defensive mode in the last few rounds but hey its fun to root for the underdog right? sorta? Anyways, if you're as much of a junkie for the international tournaments as I am, this ones simply essential, in fact I've had to buy mine twice, because of theft, so thats 60 bucks. If thats not an endorsement I don't know what is."
5,"little budget, big story","I saw this movie at the new york film festivals and it's great. Intriguing story, strong characters, beautiful film...and all on a shoestring budget. In fact, I read that Rod Lurie, the director of last year's hit ""The Contender,"" really liked it too. don't miss this well-crafted suspense drama."
2,Waiting for Snow in Havana,"Could not finish this one.......the author rambles, going back and forth too much. I could not keep up with which country he was in....."
2,bitter book,"I have never read a book in which the author so liberally condemned people to hell. I found the author's mightier-than-thou heavy-handed and oppressive. This is a work of anger and hatred rather than a full picture of a country. I hope that anybody who reads this book realizes how slanted Carlos Eire's words are. I just returned from four months in Cuba, no, things aren't perfect, but it isn't the oppressive purgatory that Eire would have youo believe."
5,Great service and quick delivery,Great price and in great condition. Arrived earlier than expected. Will enjoy it for years to come. Thanks for the great service.
1,too much about too little,"This might be a good family memoir but to subject readers to details and more details of the antics of naughty little rich boys is beyond the pale. Was this book edited? It could have been tightened up and shortened considerably. Details about Batista and Castro were sparse so as history this book fell short. As I read, I often checked to see just how much more I had to read in order to finish and be done. It was well but too much written. I would suggest that the author suffers from the same malady as his father, extreme narcissism."
5,All Hail the Mighty Diamond Head!,"This band was one of the handful at the time that had the DIY aesthetic punk rockers had. Don't wait for labels to come running with cash in the fist promising tours, etc. Put it out yourself! And that's what they did. What they didn't count on was becoming one of the biggest to break out of the NWOBHM movement. These guys were more known than Maiden at the time and influenced Metallica in many ways. All i can say is buy it, you wont be disapointed! Tracks I like are ""It's Elecric"",""Helpless"" ""Am I Evil?"", ""Sucking My Love"", and ""The Prince"". Brian Tatler is THE MAN."
5,So delicious,"It's hard to find in stores so I have to resort to ordering online but it's well worth it. The taste is so unique & after you try it, I doubt you'll go back to regular taco seasonings. I love that they add raisins to it. Nice touch."
5,Yumm!,"This is the best taco mix ""North of the Border""! I travel to Mexico very frequently and recognize good authentic Mexican taste. This Chipotle Taco Mix by Nueva Cocina is simply the easiest and the best."
3,vague client stories,"He presents some very interesting theories, but unfortunately the briefness and honestly, the vagueness of his recounting of the clients/patients' experiences leave me feeling like he's goofing off"
1,Very Slow and Boring,I watched this movie based on all the great reviews it got here and I was very disappointed. I just didn't find it very interesting. I though it was rather dull and boring. Throughout the moie the police are looking for a killer....they never really catch him and when they do think they know who it is there is doubt. I don't mind a movie that keeps the viewer wondering but the movie didn't seem to progress much at all.
1,Not to spec,"I ordered 2 of these, realizing they would have limited adjustment range - other reviews are correct in that they are very limited in their travel. What prompts my one star rating and subsequent return of my order is that they will not hold their rated weight. This model is supposed to hold a 25 lb. monitor; it failed miserably at attempting to hold my 23 lb. iMac. There is no tension adjustment (already as tight as it would go) and the computer just flopped forward. With a light monitor, I'm sure it would be fine, but don't expect even close to the stated 25 lb. rating."
1,La Antorcha Encendida,"Es una lastima que una novela como esta,con tan buenos actores y actrices en su reparto,y basado en un hecho real de tanta tracendencia para la historia de Mexico y realizada en el propio Mexico,le hayan dado un final tan malo,no tiene final.Que dececcion despues de dedicar tantas horas de mi tiempo,es el peor resumen de novela que he visto en mi vida"
1,...AND THEN??? (Y???).,"Y que es lo que Televisa desea?... que uno forme su propia conclusion al final o que?? La produccion muy irresponsable porque esta obra queda totalmente inconclusa y parece no preocuparles a pesar de nustros comentarios.Que lastima!Aunque increible el reparto de actores y actuaciones, tanto en lo ficticiocomo los acontecimientos historicos de nuestro Mexico y su independencia."
2,NO ENDING!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Very disappointed in this production by televisa.I watched this for many hours only to find out that their is no ending.At first I thought maybe a disk was missing.This is ridiculous,how can somebody put something out that its incomplete.The acting and storyline was great that is the only reason why I give it 2 stars."
1,TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED,"What happened to the ending?. How can they possible do something so low as to release a product that takes 20 hrs to watch only to discover that it is imcomplete.Five stars to the actors the director, set designers etc.ZERO!!!!!!! to who ever decided to release it in this mannerI see comments from October 2010, I bought mine 2-3 years ago, can it be that Amazon is stil swindling people with this product!!!"
3,It is not closed captioned,"I was disappointed to find that this telenovela is not closed captioned like the ad says. Unfortunatley, that was the main reason I ordered it, so that I could read it in Spanish."
2,Rust is the word,If you expect these chrome shelves to look good in your kitchen or bathroom guess again. I love these shelves however they rusted almost instantly. Very unfortunate because they are stylish and just the right size. I would buy them again if they were rust proofed but until then you are just throwing your money away.
4,Maybe manufacturer has changed?,"I picked up 2 of these shelves at Target about 5 or 6 years ago for the kitchen and I've never had any rust problems. They've held (at various houses), tea canisters in the kitchen, washcloths and cosmetics in the bathroom, plastic bags & wrap in the pantry, and now they're back holding tea in the kitchen. I'm wondering if the new sets are manufactured differently (cheaply, let's just say it), so now they rust. I'm rethinking ordering another set now that I've seen there's a problem with them."
3,ok,I bought this for all of my perfume bottles. It is stylish and what I wanted but the wires are pretty far apart and makes it hard for my perfume to stand on it. It does work if I place the bottles just right but any small move will nock them ok. Good product but not for perfume bottles.
3,okay,"this product shows it can hold a lot of stuffs even bigger stuffs like mixer, bowels and more , it shows on the outer box that it was big but it is four times smaller , that shocks me ! lol"
3,"Tiny, Shoddy manufacturing","Firstly, the factory images are highly misleading - they use miniature toy mugs on the box pictures to make it look bigger. (please see the image I added to get an idea of the size of this thing)Secondly, the build quality is mediocre- the shelf end bar welds were not all the same height relative to the cone-shaped corner mounts leaving the entire shelf uneven at it's base. Plus, several of the welds did not cross the seam on the corner mounts - though I was able to stand on the edges and it didn't break."
1,No weight. Needs to be bolted down.,This stand is weightless and will move around and tip over easily. It needs to be fastened to something to be of any use.
3,Does what it's supposed to,"This holder is a decent piece of equipment... nothing fancy, nothing over the top. If I were to complain, it would be to wish the spring was a little stronger. My iron is on the heavy side, which causes the spring to droop. However, for the price, I can't complain at all."
4,Decent holder,"I bought this for my husband, who would leave his iron laying on the table. The sponge is pretty thin, but overall a good product for the price."
5,Jay and Grant do it again,Best box set of the series yet. IM a huge serial killer fan and the Manson Murders were the best one for me. I highly recommend Ghost Hunters.
3,glitch in the dvd?,I bought this DVD and returned it to Best Buy four times because there's a glitch on the first and third disc. I've played it on multiple players and it seems to freeze up on the exact same spots each time.I've been searching around amazon & the TAPS message board to see if anybody else experienced this and have come up empty handed. Has this happened to anyone else?
5,Ghost Hunter Season 3 part 2,"This was so far the best season all together but part 2 was better than part 1. It seems to me that TAPS is getting more money in and can now pay for more equipment and go alot more places. The only issue I could have in the future is if TAPS decides to go ""Hollywood"" meaning they are only going to do investigations for money, that worries me because this has always been an authentic series. This is ironic because they said they dont charge people for their investigations. Regardless, this is a great series and is so far alot more believable than any other ghost hunting team you will find. This is a must see, I own every season and the single investigations. Enjoy."
4,Interesting,"I was surprised at how frightened the guys got in a Northern Nevada hotel. I wasn't there, so it's difficult to assess just how spooky a place is, but I thought these guys were not afraid of ghosts. Worth Watching."
1,WORST CARPENTER MOVIE,"The ideas aren't really that bad, but in my oppinion this movie is very badly made. The scenes are crappy and the movie is nor spooky nor gory.Just crap in my eyes - NO ENTERTAINMENT"
4,Great Collection,"Pretty cheap selection of B movie flare by a great film maker. With the exception of The Thing, these film's are not among Carpenter's best, and generally represent a string of low budget films he did at Universal. There are no special features and there are two films on each disc which is one sided. I have since bought the Thing on Blu Ray for picture quality and features, but the rest I am content with a simple DVD version, though They Live is coming to Blu Ray soon. Village of the Damned and Prince of Darkness are among his worse films but I still get a kick out of them. I'm glad this was an option to obtain these films for a cheap price and glad to have the Thing on DVD to travel with so it plays on my laptop."
4,Misunderstood Classic John Carpenter!!,"OK this isn't his best film but it has an awesome cast, I mean Alice Cooper and an interesting take on the Apocalypse, if your a JC fan you should add this to your Library."
5,Excellent!,"This is a very scary movie. Not as good as Halloween or The Fog, but it is a good one and shouldn't be missed. Sure it's a little hokey and cheezy in parts, but overall this is a pretty chilling movie that is seriously underated. This is one you must watch alone in the dark."
3,Low Budget Fun,"John Carpenter was on somewhat of a roll when he helmed Prince of Darkness. He achieved cult status with the Cynical ""Escape From New York"", the Groundbreaking ""Halloween"", the Campy ""Big Trouble in Little China"" and the Gory ""The Thing"".Here he tries his luck with Satan himself, creating a facinating world with the mysterious cannister, the Brotherhood of Sleep, a Supernova signalling the End of Man as well a book written by the son of Lucifer himself. While his vision is good, unfortunately the budget cannot keep up. The minions of evil are relegated to Bums and Homeless people, which makes Satan look a little wimpy. Also the story about the future broadcast, while creating some atmospheric suspense, is not integrated well into the plot.Still the movie is a worthy effort, while not as good as previous efforts (try ""The Fog"", an excellent movie) it is good. I guess the best recommendation I can make for it is that I liked it enough to buy it for my own collection (DVD of course)."
5,Why all the poor reviews?,"This movie rox. No it's not as good as some of Carpenter's films, but it still rulez!"
1,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"John Carpenter remakes yet another classic horror movie and again it just doesn't work. When you take a movie based on one that is 35 years old, coming from a book that's even older than that, and you try to adapt it to modern day life, something is going to be off. If it had been set in the time it was written, it would have made more sense, but would still have been a pretty weak story. A massive blackout impregnates the town woman with alien children who can see your thoughts and force you to do what they wish. It's not the best story to begin with. Add to that a group of actors who are passed their prime and really don't want to be doing this film and you get another s*** movie that is basically a waste of time."
3,Not bad or good. Just ok.,"In Midwich, all of the town's women have suddenly become pregnant at the same time. I realize that this is entirely possible, but extremely unlikely. Whatever. The weirder event is when all the women give birth simultaneously. All of the children posses a frightening appearance, and a much more frightening agenda. They seem to want all the adults dead. What must be done to stop the evil from winning?This film isn't very memorable. The acting, story, drama, and dialogue are all completely mediocre. I can't recommend buying this DVD. The best I can do is tell you that it's an ok rental. If you're alone, bored and have seen everything else the store has in stock. That's about it."
4,"Someone should slap a big ol' ""Satan"" label on that jar.","Carpenter certainly knows how to set the mood. Artistic combination of soundtrack and story. Loses only one star for very minor storyline haze, but all in all, a fun and spooky time. Creepy folks and special effects. For even more fun, buy some of that green ""slime"" they sell in novelty stores and huck it on your buddies in the middle the movie... They'll love that."
3,Related to Mary Baker Eddy?,"There are some good points and ideas in this book, but it seems very similar to Christian Science. However, it's great that Kessinger still prints this and other hard to find religious titles."
5,A gift for my son,Purchased this item for my 12 year old son who had informed me that these watches are what everybody is wearing in school. I had a similar G-shock way back when as well. This model is a perfect size for children in his age range. Many G-shocks are are over sized for a man's wrist. This was a perfect fit!
3,g shock review,this watch looks fake its painted on if you wright with it on the layer of paint comes off and looks bad its good over all looks great the back part that keeps it on your wrist is plastic it looks cheap over all its worth the money i say but its not a real g shock and dont wear it when u wright or the paint will ware off evry quick i have had mine for 2 days and it already started
4,Keeping It Simple,"I had wanted another round-faced Casio G-Shock for quite a while, but kept getting other similar but inferior sport watches for gifts and couldn't justify the extra watch. I finally broke down when I could not silence the alarm on the Timex that was aging. The styling is fine. The time display is smaller than I would prefer, but I was unwilling to pay the extra retail for the more classic G-Shock. My use of the watch is simple: time, stopwatch and splits and the occasional alarm function. I anticipate that I will replace the band (in 2-3 years) before I have to replace the timepiece."
5,A true guys watch,"So I wanted a nice watch that I can take to work, to workout, swimming, etc. I swam in a saltwater pool, and I made it a point to see if the light works under water and it definatly does."
5,Great watch,This watch is the best I been in the marines for 4 years and it is still going never any problems work around salt water every day no corrosion at all very impressed
5,Excellent quality product.,"Excellent quality product. I thought it was great when I had it but it was not, I really like and I know from experience the durability Excellent quality product. I thought it was great when I had it but it was not, I really like and I know from experience the durability I hope this is equal."
4,Smells Great,I love this product. Tha scent lasts all day and my sons still smell good after playing outside. Im going to buy more.
3,question,um im glad you ladies are all satisfied with the product... is it just for ladies though? i mean what about it makes it a women's bag as opposed to a unisex? because i like them! haha
1,A Simple Introduction to a Very Simple Man,"The irony at work in this ""for beginners"" series is intensely gratifying to observe. The pauper heirs of 1968 intentionally encoded their ideologies in needlessly complex language. Their intent in this was to create a self-verifying ideological elite, and to limit their own accountability to those who had the intestinal fortitude and free time to decipher their blather. Nothing Chomsky says couldn't be said more simply, but then he'd lose his gnostic appeal.Of course such obfuscating misfired. Otherwise, why else would these patently insulting and patronizing booklings have arisen? I hope they sell by the millions, for they speak loudly of the failure of Chomsky, Kristeva, Derrida et al. to be comprehensible or relevant to anyone but themselves."
3,Could be Better,"For as expensive as seemingly nothing but a small bag, I'd expect a little more. The side pockets make it bulgy when you actually use them to store video cables or anything else. It should be more padded or at least have bigger outer pockets.It works, but is overpriced for what it offers. Then again, all carry cases are overpriced."
2,DVD Case,Product not quite as described. Doesn't have the space/pockets for the accessories that came with dvd player. My husband and I were somewhat disappointed.
4,Sailor Moon R,"This is the 1st season (of 2) of sailor moon R. This tape was okay. Nothing great, but it did have one of my favorite episodes from SMR, VR madness. Darien actually starts acting almost nice to Serena. One thought I'd like to throw out here, why is it that Darien and Serena can only fall in love when he remembers their past(Princess and knight past)? If they're really in love, they should be able to love each other without those super old memories, right? Ah well. I think Super S is the best SM saga, anyway. Can't wait for that! But Doom Tree saga is good too. I hope they dub Stars! The manga was soooo good. Back to the point, though. This tape was good, so you should buy it. I also recommend Sailor Moon S and SuperS, and deffinitely the manga."
4,Beautiful as display,"This is a beautiful mortar and pestle it is heavy. I had it on display on the counter top but then decided to use it and after that the pestle lost its shiny color now it is a dull dusty gray. The mortar remains dark shiny grey on the outside but the inside is dull gray.This mortar and pestle requires a lot of muscle power but you can crush about anything.The only thing I did not like was how the pestle changed into a dull color,that doesn't match the mortar."
4,Great Product and a Great Value,"This mortar and pestle turned out to be very good. I ordered it for my girlfriend because i knew she wanted one for a while, while looking at the various ones available I noticed that there is no set price and they range from $5 - $50. Not knowing if any one is better than the other I decided to give this a try, it turned out to be great. My girlfriend loves it and it was shipped very quickly."
5,ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!!,"This piece looked exactly as the photo, absolutely beautiful! The asking price made this an absolute steel and I plan to order yet another one come October. The item arrived earlier then the promised date and I couldn't have been more pleased with the service, or the item itself!"
5,Great looking piece,"This arrived and was just what I was hoping for. It looks great and works very well for making guacamole. It is pretty heavy so I will need to add some kind of padding to the bottom to keep it on our quartz countertops, but this piece is worth the price."
5,"It doesn't look like the picture, but it is HEAVY!","All the other reviews are spot on. This sucker is heavy. The pestle (handle) is not dipped in something to make it black like it looks in the picture. It is simply the same material as the mortar.The outside of the mortar, however, is coated with some form of sealer.I had a friend tell me he had a Christmas present for me picked out and purchased, but didn't tell me what it was. He came over one day when i had this monster on the counter and told me that he had picked out a much, much smaller one.If you cook, I mean _really_ cook, this is a joy to have up on your counter. It is so nice that you want to find a way to use it! Do you need 3 cup capacity? Probably not. You could get by any number of ways. You've been getting by so far, right?The nice thing, as is true with any quality possession, is that you have the choice. And yes, this sucker is nice and heavy! :)"
5,Great Service,"Great service quick shipping, if you order through the companies web site you will save $10.00"
5,Great looking M n P,"Heavy, but looks nice! Definitely can be used as kitchen decore if you wish or can be stored away until use. Haven't seen it used yet because I gave it as a gift."
4,Granite Mortar & pestle,Product was as described. I haven't used it much yet. The one thing I wanted it for was to grind dried chile pods. Doesn't work good for that. I do plan on trying it out on salsa soon. I'm sure I'll find more uses for it once I think about it.
5,Works Great,"I've been using this for my inline fan for over a month now, in the lower middle range my fan does exactly what I wanted it to do and it made it much more quiet."
5,does what it says,"works great Handles 15 amps. You could hook up a 6-strip and controller many devices (obviously same setting) with one fan controller. I only used it on fans, not sure how it works with lights."
1,"Total Junk, Zero Stars, For tools, not fans.","WHAT I RECEIVED IS NOT PICTURED. I GOT A CHEAP KNOCK OFF VERSION, IT DOES NOT SAY ""THE SPEEDSTER"" IN THE MIDDLE, ITS BLANK GREY. ALSO this item came used. Has scratches, dents and old tape adhesive on the front. Didn't really change any speed on the fan I purchased so I'm using it as an extension cord with a fuse till I get a speed variable fan. Seller is not honest on the description might not sell you a new product. Oh and you can only leave seller feed back once, and you can't edit it, or get it back once you remove it. That makes perfect sense. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT/SELLER. Banged up product and no receipt, this purchase was sketchy and not what I intended. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT/SELLER. Getting a return/refund, this is a JOKE."
1,Buyer Beware!,"I received my Speed Controller today. It has defintely been used! Scratches/dents throughout, no box and no instructions! What makes me even more upset that the lifespan of this device will more than likely run its course sooner than later!This company reminds me of the old school ebay days! Friggin so mad about this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Adequate,"Does the job of a growth chart that is not going to destroy your walls, but my 2 year old picks at it constantly and has already destroyed or lost most of the little flags and accessories that came with it."
1,Pass on this one,"I bought this DVD for $10 Australian dollars which would be about $US6, and I wouldn't pay anymore than that.I won't rubbish the documentary too much, but, it is pretty bad.I'm guessing they didn't have the biggest budget hence the dodgy editing, camera work and bad story telling in general (okay, maybe I am rubbishing it just a bit), but it could have been a LOT better.If you had people like Keith Morris, Jack Grisham, Jello Biafra, Duane Peters etc, you would figure they would have something interesting to say, but they seem to just bore everyone. Not that they were boring, but that this was edited really badly and had no structure. The interviewer butting every few seconds does not help either.I pressed the fast forward button for about 90% of it. Disappointing."
2,Raged about Purchasing,"Nat young took credit for writing this book! It was a bunch of stories written by others who have experienced surf rage. Nat's input was minimal and useless to draw attention to a sad situation he provoked. Sorry it happened. Most avid surfers have experienced some form of rage in the water and certainly don't need to waste time reading tale after tale of violence. Beginning surfers simply need to learn surfing in uncrowded areas and know their limitations. It is unnecessary to read this book to have that understanding. Surfers that indulge in this senseless behavior however would get a morbid kick out of this book. Upon completion I did however recall the subliminal message, avoid crowded Cali and Aussie surf. Thanks Nat, but spare me a sequel."
3,Prefer the T-Shirt,"I bought a long sleeve and a t-shirt from this brand Artiga. The long sleeve I found too tight at the wrist while the body was perfect, not too loose not too tight and the length was perfect to just cover my butt =). The collar was also too tight, but I'm sure with time and useage it'll start to loosen up. Material was nice, not 100% cotton but still smooth and thick enough. I would probably buy it again but go up a size. I usually buy Large anyways but decided to try Medium since I'll be wearing a t-shirt over the long sleeve and didn't want to be too bulky."
3,Neck too tight for me,"The quality of the cloth and the fit was fine, but I wanted it for sleepwear and I gave both shirts away because I personally found the neck too tight."
1,This is a Romance novel?,I could have really liked this book the back of the book sounded really good but the beginning part where Sebastian forces Lara to marry him against her will and force her to consumate the marriage all on the orders of his king in order to prove that the castle is under his control if Lara doesn't she will be murdered along with her brother and sister. That really ends the book for me. The author can dress it up all she wants but what it is rape. Which is not only disgusting to read its even more disgusting to find it in a romance novel where the heroine is raped by the hero. I mean are you kidding me? And this is a romance novel? The author expects me to root for Lara too live happily ever after with the man who raped her? Skip this book.
3,Deadly encounters,Akito finds himself the object of a romantic rivalry between Yurika and Megumi as the crew of the Nadesico must fight battle after battle defending Earth. An encounter with a mysterious girl almost leads to tragedy as Akito and the Aestivalis team must take on a new and even more deadly form of Jovian fighter!This was a real funny episode from the previous 3.
2,Nadesico's continuation encompasses waning skill ...,"I tried one more tape in the hope of finding the enthusiasm for this series other viewers have. All I see is sloppy film work, inconsistant drawing proficiency, transparent and unmotivated plot 'twists' and uninteresting character development. The sexy female characters seem less and less sexy since the poses have become less natural. Oh boy...this series is far from excellent anime, and is having trouble being watchable compared to other anime series."
4,This series is like wine. It gets better with time!,"Okay, at first, this series totally disgusted me. I bought the first tape, curiously, with no knowledge of what it contained. My first impression, a bunch of whinny loud mouth idiots (to quote Ruri :). It seemed to be a bad EVA clone. For some odd reason, however, I went out and bought the next two tapes. Thank God I did! After I finished watching the second tape I was dying to watch the 3rd, and now I'm desperate to go and purchase the next 2 as well! This series got so much deeper. I no longer consider it a bad EVA clone. It's is not like EVA. It is different. I love EVA. I also now love Nadesico. Of course, the loud whinning hasn't stopped, but it became bearable, especially after they nearly explained why everyone yells. That's one of my favorite things. They explain a lot about themselves and this series when the take about an anime within the show called Gekigengar. Everything. Trust me. This series is well worth the time/money/and effort."
5,Best Ping Pong Balls Ever,"Having experience with almost no brands of ping pong balls, I found that these were simply the best. Their durability, their flexibility, their sphericity, their presence, and their sheen were all beyond noteworthy - they were remarkable. I found these balls the best to engage in such sports as table tennis, also popularly known as ping pong, or table basketball, also popularly known as beer pong. Six beautiful ping pong balls for less than $2.00?! What more could I ask for?!"
2,blah,they really put no effort into this. it was a cute and sort of funny at times doc but had little to no substance - no critical thinking about the topic at all. sorta boring too
3,Interesting,"It's an interesting take on the changing male. It's worth watching. I wouldn't say it's comprehensive in anyway, but there are some interesting characters in the film."
1,The most ridiculous film ever!,Worthless piece of material that cannot be call documentary because it is not! The entire film is basically a man growing his beard and participating in a contest with other bearded man. Other portion of the film is about a Indian guy having waxing and plocking eyebrows because he want to be perfect. In the film he claimed to be straight but all his grooming and behavior are not manly! A truly piece of garbage! I can believe I waisted $4.00 renting this crab! I know better for the next time!
5,Chopper,"Tired of chopping small amounts of onions, garlic, parsley etc. Bought choppers before that did not work. Saw this one and gave it a try. Worked great. I can use it and put it in the dishwasher. After using it, bought a second on for my son that does a lot of cooking also. He also gives it good grades. It is not for chopping a whole onion but when you need a quarter cup or a few tablespoons it is excellent."
1,Expensive Junk,"I have had nothing but trouble with this chopper. The plastic insert that fits over the blades doesn't quite fit, and it can take up to five minutes to get the blades to line up so that you can put the outer plastic ring onto the silver top. Except that it doesn't quite fit either, and the thing simply won't latch without fussing, which means the blades slide out of the plastic insert while you are fumbling with the outer plastic ring. It would be great if I had three hands, but I don't, so I'm throwing this junk out and replacing it with a simple ring chopper and wooden bowl like my mother and grandmother used.A cheaper Cook's Special chopper was much, much easier to put together than this waste of money."
2,"Looks great, engineered poorly","I didn't realize that my girlfriend spent $40 on this thing. She thought she was buying a quality product. Worked fine for a while and, like the other reviewers, we began having problems reassemblying the unit after cleaning. Great idea, poorly executed. It is not sturdy enough for heavy duty kitchen usage, as I used it to chop veggies virtually every day. I am now searching for a professional model designed for restaurants."
5,Les Paul..... Does it get any better!,Great Book for a Great Price! I also would pick up the Moderne Era Les Paul book!
5,"Beautiful 1st book, now where's the 2nd?!?!?!","This is a wonderfully illustrated and detailed tome on the great Les Paul. If you're fascinated by the man and/or enjoy playing (or even just looking at) the various guitar models bearing his name, you'll love this book. I'm looking forward to the next one (the remainder of the set) which is scheduled for release by the end of the year."
5,A must have!,"This is definitely a must have for guitar lovers, especially Les Paul collectors. I bought this for my husband and he finished it in less than a week, couldn't put it down!"
4,Great Read,"Usually I am all for books that teach me techniques and help me apply strategies to my own life. This book didn't directly do that but did help me understand the power of persistence and self-belief.Through reading this book I learned how Winston Churchill never backed down and made keeping high public morale one of his highest priorities. I knew of Britain's importance to WWII but I did not know of his direct impact on keeping Britain a viable enemy for the German's.His written letters to Roosevelt and other authority figures were one of many hidden ways he added every ounce of help to the Ally's side of the war. I am sure without Churchill's character the war would of been much more difficult even with America's involvement and Hitler's mistake to attack Russia.Read this book slowly and notice all his character traits. You may get a lot out of it or, at the least, understand why Churchill is such an important person in history."
2,Don't waste your money!,"As an admirer of Churchill I was very excited by the discovery that there was a new book about him from his official biographer Martin Gilbert. However after ordering and reading the book I was very disappointed. There is absolutely no new information about Churchill in this 97-page ""pamphlet"". This ""pamphlet"" is simple the text of a lecture Martin Gilbert gave at the University of Toronto. If you have read ""Finest Hour"" or ""Churchill: A Life"" also by Martin Gilbert, there is no need to waste your money and read this abridgement."
4,A Storm of Swords,The Storm of Swords was very much in keeping with the first 2 books of the series. The twists are great. I won't even begin to predict what will happen next.
4,Excellent Story but Looooong,"I love reading this series. I love watching it on HBO even more. The story is excellent. Martin gives the story depth and there is no shortage of detail. It's easy to become invested in the main characters but almost impossible to keep track of the secondary characters. Martin does provide the genealogy of the various houses but it's confusing to read so I skip over it. What I like most about this series is that Martin isn't afraid to put the main characters in harm's way. I'm only about half way through with this book but I have been assured by friends that have read it that there will be surprises along the way. I think my favorite character is Daenerys. I want to see her succeed and win her way to the throne.Main point: Great story, easy to get into, but by no means a quick read."
5,good series,"I'm a quarter of the way through book three of Game of Thrones, it's as good as the first two. Love ether series..."
3,900 pages and it's not over!,"A good read, but horrible ending...The Fire and Ice series as a good fantasy epic. Interesting world building and characters that you love and some that you hate. Always interesting when most of the ""good guys"" die. All in all, these were bigs books with plenty of originality to keep a epic fantasy lover happy, but...The series just ends after the third book with no resolution! At lease with the wheel of time we get a new book every few years. I don't know if Martin plans on finishing this series, but if he doesn't, well get ready to be disappointed.[added 1/2003] Looks like Martin is about to join the ranks of goodkind and jordan and write a never ending series. I hope he does better than the other two and actually advanced the plot line in each book. Seems that Jordan and Goodkind are just milking their franchises."
2,not exactly as expected,"I bought this book, expecting a full-size hardcover book. It was priced cheaper, but I figured priced competitively. It turned out to be a small hard-cover book, the size of paperbacks. If I would have known, I would have purchased the full size hardcover for the additional price, or I would have bought the paperback for cheaper."
3,Not as Engaging,"While I was able to finish reading the third book, I did find myself skimming a great deal of it because quite frankly I find GRRM's writing pedestrian and tedious. I found myself laughing at a reviewer of the 4th book using the expression ""blah blah blah"" because I had exactly the same reaction. This book could and should have been edited heavily... as a fan of Neal Stephenson I'm no stranger to long-winded epics, but GRRM is just not *that* talented a wordsmith! Most of the plot twists were telegraphed well in advance, so there were no surprises and in the end you are left feeling like you have read a book, not entered a world. GRRM never lets you forget that the plot is not flowing naturally, but is in fact heavily contrived. Kurt Vonnegut said it best: ""...and so on."""
2,Pace slows to a crawl in book 3 - needs an editor!,"I was thoroughly enthralled with Books 1 and 2 for all the reasons that all the positive reviewers state clearly - imaginative, rich plot, whole variety of types of characters each with their own motives,etc etc. But in Book 3 I have reached an incredible level of frustration that key areas of the plot just do not seem to be moving forward. If this is book 3 and there are theoretically going to be 7 books in total, do I have to go through another several thousand pages to reach resolution? I am an avid reader and the volume of the books is not an issue, I just do not feel like I am rewarded for my efforts here. I finally gave up mid way through Book 3 and then just read the wiki summaries online for the rest.this is one of the few books which would actually benefit from an ""abridged"" version."
1,cheap trickery,"Maybe I'd have given this two stars if I hadn't seen so many reviews comparing it favourably to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. A Song of Ice and Fire started out well, but this last instalment seems to be going nowhere except downhill. Martin knows all the tricks, but I wonder what else he knows. This doesn't come anywhere near Tolkien - it's the conjurer's cheap tricks against the litterally wonderful magic of the wizard.I'm surprised so many people give it five stars, but I guess every book gets the readers it deserves."
3,Confused,"Dear George Martin,You confuse me Sir. Is this a trilogy or not? If not then I await the next installment in what has been an epic story, full of excitement and intrigue. Should you complete the series I would give my seal of approval and a hearty recommendation to anyone to read these well written and thoroughly entertaining books.However, If this is the final part (which I sincerely hope it is not) then I despair as you would have ended the saga in a confusing, botched, premnature, unfinished and shameful way. To end with ""A Storm of Swords"" would be cruel to your audience and would require you, if you have honour - as I am sure you do, to refund their hard earned money. In either case the message to your readers has not been clear. I suggest you mention this to your publisher as their PR job has obviously been somewhat poor.Sincerely yours,Andrew Bartlam"
2,dissapointing after 2 great books,"I would rate the previous volumes in this series very highly, and while this one has its moments ultimately it's a dissapointment. It feels as though Martin lost his way and couldn't work out what to do with his characters so ends up killing off a large number in the last hundred or so pages, or leaving them in limbo. I don't understand why the Danerys thread was in there if she never gets to actually challenge for the throne! The whole valar morgulis thread of arys' story (which I loved) never went anywhere either. And who was the black rider with cold hands who rescued Sam? Another intriguing sub-plot (well the whole book feels like subplots) that disappears. It feels like their should be a fourth volume to explain everything properly. Much of the first half of the book is gripping, but definitely loses its way in the second half. In the end just too many characters and plots which never came together."
5,Hard to put down.,I felt this was a wonderful read. I found this near impossible to put down. The shocking turn of events was staggering.
4,Honest to Goodness Plot,The scenes in the book are so vivid you have to take a deep breath and brace yourself for the things that will captivate your attention and suck you in. I thought I knew how George Martin writes a story that is where I am wrong. This book is different from the other two in terms of the plot however his passion for writing reflects in the book. I don't know about you but I recommend it to those who are willing to experience a different kind of fantasy where not all your expectations come true.
2,"Lannister's motto should be ""Heard it before..""","The first book was great the second was good and now the third book is wearing thin. When I first read the book I was a big fan. I enjoyed his characters depth and his gritty storing telling, alas I feel all of the books to date possess the same story. Several nobles who feel they should be the rightful king or queen. A noble family divided and are attempting to either escape or find there way home (this bit is especially dull.) and the mystery of the north. This storyline sofar to date has been in all three books and each book has over 1000 pages. My advice to Mr Martin - less description and recycled tales and more story."
1,He lost it.,Not worth the purchase. Plot wanders all over and loses some of the most interesting characters. Too many battles and too little progress in the story lines.
5,Best of the series...,"I've read everything Martin's written on ASOIAF and by far this is the best book. I believe it's the longest book in the series and the most pivotal one.Brace yourself for the red wedding, you won't be ready for it, no matter how many spoilers you've read or heard.Above all, enjoy the ride!"
2,Jumping off the Ice and Fire train...,"I'll keep this review short...Having read the previous two books, I think I gave this series enough chance to impress me. The best that can be said about this chapter is that it has some very jaw dropping twists and turns. Major characters get wiped off, and other characters launch into considerable growth both in personality, as well as in position on the chessboard. However, I found myself skipping over too many pages just to get to the good stuff. The book is filled with too much filler and fluff disguised as ""details"". Forgive me, but I like getting to the point. The books could use a little cutting and editing.I will keep ""in touch"" with the series through HBO from now on."
3,Robert Jordan deja vu,"I loved the first two books. Book three was obviously thrown together in order to get a product to market. Unfortunately, Martin is doing his best Robert Jordan impersonation. I'm not picking up another book until this season is finished - which I seriously doubt will ever happen.Look at the time that has passed between books - Robert Jordan all over again."
5,Best book in the series to date,"Expect to be immersed in more fierce battles, incredible adventures, and surprising character development. Unlike the first two, this book is a no-yawner from cover to cover, and is much better than the ""Feast for Crows"" and ""Dance with Dragons"" combined. It's too bad that the series didn't conclude with this third very long book, while the author was still inspired for it. With pages numbering in the double digits, this should have been possible, but for the publishers and their contracts."
1,The never-ending load of crap series!,Marin is a good writer as far as the first book went and then I get to the third book praying for a final and it doesn't even end. I get to the part where he slaughters all the good characters and I just threw the book away. What a waste of time and he doesn't even finish. I agree with other reviewers in go back to reading the series when he is on his 8th or 10th book when ever he bloody stops or all the characters are dead. If you want to read a a great author or great books then try David Gemmell.
1,"Over hyped, under written","It's almost too embarrassing to admit that I've read this ridiculous trash, it was at times juvenile fun but mostly just an overlong boring slog through an endless parade of heraldry and sigils. George RR Martin is just one of those fantasy authors who is better suited to writing for the want ads. If you disagree with this review you only prove my point."
3,Enough already!,"I surrender - I couldn't get through this volume. After devouring Books 1 & 2, I was eager to immerse myself in Book 3. But the death, misery, horror, cruelty, despair, and mercilessness is too much. I love you George, but there's no escapism here, not a scintilla. I know escapism is ""out"" these days, but have some pity on your readers!"
2,"Ok, that;s enough for me (spoiler warning!)","I've stuck with a Song of Ice and Fire for 3 books, waiting for Joffrey and the rest of the Lannisters to get what's coming to them, but this is where I draw the line. Of course, I'm referring to the way that Rob and Catelyn Stark met their ends. I found Catelyn to be completely unlikeable, but I'd gotten used to having her around. Granted, George R.R. Martin has managed to get me rooting for my 2nd least favorite character, Jamie, but I don't see any reason to continue this. Thanks for the ride, but I'm getting off before I really get sick."
2,Who's Left to Cheer For??? (Spoilers),"I haven't had any problems with the Kindle edition. I do have problems with killing off most of the more interesting and compelling characters and plot lines. Would X-Men be interesting if Wolverine was killed off immediately after Professor X was killed? Would Star Wars be watchable if Luke was killed by Darth Vader? Would Lord of the Rings be such a great story if Gandalf stayed dead and Sauron got the ring afterwards? I don't think I'll read the next book; I'm tired of inevitabilities being pushed and pushed along with new characters and twists being introduced all the while. For example, Ayra trying to get to her mom. Give me a break, how many people did she get passed along to throughout the 2nd and 3rd books?"
4,And the beat goes on...,"Martin is consistent. This third volume continues with the Game of Thrones. He adds new characters and new aspects to the story, but the primary characters stay in tact. It is engaging and certainly held my attention."
4,Great,"This is a continuation of the story from the previous 2 books, but has more the feel of the first book. I loved it."
5,"Grim tales, but engrossing","I've wanted to give this series 4.5 stars, so I'll go for five for Storm of Swords, the book with the most epic sweep, IMHO. If you can deal with the grimness and cruelty, this is a series worth sticking with for the scope of its imagined world, and range of characters. These characters continued to surprise me with the way their struggles manage to be both contrived and realistic. Perhaps most important, its an enjoyable read."
2,What happened?,"The story up to this point was magnificent, and now you've done in most of the captivating characters. I so enjoyed the first one that I had hoped the second would be even longer. Then I picked up this sequel, and after much slogging, finished this one out of passion for the series, chalking it up to writer's block or distraction with other stuff."
2,Stopped Reading,"I loved the first 2 1/2 books of the series. Character development is an important part of the book to me. I tore through the first 2 books and thought I had found another wheel of time type of series. Now it seems, anyone I was ""rooting"" for in the series is dead. I honestly stopped reading it. Have no intention of going back. This may be what other reviewers are calling not the usual fantasy. I personally like the standard fare it would seem. You know, where there are people in the story you have read about for a thousand or so pages actually live and overcome the obstacles put in their path.The world and politics were well played through the first 2+ books. That earned an additional star.One thing this does seem to have in common with the wheel of time is an excellent story could have been told in 3 books. This series (I understand) is supposed to be 7 in length."
2,Book 3 does not reach expectation,I had as many other readers great expectations regarding the development of the plot. Only I have come to realize that besides more murder and hopelessness there has been little advance in the story considering the large amount of pages!I fear the author started with a great idea that could have made a true piece of literature but that finally has become a product.
5,Addicted,"ElizabethI am thoroughly addicted to this series, and this book provided more ups and downs than a soup opera!"
5,Game of Thrones,"I had not watched the series on HBO yet and could not stop reading the books. Then I watched the series. Each book got me involved in characters, wanting to know what would they do next and who would win the next battle. Definitely well written, good visuals and descriptions."
2,story line,too many characters and the stories are too disjointed. You become totally disinterested in the characters because he drags the stories so much
4,a good alternative,I got hooked to the story watching the series on HBO. The book is not like watching it but it's a good alternative. Worth reading but --And I don't mean to spoil things-- there are parts where it can really break your heart.
3,Great book but increasingly involves adult themes.,"I enjoyed the first three books in this series. I agree with some that this series is better than the Wheel of Time series because the plot actually moves with each book. The story line is great and here's to hoping that the next installments are just as good.BUTThere are rather descriptive sexual scenes in these books. At first, it was just a scene or two but by this book there are several scenes and the descriptions continue to go into more detail about the various physical descriptions and actions of the characters. If there was any reason I would stop reading this series, it would be this. Actually, if the fourth book has similar descriptions, I'm done."
3,Disappointed,"This is an exciting story that plays very well on HBO, but in book form, falls short and is frustrating. The book is broken into quasi-chapters about each character done in chronological order. This is fine, but Mr. Martin likes to end each chapter with a cliff-hanger going on to another character's story. It is very disjointed, and frustrates me because I have to wait so long to return and resolve the original cliffhanger. The pacing and chronology is very frustrating. Just when I care about what is going to happen next, I'm taken to another place and time. In a shorter novel, this may work, but in a 1000+ page book this reader becomes quite frustrated.Rather than move on to the next book, I think I'll wait for the HBO adaption, which follows the novel quite closely."
1,Superior work,"My favorite aspect of Ice and Fire is the complexity of its characters. You are allowed to see the humanity of the most dastardly villan, while at the same time, even the most virtuous of characters have elements which, at best could be called weaknesses.While there is a solid core of the supernateral within the series, obvious in the opening, do not look for it within the first book, it is a captivating political story of a disintegrating kingdom with some of the best battle scenes in literature.I am EAGERLY awaiting the continuation. I will enjoy the first three again, before reading the forth. My only question is why the hard cover version of the first book was pulled by the publisher."
3,"Can you say ""Boris Karloff on a bad-hair day?""","The recording is fine. Clean and clear. As an undergrad, I used to love this recording: all the asymmetric meters, the unusual harmonies. I listened to it over and over.Now, however, the piece is strident to my ears. Images of a grainy, black-and-white horror film surface whenever the strings dominate the piece. The main theme, which Bartok *really* makes sure we recognize, seems incomplete and weak. Sorry. Again, I think the recording is fine. Nothing about the quality or the relative levels of the instruments bothered me, but my tastes (such as they are) have changed.Is that fair to put into a review?"
5,An historic performance!,"Thank goodness that this one is still available. Here, we have a brilliant rendering of some of Bartok's more popular works and Fritz Reiner at his very best. This is one of the great classical music performances of all time. A must for collectors."
3,"Wait a minute...Love your show, but...","Stop for a second... $80, that's a bit much. You can purchase a recently released 9 disc collection (by Travel Channel) elsewhere on Amazon for around $20-$25. It has EXACTLY the same episode content and some bonus stuff (behind the scenes, promotional trailers, and something called Tony and Friends, Alice Cooper, Ted Nugent and more... For 25% of the price listed here, in a single package. I guess there might be some more bonus on these ""individual"" collections, but are they worth the $60 price difference? I guess if you're a purist... Just thought youd like to know. Love these episodes, but times are tough all over.Look around for the 9 disc set, save your cash to pay your cable bill... I'm holding my recently arrived copy in my hands as I post this."
2,1 and a half stars,"Had potential, but couldn't focus on the story. It was definitely too choppy, as another reviewer said, so it was difficult to get into the story. It was hard to catch up.Someone else said it should have been written this way: the past in a prologue, and the present as the book. That is very true. If it had been written that way, it certainly would have been easier for the rest of us to view the book as good as the high-raters."
5,Donnie's BEST!,"I just thought that this movie was the BEST Donnie Yen movie ever! There were amazing fight scenes between Donnie Yen and Rongguang Yu. I especially liked the rooftop fighting scene. The plot was pretty decent too and actually made some sense- in other words it wasn't too choppy at all. However,I thought the quality of the picture could have been better and the subtitles were a little inaccurate. Overall, I really recommend this movie to everyone."
3,great fightning scenes,"the mocvie in the plot was pretty lame, stealing for the rich and giving to the poor, but the fight scenes was preety good. even thought it was pretty fake, you will enjoy every moment of the scenes. so if you feel like reading the enlish at the bottom of the screen then go see it. but its cool"
4,Great. Yuen Woo-Ping in top form,"The Iron Monkey is one part Robin Hood, one part Batman, and all kick butt Chinese folk hero.Iron Monkey boasts all the elaborate fight sequences one comes to expect from Woo-Ping, and he does not disappoint. His use of wirework and tricky, outlandish choreography rarely looks clumsy and is smooth and impressive here, particularly when Iron Monkey is fighting. The movie moves well, never drags, and a few of the humorous gags provide a good chuckle or two without, as Woo-Ping can sometimes do, stretching the humor for too long. Highly Recommended.Only able to find the dubbed version to watch (subtitles are always preferred), I found the dubbing to be tolerable and better than most. Tai Seng also has abetter copy than I expected from them. For video, its one of the better HK tranfers I've seen."
1,Corny? Cheesy? Or both?!?,"I have seen several martial arts movies through the years and Iron Monkey has to be one of the cheesiest movies I have ever seen. The fight scenes are noticeably speed up, the dubbing is absolutely terrible and incredibly corny and the ""special powers"" (or whatever you call the cheesy flying and humanly impossible punching and kicking ability) is so overused that it becomes laughably absurd. This movie is definitely not up to the standards of Yuen Woo-ping's other movies he has choreographed and wastes the talents of the very talented stars of the movie."
3,"Fun Kung Fu movie, but nothing special","This movie is entertaining and the Kung Fu is good. However, the storyline and acting is extremely cliche. This movie has *nothing* on Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Expect a cheesy B movie with some good Kung Fu fighting scenes, because that is what you are going to get."
5,Wide Field of view,"I bought this because I had a hard time finding objects in the sky with my scope and I figured the larger field of view would help.I found that it did. I use an older orion 6"". It was surprised with how nice the wide view of the sky looked.I do have a 16 mm and find it easy to center objects with this one and switch.Overall I am very happy with the quality.I have not used very many eyepieces; but this became my favorite very quickly."
4,One of Kander and Ebb's Best Scores,"Kander and Ebb's score for KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN is a delightful mix of rumba, salsa, and Broadway standards. I recieved this recording after owning the Vanessa Williams version for several years, and both are excellent, though I think Williams was ten times better than Rivera, who is really not right for the role. Her voice is has a nice style to it, but she sounds like an old lady (which she is, as cruel as that is to say), instead of a young temptress. Brent Carver, on the other hand, has a voice that is beautiful as it is effortless. Anthony Crivello is also in good form as Valentine, though I happen to be very fond of Brian Stokes Mitchell's voice. Also,this CD does not include some of the key dialogue included in the later Williams version, which made smoother transitions between songs. I recommend KISS, but think that the Vanessa Williams version is a little stronger if I had to choose between the two."
4,Canadian/European Version,"This came out about a month before FG's Guide to Grace Under Pressure in Canada and Europe. It's the same book, just packaged for those markets. A good read, even if the release was a bit confusing."
3,Bought it only if you have money to waste,"I would not reccomnd this album though it has some good songs because there are lots of better albums out there needed to be explore, so dont waste you hard money on this."
4,Simplifying Timeshare reviewed,"I am biased because I know Karen Holden and was part of the editing process.This is not a sales book, but a ""how to"" book.It is written to help the person who bought timeshare already learn how to use what they bought, since the chances are they were lied to in the sales presentation, or were under such pressure they did not remember ACCURATELY what they were told.Yes, Karen believes in timeshare, so maybe that is why another reviewer thought it was a sales book.If a person owns timeshare and wants the unbiased facts of how to use it better, the book will help.If a person is thinking of buying timeshare, the book will expose some of the scams used to sell it, and help the person ask the proper questions to see if the product will help them achieve better vacations than they would have otherwise.I am proud to have been part of the process."
5,Helpful to troops headed to Afghanistan,"My husband is currently serving in Afghanistan. Of course, he is an Arabic linguist so he spoke no Pashto. So, this has helped enormously. He can understand much of what is said now without relying on the interpreter. Of course, the most helpful thing would have been to send him where he understood the language. That, however would have been against Army policy, too logical."
5,A must have for the Chicago Rock enthusiast!,"I've been searching for this cd everywhere! It is a definate must have for anyone who enjoys Chicago Rock and Roll. Ralph Covert and the guys are having such a great time on stage, you can't stop it from rubbing off on you!"
5,Casio Men's FT610WV-3BV,This is my second Watch like this and the other one lasted me 3 years. I am always scratching crystal on the face of my watch however this one stayed scratch free. And until the battery went out it never lost time. A good deal at twice the price
4,excellant purchase. great value for the price.,"In this economy, great value is hard to find, except for this watch. excellant workmanship. the only problem is reading digital numbers and setting the digital settings. for the price I am pleased."
3,"For women, not men","This is a book for women. Is it a good book to help a woman better understand her man? Possibly - I couldn't say.This is not a book for men. There's just one chapter for men, and if you're the kind of guy who would pick up a self-help book in the first place, you probably already know most of what's in there, or can find some other book more tailored to a man's needs. Personally, I'm a fan ofNo More Mr. Nice Guy!"
5,A must read for anyone who wants to be in a relationship,"I have been reading this book nonstop. I was curious if it has helped others as much as it has helped me! It looks like it has.This is a fantastic book, it not only has been helping my relationship with my husband without him knowing why, but I see so many of my friends relationship problems explained in front of my eyes! Not only the explanations but how to fix things.Thank you for this book."
3,its ok. not bad for price,not what i expected but still a good book. thought it would have more say on things each of us should do but it wasnt a book i could read and just nod and chuckle at how real it was
2,not what i expected,"if you've read Men Are from Mars, etc., you don't need this book. Just like Men Are from Mars, it discusses the emotional/social differences between the sexes. Since I already read Men Are from Mars, I already knew that and in what ways. Don't waste your money..."
1,traditional gender norms and biases pervade this book,"If you like reading books that make repeated assertions based on ""studies,"" but fail to footnote said studies so that you can read them yourself, this is the book for you.However, if you think that authors who reference others' work should actually include information about those works so that you can evaluate the validity and generalizability for yourself, look elsewhere.This book is sloppily written, insulting to both genders, and barely a step up from the extremely-traditional sexual/gender roles evidenced in ""Men are from Mars..."" If you're a woman who is a problem-solver rather than a talker, or a man who doesn't think that talking about emotions is ""gross women's stuff,"" you will get little from this book (except irritation).If you're in even a mildly non-traditional relationship, avoid this book at all costs.Comment"
4,Continue on with China,"I really like this series, and this, the third book in the series is just as good as the others. In this book China takes on a challenging case to try to absolve her friend of a murder that was staged to look like she had done it. China relies on her lawyer friend and her very eccentric friend Ruby to help her friend, the town eccentric called the ""cat lady"". We also see China take the big step of a committment with her boyfriend. There's enough murder and mayhem as well as gardening information to satisfy anyone who is of that bent."
4,I enjoyed this book,"I am a big fan of the Cloud/Townsend books and pretty much buy one sight unseen, as I did this one. While for me it is not quite at the level of How People Grow it was still very helpful.For these authors, relationships with other people are key to growth. In How People Grow the author describes feeling like it was God's ""plan B"" to have people help him--that God really should do it directly and he was getting 2nd best. He later came to realize that people are God's ""plan A"". So I don't think it is a case of ""tell lots of people about your problem"", but rather an acknowledgement that the Body of Christ is called that for a reason: that God uses His people as vehicles for His love.Anyway, that is just one part of this book. In general I found it very useful to have all the principles of growth broken down in this way and then have applications to specific life situations in the 2nd half of the book. These authors are very practical, which I like."
1,Disappoining,"I came to this book eagarly anticipating real help from a Christian perspective or at least a bit of comforting, but was sorely disappointed. The analysis and approach are shallow. Manifested symptoms of suffering are addressed but never the root cause. Perhaps this book can help someone with a surficial problem, but anyone looking to address the root of their human suffering will leave with no further guidance. I'm surprised the authors are successful in their counselling, perhaps there are plenty of people out there with run of the mill ""easy"" issues who don't need something deeper. If that's you, OK try the book, otherwise forget it."
5,Love It,Perfect - I found the 2 c one not bright enough and the 3 d cell too bulky - perfect balance
5,Witty and entertaining!,"I first watched ""Shawn of the Dead"" on a first date with my current boyfriend in his living room. Watching a movie on the first date can get kind of awkward, but I believe this particular movie took all awkwardness away. It's definitely a movie to take lightly, it strives on the ridiculousness of serious zombie movies and twists it into a quirky, funny, and enjoyable comedy.There was a shipping error, they sent me the blueray version of the movie instead of the normal. Still there was nothing to freak out about, everything was taken care of immediately.In short, if you like British humor and wit, I definitely recommend this movie!"
4,Tres Mujeres,This is a good novela that starts out kind of slow but gets more interesting as the plots develops turning pretty good at the end. The novela was very well put together and easy to follow. I just wish it was a little bit longer or like someone else said in a review I'll be more than happy to pay more for the full version of this novelas.
3,installation instructions would be nice,"I bought my wife a trike and she wanted a larger seat for it. I purchased this one because it specifically said ""adult trike seat."" I installed the seat and she likes the size of it, however, there were no instructions and the U bracket that came with it (no other hardware was enclosed) cannot be installed on the trike so there is no support for the back of the seat. Installation instructions would be nice to have."
2,flimsy chinese cables,"Garmin so called network cables are the cheapest junk I have ever seen. Just ordered a third cable, as the first two didn't work once installed. I really wish they put together a quality American made marine cable instead of this 3.00 worth of junk.If you are planning on doing an installation you need to have extra cables, as I had a total of 4 bad cables, no matter how delicately they get handled."
2,not impressed,"it's a shampoo... nothing special. The only thing we've found to make our dogs less itchy is conditioner spray. The shampoo smells good but was too thick for the pump to work property so we have to squeeze it out, hence we never use it anymore."
2,Its just Shampoo,"I personally don't recommend this shampoo. Like the other person has stated its just shampoo that smells good, nothing special about it. In fact it may have made my dog more itchy then he was to start off with. I'm disappointed with this product."
2,Bland and blah,"Great concept, bad execution. I'm all for cutting down on sugar intake and I love to bake, so finding lower calorie options or just healthier options is always great.I only made 1 of the recipes...the Cinnamon Orange Bread. Before putting the batter into the pan I tasted it. Yuck. Not remotely sweet-and I used regular rather than unsweetened OJ. Not even flavorful for that matter. Flavor doesn't have to mean sweet but the title of the book is Sweet and Sugarfree. I ended up chopping dried cranberries and apricots and adding to the batter before baking. Nothing. No help whatsoever. It's in the garbage.Fortunately I only bought this book for $3.00 at a second hand store, because if I'd spent more than that I'd feel pretty ripped off."
3,b-monster flick that has its good points,"As a connoisseur of 50's scifi monsters - if not invading aliens, they almost invariably involve radiation, mutation, and murder - this is a pretty good one. Rubber suit and all, Sun Demon has good characters, from the affected scientist-turned-beast to his girls. He struggles to do the right thing, but, well, fails. Then it gets gruesome, before becoming a chase. As a kid, I remember wanting to see this, but couldn't because ""it was playing in a bad neighborhood"", so now I have finally realized my desire (in a fit of insomnia over the internet). OK, it's a formula, but at least it is well done.Recommended for the cognoscenti."
1,Don't Get Robbed Like I did...,"If you were a fan of the first Volume because of the creativity and how these directors were pushing the envelope, I would suggest not spending your hard earned money here on volume 2. All of these videos lack imagination, I hope that Volume 3 will have more interesting directors, frankly, I was bored, You could turn on MTV and see better videos than this garbage. I am raing this Item ""1 star and that is due to the good packaging design, and not the content."
2,cut too full,"This slip is made of a nice fabric but cut way too big in the bust area...will keep it since shipping cost to return is so high, but will have to give it away or send to consignment shop."
1,disappointed,got this as a gift for someone living abroad. watch stopped working after one week. returning it was not feasible so it was sent to repair. problem could not be repaired and since it was a gift this was just an embarassment to me!!!
1,Bad,"There are so many typos! I at first did not correct the typos, then started to correct them then got so frustrated because there were so many I gave up. I also did not like how the author kept going on and on about a certain subject or what a person was saying. It did not keep my interest, in fact put me to sleep. I could not get into the characters. I think it was a very poor written book. The typos and grammar need to be corrected. This is a book, there should not be so many typos. I can understand a few but there are so many it's uncalled for!"
3,Fair to Middling,"The Q is a very sensitive instrument, so if I carry it in anything other than the hard carrier which came with it, it can do all sorts of thigs on its own by being bumped and tapped unintentionally, even call phone numbers I had no knowledge of and make unwanted sounds while I walk. Thus I learned very quickly not to use the nice leather case I bought to go with it.On the other hand, the vehicle recharger is a godsend. I use it all the time, and it does very well for me. I recommend it highly."
2,Just not enough...VERY VERY Basic!,"I bought this book, hoping it would go farther than getting into the ""front door"" of DMing. I kept reading, telling myself, no it is going to go into depth, it is going to hit on some substance, but it never did.It spends too much of its time, focusing on the ""dummy"" concept. It repeats itself over and over again, stating ""you are the DM, you are the one that runs the game"". Yes I know that, now get on with the book, I kept saying!If you are a totally new DM, then this book will be helpful. If you have run a game, a couple of times, then you have probably already figured out all of the concepts mentioned here."
3,A big help for a working DM,"Although this book is written with the D20 system in mind, it applies to second edition as well. I enjoy all the ""dummies"" books and this one is no exception. It gives you plenty of tools to keep in your DM arsenal.Our games are now much more organized, flow better, and has made DMing a much more enjoyable part of the hobby as opposed to a chore you get stuck with.A great tool for experienced AND new DMs alike. This book would have gained an extra star if a little less time was spent on the social skills to finding games and players. I feel this is space that could have been used more on fantasy cartography, and more inspirations.Even still, this was a book that improved our gaming greatly."
2,Why this difference?,"I bought this version under Mauceri and I was NOT pleased with the quality of sound or the listlessness of the playing. Mind you, this is a DECCA recording, released 2002. There has been no Amazon page review of this Decca recording before I write this but I made my purchase based on reviews on classical music webpages of the glorious music.Now I discover that there is an identical 3-CD set under Mauceri on Polygram (IMPORT) label ASIN: B000004215 on these Amazon pages which, as I write, has 11 enthusiastic reviews.The price of the Polygram disk is three times as much as this ca. $24 issue. WHY I wonder?"
5,Great Product,My husband loves this brand of tools. Great quality that lasts a long time. He bought these with the tool set and he loves them all!
5,Renaissance scholars and performers rejoice!,"Decades after its initial publication and after having been out of print for too many years, it's great to see Howard Mayer Brown's bibliography on instrumental back in circulation. This highly- respected resource is of continuing use to any scholar interested in instrumental music of the renaissance. The sheer number of entries and the detail of their citations makes this source an easy to use and never-ending aid to those who need to check a detail quickly, those who want to compile more specific bibliographies of renaissance music, or even those early music performers seeking new repertoire. Aside from Daniel Heartz' bibliography of music published by Pierre Attaingnant which includes both vocal and instrumental music, few secondary sources provide as much information for renaissance scholars and performers alike. With its re-release, users no longer have to stay in the library to consult this valuable source."
2,"Good transfer, but where's the stereo soundtrack?","This little-known Western epic from 1968 is flawed as biography, but is an action film first and foremost. Originally presented in 70mm Super Cinerama as a roadshow, this transfer begs the question - what happened to the 6-track stereophonic soundtrack? And, where are the overture and intermission? The picture is from 65mm negative/70mm print and is fairly sharp and clear, as befits the enlarged negative, but without the stereo sound, it becomes a hollow-sounding Western wannabe spectacular. Snaps to MGM/UA for actually releasing the full 141 minute version at all, but why not include all the accoutrements of the original presentation? The film was created for huge screens, and needs the support of the full-bodied original soundtracks to do the visuals justice. And those of us who love film always want the overture and intermission if the film was first presented that way!"
3,"Big on Action, Not So Much on Accuracy!","This movie has lots of action and is spot on in regards to Custer's ego. However, the ""Custer's Last Stand"" is full of inaccuracies. All in all, it's a fun movie to watch. I especially enjoyed the scene when Custer assumed command and ""whipped"" the outfit into shape. Only he and the old Sargeant finished the drill. Great!"
3,MGM DVD Not Up To Par,"I bought this movie because I indulge myself in Custeriana. As history it is highly flawed as I suspected it would be. As in most Custer movies this one manages to capture some facets of a highly complicated life and personality. For contrast, I think that"
5,Charming but thought-provoking,"The review below is wonderful enough to give you a good idea for the plot of this charming novel. What happens to Jane makes you consider the way you live life - do you just keep things in order and calm, or do you toss in a radical upheaval here and there? Barnes has written with beautiful description and the story flows quickly. Definitely worthy of its Pulitzer..."
4,Lloyd Webber instrumentally straight up...,"The LSO under the direction of British conductor Anthony Inglis gives us a symphonic tour de force of Andrew Lloyd Webbers most popular theatrical scores. Inglis takes the more serious less gimmicky approach, conducting arrangements more in the vain of 20th Century Romanticism.(akin to Richard Strauss) There is little exaggerated if any electronic instruments involved adding to the pure instrumental experience. Phantom and JC Superstar are the headliners, everything else I would consider just filler, though a short suite from ""Cats"" is nicely fleshed out considering it's a one hit(Memory)wonder. All and all this effort is a pleasant listen lead by a conductor who is just as at home directing Mozart as he is in the theatre orchestra pit."
4,Lose yourself in order to find yourself,"This is an exceptional study of the Patagonian gauchos and their life style and habitat before it is extinguished forever by western values, money and culture. As a tourist in Patagonia it should be required reading, especially if you are attempting a riding trip there as we were, across the Andes. For a moment you can understand what you are seeing and experiencing, for a second you are part of the scenary, not just watching it voyeuristically unfold before you. I don't think I understood travel until I read this book.I will never travel again with my eyes open and my mind closed."
3,make u have sonething to read in W.C.,"this book only help us through the single player mission.if u can't think a way to beat those mission, u buy this.but doesn't help much in the multiplayer games...............i would say try to make yourself lose, i say again, makeyourself lose 20 to 30 games in the multiplayer games , u can write a better one."
5,Great watch!,"The watch is amazing my boyfriend loves it! the wrapping (I paided extra for wrapping) job sucked though, but amazing watch"
