2,Brutal...,"I absolutely despised reading this book. It was the textbook used for a Java course that I was taking. I found that I used other Java reference books more often than I used this one. Not good for Java beginners, gives a small overview for intermediates."
4,ABC of Architecture,"This is a book required by a Boston College professor. As such I didn't expect much other than a text book. I was wrong. This is a fine book on the basics of architecture and I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest, academic or otherwise, in the subject.Thanks"
2,"Sounds Cool, but Looks like a woman's purse...","I was quite excited about the prospect of having a Palm Cover that matched exactly my Wetsuit.(Sad, really) Unfortunately when I got it, my friends informed me that it looked like I was carrying my girlfriends purse...Also, it does seem to turn itself on a lot inside the cover.Still, its functional."
5,"Looks great, works great, highly recommended","It provides good cushioning (although I haven't dropped mine <G>), and it looks great. It fits ""like a glove,"" and the zipper is very smooth. It comes with a little card for the window slot. I wasn't going to use the velcro, but I like the case so much, I decided I'll probably use the case for as long as I use my Palm, so I put on the velcro patch. It holds it very securely; I can even open it and turn it upside down and the Palm stays attached. I highly recommend this."
1,Not for Palm VII Users!,"This case does NOT fit the Pam VII at all. It is such a tight squeeze and because it was so tight, it kept hitting the buttons on my Palm VII and running down the batteries."
5,Clase 406,"I really like this cd. It is so good.You Should buy it. My faves are DE DONDE VIENES A DONDE VAS,DOS ENAMORADOS,SHA LA LA LA,SOLO UN POQUITO,JAMAS,POR TI."
4,Beautiful T- shirts,"These are of better quality than I had expected. The printing on them is top quality. The only complaint is that they are alittle stiff, but still beautiful!"
2,"Not a heater, maybe a warmer","If all you want is something with some retro styling that will warm your toes under a desk, this may be what you need. But if you want something that actually heats a small space, skip this one. This doesn't even function well as a fan, because it only has 2 speeds; low speed and super low speed.Okay, so now that we moved it to the bathroom, it does a noticable job, but still only 2 stars on the overall rating."
3,An okay read,"I really enjoyed the first two books of this trilogy, but this one left me a little underwhelmed. Amberdrake, Skan and the others are all older, so the focus changes to their children, who, badly wounded, get lost on a mission and their fathers lead a rescue party.Things I liked: the pacing for the first two thirds of the book; I did enjoy the characterizations of Amberdrake, Skan et al, how being parents of the missing changed their viewpoints.Things I didn't like? Normally, Lackey writes teen emotions really well. In fact, some of her strongest work deals with outsiders trying to fit in and the rejection they receive. Here, this is all glossed over. It's mentioned, then put away. The last part of the book felt very, very rushed.Overall, this book is for people who live the Valdemar books or who have read the other books in this trilogy. Otherwise, no so much."
3,Weak sequel,"Welllll, I'm sorry to say this particular book doesn't live up to the previous two. Though I think it's worth the experience to read, it won't help the reader gain any particularly good insight on well, anything, like the other two Mage Wars books did. It's a lot more shallow, action-oriented, appealing to people who like wilderness survival and fighting books."
3,Unfortunately weak,"I am a big fan of Mercedes Lackey, especially the Valdemar series books. I truely enjoyed Black Gryphon and White Gryphon. Unfortunately, the third book in the series, Silver Gryphon, is definately the weakest of that series. It is intended as a kind of ""Passing on to the next generation"" story, but it doesn't pull it off well. The impression that I got was that Misty and Larry tried to take a short story concept and build it up into a novel. Die hard fans will like that there is some continuation of the base characters from the first two novels, but as a whole, I would have much prefered the third in the trilogy to bring more closure to the story."
3,"Serrat es fabuloso, lástima de los arreglos musicales","Serrat es el mejor, pero en este CD se ha perdido toda la majia que transmiten sus canciones en la versiones originales. Los arreglos musicales son malísimos. Joan Manuel sigue cantando magnífico. Yo esperaba un gran CD, desgraciadamente quedé muy desepcionado con este trabajo."
1,poor quality,I had a remington shaver for 26 years before it finally died on me. I bought this remington wet/dry and it failed on me the first week. The screens at the top of the shaver tore apart cutting into me deeply. So very disapointed in the quality of this product.
1,Unfortunately Not a Good Product,"After having tried to use this shaver for 4+ months, I am going back to razor-shaving my legs. This product is ridiculous; I shave over my legs multiple times, only to still see almost or all of the hair still there. I have tried making my skin taut, letting the skin sit as is for the shaver, pushing the shaver into my skin, letting the shaver work lightly over my skin, etc. etc. Nothing has made an appreciable difference.I am very disappointed in this product. When you actually get it to shave the hair, yes it shaves incredibly close, almost as close as a razor. However, the amount of time I have to spend going over and over on my skin to get the shaver to pick up the hair is just ridiculous. I am so frustrated; I wish there was a good electric shaver out there that shaved close and shaved the first time or two that you put it over your skin."
1,Very disapointed,"I have had a Remington 3600 shaver for close to 4 years, until I dropped it twice in a couple of days and it busted beyond repair =( So when I went looking for a replacement, I of course wanted another Remington seeing as how much I loved my last one(which is no longer made), boy was that a disaster. This shaver barely shaves at all, it takes me 30-45 minutes to get a really good shave and then I have to touch up every morning before work. I have used this razor for 3 weeks now and I wish I had kept the box because it would go back. So instead it will probably go in the trash when I buy my new one."
1,Would not recommend buying a Remington WDF4820,This is a product that does not do the job in completely removing leg hair even after going over the same area multiple times. Not returnable after 30 days of purchase. Would not buy another Remington Women's Shaver.
1,Ouch!,This razor takes forever... You have to go over the hair so many times your skin gets irritated and it is painful. I would not recommend this shaver.
5,Nice collection of craft ideas,"I bought this book to use with my grandchildren, aged 4 and 8. I like the spiral binding, and most of the ideas are good for children this age, as advertised--give or take a year or so either way, depending on the child. The best part is the recyle/reuse aspect of this collection. The materials are readily available and the concept sparks related ideas for creative ""green"" children's projects."
3,I expected more from Kino Video,"I was really looking forward to the DVD version of this film. Too bad Kino didn't take the time to clean the picture and fix the audio. I guess I shouldn't complain. Ballet is so rare on DVD, I will grab any I can find. But a film with Cyd Charisse, Moira Shearer, Zizi Jeanmarie and Roland Petit deserves a better presentation."
5,Best!!,"This product is amazing and wonderful! They give real cleavage, lift and fullness WITHOUT SURGERY!!! I am in a business where appearances are close to everything and I have AA cups. After much pressure to get surgery and feeling insecure about myself I got these and WOW! They look so natural that I even believe them! They fit into bras and bikinis too!! Slip them into bikini tops that have a slit for padding and they look real, for real. I love them, I love them! And my new motto is ""I have silicone breasts too, I just keep the silicone on the outside of my body."" :)"
2,A great disappointment!,"Designer Style Handbags: Techniques and Projects for Unique, Fun, and Elegant Designs from Classic to RetroWhat a disappointment! I was hoping for a book that catered more to the experienced seamstress and more upscale designs. Found that this book contained projects for the younger set, although the instructions were easy and well illustrated this is definitely not a book for the accomplished sewer or anyone looking for a higher level of design."
3,Not impressed,"I purchased this book to get ideas for ""designer style"" handbags. The book contains some good ideas, but not what I consider ""designer"" by any means. I found the designs to be more for little girls or old ladies. It is well written and the instructions are well thought out and detailed enough. It's just not what I had expected at all."
5,A Special Book....,"I love this book! I remembered it from my childhood, and bought it to share with a younger family member, so they could enjoy it too. Who can resist the image of the beautiful, fluffy, baby duck? Gorgeous and beautiful photos throughout the book and a cute story! Shows all the growing stages of the duck! Would reccomend this book for any child!"
3,Worth a read,"I enjoyed Kashmira's book very much. It was well written, and was a poignant story that grabbed the reader's attention. It was however heavy on the similes and at times, became slow, going off into tangents that bored me. Overall, a good showing for a first novel.I enjoyed her second novel much more."
3,It's a great story but the author has problems with her character's voice,"I wish this character had sounded more like a real twelve-year-old girl. All the kid characters in the story had this problem -- they all sounded much older than their ages, and they all sounded the same. I mean, what twelve-year-old says things like, ""Inside our hearts we were feeling the warmth and light of a new friendship""? I think the story would have done better written in the third person.That said, nine-to-twelves will enjoy this story of a girl transitioning between two cultures. In addition to the typical immigrant problems like learning English, there are also problems in the story like a mean girl at school, and fighting with a cousin, that non-immigrant kids can understand and identify with. I also liked the way colors were used in the story. I get the impression that India is a very colorful place."
3,Fun,"Girls love it if they have an imagination. The top spins with laughter or clapping, but it is a weak motor and can get stuck easily. It is designed to hold figurines by a small strap on their backs to make them appear as they are flying. Figurines sold separately may not come with a hook/strap to put on the tree."
3,eh,"I had great expectations for this olive oil, which colors my rating. I found the flavor a little off - maybe it had been sitting in a warehouse too long? - and so I don't use it much."
2,Don't lose one of the phones,If you damage or lose one of the phones you are out of luck. Called manufacture (Thompson) and they are unable to supply replacements.
2,short battery life and bad reception,"I have to agree with everyone else on the reception...i constantly have clicking sounds and 'white noise.' If an appliance is on (such as the microwave), the noise is unbearable. Also, I usually have to pick up the other handset after 30-40mins of a conversation because the low battery signal will start beeping in. Very, very annoying. My husband and I have had this phone for 2 years and if we didn't have cell phones we probably would have thrown this phone out the window a long time ago. This is the worst phone I have every owned."
1,One of the worst phones I've seen in a while,"Bought this set to replace 2 Panasonic cordless phones I had that for some reason have no battery life, even with new batteries...but that's a whole other story.The features sounded great...ability to transfer calls from one handset to another, walkie-talkie type feature that would function even when the power is out, hold button. But I never got to try them out. These phones had the worst reception. For example...if I was in my kitchen with the exhaust fan above the stove on, I couldn't hear the person I was talking to. Even if I was in the living room sitting next to the base, the reception was horrid...static, volume changes. Even the loudest volume setting was no help.The one thing I did like about it...the color combination. The green and grey was very pretty.Needless to say, I returned it to Target yesterday."
5,Excellent caller ID,"This caller ID was easy to get up and running. It is easy to see and read. After using several other instruments, I like this one best."
4,GE Caller ID,"I've only had this caller ID for a month and a very satisfied with it. Price is right. Received in a short time and arrived in good condition. Love the large number display, Timer, and Call back features. I've had no problem reading the display. I bought this to use with an old speakerphone. The feature I disliked is that the line cord that connects to the telephone jack is permanently attached and not very long. I have 3 other caller ID's and none of them have permanent attached cords. I had to move my phone to a different place so the cord would reach to the telephone jack. For this reason I rated it 4 stars."
2,caller id box,This product does not provide the telephone number of an incoming call if you are currently on the telephone. This was a feature that was stated in the product discription and my my reason for purchasing it. I was very disappointed that this product did not perform as described.
2,Product could be much better. GE 29096GE1-B,"I purchased 2 of these caller ID's (GE 29096GE1-B) through Amazon, using on Vonage phone service. Order Date: September 15, 2008 4 month review.LIKES* Large Display* Low cost* Holds 70 numbers* Redial feature* EZ installedBIG Dis-likes* Battery cover is VERY Very hard to remove.* Batteries need to be replaced once month.* Doses not have AC Adapter capability.* Displays contrast is dimly lit.* The caller ID size is larger then described.* When second line beeps in, it causes the ID to temp hang up the line you are on. And this is noticeable by both parties'. (You and caller 1). I have a VERY big issue with this problem. I have change the phone I use, swapped caller ID with my wife's.Over all disappointed with this Item. How come manufacture cant get a clue about user interface and real customer needs?"
4,"works great, little pricey for 14.99","i found the same thing at walmart after 2 months for 9.99 and I wanted to smack my head. Couldn't return it to amazon because it passed the time limit. However, works great. Easy to set up. I have no problems yet but I will repost if there is."
2,Not so pleased with this item.,I did not realize this caller ID did not have a lighted display. That is a disappointment. It does not pick up on all calls either. Would not purchase again nor do I recommend for purchase to anyone.
2,Mediocre Caller ID,"I have had a number of issues with this Caller ID product.To begin with, however, I was at fault for not reading the product description closely enough. I didn't notice that thus was a battert only powered product.The display, regardless of the angle, seems to dim for my tastes. I don't know if this is a consequence of being battery powered.The battery compartment itself is unusually difficult to pry open and it seems that the battery needs to be replaced far to frequently, with what I would think is a low voltage appliance.I would not purchase this specific model again."
4,History is only agreed upon facts.,"I was completly uninitiated with the works or life of Mr. Vidal. But I must say that since I've been reading the book and afterwards I've been fascinated with both him and his times. This can not be a bad thing since we as Americans are quit ignorant when it comes to history of even the last 40 years. I found the book slow in places, yes; bitchy at times, a little; but I always went to work the next day feeling entertained and enlightened not only with the incredible intellect of Gore, but the glittering times, the fantastic people, and the odd political thinking of the author. Oh, and lest I forget; I dearly loved the underplayed yet prevailant descriptions of the sexual activity of the times and the exploits of some. What a treat. I'm not politically the same as Gore, but I do agree with him in art, sex, and a personal work ethic. You Freudians can go take a hike. At least Gore is honest and fun!"
4,"Thanks for the memories, Gore","If you're a literary snob like myself, you'll love it. I mostly enjoyed your off the cuff anecdotes regarding literary preferences and celebrities. Gossipy? Hell no! The story of Jimmie, the real story, however brought a few tears. I left feeling grounded again."
3,"Great Individual Pieces, but a Rather Disjointed Read","Gore Vidal was, quite simply, brilliant; a writer blessed with a unique capacity for self-expression as well as an ability to transmute and record experiences around him. Not only a writer, but a politician, critic, author, aesthete; he was a true polymath. PALIMPSEST records isolated moments in his life, as well as meetings with remarkable people: Vidal, quite simply, knew everyone that there was to know. Anyone looking for an insight into his character, however, will feel somewhat disappointed by the book. It is a great read as a series of essays, but lacks the kind of self-analysis that one might have expected from such a prestigious writer. Perhaps Vidal was just too much of a public figure: the public persona eventually overwhelming the private figure. However the book has one redeeming grace - a moving account of the death of Vidal's long-term partner in his mid-seventies."
2,Is A Cross Between Jackie Collins and George Plimpton Lit?,"Pity Poor Gore Vidal. The man clearly possesses an agile mind with a compassionate political sense. Unfortunately, these have been filtered through the murky cracked lens of a monster's upbringing. His bitter disregard of feelings or opinions not his own palls very quickly."
4,Sharo knives again!,Haven encountered a month or so with dulol knives its good to be able to hon a good blade\using this great product.
1,Ordered a Steel...received a can opener,DONT BUY THIS.I got a can opener when I ordered a steal & customer service makes it impossible to do anything about it.
4,How refreshing!,"Billy Joel has given us a cd that is easy to listen to and has a great ability to lift your spirits! I am a classical musician and find this cd wonderful! It is so nice to see a great rock 'n roll musician produce such a beautiful expression of emotion that is the complete opposite of his everyday talent! As if written from his heart, Joel has given us classical music that does not take a trained ear to listen to. It is simple to understand and therefore, much more appealing to a larger audience. Not everyone understands or cares for highly intricate classical, and I find this cd lighthearted and very entertaining! Wonderful dinner music for dinner parties or just that private romantic dinner for 2. Belissimo!"
5,Superb CD ... a MUST BUY for all music fans,"This is one of the most pleasant and pleasing records I have ever heard. John's warm vocals are pleasant and soothing. His voice is a charm. And he's a very handsome, well dressed man!The rest of his ensemble on this record represents the best music has to offer today. From Ray Kennedy on piaino, to Daniel Jobim on back-up vocals, to John's brother Martin on Bass. Truely spectacular!!!!Also dont miss Martin's record, TRIPLE PLAY!"
2,Building dweller,"Have it standing for a week now. It went off without trapping anything. Mice are very fast, it can run out before the door closes. Need a faster mechanism than a free-falling door."
4,Quick Green Tea,Excellent product easy to prepare not bitter like brewed green tea good tasting convenient healthy and well worth trying
2,Poor E-Book Photo Illustrations,"In a book like this the photos are as important as the text. The photos in the E-book edition are dark, muddy copies with artifacts from a printed edition..."
2,Kinda Boring,This book is not what I expected. It is more of a history lesson than an adventure guide.
3,"Gorgeous, but not what I was after","Ive loved the work of syd mead ever since I first saw the movie blade runner. Since then I knew I wanted to be a concept artist. So I figured, what better way of becoming one, than studying the art of the masters? Hence, I bought this book.Only giving this book 3 starts feels kinda sad, since the works are gorgeous and the concepts, amazing! nevertheless... I was searching for rougher material... less color, more testy stuff. For you who want to be inspired as a concept artist, as I did, buy some ""the art of starwars"" books instead, they rule. On the other hand, if youre just lookin for a bunch of pretty work. BUY THIS."
5,DJ Clue Mixes Iz 2 Tight!!!,I like dis album but 2 all tha haters that said tha album could have been better wuz up wit ya'll? I mean damn ya'll aint got nuttin else 2 say but it could have been better ya'll do'nt know what real music is on da really.
2,"Good, but not real","Sure, the CDs good Theres some good rappers on it. But its not real. The guy comes in like Puff Daddy's album, where every single track is a sample. The guy doesn't make his own music, he doesn't rap on any of the tracks, I don't know why he thinks he has the right to name it after himself"
5,Easy wire,I used this harness on my 2003 Dodge Ram Regular Cab. Worked liked a charm! It even has the wire diagram on the back of the package so if you need it... just be careful not to tear the wire diagram print when you open the package....The print is on the package itself. For those of you that don't know what to do with the extra wires you have left over...the wires are for add ons like the T.V. or Navigation system or a back up camera. If you do need them don't hook it up. Just insure that you cut the wire down or use electrical tape or plastic covers to cover the wires that are not needed. The great thing about this harness is that the wires come pre-sliced already....This was great for me since I hate splicing wire. Also every wire is already pre-labled for what the wire is intended for.
2,OK for entry level reading,"It's a good summary book for entry level reading. All basic Oracle report features have been addressed, an ok handbook for client/server report developers.However, I can't see much, if not any, difference between that I call this book as Oracle Reports 2000/4.5/5. There's no knowledge of internet,Web Server,XML,or any useful infomation of 6i - the word 'i' means internet.There's almost no a word to mention how Oracle Reports unite with other Oracle tools such as Oracle Database, Forms, Portal, etc.A good reading for entry level to taste the powerful of Oracle Reports."
1,Terrible- Ripped after 3 uses,This product isn't worth the box it came in. Why can't people develop a product that lasts?? I used this suit just walking on the treadmill and it ripped after 3 uses.
5,Saying yes to saying no,"If you regularly find yourself saying ""Yes"" to others when you really want to be saying ""No, no, no!"" The Book of No may be just what you need. The theme at the heart of this book is the eye-opening truth of ""When you say yes continually to others, you say no to yourself.""After shedding some light on why it can be so easy to fall into the yes-trap, Susan helps light the way to the path of saying no. In addition to providing 250 instructive and entertaining just-say-no scenarios, Susan's book is packed with hard-hitting insights including: ""Each time you agree when you don't want to, you give up a piece of yourself"" and ""No is the cornerstone of self-respect and your gateway to being able to concentrate on what makes you feel better and more in command of your life.""The Book of No is certainly a read worth saying yes to!"
1,How To Be A Mean Bastard,"Read this only if you want to learn how to be mean to your friends, get fired at your job, and start fights with your kids. Most of the recommendations are just too mean to say to people."
3,good product,"I like the product and the promptness of getting it. Shipping cost much to high,will not order from them again.ridiculous"
1,"Victor, Come On...","If you are a musician, you will get bored with this CD real quick. There is very little here musically. I'm a bassist - and I admit that Victor is a virtuoso on the bass - but how long can you listen to someone slapping at 100 miles per hour? It gets boring real quick. One bright spot is Marcus Miller. He joins Victor on one track and he still has it all in my opinion - funk, substance, intelligent musical expression. This CD is chock-full-o simple chords, corney crowd chatter, and moronic dialogue between musicians. No lie, one song repeats ""What did he say"" over and over for 5 minutes while they hang on one chord. Come on Victor! I'll make sure I stay home next time you're in my town."
1,Angles and Demons the True Conspiracy,"Don't wast your money. I have seen better. The accented voice was hard to understand with the continued electronic type music blarring. The continued psychedelic images were distracting. Some didn't even make any sense to what was being narrated. It did get better 3/4 into the video, but still not worth it."
2,Didn't Learn anything new in 45 minutes so we burned it in the fireplace,"We were curious to learn about the free masons in our community so we bought this video. The movie started way back in history and kept showing witchcraft signs and what the guy was saying didn't make much since to us simple folk. Then, we saw our little terrier dog bounce up and down on the couch as if something was lifting her up and down. Once we saw that, we decided it must have some kind of witchcraft or spirits in it, and since we were bored with it anyhow we threw it in the fireplace."
4,"Angels, Demons and Freemasons",Learn about all aspects of ancient secret societies. And the sacred knowledge they have been keeping secret for so long. An interesting look at how secret societies show the true nature of man.
5,Great Reding,"Gabe just like the rest of the Buckhorn Brothers is worth buying! They are all awesome guys with really great stories. Each brother is different but they are all are hot, sexy and romantic. Anyone who reads these books will fall for them."
5,He'll get under your skin,"Picture Joxer the Mighty, almost stark naked, and psychotic. If ever there were anyone who could surprise you with his versatility, it's Ted Raimi. His character, Dennis Skinner ranks right up there with Hannibal Lecter and Patrick Channing. An innocent looking nice-guy, Ted Raimi will most definitely disturb you with his not-so-nice-guy behavior once the lights go out. A great movie, especially if you like blood & gore. They don't skimp on the skinning either. I recommend it for anyone's horror movie collection. ~SerialZero"
2,skinner,"I only bought this dvd because ted raimi was in it, don't get me wrong seeing him semi naked was fanastic but the quality of this disc is terrible as after three plays it is jumps and pausing when it feels like it. Very disappointed about the quality, but I am still happy as the overall movie is interesting."
1,Broke first time used,Bought this to measure a baseball field. Center field is 400 feet. I unrolled the tape for the first measurement and the part which holds the tape to the reel was broken or broke right off. The result is that I have 400 feet of tape in my field with no way to roll it up to reuse.
3,"Aww, ok I guess","This probably would work well to use as it was intended and only occasionally. I, however, don't buy something unless I use it up. The center is coming apart and there really isn't much of a bearing system for the spool. Admittedly, I have probably had it unwound and wound back up well over a hundred times. I figured this on being a cheaper alternative to the move expensive counterparts so I bought two. It will last until I wear it out or somebody releaves me of it and I will open the next one. About what I expected so I should give it more stars but ""you get what you pay for.*""*Phrase used in the sense as millions others have in online forums to denote- its cheap, expect it to work a few times and move on with life."
1,good idea bad quality,Concept is wonderful and it works. The problem is the quality. I have gone through two in as many weeks because the cheap white plastic housing filled with lotion cracked and split spewing lotion all over the bathroom.
2,Battery Life sucks,"Purchased this player to take with us for long trips for our son. The battery life sucks on this thing. Even when fully charged, you're lucky if you get 20-25 minutes of play time. Also when plugged into the wall it makes the funny buzzing noise and it doesn't fully charged when plugged into the wall socket either. It seems to be better if you plug into in the car and leave it to charge, but why should I have to leave my car on for an hour to charge this thing? It's also pretty bulky so don't let the pictures fool you. Seriously think about the other portable dvd players out there before you ""settle"" on this one."
4,"Looking for a different taste of jazz, hip hop and soul.","It's refreshing to hear a genre in the music industry that has'nt been taited by the formula that if a certain sound sells jam it down the publics hears regardless of substance. The best of this Acid Jazz delivers especially for those who can appreciate jazz instrumentation,a solid hip hop back beat,a latin soul groove, funky club mixes and mellow R&B vocals all together in one style of music. This music brings everything to the table and can be enjoyed in any setting, I purchased six CDs so far in this series including the Verve Remixes and I will tell you that after hearing these tracks smooth jazz sounds like the high school band."
2,Ho Hum,"I only managed to get about halfway through this book before giving up from boredom. I have cruised several times and unless you are wealthy enough to book the top suite on the boat without a second thought, there is not much commanality to be had here.I would not reccommend it to first time cruisers unless they understand that most of the amenities mentioned in the first part of this book are not available to them. Examples being express pesonalized check in and preferred spa treatments. You will wait in long lines and staff will not be falling all over themselves to assist you. The way this cruise is described the crew was practically bowing and scraping every time these people asked for anything or even walked on a deck.Don't get me wrong. Crew members are generally polite and helpful, but not as eager to ask how high to jump as described herein.I will utilize the idea of taking our own coffee mugs, but that is all the help this book was to me."
3,Disapointing Whoopi movie,"As much as I love Whoopi, and love Christmas (movies), I have to say I found the movie disappointing because the script wasn't funny, and so Whoopi had little to work with... it wasn't even amusing for that matter. I suppose I was looking for a movie to match the humor and good feeling and emotion of 'Sister Act' (1 and 2). And this wasn't it! I also have to say that I was bothered by Santa being willing to mass-market sell ANY toy on a home-shopping network that he is told to except just one - in order to just get close to Whoopi, a message that negates the better message found in the much better, older version of ""Miracle on 34th Street"". The best part of movie are the Garth Brooks songs (who partially produced this movie), but even HERE I was dissapointed in that I had hoped they would work Garth into the plot line as a character, or just make an appearance IN the movie to sing one of the Christmas songs."
1,Don't waste your money,"I love Laurie Berkner and have thoroughly enjoyed what I've seen of her on Noggin. This video was a HUGE disappointment. The sound is bad, the videography is worse, and the special effects are awful. I truly wish I hadn't wasted my money on this one. Don't waste yours."
2,We love Laurie but this video is awful!,"We bought this video because we love watching Laurie on NOGGIN. These are NOT the same videos! This is a video of a ""live concert"" at what looks to be a birthday party. The sound isn't very good, the animation is just plain bad and my 1 y/o is not interested in it at all. If she hears the ""move to the music"" intro on NOGGIN she will run in to the living room and dance around while watching the Laurie videos. She walks away from this tape.Don't waste your money folks, just tape them off NOGGIN like we did and buy the CDs. Your child will be happier and so will your pocketbook."
4,Disappointing production,"My kids and I love the songs from Laurie, Susie, and Brian (and I can't usually stand ""kids"" music), so I was thrilled to find this compilation. We were all pretty disappointed at the quality, but in 2001, it was probably done out of someone's garage. I usually just turn off the TV, and leave on the stereo, so I don't have to get annoyed by it. It would be so great if an update were put out that's more studio quality, without the party dresses. Regardless of the quality, I'll take it over Barney or Disney tunes ANY day!"
3,Laurie Berkner video,"My son is 15 months old and absolutely loves Laurie Berkner. He has seen her on the kids network Noggin and always dances and laughs with her songs. This video has all the songs that he loves, however it is basically a video tape of one of her concerts. There is a very ametuer feel to the production. It would be great to get her songs on video in a way that would be both visually and musically entertaining. Hopefully, she will release something better in the future."
3,Important book,"A very sensitively written book for children. Children have a great capacity for liking other children, looking for their companionship, for their trust. Very much like their parents, the ""older"" children. (Except Mom and Dad are very wary of their peers, in that ""trust"" department).What I find a little awkward here - maybe I have to re-read the book three times - is why Kate would be that mystified by another kid whose only outward sign of ""slowness"" is just that he spends more time with his Mother than other kids.Also, a girl under 10 is not very inclined to seek out *boy* friends. She might enjoy being with him, just...*like* him...but would not spend alot of time deciding whether to add the boy to her group.In the end, the book is more about her adjustment to him. I did not sense any adjustment of Timmy to...her. Timmy, inside, is the same as Kate.Still, the work is moving. I may look out for several more in this serious. Artwork wonderful."
3,Bally Ped A Bike,"I guess you get what you pay for. It is not a bad item, but it is really hard to keep it from sliding while you are using it. Also, I have had to tighten the bolts frequently."
3,Different Seasons Of Life,"Jacetta Williams (aka Jaci) met Maxie Jackson and thought she had found the love of her life. It wasn't until the day she told him she was pregnant that he admitted to her he was a married man.Trusting God every step of the way, this young, single mother worked hard to make sure her daughter had what she needed. Years later independent Jaci met J.P Gilmore. With him it seemed to be love at first sight but after the way Maxie had treated her, Jaci was hesitant to start a relationship. J.P. was persistent and Jaci eventually let down her defenses. Still, with love in her life things weren't always good. However, as ""seasons"" of life changed her faith in God remained.This book started out pretty good, then it got slow to where I was about to lose interest, but then it picked up again. There was repetivness in the story - especially when it came to the Maxie character - but there were also a few unexpected events that livened things up."
1,Go with a USB adapter,This is a real primitive method for 9 pin serialYou are much better off to go with a USB serial adapter.
3,"Move Along People, Nothing New Here","First let me say that this is not a bad CD. Solid guitar licks with fairly typical vocals. This was my first into to Tinsley Ellis, and while it was a good performance, it certainly doesn't stand out from a hundred other electric blues discs (hence the 3 star rating). You want some guitar based electric blues that make a real impression, check out something like Son Seals' ""Live and Burning""."
5,really good live blues/rock,"Tinsley has been slinging blues for some time now, and his experience shows in this live recording. Excellent guitar playing along with a good voice. I put this album on and couldn't turn it off, just had to listen to the whole thing."
5,Just Blown Away,I have all of Tinsley Ellis's CD's but this will now rank as my favorite. Can't stop playing it. I was completely blown away by the live version of Pawnbroker. I replayed it three times in a row. My only wish is that the concert had been recorded on DVD as well so that I could enjoy seeing it as well as listening to it.
2,Foot Pedals May Not Be Adjusted,"The blocks get a five star rating for portability, stability, and ease of setup. I enjoy the light weight. However I can only give them two stars because the foot pedals are not adjustable. The fixed pedal changes the angle at which I roll out and it is not comfortable. I wish that I knew about this prior to purchase."
1,Flaky switch,I bought two of these. One of them seems to work well. The other seems to have developed some problem with the switch mechanism after a few weeks because I need to turn it about twenty times before the light stays on without flickering and going off.The clamps are very sturdy and work great - think I might just go find myself a new switch mechanism to replace the stock one on it.
4,Gets hot,"I use this on my vanity mirror and it works great. It clips right to the top center of the mirror. My only complaint is that the light gets hot, but the switch to turn it on and off stays cool."
1,Now that is a Fantasticar!!,This is one toy that many boys and girls will enjoy. This special vehicle can be 2 different types of a fantasticar. It can be a little challenge to put together but still is alot of fun.
5,Best Christian Rock Band On The Planet,"Yeah, that title about sums it up. Just bought the CD at Corner Sone FL 3 days ago while pre-ordering thier new cd, go to fireflightrock.com and do so now i was the first, you can follow my lead, along with recieving the EP to said new cd at the same time. I have listened to both cds about 300 times already. Dawn is just about the best female vocalist on the planet.If you like Evanecessence, Plumb, Tsunami Bomb, Flyleaf or anything like them, but Fireflight, they are far better. 5 stars is no where near enough."
5,Definitely a keeper,"This is one of my favourite books ever. It makes one think and leaves one feeling more knowledgable after reading. I was pleasantly surprised upon realizing that I enjoyed this tale. Barney goes through so much and the ending leaves you breathless. If ever you want to be proud of reading a book and understanding it, try this one!"
5,Power increase,"The throttle response has been sharpened considerably over the stock coil. With new plugs, fat 9mm wires, performance cap (Accel) and the coil my 1994 E150 runs like it has 25,000 miles instead of 148,000. Nice upgrade."
2,Cover photo is deceiving,"As an architectural (and photo) enthusiast, I ordered this book and was immediately and severely dissapointed. The photos throughout the book don't showcase architecture very well, nor do they highlight ""new classicism"" in my opinion. The worst thing is the quality of the photos and printing. I returned this book immediately and would not recommend it, not even for a coffee table book."
4,Good Job Fab Job,Very informative ....good purchase it really is helping me with my business start. Looking forward to a successful adventure. THANKS
5,Awesome Guide!,"This book is packed with all sorts of info. on starting a wedding consulting business. I've read other guides, but this was covered ALL areas of wedding planning as a business. The CD was also an awesome bonus!"
5,A fast but good read,"This book was thought provoking in that it explores the issues of loneliness and what it means to be different. People who are different are afraid to show that side of themselves because when they do they often get burned by the ones they thought they knew. This book is about one persons experiences and decisions that go along with being different and how she deals with it in an ""ordinary"" world. It is an interesting read because there is a slight mystery of who those companions are but more interesting is why they do what they do. It isn't always fully explained and I like that because it leaves more to the imagination. And in the end we are left to wonder what happens. We have to fill in the ending ourselves but not in an altogether frustrating way, more like in a I like to think I know what happens kind of way (if that makes any sense). I would definitely recommend this book to those who wonder what if..."
4,A GOOD READ.,"The book is an interesting read. The monsters were a little off kilter for me, but the main character (monster) was pretty good. I enjoyed reading this book and I think you will too. Thanks."
1,NOT UPDATED,"This book has not been updated in YEARS. I am in the middle of a 3-week road trip around Italy, and this book has been useless. Actually, it's as heavy as a pile as bricks and I'm considering abandoning it somewhere so I don't have to lug it around the rest of the trip. Everywhere we have gone (Puglia, Pescara, Vicenza, etc etc) I have looked up restaurants and food shops in this book, and hardly a single one of them has still been in business. Most of the listings are OLD- old phone numbers, wrong addresses, wrong information (he writes that one town is 5 miles south of Vicenza, when it's actually NORTH). Many of the places, especially in southern Italy, are no longer even open. This book has NOT been updated and/or revised in years. Save your money, and don't buy this book."
1,Italy for the Gourmet Traveler,"I have two earlier editions of this book; I could not wait for the new one to come out. I spend four months in Italy each year and have used Plotkin's notes extensively. I was so disappointed I returned the book. He had not updated many places, restaurants etc. that have changed over the last several years. One should use another guide book that is kept current. This is out of date in too many places."
5,The bible for eating in Italy,"If I had only one book to take with me when travelling in Italy, this would be it! Fred Plotkin's taste is impeccable. He's not a snob, and although not adverse to the occasional expensive restaurant, he generally leads you elsewhere: to the local trattorias that serve up sublimated versions of the local, home-cooked cuisine. His adjunct entries (food stores, markets, etc.) are also wonderful and fascinating. Some of the entries are out of date, but this is still essential for any food-loving traveller (and why go to Italy if you're not?)."
5,Italian Cuisine,My daughter's husband is in the Air Force and they have been assigned to Aviano Air Base in Italy. I bought Italy for the Gourmet Traveler for her birthday gift.We loved the format and used the book continuously while I was there helping them transition to a new country. She loved her birthday gift and I know they will use the book while living in Italy for the next 3 years. I look forward to using it as a resource when we visit every summer! Great buy if you are planning a visit to Italy!
2,Very Disappointing,"I loved ""O"" but ""9"" is a poor follow-up. Not one track lives up to the standard of his first album. Damien seems to have run out of melodies and the lyrics are often pretentious and immature. If you are discovering Damien Rice for the first time, I recommend starting elsewhere."
4,A beautfiul album,"If you were to ask me which song on this album is my favorite, I would give you reasons as to why any of these songs at any given time could be my favorite. I know I'm one of the few who likes this album better than O, but I do, and I'm not going to apologize for it.Everyone can say that 9 isn't as daring, or it's not as complex, or the songs on 9 are friendlier, but you can not say that he does not sing his heart out on any song he records. He pours every ounce of his soul into these songs and because of that he is giving Dylan and The Decemberists solid competition for album of the year."
4,"High contrast to ""O"" that renews my interest in artist","It was with a bit of trepidation that I purchased this CD, since I had heard mixed reviews from friends and read several negative reviews from critics. I fell in love with a couple of songs on ""O"" and found many of the others simply okay. But I decided to purchase ""9"" after listening to short sound clips from a couple of songs.It definitely did not disappoint. Haunting, moving, rousing, heart-breaking...these are some of the words I would use to describe the songs. I think this CD is a bit more raw and definitely has an edgier, harder sound on a couple of songs.I would recommend it, especially if, like me, you found ""O"" just a tiny bit boring after a few listens. I think this CD will manage to hold my attention quite a bit longer."
5,On the uses of torture,"This story is one of the most vividly disturbing I have ever read. Many of the stories are like this, some are very compelling and all are wonderful intoduction to the mind of Piers Anthony."
2,Lamenting Lamentations,"I purchased this book specifically to teach through Lamentations, and I was sorely disappointed. Only 23 pages are devoted to Lamentations, and the commentary is superficial and unorganized. One of the key characteristics of Lamentations is its acrostic nature, but the author doesn't even mention this except as an aside in the middle of the discussion. The author includes a couple of historical anecdotes to make the book ""relevant"" to modern life, but their relevance to the actual text of Lamentations is questionable at best.I have not yet read the Jeremiah commentary, but if you are looking for help with Lamentations specifically, as I was, look elsewhere."
3,beads for fun,"This is bead set I ordered for my daughter. We used them, only problem the beads I ordered did not look like the beads I ordered. But, we used them anyway. I recommend that you ask if the beads you order look like the ones in the picture"
5,A Total Workout!,"I have had my set for two years and I love it! I have been working out everyday in my pool since May and have had amazing results. All of my friends are wanting to know what I have been doing. I had a membership to Curves and adapted some of those exercises to my Water routine. Who needs a bunch of gym equipment or a membership to a gym. All you need is a pool and this set and you can get a total workout! I have joint issues and fibromyalgia, and this had been the only form of exercise that I can do without pain. I have been recommending this set to all of my friends who are now wanting to start their own water workout."
4,Ole time cooker,"I needed to re-learn how to use a 6 qt pressure cooker that had been setting on my shelf for 20 years! Good book for this; recipes good, as well."
3,Good buy for the money...,"Good buy for the money, but don't expect much from the bag. The bag didn't stay on very long, but when it was attached all of the dust just blew right through the fabric as if the bag didn't even exist."
1,give me a break,its just a damn cable and i don't like explaining my self it didn't come on times if i didn't have to fill this out you would have gotten 5 stars
1,did not work,"I got this for a 2012 jeep grand cher, it does not work for my year, the discription would leed you to beleive it works,"
1,Don't buy it,"I put this on my wish list and got it for Christmas. It hardly worked the first time I tried to use it, as the sound was very low. Eventually, I got the CD to work--once. That's it, it never worked again. The sound dwindled to zero and I replaced the batteries. Then, only the radio worked, then died, and now I have nothing. It doesn't even make any noise. I've looked all over for a warranty for this thing, but I can't find it anywhere, and it should be listed on the Web.This thing never worked and now only a few months after Christmas, it's as dead as a doornail. Don't waste your money on this."
5,Great feature-rich phone with a great price tag,"Better battery life, range, and sound quality performance than the Panasonic and Uniden similar products. Really one of the best deals in the market; you get a lot of bang for your buck. We use this for home offices as an all-in-one solution and it's worked flawlessly. An added bonus - the design rocks and it saves a ton of space."
1,Buy something else,"I bought this phone because I needed a quick replacement for another cordless. First of all it was cheap didn't think it would be so bad. I was mistaken. After the usual 1st time charge, the reception was terrible. Tried to use it the next day the reception was still bad and people on the other end barely could hear me.Needless to say, I returned the phone the next day."
4,GE 26998ge1 900 MHz Analog Cordless Phone,This product was shipped to me right away and was properly packaged upon arrival.The cordless phone and digital answering system are brand new and work perfectly.
2,Problems w/ Buttons,When I first brought this phone home it was wonderful. It was very compact and it had the caller ID and answering machine. After about 8 months I noticed that ALL of the numbers on the headset were VERY hard to push. After having the phone a little over a year I have noticed that it looses its charge very quickly. I would only recommend this phone if you need it for something to &amp;quot;hold you over&amp;quot;.
1,Must be positioned perfectly to work,"These are honestly more trouble than they're worth. I've worked with plenty of toggle bolts for work, and these are by far the least user-friendly. If the screw isn't positioned perfectly, the toggle wing doesn't flip down and you just rip right through the drywall. Call me dumb, call me impatient, but these are way harder to get right than the standard 1/2"" hole-requiring snaptoggles, and the hole ends up being exactly the same size anyway."
2,Waist of time and Money.,"I guess on the BIG screen these IMAX movies are some thing else, but the DVD version has little of the impaced of IMAX.The picture quality is up to VHS standerds. Sound is nothing speacial. On the plus side without the jewal case it dose not take to much space.For die hard fans of Wales only. As for the rest watch Discovery Channel."
2,Show us your whales!,"I'd estimate about 10% of this film's footage actually shows whales. The rest of the time your looking at boats and scenic shots. What you do see of whales often consists of flukes and spouts. Is it too much to ask of an IMAX film that they actually get in the water? Finally, on the shots where we do have closeups, the water is often quite murky."
1,Shoulda bought the other one,I bought this because of the slightly retro look--next time I'm going for function over form. It's super-cheap in more ways than one. Really doesn't work very well at all. Not recommended.
5,the album would collapse without the best song,"The best song being ""70X7,"" which has been compared to Taking Back Sunday's ""There's no i In Team,"" for its powerful depiction of a friendship lost to someone who sold out to fame. I barely heard any of the rest of the album aside from this song, but this song in itself is enough to make it worthwhile."
1,What Happened to My Band,"What happened to the Brand New that I grew up loving? The deep, emotional, meaningful lyrics of ""The God and the Devil are Raging Inside Me?"" What happened to that heavy guitar and vocals from Deja Entu?"" Ugh, this is so poppy and such a horrible generic sound. Nice knowing you, Brand New. Your older stuff remains among my favorite music, but this is garbage. Lyrically and musically, this album belongs in the trash. I guess every great band puts out a crap album."
1,Got very noisy after about 6 months.,"I bought this Steinhausen watch winder because of the respected name and it was reasonably priced. It works for my Rolex but doesn't for my Seiko kinetic. So if your watch is truely a self winding one, this should work. If it relies on low voltage created by watch movement, then it won't. Besides that, after about 6 months, the ""quiet"" motor became too loud to keep in the bedroom."
4,Death on Horseback,"An informative perspective of the conflict between Native Americans and the army and settlers. The prose is not fancy but direct and full of details.While this is not a period of our expansion history we can be proud of, it is what happened historically."
2,Better then nothing,"So the heater/defroster in my car takes about 15 miles before it starts doing something, so I thought I would give it a try. It does not blow much air, but some slight modifications, blocking the output with some tape and adding a 12v CPU fan, made it decent. Don't buy this if you need to defrost a window. It takes about 5 minutes to defrost a 8in square at the bottom of your windsheild. I found the best use for this was to put it in my jacket and get the heat from the case, which gets quite hot.My final take: If you don't mind a small burn in your wallet, it works to keep you from freezing, but if you want to defrost a window, keep moving. (mind you I live in California and cold to me is below 40 degrees!!!)"
2,weak,"The manual states this heater is not meant to replace your vehicle heater, well no worries there. This heater is very weak and produces very little heat. I would not spend the money on this heater."
5,steve perry greatest hits+5 unreleased,"when will a new album come from the voice as other fans call him,columbia records are saying nothing.rumors say one is due out at the end of the year but until its in the local shop hold on.the track 'i stand alone' is the best to me on the album the way he sings those notes is unreal the style and so on. anyone wishing to get in contact with me please feel free to do so as long as you like steve perry and journey we can chat if not we wont. buy the cd as you will love it i swear by god. and let perry take you on a new journey with him as your guide.have faith."
5,Steve does it again,This CD is great. It not only has some of Steve's greatest hits it also has five unreleased songs. So it's almost like a new CD with songs that you haven't heard. This CD is a must for all the Steve Perry fans. I loved it.
2,died after 14 months,"We were satisfied with this phone for 14 months. Then one day we came home and there was a static sound coming out of the speaker. It got gradually louder and then went silent. The loud beep when pressing keys is gone as well as the speakerphone and the caller ID. Unfortunately, it was covered by a 1 year warranty. Now we have to find a replacement."
2,So-so,"I like all the features of this phone, especially the great display and the automatic saving of phone numbers from your received calls. It's very easy to just save them into your directory.If only the sound quality were better. We've had it 2 years, and now there is static on the line and the speakerphone fades in and out.They don't make em like they used to."
1,poor quality,"everything works on the phone just fine out of the box (to those who disparage the unit being hard to read- just snap on the enclosed piece of plastic with legs to elevate the display... if you read setup instructions that are enclosed it is pretty plain to follow), however after only 5 or 6 months of use, the unit has completely failed. I cannot dial out or pick up an incoming call. the warranty (of course) has expired... so into the trash can it goes I guess. I expect more out of products than just a 6 month service life. stay away from this model and find a better quality alternative!"
3,Fly tying,"Book has good details, but lacks many of the flies I normally use and that are found in other books."
3,Lengthy Materials List,"I have both books by this author. They are very instructive and for the novice the first one is especially good as there are more individual steps illustrated. But each new fly described calls for nearly a completely different set of tying materials that the novice just won't have. One can spend literally hundreds of dollars just acquiring all of the different hackle types and colors, never mind the other materials."
1,This is not for Jing Gong G36,"well as I said this is not for Jing gong G36. PLEASE DONT BUY THIS, YOU WILL BE DISSAPOINTED. For example, the hole of bbs is in the other way of the original mag, and the worst part is that you could not fix it. So G36 airsofters dont buy this"
3,O.K For Price,"I got this item and was disappointed to see that it came in a Chinese package marked ""Toys!"" which made me think that I made a horrible buy. But the mag only holds around 30-40 rounds which is good for a beginner's airsoft war. Awesome feature that it has is that you can click it onto other magazines to make it a dual mag, triple mag etc. Good for a Double Eagle product."
5,Very good quality. Recommend.,Well made. Used it right away. No problems with it at all. Recommend it to anyone who is looking for this sort of item. Fast delivery also.
5,Excellent Customer Service,"When my package arrived it was in a complete mess, I was so disappointed. However, I should not have worried. I was contacted immediately by the vendor and a new shipment posted out without cost of any kind to me.5 star service in my book!!"
2,not great,"It's a cute idea, but the mat is way too small and now that my baby is six months old, the first thing she does when I put her down on the mat is to rip the bird off. I think it's going to be dangerous to have the plastic piece without the bird on it when she start sitting up since I can see it taking an eye out or something. I'm going to try to glue it on but for the price it shouldn't break so easily."
5,Six Stars At Least,"This release has drawn such universal praise that I won't go into detail here, save to say this is one of the most flat-out enjoyable music purchases you can make. This album is beautiful, it looks good, it sounds good, and it turns the spotlight back on a band that deserves more recognition than it often gets today. The Faces shouldn't be dismissed as a party band, a bunch of good-times boozers, their music was wide-ranging and at its best right up there with the best of the era. This album sets the standard for how a retrospective collection should be done, it is highly recommended."
5,A bargain!,"Let me put it this way - The live medley of ""Around The Plynth/Gasoline Alley"" is worth the 50 bucks alone - the rest of this incredible box set is included for free!"
5,"Epic, but liner notes elicited hangover","This is seriously good stuff, they do not make 'em like this anymore. Woody is a monster, the band is terrific and the singer could have a great solo career ahead of him.I saw these lads within two weeks of their last concert, about 30 feet away on Woody's side of the stage, and even at that young age (14) I think I would have recognized a bunch of drunken maniacs had they been situated thus.I write this because judging from the liner notes these guys did not miss a drink, even when they were asleep. I suppose that any such description of the bands of those days would be similar, though, and it doesn't really have a deleterious effect on the music that I can tell. But it does make for some seriously sodden reading......nice tributes from rockers who descended from them, though."
1,TARRIBLE,"I saw this movie a week ago on TMC and hated it!!!! The characters were twisted the plot was changed, in short it was tarrible. Mathew, Gilbert, and Anne were great, but everyone else got twisted characters or just did not look like the part at all. For one thing Marilla's character was horrible. You don't like her, I mean she's too mean! And the Berry's were bad. First of all, Mrs. Rachel Lynde's character is now Mrs. Barry the mother of Diana Barry. Second, Diana's traditional racen black hair is now BLOND!!! The movie is too short, they cut almost HALF of the book out. And that ending is tarrible, Marilla saying, ""I'm going to go fetch Gilbert."" or somthing like that. It happens too fast and is not a verry good quality of a movie. If you wan't to see a version of Anne Of Green Gables see the remake with Megan Follows. I would give that a 5!!!"
4,Guy's Reviews,"This is a very good starting point for anyone interested in the aquarium hobby. It has information on setting up both marine and fresh water aquariums, plus a section at the back of the book that gives an overview on the different families of fish, both fresh water, marine and brackish water fish. It is a very good for beginners however the main downside to this book is that it is lacking information about water chemistry. This book is not to be overlooked however if you are going to buy it you are best not to stop at buying ""only"" this particular book before setting up your aquarium."
5,Perfect for Jumbo Cookies,"I use the Nordic Ware Cake Lifter with my jumbo sugar cookies. After stamping out the shapes in the raw cookie dough, I needed something to move the shape to the pan. This lifter has been amazingly helpful in keeping the shape. It could be a bit thinner, overall, but as it is actually for use with cakes and they tend to be heavier than cookie dough, that doesn't seem to be a problem with product."
1,Don't Throw Away Your Money,"This tent may look cute, but the materials are really cheap and it really is so flimsy that it will fall down every time your child moves around in it. Instead of trying to take a break while your child amuses him- or herself popping in and out of this tent, you are constantly setting it up again after it falls over AGAIN. I kid you not, I think I was doing this once a minute for at one point. I finally gave up and had to stay inside, propping it up with my arms in order for it to stay up around my 3-year-old.I realize now in retrospect that the Ikea play tents have left me spoiled. If you want a tent that actually stays up, is constructed from much better material, and is half the price, go to Ikea. Avoid this tent, because you will regret it. I know I do!"
1,Flimsy and never stays up,"Be carefull when purchasing this product. I was confused the the fact that it says it uses EZ Twist technology. In fact it only uses that for the two side walls. However, because it doesn't use it for the front or back the thing doesn't stay up at all. To compenate for this they send two poles to stick in holes towards the top of the hideaway. Thus leaving the bottom without any support.In addition to this be very carefull when looking at the dimensions. This thing is deep and high for little kids but barely wide enough to fit one child.In short, don't waste your money on this garbage that doesn't fit more than two toddlers with no elbow room and falls down every time they move. You will end up spending your entire day putting it back up for them."
1,Save your money -- buy a different vacuum,"If you are looking for an ear-splittingly loud vacuum with a belt that slips off frequently, on-board tools that fall off as you use it, and a motor that burns out after 6 months, then this is the vacuum for you! Otherwise, I would strongly recommend that you get something else."
4,Powerful handheld devil,"After our ancient dirt devil died, we needed a new handheld vacuum with both a rotary function and a hose feature. While the new Ultra model's hose is shorter than the older version, ease of use and added motor power make up for this small issue. It's also a 2 speed vs. one speed vac. It's done a great job for about a month now and seems to be built well enough to last for several years."
1,Do *NOT* Buy this ...,"This thing is loud, heavy, cumbersome and it eats belts like there's a belt famine. It has basically blown out every time I have tried to use it. It is far more convenient and much less stressful to just haul out the big guns and just get the job done. From one vacuum junkie to another: leave this one on the virutal shelf. It was so much hassle that I didn't want to bother with the additional hassle of returning it. I'll never use it again."
2,Good on pet hair... until it breaks.,"I loved this for getting dog and cat hair off upholstery. It was loud and heavy, but I was so thrilled it worked I didn't care. Then the belt broke. We replaced it, but the thing never worked again. Also, when we ordered the roller for it, we never got it. Something more reliable next time."
1,disappointing.,"The switch between rotor and hose is simpler, but also prone to fouling and loss of suction on hose.Even at peak performance, this model is disappointing compared to older, lesser-powered models.It also runs hotter and makes noticeably more noise."
4,very good,i bought this after reading many reviews and found that they were all in 2 catagories either you loved it or you hated it. i am no exception i really like it. it works like a dream on plush high pile carpets that you can't really run a regular vacuum cleaner over. i don't have any trouble getting it to pick up dirt. the price was great (less than $30) and bags and belts are easy to find and inexpensive. it could have a little more suction in the hose for attachments but it still picks up dirt well. the best use i get out of it is the roller brush. the roller is very strong and keeps going even when used on deep pile carpets.
3,Good power but veeeeeery loud,"This little guy has good power, and does its job as advertised -- but it's also extraordinarily loud. We've finally decided to buy a different model, because it's just too painful to our ears."
1,Do not buy,"I wanted a handheld car vacuum. I only got this because it had a cord. I had a cordless Black and Decker which took forever to charge, so I exchanged it and got this.It is way too loud and it rattles pretty bad that others may find holding it a little bothersome.I must have vacuumed a little pebble in my car and it started smoking and now it's dead. Don't buy this."
5,dirt devil,These little vacums really do a good job ....would not be without one.....last a long time great for stairs ...furiture
1,Obnoxious Vacuum,"It's a pretty color and it's electric. These are the only nice things I can say about it. I had trouble getting the bag to stay on and it was VERY LOUD. It reminded me of the sound of a shop vacuum. This was THE MOST, obnoxious vacuum I've ever owned. If you want to be angry and frustrated, buy this vacuum. I took it back to the store."
3,"Great content, but...","It's really upsetting when you have to ride throughout the documentary feature in order to acess extras like videoclips and making of's.And the structure is not so functional after all: One of my DVD players considers the documentary feature as a Menu, hence I can't fast-forward or rewind it. And only the live recordings are accesible directly through the menu."
1,Subtitles,"I was excited to get Bimer until it arrived and I realized my edition had NO SUBTITLES although it clearly states that there are english subtitles on the website, I am seriously considering returning this ID unless I can find the subtitles."
5,Childhood Book,"I was thrilled when I found this old book that I have looked for on Amazon.com. I've searched for this in book stores and flea markets in my area for a long time. It completes my set of the Dr.Seuss ""I can read it all by myself"" books I had as a child. I was amazed at how good the condition of the book was when I received it. Excellent, in my opinion! Also, this was my first purchase from the internet and I was very pleased! I thank you for making my first time a good one. I will not hesitate to purchase through Amazon.com again. D. Mallory (IN USA)"
2,Air Defense Team/Star Saber.,"This toy changes into a sword for larger figures, but has no other redeaming qualities... The planes look nice, but other armada figures are better and have more thought and design put into them.Their small size and poor design makes them easy to break, makes their sword fall apart, and generally makes them fragile.Still, they are nice transformer toys which appear on the tv show, so that's got to count for something!"
1,If you just want a firewall,....download the free Zonealarm. It has all of the needed firewall features and costs nothing. I have used it for several years wtih no problems.
1,Zonealarm - poor customer support,"Tried the free Zonealarm download and loved it so decided to support the company by buying a licensed copy. The licensed copy of Zone Alarm Pro would not load; error massage stated my Windows XP was missing a necessary .dll file. Went to their website to diagnose problem and it turns out this is a common problem so I attempted to contact their customer support. When I did get a message through to them their response was totally useless. Tried some other options but got frustrated so I wound up with a $55.00 piece of software that I could not use. My overall impression of Zone Labs is that they produce a decent product but have a really lousy customer support mechanism in place to help customers through problems. It seemed to me that they didn't care that their product had a fatal flaw. As a result, I would NOT buy this product just on the principal that the company leaves you hanging when you shell out your hard earned money to buy their product."
3,Smooth!!!!!!!! Awesome!!,"I listen to this sometimes when I'm in the mood for some Smooth!! Jazz style! I got this CD because of his association with the Group ""Alabama"" and I knew how Good of a Musicain he was and I'm glad I got it!!"
4,"If you don't use backlit a lot, this is it.","If you use handheld just to manage database like I do, this product is a good choice. The price is reasonable, and the silver case is impressive. 8M is quite enough as long as I don't install a big dictionary. Still, here are some concerns I want to share with you:*the battery only lasts for two weeks instead of two months stated by Handspring (I am not a heavy user!). I got to get rechargeable AAA otherwise the bill for battery is unthinkable.*the screen got scratch easily. I only use it for two weeks and several scratches are found. I had to get WriteRight sticker to protect it.*the backlight doesn't function as good as Palm M500 series. If you need to use backlight function alot, don't take this one.Overall, it's a good product with reasonable price."
1,Customer service ??? What Customer service?,"I bought a Hanspring Platinium, and I get the worse Customer service or technical support following a problem, my recommendation is AVOID TO BUY IT"
3,Don't forget your earplugs!,"For the price I paid, I shouldn't have expected a perfect machine. For the most part it's functional. But it's just too darn loud. That, I think, is the biggest sacrifice to the god of affordability."
1,Don't buy this vacuum,Air blows out of it at the floor level so that the dust is blown away as you're trying to pick it up. It does not pick up in corners or up close to edges. The bag is impossible to insert properly. It is extremely loud. It's one good feature is that it is powerful.
4,Administración de Recursos Humanos,"El mejor y unico amigo de las organizaciones son el personal con que cuenta, de ellos depende que todas las actividades se lleven a cabo y se cumplan con el objetivo o meta prevista. La ARH es la encargada de buscar, integrar, mantener, evaluar y organizar al personal dentro de las empresa por tal motivo se considera de gran importancia para un eficiente funcionamiento de la organización."
4,This book help you guess on the SAT,This book is very good at helping you guess the right answers on the SAT. It features Joe Blogg who always misses the hard question and gets the easy ones. So if you are not really confident in taking the test and want to score higher on SAT you should get this book.
4,Cute toy,"I purchased this toy because I didnt want to spend $40 for the Drop and Roll Dino (which I really wanted) if my 9-month old didn't like it. She likes it, but its not her favorite toy. I showed her how to put the balls in the mouth twice, and she is a pro now. Other reviewers have said it falls over easily, but it stands up better than I expected. It is very lightweight plastic, but my daughter has yet to hurt herself on it, and she's constantly knocking it over (on purpose and accidentally). The one annoying thing about is the giggle sound only is activated on the top arm. I wish it was on all three. I think its good for the price, but since she's not that into it, I'm glad I didnt spend the money on the dino."
1,The Facewacker,"Yes this toy is a dreaded facewacker. Don't let your child play with it, it has no stability, as one reviewer noted it falls over, which direction is up to your child, ouch daddy my nose !!! double ouch, thanks amazon for charging shipping costs to return !!!"
2,Ok Toy Not His best by far..,My son got this for Christmas he is 8.5mths old.. he figured out how to work it straight away.. he did keep putting the balls in but i would say it will only entertain him for about 10mins or so.. i think the laugh and learn range of toys give him much greater entertainment.
2,Save your money,The locking mechanisms are flimsy.The handle dips deep into the cake space so a two layer cake (even a thin one) won't fit. It's fine for a single layer.The bottom has cracked diagonally through the center.
2,ALREADY CRACKED,There is no support in the center underneath to prevent cracking and eventual breaking. We end up just leaving the baked item in it's pan and covering it with 1 of the 2 parts this item comes with. The locking mechanism would be fine if it was on the opposite side; that way no cracking to the plastic.
2,CAKE CARRIER BASE CRACKED AFTER ONE USE,"I received my cake carrier on December 15, 2011. I have used the carrier once and was very happy with the looks of it and it did keep my cake very moist. When I was washing the bottom piece of the carrier,Nordic Ware Rectangular Cake Keeper, 9 by 13 InchI noticed a small crack in the bottom center where it has a small plastic dot. The carrier was not abused in any manner so I was very disappointed to find a flaw when I have only had it less than a month."
5,Very pleased with this humidifier.,"This is a great humidifier. I love that it doesn't have a filter, or any other random parts, to worry about replacing. Very simple. The maximum operation time for a full tank is 10 hours, which is perfectly fine for people who only need it at night. I also like the timer options and auto-shutoff feature, which my previous humidifier didn't have. It also doesn't have any sensitive parts that stick out (my previous one had a water level sensor that you had to be VERY careful about not toucing). There is no option to control the humidiity output, but I personally find that my average-sized room never gets over or under humidified. It's just right."
2,Flawed dvds,"The first dvd I bought of this movie was acting up, I figured it was just a bad dvd so I got another one and it was messed as well! They both freeze up or skip to different scenes! Which is really to bad, cause what I did get to see of the actual movie looked really good!! Maybe the vhs is not bad, but I would be leary about ever purchasing this movie again!"
4,great percussion,"-- Famoudou Don Moye: congas, karanjan, triangle, drums, vocal; Baba Sissoko: tama, n'goni, kamalen'goni, karanjan, bells, vocal; Maurizio Capone: congas, timbales, bells, steel drum, scatolera, scatolophone, canalina elettrica, vocal; with Aldo Vigorito: bass, vocal; Piero De Asmundis: piano, piano rhodes; Marcello Colasurdo: vocal; Fabiana Martone: vocal; Giovanni Volpe: surdo; Pasquale Panico: guitar"
2,Very disappointed,I have had a Stick Vac Plus for several years and was very satisfied with its ability to pick up sand and dog hair on a 600 ft slate floor. After looking for a new one for the last year I was pleased to find this one at Amazon.But after using it I was very disappointed. The primary drawback is that the Triangle Nozzle is smaller and does not swivel like the old one did. This means that it does not sweep corners well and is very awkward to move across the floor. The cord is not convenient because you have to loop it and hang it up. There is no way to hang up the vacuum and it falls down easily. The one good feature is the dust container can be emptied and does not require a bag.I was so disgusted wuth the new vacuum that I have put it in the garage and am again using the old one!I also sent a letter to Royal Applaince Co.The next time I'll pay better attention to the reviews at Amazon - Thanks for posting them.
1,Bad Feature,The cable management on this vacuum cleaner is very poor. That spoils what would be an otherwise good product
4,I'm hooked!,"I really like this product. I have color-treated hair & using this gives my hair more life, but using it too often will make it flat. I use it before I put my styling products in."
4,A Mulford fix.,"This book is not a Hopalong Cassidy novel. However, Clarence Mulford first attracted me with his wit and humor. The way he writes about the western cowboy invariably makes me smile as my mind wraps around his stories. All Mulford western books are a must, Hopalong or no."
2,Be Careful Before You Order,"Source of Life is a great product no doubt. These although are the CAPSULES, not the TABLETS. I should have read more carefully. It seems like a deal, but the serving size is 9 CAPSULES. It is only a 20 day supply and a mouthful to swallow. Other than that, you get the same energy boost as the tablets, just not as much bang for the buck. Even though they are cheaper by the bottle, the cost per dose is much worse with these."
5,ultimate survival tool,"when roughing it, or packing your BOB, make sure this nutritional essential is with you. water and beef jerkey only go so far."
1,All these reviews are confusing,"some are so glowing and positive and others are scathing. I don't know what to believe. I now take valium for my attacks and it works just fine and I'm used to it. Its also half the price of this product. I have also learned that ""homeopathic remedies"" are nowhere near what they're cracked up to be. I still side with the doctors and will probably stick with the ""real deal"". I am not all concerned with the controversy over prescription medications. Also, I do not use my prescribed meds on a daily basis. So, can some out there please tell me if is this worth a try? Or should I stick to what I know works? Again using prescription medications is not a problem in my book. Relief is the single most important thing."
5,Works,"Easy to install. Since these are the microfresh bags, people have told me that they do not hold as much in the bag so you have to change the bag more often but I think it is important to change the bag quite often whether is is full or not so it does not bother me. If you vacuum a LOT, for a couple more dollars you can get 10 bags of the non-microfresh. I do not notice a big difference between the micro and non-microfresh bags."
3,Yamamotoyama takes mediocre turn,"I wasn't fond of the raspberry flavored green tea. It doesn't measure up at all to their original green tea. It wasn't absolutely horrible and I did end up drinking it, but I was disappointed since I am familiar with some of their other products. If you want fabulous green tea, try the original first."
5,Good hungarian music,"So helpful for a young violin soloist to hear the music they want to play. This CD is it. Instead of a whole orchestra, it is the violinist."
3,"In 6 months, it scratched to the point we can't see the numbers!","My daughter loves the watch and wears it every single days for 6 months now, including swim lessons.I have to say, it is water resistant as advertized.But TIMEX, please, the kids need to have the scratch resistant crystal not some cheap plastic.I don't know if other kids are more careful with their watch (or not wear it often).Our watch is scratch so bad we soon won't be able to see the numbers!Now we have a dilema: my child loves the watch, it was her bday present, she thought it wass the best present ever. How do teach the kid to value something if it needs to be replaced in 6 months?So beware."
3,Great first time watch,"This watch was purchased for my 8 year old daughter. It has served her well. I would rate it at five stars but as other people mentioned, the strap tends to come off. This has not been a major problem with our daughter, it has come off about 3 times in 3 months and I have been able to pop it back in.I have watches of my own that perform very well but were purchased at a much higher price. At the price this was purchased, it is performing as just below expectations as noted with my three star rating."
4,Not bad.,"The program is capable of doing quite a bit, but if you are a professional builder you may need to do more than this program can. However it is a good place to start in order to learn how the product works. Chief Architect will give you a $500 credit if you have purchased this product and decide to upgrade to Chief Architect 10."
4,Nearly perfect case!,"This case looks sharp, holds the Visor well, holds cards, currency, etc. (there is a HUGE pocket across the entire inside), and does a great job protecting against shocks and casual water exposure.My two biggest concerns about it are:1. The big pocket. Opening the big pocket wide (to get money out of it, for example) presses against the Visor mount and allows the Visor to pop off. And you'll need to open it wide because it is so big that the bills settle deep down inside it.2. It is just a bit too big to easily be carried in a pocket. it offers a wrist strap, but it is hard to carry in a pocket, small fanny pack, etc., and you canot easily attach it to a belt, etc. This is NOT REALLY A PROBLEM if you are used to carrying a paper-based planner anyway, or plan to carry it in a purse, briefcase, etc."
4,Great Case,"I have this Visor case as well as the Hawaiian print version. I love them. They make it easy to identify my Visor if I've left it laying next to my husbands. It's fun to be able to coordinate the Visor to my purse or outfit.It protects the Visor well. My only problem is that occationally it's hard to get the pen out of the Visor. It's not difficult enough for one not to purchase it, however."
3,"Smaller than I expected, but small is good, right?","I was looking for a compact case, but this was a bit smaller than I expected. There is no room here for extra batteries if you like to carry spares, and a standard pen or mechanical pencil will be too long to fit in here either. That said, my case seems well made, with solid stitching and a heavy duty zipper.The retention system is not clearly explained in the description, so here goes... it's a sleeve of fabric inside the cover that you slide the Visor cover through, so the top and bottom are exposed. Then the Visor snaps into its own cover, either face up or face down. With it face up, for use, it is a tighter fit, but it feels sufficiently secure.By the way, the zebra print is on a fuzzy fabric that feels like you would expect a fake zebra to feel. Adds a nice touch of kitsch to the case."
4,Great Protection,This visor protector offers great reliable protection against bangs and dings in your favorite electronic equipment. This is great!
1,The Shari Lewis Collection,I was very disappointed with this product. The picture on the front shows Shari as she was in her 1990's series Shari Lewis and Lambchop. That;s the show I wanted DVD's for. I watched the first dvd and the show is stupid. My niece and I didn't like it. We used the watch the show in the 90's together.I can not find the invoice. How can I return it and get a refund?
4,Great little book,"I was very pleased to receive this little book, filled with great insights. It's such an easy read and very profound.A must read for anyone interested in a new look at meditation."
5,Great!,"I didn't know Anne Rice untill three weeks ago. I read her book 'Interview with a vampire' and i didn't stop reading untill i read it out. I love the story and the way she wrote it. The story is emotional, and sometimes a bit scary, but always beautiful, just like all of her other books. Anne, we love you!!"
4,"Delicious. A creative, expressive piece of art.",Anne Rice has reached the ultimate boundary of thrills with the vampire chronicles. I felt I was one with the characters. Each page brought forth Anne Rice's imagination on paper. One of the best series of the decade. Diana.J
1,"Very, Very, Very Bad. (Doesn't even deserve one star.)","Cinematic's throw-up. History's crap. The music sucks, and the plot is horrible. It was a Braveheart wanna-bee that could never stand up to it.First of all, the acting was mediocre, and the directing left a lot to be desired. What is going on with the storyline? Who? What? Oh my god they lost me again!... and I studied Roman history for a good portion of my life, so if anyone should be into a movie like this, it should be me.Secondly, and I am getting specific now, the Roman legions does not consist of 20 guys who are chomping at the bit to get laid. They wouldn't care if girls flashed them on a wall, and if they did, and broke line, the commander wouldn't smirk with entertainment. He would order the archers to KILL HIM on the spot! They didn't NEED to break line to flip out about breasts, they could (and always did) just have their way with them later.This movie was the biggest waste of 3 dollars EVER. Don't waste your time."
1,That almost beats U-571,"This film almost beats the worst war/history movie I have ever come across: U-571.Druids looks to me like a bad soap opera. The costumes looked as if the makers of this film have studied cartoons like ""Asterix and Obelix"" rather than history books.Christophe Lambert has played in a lot of good movies but also bad ones and this is one of his worst.Everything in this film just has the feel of being fake. The worst are the Teutons who are ALL shown red-haired. What a joke. Did they all fall into the same pot of red paint?Brandauer and his cynicism kept me going in that movie. This is how Caesar should be portrayed: as a ruthless, cynical, and ice-cold careerist politician who walks over corpses to achieve his political aims. That portrayal of Caesar in the film is good and historically accurate.The rest should be kept in silence.If the French ever see how the Gauls are portrayed in this film, the director will never be allowed to enter France again."
3,Take the good things from this movie,"It seems that historically based movies suffer from the critics as much as horror features do. While this is not an outstanding piece of cinema, it succeeds in showing the last days of the Roman campaign against gaulic celts. Acting is not very good (Christopher Lambert never been a good actor), but I liked the scenary and the movie pace. At the end, an entertaining movie where you learn some about the history of Roman conquest in western Europe. Lastly, a descent movie for the price."
2,Comically Bad,"I was expecting a bad movie, and this one really delivered.The dialog is super cheesy. Christopher Lambert had a rather unheroic portrayal of the heroic leader of the Gauls. The plot, while not complex, manages to be a little confusing. The movie moves slowly so my wife fell asleep, and I imagine most viewers would not make it to the end.Given my low expectations, I actually enjoyed this movie. The dialog was comically bad. There were some nice equestrian scenes, pretty vistas, and Klaus Maria Brandauer actually got into character as Ceasar. I am now reading more about Vercingetorix, who was so poorly portrayed in this laughable film."
1,disappointing,I was really disappointed with this book. It was so depressing that even the ending couldn't help it. Unfortunately for me I read more of her books and haven't found one yet that I liked.
2,My first Ashley book.,"I found Shades of Gray to be extremely marginal. I found myself skipping over sections, which I rarely do. The Grigori was yet again another typical vamp, a gorgeous mysterious dead old guy falling for a sweet young thing, in this case Marissa. There was nothing about Marissa that explains why she was the one to evoke his long dormant passions, unless it was that she didn't immediately fall in bed with him. On top of that, when the wife that he's grieved for and tried avenge for centuries ends up being still alive, he picks Marissa. I was hoping that Marissa would smarten up and choose the vampire hunter instead. I admit I may be a little bit jaded since I read 5-6 books a week, but there are definitely much better vampire romances out there. Save your money on this and use it to buy one of those instead."
1,Waste of money,"Our dog didnt even go near this, it was like she would pee everywhere EXCEPT where the pee post was. I even tried moving the dog poop near it.....still didnt work. I just wasted my money. I've just come to the conclusion that dogs go to the bathroom wherever they want. Im done trying to change that, its to stressful!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I had high hopes for this product, but it was totally ineffective! In fact, my two dogs wouldn't go near it (no pun intended)."
1,Does not work at all!,"I tried this for my 6 month old Golden Retriever puppy because I was starting to see burn spots on my lawn and was hoping to ""contain"" the area where she was doing her business. NO LUCK WHATSOEVER. It was totally a waste of money. And, it turns out a little extra watering got rid of the spots...not to mention, she basically goes all over the lawn and not in one particular area. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
3,Roseanne Barr My Life as a Woman,"The book was good, but it fell apart as I was reading it--luckily I didn't care because I wasn't going to re-read it or pass it along."
4,This sword is a good buy,"It's nice and sturdy. I've really enjoyed it. It doesnt break easily, my sis has bent it in half multiple times. Not a dent on it. Nice and lightweight, too."
4,Good variety of Nickelodeon Cartoon music,"With rambunctious boys, age 4 1/2 and 3...they need high energy and age appropriate music to get the 'wiggles' out! This cd fits the bill. They love it so much that they ask for it by name. The only con is that some of the other favorite Nick cartoons like Jimmy Neutron is not on this CD. Other than that, it is an excellent value and loads of fun to dance to!"
1,Sad,"This is not agood IZ,SB & FOP cd.If your a fan of those show don't buy this cd!!!!!(Zim,Spongebob & Timmy destroy all the cds)"
5,Excellent and Easy to Use,"This little gadget is so compact and easy to use.My boyfriend picked it up for me yesterday.I have an Olympus 550,3mpxls that I received as a Christmas present.Last night I got a chance to print several pictures and the quality (rich,vibrant colors)was excellent!!I brought my pictures to work this morning, and my fellow co-workers loved them!The first thing they said was how excellent the colors were.I don't like grainy pictures and there were none.Be prepared to spend some good money, the ink cartridge and photo paper, as well as buying batteries for your digital will cost you.But that's the price you have to pay if you want excellence.I also recommend buying HP photo paper w/tabs."
1,Sad to return it,"I bought this little printer so I can print my 4X6 photos from my Compact flash card. The LCD was a little grainy, but worked ok. I had so many problems with the printer itself. 1/8 of an inch on side is totally white, not boarderless printing. The lady at HP tech support told me that was normal and that I can just ""cut"" that off. I can understand tearing the tap off of the top of the page, but get real. She said I should go out and buy a paper cutter! :-? And some of the photos were not even printing straight. Very UNIMPRESSED with their technical support. I feel using Ofoto.com or Snapfish is more economical than this. Plus you dont have to cut the pictures when you get them. :-( Really wanted this to work."
4,"Some timeless essays, some dated","This collection of essays is pretty readable for a work published in the 60s. It's also amazing how much the debate has stayed the same - it still pits libertarians against cultural conservatives, with some of the essays in this book (Hayek's ""Why I Am Not a Conservative"", for example) remaining as crucial texts today. The authors in this book who remain famous are Hayek, Ropke, Garry Wills, William F. Buckley, Jr., and Russell Kirk. Unfortunately, the others are mainly of historical interest. All in all, it's worth reading just to see how timeless some of these arguments are and to see arguments of these important thinkers."
3,"Waiter, humor & pathos for sure!","Good book, i read all books related to this subject, being in the business its easy to relate. Actually just eating out should make it relate-able, its the same everywhere, and the diners are very much the same no matter where you live or dine! Makes me laugh, that in this business 'stero-typing' is a sure bet each and every time. I purchase all my books at Amazon & happy to know you can also sell them back to Amazon!"
2,Great Concept. Poor Delivery.,"Having been a long-time fan of GMCLA, I have to say I'm severely disappointed in the quality of this recording.Problems start with the selection of material. With such a heavy focus on Merrily We Roll Along and Sweeney Todd, you get a feeling a concert version of these shows was their true interest. Sweeney in particular takes up a full fourth of this performance with selections (Wait and These Are My Friends???) that aren't particularly suited to choral arrangement.Problems continue with the quality of the chorus as a whole. I was surprised to hear the group's tone drifting noticeably flat repeatedly. Arrangements that seem to favor disonance over harmony don't seem to help matters.Then there's the odd and out-of-place bits of lyrics spoken instead of sung as a seque between the numbers. The rhyming structure makes them sound forced and unnatural when spoken.On a whole, a big disappointment from a chorus I've often lept to my feet after hearing."
1,Diluted & Misleading,"If you're not well-versed in Political Thought & Theory, it's best to steer clear of watered down biased productions of this sort. If you are well-informed, biased and diluted productions of this sort are a waste of your time."
3,not as good as brewed,"I was really hoping to use this as a substitute for brewed iced tea, but for me it isn't. The taste is only fair and the powder doesn't completely dissolve. I had been thinking I would add it to bottled water when away from home but I have decided to order some Ito En Green Tea, a bottled brewed green tea, from amazon for this purpose."
5,awesome,"Louie Devito is so talented. His cds are great, this cd is my favorite. I take it to the gym with me every day!!!!"
4,NYC UnDeRgROuNd,"Volume 4 is no doubt the best! When i listen to it, i jus wanna get up n dance! Louie DeVito is an awesome DJ, and this is his best work! BUY IT!"
4,Mix it up,NYC Underground is all about techno. It has a nice mix of different beats (although some sound similar) and makes for a great work out partner.
1,REALLY UGLY,"One deceptive thing about the ad above is that the picture shows the palm head on. There is a reason for this. The faceplates cover only half of the palm. The front. From any othe angle, you will see that putting on a colored faceplate (which is stupid to begin with, considering a pink palm would be repulsive anyway) leaves you with a Half Black, Half colored palm. I would actually give this -43 stars if I could. This applies to all faceplates but black one."
1,35mm slides??,"I bought this scanner for one reason. I wanted to scan 35mm slides. The product info says it will do this. However, all my slides are in jackets and the tma adapter for this scanner will not accept them. I can scan 35mm negatives just fine. If I want to scan my slides, I would have to remove them from the jackets which would be time consuming and pretty much ruin them. I also find the manual and help information for the scanner to be pretty much useless. If you are new to scanning then this is not the machine for you. My one star rating is because the scanner will not do what it advertised it would."
1,What did I do!,This thing eats resources like nothing I've ever seen. Any scan over 600 dpi takes forever (try an hour for 2400DPI). Output files are huge (600M) and even with 130M of free ram it often pops out error messages. Granted I use a PII 450 with 256M but never had these issues with my old 4200c. I wasted 3 days trying to get this useable without success. The best I did was a 1200dpi 5X7 and that took nearly an hour. Neither the latest driver nor Customer Service helped. Don't make my mistake.
5,A leadership development strategy for insiders,"Author Blythe McGarvie presents a thoughtful, intelligent analysis of the paradox of leadership success - the simultaneous needs to ""fit in"" and ""stand out"" She teaches the prospective executive how to build a strong platform of leadership, resting firmly on this seemingly contradictory foundation. McGarvie explains that to be accepted and allowed to thrive, you must learn how to integrate or ""fit in"" to your company's culture and structure. Then, you must also ""stand out"" by visibly exhibiting your strengths, intelligence and talents, so you can move up the ladder. Drawing on her extensive executive experience, she breaks the ""FISO Factor"" down into six basic elements including fiscal savvy, honor, perceptiveness, networking, thirst for knowledge and worldwide citizenship. We recommend this well-reasoned, thought-provoking leadership development program to anyone who is searching for the keys to unlock the executive suite."
1,...,"What the heck are you thinking buying this thing. I thought it would be awesome, I was so excited when i ordered it. But once it came in through my mailbox, I was extremely dissapointed. Do not buy this... toy, no matter how good it looks"
5,A set of Cool Jazz!!!,"This lady is so underrated it's a shame!!!!!Love for the birds is a great set of Jazz! what's so refreshing about this cd is it's not another cd of covers!!!!!the music on this cd is rich, and it's so nice to hear new lyrics!!! Meredith's cool delivery is so smooth and relaxing!!and the picture on the cover is one of her many beautiful paintings!"
4,quality loss! lost star,I observed that on this year there was worsening in the quality in the organization of the material. Why? subject lack or time? Observation: nevertheless i didn'nt stop buying!
2,Flashy toy,"My cat loves the flashing lighted ball, mostly at night when the house is dark. Other than that, he's not especially attracted to this toy. I have NO IDEA what to do with the package of catnip(?) that came with the toy. I'm not even sure it's catnip, since it was unlabeled and there are no directions. But the label was so firmly and completely GLUED to the cheap cardboard scratching pad, that it can't be removed. Shreds of it continue to cling to the cardboard, and the cat eats them or leaves the chewed pieces all over the room. Overall, this is a minimally acceptable and not especially recommended toy."
4,"Hook, Line & Sinker!",I love this show and hope they will release it in the US soon. I got hooked on it fast and cant stop watching it.
2,"More Science, Less Edubabble","The best part of this book is Dr. Melvin Levine's introduction. I would like to have read more of the doctor's analysis of this condition. The author only had the benefit of a six day class with Dr. Levine. I think a solid two semesters of pediatric neuropsychology would be more appropriate for anyone working in this area or teaching in general!Although the author does a good job of describing the condition and has some excellent examples provided by afflicted children, she largely fails to provide a practical way out. She does little to discuss testing and how parents can deal with teachers and school systems. The bulk of the book is a blizzard of educationese about teaching writing. I am dealing with a 7th grader and her technics seems more appropriate to third graders.Fortunately, it is not an expensive book and I recommend it for that. You may find something useful here but I can't raise your hopes too high."
2,Paper Jambs,"I heavily use the HP 450CBi daily. Usually print 75 to 100 pages of Docs per day. Battery life is good. Print quality is good. Print speed is acceptable for a portable. Durability is questionable. I keep it clean and in its own protective case. I am on my THIRD HP450CBi printer in 9 months! Paper jambs, multiple sheets feeding, print carriage movement obstructed. I have tried many different types of paper based on quality, brand, thickness of paper, inkjet, multipurpose, etc. all with similar results. When number 3 gives out I think I go for a cheap disposable desk type model and plug into a 12V/110V power inverter in my vehicle. No Bluetooth as advertised. Forget IR. Just plug in a USB cable. Good Luck!"
1,Not worth the money.,"Both poorly written and edited. Pictures are poor quality. Too much basic science and not enough clinical application. Overall, good for Ph.Ds, not physicians. Far superior books available for radiologists and radiologists in training at cheaper price."
2,Save your money!,"The vehicle mode is cool, but the robot mode is slag (term used from the original transformers series - means ""junk""). Not very durable at all. My advice would be to skip this one. There are plenty of new Armada toys for 2003. All of which are cool."
3,"Not a star, but solid supporting character","The title doesn't refer to the comic or cartoon character, but the toy itself. His transform is simple yet clever enough to be fun and respectable. He won't take to long to become a warrior on the battle field (not like that complicated incompetant RID Side-burn). Short and chunky, he's got personality, like the fat kid in ""Goonies"". He won't be the star of the toy box, but he'll always be there to back up the cooler guys, like Prime or Blurr."
5,John Wayne/There Rode A Legend,It is now my favorite book on the life of John Wayne. Lots of photos I had not previously seen. Great coverage of his entire life with details of his ranch and cattle. A must have for any John Wayne fan.
4,Works good,This product works well. Takes a few applications for it to fully cover. Depends on how washed out the plastic is before application.
4,Works on plastics,"I bought this intending to use it on my car, but never did. I did use it on a faded plastic bottom trim piece on my big refrigerator, and it worked really well. The cloudy hazed spots are gone, and it looks plain black now."
3,Difficult to get it right,"I found the application to be tedious. It goes on streaky and dries that way too, even if you keep the applicator soaked. needed a minimum of three coast to look fairly even. A sealer / protectant on top of it makes a big difference on the shine and appearance. After it dries I thought that the trim looks as if it was painted, not the natural finish you'd expect. I only did the areas that desperately need it to be re-dyed. If your surface can use one of those temporary coatings that last a few months, that's the way I would go, then you know you can recoat it or use something else when you need to do it again. I taped the painted areas next to the trim to avoid over runs, it was a good idea but not really necessary, the dye wipes off clean when it is still wet and, with a little extra work, after it dries. it is absolutely necessary to clean the surface BEFORE you apply the dye and the stuff that comes with it works just fine. Feb 2013"
2,Didn't help much,"The product, for me, did not really work as well as hoped. I had some black areas on my 2007 Honda Fit that had turned gray and the application did not turn it back to black although it moved it a few shades darker gray. I was hoping for something a bit better."
4,Great Product-but I didn't know what it was...,"I was a little dismayed when this arrived - I had somehow completely misunderstood what it was - I thought it was a book about the Civil War and it was a comic book about another ""civil war"" altogether. I had to laugh at myself because of my error but the good thing was, my husband collects Marvel comic books and was elated to see it under the tree.On the positive side for those of you who read descriptives a little more carefully than I do - it was in lovely condition, shipped pronto and was very reasonable! A good experience all round!"
3,Interesting,"This book is an interesting read. I, too, am from Louisiana but unlike the author, I don't know my complete family history because there were too many secrets that people kept with them to the grave so I am happy to read about other people's family that is probably very similar to mine...unfortunately, I will never know ALL the details about my own."
2,How painstakingly depressing!,Initially was so exicted to buy this. first let me say i respect anyone's right to tell their story. But I also say some stories dont need to be put on paper. this book had me begging for it to end! first there were FAR TOO MANY characters floating through this book. I had a very hard time keeping up with who was who!'Then there were far too many errors in the book that should have been caught by the editor! Finally the authors obsession with writing about the horrid perverted acts annoyingly often and very distubing. I completely skipped those portions and there were lots! Overall i didnt enjoy the book at all and found it depressingly annoying and was glad when it was over.
5,This history is a necessary read,"I just read a ""one star review"" of this book, and it galled me. So I write this.This book is a STANDARD history of Russia, used by many, including my, college courses on the subject. It is generally considered a classic.If you want, or profess, to understand Russian history, this book is a must. Absolutely. First rate. NO, not without the author's personal imput.But what book is without that imput? NONE.Buy it, read it, and try to understand. Yes, read others, but read this first.THIS IS THE STANDARD TEXT.Take care and God bless your endeavors."
4,garden tool,This garden tool works really well and is a very good quality product for the price. I'm very satisfied with the item and also the quick delivery
5,A wonderfully evocative book.,"More than a cookbook, this is an evocative introduction to life on the Italian Riviera. The excellent, clear recipes sent us right to the kitchen -- and the picture Plotkin paints of Liguria sent us right to our travel agent: we've just come back from a vacation in the region, and this book proved an excellent guide."
1,Stopped after one week,The printer worked for one week. Then stopped working. I had given it as a gift. When I contacted HP I was told it could not. be repaired.
1,did not work,"It appeared to install fine, but for some reason the pages would come out blank when it printed. The seller told me it was the driver, but the HP website indicated Windows came with a driver pre-installed with Windows Vista and no option to download new driver. It was a big pain!!"
5,The best view ever of Dalgliesh's character.,"This is my absolute favorite of the Dalgliesh novels. The balance between exploring characters and expounding plot is just about perfect. The reader really feels for Dalgliesh as he struggles to decide about marrying Deborah Riscoe, and the murder than intrudes on his vacation is both horrible and intruiging. Finally, as an added bonus, in this book we at last get to read a bit of Dalgliesh's poetry: ten beautifully intricate lines addressed to Deborah. If you like and are interested in the character of Dalgliesh, you must own this book, because you will want to read it again and again."
3,DEUS EX MACHINA ENDING,"LOVED THE BOOK (AND ADAM DALGLIESH) UNTIL THE END. CONTRIVED AND TOTALLY UNSATISFYING RESOLUTION. OBVIOUSLY AN EARLY EFFORT, NOT UP TO JAMES' SUBSEQUENT NOVELS."
3,Savvy Shopper,"I bought this DVD based on the positive comments it received. However, I'll have to admit I was less than enthusiastic when I tried it. As someone who was trained and certified to teach step aerobics years ago, I know that adequate cuing and the ability to break down the moves for someone to follow along is an extremely important aspect of any class instruction. Unlike Gin Miller (the originator of Step) who performs this task extremely well, I was shocked and appalled to find the instructor on this DVD seriously lacked the ability to appropriately cue and break down the moves. Although the moves were not that difficult it would have been better if the instructor had taken the time to show the steps in slow motion and then add the step back into the chorography in real time. The DVD will get your heart rate up if you are able to follow the steps. So, with that said, I don't think this instructor is for me so I'll be sticking with Gin Miller."
3,Good reference but shouldn't be your only one,"If you have a colicky baby, then this book is written for you. For those of us who do not have colicky babies and still have sleep issues, this book should not be your only point of reference. My baby isn't the slightest bit colicky yet many of the sleep problems described in the book, Dr Weissbluth contributes to a ""post-colic"" baby. My daughter is cheery and almost never cries, but she suffers from short naps, night wakings and early rising. All of these things are described as post-colic baby issues. It becomes frustrating that he doesn't deal with non-colicky babies and their sleep disorders. Overall, the methods can be used for all babies colicky or not. I just wonder if they are the correct methods for a child that has never been colicky."
5,Must read!,"This is a must read. Marc Weissbluth is one of the foremost authorities on this matter and his insight was tremendously helpful to me as a first time mom. Often times when my little girl had been up for 2 hours and she started to cry I immediately thought she needed to be fed, when in fact she needed to take a nap. It's amazing what a good sleeper she is now. Ever since I read the book she has gotten just the right amount of sleep that she needs so that she is always cheerful in her wakeful periods. Highly recommended!"
5,FACT OR FICTION,"Having just completed The Templar Legacy I wanted to thank Steve Berry for writing a book that kept the mind constantly engaged in conjuring the characters next moves and creating situations that are stimulating as well as entertaining and plausible. The Templar Legacy held me spell bound. As soon as I thought I had it figured out, the author threw me off the track with new elements of surprise.. Mr. Berry has incorporated historical places and events so tactfully that the reader forgets which is fact and which is fiction and ends with the reader believing The Templar Legacy actually existed."
2,Steve Berry's novels,"Although I have enjoyed Mr,Berry's books they are beginning to sound like ""same book , second verse"" The plots seem the same with just different places. I likely will not purchase the next one. Hopefully he will find a new and fresh genre."
4,Another excellent story from Berry,"I have always been interested in Rennes Le Chateau and was thrilled to find this novel. It is the first in the Cotton Malone series and definitely worth the read. If you like series books, adventure, mystery and conspiracies, you should enjoy this one."
3,Wait for The Paperback,"I have read previous novels by Steve Berry, and I will admit this is not his best. The story is interesting, the characters are okay but you never really ""get"" them. I have no complaints about the ""book"" Berry created with this novel. I thought the storyline was prety good, it just was not up to par with what I think Berry is capable of. My suggestion is to wait until it hits paperback to spend your money - or visit a library. If you have never read Steve Berry, I would recommend you buy his previous novels first - otherwise you might miss some good books because of a mediocre ""Templar Legacy""."
2,Not one of his best!,I did not care for this one! Not one of his best books. The ending was a huge disappointment!
3,Not the Da Vinci Code,"It seems these days that any book about the Templars immediately gets branded as another Da Vinci Code by psudo marketing geniuses at the publishers and by those reviewing it. This one suffered the same fate. I found it very refreshing.While it was slow to reward my patience, the last hundred pages or so made the read worth it. The Malone character is fun to follow as he gets drawn into the plot himself.A new book out by Dave Brody will likely also be lumped by some into the Da Vinci Code camp, but it's anything but. ""Cabal of The Westford Knight: Templars at the Newport Tower"" is packed on every page with facts about the Templars but expertly ropes in many overlooked clues on this side of the Atlantic."
2,Disappointing,"This novel was no where near as interesting and involving as Berry's Third Secret. I recommend that book highly. The Templar Legacy dragged and seemed predictable. I found the theology weak and the characters rather one dimensional. Much of it was a simple rehash of speculation and unsupported ""facts"" that's grown tiresome in the wake of The Da Vinci Code hoopla. Interesting at times, certainly. Worth my time? No."
1,A total waste of time and money,"Forget about the derivative plot, and the one-dimensional characters. This author should be arrested for aggravated assault on the English language.Please, Mr. Berry: invest in good dictionary and USE it!"
1,Overpaid,I downloaded this book to my Kindle. Amazon charged $0.00 for this book. I think I overpaid.
2,stay away from this book,"I too was very dissappointed by this book. The story is ridiculous, characters are mostly one-dimensional and the few that are given a deeper background are completely unbelievable. The early conversations between Cotton and his former boss are terrible. The whole guilt-theme related to her (also completely unbelievable) relationship with former husband is repeated over and over - it's the start of every new location/conversation, and gets lethally boring.I still finished the book but knew for sure it was a waste of time once I got about halfway, Avignon and the character in the asylum... sigh. I only gave it a second star because of the topic - gotta love the Templar theme - even though its badly abused in this book which depicts the Templars as quite a deranged bunch of hoodlums. Stay away from this book."
3,Weak endings,"Having now read three titles by Steve Berry (Third Secret, Romanov Prophesy, and Templar Legacy), I must say that the author has an ability to spin a convincing tale but then loses it. The endings of especially Third Secret and the Templar Legacy are flawed by their unplausiblity. The realism of the story line keeps one interested but the ending spoils."
2,Too long and boring,"I know that this is just another book in trying to write an alternate Christian history, popular right now because of the success of the Da Vinci Code. The fact that it is meant to be offensive to people of religion is one annoying aspect of the book. But no one warned me about how boring the book is or that the book goes on and on and never seems to end. I did not make it all the way to the end. I am glad I borrowed a copy and did not buy it. Not recommended."
2,Falsely Accuses Bible of being Contradictory,"This is a story line attacking the merits of the resurrection of Jesus as is popular in modern culture. This work of fiction capitalizes on the swell of popular culture to attack the resurrection of Christ. One of the books tactics regards Bible inerrancy and addresses the supposed contradictions in the resurrection narratives (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John in the Bible). This is a favorite study of mine and I assure you the accusations are false.Other than that, the book is an okay read, kinda entertaining in places. Not too convincing."
5,Juice Fasting and Detoxification,"this book is well organizied and well written. as someone who has been detoxing for over 15 years, i highly recommend this book for the first time ""faster"". it can almost be renamed: the beginner's guide to fasting.it however has plenty of depth, an experienced detoxer can glean much from this book."
2,Not that informative!,"He wrote more about fasting in general than juice fasting, there was one short chapeter about juicing...and then said juicing wasnt even fasting.It just seemed like this book was thrown together."
2,Not what I was looking for,"This is a great book on fasting, I was really looking for detail on juicing in particular and this missed the mark for me. Juice fasting is definitely mentioned, but did not appear to be the primary focus of the book. Depends on what you are looking for, I would not have gotten this if I had a better understanding of the content."
2,Good juicing info but kooky religious stuff in it,"I'm returning this book - it has good juicing information in it, but it appears to have some kooky cult stuff too. Beginning of book is an unreferenced quote from Jesus, Essense Gospel of Peace - not from the bible. Then a chart of a yoga like guy with ""nice sounding"" but potentially dangerous prayers circling him - as a Christian, I don't want to invite angels into my body parts, that doesn't line up with God's word. Maybe I'm ""throwing the baby out with the bath water"" but I don't want it in my house."
3,counjuicer,This book was more complicated than I wanted. I did not want to spend the time needed to read the material.
1,Juice fasting,Not what I was looking for. I wanted more recipes rather than the philosophy for the juicing itself. Good luck.
2,Weak support,"A good idea, but the feel is awkward with the arms crossed under the headrest. In addition, the support feels weak. Ideally, armrests would be placed on either side of the headrest."
2,Stockman's analysis is faulty,"Stockman as a lot of credibility among liberals because he supposedly proves that Reagan increased the national debt. He does no such thing. What you read about is a Congress that refuses to ""rubbers stamp"" spending reductions. My problem with this book is the main premises are erroneous, namely that so-called Rosy Scenario was what everything depended on, that the Laffer Curve was discredited, and others. book basically covers 1981 and 1982, with the main focus on the former. The writing style isn't too bad for a bureaucrat. The last chapter is absurd, though. What he does is lashes out with personal attacks and childish name-calling. This is worth reading if you're studying the budget battles of the early eighties; it should be used as a companion to Craig Roberts' ""The Supply-Side Revolution"" (1984).Note: the above reviewer claims Stockman was OMB director from 1980 to 1986. Actually, he was there from 1981 to 1985."
2,Great pictures. Prices are not realistic.,"Of course there is enormous value to seeing a large number of antique pieces in a price guidebook. That said, this book does not provide much information to the collector to discern reproductions, newer yellow ware from vintage pieces. The book is certainly a must for the yellow ware collector due to the many pictures of vintage pieces but it provides little true collector information such as how cracks and chips affect the value, ratings of the most desired and collectible pieces, best auctions and shows to find yellow ware and general marketplace information."
2,I hate it,This vaccum is awful. I hate the way it falls over when you are trying to use the attachments. I hate emptying the canister! The filter in the canister won't let go of the dust it gets caught in the grooves. I always have to empty it outside. I live in Pittsburgh I don't want to go outside in the winter to empty my vaccum canister. The hangers for the cord broke off and I have to duct tape the filter to the side. It just didn't last very long. I'm almost afraid to buy another bagless upright again because of how unhappy I am with this one.
2,"Great design, no funcionality","I tried to abandon my PC for the iMac. The iMac looks great, has great speakers, great monitor, and that's about it. It is not very PC compatible at all, from peripherals to software. Running virtual PC is painfully slow and it's difficult to work with. The tech support is limited to 90 days and they remind you every time you call that you will be charged ... per call unless you sign up for an overpriced service plan. If the product is good, there should be service for at least a year without any charge. The environment is not intuitive at all either. Overall, the computer is slow and software is still limited, particularly for statistical and analytical software. Essentially, it's an overpriced stereo. Apple does provide a useful monitor post that simulates a neck for those times when the user needs to express frustration, which is often."
3,2001 Kia spectra wiring harness,It came in time. Its just really a basic product and it was fine i put it in a installed with in seconds...
2,Does not have enough of the translation words that I need.,I would not recommend this if you are looking for more word translations.It should have more word translations and less geography information.
1,Introduction to sicilian grammar,excelant book for someone that wants to learn the Sicilian grammar.
3,Quite Boring,"I had to read this play for a class and it was an extremely boring read. The only positive thing about Amigo's Blue Guitar is that it is very short. If you are forced to read it, it won't take too long."
1,Highly Disappointing,No power. Doesn't pick up cat litter. Can only use it for 5 minutes at a stretch. I'm really regretting purchasing this.
2,"Not much ""suck""","I have a Black and Decker Versapak dustbuster that eats this one for lunch. I like the ""floor stand recharger"" so I bought it for the upstairs. But when I compared it to the BD, the Dust Devel went back to the store."
1,"Expensive, Gutless, Short-Lived, Irreparable","It only had any real vacuum power when quite new.I can't get filters here in Canada, and I also read the (poor) NiCad battery is not replaceable.This one's only a few years old, cost too much money for its performance and short useful life.Yet the hardware and motor are all in fine shape as I toss out this nice looking red machine. Pity.What a stupid waste. It's a landfill-generating design. Based on this experience (read: getting screwed by the Corporate Greed Machine) I will never again touch this company's products."
2,SO SO,This book wasn't what I thought it was...but for what it is worth I looked through it and now feel like I should drop it off in a church youth box...
2,Not very entertaining.,"I was out one day shopping for age appropriate toys for my 8 month old and saw this. I bought it since it has the peek a blocks that my son enjoys from his other toys.The only thing about this toy that my son likes is the blocks. The fish itself doesn't hold his attention. He stops and listens to the music, but other than that he is not interested. It comes with 4 blocks but only 3 really fits inside the fish. The fact that you have to press on the fish to make the mouth open and release the blocks is a little too advanced for an 8 month old, let along for 6 months, which is the age this toy is rated for.My son is now 10 months and still ignores the fish.If you want a toy that will hold your child's attention, I would pass by this one and keep looking."
2,Disappointed,"I'm very disappointed with this product. I bought it when my daughter was 6 months old because it is recommended for 6+ months. However, she didn't start playing with it until 10 months. She likes putting the blocks inside the fish but gets mad when the 4th block doesn't fit. She also gets mad when she can't get the blocks out because she doesn't understand how to empty the fish by pushing down on his tail. Its overall fish design is what attracted me to the product however I am so disappointed with it."
2,Not for administrators,"I've found this book extremely frustrating. It talks about a lot of things that I'd like to do, but does not tell you how to do them! I give two stars because it's discussions are still informative and provide some insight into portal design and sharepoint's capabilities.But, what I really needed were practical implementation details, and this book completely fails to deliver in that respect."
1,awkward fit,"I bought this for our 3.5 year old as she is growing out of her toddler seat. I thought with the Eddie Bauer name and the good review of safety by a well known magazine that reviews safety that this would be a great seat. It is not. It doesn't sit in my ford explorer in a way that is comfortable for my kid to sit in the seat. She is sitting leaning back at a weird angle, no matter how i adjust the car seat or the car or the latch. i do think the harness adjustment is hard to use, at least compared to the gracos we had. (had for both baby seat and toddler seat). The cup holders are out of reach for her in a normal seated position --- or as normal as you can get in this thing. My husband and i each need a car seat, so i'll put this one in his car (much less use of it) and i am buying a britax and putting that in my vehicle. i would NOT recommend this seat."
4,My 3 year old loves it!,"We thought the assembling the castle would be a pain. However, my husband barely used a foul word during the process. Let's face it... this a plastic tohy not meant for years of use. However it will perfect for the year or so that my daughter is fascinated with Disney Princesses. The pieces fit together easily. I don't think we were quite prepared for how big the castle is- 30 inches or so.(I didn't read the specs) The only two negative things I have are 1) the elevator elevates automatically. Then you have to push it back down to the base. I'm not sure how long it will work with the heavy hands of a pre-schooler pushing it down.2) when placed on the floor my daughter can't play with her dolls on the first floor of the castle and you can't push the second floor up. We ended up puting the castle on a pottery barn play table. It's around 18 inches off the ground. That allows my daughter space to play with dolls on both floors. For the disocunted price it is pretty darn cute."
1,might be a good toy but don't order through amazon mine came used and broke,The product that I ordered was supposed to be brand new but it came used and broke I don't trust Amazon from here on out. I don't know if this would be a good toy or not.
1,Not a very sturdy design,Not the best looking stand and if a strong wind rolls in it doesn't take much to see this thing in pieces...I'd invest in a nicer stand for a bit more $$$ for sure..
4,"Good book, but check the errata file","I just wanted to say that you should check -thoroughly- the errata info on the book (www.aw.com/devpress). I've lost a few days of work because the book failed to mention that named pipes cannot be created under windows 95. The book is, however, quite good."
2,So far doesn't work,"I needed and ordered four of these (actually I placed a duplicate order by mistake and got eight of them; see below). I programmed the dip switches to correspond exactly to my old decrepit butstill-functioning unit, and these new ones did not work. I double-checked settings. I put in my own fresh batteries. Nothing. So I am hoping one of the other residents or the manager of condominium complex will be able to get these to work. At this point they do not.Regarding the duplicate order: it was a mistake, pure and simple. I wanted to send the extras back, but seller said I'd have to pay shipping (OK) as well as a $5 restocking fee (not OK). So, if I can get them to work I'm just going to donate the extras to the condominium homeowners' association."
4,Remote Garage Door Transmitter -- Linear DTC Delta 3,The two garage door opener remote control units I received were in perfect shape and worked as soon as I tried them.DJM
4,Wonderful Arrangements and Great Storytelling,"Even if you're not a fan of musicals, you'll find this work to be highly entertaining. Narrated by Richard Burton (possibly the finest speaking voice ever), this already classic sci-fi story is condensed into short verses mixed with some great (if somewhat overly-theatrical) songs. You'll like this music if you're into '70s rock (like the Moody Blues, ELO, etc.)"
1,Broke the First Week,"This chair was painful to assemble. The tiny tools included cut my hands up pretty good before I went for the power drill and wrench set in the garage.Once assembled, they look great. Stylish and shiny. The chrome is really nice looking. They're mildly comfortable, not great, but not bad. Appropriate for an office guest chair, not appropriate for relaxing and watching TV after work.The swivel action is really nice. It glides really smoothly. Unfortunately, the swivel hardware sheared itself in half the first week I owned the chair. The chair literally fell right off the base, dumping me and my PowerBook onto the floor. I got a good bruise, and the PowerBook got a nice dent. We returned the chair right away. AVOID THIS CHAIR! Very shoddy hardware in the swivel unit. There are a couple other reviews for this chair (in brown) that had the same experience. Buyer beware!"
1,DO NOT BUY,"DANGEROUS product. Do not buy. Initial assembly required manufacturer to ship parts for both I purchased. After months of use, the swivel assemblies snapped. H2O no longer manufactures them, nor are there any replacement parts available. They no longer respond to my FAXs'. No Stars here, had to give one to review"
3,An average effort,"As most reviewers, I happen to own 1 and 2 - instant classics. Unfortuantely, vol 3 doesn't live up to that expectation. There are some standout tunes in here, but to be honest, the mix doesn't stand-up... If you want to continue with the deep house vibe, I'd recommend a certain Ian Pooley's NiteLife 06."
4,Another solid Naked Music Release,"This may not be as deep as vol.1 & 2, but you can't go wrong with a naked music realease that features Lisa Shaw, Miguel Migs and Blue Six. Overall very enjoyable."
3,House Music Lover,I purchased volume 3 yesterday (12/11) at a local music store in Baltimore. This CD is not bad at all. It's more on the club side than staying at home listening to it with your wife or girl friend. What I'm interested in is a more laid back vocals CD which I'm hoping to expect in volumes 1 and 2. I should receive those within a couple of days. Will let you know.
3,This is a warning!,"Nude Dimensions Vol.3 is alright. It's a nice compilation of contemporary house tunes once more compiled by Bruno Ybarra. BUT: If you're going to buy this one because you simply want Nude Dimensions Vol. 2 to be continued (Which has been my favorite for one year now!!!): DO NOT BUY VOL.3!!! You will certainly be disappointed. To me it seems, they don't have anything in common besides the label. I hope I can prevent some Vol 2 Lovers from beeing disappointed as I'm now."
5,Pleasantly surprised,"I have just spent a weekend listening to this on repeat at a friend's place and have only good things to say about it. I logged onto this now to order my very own copy and found a lot of backwards and forwards on the quality of this cd, how it compares to previous releases etc. So I felt compelled to add my bit.I have not heard volumes 1 and 2 so cannot comment on them. All I know is that I enjoyed this cd very much. Re the reviews: some interesting comments regarding slip covers, varying styles and failure / success rates on the mixing but at end of day doesn't it just come down to the way you felt at 'that' time when you heard it? Sometimes you don't have to understand why and why should you? And often enough even a complete dissection of the success or failure of an album will fail to dissuade you that YOU like or dislike it more or less, right? So I am adding my comments to the list of people that liked it."
1,Not for Beginners,"Having experience in applique, I would not recommend this book for beginners. The ""step-by-steps"" seem to presume the reader already has working knowledge of the entire procedure. Be advised that the designs are not patterns and only usable after extensive copying, enlarging and breaking down into applique components."
3,Black and white photos,"I love hunan food...and after reading the reviews decided to order one. I haven't had time to try the recipes yet but it would probably help if there are more photos and if the photos are in color instead of black and white. So for someone whose new to hunan food and cooking (like myself), I find this book a challenge."
4,Minimal and Elegant,"(...) this was just a complete and total departure from most modern fiction, with a first time author who appreciates the fine art of saying less, yet meaning so much more.Even if you haven't the faintest clue who Ovid is, or, like myself, have only caught glimpses of his work while in school, you'll enjoy this graceful story about a mystic alchemist and her obsession with the famous Roman writer's obsession with greatness. Xenia is a marvelous and strong character--a woman out of place with her own time who is transcendent in her wisdom. Her and Ovid's narrative is such a vivid tale of self-fulfilling prophecy that you find yourself wondering how much Alison drew from Ovid's real life persona.And, if nothing else, read this book for the grace of a good writer, whose elegance and sparity make this not only all the more intriguing of a plot, but a refreshing break from all of today's ""Sex and the City"" and ""Bridget Jones"" knockoffs."
5,Great Product,Ordered this phone to replace one I had. This one was used but works perfectly! It has all the features that the other one had so all I had to do was switch the phone out and relabel the buttons. Shipped fast! Packaged Perfectly!
5,LONG SHORT STORY -Colin Quinn's great comedy concert,This is a great comedy concert on the foibles of mankind ! What else could come from the team of Jerry Seinfeld and Colin Quinn.
4,Great product,"The 15"" flat panel iMac earns all of the raves for product design and included software (the ""i"" apps are excellent). For some reason, the iMac does not photograph particulary well. it is much better looking in person. It is heavier than you might think and the base is larger than it appears in many photos.The video card is not great (the new 17"" screen version of the product addresses this problem). Given the tight placement of the components in the base, a fan was probably unavoidable. While the iMac fan is relatively quiet, I do miss my fanless G3 iMac for one reason --quiet.It is also past time for a ""speed bump"" on the iMac."
3,iMac ... i wonder,"I was loaned an iMac by Apple to review for my website. And while I agree that this is a beautiful machine, well made and a great machine for the ""home user"" it is NOT as robust as I would have liked.To say that there are more applications for this than a Windows machine is NOT right, and these are NOT as robust for high end work.Granted the iMac is targeted to home users, and for iDVD, iMovie, Office, and email this will be fine. The chances of crashing it are slim. However OSX crashes more often that XP under intense graphical stimulation (3D applications, Photoshop, Flash etc).OSX is also slower than XP, esp playing back any CPU based animation.Having said all this ... I would still highly recommend any home user buying one of these ... but if your into anything more than Office and iMovie .. get a G4, Ti-Book or even the new G5 coming out soon."
2,Save your money,"This book might have been an interesting debunking of bad science, but Mr. Dewdney conducts his examination in the true spirit of the Inquisition: he is less interested in finding the truth than he is in watching the accused burn. The result is singularly unsatisfying, as the reader wades through pages of Mr. Dewdnet not debunking bad science, but simply deriding it and righteously thumbing his nose at it. The experience is rather like watching someone shoot fish in a barrel--except that he's armed only with a squirt gun. Readers looking for an intellectually careful exploration of the issues here will be disappointed"
4,Bumpin' But not like Vol.1,"If you liked Vol. 1 you won't be let down, but it doesn't have the same flow. I hope they keep this series going with a Vol. 3,4,5 and on and on..."
5,"Mature, Sophisticated House","House music is known largely for smart beats and rhythm, but how about melody and nuanced production? The folks behind the Nude Dimension series have released a well-above average CD that sets itself apart from the rest with laid back house that disproves the theory that the genre lacks soul. From the opening track, the grooves seduce you with great vocals and slammin' beats. Unlike other compilations which feature hyperactive trance, ""Nude Dimensions Vol. 2"" is the sort of disc you can play if you're looking for mellowed-out rhythms for either a Saturday afternoon or a Sunday morning while you're enjoying brunch in bed. ""Nude Dimensions volume 2"" is a no-brainer of a purchase for those who are in the market of a dance CD that won't sound ridiculous after 6 months."
4,"Good, but I preferred vol. 1","My view would differ with many, but I think vol. 1 was better. It was a more diverse album for me. This album has a harder beat and sounds more refined, though. In the end it's what you want, really; a smooth, diverse collection (vol. 1) or a harder, more consistent sound. Both albums are excellent."
4,Interesting story!,"I enjoyed this book...the story really showed how a snotty rich girl retaliates, to be as concise as possible. I do think the story was a bit longer than it needed to be. Also this version has REALLY small print, which is annoying (even for really healthy eyes). All in all, I would recommend it. It's like chick lit takes on socioeconomic status issues."
3,Bovary - beaucoup de bruit pour rien?,"I have now read this book twice in French, and although I am well aware of the mental and creative torment which Flaubert went through in order to produce the novel, I have never been able to see why it has succeeded in enrapturing successive generations so. Bovary is a very ordinary adulteress; Charles is an emotional halfwit. Madame Bovary may be accredited as the first modern French novel, but much of its acclaim stemmed from its ""daring"" carnality and associated court trial, which, as DH Lawrence once again proved seventy years on, is guaranteed to foster more renown than anything as boring as literary competence. Flaubert's own erotic exploits make much more interesting reading - cast an eye over Julian Barnes' ""Flaubert's Parrot."""
5,Wonderful!,"We removed the carpet from our stairs and purchased this set of attachments for our old, reliable Dirt Devil. The instructions are very good, and the attachments are easy to put on and take off. Can't wait to use it in the car!"
1,Multipurpose?,Tried to use this kit to install a stereo into a Jeep Cherokee.I couldn't find any combination of parts or pieces out of this mess to work.Ended up riveting the factory mount to the new stereo.
2,Could have been a great toy,"Reading the box I thought it would be a wonderful toy for my 8 month old. However, everytime he pulls on the net the entire top half comes apart. That's know fun because he cannot put it back together. It should have a locking mechanism so that it would not come apart."
2,Not bad,"Convenient as an airline carry-on, and you can wear it as a backpack or roll it. But it's not as spacious inside as it looks in the picture."
4,A worthy addition to your dance music collection,"Miguel Migs has put together a very good dance mix CD. It has the generally high quality that we have all come to expect from him and, of course, Naked Music. I have to stop just short of giving this a perfect 5-star rating because it's not as consistently excellent as Miguel's superior effort, Nude Tempo I. Although I listen to this CD often (almost every day), I often find myself skipping past certain tracks, especially track 5. Nonetheless, if you like dance music with a sophisticated feel to it, you can't go wrong with this CD."
5,Excellent Deep house!!,"If you are into the deep house thing you might want to check this CD out. If I had to choose a favorite track it would be # 9 ""Music and Wine"". I like both , and the track makes you want to enjoy both , and bust your own groove....I prefer to state that the whole CD is filled with decent to very good(more of these than the former) tracks and will not disappoint lovers of house music."
2,Not same quality as Dirt Devil brand,These belts are thinner and also have fewer layers of reinforcement within the rubber than actual Dirt Devil belts. The ad wording is a little deceptive by stating they are Genuine Dirt Devil style belts. Same style but not close to genuine Dirt Devil quality. I bought these from 'Vacuum Fix'
4,great looking,The lights work well..remember to turn the lights to the on position..nice copper color with glass and blue light..
2,**One came broken and four addition lights didn't work**,"The lights are presentable and are bright. Atleast for the lights that did light up. Depending on the weather will determine how long they last at night. One light already came broken. You can hear the inner parts rattling. Four other lights did not light up. It was probably all in due time, before they all wouldn't light up."
1,disappointed,"I loved the look of these when I received them and they worked well for weeks. Now they're not working at all. There's nothing wrong with the batteries. My delight turned into disappointment. I understand the point that they need lots of sunlight, but why did they work so well for a few weeks? I tried moving them so they'd get plenty of sun but they still don't work. I would have given this product zero stars if it was allowed."
4,Solar Light,"Great price, very pretty and quite easy to assemble, even for me! However, lights only stay lit for 2-3 hours after dark. That part was a bit disappointing.Judy Cupps"
1,blah,"(copy and pasted someones else review, because its exactly the same scenario for me)When I first started using these lights I was very happy. They are very nice looking, easy to assemble, and the lights that were in direct sunlight all day stayed lit for about 8 hours a night.Now, after using these lights for a little longer than a month, the lights in direct sunlight stay on barely 3 hours a night. I think all the positive reviews for this product must be from people that have been using their lights for a short time.Don't buy these lights, they aren't worth it at any price."
4,Great Item!!,"I have had my solar lights up and all working for a month.Friends and neighbors ask where I got them, they love the soft clear light they give off, and during the day they really stand out because of the copper finish.Well worth the price!"
3,"Came 90% assembled, poor packing!","Easy to assemble. First few days worked like a charm, remained lighted until the next morning. Shortly after 3 days, remains lighted at most for five hours! Whenever I touch the metal part, my hand feels itchy! Can it be due to Ni-Cd battery? Safety requires a protective coating! Difficult to find any well built solar lights for a price. Let's see how well it holds in the winter! Would recommend.Upendra Roy"
4,I like it,Its a little bit noisy but it crushes ice and makes smoothies like no other blender I have used. It looks great in the kitchen.
3,KitchenAid 5-Speed Blenders,"I like the motor, it is powerful. There is a plastic smell coming from the jar that I find unpleasant when the motor runs."
1,NO PULSE BLEND,"I would not buy this again.In ways it's fine, but it can make a sudden, huge messof your kitchen. It can blast the food, on startup, intothe top of the blender--and force it out all overyour counters. Now for cleanup. Of your clothes, countersthe top of the blender, and the undersides of youroverhead cabinets. Great fun.-=-=- Blenders are to save time, but if youlike to spend time mopping up the kitchen,go ahead the buy this.-=-=- Well...better tofind a unit with pulse blend. The onlyarrangement that makes sense.-=-=- Best luck!!!~ TPB"
1,Don't buy this blender for crushing ice or making smoothies,I bought the KitchenAid 5-speed blender in September to make fruit smoothies for my son when he came home from college. I've used it less than 30 times and it is now leaking all over my counters. It would have been cheaper to give my son money and pay for his gas to buy fruit smoothies at the mall. KitchenAid used to make great products. This blender is definitely not one of them.
1,Save your money,"I purchased this blender even after reading all the negative reviews on Amazon. I should have listened to what others had to say because within two months of use, the blade of the blender broke off while making a breakfast smoothie. KitchenAid offered to send a new one within a week or two, but I said no thanks. I can't afford not to have a functioning blender for a week -- I use it every morning to make my breakfast. I wanted my money back, and although KitchenAid said no, the Amazon employee complied and was very helpful. I bought a refurbished Vitamix (7 year warranty!) instead and have been happy with it ever since (~six months). I recommend passing on the KitchenAid and looking elsewhere."
2,This is not an alanis interveiw,"Dont not buy this product if you think you are going to get hours of Alanis talking and being asked questions. Thats not what it is. That is what i was exprecting but no i was wrong. This CD is just this British woman talking about Alanis' life and her career. It only has 15 second clips of Alanis talking at the beginning of each track. This CD is not what it may seem. The Mini poster is kind of cool though, but overall it is not worth it."
2,Replacement filter,"Just phoned Sharp USA support and was quoted $110 for HEPA replacement filter + shipping. Think twice before buying this product. I have used mine for 2 year, very lightly and HEPA filter is really dirty already. So be ready to shell out 120-130 bux every year for HEPA filters. If you have the money, it is a great product."
5,Herbasway is GREAT,"I had some samples of this great product ( Herbasway green tea ) and tried them out. I was so impressed that I started looking for it on Amazon. I take it with me in my purse so if we make a drink stop I only order hot water and then use my green tea. I have shared it with some friends and they also like it. I don't think I will ever go back to drinking regular green anymore. Great if you are on the HCG Diet, it also is great as a cold drink."
5,very fast and affordable :),"ddr2 with 4-4-4-12 and 800mhz with great heat spreader , what more do you WANT :)"
1,2x2 = 2 ???,"The description does not match the title. Description says this is two one GB sticks, not two two GB sticks."
1,purchase,Purchased a model car due to I love building models. I was expecting a fun build only to find it was a level 1 model. Seller did not mention this in the add or I would not have purchased this. I am not happy with my purchase.
3,Good BUT....,"Excellent bluegrass sound and style. But, I was disappointed with the overall album. I originally bought the album after watching a ""Love Song for Bobby Long"". Sadly, I think the only three songs I really liked on his album were the ones from the movie. In my opinion, if you are buying because of the movie, you should stick to the soundtrack."
5,Excellent,"I first heard Grayson Capps when I purchased the soundtrack to ""Love Song for Bobby Long"". I love the sort of blues/folk/rock sound of his songs. The quality of his voice is earthy and sexy. If I had to compare him to someone, I'd have to say he is like a male Lucinda Williams. I also like his songs that evoke the south..Louisiana in particular...brings back memories of my childhood. I would definitely recommend this CD!"
2,Um...OK?,"Basically, I never found this interesting, while I very much enjoyed other Carmen Sandiego games. The challenges were like nothing I'd learned in English classes, and villains popping up with the scary music pressured me (and not in a good way). There was no reason for me to play it more than once or twice. However, a family friend's son, Issac, found it entertaining when he was about twelve and played it non-stop while his family was over. I didn't see much of it, but I noticed a mad scientist-type villain that looked like a vampire. The scary music with him creeping up and then laughing manically could have given me nightmares. Only buy it if you have an American education and work well under pressure."
2,Inaccurate system requirements,"This sounds like a great program, but like many people I can't try it because the system requirements are WRONG in the description. The description says it's for Win95/98/Me/XP or Vista. The case says: Windows 98, Me; 66 MHz or faster processor; 16 MB RAM; 25 MB free hard disk space. For Mac it lists Mac OS 7.5.1-9.2; 100 MHz or faster processor; 16 MB RAM free; minimum 20 MB hard disk space.Never open the package until you have checked whether the system requirements web description matches the case, because unfortunately most of the time it does not in my experience."
4,A Humorous Slant on Major Dysfunction,"While I wasn't quite as enamored with this novel as some of the other reviewers I did enjoy it, and it certainly is a new twist on writing to tackle the subject of child molestation with humour! Poor Thelma has ... abusive parents, the kind of self-absorbed perverse people that you know are out there but wish were not. In order to cope with her nightmarish childhood, she develops a keen sense of humour and some imaginary friends that follow her into adulthood. Although she is successful academically and professionally, Thelma struggles with her sense of self and reality. She falls prey to mental illness and must learn to cope in the world she has created. The writing is crisp and witty, and the the novel is certainly a new slant on the ""dysfunctional family"" scenario."
4,Nice,Haven't heard this album in full in probably 20 years. Panic in Detroit is so simple a tune yet I love it.
3,A good book with a misleading title,"This book is a great resource for those interested in studying or practicing Watts Humphries' PSP (the Personal Software Process).If you are looking for a general-purpose text that explains how to bring discipline into the software engineering process, I would recommend moving along, and finding another book.However, if you're looking to understand the ins-and-outs of the PSP, or for guidance on how to actually try the PSP, there may be no better reference than this. In all likelihood, this book will help you comprehend the PSP even more than books that have ""Personal Software Process"" in the title.I'd give it 5-stars as a PSP text, and 1.5-stars as a generic software engineering text. Ergo, I settled on 3."
5,Good Story,Thrilling story about being cought out on the ocean in high winds without the proper training. I think the book was far too short for the price though.
3,Review,"The book Caught By The Sea by Gary Paulson is a pretty good book. The book is about when Gary Paulson, the author, gets into sail boating and the troubles that he has with the weather and the quality of his boats that he owns. I recommend this book to any one who likes sailboats and people who like stories about the sea. Also I recommend this book to people who like all of Gary Paulson's other books. Also this book kind of tells you what sailing is like and about."
4,Great Geo Trax item,"Geo Trax is a beautiful toy for any toddler. I must admit you'll need a very big room for your child to enjoy the different ""areas"" of the railroad system and are not easy to assemble by small children alone. Once they are assembled, the system is truly beautiful and kids will really enjoy them for hours!"
5,A genuine nugget in Amazon library,The problem presented in Darkness at Night had me thinking about it for many years. It is truly a great mystery in our universe and it is a mystical problem because the problem according to earthly science should not be. For me it will always be proof that we humans live in a very mystical universe.
1,Cheesy Hollywood style,"I was very disappointed w/this album. As a dancer, I found that authentic Tahitian music and drum beats are very hard to find, and this is one of the ""frogs"" I had to kiss in order to find better ones. Don't waste your money on this one."
4,japanese rocky reggae party,"Little Tempo are a Japanese reggae outfit. This album is the dub version of ""Musical Brain Food""- what a title! It's dubbed out by Naoyuki Uchida, the same engineer who has worked another cool Japanese reggae outfit Dry and Heavy. It's released on M Records- the label run by Twilight Circus which should give an indication of the sound for those familiar with his work. This is NOT nu-dub.This album rocks. It has all the drums and bass you'll need but you'll also find steel pans, killer flutes, steel guitars and the odd clarinet. ""One Bully Drive"" sees a version of the sleng teng rythem get a work over, while ""Splash Metal"" is a kind of Calypso-Afro beat dub hybrid. The album finishes with some kind of hawian island steel giutar thingy under the title of ""Love"".Fire Blender is a excellent fushion of dub and ""world"" sounds- King Tubby vs Sun Ra according to the sticker attached to the front of my copy. Great stuff."
2,Disappointed,I've just upgraded from a fully digital camera to the Nikon D200. The Kata H-10 looked like a great product. I went to Kata's site to research this bag. It said that it is good for a Digital SLR with a zoom len. It also said that it was compatible with the Nikon D200. I have a 18-135mm lens on my camera and it just barely fits in the bag. I have to kind of stuff it in to get it into the bag. It would have been better if it was a little roomier inside. Otherwise the bag is well constructed. I like the yellow lining because it makes it easy to see what is in the pockets.
4,better than the originals,"okay, to set the record straight, this album's covers are not really better than the originals; that was just a catchy heading. What they are is strange, funny, interesting, and maybe even sweet. The guy that came up with this idea is a genius. It's just too much. Great radio fodder! Great mixed tape/cd fodder!"
5,heartfelt genius,"I love this album! It is beautiful and brilliant. The cover of ""Desperado"" makes you want to weep. I listened to the whole album about 3 times the first day I got it."
5,Music as Rorschach test,"This CD blows me away. At times it takes me back to my days as an eight year old, sitting in my room with my friend Scott (now a professional guitarist), listening over and over to my one Beach Boy album on my lift-the-lid phono player. I can still sing along to every word of those songs. Other times (like when listening to this stunning, never-equaled version of Desperado) I am completely in the present, just awe struck by an incredible performance.Read the other reviews here. I feel as if I would like the folks who loved this album, that I'd want to hang out with them and get to know them (and go through their music collections). As far as the folks who hated it, who either had lost or even never had the ability to love this music, I just wouldn't have time for."
1,No good,"This book was written by someone who has limited knowledge of what counseling/therapy is actually about. It was extremely frustrating and ignorant in its views of the mental health field. Short answer: It sucks, don't bother."
5,Weber One Touch Gold,"Good old American quality. The fit and finish is perfect. It performs great. I purchased the seperate hanger for flipper, tongs, etc and it is perfect for this grill. I chose the blue grill and it looks like the high end grill that is a Weber. My next purchase will be the matching gas model."
5,One Touch is the best,I was very happy with the speed and ease of ordering and delivering. This was a gift for a friend she loved it....
1,Damaged,Agreed with all the reviews that give this product a 1 star. The box is too thin and not enough cushion. Wonder why Amazon not fixing this problem - don't they read the review and complaint?!!
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY and BUY LOCAL.,"Had I known how cheap and thin the metal is on this ""Weber"" grill I wouldn't have bothered even making the purchase.I inspected the shipping box and found no damage and yet the grill cover has a large 3"" deformity that I can only assume was made during production and missed completely by QA.Since this grill was on sale (Gee, I wonder why) and shipped with Prime I'll hope I can get 6 months to a year of grilling out of her. I don't think she'll comply.Save your money and buy local."
4,Perfect Gift for Dad,"My pops is a master griller and a huge fan of Weber (he's had one grill for at least 25 yrs). So, we decided to upgrade him to the 22.5 with the new ash cather and he absolutely loves it, not one complaint, he lovers love the color, but fears that in 25yrs it's going to look terrible."
4,Canon battery,"The battery works great I use it as a back-up and only have charged it twice,that's why I gave 4 stars instead of 5 ask me again in a year and I can attest to its durability.Worth the price so far."
1,Way too small,This will not hold a Nikon D40x with a small 18-55mm zoom. That is just to small to be useful.
3,Interesting but not Great,"In spite of the errors mentioned in another review the discussion was fairly interesting but not as great a ""debate"" as I anticipated. I'd spend my money on Penrose's ""The Emporer's New Mind"" before this one. For those interested in Black Holes, Kip Thorne's ""Black Holes and Time Warps ..."" is exceptionally well written and rewarding for the reader. For the technically [mathematically] apt who wants an fascinating treatice on spacetime, try John Wheeler and Ignazio Ciufolini's book on Geometrodynamics (Princeton Univ. Press)."
4,wonderful,"Perry Como is one of my favorites, this CD has some of his best songs, ""Magic Moments ""and"" Catch a falling star"", song I haven't heard for years, brings back great memories. Well worth it."
1,Voice is Nails on a Blackboard!!,"This poor woman had better never audition in front of Simon Cowell. Kids are very forgiving when in comes to listening to singing, but even they couldn't stand Ms. Miller's voice. There were times when her voice cracked, lots of times when she was off pitch, and lots and lots of times when we couldn't tell what she was saying. The word rhythms didn't flow comfortably. Stick with Ken Sheldon's teaching songs. You'll never hear complaints about him."
4,Entertaining Read,"I found this book a very entertaining read. The plot and atmosphere of the story fits well with the traditional Twilight Zone series. It moves along quickly, and quite a lot happens within this first book of the new series. I think most Twilight Zone and Sci-Fi fans will enjoy it."
5,Best combination of information and action,"Dr. Lam and Ms. Horstman have written a beautiful book that outlines the available treatments for arthritis as well as Dr. Lam's own program of Tai Chi. The graphics are beautiful, and lend an uplifting quality to the text. There is enough information to start an exercise program on your own and a list of teaching resources in the back. This book promises and delivers a better quality of life for men and women with arthritis. I have been following the program for over a year and have benefited greatly. This is one of the best applications of complementary medicine out there. It's a winner!"
5,Very nice music,"For a non-Indian, I was very impressed with this soundtrack. Great catchy tunes. Loved the movie and decided to buy the soundtrack. Before this movie, I used to make fun of Indian movies because I really found it hallarious that at various parts of the movie all the people would all of a sudden break into this elaborate dance (making most of the movies a kind of very elaborate, somewhat cheezy musicals). This movie was a great spoof about Indian films but it was also a great Indian movie itself with a typical Bollywood plot. Anyway, I loved it, so well done and funny."
4,BEAUTIFUL Pillows,"These are gorgeous yoga eye pillows! Barefoot Yoga shipped them right away. One note, the colors are slightly different than they appear in the photos online (equally gorgeous, just slightly different)."
1,Does not fit a 1985 ford mustang,"this item does not fit the connector in a 1985 for mustang lx,and it's not worth the time to try and get a refund for $4.00."
5,buy it woth the money,made the car instaltion very easy did a lot of reshearsh and it is totally worth buyin because you dont need to know much of anything to install with one
5,Discover Canada's unknown civil war history,"I was fascinated in discovering Canada's unknown history and connection with the American Civil War. My ancesters are from Canada and it opened my eyes to that country's involvement in our bloody civil war. I was surprised to discover that modern Canada took shape in 1867, 2 years following the end of the civil war."
3,Good History of the Evolution of Digital Filmmaking,"I thought this documentary would be a debate among the great filmmakers of our time on the merits of film vs. digital formats in feature filmmaking. I was hoping for a detailed and in depth analysis with strong arguments and insights on either side of the debate. And while the interviewed experts include many great filmmakers, and the pros and cons of each format are clearly laid out, this film is more of a survey than an in depth discussion. Perhaps I am just too familiar with this subject and my expectations were too high for new insights. I would recommend this to anyone who is unfamiliar with the history of film and the evolution of digital formats, as this serves as a terrific primer on the subject. But if you've been following this debate over the years, you probably won't find anything new here."
4,Good documentary.,"This was an informative and enjoyable documentary to watch. Not really 5 stars, but definitely 4. Coach David Alexander (.com)"
4,Very informative,"If you're at all interested in how movies are made. This movie, although sometimes dry is very informative. And it's pretty interesting to see how movie camera technology is changing the movie industry. Perhaps why the Paranormal Activity series has been so successful."
2,"not great, not terrible","ok jigger, great for a wet bar, hard to measure the 1oz mark, better to have a traditional jigger, but it makes it simpler if you don't want to have a whole drawer full of lush tools. 2 stars"
2,Meh...,"I've been trying everything to help get rid of the dog urine smell from my carpet. This seemed to get rid of the smell from some of the area, but not the whole thing. Plus it takes forever to dry, and now I have a new kind of mildew smell from it being wet for so long. Still shopping for the cureall product..."
4,great movie!,"I saw this movie on tv late one night. Its dramatic, thrilling and full of suspense. I definitley reccomend this movie!"
3,Beautiful BGM,"Nice to have as background music while you're doing your cooking or having a cup of tea. Go to another room for half an hour and then return, and you'll find it still sounding exactly the same. Well at least it's more 'happening' than some of the more recent Hafler Trio stuff lol"
1,"Prada Knock-off, Doesn't even try to look genuine.",I ordered this bag only to receive it and find out it is a cheap knock-off. And it is not even a convincing knock-off! It looks cheap. I thought ordering it through amazon would be safe. Not so.
5,Good dinner bag,"I love this Prada bag, have 3 different colors of the same style and would buy more. It is the perfect size as a dinner bag yet carry enough! The best part is it is autentic Prada for a lot less."
4,A good an enlightening read,An easy to read story of the creation of the US Constitution that provides a better understanding of how and why it is the way it is.
2,video quality is not so good,"looks like a pretty old version, the sound volume is quite low, and it tells most common sense I already know, if it gives one or two example weekly training schedule it should be more practical to follow. It is acceptable but i would not recommend it."
2,I was disappointed!,"I usually like the stories she puts out, but this particular one really surprised me. I didn't even finish it. I felt like it was condemning the person over and over for not being perfect or doing the right thing. I only read the first 2 or 3 chapters, so it may have gotten better as it went along. Don't get me wrong, I think a person should do right and the best they can, but if we were all perfect, we wouldn't need Jesus. I depend on Him and His forgiveness a lot because I am not perfect either!"
1,Not Pittie Approved,"I bought some of these because my pitbulls go through normal tennis balls in 30 seconds or less. The packaging made me believe these might last longer. I was mislead! My pitbull had half of the ball into cereal size bits within seconds. If you have a normal dog these might be ok, but I didn't notice these being any tougher for my dog to destroy than a normal tennis ball."
5,Just what i needed,Upgrades from factory stereos to modern stereos NEED one of these. Makes the transition SOOOOOO much easier and faster than messing with all the wires in the dash. Great list of connections on the package. A must buy for newbies or even pros at stereos. Makes things easy.
3,"Just Flowers, No Leaves","These molds work as advertised and the molded butter pats I made came out very nice. Since they are made of silicone the molded butter was easy to pop out with no loss of detail and the molds cleaned up in the dishwasher (I used the top shelf) with no problem.However, they are supposed to be a two piece set consisting of one rose mold and one leaf mold. They are not. They are prepackaged as 2 rose molds, not a leaf in sight. Someone got the item description wrong. Bit of a bummer since I wanted to use the leaf molds for Thanksgiving dinner."
5,"the inexpensive, effective way to cloth diaper","we used these until our son was about 15 pounds with no issues. totally sturdy and ready to be used again for the next one. prefolds are a great, inexpensive way to get started, especially w/ wool soakers or bummis whisper wraps and snappis."
3,I'm taking mine back,"I went the value route with this...paying $40 at Gander Mountain. I should have done my homework before making this purchase, because I'm looking for a hammock that will be comfortable and durable for 5-7 years. This hammock serves its purpose, but me, my wife, and kids all find it to be uncomfortable and akward to get in and lay in. It has to be hung very high to compensate for the extreme sagging, even with a 55 pound kid. I'm taking it back today, saving up some money, and will purchase something like a Palweys Island that gets solid reviews."
1,"BADLY FILMED, UNIMAGINATIVE, SONGS ARE RUSHED, NO EFFORT","BADLY FILMED, UNIMAGINATIVE, SONGS ARE RUSHED, NO EFFORT TAKEN TO CREATE AN EFFECT. THIS IS A TERRIBLE VIDEO. IT LOOKS LIKE THIS CREATOR RUSHED TO GET INTO THE ""MOZART""-TYPE VIDEOS BY GRABBING A BUNCH OF KIDS, SOME ADULT AND HAVING THEM GO THROUGH THE MOST BORING PACES. KIDS LOOK LEFT AND RIGHT, IT'S AS THOUGH THEY ARE RECEIVING THERE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE JOB. THE SONGS ARE MOSTLY SUNG BY THE ADULT AND SHE RUSHES THROUGH THEM. ABSOLUTELY A WASTE OF MONEY."
3,Good sound but bad shape and system,it has good sound but it is big...and wmp sync is not good system...you can not use it like flash disk...music transfer is slow...I am not happy now!!Look for another product
4,iRiver H10 20GB,"I have had my H10 for several months now.When I first received it, it froze up when I tried to load music onto it. This was fixed by upgrading the firmware. Simple fix and its worked great ever since.It was a little tricky to figure out how to transfer my playlists from my computer to the player. I would like to see an option to create playlists on the fly just using the player itself.Sound quality is great, the screen is bright and colorful.My only real complaint is the lack of accessories. Even on the internet the accessories are few and far between. I often gaze longingly at the millions of different iPod cases, skins, etc. available at most large retailers.Anyway, great product, I definately recommend it."
4,Need a great MP3 player,I was in the market recently for a MP3 player and all I kept hearing was iPOD after doing some research come to find out that there were some competitors in the market. After reading Consumer Reports and Tech news...iRiver gave a muc BIGGER band for the buck. I purchased the 20GB iRiver MP3 player much cheaper than the iPOD 4GB player and had more features such as voice recorder and FM recorder someting I might not use but it's there just in case.
2,Not what I expected.,"The images of this item look good on the site, especially the color screen. But, when I received it, it felt like a really cheap plastic case. And the color screen has low resolution quality. I used it for about 2 days, took the time to download subscription music to it and then it just died. Good alternatives are the Dell DJ and of course the more expensive iPod, both of which I own and am extremely happy with."
1,is iriver still in business?,"Regretfully, I bought an H10 20GB some time ago. Within the first couple months it died so I call iriver and made arrangements to send it back. It took several weeks to get it back. The one that came back was dead out of the box. I spent about 3 days trying to reach iriver to send this one back. The guy I spoke to told me that this item was seeing a lot of defects and returns. That was about 1 month ago. They said they sent a replacement - it never got here? Now I cannot get any response from iriver. I like to go to stores to see products then go to AMZN for the prices - iriver's stuff is not anywhere to be found in any of the major chain stores... these guys are going out of the game...."
1,What power?,"Not much movement of the head and it takes more pressure than you might think,for it to work.It looks like a Braun,but doesn't work like one.The only thing going for it is the soft brush head,but the flexible neck makes it hard to use even with the power off.A manual toothbrush is easier to use. Coming from a Sonicare and OralB power brush junkie,it was a huge disappointment."
4,Will buy again!,"The shampoo bar smells great, but after you rinse your hair it doesn't leave a very strong scent in your hair, which I think is nice. The bar can be used as a shampoo, conditioner, and soap so it makes life a bit more simple! This is a great product if you regularly travel and carry-on all your luggage, since it is not a liquid. If you have dry hair, the shampoo bar would be great for you. I have slightly oily hair, so once a week I use a different shampoo to help cleanse more oil out of my hair. I've been very happy with this product and with other Burt's Bees products, and will purchase the Rosemary Mint Shampoo Bar again. One bar lasted approx. 1 month with my husband and I both using it for shampoo, conditioner, and soap."
2,NOT SO GOOD,"Well the picture is ok, but to get to your input you have to scoll through the inputs to select the one you want, not good in a multi input setup....found black levels are very bad, and colors are ok....it's been one month and wish I waited for more reviews before I purchased this unit but the price got me, don't let it get you.....I'm in need of repairs and no support to be found any where, by phone or email. Search and think before purchasing any of these products, thank you for your time,JM of the lowcountry"
4,Excellent. Has a Unix Bias,"The book is excellent detailing obscure aspects of internethacks. It lack views of other operating systems, but thiswork of Bellowin an Cheswick is Superb!!."
2,Hidden Agenda,"I was looking for a book that was full of tales about a summer spent in a great part of the world (similar to Peter Fromm's 1993 book Indian Creek Chronicles). Instead, I got a thinly written book with limited character development, yet full of political agenda."
5,Miles and Maddie will never marry--HA! HA! HA!,"Yes, Miles and Maddie both said they would never fall in love and marry. Then they met one another. He had met her in Australia at a social and went back to London. He kept thinking about her and had to go back to Australia to get her off his mind. Maddie wanted a baby desparately. She saw the perfect genes in Miles. He had looks, intelligence, etc, etc, whatever it took to make a perfect baby. She was going to have the baby and not tell him. Well this book does get interesting. There is, if you like it, about 3 chapters of straight sex. Even though that was there, the book was still very good."
1,"First of all, I think the titile is very ironic!!!",I honestly think you were just making fun of Haiti and its people..
3,Kind of weird,"I have this game on Gameboy and I suggest that you get the computer one, although I do not have it.You know something weird? Why do you get in big trouble just because you ruined Rose's chandelier? I mean, isn't Nancy's friendship with Rose more important than a chandelier?Charlie is strange but kind of cute. Louis is very suspicious and dumb anyway. Abby is a mental. Don't believe anything she says!! (why is Rose friends with Abby, anyway???)Here's a hint: when you get stuck in the attic because Nancy carelessly pulls the string out, find the crowbar in the toolbox up in the attic and pry the trapdoor open.ALSO: Abby can't really ""talk"" to ghosts. It's all some kind of tape-recorded light show. Don't fall for it!!!Well, hope you like this game, because I didn't really."
5,fun and frustarating,this is a fun game but it can be very hard i do not recomend this for eight year-olds.
4,Message in a Haunted Mansion= GREAT,"I am almost [...] and I love the ND games. I have only played four of them so far and this is probably my 2nd favorite. It is filled with ""hauntings"" and much more.The game was short and easy once you are on the right path. But if you had no idea of what to do, it became difficult. I found myself having to go to a hint website that tells you everything you need to know. But other than that, I enjoyed it a lot."
3,Message in a Haunted Mansion,"I love all of the Nancy Drew games, but the 1st 3 are not as good as 4 (my favorite is 4) and up. This one is # 3 and it was kind of slow moving just because there wasn't as much to do as there is in the later games. I did like it, though, and it's fun to have played all of the games."
4,West Bend Party perk coffee pot,A very servicable coffee pot--seems to work well. It was purchased for use in a Sunday School Class and so is used weekly there. My only complaint is one that is common for almost all new appliances--the cord is very short and would be OK for a counter with a plug on the counter back but is not long enough for our setting with a table and lower wall plug.The Amazon price was very good and the delivery time was excellent.
4,Coffee urn lw,used this coffee pot at work for coffee break area. used a lot and had no problems with pot. Still working when I retired.
4,Works Fine,"Mine works just fine - I have no complaints, and I recommend it. I do have two things to note, however.First, the capacity (12-30 cups) is based on the assumption that a cup is 5 ounces in size. That's really small - an official ""cup"" is 8 ounces, and most people use a 10 ounce coffee mug. So, you should probably think of it as more of an ""8-15 cup capacity"" machine.Second, the owner's manual recommends how much ground coffee to use in the pot - these recommendations gave me VERY strong coffee. It may take some experimenting to come up with the right recipe."
1,PIECE OF JUNK - DO NOT BUY,"I am so disappointed with this coffee maker. I was in the market for a large capacity maker and read all the reviews. I bought this one based on MANY positive reviews and it was a bonus that it was so cheap. In fact, I questioned its quality based on price and I was right. You get what you pay for.I brewed my first batch and knew it was junk. The coffee tasted of metal. But I figured maybe it was only the first use so I would try again. I meticulously followed the cleaning instructions and despite that, I got calcification / mineral deposits in the urn after one use. I don't throw ANYTHING away. I will begrudgingly throw this out.I rely heavily on amazon reviewers and have never written one...this waste of time and money has compelled me to save others from the mistake I made."
4,west blend pot a good value,I am very happy with this automatic coffee pot. It was very reasonable for what it does and the coffee is good - it is easy to clean. I am glad that I got it!
3,It's ok,"It's an ok product for what it was designed. However, the power cord is VERY short and needs an extension cord in some situations. The coffee holder inside is plastic which is not to my liking. Still thinking whether I should return it."
3,30 cup coffee,Makes good coffee but some design issues. It is hard to get a cup under spigot. Also the stem is not long enough so putting basket into place is very difficult - nothing to hang onto.
3,Cord is WAY too short!,I purchased this pot recently and was amazed that the cord that came with the pot was so short you cannot plug it in and move it the the front of the countertop. I didn't measure it but it cannot be over about 25 inches long.This is the first purchase from Anazon.com (of many) that I have been dissatisfied with.
2,Aluminum,"I was disappointed when I opened box and saw that the metal container of the coffee pot look very thin and flimsy. I read everywhere and could not see any statement of what the product was made of. I called the customer service number and was told it is made of aluminum. Had I known that, I would not have bought it. I will be returning this and looking for a stainless steel version if one is out there. Aluminum is a soft metal that will get into your food. Yuck!"
2,Not enough Jazz,This is one of those snooozer DVD sets ... not enough of the music and too much vague attention to the author's sense of what was going on in the world.
1,Shockingly Revisionist and Doctrinaire View of Jazz History,"Throughly dismisses all Jazz after 1960, including Fusion, Free Jazz, and everything thereafter. Marsalis actually calls Cecil Taylor's music ""self-indulgent bullsh**"" Apparently Taylor was not allowed to rebut this during the film. How was that allowed to air on the supposedly intellectual (but more likely agenda-driven) on PBS, I will never understand. If you think Swing is the only valid form of Jazz, you will love this series. If you think Coltrane is a God, you get five minutes' summary. So lets see here: 15 hours on Louis Armstrong and Duke, 5 minutes on Coletrane, and a total didmissal of everything after Duke's death. Reminds me of the Republisuck's ""Fair and Balanced"" nonsense. PBS, this is your wake-up call. Stop trying to rewrite history - Jazz ain't in a museum. Just ask the artists (most of whom are alive) whom Burns left out. Metheny, you out there?"
3,jazz history,This is a great series the first of 10 DVDs is good & the last They spent too much time in the middle of the series with Charlie Parker & other radicles & could have spent more effort in relating more on the Greats. the series was interesting but disapointing to me personally for the price paid who can complain.
3,Not Complete,"Very extensive compilation of the more popular jazz greats in history. Covers many different genres in jazz, although I was very disappointed that Burns just casually dimisses the electric and fusion aspects of this great music. In music, there are always new developments and music becomes progressive.It saddens me to see that great innovator like Miles Davis is afforded only 5 minutes on that particular style. I seems like Ken Burns is almost ashamed of the development of modern jazz (fusion) that he omits it from this collection. This is my only qualm about his work."
5,Useful and fun,The book is clear and interesting. Fun to flip through and easy to use as a reference. Good choice.
3,SM202,"I was an Eagle Scout as a boy, and now I'm the founding Scoutmaster of my sons' troop. As such, I was anxious to get a copy of this hard cover version. Baden-Powell's work is a classic and well worth the read. The problem with this edition is the Introduction by Elleke Boehmer. Without it, the book is a 5-star. Ms. Boehmer appears a non-believer. Reading her is like taking a pessimistic art critic along side while viewing an art gallery. Far more benefit (for all concerned) would occur without her input. For each positive she states about BP, she mentions a negative. She also spends just over two pages discussing homosexual tendencies (pp xxxii-xxxiii) within BP's works, something which is out of place in this work. I started to list several quotes, but I think one sums it up best of all from the back cover: ""She has never been a scout, but she did once shake hands with Lady Baden-Powell at a jubilee celebration in South Africa."" I guess that must make her an expert."
2,Get a new introduction!,"Great book, terrible intro. What were the publisher's thinking? Do they want to sell books and have this recommended or not? The Intro by Elleke Boehmer is so longwinded (39 pages) and so derogatory toward the Scouts and it's founder it's mind-boggling. She obviously has no respect for the organization, and the sparse accolades she dispenses are only a cover in my opinion so she can degrade and dissect the Scouts two-fold thereafter. I recommend `Boy Scouts Handbook: The first Edition, 1911' (the Dover publications version) until they reprint this book with a positive and uplifting intro; one that makes you want to read or buy the book in the first place. new update, the dover edition 'scouting for boys' is great. much better intro to a great book!"
2,not one of her best,I have enjoyed her thriller type books. This had a poor plot and story line. It was too much like a poor romance novel
1,Looked unnatural,It looked so artificial and false and no matter how it was moved around on the head it was awful. Basically it looked so ridiculous that it was never worn for the purpose purchased or any other time.
4,A good way to kill a rainy Saturday...,"was what I thought when I found this copy in a box of donated paperbacks on my first Iraq tour. I love old WWII airplanes, goofy adventures, and grew up around my grandfather and all his WWII buddies listening to wild tales. I'd drop papers for 30 days' leave and cast my lot in with a caper like this in a heartbeat if the old guys asked. Tons of fun, but with just enough cliches to keep it from getting that fifth star."
3,Broken peice,"One of the pieces was broken upon arrival, the pieces are made of fairly cheap plastic. I felt like this product was overpriced for what is was. Also the shipping on it was alot."
3,"It's OK, but they cheaped out a little","My Dad has one of these and I've never seen another like it. When I found this I snapped it up. Unfortunately, they seem to have tryed to cut corners since they made my Dad's (which is ~20 years old, but made by the same company). My Dad's ruler, however, has a metal extension rather than the cheap plastic one on this one. This one also just feels cheaper/flimsy compared to his.In short, while this is a very good product, it's not as good as the original. I'd give it 5 stars if they'd stuck with the original design."
3,3 stars,I have ordered many bottles of this product many times and it has always arrived well packaged. Fair product for a fair price
3,Not my favorite (dries leather after use),"Bought this do to the recommendation of someone at one of the local farm/vet stores. Its easy to use but is definitely not my favorite. I use leather soaps & conditioners often on my western boots because I wear them everyday, & I drag them through a lot. Unfortunately every time ive used this product, a few hours later, my boots have taken on a dry appearance & texture that im not happy with at all. The price is fair, but id only buy/use it again if I had to. I definitely prefer other leather conditioners & cleaners over this one!"
5,Good stuff,I got My talcum it is awesome just like the barber shop uses! Great after a haircut or shave very nice smell not too strong just clean smelling.
5,Worth The Wait,"This grill is well built and engineered. It was easy to assemble and operate. It's stainless steel burners produced uniform flames that gave excellent results. The first time I used it, my steaks were cooked to perfection. My initial success made it appear as if I had many years of experience using this grill....."
5,Spot on,An excellent discussion of systems engineering with many useful insights for the working professional. Procedures and techniques are useful now. Spot on what a working se needs.
1,is this ever going to ship?,"I ordered the 500th Vader back when it was first announced in May. The shipping date was supposed to be 7/25/05, but the figure still has not shipped (7/28/05). whats the deal? These figures are all over eBay, and ive seen them in stores in Huntsville, AL. Am I ever going to get my action figure?"
1,Very disappointing,"I was looking for a book to help my son who has recently been diagnosed with dysgraphia. I paid 39.99 + shipping and could not in good conscious share this book with my son. Eli's writing example starts with ""I hate my life"" - this is not the example I want to share with my son. A very negative and insensitive image is portrayed about the teacher in this book as well. In no way could we relate to the experiences that Eli had at his school. Then a magical gnome saves the day, imaginary friends are great but this was a bit creepy. I am keeping this book to share with my son's school about WHAT NOT to get for help in dysgraphia."
1,Design flaw...kept going off the track,"My 2 year old LOVED this toy but I returned it because it kept going off track in the same spot. The train would not complete the full circle 8 as described and was intended to do. I was tired of my son yelling ""it broke"" every time he tried to use it. Sad because he really enjoyed it the 3/4th's of the track that it did stayed on."
1,cheap pos,"This charger did not make it though a weekend. It is very cheaply made. The idea is good, to be able to keep a second battery fresh on a big project, but this charger was not up to the task."
4,Satisfied,"A lot of people seem to have had problems with this unit, but They must not have read all the directions and warnings. I did, and I am satisfied with this product and especially with the price."
1,junk!!!!,"just got my new charger today,worked for one hour,then melted! third one.will be my last one! moving up to dewalt!do not buy people,and as far as the caution goes for DO NOT TRY TO CHARGE A DEAD BATTERY! goes for brand new ones to.garbage!!!!!!!!!!"
1,You own batteries will kill it!,"Perfectly good batteries will render this charger useless. It's a fairly sad product, as it cannot even charge properly the product it was designed to charge! This is a stock unit that comes with the cordless drills. Do yourself a favor, get a Dewalt charger that fits these batteries, and throw this in the trash. The Dewalt charger will even help B&D batteries perform better."
1,Stock lousy charger that comes with the drill,"This is the stock charger that comes with Black and Decker 12V drills. I've had one melt. The second one just stopped working. Black and Decker customer service is utterly unresponsive after multiple attempts. There's some indication that the Dewalt version of this, for $10 more, actually functions and fits the same battery."
1,under-engineered,"This product is grossly under-engineered. If you make the slightest mistake the product will short out and become useless. This is what happened to me. I accidently put a bad battery in the charger and it shorted out and is now just a piece of junk. Oh wait, actually it was a piece of junk even before it shorted out.Frankly, I'm surprised that Black and Decker still supplies these as replacements. I am now out $25+ with nothing to show for it. I will think long and hard before I buy another B&D; product.If I could rate this product lower than 1 I would."
1,sucked,"worked once then crapped out!!! had to go to Black and Decker to by the $65 charger, thanks to the wonderfull lady at the counter. She gave me a waranty exchange, even with me getting this charger off line. Don't waste your money on this P.O.S."
4,Performs as expected,This charger performs just as the original. Unfortunately the original was a slow charge also.
1,Only worked for 1 day,I bought this to replace a battery charger that had stopped working. I plugged it in and the light came on. By the time I checked it the next day....the light was out and it had stopped working.
4,Charged Up,"Originally This item came with a whole set, so I was exceptionally pleased that you could buy it separately because that is the only piece I needed to replace. It worked right out of the box Thank goodness I missed using my drill had to use my husbands a few times while waiting on this, so I was anxious. Be careful Not to drop.They are more fragile than you think. I think That's what happened to break mine in the first place."
3,HAVE EXTRA BATTERIES,If you want this or any wormlight then you will need alot of extra batteries because everytime you turn the gbc (gameboy color) on with the wormlight hooked up to it the battteries will get lower & lower life. The wormlight takes up aabout 2/4 of the batteries everytime you use it. If I were you I would just save my money & buy a different type of light. Althugh these lights look cool they will take up alot of you battery energy.
3,Okay ... this game is okay.,"I purchased this game for a member of my family who's a huge James Bond fan. The first couple of times we played the game I was impressed with the amount of questions.But after playing the game a few times, I noticed that the portion of the game dedicated to video questions from the DVD is limited. They showed the same clips and though the questions are different from time to time, we went through the cycle and I saw the same questions and clips.I still am impressed with all of the non-video questions (which come from the trivia cards), but that limits the game in the sense that we'll be forced to play strictly with the cards if we want any type of challenge, as the video questions will simply be a case of who remebers the answer from the last time the question was asked.I would give this product a 3 out of 5."
4,Everything that can happen did happen...,"I read the Illuminatus! trilogy about ten years ago and then accidentally came across copies of the Schrodinger's Cat trilogy at a used bookstore.I started and can't put them down. I don't have a huge scientific background, but ther is a true theory called Schrodinger's Cat and anyone who thinks that these book are rubbish just must not know this. They perfectly embody the idea of of the cat.And Wilson's crazy blend of fact and fiction just encouraged me to get more information about the past and science and the universe and every other thing that I could think of.Read this book with an open mind. Or read this book and open your mind."
5,I bought it just for the cover...,"...but it turned out I loved the words inside just as much. Robert Anton Wilson tells one hell of a shaggy-dog story in this book and in the Illuminatus! Trilogy (not to mention the rest of the Illuminati-centric stories).If you like conspiracy theories, drug humor, the occasional naughty bits, and convoluted alternate-realities, you'll adore this book to pieces. I had to buy a second copy because my first copy was lent out and never came back."
3,James Joyce This Isn't!,"I really wanted to like this but I found this book self-indulgent and pretentious. In short, this book thinks it's too cool for school. In that vein I think that Mr. Gass was out sick the day they taught that if you can't give your characters some likeable or redemptive qualities then a book probably isn't going to succeed. Back to the drawing board!"
2,Couldn't finish it,"I skimmed the last half of the book, it started off adventerous enough, but quickly spiraled in to tediousness."
5,The one,Want to buy one Alison Krouse and Union Station album? This is itCovers all the ground that has to be covered. great set to introduce AK and US to friends who don't know their work.
5,Spectacular!,This album is the best of the best when it comes to bluegrass these days. Alison's vocal and instrumental talent is only magnified (if that is possible) by the current line up of Union Station. Jerry Douglas is THE BEST DOBRO PLAYER to ever walk the face of the earth. You have got to get this album!
5,"Bluegrass, Newgrass, Great stuff","This two CD live performance is excellent in every way. Perfectly recorded and performed, it includes many of the songs the band is best known for. As usual, Alison's voice is angelic. Jerry Douglas plays licks on the dobro that are impossible. Great vocals and harmonies from Dan and Ron. A solid rhythm section, both with and without drums.Thw two songs from Oh, Brother Where Art Thou?, Man of Constant Sorrow and Down to the River To Pray are terrific. Two old pop covers also - Baby, Now That I Found You and But You Know I Love You.Highly recommended."
2,No English subtitles,"The series is great but if you can't understand what is being said it isnt that great. Season 2,3,4 had English caption but season five only had spanish and french. I would like to see a verison with English Subtitles."
4,Very Satisifying Conclusion,"For any La Femme Fan (or operative), this is what you should have to complete your collection. It has what you crave (beauty, brains, strength, mystery). It also has answers! I gave it 4 stars because 2 of our favorites are not in all episodes (Madeline and Michael). The final episodes are missing some chemistry from earlier seasons. Without giving away the end, the series wraps everything up, but still leaves some open ends for fans to hope for a movie-of-the-week at some point!"
1,the music you nap during at the big clubs...,"This is practically a full disc worth of songs that give you an opportunity to go find a couch or corner at a big city club to take a disco nap. It's mostly tribal instrumentals with some vocals samples hear and there, usually given the electronic sound. Of interesting note, track 1 does a little of the ""alright"" call out made popular in a pet shop boys song, track 2 is someone resinging (electronically enhanced) the chorus to Depeche Mode's ""It's No Good,"" and track 9 is actually a full length female vocal track, the only thing that really comes close to ""peak hour"", of which this disc promises whole CD worth....Track times are:1. 3:232. 3:523. 6:474. 6:035. 5:346. 4:077. 5:348. 4:009. 9:2710. 3:5211. 2:4012. 4:45"
1,Do Not Buy,"This is a complete waste of money. After the first time I washed the pump, the rubber honeycomb cup that you put on your nipple would not reattach properly so in order to pump I had to have the hard plastic against my nipples. Both of my nipples were bruised. Please spend the extra money and get a Medella pump. There is a reason why hospitals use them, THEY WORK!"
1,Waste of money,"I did not anticipate doing much pumping, so a manual pump was fine for me. However, this one is junk. It gets the milk out (however slowly) but after two or three hand washings the massage gasket is compromised and painfully compresses your nipples. This is particularly bad when trying to ease the discomfort of engorgement when your milk first comes in. I love the bottles, but this pump is garbage."
4,JSam,"I agree with most of the reviews. Some stated their box upon delivery was in bad shape. They must have corrected that deficiency, mine came in pretty good shape. One gentleman indicated hearing a loud clacking sound when peddling that eventually went away. I too have noticed the loud clacking sound and is still awaiting the day it goes away. Someone stated the bike isn't geared for people under 5'4"". I agree shorter people are going to need some propping. Bike is sturdy. Instructions are clear. Overall a pretty good bike. Seat is semi-comfortable. I really like the computer monitor. It monitors distance, heart rate and even have programs. I took a star off due to loud clacking sound that I'm HOPING eventually will go away."
1,Customer Service really SUCKS with this company,"I just bought this through Amazon and then put it together pretty quickly. Packaging was lousy, as others have already mentioned, and 3 pieces were either missing or broken, so I had to call for them. First customer service rep was ok, but the next day I found the pedal crank making a sound, and called back, but the next rep claimed that I put the pedals on wrong and refused to exchange the main part containing the gears. I held up the phone to the machine so he could hear it, and he acknowledged hearing the noise, but said I would have to open up the unit and identify the broken or loose piece on my own. The unit came w/ that part already sealed, so I don't know how they can expect me to spend my time playing maintenance technician on their product. Although the product appears to be engineered well, any company that's not willing to correct their mistakes deserves a negative rating."
1,Broke on second day,"This chair is smaller than you would think. My 160 lb teenage son sat it in the second day it was up and the ropes broke. It wasn't just that the knots came undone, the ropes themselves actually snapped. It says it will hold up to 400 lbs. I wouldn't buy it."
2,"Disappointing, Rehash of the Same Old Info","Coming from Harvard, I was hoping for much more, but I found this book a disappointment.Here's a direct quote from the introduction to the book.""Thyroid diseases are easily diagnosed with a simple blood test and easily treated.""Just this statement alone was enough to tell me that this book is not dealing in the reality of thyroid disease. There are more than 20 million people with thyroid disease (not the 12 million the author quotes) and half of them are undiagnosed. If it's so easily diagnosed and treated, this would not be the case.If you want more than ""easy to diagnose, easy to treat"" -- and let's face it, patients deserve more than that -- you're better off with any of the books by the Shameses, Mary Shomon, Elaine Moore, or Ridha Arem."
2,Very basic information,"If you know nothing at all about thyroid problems, this book will give you a very basic understanding of what they are. But there is little in here that is new, cutting edge, in depth, or comprehensive. And the title is poorly chosen, as ""overcoming"" thyroid problems is definitely not the thrust of the book. Read it if you're looking for a starting point, otherwise skip it."
4,Chef Tools @ home,"This is a quality Potatoe masher of solid stainless steel construction. The potatoe masher will allow you to use maximum pressure to mix potatoes, yams, or whatever else you could mash."
2,Nice before night,"I can't believe that such a big watch doesn't have a simple light. Given the color of the watch you can't see anything in the darkness. So, never take it if your gonna delay out until it gets dark in the night."
2,kind of let down,"the first song i heard from this band was butter cup and loved it.so i went a bought the cd,and was ready to enjoy the rest of the tracks on the album.thats where the problem came in.the rest of the songs on the cd are very weak an uninspireing lisin,its very rare for me to only really injoy one song from a band im into. most of the lyrics this dude writes are very cheesey from my point of view lil wolverine was another good track that thankfully eascaped the cheesey writeing of christian stone.ijustfelt letdown because from hearing buttercup i thought this band was gonna sound like dinosaur jr.but they turned out to be more of a main stream radio band."
2,Amazon has mixed up the reviews,"All the reviews are for the 2001 reunion tour, but Live at the Rainbow is the 1979 concert in Denver. I saw this same tour in Detroit and loved it but really this is the last album I would get by Roxy music. I had them all - including the BBC Files. This is really not that great. Too much Manifesto, which is an album written for depressed drunks. The arrangements are dull and even Paul Thompson is lame. Buy this one last, or better yet, don't buy it at all."
2,Sucking in the Seventies (bootleg quality),"This review is for 'Live at Rainbow Music Hall' by Roxy Music.Beware - not all the reviews here are.Bottom line, concert recorded in '79 and sound quality & mix are not the best. Ferry mixed way up front, everything else 'cept drums mixed way back.Recommended for Roxy collectors and purists...........otherwise this is forgettable.Note to Amazon - sort out these reviews, please?? I bought this after reading all the 5-star reviews and they're for a different CD entirely."
3,Print Shop w logo creator,The best you can expect from Broderbund or is it Encore? Anyway don't buy this product because of the logo creator like I did. Save your $$ and buy the less expensive version of Print Shop which is just as good for most desktop publishing needs. The logo creator needs a LOT of upgrading. Not that user-friendly and the import feature is a pain to use and does not work most of the time.
1,Do not waste your money on this book!!!,This book simply lists the reactions from Jerry Marchs' book(which the authors reference constantly!) in a different order.
1,rating for ciara,"I was very disappointed with my product. I can only wear the strongest strength, which I ordered. However, I do not feel it is the strongest, like advertised because after maybe 15 minutes the smell is gone."
4,Still can't get over Rohit,"I envisioned something a little bit different when I read the movie preview, so when it didn't play out that way I was left reeling with the feeling. Don't miss understand me, it's a good movie. I've watched mine twice now, but I still can't get over Rohit. I just knew they would pull a rabbit out of their hat and that's how the movie would go. Yet, they went a little more logical way. The songs were good and my extra features disc was neat in that Hrithik Roshan and Amisha Patel commentated their remarks in English, only Hrithik's dad didn't so I have no idea really what he was saying."
3,missing a cd,"It would be a great CD set, however I got 2 of the same cd's!I was really looking forward to the song from Camelot, which is the whole reason I ordered the CD and that CD was missing. How wierd to receive a packaged CD with 2 copies of the same disk. That has never happened and I never expected it to happen as I threw the receipt away so Amazon can you help me with this?"
5,Versapak Gold,"This is a much better battery than the usual silver one, and, consequently, the charge lasts a lot longer. The seller shipped it out promptly, and the price was reasonable."
4,Black & Decker - VersaPak Gold Battery!,"Black & Decker - VersaPak Gold Battery! I like using B&D VersaPak Tools for light duty hobby activities in my laboratory. The interchangeability is a handy feature. I have used many batteries including B&D VersaPak Gold and Silver. The GOLD Batteries due last longer than the Silvers. In my opinion, 60% is stretching it. Depending on cycles to include complete discharge, amount of use and other factors, 40-50% would be more accurate. The GOLD Batteries are not as impacted by the ""memory"" fade that the silvers are. For the same price or up to a couple dollars more per battery, the GOLD Batteries are a better buy."
4,"If you need Versapak batteries, you should get the Gold ones","I am in love with Versapak and have several appliances and tools that use these batteries. There is just one problem: the regular ones don't have much capacity and have a VERY short life. The Gold ones are much better but a little more expensive. In my opinion, they are well worth the extra price. It's really too bad that Black and Decker overprices the batteries os much."
5,Rejuvenate your dustbuster,We were getting ready to toss the old dustbuster. It ran out of juice in about 2 minutes. The new ones all use different batteries and would require setting up a new charging and storing station. Thank the Lord I had the idea of replacing the batteries . We did so and it is not as good as new it is better than new.
3,A little dated and doesn't get into advanced techniques,"If you've poured concrete before, you might already know all the details in here. Would be fine for a first timer doing a simple slab, but doesn't cover advanced techniques like stamping, etc"
4,Does the job at a reasonable price,"Bought two for a recent trip to Germany, Austria and Italy to charge an iPhone, an iPad, two cell phones and five digital camera batteries. Worked great. With all the things that needed charging, my only regret was not purchasing a third converter. Amazon's price and free delivery were first-rate, as usual."
1,useless,I bought it to use my hairdryer in germany and turkey. Couldn't use because does not work with hairdryer build after 1990.
5,"Mother, I Wanna F*ck You.","First off, people need to learn how to spell. There are millions of schools in this country, children. I suggest you attend one of them. No worries, they're free.Although riddled with a plethora of misspellings, I must agree with Mr. Gonzalez. (down there) This single would most definitely be better were it enhanced. But I disagree with his opinion on Five to One. I can't see how he can deem it ""too slow"". Marilyn Manson have done dozens of slow songs. (Yes, that IS proper grammar, as Marilyn Manson is a ""they"", not simply one person. Please give credit where credit is due.)I would consider anything under 8 dollars worthwhile in the purchase of this single. (That's 8 dollars American.) Although I am guilty of over-paying for Marilyn Manson merchandise myself.LMAO, I sound like a total D***"
2,Wow I paid $20 less and got the Printer with the Ink!,"LOLI know these companies like Epson make money on the ink, but when the Printer WITH this ink cost me $20 less...seems ridiculous. I tossed out my old printer to buy the Epson because the Ink was about $60. I should've checked to see how much replacement ink would cost (d'oh) for the Epson cause it looks like I'll be tossing my Epson in the trash now too. Cheaper to find a brand new printer on sale."
4,self seal,I have used this product on badly damaged soaker hosed with good results. The only caviot- make sure there is a good overlap as winde around the hose/pipe etc.
3,"Good tape, but not better than some others.","I wouldn't rave about this product. It's okay, but expensive for what you get. I much prefer Scotch High Performance Packaging Tape for the price."
1,this is defective,knob accumulates water under it...they sent me a second knob..same thing...and rubber feet mark the counter...poor design..thought it would be good cause their roaster ovens are good..oh well..its a return!
2,Mediocre but compleat,I've never been really impressed with Ruth Laredo's playing despite owning several of her recordings. This Rachmaninoff set fits that bill. It has all the Preludes but the playing is uninspired (and she even plays a blatantly wrong note in the haunting penultimate Prelude in the Op. 32 set). I thought the previous reviewer went overboard - mediocre recording but not awful. The set to get is Richter's selections from these pieces. THAT is magical playing.
2,Bad playing,"The performance is heavy-handed and there are both interpretation flaws and missed notes. It's further marred by some of the worst recording engineering work I have ever heard on a classical major-label release. Unfortunately, few other versions of this music have been issued. My advice is to wait for one to appear."
5,Beautiful!,"I've had this watch for about 3 years and it has worked flawlessly. Of the 3 years, I have worn it just about every day. Besides being beautiful, this watch is very well made. It's not light weight, the feel is substantial, without being bulky. It's very comfortable for daily wear and the band just hugs your wrist. I love unique pieces and I do not regret purchasing it!"
2,Jingle Bells,Not quite what I expected. I was hoping that it would be as good as the Rankin Bass Christmas programs.
1,Huge Disappointment,"I bought this software through Motorola, where it was much more expensive than it is here, about 4 months ago, to be able to transfer pictures easily and to customize ring tones for our 2 Motorola L6 phones. At first it worked great. Then after about 2 months the software would not recognize or connect to one of the phones. A couple of weeks later it no longer recognized or connected to the second phone either. There is no explanation, update, patch, or anything to fix the problem. I suggest before deciding to purchase this software, that you read over the software maker's troubleshooting message board. I discovered post after post of this same problem and the tech had no answer that corrects it. I wish I had not wasted my money on this software."
2,May not work with your CD/DVD-ROM... or your Verizon motorola phone.,"The CD did not read with my desktop pc - it kept tying the PC up - to the point where it would not respond.It did, however, work on my laptop pc. The program updated itself to the newext version of free, which was a pleasant surprise.However, when it came to actually doing anything with my phone, it wouldn't connect because Verizon apparently locks their phones down (because they want to charge you for the airtime and/or content).The program itself looked like a well written application, it's just not meant to be for all motorola phones, especailly Verizon models."
1,False Statement,"Motorola Mobile Phone Tools 4.0 for all Motorola Phones [Retail Packaged]This is not a true statement, only works on some motorola phones. Very missleading. Don't buy this product unless you verify that it will work with your phone."
5,"Speedy Delivery, Quality Item, and low price","Ordered my item, and had it within a week, which was much faster than I expected. I had been wanting the phone tools program for a while but just couldnt afford it. I decided to look on amazon and was pleasantly surprised to find it at a very reasonable price. You get a BIG thumbs up from me."
1,save your money,"I bought this to download the photos off my phone to save spending .75 each to phone mail them to myself.It connected fine to my phone and laptop, loads my contacts, etc.. Fine, but it will NOT even show the multimedia connection as being active. I have loaded it, and reloaded it so many times I am wondering if I will wear out the CD!!Save your money, it is not worth it. Unless you are looking to back up your phone contacts and move your outlook contacts over to your phone, and or, use the USB connector for a portable charging unit which is another thing it works well at. But if you want to down load photos or movies, forget it."
4,It's Great!,"Since it arrived a little late, I really have no complaints about this product. I think of it this way, there is no need downloading music you have and paying a fee for a 30 second song."
1,still not working,"bought the phone tools 4.0 after reading the claims of the package. I just wanted to back up and interface with outlook. After hours of research and trouble-shooting, it's still not working."
1,Motorola Phone Tools -- Research First!!,"Please make sure your Motorola phone supports the function of Phone Tools you are looking for. Not all functions are available with all motorola phones. For example, my phone the Motorola W385, does NOT support the MultiMedia Studio. I went through the trouble to prepare my ringtones for transfer, but MMS wasn't on the menu. Bummer."
2,Frustrating -- Not for the faint of heart or short of patience,"I had the old version of Motorola phone tools for my old phone. When I got my new phone, I got the new software hoping it'd be better, but it isn't.I've been installing this software, hoping that it would detect my phone for the past TWO HOURS. I've gone through the update process THREE TIMES. And I'm still staring at the little clock spinning around while it searches for my phone. It is a very frustrating setup experience.Once it finally works, it's OK... a little archaic in its interface, but just fine. I believe its the only way to get files to/from most Motorola phones. The import/export mechanism is a little overly technical, but eventually I got it to work."
4,"Good product, great value.",The product is great for what was promised. I just had bigger expectations: thought it would allow me to manage mobile applications and other stuff on both phone memory and the card.
3,Its an ok product,My husband purchased a Razor V3 phone for me for valentines day. He saw that i could make my own ring tones and such with this. He then searched the internet and found if we had purchased thru Cingular it was like $50. Then we found it at this place and the price was fabulous. Unfortunately the shipping dates werent even close to what Amazon said they would be ... all in all it took from shipping date of Feb 15th till March 8 (with 4 phone calls to the company customer service person) to get it finally.
1,Doesn't support MicroSD memory,"Don't buy this product if you expect it to work with a v3M MicroSD chip. Haven't found a workaround yet, and have to manually move MP3's from the main memory. What a pain ... I'd return the software and cables if the license/warranty would allow it."
5,An essential kit for E815,"When I ordered this product, I was preety skeptical..But when recieved the product , I am glad that it is worth spending. It gets your outlook contact synched.I don't use calendar so I don't bother. I was half satisfied. But wait..There was another cd in the package.After installing both I was 100% satisfied for the money I spend.Second one was a bonus CD.. which has wallpaper and lots of ring tones (MP3). Now I am having my favourite songs..It comes with two USB cables. Two CD'S. One from Motorola and other from A1 wireless.. Perfect installation guide..I didn't see any problems with both the software. As usual I was over confidence .. But manual is perfect..Its like abc..Good quality software from motorola.Make you E815 more Powerful and an exiting toy..You don't need Ipod any more..Good luck"
5,"One word ""Fantastic !"" Does everthing it says it does.","Allows me to synchronize my contact with Outlook & use my phone as a modem. I can transfer pictures and ringtones from my computer to my phone and from my phone to my computer. It even works with my wife's Verizon V3m, some tinkering was required to get the multimedia features to work on the Verizon phone (instructions were supplied my the vendor), but at the end everything works great!! As an added benefit if I get a new phone I don't have to worry because this kit works with almost all Motorola phones."
2,Not compatible with my brand new K1m KRZR,"As my title spells out this software could not acess my phone. It was running fine. the phone flashed when pluged in and was set to default USB connection. The computer AND the software knew when it was connected however phone tools thought about it for 3 minutes and displayed ' not a recognized phone, would you like to update the list of compatible phones?'Clicked yes, after a quick download. retried many times same result.So it looks sharp and probably works with most motorola's just not my Krazr. dont expect any help from Motorola they wont help unless you buy it from their website for 50$"
3,It works kinda,"This product lets me sync my email, address book ... but will not let me move pictures from my Verizon Motorola RAZR V3m phone to my computer."
2,Call to confirm that it's the correct edition,"As other reviewers have pointed out, the edition being sold here seems to be some type of Asian edition as it has virtually all Asian characters on the CD. I installed the software, but it wouldn't detect my phone.After trying to resolve the problem on my own, I finally contacted Motorola tech support, who were extremely helpful. Nothing about this edition matched what Motorola was telling me--the CD menus were wrong, the options were different, the serial number didn't have the right string. Finally, after I verified the purchase, Motorola sent me a link to the legitimate U.S. version of the software, and that detected my phone right away, and it's working fine.If you order from here, be sure they send you the correct edition, not the Asian version they sent me and several others."
1,Motorola phone tools,"the product misrepresents itself it says it is compatable with the tundra VA76r when it is not, as soon as you load the program it does updates, then tells you to plug in your phone. It then tells you it is not compatable with the VA76r..........waste of money"
4,does what i wanted it to do.,"i wanted a way to download photos from my phone to my computer. this product allowed me to do that just fine. i haven't tried to use any of the other features, though."
3,It works fine on XP but Vista.....,I purchased this product for my RAZR V3 and it was working great until I upgraded my PC and the operating system to Vista. This software will not work on Vista however it was great on XP.
2,"nice idea, but many bugs","Don't wasn't your moneyI want you to know that this product is a waste, today's phones usually offer this future through the wireless provider online and soon it will be standard operating for the newer phones that come out.I wanted to get more out of my cell and for the price this seemed like a cool idea. But I ran into many problems first my phone would lose phone numbers which caused huge hassles, the sync operation would losses data, the blue tooth obviously interfered with other blue tooth instruments."
2,Piece of junk,"This pump came with my inflatable kayak. The kayak says ""Do not inflate past XXpsi, also do not underinflate."" Guess what, the pump has no air pressure gauge on it...so, um how do I know if I'm overinflating it?Also, pump is very difficult to push down...I'm a large, fairly strong male and this thing had me huffing and puffing, even before I got out to kayak!A third complaint...the hose is very flimsy.I meant to give it only 1 star, but couldn't edit it...I guess you can use it to inflate pool toys, if you have biceps like Chuck Norris...Look for a pump with a pressure gauge and sturdy hose..."
3,good guide to the top spots,"This is a good basic pocket guide with a nice laminated included. For the price it cannot be beat. But, if you are in Barcelona more than a couple of days, you will definitely want to supplement with more of the less obvious attractions and look for more off the beaten path treasures."
4,Top Ten Barcelona,"It was a gift for a young student who is going to Spain. I browsed throught it & it is, as usual, a great help. I would highly recommend any of the DK travel books. They are the best."
3,Currently the only English field guide to birds of Taiwan.,"Though someout outdated, this book still provides foreign birders with a useful and handy tool for identifying birds in Taiwan. Wonderful descriptions of each birds' habits and calls. Recommended to be used with newer, more comprehensive field guides that only have Chinese editions."
3,Gosh Darn!,"A scholarly work written in 1993. I must have seen the author interviewed about something and thought that sounded like an interesting book. It wasn't what I expected, but was still interesting. I read it in one day. I wonder how the statistics have changed in the past 17 years."
5,Suspense!!!!!,This book kept you on the edge of your seat!! I couldn't even put it down!! It kept you in constant suspision and it made your stomach turn everytime you read a new scene!! I'm not going to tell you too much about it because you have to read it yourself!!
5,Remarkable,An Amazing & Durable Phone that meets the needs of the business professional. Highly Recommend!
4,Refurbished - Good As New!,"In our offices we have the Norstar System which was purchased many years ago. When a phone breaks beyond repair I was grateful to find refurbished ones at a good price, since we are not at the point of replacing a whole system."
5,El Excelente Primer Album de La Union !!!!,Si quieren escuchar toda la fuerza y entusiasmo de La Union es este album donde se puede encontrar todo aparte de su creatividad...todos los temas son buenos bien ochenteros de la epoca..cuando escucho este album me transporta a esa epoca....incluso antes de comprarlo lo esta escuchando en mi Ipo...pero les voy a decir que un mp3 no es lo mismo que un Cd la calidad y volumen baja eso es innegable...bueno hablando del album es excelente creo se puede decir es el mas representativo del grupo no por algo esta el tema mas popular del grupo aunque me gusta mas el primer tema Sidaravia...super recomendable si lo tienen disfrutenlo!!!!!!!!!!!
2,No Pot-O-Gold,"Although this disk explains the period of Dylan's life that took him and his listeners down unexpected paths, it lacks any commentary from him and any actual performances other than those you've seen already. It does give insight to the performer's plight with his convictions and the vicious attacks by critics. It also includes some interesting commentary by producers who explain their adaptations to Dylan's unique recording styles. Especially with the Shot of Love album.If you expect footage of live performances, there is no pot-o-gold here!"
3,Documentary on the lowest period of Dylan's career,"This film chronicles what is generally considered to be the lowest period of Bob Dylans career. If it wasn't for parts of ""Infidels"" and ""Oh Mercy"" the period 1978 - 1989 would have been a total write-off. The beginnings of this period were his so-called gospel phase and although the religious references slowly tailed off they were still ever-present. The hard core gospel albums are particularly desolate because they are so one-dimiensional in tone. Sadly, this film does not contain new interviews with the man himself or with key collaborators such as Daniel Lanois and Mark Knoppler."
5,Excellent Game!,"I highly recommend this game, it is a lot of fun for any age group. My kids can play it alone, or we all can play together. Even a group of adults will enjoy this game. It really makes you use your imagination and get thinking, lots of fun!"
5,Great game to play with children,Played the game with our grandsons ( 7 and 4); they both enjoyed it. Highly recommended for families to have quality paly time with their children.
3,Disappointed!!!!,"I am very disappointed in the size of these. Must be for children!!The price is outrageous, too!! I received the blue and it is a very nice color."
5,Good quality used book.,"Good quality used book. A few highlighter mark here and there, but otherwise great. This is the book I wish we have used in college - half the price (even retail) and fifteen times the knowledge and clarity than the garbage we were forced to buy for textbooks."
3,"Bad GPS, already Opened","I haven't had good luck with this model yet. First one I received was broken. Called Garmin was told to contact Amazon as they would take 7-10 days to just repair it. Had a new one overnighted to me. Was sent out late so it didn't get here until after 8PM at night, Garmin was closed, couldn't get a new unlock code because Amazon sent faulty one. This next one I received was already opened, not even brand new like listed. Amazon also forgot to give me the return mailing label for the old one, as I do not have a way to print it."
2,Too complex.,I returned this item within 48 hours of receiving it because I found it very difficult to use. It is not intuitive and requires many hours of reading the manual and trying to apply what it says. I have worked in the IT arena for more than 25 years and do not tolerate IT products that cannot be easily understood and put to use right out of the box. This is one of those hard-to-use products.
5,Worked just like it said it would,"I had previously purchased a Magellan Explorist Handheld GPS and mapping software as a bundle. Within hours of opening the box I came to realize that there was no way that the Magellan GPS was going to make use of the mapping software. Fortunately that GPS unit was stolen prompting me to buy the Garmin eTrex Venture along with the North American mapping software and a 2 GB micro sd card from sandisk. It all worked flawlessly right out of the box. The microcard fit into a SD card adapter. I loaded the map software onto my laptop and plugged the SD card into my laptop and downloaded maps of areas of interest. I removed the micro SD card from the adapter and plugged it into the GPS unit and it actually worked to show detailed maps and points of interest (e.g. gas stations, restaurants, etc). On the road the unit worked just like a car nav system to direct you from point A to point B. I couldn't be happier."
1,Lack of creativity,"You can add this CD to your collection simply because you are a loyal fan of Bebel Gilberto. But are you really going to play this CD more than once? I do like the concept of remixing, because finding a good remix is like finding money in your pocket that you didn't know you have. But in this CD I found the remix disappointing. It lacks creativity in remixing and I felt I was in places like Radio Shack or Circuit City listening to an electronic keyboard. This remix could have been better."
2,Two + too = two,"Two reasons why it took two years to review Tanto Tempo. I wanted to like it because Amazon.com and my husband recommended it. Two reasonably reliable sources.Two talented parents equal talented offspring? Two songs I liked, Bananeira and August Day Song. The rest of the cd was too new age-y and too Yanni-like. Too much work was required to like Bebel's work. I gave it two stars."
4,Westie Art Print on Canvas,"This art print is adorable! Visitors to our home actually thought it was our Westie. It would be better, however, if they offered an option of a larger size. The print is quite small. Offering other breeds with the Mona Lisa would be a nice option as well. All in all, if you love Westies, you'll love this print!"
2,cell phone quality pictures and movies,"picture quality is poor about what you'd expect from an older cell phone, interface quality is poor.my daughter loves this camera thoughpicked it up for $20 at local ritzcamera going out of business saleanything above that is probably too much to pay"
3,My daughtor is very happy :),"I bought this camera for my daughter she is very happy with it , she is in 6 years old , and i cerebration to buy an other one for here because it was stolen in here school in sport day ."
3,the truth was,you didnt tell me u got this from a library this took the vaule down i wish i knew this i wouldnt order this.
4,"FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO READ ABOUT ELVIS AS AN HUMAN BEING, NOT AS A GOD !","I've been an ELVIS fan for more than 40 years and have read several books about him. Some present him as a god, with no faults and failures, but even we - that will love him forever - must realize he was human. Back in 1977, this must have been a sensation book, but nowadays, like ELVIS himself once said, he ""was tame compared to present performers"". I loved to read some episodes I've never heard about and I only regret that they are not mentioned chronologically. But of course this is a tell-all gossip and, for a serious biography, we must read PeterGuralnick's two volumes ""Last Train to Memphis"" and ""Careless Love""."
5,WELLL DONE,WAS PACKAGED WERY GOOD CAME CLEAN NO SCRATCHES OR DENTS EASY TO INSTALL AND WORKS GREAT LIKE THE UNDERMOUNT CONTROLS. DEFENETLY RECOMEND
3,Nice cars but not 2002 Tbird,"I mistakenly purchased this calendar thinking it would have at least one of the new 2002 Thunderbirds on it. It doesn't, it has 3-55, 3-56, 5-57, 1-62. Nice photos though."
1,Wade is in prison,"Wade Cook has been sentenced to seven years and four months in federal prison for income tax evasion, filing false tax returns and obstructing a tax investigation. He has a history of dishonest behavior, from securities violations in Arizona to prosecution by the Federal Trade Commission that he misrepresented earnings potential.What else do you need to know?"
2,GET YOUR KICKS on the real thing,"i love troups' work. almost every LP has turned CD, 'ceptin one, my fav (Bobby troup sings bobby troup), so why buy this just o.k., not so great CD? yes, i gave it a try...its maybe a 2 on the scale. hey, JUST GO BUY A BOBBY TROUP CD...& get your kicks on the REAL thing."
5,"Amazing. Great CD, life changing live show.","Explosions in the Sky is the most amazing band that I have ever seen play live. They really put their hearts into their music and their show. They truly must be experienced in order to understand. Be prepared to scream, cry, or stoically stare with your mouth open."
5,Kelly Ripa loved it!,"I heard about this book from Kelly and Regis when they both raved about it on their talk show. I bought it and I'm as excited about it a they are. It's everything they promised and more -- and it's actually fun to read which I never thought I'd ever say about a ""job"" book."
4,Gets the job done,"I remove about 6 or 7 sets of wipers a day in the auto glass business... This is the way to go for most of the pesky wiper arms that seem to get stuck to the wiper stud over time. Living in New England, this is a handy tool that I use about once every other day for that one PITA wiper arm that won't come off by asking nicely, I have found that if you back the wiper nut off about 90% then slip this baby right over the nut with its feet under the base of the wiper arm, and twist slowly until there is a ton of pressure on the tool, a small wiggle of the wiper arm should pop the arm off the stud, if not, place a panel tool under the wiper arm with the puller on an tightened and give the panel tool a short but firm pry, the arm should pop right off, then remove the wiper nut then lift wiper arm off stud"
1,Worthless Paper Weight?,"Stay away from, it does not even qualify as a paper weight. Too small piece and the knob made of thin and cheap plastic, does not fit the windshield wiper pivot arm, even if it did, the knob is made cheaply and weak that it separates from the little structure upon the minmum amount of torque."
5,Always Use The Right Tool,"There's an old saying I just made up, ""Don't try to do surgery with a spoon."" Same thing applies, in principle anyhow, when you've got to take a wiper arm off a splined shaft. Don't use pliers or a crowbar; get one of these Windshield Wiper Arm Pullers. Works right, works the first time and doesn't hurt a bit.Get one. You'll like it."
3,Full of errors,"Quite a few errors in the problem sets, especially when compared to a better pharm calc book (Ansel and Stoklosa). However, the problems in this are much better for real world applications. The theory is better in other sources, he kind of has a funny way of looking at some things, like acid-base chemistry. Pick it up if required for a course. If you're a sado-masochist and are reading it for fun, I'm not sure if there is a better reference for the field out there yet, my experience is limited."
2,A true dissappointment,"Don't get me wrong, I love Queensryche, they are an incredible band. I appreicate the fact that they are venturing into another concept album w/a pretty cool concept (forgotten pieces of artwork, that must have taken some time to think of). The music is all mid-tempo contemporary rock, a huge departure from their sound that made them who they are. It saddens me to say that I don't like a single song on the album. I give it two stars because of the concept and it's Queensryche."
2,Strike Three,"I know that QR doesn&#65533;t like to be defined by a style and they try hard to not repeat their previous album(s), but who are they kidding? This album is the same drivel as the &#65533;Ear&#65533; album and Q2K. Gone are the meaningful lyrics. Gone is the powerful music that made your heart pump. Gone are Geoff&#65533;s passionate vocals. (And after seeing him live again, I know he still has it in him.) I will say Tribe is better than HitNF and Q2K, however it is still just another stripped down, watered away, meaningless mess.Promised Land was their last good album."
3,"Not good, but not bad either......","Read ""Dice's"" review of this CD. He pretty much sums it all up.I really like a couple of tracks on this CD. A few tracks are decent and a few tracks just plain suck. Anyone who has given this CD a rating of 1 or 5 stars is being a little too biased. I wanted to give this CD a 2 1/2 star rating so I had to bump it up to 3 stars because 2 stars seemed a little too low. Now I have to decide if I want to hang on to this CD or get rid of it. It's really that close of a call. In the meantime I'll keep listening to my other four Queensryche CD's; Operation Mindcrime, Empire, Promised Land (my personal favorite), and their ""Greatest Hits""."
3,Not bad but not great,"Well, it's better than the last couple but it's no ""Mindcrime,"" ""Empire,"" or ""Promised Land."" I always prefer their darker stuff. Tracks ""Open"" and ""Art of Life"" are hotspots and track 6 reminds me of ""Silent Lucidity"" because of the orchestration. I guess it's not fair to expect them to meet their past successes it just seems all the once killer rock bands have dried up. The Ryche always deliver live though..."
1,Stay away from this product-Not even a star!,"This sounds like a good product, but it is not and the company is bad about their customer service. Used the photobank to store all my racing photos while covering a NASCAR race, worked well. Downloaded the images right there and kept on shooting. Went home to download to the computer, everything went fine. Only when I was finished downloading to the CPU the thing still said there were images on the HD. So I went into the HD through My computer and cleared them off, thinking that would clear it off. Nope, it still said there were images there. Went a step further and formated the thing. Did that fix it. Nope, all it did was remove if from this earth. DOS doesn't even see it. The only way it is seen by the computer is if the hard cover is taken off and then DOS will read it. But it will not fix it back to the FAT32 format. There is a driver for it on their website but it is for the card reader side of it not the HD.Bad product, Buyer be ware...."
2,leather repair kit,"product is okay, but these things really don't work that well. I think once leather tears, you are just out of luck."
3,Non Fiction,"One of those bloodsucking drain the students dry of cash evil bastich series of textbooks. Some useful information, but probably up to version 27 of its cash gathering exercise by now. Exactly what textbooks should not be, a prime example of a RIP OFF, if there ever was one."
3,Could be better,"I bought this book because of glowing reviews. I have found this book to be useful and indeed I have bought software based on what I've read. At the same time I have to confess I think the book could be much better. What the author refrains from doing is critical and comparative analysis. To give one example, ChessBase7 and Chess Assistant 5.0 could be critically compared. To give another example, some of the shortcomings of Bookup 1.6.2 could be described. An author such as John Nunn would have combined both technical virtuosity and chess erudition to give a revealing analysis of the strengths and shortcomings of the chess software currently available."
2,Live Version - songs are rather weak,"This album has only the live versions, which are not nearly as good as the recorded versions, IMHO. The ""reggae version"" of Keep on Loving You is especially regretable."
4,Another Good Cruising Handbook,Helps the reader to look at their goals clearly and to move from that to action. I would put this book in short list of books for anyone considering going offshore and wanting to learn what they need to know ahead of time.
2,"poor noise filtering, no returned supported",Fits nicely and works about as good as you might expect for only $20. Too much noise while I'm driving. I tried to return the product through the seller but they did not respond to my email.
1,Doesn't seem to work,"I was highly disappointed in these pads. I've tried them with two dogs and neither one would go to the bathroom on them, no matter what I did to make sure they would. They were also too small for the holder they were supposed to fit inside, which made it easier for my dog to pull them loose from the holder and shred them up. Instead of helping me house break my dogs, they just made more work for me, because I would end up with a mess from my puppy using my floor as a bathroom, as well as having to clean up the shredded potty pads. Honestly, my first dog was ""litter box"" trained in a box lined with news papers, and I think that the news papers worked work better for training then these puppy pads."
5,Puppy pads,This product works great. And absorbed very very well. Even a full bowl of water didn't make a mess and was completely absorbed. I was very pleased with these puppy pads
3,not too bad,it was a good quantity for the price. the pads are much smaller than i was expecting. the ones i buy from wal-mart or dollar general are much bigger. but i wanted to buy in gross hoping to scale down on cost but it scaled down the pad too.
1,too small and does not absorb as well as it states,I purchase these Neat 'n Dry floor pads for my yorkie and I still have an overspill onto my floor when these pads are used. Now I have a big bag of pads that are useless. I have to use two pads in order to avoid my floor from getting wet. Waste of $$
3,Pee Pee Pads for Puppies,"The pads were small and a little expensive. I say expensive because I found peepee pads at my local grocery store for less money, there were more pads per package and the pads were larger. The pads I ordered from Amazon were of good quality it just boiled down to price."
4,Training Pads,"Our dog is just 5 lbs, so this pad works well. Having the tray to go along with it is a must."
5,"Love the Price, Use Them All The Time (unfortunately)","I have two Yorkies who refuse to be 100% housebroken. These pads have saved my floors countless times. I do, however, recommend that you purchase the tray to insert them in. If you use the pad alone and the pups pee on the corner of the pad, it will end up on the floor too. The tray ensures a dry floor. I have found these pads to be high quality yet less expensive than you can find at local pet stores. And of course Amazon Prime ships fast and free.Iris Training Pad Holder, Regular"
4,Great value but...,"This is probably the best value all around every time i am in the market looking to buy pads.The only thing i must mention is that every single case i may get there is always a few pads that when you go to pull them the plastic gets ripped so its automatically for waste.Either than that they absorb just fine, they feel alright and are easily disposed."
3,Don't buy the regular--it's half size though same quality,"I have a Chihuahua mix (now 5 months and approx 8 pounds) and I bought the regular size. Somehow I didn't think it would be that small--about half the size of the large pad. Not sure why they would even make a puppy pad this small. It's too small for a puppy and the size would be really useless for a puppy in training. I did, however, find use for this small size. I combine this pad with a large pad and covers the entire bottom of the crate (two large pads would overlap too much). In the beginning, this worked great, but now my puppy is starting to shred this pad. Part of it could be boredom when he is left home alone, but usually the large pad (different brand; same quality)is intact. Shouldn't both pads be shredded? The overall quality of the Iris pad is great. I haven't had any problems with leakage. I've tried at least a dozen different brands and came across a few that are really thin and had leakage problems."
1,poor quality of product and i have a small dog...,"I have a 3lb. Maltese teacup, tiny little thing and she is only able to use the wee wee pads once, maybe twice if we're lucky.... it doesn't absorb well, at all.... price is good but quality is very poor."
1,"Horrible, horrible product. Get yourself Wee-Wee brand","I reviewed the Wee-Wee brand pads quite some time ago and I was VERY happy with them: [..] This past summer a fellow Amazonian asked if I had tried the Iris Neat n' Dry pads and was interested in my comparison. I just ordered these pads and all I can say is, I've been RIPPED OFF. These are absolutely horrible pads. I will provide a link to my review of the Wee-Wee pads and if you view the comments, you will find my response & a brief comparison of the two brands: [..]To sum up: these pads are smaller (17.5X23"" compared to Wee-Wee's 22X23""), less absorbent (more like not at all), thin, cheap, with a plastic backing thinner than a grocery bag only attached along the edges. You pay $21/100 pads of Neat n' Dry to $28/150 pads of Wee-Wee - bigger pad, better quality, & more of them for only $8 more."
5,These saved my carpet!,"FINALLY a pee pad that my dog likes. He is a 1 1/2 year old Yorkie and has been very hard to house train. I have tried the PeeSmart brand, the Natures Miracle brand, and several other brands I can't remember. These Neat 'n Dry are leak proof and are good with odor control. My dog will actuallty pee on them rather than aiming for the edge. My only complaint is that they are a little small. I bought the regular size and have to use two of them to get about the same coverage as the other brands. I will buy bigger ones next time."
4,puppy pads,my puppy took right to them with no accidents the size is perfect and the price is right chi chi and i both thank you
2,What Happened to this Product?,"When I bought these pads at Amazon last year, a 50-pack was $11.99 -- now its $26.99! Does anyone know why this happened?The pads themselves are fine and work beautifully with the pad holder, but I'm protesting against this price.UPDATE APRIL 19, 2008In my earlier review, I downrated the product for the price, which went through the roof, but still paid respect to the quality.I just got a package from Amazon for $19.99 -- a better price. But the pads simply don't absorb. I tried a few and rocketed the package back to Amazon."
1,This product sucks...,Bought it after reading reviews but it sucks. Its quality is worse than those generic ones you can find at pet stores.
1,Attract your pet then leak.,"The pups go on these fine but I would not describe them as ""floor protection"" Fluid in one side almost equals the fluid out on the other."
2,Skip buying these!!!,"These puppy pee pads are way too small to be of any use since they do not cover enough area to keep a puppy from missing the center of the pad. My 15 pound, 10 week old Dalmatian tries to use them but has to hit them spot on in the center in order for them to provide proper protection. Skip these and buy the ones carried by Costco that are larger, thicker and cheaper, and only 17 cents each!"
5,Frida. Movie sound track,"Great sound track. As best I remember, had most if not all of the songs and music from the movie."
3,THE ESSENTIAL RAY PRICE,"I was looking for a cd with all of his great songs spanning the decades of his career. This compilation begins with his early days when he sounds exactly like Hank Williams. I was looking for his trademark sound, the 4,4 shuffle beat. There are more early hits ( when he sounds like Hank ) then when he came into his own. This is still a good cd for any fan but, now I have to look for some of the same songs which are on this cd with his own trademark voice."
3,"Ok, but there's better books out there.","The book is ok, but we've ordered much better books. This is worth having, but it's not my top choice. See some of my other reviews for my favorite."
2,Difficult and not good unless you are good!,"Please don't discard this review because I am only 11. I consider my self to be a good reader and good chess player for my age.Good points:The Book covers a wide range of different tactics. A very, very good player will probably benefit from them.Bad points:The tests put me down as a very bad player even though i win a lot, even against some adults at the chess club. A lot of the stuff is tuff and I don't see why I would need to figure out a very deep, deep idea that only a world champion can fiture out to make me do well on the tests in the book. It kind of puts a moderately good player down. I would give this book one or two more stars if it advertized its self as a book for more advanced players."
4,Well Rounded - Very General Examples - Some Typos,"This is a very well-rounded general guide to tactics for a lower rated chess player (say 800 to 1200) - not too difficult, not overly easy. Tactics and Opening Chess Traps are effective ways to efficiently improve your results in practical play. Aren't most amateur games won or lost because of a tactical mistake or falling for some dumb opening trap? Well, then get with it and improve what will get you better results!The sample tactics are very well chosen to represent what you are most commonly going to find in practical play. What I found disapointing is that even with the ""revised"" edition, there continues to be a lot of typos - mostly silly stuff, but annoying.Still, this book is on my recomended list!"
4,Helpful,This book teaches you basic chess tactics. I think it is a very helpful read for players that are just starting their chess development. I contains all the needed tactics and gives you a good overview of how they can be used and when to look around for them.
2,Strangely overrated,"I really don't understand the judgements of the other reviewers. To me this book is a very poor way to learn tactics. The basic themes are presented in a sketchy way, and there are nowhere near enough examples of them to allow the reader to really learn to recognize the patterns involved. Apparently Seirawan's approach works well for some, but I got nothing from this book compared to Reinfeld's simpler but more extensive book of combos. The same goes for Seirawan's writing style. I guess some people like it, but to me his exaggerated folksiness is like fingernails on a blackboard. Be warned that this book is not for everyone!"
5,wow,"this is my first experience with rilo kiley (yes i know late bloomer) but all i can say is this album is amazing. the songs are not too soft and not too hard. i highly recommend this album to anone who is ""sick of the girl fronted band"" it will totally change their mind."
5,Well Worth the Wait,"After falling in love with their last album, ""Take-Offs and Landings,"" I could only hope that their latest effort could be as good. After the first listen, I knew that this album exceeded my wildest expectations. There are many catchy songs, but I think my favorite aspect of Rilo Kiley is the way they can make a song shift from mellow to total rock. It's hard to pick a favorite song on here, but ""Spectacular Views"" is incredible, as is the title track and ""Paint's Peeling."" If you are a fan at all of ""Take-Offs and Landings"" or their previous EP, this album will not disappoint."
3,Wanted it due to false advertising!,I like my mermaid doll b/c it lights up. I thought I was going to be able to use it in the water b/c on the commercial they do this but my mom said it will break it so I can't. Mom's input: the commercial attracted her to this toy which was one of her few requests for Christmas. She plays with it some and little brother got a hold of it and played with it in the sink. Luckily he mainly got the hair wet only and it still seems to still work ok.
4,Beautiful Doll,"My 4 year old loves this doll. Day two, after putting it in water twice, the lights won't turn off so the tail is green all the time. I imagine the batteries will die soon and it bothers my daughter that the lights never go off. But the voice is still good and the other lights still work and she does still love it. I would recommend the doll but might try not putting it in water next time."
1,Very disappointing toy!,"I bought this toy for my 3 year old daughter (who ADORES Ariel). It is a very beautiful doll. However, it is a bath toy that ceases to function once it is placed in the bath! Once she placed the doll in the tub a couple of times it's singing sounded strange and then finally quit singing altogether. Needless to say, my daughter was quite upset. Honestly, I am simply amazed that Disney ever allowed this toy on the market... Like I stated earlier, VERY disappinting purchase!"
2,cute but don't put in water,this is a cute toy for any little mermaid fan but it did not last long; It worked great for about a month and then I purchased new batteries which cost about $8.00 and shortly after it stopped working. There was some corrosion when I opened the battery case. I will be contacting the manufacturer.
4,6 months and counting...,"My girls got these from Santa, they regularly play with them. The hair is long enough for gomu & pintomen (sorry, do not know the english works for their hair things...), in other words, bands and things they stick in the hair.We do not put these in water after reading that they stopped advertising them as being water proof..."
5,Moving in the right direction,"Insightful, atmospheric, melodic, funky and sometimes just a little bit weird; Mount Florida's first album ""Arrived Pheonix"" has become a mainstay in my collection of late. Disillusioned by the monotany and lack of originality in much electronica, I think that this album puts a firm foot in the right direction showcasing a diverse talent and subversive intellect at work. It may take a couple of good turns to see what's going on here but, at less than ten bucks, well worth the money."
2,It doesn't wake me up,"It would have been great if it actually woke me up. I end up with my arm under my pillow too often, and the alarm is too quiet to wake me up. I returned it."
1,Aboslutely ridiculous.,"I don't know if the ""theory"" works or not, because the watch is total garbage. I have other complaints, but I'll just list the biggest. The $5 watch that costs $100 comes with a very soft beep for an alarm. You cannot make it louder in any way. So, the watch may or may not wake you up assuming it's right next to you, but once you put your wrist under a blanket, it's completely inaudible. In the summer, if you sleep without a blanket, it might wake you up. However, if you care at all when you wake up, set a real alarm also, because this one will probably not wake you up at all. I fully support their right to charge $100 for a $5 watch that includes some new inventive ""technology,"" but it would be nice if they made it to actually work. I have no other description of the implementation of this idea other than: ridiculous. I'm sure they'll fix this problem at some point, and I think they now have a $200 version that vibrates. Do not buy this watch until they fix this problem."
4,"it works, but buy the ""pro"" model","It works as advertised, but I wish I had spent the extra few dollars on the ""Pro"" model. I skipped it as the synching didn't seem very useful (and is PC-only), and hadn't realized that the standard model doesn't have the vibrating alarm.Thus, about one in ten mornings I can't hear the alarm from under the blankets at all. Also it isn't very pleasant for bedmates. On top of that, I decided to start tracking my sleep patterns in a spreadsheet... that synching would come in handy after all.So: an overall good product. If you have sleep problems, give one of their models a try before taking the medical route."
2,Looks pretty but this is not the same Appleseed,"This looks very good. The visuals are amazing on an HDTV. I am about 30 mins into the movie and I have to say that the story, acting and animation is horrible.First the actors from the first do not lend their voices to this one.Some of the characters seem to be different than from the first movie. The acting is pretty stiff and cliche (the tough cyborg guy is annoying).Some of the fights are just stupid for stupids sake. I mean does Duenan and Briarious need to spin and do cartwheels while shooting? It doesn't even look cool, just stupid.Why did they go with CGI models 100% this time? Did the old animated cells not work anymore? It sure looked a LOT better.The events from the first movie don't even seem to play a part at all which is a shame.I loved the first movie but I wouldn't consider this deserving of the same name. I will be selling this shortly as I regret buying it.2 stars just because if you mute it, it looks very sharp."
2,Yawn inducing,"I felt the animation was very well done. What brought the movie down for me were the long moments of NO ACTION filled instead with long moments of boring dialouge. The whole ""being posessed"" idea has been done too many times before and seemed like an easy way out when it came to creating the plot for this movie. The main character says Riorios so many times they should have put a count at the bottom of the screen.PROS: Great animationCONS: Unengaging storylineLong moments without any action"
5,"A great sequel to an amazing original, and on Blu-ray!","The original Appleseed, in my opinion, was a masterpiece. I had doubts when I heard of a sequel, and how it was being criticized. After watching Appleseed: Ex Machina, I almost wonder if the reviewers and I watched the same film. I found Ex Machina to take me into the neo-future of Olympus with it's new cell-shaded look and amazing 3D animation. The story, still deep and twisted, the action, mind-blowing, and the quality of work is top-notch. I have only praises to give to this masterpiece, and urge others to not miss out on the phenomenon that is Appleseed: Ex Machina."
2,not as good as I had hoped,"I was a little disappointed in the second appleseed movie. The action was there, it just all felt re-hashed. The finale was a total matrix rip off. The action scenes were OK, it just wasn't as cutting edge as the first. I was also surprised to see the Blue-ray only had a dolby digital sound track. No new generation codec. If you like anime, you'll probably enjoy it, if you don't, I wouldn't suggest this as your first view. I would have been happy to have rented this one, not purchased."
4,Good for anime fans,I felt that this was an anime that I enjoyed. I would call myself an average anime fan that really felt that this movie pulled its weight. My wife who also enjoyed it is not that much of a anime fan at all! This was a good action anime that I felt served its purpose. I would recommend it to anyone who is into action and not so much into plot.
5,Patients Guide To Outstanding Breast Cancer Care,"I started reading this book as I left the surgeons office and my fears started to go away too. This book is a must if you have breast cancer. It will take you step by step through what's next to what we should be asking the doctors.But more importantly, it will and does bring back the hope. Written by a professional who understands we all get scared!I have a copy to give my family doctor. Why? So the next women who is waiting to see the surgeon can read and feel the hope and help that is out there for us all."
5,THIS GRAFFITI BOOK HAS IT ALL!!!,"Anyone who loves graffiti and knows anything about it will not be able to put this book down!!! It is packed full of illegal bombing, tags, pieces and huge productions from all over NYC( and yes, pieces can be illegal too- check out some of the great spreads along the Amtrak lines of NYC in the first part of the book). There are so many awesome and original quotes from the graff artists on all types of topics like the paint they use and how they describe their style and even how they got into graffiti. It is really cool that the authors interviewed ALL the graff writers themselves and even have their tags and action shots to prove it. You can really get inside these guys heads!! Overall this book is a must have for anyone interested in graffiti. The panoramic double-page photo spreads and 3 FOOT FOLD-OUTS along with the unforgettable interviews are INCREDIBLE!!!"
2,"Wiccan ""Light""","I suppose it is nice for someone dabbling in Pagan faiths, very basic with some introduction. I thought it was a written a bit condescendingly and I have a problem with all of the rhyming spells. It is very distracting."
5,Love it,"I just anything that has to do with spells, natural, herbs and the family. My family loves the new things I have done around the house.Thanks,Debbie"
3,Cottage Witchery simple is sometimes good!,"I know there has been some debate on the style of Llewellyn writers as being too simple, but the matter of the fact is...there are so many new witches who are begining the craft, and need to understand that you don't need large ridiculous words to sound Magickal and Important: being a real Witch is about simplicity and using what you already have! I like Ms Dugan's conversational approach, which is much more interesting than reading a book that sounds like a scientific thesis report!(Might i add that Silver Ravenwolf is very estabilshed and respected Witch who also has a laid-back writing style which is why its so affective), Witch Craft should be relaxing and fun (yes we also have to be respectful and aware of what we do,) but its about community.Its Simple, to the point, and easy to comprehend.Spirit understands us best when we are at our purest of heart, which is our simpliest"
2,50 Gay-Friendly Places to Live for the Wealthy,"The majority of the places the authors recommend have jobs with a median income of $40,000 to $70,000, yet the median house prices are $500,000 to over $1,500,000. It seems ludicrous to recommend a town where most working people will have to live in apartments.For example, they recommend Boulder, CO where the median single-family home price is $535,000 and the median household income is $44,748. The typical household would have to save 50% of its pre-tax income for 4.8 years to put a 20% down payment on that typical house.They warn that Denver, CO can be cold at night even in the summer but no similar warning is given about Boulder, CO.They warn that the summer is hot and humid in Saint Petersburg, FL but give no such warning about Wilton Manors, FL, Key West, FL or any other recommended city in FL."
5,Lovely Book,"I just love this book. It has monthwise sections saying which food to start when. I love the idea that you steam your vegetables first and then mix it with milk and puree it for the baby. This way I will be able to mix milk in my baby food without heating it and destroying some vitamins. The pictures are so very adorable too. It also has list of necessary and useful models of bibs, utensils, bowls and cups. You get so many types in the market these days and as a new mom you want to buy them all. This book gives you some idea of the useful ones."
5,"Secrets, Mysteries, and Tons of Romance,","I have had a lot of my friends ask me what the Lambert series is about. I tell them, ""secrets, mysteries, and tons of romance."" You just have to buy the whole set and read it. I loved all the books and the plot left me dying for more! What next Ms. Murray? Whatever it is just make it soon, okay? (Die Hard Murray Fan, Here!)"
2,The Book Sucks,"My kindle library has nearly 100 books. This is only the second review I've written, because all other 98 books were actually good. They had logical order, they were written clearly, they didn't use confusing jargon, and so on. This book is terrible in so many ways.First of all, do not purchase if you are a beginner, like me. You will only get confused. Their is jargon a plenty, poorly articular ideas scattered into different sections, and many other problems. However, I haven't purchased any other bowling books. It's possible all bowling books are the same, I have no idea."
5,Excellent reading,I recommend this book for anyone who wants to improve their score. Great helpful hints and information.
1,Are you kidding me?,"First of all this movie is a ""B"" at best. Filmed in Seattle with some of the worst acting and camera work that I have seen in some time.My suggestion to you is avoid at all costs that is unless you like garbage then by all means enjoy."
2,"And tell me again how is this ""new""music?","Maybe I'm showing my age but Sigur Ros aren't breaking new ground here. Rather,they're clearly pinching from a treasure chest of other artists. Most evident: Red House Painters,Dif Juz and This Mortal Coil to name a few from the band roster of the 4AD label. 4AD had been putting out this type of atmospheric wallpaper almost 20 years before Sigur Ros ever came onto the scene. It's interesting to hear NPR and Rolling Stone christen Sigur Ros under the rubric of ""post-rock""when the music they make would've been considered simply ""goth""not even less than 5 years ago.Dare I say,Sigur Ros's latest CD doesn't pack nearly as much instrumental punch as,say,Dead Can Dance,Piano Magic or Scorn. It's not bad as background music,I'll give it that much. Still, it's not nearly as engaging as the blatantly evident influences they acquire their sound from. If you simply MUST have this CD, I'd recommend NOT paying [money] and seeing about getting a used copy."
4,Suprising good for a not-so-known band,"I stumbled across this album while doing some reading on Radiohead. I bought the album and gave them a shot, why not right? I must admit, I was quite suprised. The best way I can descripe this album is it is like an eerie soundtrack to life. The vocals are delicate and light and you think you know what he is saying but you are wrong; it is gibberish. The music is light, flowing an melodic. Listen with headphones for best effect. This is an album to enjoy."
2,"How do you say ""This is bad"" in Hopelandic?","Sooooooo, I read all the Sigur Ros/( ) reviews here on Amazon (""sheer beauty"" ""I cried several times during this CD"" etc etc) and figured OK - I'll give ( ) a shot. I own the previous disk - which I think is so-so. And.........This has got to be the most overrated load of hooey since ""Kid A."" There's nothing memorable here; the music's not even that interesting. I thought maybe a second listen might help, but no. The main problem is the singer has only one phrase which he repeats on every song - apparently in lieu of being able to write actual lyrics. It sounds like ""OOO-SIGH-OH,"" or something, and becomes even MORE tedious and irritating the second time around. I dunno. The black lipstick and fingernail polish crowd might dig it after they've skipped their lithium treatments, but ( ) doesn't do it for me. ..."
1,Music for mosquitos,"I became interested in Sigur Ros () after finding a YouTube video segment of a live performance of Track 7. I wish that I had not spent money on this album.The first few tracks really set the tone for the album. Music for mosquitos, with Asian influences. As is noted by other reviewers, the lead singer repeats a nonsense word/phrase over and over, throughout the album. The music is conventional and droning. The first tracks contain something that is very reminiscent of a mosquito buzzing my ear while I try to sleep. This has more in common with jazz than rock, more like what a rock band might do if they had to fill an hour jam session with atmospheric stuff.This isn't electronic, its too annoying to be ambient, and has too much conventional rock to be ""post-rock."" I recommend Debussy's Jeaux, and Jean-Michel Jarre's Zoolook to this. (Right now I'm listening to Corsican Chant to get this out of my head.)"
5,"awesome, simply awesome","screw the editor' review - it takes bands like this to define new music. they are the reason that the phrase ""Everything's been done before"" simply doesn't hold any water.Beautiful disc!"
5,I've Retyped a Review for this 12 times now,"And none of them give this album enough credit. Scarier still, they are even better live.I've read many negative reviews. I guess this band is hard to get into, but after I heard Track 4 for the first time, I was hooked. Maybe it's just that we are in a pop world devoid of any dynamics that makes them sing out to me. Maybe I'm tired of the same old verse-chorus-verse-chorus-(maybe solo)-chorus two-minute deal that seems to be the current formula of music...But this album talks to me. With words that I don't know. I have listened to this album 40 times over waiting in a Cincinatti Airport waiting for my standby tickets to clear... and I never tired of it.My only gripe (If there was a 4.5 stars) is that songs 1-4 and 8 sing out so well that 5-7 falls into a bit of a lull. They're not bad by any means, but I think the others are just stronger."
3,Nice Viloin,This violin is just what I was looking for. It should be plenty sufficient until it is time to move to the next level.
3,"A little quaint, but not bad.","I bought this out of curiosity after hearing Don McLean's very good new album of songs by Marty Robbins.I think Don McLean's versions are improvements on these, but that's not fair since many of the tracks on this album were recorded in mono in the 1950s, and are very much period pieces.Plenty of well known songs here, many penned by Robbins, like the classic ""El Paso"". The spinoff songs from that are pretty weak though. Songs by others include ""Singing the Blues"" and Hal David and Burt Bacharach's cute ""The Story of My Life"". Hank Williams' ""Kaw Liga"" is another amusing but catchy song that stands out.Disc one is the best, and really quite a jolly listen. The later years are less good, less original, less fun."
4,one of the best socal bands,"of the 90's along with No Knife. Leucadia is a great overview of a sadly overlooked band. Their songs never get staid or played-out and if you can find ""Watercourse"" pick it up as it is an amazing record."
5,Very good,"This is a very good hammock but you better have two people or ten foot arms when assembling, put one end together and the other falls apart but it can be done and a few new cuss words will be invented."
2,Not as shown,The picture of this item shows it with the tote bag. That's why I bought this particular tripod. Was disappointed when it arrived that the tote was not included. I mistake I guess for not reading the fine print.
3,Not memorable,"Great cast. Great performance and production; silly story. But ultimately we have to judge this opera against all operas. As fine as this opera is, it is not memorable and certainly second rate compared to other Verdi operas."
5,Billy Connolly as funny dead as alive!,"Heard of this movie only recently, five years after it was released.Hysteria abounds throughout, and I wish I had a zombie at my place now, as need some irritating locals treated as Fido treats them in this film.Worth the wait, and brilliant viewing!"
5,Great movie,I loved this movie. It was freaking hilarious. If you can find the humor in a zombie named Fido and treated like a house pet who may accidentally eat someone here and there you will love this movie. It was very well made and it is obvious a decent budget was put on this movie.
2,TOO LOUD!!!! -,OK this game has no volume control. So be ready to have your child in the other part of the house. Whoever built this was an idiot and obviously doesn't have children.
2,No volume --- only one setting --- LOUD.,"Although there are a lot of great things about this item, I couldn't get past the fact that we couldn't adjust the volume and it comes with a volume setting we found to be too loud. Bummer --- a volume control could have made it a real winner."
2,I like SIP better,"I picked this up at the library after watching the movie a couple of years ago. I remember liking it OK, so I decided to check this out. It is OK, but zI find enid and Rachel so mean that I can't identify with them: they seem to see the worst in everyone and spend their entire time hurting others. I had a hard time sypathizing with them. I also had a hard time getting into the drawing style; it seemed too.. distant, i suppose. I much prefer Strangers in Paradise, which has something of the same premise (the friendship between to young women), but I identify with Francine and KAtcxhoo more than Enid and Rachel. I would recognize why others might lkike this though."
1,i really dont see a point,i really dont see the point in this reading this nonsense. This is really a waste of time and money.do yourself a favour and read something else with an actual plot
3,Relentless Narcissism,"This is the affectedly vulgar tale of two young women who need some discipline. Those who feel they have the credentials to declare other human beings ""ugly"" will probably see themselves in the main characters and find them hilarious. For those who have grown up, the shtick will wear thin quickly. The art is beautiful and the writing definitely has its moments, but I guess I just can remember actually being a stupid jerk when I was younger and don't look back on those days with much fondness."
4,Very good séries,It's a very good séries !But there is not SUBTITLES What's pity !I love Kate Jackson !Thanks
4,The Rookies - The Complete First Season (1972),I remember this TV program.It was great watching it again.The only thing I was upset about is that they forgot to put the Pilot episode on the first Season.Like Emergency Season 1 & Adam 12 Season 1 they stated the season with the Pilot.As far as Amazon sendind the box collection over seas to Australia. (good work there)Keep up the good work (5 Stars).Sony DVD all I can say is .Anyone who has not seen this program. It is like coming half way through a movie.Sony Pictures (Take a hint from a Movie & TV Collector)(Always start a Season 1 with the Pilot.)(3.5 Stars)
2,excuse 7.95 for a book with a papercover,"don't get me wrong this book has alot of useful facts in it, buts not worth 7.95, and whats with the picture of the elder women, throw live birds in a cauldron, with stuff like that no wonder the christians think we sacrifice."
3,Very Sweet - Good but not Amazing,"I wore this in college and while I think it was probably appropriate then (19-21), it's not so appropriate now (I'm 25).The pros: This perfume is pretty long-lasting. If you spray it once, you should be good until the end of the work day.It's very feminine without going into the weird pink, scented tampon territory that a lot of girly perfumes can get into.I love the bottle. If you display this bottle on your vanity, this bottle can stand up with the best of them. It's super cute.Cons: This perfume is super duper sweet. And because of just how sweet it smells its kind of one-dimensional. The strawberry is a strong note in this one. If I had to describe it in three words or less, I would go with - slightly musky strawberry.Unlike other reviewers I wouldn't describe this one as clean smelling at all - even in the bottle it doesn't come off as ""clean to me"". BIn my opinion, it's not work appropriate. It's pretty distracting ."
2,not what i expected,all the reviews I had read madet this sound like it was a great smeeling cologne. It is very strong and tends to give me and everyone around me a headache.
1,Never received,"I'm writing this reveiw on the company, Discount Ramps, rather than the ramps themselves. They charged my credit card immediately upon ordering, then 6 weeks later when I inquired about where these ramps were, they told me the manufacturer hadn't received the metal to build them yet, and the build time is 4-6 weeks. Just be careful, people."
1,a writer's reference,"i ordered this book at 8/26/2010, but still i did not get it today(09/27/2010). i realy want this book badly."
5,kick A$$,"wonderful album...in and out, Keith and Mick.just buy it...you won't feel bad.btw on the DVD of this special edition release there are 2 new unreleased songs...good stuff."
5,Beautiful Book,We Love this book. The stories are lovely. The art work is amazing. My daughter loves how it shows what will happen next in the little circles on the side of the page. This is a large book but I love having the collection in one place. It makes it a special read together book.
5,Incredible music from an incredible evening...,I LOVE the music of Tim Janis and this CD is a truly wonderful CD. This CD has georgeous live tracks and extra bonus tracks to make it completely full of breathtaking melodies...I would truly recommend it to anyone who wants to have some beautiful music around the house!
2,"""Unoriginal"" Says It All","This is the least original, most disorganized music I've heard in a long time. It goes in one direction for a few seconds, and then makes an abrupt turn and starts to go someplace else; it's like A.D.D. for the ears! I made the mistake of buying this CD at the behest of a friend after hearing only samples of the music, and it was a huge disappointment. I thought it wasn't ""going"" anywhere because the samples online WERE only samples; instead, I find out that what's online is just about all there is, and that the album as a whole is no more cohesive than those samples. It moves me not at all; I wish it DID, but there's no emotion there. Add to that the fact that many themes and passages have CLEARLY been borrowed from John Barry (consciously or unconsciously, I don't know), whose music DOES move me, and this album is a disaster."
3,Who Admits They Are Dysfunctional?,"A cutsey journal geared towards young girls but fun for anyone. It even contains a test to tell just how dysfunctional you really are.This journal has pages of crazy graphics and fonts, places for pictures of people who make you gag, lines to record your lies and mischievousness and many quotes from famously naughty people. A great gift for teenage girls as most of the questions are geared toward their mentality. Adults might find it fun to remember the old glory days as well. Silly and playful and fun for the young at heart."
1,Damaged Goods,I bought this as a gift for my boss for Christmas. Worst decision I ever made. The case for the item was damaged and there were scratches on the helmet which leads me to believe that this was a used item. I paid $30 for an item that I would be imbarrased to give to anything. Thanks!
3,"great scenery, good storyline, poor dialogue","I had a hard time locating this movie on video, but I finally found it. I was appalled by the dialogue. I'm sure Californians don't like being stereotyped in those roles. Overall, it was entertaining with a good ending."
1,Dry,"Way off base. My experience with following the suggestions in this book were rattling. Detail with some opinion (good as well as bad) instead of enormity of listings would be much more valuable.For the price, I'd recommend going to Bay Area Backroads internet site."
1,Maps?,A team must write this book because there is no there there. Clarity is lacking. The author's voice is missing. I wasn't challenged and couldn't get excited about the areas described within.
4,ML - House of M Great for collectors!,This is one wonderful gift pack that beats anything that Hasbro has put out so far in the Marvel Legends franchize. Toy Biz created awesome figures based on awesome comic books and this is a MUST-HAVE for all you collectors out there in Marvel World.
3,"Very safe it seems, but can be querky.","This is a very safe car seat but it does have its querks. First of all it can be difficult to get it to latch into the base. My wife and I had to keep rocking it back and forth to get both sides to latch. We called Britax and they really had no idea what it could be. So I used some WD40 and sprayed it into the latch mechanism inside the car seat and this seemed to help quite a bit. Also, our son hated, and I mean hated the head support that could be inflated. We finally removed it and it was a world of difference in his reaction to being in the seat. It does fasten extremely easy onto the matching stroller. The stroller is great that goes with this seat. So in conclusion, very safe car seat, but it isn't user friendly and does has some idiosyncracies."
2,Not very good...,"This ablum contains too much non-musical sound effects which is even noisy and annoying. So listening to this CD is not comfortable. Furthermore, each track is mostly too short to appreciate. Consequently, avoid this CD if you are not a crazy fan of him."
5,A Masterpiece of Debauchery!,"Unapologetically sick and gloriously wrong, there's something in here to offend and/or delight everyone out there, often simultaneously. Hailing from the burbs of the South Bay (ever see 'The River's Edge'?), with a middle finger pointed firmly at overreaching authority, The Pissing Idiots set out on their mission to drink, smoke, and insult their way into the hearts of America, with a nod and wink to the fiery guitar metal of yore, and succeed in bludgeoning you into being outwardly shocked but secretly charmed, having a punk as f**k great time doing it."
5,Zydeco Stomp,"I am pleased with this compilation of Zydeco music.It's uplifting, entertaining and a joy to listen to.It makes a great gift to lift the spirits of anyone."
3,Could've been much more.,"Don't get me wrong, I love Simon the djinn. I want to know the ritual to summon djinns like him to do the housework. This book, however, could've fun and wonderful if not for the heroine.She is one of those irritatingly too-independent heroine whom you need a crowbar to pry out anything from her. Tight-lipped to the point of not telling her own company partners the company's in trouble (that's irresponsible) I want to shake her silly after a while. She ruined the fun of the story. What was the author thinking?"
3,A quick light read,"I have a long commute to and from work, so I go through books to the tune of 2 to 3 a week. I gravitate to any genre of romance, though I tend to avoid books with glaring covers and big type print. Thus saying, I would like to put in a good word for Kathleen Nance's book Wishes Come True. The story was enjoyable even if I felt the plot was very predictable. I appreciate when writers add a lot of detail to their stories, showing that they have done their research on the book. Though this book is about fantasy, I felt the lack of details, the small touches which make a book a really great read. The characters are ""friendly"" and I enjoyed watching the interference of the secondary characters as the story unfolded."
5,A dream...,"Liane's notebooks are beyond charming -- she carps about the quality of her dresses from Poiret on one day, reads the ""Imitation of Christ"" the next, disses Collette rather harshly, and pleads with God to reveal himself to her. Her contradictions are marvelous, she's funny and fearless in her way. I adore this book, and am on my second reading of it."
5,Like no other,"This concert is really like no other concert. The creativity, fun, scenario, dances, everything is amazing. Pink was for me a good artist, but after seeing this she is an entertainer like very very few....she kept singing like nothing was happening WHILE she was doing acrobatics!Concert AAA++++++++++++Pink AAA+++++++++++++Recomend this concert 100%"
5,amazing,One amazing Video she it a total entertainer! and writes amazing songs her songs are always well put together She is amazing! as always
3,Tuckeys Home,I thought Tuckets Home. The book Tuckets home was different because it was like an adventure because you are going through a desert and not knowig what wii happen next. And not knowing if any body will get hurt or die.I think the author did a good job at the end of the book. I think the best part was at the end because you are going through the last desert and nobody has got hurt or injuryed so far. And I was surprised nobody got hurt cause someone was after Francis.The characters in the book really looked out for each other and helped each other. When they thought they could not go any more. Also the setting was different. Because it was in the desert and it was still adventure.
2,Sigh....We all get old.,"I bought this CD/DVD collection based on some good reviews I saw here and elsewhere, having been a huge Poco fan back in the '70s and early '80s. I have no problem with a bald Rusty Young and a fat Paul Cotton...what I have a problem with is the acute lack of energy in the performance. The recent release by Poco of their ""Indian Summer"" tour DVD shows the sharp contrast of a band at its musical peak and one that is marking time until the end. The only moments of life come when Richie Furay comes out to play some dated but fun material (i.e. ""Let's Dance"") The rest of the disc is dominated by slow ballad type numbers that miss what a Poco concert was all about. It's fun and nostalgic to see the guys out there playing, but buy the '70s concert disc. There is no comparison in the quality of the performance."
1,THEIR CATALOGUE IS A DISASTER,I LOVE THE STONES BUT THERE ARE TOO MANY OF THE SAME SONGS ON MANY OF THEIR ALBUMS. WHY DON'T THEY JUST COME OUT WITH A TRUE B-SIDE COLLECTION INSTEAD OF THIS SAD EXCUSE FOR A RARITIES. WHEN I LOOKED AT THE TRACK LISTING IT WAS PATHETIC. DO YOU REALLY NEED A REMIXED VERSION OF MISS YOU? THEY COULD HAVE DONE BETTER.
2,Come On,"Hey Mick and Keith, open your vaults and release some REAL rarities. Almost all of this is available from previous releases. Come on guys. We know you have enough in the can to fill twenty 30 gig iPods. Let's be more adventuresome. Go with the Dylan formula of releasing boxes and boxes of bootlegs. They'll sell. Don't worry."
2,Rarities? With 3 exceptions they aren't.,"This is a missed opportunity.With the exception of the previously unreleased live version of ""Tumbling Dice"" and two previously vinyl-only tracks(""Let it Rock"" & ""Through The Lonely Nights""),there is nothing else on this CD that is remotely rare;just a re-hash of tracks from ""Flashpoint + Collectibles"",""Sucking in the 70's"",""Love You Live"",""Stripped"",""Another Side of Steel Wheels"" and several UK CD singles.A major letdown,since there are still many vinyl-only Stones tracks from the past 35 years.Such a Lazy compiling effort."
1,no surprise,"is anyone truly surprised that the Stones would release a piece of dung such as this? They've been doing it for years; look at FLOWERS, for Pete's sake. The Rolling Stones have plenty of rabid fans who would gladly empty their pockets for a bootleg box set, ala Dylan, so if greed is their motivation at this point, please, fellows, exercise some quality control!"
5,PEGS for old Cribbage Boards,These pegs were just what we needed to re-gift some old cribbage boards that we had sanded down and refinished. They were affordable and have been durable.
4,Lasgo. Great first album.,I really likes the first album except for a few tracks at the end. Well worth buying. The second album is even better.
2,Starts off great...,"I wanted to get this CD after I first heard Lasgo's song ""Blue"" on the radio. It took me a long time until I actually got it, but when I did I listened to it nonstop. The songs are all moving, there are great beats, and the vocals are beautiful.But then a few weeks passed, and I could no longer help but notice how every song on this CD has the same one or two sounds in them, and after I realized this it became a lot harder to enjoy listening to it.It's been a while since I put this CD away, and I recently picked it back up and now I listen to it every now and then. But every day? I get bored after only an hour."
3,Good album,This album is good even if all songs almost sounds the same. The singer is okay but she can't hit those high notes very well. More singing lessons for you girl.
1,Stay away,"Doorknobs will only turn in one direction and are wobbly. Low cost item, and it definitely shows. Installed it, then removed it an hour later. Don't waste your money."
2,Save your money,Not very funny. Can't anybody write a decent book for men on the subject of weddings?
1,Such a waste,This book is waste..didn't have so many topics which was in the exam..please don't buy it..waste of money waste of time..
1,skip this product,"It lasted four years. Then the hose spout broke off with a simple tug of the hose. Now there's just a flat open hole in the side where the hose should connect.During its short life, the hose repeatedly fell off the spout despite all efforts to tighten the cheap radiator hose style screw clamp. Hose falling off means dumping out all the stored water. Not a pleasant experience.The flimsy overflow hose died of sun exposure a few years ago despite the fact that the barrel is mostly shaded throughout the day.What a ripoff."
5,simple perfection,"This book is the perfect- even mandatory- companion gift to anyone's first rifle, even a bb gun.Cooper was the lead instructor for Gunsite, and one of the world's most knowledgeable riflemen. He is also a fine writer with a stripped down style, and this book is a powerfully simple introduction to effectively using a long arm, for hunting , targets, battle, whatever.This book is the perfect gift for any serious shooter. I have bought a dozen copies over the years as gifts for new gun owners and young relatives coming into the world of hunting and shooting. Nobody has ever done it better, and the book is a kind of heirloom, a touchstone for real real shooters of every generation. I cannot recommend it highly enough, obviously.Hal Herringauthor of:Famous Firearms of the Old West: From Wild Bill Hickok's Colt Revolvers to Geronimo's Winchester, Twelve Guns That Shaped Our History]]"
4,This a a good book but...,"I think this is a good ""hot to"" book, but honestly, I would have expected a little more from it... especially for the price.I would recommend this book to new comers. Unless you are searching for a reference book, you should spend your money elsewhere if you are already involved in shooting."
3,The Art Of The Rifle: Special Color Edtion,"Very Uniformative.I'm new to rifle ownership but I didn't feel that there was much useful information in this book. I felt, and I think a number of other reviews confirm this for me, that this book is no more than a way for this old guy to make a couple of bucks for his retirement. I'm not trying to be mean but I just don't feel that I got my money's worth. I felt that the book was just a platform for an old guy to talk about how great the good old days were and what a sad place it is now. It was extremely short on subject matter and long on opinion. I was very disappointed especially given the high cost of this small book. I will not be buying anything else from this author!Reggie"
2,just okay,"I bought the map thinking it would help out greatly on our trip to the Cayman Islands. After looking at it, I just noticed that I had the main roads listed. When we arrived at the airport, I picked up one of the activity guides. Their map was a LOT better than the map I had purchased for the trip. For me, it was a waste of money. The activity guide one showed were restaurants were and places to visit. This map only listed the street names and where some of the resorts were located. Not helpful at all."
2,That's the WRONG JOHN on the COVER!,"What kind of slipshod, moronic research could confuse the great, iconic John Adams with his less-iconic son John Quincy? They don't even look a little alike -- John Quincy favors his mom which might have been obvious to anyone who looked at the cover. So much for ""Biography""."
4,kristofferson,"This is a rebuy on my part, I've apparently lost the original.I'm not a country/western fan, but Kris's lyrics knock me out."
2,Too Short,"I thought that it would be longer and had a couple 25 minute episodes like the And1 mix tape tour seasons 1 and 2. Instead, its only a 45 minute movie like dvd. I was disappointed."
5,Outstanding story of early Navajo trading posts.,"This book was written by a man who was both a prolific writer of Westerns and operator of a series of Trading posts on the Navajo Reservation. It is an outstanding autobiographical picture of life as a trader in the early 1900's, filled with mundane and fantastic personal experiences.Highly readable and exciting, ""Navajo Trader"" brings the early trading post experience to vivid life."
1,Not Impressed,this cartoon compiliation sound good but they end up a big dissapointmentI didnt really like it but it didnt cost allot either
1,false advertising,"NOWHERE IN THE DESCRIPTION DID IT SAY THAT THESE WERE THE PLAYS. I LOVE ALL OF TYLER PERRYS MOVIES BUT I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED WHEN I HAD GONE TO WATCH THEM AND CAME TO THE REALIZATION THAT THEY WERE NOT THE MOVIES, BUT THE PLAYS."
5,pirate puzzle,My 3 year old loves this puzzle. The box has a cool shape and the pieces are nice and big for small hands.The graphic is really cute too. We also own the knight and dragon puzzle from the same company.
5,One of the Best UFC videos,"UFC I was one the the best videos you can get in the UFC series. The Rosier/Frazier fight is an absolute slugfest, and the Gracie/Shamrock fight was good as well. Gordeau made some good performances, but we never see from him again. The only bad parts were the horridible announcing (Wallace sais ""pain hurts"", what a no-brainer!) and the equally bad referree is nothing compared to Big John McCarthy. Great fights, though."
2,"Only useful as a nursery, too small for adult fish","Adult fish should never be kept in an ""aquarium"" this small and it should not be marketed for them. Goldfish need a MINIMUM of 5 gallons each, and bettas as well. This could be useful as a nursery for fry if the filter doesn't suck them up."
5,Genuine Outback Trading Company Drover Coat,"I spend a lot of time outdoors. When it comes to being prepared for the worst weather, nothing beats a Drover coat. The Outback Trading Company oilskin drover can handle the heaviest rain, gusty winds, or snow and ice. Mine has the cotton lining and the shoulder-cape. I have already put this coat to the test and it kept me warm and dry.One thing about wearing a genuine drover coat, you'll turn a lot of heads. People typically see then in movies, like ""The Man From Snowy River"" or old westerns. I get lots of questions and compliments."
5,Great fragrance for a little price.,"This scent is awesome. So many people ask me what I am wearing, and are very surpised to find it costs so little.I have been wearing it for about 8 years now and I never get tired of it."
5,We both like it,"First, a warning--> The product picture is of a different, and unknown to me, product, Fire and Ice Cool. Just be aware of the difference. The description is of the regular version, which is what I ordered and received.My wife understands subtle. As in- when she puts on make-up, it doesn't look like she's put on make-up. You don't smell her 50 feet away when she's wearing perfume. (Sorry if that offended any women, but really...)She loves this and has worn it for years. I like it on her. It's become our long time Christmas tradition for her to get this as a stocking stuffer (Sur-PRISE)."
3,Disney's Little Einsteins,The game is okay for little ones. My son has enjoyed it and that is what matters.
2,Critical parts are flimsy plastic!!!,"This rod works but it wall base plate attachment is plastic, only the top or bottom of the end covers snap on the base plate but not both, and limited wall anchor choices. Many modern houses utilize advanced framing techniques that use 5/8"" sheetrock on the 2x6 exterior walls. The anchors (molly bolts) are minimally expectable for 1/2"" sheetrock but do not work on 5/8"". I don't think this will last that well as the shower curtain is tugged on over time. Its consumer grade junk!"
5,Perfect fit & finished look,"I looked all over locally for these fixed-length curved shower rods, and couldn't find them anywhere! The only thing anyone stocked was the adjustable rods. I prefer the fixed length because my curtain rings don't get hung up on the ""lip"" created by the adjustable rod, and it simply looks nicer and more professional. I was thrilled to find them at such a great price on Amazon. I ordered two of these, and they installed like a dream! I saw one reviewer comment that they were unhappy because ""no shower is exactly 60"" wide."" Ours installed with absolultely no issues, and the brackets do allow for a total of 1"" variance, which is adequate in most circumstances. The rods also arrived within a week, which was fantastic, and helped our remodel move along faster. The finishes are beautiful, and my two updated baths look amazing. This is the only way to go for a shower rod!"
5,Great Looking Rod,"This is a great looking rod! I did not know how pretty it looks until I finished the installation! The material and the shape really adds beauty to the bathroom.The installation maye take you a while if you have a stoned shower wall. I had travertine, and the installation took me about an hour. Drilling the 6 holes on the two walls (3 holes each) took the most time. You would need to get a 3/16"" masonary drill, anchor, stainless screw.Advice: before you drill on the wall, put a masking tape on the wall. Otherwise the drill bit will slide on the wall. Use 3/16"" drill bit and size #10 anchor. The anchor needs to be exact size #10, too small will not grab, too large will not stay. Use stainless screws otherwise they will rust over time."
1,Disappointed,"I wish there was a 0 star rating. Carob is a healthy alternative to chocolate and that's why I ordered this item. However, when I received the carob chips today, I read the ingredients before opening the package and was GREATLY disappointed to find that they are made with PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED palm kernal oil!!! TRANS FAT!!!! So much for being healthy. I am going to try sending them back."
5,Hard to Find 45's on CD.,"This is almost aws good as the original. Well, actually better. I gotta have the complete set."
4,descriptive,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and the descriptive way the author wrote. I have been through Colorado and have seen the beauty she described. Also enjoyed the story because there wasn't a lot of violence and if there was any sex, it was only in our imagination which is the greatest kind. I was amazed at how the lady rode for miles in rugged wilderness without seeming to get lost. The fact that she could subsist on meager food was also interesting."
3,Lady's Life in Rocky Mtns.,A Lady's life in the Rocky Mountains is the title. This is a fairly good book..read others by same author. word should not be required!!
5,very good review,"This book arrived in top condition and in time. In a college book store this book cost a lot more, so I am very pleased to be able to buy it from this seller."
2,Not impressed with this book,"My first impressions of this book is that it is hastily put together both in printing and content. On my copy, the print quality is poor.One of the most important devices in a good handbook is the index. The index of this book is sparse to say the least, with most of the built in functions and triggers not directly indexed at all, so that you have to trawl through the book sequentially to find the things you are looking for.On the my first reference to a built in function, I found a glaring error. The very first page I looked at contained an obvious contradiction. I have not yet had enough exposure to the rest of the book to say if that error is out of character, though I would hope it is.I would say that as it has its place as a book to aid learning, but falls a long way short when used as a reference to an experienced forms developer."
2,Not very impressive,"I am a beginner in Oracle Forms and Reports. I bought this book as a supplement to the class I am taking. The book talks about companion software, but there is no CD. It turned out to be downloadable SQL/PL*SQL scripts to be installed in my environment (You must have Oracle Developer client, not Windows environment, installed on your pc with permissions to create databases and tables, etc.) and run those scripts to setup the databases and tables. Very limited index doesn't help any more than my teacher, who puts up a Powerpoint presentation in the class and basically reads through each slide without much of an explanation for anything.I may return this book if I find a better book."
4,Good overview,"This was a very good overview of the life of Julia Child, from birth to recent years, in less than an hour. Through interviews with family, friends and Julia herself, it was honest, informative, candid and at times, very humorous. Highlights of her background growing up, her schooling, her wonderful marriage to Paul Child, her forward thinking in that particular age, her comprehensive cookbooks and her critical involvement in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) (a United States intelligence agency formed during World War II), among other things, provided an opportunity to learn more about the charming, intelligent chef and her unsurpassed-to-this-day cooking show on television."
4,Kate Hepburn Biography,"Very good synopsis of Kathrine Hepburn's life and career, but is not updated to her death in June of 2003. The DVD is a bit short, but still informing."
3,You're probably better off with volumes 2 and 3,"If you're an absolutely new to rainwater harvesting book, this book may be of some use. But if you understand the basic ideas of rainwater harvesting, I'd skip this book.Perhaps volumes 2 and 3 are more specific. Volume 1 tells you about the meat, but doesn't give it to you. I suspect the meat (i.e. useful detailed information) is in volumes 2 and 3.You may prefer Art Ludwig's the New Create an Oasis with Greywater. I found it had the same basic information on rainwater harvesting as Volume 1, but in addition, has detailed information on creating a greywater system."
1,"Poorly made, and is broken after a week.","We bought this at Petco a week ago, and at first I thought it was okay, the ball wheel, seemed quiet, and a fun idea, but within a day a connection snapped off, but it still worked fine. Around day five the ball wheel became excessively noisy, but I was able to adjust the ball connection so it was quiet. But now, day seven, the ball is SUPER noisy, and you know these little guys like to run at night...I can't seem to quiet it. I'm not sure if this item can be return either. Personally, I wouldn't buy it again, i would look for something more sturdy, and with a separate ball, and a regular wheel."
2,Good cage but can be easy for hamster escape,This was a great cage for the first few weeks. The tower was a great place for our hamster to make a nest and for us to watch her. However our hamster was able to easily push the lid off and escape.
1,Disappointed!!,"Informatively, I have Mason's DVD's, which I quite enjoy.However, this CD, labelled, ""BRAND NEW,"" contains many repeats andsituations. In fact, at times I was ahead of Jackie Mason, mouthing word for word the joke and situation he was leading up to me.Mason spoke as if he was rushing to meet a deadline, to the extent that much of the CD sounded like gibberish. For most of this CD I sat stone faced and suspected that perhaps the applause and clapping of hands were canned.Mason, in my opinion, went overboard in his use of obscenities,loudly and in his asides,seemingly contrived for shock value.As for me, I think that this mislabelled, ""BRAND NEW,"" CD was aflop, and I would not care to have it in my collection for fearof the impression I would leave after my demise.So, another item destined for my shredder.Finally, I would recommend the Mason DVD's, which I would have preferred with a slower delivery and less obscenities that addlittle to his performance.Robert LyonsReno, Nevada"
2,"A biased, poorly written book.","A biased, poorly written book, Louis L. Snyder should have left this book on the back burner. Often attempting to sensationalize his work, the author's one word statements of shock and indignation seem to indicate a poor attempt at a newspaper article as opposed to a piece of historical work. A below average piece of material, certainly not crowded with historical fact, this book is better left on the shelf to collect dust."
5,Worked like a charm,Scosche always has the right parts for me when I need to install a new car stereo. It worked great
4,Inspirational,"Now I know what women can do, and it's great. These women seem just like me and yet they did this extraordinary thing. They're probably mad, but good on them."
5,A must read for business owners,"This is one of the best books I read on this topic. You want to make millions more? It's simple: read Andy's book, and keep his advice."
1,"Poor quality, guaranteed to fail","Bought one of these on amazon.com last week. First time we used it, it deflated slightly after about 3 times down a short hill. Second time, if sprung a leak and deflated completely after 4 runs down a 100-yard hill. Construction is cheap, as are the materials. There is no way these snow tubes will last more than a couple times out without failing- simply because the material and construction is too cheap to last.If you want a a snow tube that is built to last, look for one with a hard plastic bottom and much thicker material on top. They are a lot more expensive, but I see now that if you want a snow tube that will last, this is the only alternative."
3,neat toy but too loud.,"This toy has lots to keep kids busy, I only wish there was a switch to adjust the volume(music is very loud) and an on/off switch. Other than that, the weebles are very durable and my 2yr old enjoys playing with the tree house and sending both weebles and anything else that will fit down the slide."
3,Dark Fantasy master stumbles with this one,"Charles Grant usually writes excellent gothic type thrillers, but this it not one of them. Two weakly connected stories come together. The first about a struggling American teacher turned writer living in England dealing with a friend who has both gone mad and apparently gained the ability to cause horrible accidents or death with a simple touch, the second about a click of his former students back home (in New England of course) getting ready to pull the usual 'stunts' (aka pranks) on Halloween night. While sporting Grant's keen eye for atmosphere and undstanding of character, the tale just did not come together for me. A disappointment."
2,BOC,"I deffinately ordered the wrong one, wish the site had play or read songs that are on the CDs.But thanks."
2,How did they ever get away with some of these?,"Stairway to the Stars? This album is okay, but when have such a terrible song that you have to skip it every time the album is ruined.Here's a sample of the lyrics:You can have my autographI think I'll sign it love to youBut should I sign it just for youStairway to the stars, I think I'll write good health to youStairway to the stars, we got better things to doYou can drive my motorcarIt's insured to thirty thouKill them all if you wishStairway to the stars, I think I'll write good health to youStairway to the stars, we got better things to doYou can have my autographI think I'll sign it good health to youUpon the cast, your broken armStairway to the stars, I think I'll write good health to youStairway to the stars, I hope you heal up real quickStairway to the stars...Come on, let's get on outa here."
2,"Not worth the money, gets old very fast","Our 3 year old wouldn't leave the store without this, so we gave in since it looked like a good educational, and fun program. Unfortunately, once you have played the game once (which takes all of 20 minutes)you have pretty much exhausted it for entertainment value. Oh sure, you can change the level to increase the difficulty but it really doesn't alter the game play, it just adds a few more items to each ""puzzle"". Although from the packaging we had high hopes for this game, we ended up being extremely disappointed."
1,"Not fun, not worth the money","My daughter liked this game the first time she played it, but half way through the second time, she was bored. Each time you play, you go through the same set of games, in the same order, with the same outcome. Nothing is ever different from the time before, and it doesn't take very long. There is also not much educational value. This is not worth the money at all. If you want Dora games, there are plenty of them at Nickjr.com."
1,A waste of money....,"This game was a gift for my 3 year old. When we installed it, the sound was so choppy, we couldn't play the game. I tried all the troubleshooting suggestions, with no luck. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling and my entire system crashed. Needless to say, we have not attempted Dora again. After reading these reviews, I think I will call tech support and ask for a refund, rather than a replacement, as another reviewer suggested. What a waste and a disappointment."
3,Decent dive knife but rusted quickly,Very sharp knife but started rusting after first dive even with excellent after each dive
4,Think about it,This is a good album. I first heard their music at a concert with Jewel. I found that they had a broad spectrum of styles that they were capable of doing well. They did a set of 4 songs and they each had a different style. The styles of Think of England range from the Blues to Jazz to Pop and to easy listening. They are a great group and they will have something that all are sure to love.
3,OK - but not up to Mitford,"I enjoyed the first novel in this series but not so much the following. It is entertaining but does not have the same level of belivability as the Mitford series does. At times i felt like I was being ""preached to"" - by a pastor that I do not have a lot of respect for."
1,Too Bulky,The T-Mobile MDA is already big enough. This product makes it even bigger. It's like carrying around a bulky cordless phone
1,Quality of product Questionable,"The Case is too bulky, once you get use to it, it is OK. The clip is weak, but would work."
3,A true queen of blue-eyed soul,"I would give this album five stars, but it doesnt have Deja Vu or Square Biz in it. I am waiting impatiently for Teena Marie's comeback. WHERE ARE YOU, WOMAN???"
5,What is to be said about a wonderful artist,A beautiful voice that was never trully appreciated and she left us at a early age. This music is excellent and to be enjoyed by many. If given as a gift means you think highly of the recipent.
1,Go with Karma Part 2 (enhanced),I ordered Karma 1 & 2 (enhanced) hoping there would be different versions of the Diary remix. Both have the same copy.
5,Mother Effing Zebrahead Female Dogs,Zebrahead does it again... They've returned with an amazing album.. a different sound... and hard hitting lyrics... this is definately the CD of the year.
1,skip this one,My son is also an avid Thomas Fan and we bought this since he had played the Great Festival Game several times. We run Windows XP and couldn't get the game to load properly. When we finally got into the game there wasn't much to do. The Great Festival Game is a much better deal.
4,It's Interesting,"I have purchased practically all of Sloane's books. I love the era about which he writes. This is another great book of his. If you liked any of his other works, you will like this one."
5,Fascinating Topic,"The topic of this book is fascinating and seemingly overlooked in anthropological studies. After reading Mr. Pickenpaugh's book, it is so obvious that his research, which must have consisted of years not months, proves his points. His book enlightens the reader about headmen, chiefs, kings and emperors from the Pacific Islands, sub-Saharan Africa and lowland South America who wear necklaces of large canines from the most powerful and ferocious animals in their respective environments. One can see this book being THE basis for future research, or for class studies/required reading at any respectable university. Lastly, upon completion of the book, one looks at these various cultures with a new respectful eye, which is the art of a good anthropologist."
5,A great product,We use carob chips in place of chocolate in many recipes. This is a high quality product and I am glad to have a new source for this chocolate/sugar alternative.
2,maybe alright for baking but must have high trans fat content,"I ordered this product in hope of obtaining a good chocolate substitute for my toddler to snack on. Unfortunately, beside a lot of sugar these chips are loaded with saturated fats - almost certainly with plenty of trans fats since the oils are listed as being partially-hydrogenated [trans fat content not described on label]. Taste-wise these chips are too sweet for my liking but at least have the basic carob flavor that I remember from chips available in the stores back in the 80s and 90s - albeit a purer carob with less fat content would be most welcomed."
1,Pure Fat and Sugar,These taste like pure sugar and fat. It's literally crystallized sugar whipped up with some palm oil. Does not even taste remotely like carob or chocolate. So disgusting.
3,Hothand,"Well as sequels go this was not bad. A new guy playing the Hornet but he pulled it off pretty well. It was a continuation of the first thrilling saga of "" The Urban Robin Hood."""
4,the best live video footage,"What you have here are both of the Budokan, Tokyo concerts on CD from 1966 ...I preferred the first performance...the second lacks definition and is weak in output....altho both shows find the band singing and playing weak..as compared to their earlier days....This pair of shows were heavily affected by the smoking of marijuana before gigs....a very big thanks to Bob Dylan for that contribution....He probably killed the biggest band of the century.The video quality of the DVD is great....here you get to see the band in color and crystal clear....and it even brings to light their mistakes onstage...as well as their classic Beatle sense of humour.For the completist...this is a must...but if you dont want to have your memories of The Beatles tarnished by sloppy performances and obvious drug effects onstage.....better forget this one."
4,reaches to depict torture with imagination and originality,"Before reading Senseless I didnt have any idea of the plot. The book grips you, and especially in the second half.There are many creepy twisted books out there, but this one appealed to me, not b/c it was especially creepy, but because of the simplicity, yet, extreme imagination of the story.Gast (main character) brings you into his world of a new form of torture brought into the world...stealing from him what we all take for granted EVERY DAY. Thus the vivid descriptions let your mind explore the idea of ""what if I were in that position?""Its a great idea for a story and I loved how it was explained."
1,Beware,"BEWARE, THIS BOOK MAY BE DANGEROUS TO YOUR HEALTH, you may die of boredom. A plausable indroduction, but after that totally downhill. Way too may characters and way too many subplots for the average reader with a really boring murder mystery to begin with. Avoid this book at all costs. 76 per cent through, I put it in the trash."
3,"I couldn't put it down, but towards the end I wish I did","The book starts off with a bunch of unnecessary background regarding Wyatt's CPA experience. However, as soon as the Judge and mistress are murdered, the book literally takes off and it leads you through twists and turns that are unexpected. I got through this section in a matter of a coule hours and I was so excited to find out who was behind all of the mayhem that was occuring. However, in the last hundred pages, too much emphasis on the vineyard part lost my interest and in the end, the motives and plots to uncover the motives get lazy, and I can tell the writer just gives up.It's a good read for an airplane, like others have said, but the beginning and end leave a lot to be desired."
4,spy thriller,Nuclear material on a sunken ship; a spy left for dead floating in the Atlantic; an American sailing alone across the Atlantic. These ingrediants come together for a good spy novel.
3,It's Not Perfect,"The Perfects Assassin held my interest, but there were times it was too wordy, and not clear. The first part was exciting, and then it got bogged down for me. The ending was predictable."
1,Unlikable characters and boring plot.,I dragged myself through this novel. The characters are one dimensional and unlikable. The plot is tedious. The prose is laboured.
5,Full of suspense an easy read,"If you are into ""sniper"" type books, you'll really enjoy this. I think I read this is 2 to 3 days, hard to put down."
3,a good try but not a good book,"I wanted to like this book, but I didnt. The beginning was promising, but copied from Bourne books.As i read on it became clear that is a mix of much better book,And there is no real ""bad"" guy, it was fairly unclear who was being fought.I am not going to talk about all the plot holes, really big enough to drive a train through.i will give 3 stars but in reality it would have been a 2 1/2 stars"
2,Entertaining read,"very nice read, some predictable parts but engaging while offering a good emotional pull. enjoyed the overall story and the characters as well. missed other killers on the trail during the development of his expertise. thanks good book worth the read."
3,The Perfect Assassin,"Not to bad a read. The concept wasn't bad and the characterizations weren't to bad. A few to many people in the book, but all in all time not wasted."
4,A good read,"This book had a good plot and was well written. There were many twists and turns in the story that kept it interesting. The characters were developed adequately, especially the doctor. I would recommend this book for a good weekend diversion."
2,HAUNTED BOAT,"""Haunted boat"" is a joke. When you read the plot it seems like it has potenial, but you see nothing in the movie. They add so much random crap, the ending makes no sense. The bad part is, you keep watching the movie expecting it to get better, or to even see anything that was remotely described in the ""reviews"". If you're seeing this movie for the horror, you'll be dissapointed. If you're seeing this movie for the plot, you'll be dissapointed. If you're seeing this movie for any other reason than to waste an hour and a half it's not worth it."
1,Haunted Boat tries to be inventive but fails,"""Haunted Boat"" started out as your average low budget teen horror movie, about a group of teens get stuck in a boat. But pretty soon it departs from the formula. Unfortunately, it's not in a good way. For a long part of the movie, they sit around telling stories that don't add anything to the plot. Some new characters are thrown in and strange things happen with no apparent logic and the end makes no sense. Perhaps if I'd watch it again things would fall into place, but ""Haunted Boat"" isn't good enough to watch more than once. And it's hardly worth watching even once. There are many much better movies out there. Not recommended."
1,98 minutes of my life I'll never get back...,"I love cheesy horror movies. I've seen hundreds of them. Many are good, many are passable. Most at least have one redeeming feature. Not this one. This is one of the worst pieces of garbage I've ever had the misfortune to suffer through. As previous reviewers have mentioned, the ending made no sense. Unfortunately, most of the movie made no sense as well. Characters would appear and disappear for no reason; people told pointless ghost stories to pad the run time of the movie; somebody puked up weird insect things... I have been slowly trying to plow through my collection of 3,000 movies, and most of the time when they are this bad I've been turning them off. I just kept expecting more from this. The Lionsgate name usually means that at least some quality. Not this time. Stay away at all costs!!=Matt"
1,Haunted Boat? Huh?,"This movie is obviously low-budget, but does have some creepy parts. Unforunately, the plot takes the viewer off on so many tangents, the end leaves you scratching your head for the sense of it all?"
4,"kool, i guess","I'll give this a 4 for the heck of it, i really dont know much about kriss kross, hey, im only 14! i didnt even hear about them till like last yr or 2 or something and didnt hear a song till I came here, from what i heard its pretty good, but i dont think anyone likes em anymore! lil boys in da hood is good, and so is jump."
1,1 star for one hit wonders,"""Jump"" is their only good song. The rest of this album is horrible. Little kids rapping really isn't fresh at all. In fact, it's downright annoying. If this is in the bargain bin for $2.00, then pick it up, otherwise, forget about it."
1,Very Expensive Paper Weight,"Oh, what high hopes I had for this. I had many good experiences with GermGuardian plug-ins and they work tirelessly and endlessly. This product which is many times the price is worthless. The bulb, as many others have stated, burned out in exactly one month -- almost to the day! Interesting, the 'limited warranty' includes everything except the bulb. My close friend and neighbor also bought one on my enthusiastic recommendation.I am not about to pull apart a product containing mercury just to replace a bulb which may burn out in due course.Avoid this very poorly thought-out product.I feel duped, ripped off, and taken to the cleaners!Out it goes/ Money hard-earned, down the toilet.Thanks QA @ GermGuardian."
1,Not Worth The Money,"These tips are terrible. Bought 4 sets to put on new card chairs for bunco group. Used one time on carpeted floor, 3 already split - Terrible! Will not buy these again. Pay a little more $$ and get the heavier type."
3,The Night the Mountain Fell,"The book was not quite what I expected. I expected more historical stories of Eastern Washington while the book only had a few. About half was more 1950's history which I am not interested in. It did give good directions to where ""the mountain fell"" and other places of interest."
3,Not for the uninitiated,"I am not accustomed to vegetarian cooking, but I would like to do more of it. That's why I got this cookbook. I do not think this a great book for ""starter"" vegetarians-- the flavors are often quite unusual. The first thing I made was the Chili with chocolate. It tasted so terrible that I am embarassed to say that I threw out the whole pot. Maybe next time I will stumble upon a book that will appeal to my less sophisticated palette.That being said, the book is extremely well organized with lots of useful party-planning tips."
3,Delivers what it promises,"Dunno, I'm a big Cheap Trick fan and can't deny that GREATEST HITS delivers what it promises. As much as I like the band, it's my opinion that most of Cheap Trick's hits isn't among their best songs. For example, ""Tonight It's You"" is my least favorite tune from their dynamite album STANDING ON THE EDGE, yet it was a hit single. If all you want is the top forty music, pick up Cheap Trick's GREATEST HITS. For those willing to listen more, try Cheap Trick's box set SEX AMERICA. The four CD set includes all but maybe two of the GREATEST HITS selections and serves up a lot more of Cheap Trick at its best."
3,Too many omissions to make this a true Greatest Hits package,"I wonder who compiled this set? A ""one song per CD"" focus seems to be in place making this a sampler not a Greatest Hits collection. Some good songs but the missing ones (ELO Kiddies, Southern Girls, Day Tripper, etc.) makes this far from what the title promises. For someone who might want to get an idea of this band's range but not for the true fan."
4,Room for more,"My only critism of this cd is the omission of a few songs. There's room for some more here.I like the version of Magical Mystery Tour. Southern Girls is lacking as is It's Only Love (I know it wasn't a hit) and something from All Shook Up and Cheap Trick would have comepleted the collection nicely. I guess it's a Greatest Hits so their Greatest Hits are on here.If you're in the market, go for Essential Cheap Trick or Authorised Greatest Hits."
3,Go for the upgrade,"This is an ok collection of Cheap Trick material, but the remaster sports a live version of ""Clock Strikes Ten,"" and bumps the awful remake of ""Magical Mystery Tour"" to the final slot where you can ignore it completely. If it weren't for the fact that the studio version of ""The Flame"" is here over the live version on ""Authorized Greatest Hits,"" you could skip them both."
2,Not impressed,"Activities are slow. Everytime you move from one screen to another, a ""loading"" screen appears for about 15 seconds. There are no verbal instructions which tell the user how to move from one store to another. I had to call the help line. In the ""Library"" it asks the user to put away the books on the bookshelf. The book names are letters (like M). There is an ""M"" on the bookshelf. When the user clicks on the book and puts it away on the shelf where the ""M"" is located, the character on the screen never says that it is the letter ""M"".I think the software could have been much better written."
4,LOVE IT!! LOVE IT!,Gr8 software. Both of my sons(41/2 & 3)love it. Lots of activites so keeps their attention.
4,Enjoyable game,"I like this game because it has very fun features. It makes kids feel special because they can enter their favorite colors and things and then hear about them throughout the game. The characters in the game remember the child's favorite color and initial. Kids also work towards a goal which is a mural that contains all the things they have collected through the game. The games are actually just right for the age group. If it's too easy, they can skip ahead to a more difficult level. All of the characters that kids love from the show appear in the game. Very good graphics."
4,SCI always great live,Any time I here String Cheese jammin' I just want to get up and dance. Glad they are doing stuff again
2,Have to Agree--Unfortunate,"For those of us just diagnosed and searching for detailed information about ""softer"" forms of bipolar, this book is discouraging. If you can get past the typographical errors (I couldn't--geez, mister, at least get a proofreader if not an editor!), there's still not much ""hard"" information. There are some ""case histories,"" but there are no studies to back up this guy's conclusions (he refers to ""my experience"" a lot). It's just not good enough.There are a lot of references to ""helpful"" web sites, but did we really need to spend extra money to figure out we can use the web?I found the information that IS there disorganized and unenlightening. I should have known that an author who begins, ""I love working with bipolars..."" might be a bit of a goof.Save your money and buy ""Why Am I Still Depressed?"" It's much better."
5,Pajama Sam rules,"My children have loved Pajama Sam for years. They're now 7,8, and 10 and they're still interested in getting the latest versions. Pajama Sam proves that kids can enjoy games without guns and violence. He's cute, he's hip, and he's funny. My favorite thing about this game is that it all takes place inside Pajama Sam's closet, and it's a mess - dirty socks and all."
4,Not as great as his appearances on Fox News,I liked this book alot. Dick Morris is probably the best political commentator on Fox News - therefore the best on TV. His opinions and ideas are usually right on the mark.I did feel that he tended to hammer his points a little too much in this book. Do we really need 50 pages to convince us that the NY Times is pushing its liberal dogma to the masses? I don't think so.I would have liked to read more of his thoughts on what I feel is the biggest threat to the American political system - Hilary Clinton.
1,Not a page turner,"The story started out interesting. A young woman heads out with a friend, leaves with a stranger and goes missing. However, I couldn't get past all the cop narrative. While I think it's important to get to know who's on the case, I don't want to read page after page about what the cops are thinking or feeling. I want to know more about Amy and what happened to her. I also found it odd the cop on the case said he had to look into Amy's mother's ""beautiful eyes"". What's that about? I don't care anything about her mother's eyes. Stick to the facts and just tell me about Amy, the killer, and what happened. Sorry, as far as true crime goes this one's a snoozefest."
1,Not a modulator,"I bought this because it says modulator and that is what I expected and needed. It is a transmitter NOT a modulator. If you are looking for a modulator do not buy this, it is mislabeled/misadvertised."
3,bright led light,this light is bright than the one I got at Home Depot but it is much lighter so it may not be as sturdy. Works fine.
1,Terrible,"Attachment cord ripped within a week, only the middle LED comes on now (after a week of use) so its worthless using it as a flashlight outside, maybe for a small room but I paid for 9 LED's not only 1.It simply is a $5 flashlight, probably worth $2 at most."
3,Disappointing,"Nice and bright, when it works. Don't drop it. It fell apart and after putting it back together, it works intermittently."
1,It stop working in just one month,"I bought this trash on 26 Apr and it started having problem in May. At that time it worded sometime, and it totally stoped working at the begining of June, which really make me disappointed. This is the first time I wrote on amazon."
5,It`s not the size of the prize.,"I bought 8 of these to help out during the coming hurricaine season down here(Florida) and from what I see i think everything is gonna work out fine.Bright light, easy ergonomics and a great feel in your hand(it is only 3 inches long but the circumference is full in your fist and the batteries load like you were filling the chambers of a weapon .)So when the power goes off I believe the light from these little sawed-offs should fill the rooms;yes, the light is that strong.( I would suggest dumping the batteries provided and pick up duracell AAA wholesale.)Either way these flashlights seem like a great bargain for any season.And as tough as nails.(I like the silver gun metal color.It fits)"
1,Noway! Never again!!!,"This item is a real piece of C%$P... Well you know. It's a bad product. I bought three of them and the first thing was the little black strap was not on it. I tried to attach it. Forget it. Not worth the trouble. Next, I went to put one in the kitchen and it fell apart. I mean I didn't even drop it, it just sprang apart. The front popped right off. I've seen this same item in the local store for $1.99 Come on now! For the price I paid I could have gotten one OK flashlight. Now I own three really cheap ones. I would put a few drops of supper glue on the front lens edges to keep it in place. That is most likely where others are getting the flickering from, and was the reson it fell apart. The front lens popped right out. I would worn others to stay clear of this item. You could do MUCH better!!!"
2,"OK, but fragile","The product gives good light. However it is not sturdy, a fall onto a rug from about 18 inches and that was the end. Purchase something else that may cost a few bucks more, but it would still working and give better or equivalent illumination."
1,displeased,"Pretty unhappy. As I read the description, in two different places the information said the flashlight was 6"" long. In fact it is 3.5 inches. Where is the discrepency, my reading or the product description?"
4,Wow - surprisingly good,"I bought this mostly to reach $25 for free shipping, but it is really surprisingly good. I camp (a lot) with high end camping equipment, but this flashlight is just perfect to keep in my car."
1,disappointing.,I recieved this flashlight and right out of its packaging it hardly works. Thought it would at least last a week. Or so. It was so cheap its not worth paying any shipping to return it. Oh well. Ill try another cheap flashlight and hope it works.
4,GOOD!!!!,I have feel really glad about amazon for these service..... thanks for your honesty and serve
5,Emotional,"This is the story of every mother's absolute worst nightmare. The writing flows smoothly and the story is told in a realist manner. You are there, with Susan, experiencing it all. The ending left me teary-eyed and emotional. Great writing."
1,What a rip-off!,"DVD is almost entirely Pictures and Rondo, except for interviews and lame footage of the festival grounds and attendees. My sense is there is no new footage here that what was on the previous IOW offerings. The Pictures footage is almost un-watchable, due to lame stop-action and slo-mo effects. Rondo is good, however, w/o the aforementioned effects. Full Palmer drum solo is shown. Take a Pebble is almost entirely played with worthless footage of the festival grounds and attendees. No footage of Nutrocker. I suppose the interviews may be of interest. Keith, filmed in 2005, does a cool demo and plays a few bars on his Moog rig. I'm mad there's not more here, but I think I'll come to like the few bits that are there - especially Rondo."
2,Error-filled,"As other reviewers have noted, there are problems with this book, despite its laudable intent. In short, it is doubtful that the author speaks fluent Spanish herself, and it seems as if she simply opened a Spanish-English dictionary to create the book.For example, for 'azul/blue' she displays a fish, which she calls a ""pescado."" As any second-year Spanish student can tell you, the animal is a 'pez' whereas prepared food is called 'pescado' (literally, ""that which has been fished""). Also, on the back cover she writes ""¡Recolecte todos los libres en la serie!"" (Collect all the books in the series). The verb ""recolectar"" means ""to gather"", not ""to collect"" as in a collection (she needed to use ""coleccionar"")As a Spanish professor, I commend her good intentions with this book, but I cannot recommend this book until the errors are corrected."
2,How big is it ?,"The dimensions shown are 3.62"" x 1.89"" x 1.18"", these seem sort of odd for a round filter. I can't tell if it will fit in my drain from these dimensions and I'm not buying it if it won't fit."
2,More trouble than it's worth,"I bought this product thinking hay triple the pleasure. Well, this was more trouble than it's worth. One you need to have all 3 suctions in place and hold them there while pumping the pump. It isn't easy it takes quite a bit of manuvering and once you finally get the suctioning working it isn't an equal suctioning. Might be too hard on the nipples and not enough on the clit. The vibrating was so so but after 30 minutes the batteries died. All of them. I gave it 2 stars because over all it has some stimulation but it didn't give me the pleasure I thought it would."
3,Not ok for grade 7,"Amazon wrote that it's recommended for grade 7 and up, and I respectfully disagree with this. I recognize that this is a great book, but it belongs in the hands of an adult or a very mature older teen. The content involves graphic, explicit sexual descriptions of foreplay, details of beatings, harsh language, etc. Please read the book before you give it to your child."
4,Gucci Men's 5505 Review,"This is a very nice watch, any man who wears it will look sharp. I love the simple yet decadent design. The only negative statement I can make is that it is a little small compared to most men's watches."
3,as described,"I have a leather calender\phone directory, this was the only refill that fit exactly. I think it was too expensive for what i got, but I didn't want to give up the planner."
5,MUSIC,"NANCY IS WONDERFUL ,,,,,,,,,,,,,I LISTENED TO THIS CD TRAVELING TO CALIFORNIA TO OHIO.MARVELOUS!!!!!!!IT TELLS A STORY love story. wonderful...............i love it you will too"
2,Phony Radio City!,"The second year I went to Radio City Music Hall for their Christmas show, I was so thrilled to buy the ""soundtrack"" from their gift shop. When I came home, I could hardly wait to play it. I was shocked to see that it was recorded in ENGLAND, and NOT at Radio City Music Hall. The jacket was trumped to look like New York. The organs were DIFFERENT, the choir was that of The Stephen Hill Singers, and it was recorded in All Saints Church, Petersham, U.K.. The Orchestra was the U.K. Symphony conducted by Harry Rabinowitz,O.B., and remixed at Twickenham Music Studios, U.K..So next time you're wanting to get a copy of the EXACT musical production you heard in New York's Radio City Music Hall, look in the disc to be SURE where it was recorded."
4,Book Report-White Star,"White Star is a book about a boy named Sam Harris.He sails from England to America to live with his mom and stepdad.When Sam is on the Titanic,he finds out there are dogs on board.He finds a dog that he really likes. The dog is the pride of the White Star line.Sam calls him Star.One freezing cold night Sam is jolted out of his sleepby aloud noise.He knows somthing is very wrong because he sees a huge iceburg from his porthole.This is a book about an unbreakable bond beewteen a boy and a dogon one terrifiying totally unforgetuble night."
1,Literatura colombiana en decadencia.,"Voy por la mitad del libro no se si continuar. Que mala calidad. Los dialogos son tan simples, tan escuchados una y otra vez en telenovelitas de a peso. Me di cuenta que el libro era malo cuando el autor en las primeras paginas hace alusion a la cancion de Mecano. Que falta de imaginacion y creatividad. Yo creo que Campo Elias hubiera escrito un mejor best seller. No lo compren. Inviertan en pandebonos."
1,waste of film,"This is the case of a sexy dvd box used to sell a dregg of a movie.The ""star' is a slightly overweight actress who plays a retarded girl treated like a dog,really,with collar and everything.A sister whose as demented as her brother comes to stay with the brother and is slightly more sympathetic but not much.She dresses Jessica up and then confuses her when she takes her along on her date.Jessica snaps,foams at the mouth and kills her sister.Her brother shoots her like a rabid dog.Nowhere as interesting as it sounds.Only republicans could symnpathize with the main characters"
5,Great Grindhouse Style,"This movie is not for the weak stomached, or people expecting academy award style film. However if you enjoy blood, beautiful women, and old style grindhouse films. Buy this and enjoy Elske as Jessica."
5,CREATIVE's Superb Webcam,It is a superior product in its class. Superb clarity and sound. This item arrived in perfect packaging and was delivered within committed time. Superb. Recommendable to everyone who wants a quality webcam product!! Cheers !!
3,Works great - just not with Vista,Clairty if outstanding - if it only worked with Vista correcly. Have downloaded drivers from everywhere with no consistent success. Works fine with XP.
3,"OK, but dated","Published in the mid-nineties, this book is a fairly selective encyclopedia of the Blues. No entry on Ken Bates? Still, it provides basic information on many of the CFC greats (Charlie Cooke, Ray Wilkins, Peter Osgood, etc.). Would be nice to have this updated to include information on Vialli, Zola."
3,"I like it, dog doesn't.","It was made fine, but my dog refuses to use it. It fits in a medium sized crate. It might work better for female dogs but my little guy is still looking for something vertical to aim at."
3,It' an ok product,"The product is ok. I guess I was just expecting something more. I ordered the LARGE and it's not really that large. It's too small for two average sized trainging pads and WAY too big for just one training pad.I wish that there was rubber padding on the underside of the edges to help it stay in place.Please don't get the wrong message from my post, it is an OK product and will hold your training pads in place, for the most part."
5,Best Tray for Your Pads,"Before I had this tray, my Morkie was chewing and tearing up her pads. Now she doesn't bother them at all. It holds the pad securely and is very quick and easy to change. As far as cleaning; a quick wipe with an anti-bacterial wipe and its ready to go. Great value for the price."
2,"Please understand,I sent one back and never got credit for it...","The item is great,helped in traning my new puppy.I was sent two by your mistake and never got the credit for sending it back.Would you please look into this for me..Thank you very much.Phyllis Ecker"
5,Convenient and a huge mess reducer!,"I have two Pomeranian puppies and they are great at making a big mess. Their favorite game was to drag their potty pads all over including into their kennel where they sleep and then shred them to bits and consuming some of it I am sure. This has stopped all that! The tray even has secure pad catchers in the middle allowing you to secure the pads flat to the surface to prevent wrinkling when they walk across the pad or if your pups are like my little Liberty, she likes to scratch her hind legs after she relieves herself. These catchers hold them in place. It takes two pads to cover then entire surface, but worth it! I highly recommend this product. It is easy to clean up and move around the house. Best investment I made for the pups yet!"
4,Good,Pretty good .. however the dog can still rip the pad by biting the center ... Apart from that the holder is pretty good.. keeps the pad in place!!
3,I'm not really sure,"This is a simple potty trainer. My daughter isn't actually using it yet, so I'm not really sure about how she likes it. It is light weight, and I like the fact that it is easy to remove."
1,Scares my dog,This product has the distinction of being the only thing my dog will not eurinate on . If I put her in the item she will gust sit there as if she is being punished . THANKS
3,Perfect,Pan had a crack on the side. Thought it would stop my dog from tearing but didnt. Otherwise good. Quick shipment
2,very dissapointed in the pee pad holder by iris,We were very unhappy with the Iris pee pad holder we received from Amazon. It came to us warped and missing the floor foot pads. Great comcept but very poor construction.
3,When giants roamed - and Bill Withuhn offers vacuous comments,"This would have been a fantastic video if the frequent comments from Bill Withuhn had been left out. The comments are opinion, not fact, and anytime I hear him speak I am reminded that he is a politician rather than a railroader or railroad fan. Michael Palin would have been the perfect host for this video as seen in his recent journeys series with Nat Geographic.The video of steam trains in action in the DVD does compensate for the issue above, however. Good variety and very high quality. Loved the N&W; Y and UP Big Boy footage."
3,Love the smell but can't see any difference,"I really like the smell of this product and it seems like a little does go a long way, but I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and I really can't see any benefit thus far. On top of that, my product was only 3/4 full so I was a bit upset that it is so expensive and it appeared that some of it was taken out prior to mailing. If it wasn't for the smell I would have probably rated it lower."
2,Mostly focuses on geneology research,"This book is very thick and would seem to be helpful in planning a family reunion, however, it seemed to focus more on geneology research and finding lost family members. It came with a CD-Rom, so I guess that was a perk."
5,Thank you!,Thank you.. quick shipping.. just what I needed to start my reunion!! =) I didnt know where to begin until I received this book. Has a lot of great information in it. The CD is also very helpful.
2,Freddi Fish,I find this program very complicated. I can't even figure it out so I'm not sure how my 3 year old will.
1,pissed,"i never recieved this product although i paid for it in full and the seller never even contacted me to tell me why they never sent it. what horrible business, tackier if they dont bother to contact their customers of the delays or not sending it!!"
4,Another Great Bruder Toy,"Everything works about this set. All the parts on the loader operate smoothly and easily. The details are appropriate for the price and the intended purpose -- play -- of the set. My three year old has great fun switching out the attachments. The only negative is that when detaching and reattaching parts, it is a bit too easy to crack the plastic around the connectors. This happened to my son's set. However, even with the cracks, everything still operates well."
3,Darn Those Publishers!,I'll never know what a good story this is because I gave up about 50 pages in. The reason being that an inch or so at the beginning or end of each page was lost into the binding. It drives me crazy when publishers do this in the name of profits.It makes reading very difficult. I finally got tired of struggling with this book. Too bad as I like Ms. Rice's books. She has a definite way with a story. I'm not going to bother donating this to the local library for some other poor reader to struggle with. Even breaking the spine didn't help. I think the only thing that would might be to take the pages out individually to read. What a mess that would be.The 3 stars is strictly for Patricia Rice. It's certainly not her fault that the printing is so annoying to me that I couldn't get through to the end.
3,Not my type,"This book was a little too predictable but a good romance novel. I don't usually read romance novels so I must have not read the preview very well before buying. Never the less, I did enjoy it for the most part - easy read for a Sunday afternoon."
1,tragically short remixes...,"Well, for starters, I was hoping the incredible mix I hear on the radio that backs Alicia's vocals with the instrumental version of Stevie Wonder's ""Superstition"" would be on here, but it is not. Next, the hani mix of Diary is an edit, not even running 4 minutes. And finally, the 2 remixes of Karma are both a bit over 3 minutes, and neither is as strong a mix as the original. One has a reggae feel, the other is just a heavier hip hop mix."
2,SHERMEN'S MARCH,"tHIS BOOK SHOULD BE READ BY SOMEONE WHO ALREADY HAS READ MUCH ABOUT THE CIVIL WAR, iT IS CHOCK FULL OF PERSONAL INFO,BUT WILL BE CONFUSING TO THE A READER WHO IS NOT FAMILAR WITH THE CHARACTERS AND PLACES"
2,Doesn't hold up,"We bought a sled with the same construction for my daughter. Loved the ride and it controlled well, but after only 40 minutes of normal use the plastic bottom started peeling from the foam upper. We had to return it."
1,Poor quality,"It was a great fan while it worked, but after only a month the on/off switch cracked and it was unusable. I used it in my office for about an hour after going to the gym because I'd still be hot. Well, 5 days a week for a month, means I turned it on 20 times and then off 20 times. 40 clicks and it was over."
2,Bad design decisions,"I can't believe no one mentioned this, but the switch goes from off to high to medium to low. It doesn't go from off to low or vice versa. If you want to set it to low, you have to switch to high and then to medium first. This really annoyed me, especially because the low setting is the only one that's very quiet. The other two are rather loud.Another thing I didn't like is that it tilts up, but not down. If you don't need this, then you won't notice.The plastic is of higher quality than cheaper fans, but considering that it doesn't oscillate, it wasn't worth it for me."
2,It was great for a year,"I have the Vornado 530 3 speed compact fan. It was great for the first year of owning it.. It was very powerful and provided great ""white noise"" while I slept at night. I live in So. California so I pretty much used it every night while I sleep mainly because I can't sleep without the sound of a fan running, and well, I live in So. California. But anyway, after a year of owning it it started squeaking and at times the blade wouldn't spin when I would first turn turn the fan on. I have cleaned the motor and sprayed WD-40 everywhere I could, but to no avail, it continued to squeak despite cleaning it as best I could. One would think that these little fans would last for longer than a year."
1,Makes too much noise!,"I previously owned the Vornado 510W compact air circulating fan, and I was very happy with the low noise level and the air exchange capabilities. Unfortunately after several knocks to the floor over 4 years it stopped working.Then I order this model (530B) as a replacement. In the lowest speed it rattled like an old pick up truck with a payload of aluminum cans. In the two higher speeds the unit rattled less but was as loud as those huge metal ""industrial"" fans that are used in gyms or dance clubs to move vast amounts of stale air. Usually the hum of a fan helps me sleep at night, but this Vornado was WAY too disruptive. The fan's noise dominated the room such that I couldn't watch TV at a decent volume. I'm returning this fan. This is a disappointing product from Vornado brand."
3,"too loud, but moves air decently","We had a cheap honeywell vornado knockoff that was obnoxiously loud, so I wanted to replace it with a vornado, under the assumption that it would be whisper quiet like they advertise. It's not very quiet at all, even on it's lowest setting. It's too loud for a bedroom. It does move air well though."
2,Stopped working after 2 years.,"While this fan was working, I would have rated it a 3 or 4, but after only two years of use it died. No physical damage. One day I turned it off and the next day when I switched it on nothing happened. Based on other reviews here, it sounds like the warranty service costs almost as much as a new fan. I expected better from an expensive brand like Vornado."
2,BORING,My 6-year old finished this entire game in the first day he had it. He said it does the same old things that all prevous ones did. He doesn't want any future Spy Fox games unless they find away to make their games more challenging and interesting.
5,The Best of Both Worlds,"Wow - Nancy really did it! I knew her in the '80s and early '90s and she practiced with our coven. She always said that Christianity had a Goddess and she would prove it! Nobody would give her a break. I should have known she would find a way, she knows what she wants and goes after it. Goddess Bless"
1,Does not work,"I bought this item to charge my iPhone 4 in the car. When I plugged it in, a message appeared on the phone that it was not compatible with the charger. I tried it with my 80 GB iPod Classic, and got the same message. I read the reviews before buying it, and they led me to believe my devices were compatible with the charger, but they weren't. Very disappointing."
4,still one of the best party cds around,"the ministry of sound annual series advertises itself as a hot party disc, as it contains basically all the club anthems of the past year in continuous, energetic fashion. it's not groundbreaking by any means, but it doesn't claim to be in any way. it serves its purpose admirably though, and won't fail in keeping people on the dance floor if they have any notion of what a good time is all about. if you don't own any of the annuals, this is a good bet. if you prefer lesser known material in this same club-anthem compilation vein, go for the excellent ""cream anthems 2000"". otherwise, this is about as good as a dance-party set comes."
3,A few complaints,"Donald Tyson is a very goodfiction writer which this book is of course. My chiefcomplaint is his inclusion of Judaic sources such as including the ""sacred"" book'Berashith',some kabbalah, and most puzzling a mention of two rows of 11 tall pillars underneath theSphinx in a chamber with each pillar carved with a Hebrew letter. What is he trying to say? There are other Judeo-Christian touches,but in all my readings, nowhere in Lovecraft's writings, not even Derleth's has Kabbalism ever been used. I do like his link of Shub-Niggarath with Lilith.Another problem is the use of his selection of Dagon as a high ranking Old One whereas Dagon was a minor god.I like his sigils but the Old Ones really can be worked only with Chaos Magic / The Left Hand Pathand your Golden Dawn paraphanalia will have to be safely tucked in your closet."
5,A wonderful variety of quick Christmas projects!,"I chose this book because I wanted to do a few ornaments, but now I want to sew every chart! The variety in this book includes ornaments, pillows, towels, clothes, napkins, table linens, stocking, tote bags, and more. Every design is easy to make and are truly ""Quickies!"""
2,size,i ordered 2 of these subs to put em in da doors of my 2001 nissan altima.i set everything up and i only needed the subs and when they came i measured them an they r 6.5 inches NOT 6..and 1 of the screws was jacked up an i could even use it if the subs were the right size.so know that these are 6.5 inches
5,I love this book!,This book covers just about everything related to the art of fortunetelling.Very cute book. Though if you are looking for indepth explanations for specific fortune telling techniques you should look elsewhere.This is just a generalization that covers a vast spectrum of forms of fortune telling.
4,Cot,The parts are not labeled so when you get it just take a sec to label the parts with paper and put tape over it so it down not come off. But easy to put together and weight limit they say when we called is 200 BUT NOT at all...more like 125... It good though!!
1,Please just spend a little more money,"First of all, this cot is SOOOOO ridiculous to put together. It took me and my husband together about an hour!Then, I slept on it 1 time and it totally ripped the canvas. Please just spend a little more money and get something that is truely useful!"
5,Glory Days,"The late nights, waiting up to catch Fred heckling the world were well worth it, but i always wanted to have my own Marathon of the shows I could never get enough of. This set is very nice, from the packaging, which features tidbits of history from the show, to the fold out display and biography book. I also like the show lineup which tells you exactly what disc has what, and what each show is about. I expected less, and got so much more, and would recommend this to those die hard fans of the ""real world"" antics of a real world figure."
5,A book to remember,"Although I believe this book may seem to be dated, in many ways, in light of the e-commerce boom, it actually seems more timely. The only regret for me is that he hasn't, it seems been updated the information to include the internet.The marketing concepts though continue to be useful and worth reading."
3,"nice, but the collar has wrinkled...","I'm not quite sure what the deal is, but the collar on this shirt has wrinkled in a weird way. It's almost as if there's some paper inside or something, that didn't like getting wet.Other than that, it's a nice shirt... and fortunately I have long hair which mostly covers up the collar, so... :-)"
5,"very well made, sturdy","Very pleased with the bench cover. Stays in place, no problem with the high winds we have had lately. Feels like the vinyl is heavy enough to last for a while, haven't had it but for couple of months, too early to say. I would recommend this product."
5,Good sturdy cover,Fits my outdoor sofa very well. Very plesed with the sturdy fabric. The velcro fastners holds it in place and has stayed put through the rain and wind. Gret price.
5,the best,I have several of these and they are the best and most stable that I have. Everything I have is now on HTC bases. Now nothing gets in the way.
2,Doesn't work for my skin,Dont like how the mask smells. Felt like it worked the first time but after a couple uses i started breaking out for no reason.
4,"Works well, smells great",I've started using it this week and my face feels smoother around the t-zone. It does not dry out my face at all and it smells great compared to other masks I've used.
5,Necessary for every woman,"I don't go anywhere without this mask. I've had great success with it improving the overall condition of my skin. Any existing whiteheads that you have will be drawn to the surface, pores will be minimized, and oily skin will be cleaneed. It's so affordable and the amount they give you lasts forever. Virtually perfect!"
3,"OK, but not as good as the other one","I love the facial masks of Queen Helene. Great quality for a great price. This time I doubted between this one and their other famous facial mask, the Mint mask. After having read the reviews, I decided to buy this one, especially since so many wrote about helping with fine lines, sagging skin, etc. I like this mask, it gives my skin a nice glow, but I wish I had bought the Mint mask, I have bought that one before and the Mint mask really CLEANS my skin, it feel and look so fresh and healthy, which is great for my oily skin."
2,a pompous book by a pompous man,"Titon unquestionably knows his subject matter well, and this does come through in the book. Unfortunately, he drains the topic of all the spontaneity and joy that one associates with music with a pendantic and tendetious approach. His writing style, in my experience, aptly reflects his personality. I once took a college class from him when he served as a visiting professor at Carleton College in Minnesota. This book was a mandatory assignment...more royalties for the professor. If you are prepared to take the subject as seriously as Titon takes himself, this book could be for you. Otherwise, there are surely more accessible and informative works to begin a study of this distinctively American musical form."
4,She's done better,"I love Patricia Rice and have all of her books. This convoluted tale of innocent ex-con Adrian Quinn and Faith Hope Nichols, the hard done by widow of his late partner Tony, is just not quite up to her usual standards. Faith is too saintly, for one. Everybody is somehow too neatly connected for another. The hero works his way through law school and then settles down to make pots of money also has made the time to make serious pots? ( even though potting is a family tradition ). Faith somehow ( how? ) has the knowlege, although she was a child bride, to open and make a success out of what sounds like a serious gallery. Still a good read, but just not up to her usual stellar standards."
5,Beloved Music,"I have been a fan for a long time, and I can say that all you hear is true.....the cd's are great, but the live shows are an unbelievable party of die hard fans. I listen to at least some Fenians everyday, and I own all the cd's. Being the lover of music that I am, I feel my life has been truly enriched with the bounty the Fenians have placed before me. You are missing out on a great experience and a new favorite if you do not buy this right now!!"
4,Not for Beginner Engineers,"I highly recommend that you get some knowledge about recording, because Mark does not stop at all to tell you what each thing he talks about is. He already assumes that you know it. But, past the engineering stuff, Mark really gives some solid advice on micing your drum set and the different options. And he does it in a funny matter, too! I recommend his advice to many. He gives some pretty good tips on preparing for gigs and more. This is not something that should be in a drummer's essential list but I do recommend that you check it out!"
4,4 stars for Bostonian,"I've enjoyed wearing them very much. They are a fine looking shoe, and comfortable, too."
5,Reading the Cards.......,"I needed an easy, quick way to become a fortune teller for our High School After Prom Party. This book was great and did the job. After using this for 3 years I am quite an accomplished (rookie) fortune teller. The kids loved it and you can be quite entertaining. What is amazing is how they relate their fotune to what is happening NOW in their lives. This set made learning to ""read the cards"" really easy and fun. A must for beginners."
2,Along the Healing Path Book,"I have been recently diagnosed with IC. I am trying to get through this book but it is a tough read. The author goes on and on about the same thing for much of the book. I am going to get through it and try some of her advice however, to see if I can get relief."
5,Excellent IC Recovery Guide,"This book, as well as Catherine Simone's first book, is a must-have for anyone who is serious about taking charge of their own health and recovering from IC. A year ago, I read Cath's first book and began trying the suggestions she made. A year later, I am MUCH improved. I read her second book recently and found more useful information that I have already begun to put into practice. The suggestions she makes are self-help based and easy to do at home. She offers a very compelling theory for what causes IC and a practical approach to overcome it, always with the patient's comfort and safety in mind. She also encourages individual choice and research, rather than dictating some rigid program to follow. Her compassion and understanding of fellow IC sufferers really comes through. Finding Catherine's first book changed my life last year and her new book is prompting further changes. There's lots of hope and inspiration here!"
2,I'd rather build my own kit.,"This kit contains a nasal aspirator, digital thermometer with case, soft-tip medicine dispenser, comfort tip medicine spoon with cap, magnifying nail clipper and a travel/storage bag.Pros:Comes as a set in a bag (you don't loose items as easily.Cons:-I'd rather have the smaller nail clippers without magnifying glass-The nasal aspirator from the hospital is better-I think it is dangerous to use the medicine dispensers included versus the droppers that come with medicationsSummary:It is convenient to have a bag with everything you ""need,"" but this might be more than you need, or different than you need."
2,Great Idea but........,"I thought I needed a kit like this when I was registering for my 1st baby. I recieved this as a shower gift and it turns out, I never even used most of it. The nail clippers are great (buy them seperatly!), but the nasal aspirator doesn't work at all and I never used the medicine dispensers since all of my daughters' medicine had dispensers. Bottom line, compete waste of money- but buy the nail clippers!"
3,The title says it all,After seeing this series you may want to go back to the library and see who works there. The setting is in a small bookshop but you kinda want to start checking out books again.
2,Does not work as advertised.,"This product claims to ""lift and draw out impurities from the pores"" but it doesn't have much lift force. It doesn't adhere well to black heads, and when I peel off the mask, I don't see the white and black heads on the peel, like I do on biore strips.Perhaps its meant for light use, but I can say it smells really good."
5,like it alot,"I just started using this product a few weeks ago. I am a big QH product lover and have been experimenting alot with new makeup, skincare etc in the past month.I wanted something that would 'dissolve' crap in my pores(if that makes sense).This mask is goopy, and it smells pretty strong, but you can feel it working. It almost is like a enzyme cleaner. I feel like its soaking deep and getting the job done.It minimizes pores and makes your skin ultra smooth after using it."
3,"Low cost, but...","This don't cost that much, it does catch fleas. But the light broke after about 2-3 days of using this.I guess I will purchase another one another time and hope the next one works better."
2,Don't waste your money,"I bought 2 of these because a family member had tried them in the past and had success. Not the case for me! It didn't attract or catch a single flea! The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it caught a few flies and gnats. If you're looking for something to help lower your flea population, look elsewhere!"
4,missing parts,I know this product works I just received one that is missing some parts. I guess I will have to call this company ant tell them what I need to get this one up and working...I have bought these type before and kept them on 24/7 they are good at night not for just fleas but all flying things that likes light and in the summer its great for what comes in your home it go right to the sticky paper and so do fly's I have noticed.
2,Didn't work as expected,"Shipping was fast, unfortunately the trap did not work as expected. I purchased based on reviews on Amazon. I did not have the trap 'covered in fleas' as several reviewers had stated. I know there were fleas on the dogs and even though I used it according to directions, it took almost a week of constant use to get 20 fleas. Works great on dust bunnies"
2,not really worth it,"I followed the instructions, and it did catch about 20 fleas, but we really didn't use it after that. Did it work? yeah, kind of, but really not that necessary in my opinion. It was more effective to vacuum with a cheap flea collar in the bag and the other instructions for ridding your house of fleas. Nice idea though."
2,Did not attract fleas,"I've had the Victor flea trap constantly on for two weeks straight. In that time it has caught one small beetle bug and one very small bug, perhaps a flea.During this time I have been bitten constantly by fleas, and the trap has been placed in the area where I am most often bit.I can only conclude the flea trap does not really attract fleas, and has really done nothing for me but provide a night light.It may work better for someone with an overwhelming volume of fleas on the ground."
1,Didn't work for us.,"After using this trap for 2 weeks, we caught a total of 5 fleas. In that time I received at least double that number of flea bites - and my wife killed 10 times that number just pulling them off the dogs and cats.This trap failed to make a dent in the flea population in our home. We have 3 dogs and 2 cats and lots and lots of fleas as a result. This trap failed to catch fleas I saw jumping around it. I've used another brand that works on the same pricipal - small light bulb that draws the fleas to a sticky surface, and that one worked pretty well. This one was basically a FAIL.This is going back (along with the refill pack I grabbed in my hopes the glue papers would fill up in a few nights).After realizing this wasn't working, I plunked down the cash and bought a tub of fleabusters. That worked, and should contiue working for a year.I do not recommend this product."
5,Victor M230 Ultimate Flea Trap,"Not sure what it is, but all I can say is that it work. Something about this thing really attracts fleas and with no mess."
3,It is what it is.,"Honestly, I could have saved my money on this one had I rigged up something similar, but it would not have been as nice. .It is well made, and a good product, but honestly, I could have suspended a 4 watt bulb over some contact paper (sticky side up). The light emits warmth which attracts the fleas. The sticky paper holds them in place while they await their final fate.I give this 3-stars because of the nice workmanship, the ingenuity and the prompt delivery."
3,Low Cost Flea Infestation Control,"I have had good luck just taking a shallow pan about the size of an oil pan, or 4qt cook pan, put a little dawn soap in it, add about 2 inches of water, and then suspend a light over it so it shines into the pan. Catches bunches of fleas for practically nothing. I just refill the water once in awhile when it evaporates. Leave the light on day and night, they especially flock to it at night when it's the only light on. It really works!"
2,I suspect its a night light at best but maybe i'm just in the middle of the flea cycle,since i ahve been attacking my flea issue from many angles i am unsure if this is just a strange looking night light or actually effective in some way. it hasn't caught a single flea i can see but i have been bombing and spraying with IGRs so who knows? I don't think I will buy any replacements for this but my cats kind of like - they sit next to it - so I won't return it.
4,Works great...,"As advertised. I didn't give it 5 stars because that would be perfect, and I don't think there is any such thing, especially when it comes to getting rid of fleas. It won't take care of your flea issue alone, but in conjunction w/ other things, it's a great tool."
1,not working for me,I tried 5 different rooms in my house it did get any fleas. But I found them in my comb and my son is still getting flea bits. I real wish it works because I needed something non chemical. But a big disappointment.
1,I wanted to like it,"I really wanted this to work so that I wouldn't have to use chemicals. But despite being bitten by nasty fleas, the two traps that I bought only snagged two fleas and a few tiny gnats over a period of 5 days. I had to resort to sprays to rid myself of the tiny buggers."
2,Not the greatest,"I ordered this product during a heavy infestation in my house. I hoped that using this, along with treating my animals, vaccuming daily, and having the pest control people spray, that the problem would be solved. That was three months ago. I am still seeing fleas. My children are being bitten. And the trap has not caught one single flea."
1,Cheaply made.,"The directions say when assembling, not to over screw the threaded light bulb protector. Unfortunately, the box came with the light bulb already screwed into the light socket and the protector already over screwed. It was impossible to get it off and therefor impossible to correctly assemble the light to the top of the ""canopy"". We ended up breaking the socket protector to get it off and to be able to put the light in place. (We had to tape it in place). Next, the paper over the glue pad stuck to the glue and we ended up with a glue pad only half sticky. We are to give this piece of crap a try to see if it can catch anything in it's half assembled state.This is a piece of junk. Buy a different brand! Don't waste your money."
2,"Didn't work for me, but the paper is really sticky!","I bought this over a month ago and still haven't caught a single flea. It did get my hair and my cat's paw (I ended up cutting a bit of my hair and some of my cat's fur from her paw was still on the paper when i pulled it off). I never had a big flea problem and so that's probably why I didn't catch any. Since fleas are attracted to warmth, I placed this in both a warm apartment and a cold one but it didn't make any difference. I personally think it would work better on other insects like gnats or ants."
3,Works. But...,I bought 3 of these units in an effort to avoid using chemicals in my home. 2 of the 3 work great. The light-bulb in the 3rd burned out as soon as it was plugged in and I have had a difficult time getting the issue resolved with the manufacturer. Buy extra sticky pads because they are only good for 2-4 weeks.
5,Absolutely fantastic!!,This thing is great! We had a flea problem but didnt really know what to do. Constant vaccuuming and trying different methods and then we got this thing. We put it out and in two days there were over 50 fleas on it. The thing is SUPER sticky and you can get stuck on this thing if you dont watch out.Works GREAT!
3,Free Hair Removal With Purchase,"I'm convinced that my kitties didn't have a flea problem, because this trap caught everything but fleas. Ants... Mosquitoes... Me.I've had it for a few months and it's done a good job with the ants that go after the cat food. It's caught the random mosquitoes that make it into the house.Unfortunately the bulb connection is loose somewhere, and we're going through the ""bump it to make it work"" routine. I stupidly decided that my small hands could take care of the problem without disassembling the trap first.Bad idea, because this flea trap doesn't discriminate. Before I knew it, the trap had caught the skin & fine hairs on the back of my hand. And it held on tight.Given the bruises and missing hair that resulted, I'd have to say that bugs who land on this thing don't stand a chance.Summary: great sticky pad, bad wiring. It's hard to beat the price. And you might want to keep Goo Gone in the house."
1,Did not work at all,"I had the unfortunate experience of having my apartment infested with fleas. It was the worst. I bought this in the hopes of some relief, but it did nothing. It managed to catch a fly and a spider, but no fleas. Would not recommend this to anyone."
2,Only worked for 3 weeks...,"This flea trap is very effective! My infestation is out of control and this sucker is catching 50-60 fleas in a week. Awesome! However 3 weeks after purchasing, the bulb has blown out. Now it's useless to me. Hopefully I can buy some replacement bulbs, because I'd like to try to keep using it."
2,Light Stopped working.,"The sticky paper is really sticky...and the idea seems like it would work... but the light stopped working within a few days of us getting the product. May eventually try to get another light at the store... But for now, we have a non functioning unit. Money not really well spent..."
2,Its ok,I bought this trap to trap fleas but itdidnt trap anything maybe i have no fleas.I keep it on all night and when i wake up the trapis empty:(
5,Works Great!,"Spring has sprung and *YUCK* fleas in the house!! I hate it, but it comes with owning pets. I put this down on the carpet where the cats hang out and by morning there were at least 30 fleas stuck to it. If they touch the sticky paper they can't get back off! The light draws them inside (not as quickly as movement and vibration of footsteps will). Not sure it will catch every single one, but it still means less fleas that will breed and multiply! I'm getting a couple more for the other rooms that my pets frequently nap or play. Another flea ridding trick for the ones on the pets, use a flea comb and drop the evil bugs into a cup of straight rubbing alcohol, less messy than ""popping"" them."
3,Easy to put together,"It didn't catch any of the fleas. But to be fair, I also used Borax on the carpets the day before."
5,These Work AMAZINGLY WELL!!!,"I was hesistant when these arrived, as they don't seem like much - cheap plastic, with a little Christmas light, and a sticky paper. BUT OH MY GOODNESS do they work amazingly well! You may see little specks of dust on them but that is the baby fleas. It really helps while you do the things you need to to get rid of fleas! We had hardwood and tile floors, but were in the middle of a renovation when we had the problem! These helped us get a handle on them! It worked wonderfully!Not entirely inexpensive to get enough for every room in the house, but work amazingly well! The only improvement I could see would be battery operation!"
4,flea trap,"it works, bought a puppy with fleas this picks up those we could not see but you need other things besides like chemicals"
1,Candle in soapy water is more effective,"I have had a small flea problem for several months, never more than a handful seen in any given day, and usually only one or two. I tried setting out trays of soapy water with a lit candle at nighttime. This typically resulted in a handful of caught fleas by morning. I bought this product hoping to increase the amount of fleas caught. To date it has yet to catch a single flea. I wondered if my other methods had killed off the population (diatomaceous earth, Hot Shot bombs, Raid spray), so I went back to my candle in soapy water technique and have since caught several more fleas. This product may only be effective with a massive infestation."
4,Really works!,"These traps really work. They surely catch fleas, however, they will not resolve a flea infestation. This requires other products. But the traps are excellent to measure the grade of infestation and to determine in which areas of the house there is an actual problem. This product does not seem to be intended for anything else. Also, these traps do not work by light but through the heat the lamp creates. Thereby, it emulates the warmth of a body. So, if a trap is placed in a well-heated room or next to an animal, it will not work particularly well."
4,Excellent product!,"I only have 2 complaints---1) There isnt a local retailer for refills for the product2) I had a unit that shorted out after 2 months. Customer service did a excellent job and sent me a replacement free of cost.The bulbs are easy enough to find at the local hardware store.This thing is insane for flea infestations. Usually I would use chemicals but being a new mom, thats pretty much out of the question. Aside from spot treatments on our animals. No sprays or any of that jazz.The first night, we placed 2 in our house, the next day there had to have been over 100 fleas caught. A lot of them big ole ""bout to lay me some eggs"" looking fleas. After a week all the fleas in the traps were tiny. It has not cured our problem but it has definitely helped.If you need replacement glue pads, order them, but while waiting, put a bit of water in the bottom trap and dawn dishsoap. Works well until you can get more refills."
1,Not one flea,i placed it in an area for 48 hours were there were many fleas before AND after. i feel the positive reviews here were likely planted.
1,Doesn't worth the price,"The packaging itself is awful. They leave the light bulb dangling. I bought three and one of them broke. As for functionality, I turned one on right on my foot side and I still got bite. I check the sticker, and it catches nothing."
1,Garbage,"this product is just garbage, useless, poor quality materials,it doesn't work.Is only a waste of electricity.Amazon should stop offering this.I would give it a 0 star rating if possible."
1,"Not effective, over priced for what it is.","This is just a light bulb and some sticky paper. While in theory this might work to attract fleas, it did not work for me. My dog has only a minor flea problem, so maybe this works for true infestations. Consider trying to treat your animal before you try this product."
1,Garbage!!!,"This is the worst $18 I have ever spent! Had I imagined what this product was in reality, I would have never paid for it. I could have made it myself. The description of this product is misleading. It's just a piece of plastic, a sticky tape and a light bulb. I could make it myself and not spend $18. Very, Very disappointed!!!!"
1,Flea Trap,I purchased this product and I know that I had fleas and had tried all kind of things to get rid of them. I used the trap and got no results with it. I had better results wearing white socks to pick the fleas off them. I would never recommend this product to anyone. It's a rip off
3,The jury's still out............,"On my first visit to a new vet, she tells me that my cat has fleas (indoor cat, never had fleas in her entire three-year life). I was also skeptical because I am religious about her Frontline. Anyway, the vet said that topical treatments only keep a cat from getting fleas, my home was probably still infested. She suggested spraying my cat's bedding with a treatment, which is scary, since HER bedding is MY bedding, and most sprays are toxic! So, I set out this trap for 24 hours. And nothing. I hesitate to say it didn't work, though. I think the vet was defective not the flea trap! It makes a good nightlight, though, and it does catch gnats/mosquitoes! In conclusion, am I sorry I bought it? No. Does it work? I don't know!"
3,Not as good as the competition,"I purchased this one and the BioCare flea trap at the same time. the light bulb has already blown out of this and it has not been one week. Additionally, there is no cover, so to speak over the sticky pad thereby allowing cat hair to stick as well as the fleas. I am not sure the sticky will last as long as the other one as there is a ""hair catcher"" over the sticky pad. both are catching fleas in a space that has had the carpet treated and has been bombed. If you are going to purchase a flea trap, I would recommend the other brand."
3,"It works, but the light burns out fast","I like this product...it really did work, but the light bulb burnt out within a week. The bulbs a 120v 7w, which are not easy to find."
2,Flease are still jumping.,"I so wanted this flea trap to work. So many good things go into thepremise. It operates safely among animals and children, it is non toxic,and easy to use.However after setting up as instructed and waiting for over a week, no fleaswere trapped. I am disappointed as I bought three of them and needed helpcatching fleas.These traps will be returned."
3,Works ok!,"After about 3 weeks I was able to catch about 8 fleas on this. I wasn't too impressed with this, especially when I was battling fleas on my dog like crazy. This trap has been set up next to his bed for the last 6 weeks. It catches more dog hair then anything else."
1,Light bulb burnt out the first night,"I was very excited to get this, but the light bulb burnt out the first night of use. I suppose I'm supposed to now go out looking for this type of light bulb. I order on Amazon just to avoid searching for items in stores, and going to the stores, which takes time away from work."
2,Horrible,Did not work. I left it in my room for about an hour on my carpet and caught nothing. Waste of money.
2,Worthless!,"I bought these two or three months after I adopted a Chihuahua mix.The vet said that she had some fleas, so I bought the appropriate meds.I became paranoid about the two or three months before I treated my pet.I had three or four bites on my legs already. What if fleas werehatching in the carpet or on the sofa? I read the reviews.Most customers seemed enthusiastic about this product.I invested in two and also in some extra sticky pads.After a week, I failed to catch a single flea, maybe a gnat!I thought that maybe I was lucky, there was no infestation.I put the traps away. A few more months went by, and my petwas itching, again. So I tried the traps once more.After a week, there were two creatures. Maybe they were fleas.Generously I am giving this product two stars because it MIGHTattract fleas if one actually had a serious infestation in the home."
5,"Of course it works, fleas love the light","Well, I have had the thing plugged in for 3 days now. One day was spent in my computer room, where 2 fleas were caught overnight. The next 2 days have been in the den, where only one flea was caught. So that brings me to a grand total of 3 fleas. It doesn't seem like a lot, but I'm pretty sure that the flea problem was all but gone anyway (after dousing my cats with Frontline, the fleas have been without a place to reproduce for a few weeks now). In short, this product definately works, how could it not? It's based in the soild fact that fleas are drawn to light and heat. The only thing I would say is that I'm not sure it attracts them from 30 ft away, so try moving it around, and remember that it really works best at night."
1,Doesn't Work,"I bought three of these based on the reviews I read. What a waste of money. The product is cheaply made and, as far as I can tell, did nothing. Spend your money on a more effective method."
2,Lights Out,"The light bulb burned out after three nights of use, and after catching one flea. Can't find proper replacement bulb. Can't say I would recommend this product which, considering what it's made of, is still overpriced as well as being ineffective."
2,Works but light burned out in less than a week . . .,"The flea traps works well and trapped several fleas while it worked, however the bulbs burned out in less than a week. I purchased three of the traps. The first bulb burned out within 24 hrs and the other two a few days later. I'm not sure if they were bad bulbs or bad traps. I will replace the bulbs and see if it works once I do but am disappointed they burned out so quickly. For this reason I am only giving it a two star rating. Otherwise I would give it a five star for the amount of fleas it did attract for the few days it worked."
4,Works great.,"It works really well, I have a dog that I put in the basement from outside while it's raining, it ended up getting fleas and brought them inside the house. The basement eventually got really bad with fleas, the product works well.ProsEasy to put together.Catches fleas really well.Small to where the dog doesn't notice it's there.ConsThe wire to plug in the wall is short, I would like it if it was longer.The light bulb only lasted like a week to a week and a half."
2,What a shame...,"I'm only on Page 27 of this book and I have found over a dozen typograhical errors. Did anyone proof this manuscript? I suggest the publisher fire whomever they hire to proofread final galleys.What a disaster, the Mamas & Papas deserve a better document."
5,A good quality sweatshirt,I received the sweatshirt and was surprised at how nice it was. It's a good quality shirt that will get a lot of use~ nice heavy fabric.
2,Too flimsy,I have had this keyboard for approximately 6-8 months and I just have to say that I am dissappointed in the quality of this keyboard. I have had other Microsoft keyboards that are not supposed to be gaming keyboards that have lasted me longer than this one did. I will not be buying this keyboard ever again.
4,Not bad,"I purchased this as a replacement for a vendor provided keyboard that came with the system and in general am very happy. I use the system 4+ hours per day for both gaming and work. The backlit feature makes the system for me - great in low light situations, especially late night gaming. My only complaint, the pad in the front of the keyboard has cheap plastic attachment clips, one of which I broke the first day - however, as long as the keyboard stays stationary on my desk, it is not an issue - if you move your keyboard around a lot, the pad will quickly get left behind."
1,listed wrong,Amazon lists this product as wireless when in fact it is wired. You would think a site like amazon wouldn't make these kind of mistakes. It is a good key board other than that big mislabeling so don't buy unless you want a wired one.
4,Patio Glider,"The shipping time was great; however, we have not had time to assemble the glider, so I hope all the parts are there in good condition! It would have been nice to know the dimensions, as I did not know what size cover to order."
5,"""Your Turn To Die"" A WINNER.","This, Raymond Austin's number three Beauford Sloan Mystery is good. I have to admit I found it frightening, this could happen so easily.I think this is the best Beauford to date. The story unfolds nicely and holds you until the last word. As always, he places the highlights in the story at just the right point. Austin writes as he directs his television shows, thriller, mysteries or comedy, he works one way, with care. I loved his Magnum, Jag's, oh yes, and The Love Boats.There is a typo in the dedications. But not to worry, the story makes up for it."
3,SLEEPY ELEVATOR MUSIC,I was disappointed with this CD as i wanted to hear music styles on the piano that were brilliant and could use it for my own playing.You could clearly hear that there were few variations and the style of arrangement keeps repeating through the CD.Great for quiet evening as background music only.Duh for serious listening.
3,Not as informative as i had hoped it would be,"I think that it is a great book but it is not informative about some of the common Psilocybe species it only contains one and it isn't the most common around southern states like California, Texas, and New Mexico... Etc... Etc. One of which is Psilocybe Cubanessis."
1,What happened to the illustrations? You ruined it!,"The illustrations in the original book from the 60s were stunning. The publisher RUINED this by updating the illustration. What were they thinking? If you can get your hands on the first version you should purchase it instead. It is a lovely book with beautiful ""charcoal pencil"" type illustrations.Mandy"
2,"Good packaging, Good Songs, poor CD quality","It appeared to be a new CD however there are a couple scratches on the CD that makes one song skip and another not play at at... I purchase the CD for my father and now have tried to return it and found out I missed the ""deadline"" by one day. What a bummer, he really like it otherwise."
3,Is it a cup or a potty?,"My 21-month-old daughter seems to like the story and that it is a princess learning to use the potty (since she is too), but the potty doesn't look like a potty. She thinks its a cup. Now she wants to take my coffee up to the potty and use it."
5,"My daughter, the princess, has a potty too; she related well","My daughter related to the frustrations of using the potty and getting to it too late. Since we call her ""princess"" and she also has a potty, she thought the story was about her. So of course, she wanted to imitate the princess in the story. Within a week, my little girl was asking to sit on her potty -- quite successfully too"
5,cute story,"Especially for any little girl, but can be for boys who would be King of the potty, instead. Thank you!"
5,Excellence in the psychology of thinking styles,"Every now and then you get a gem of a suggestion from these reviews. I know that readers comments have been invaluable to me in the past, so in keeping I will share this one with you.Buy this book: Styles of Thinking: Strategies for Asking Questions, Making Decisions, and Solving Problems (Hardcover).Only available through Amazon resellers. Published in 1982, but a timeless & fascinating book of self discovery. It has the most insightful testing in the final chapter.Best wishes......Grafton Reed"
3,A delight for children of all ages,"This children's album has good songs and tells the story of the birth of ""The Friendship Company."" This is very different from Sandi's 1989 ""Friendship Company"" album which was all songs. Two tracks on this CD are Sandi solo songs (""Never Too Long, Never Too Far Away"", ""The Best of Friends"") while three songs are by Sandi with story characters (""Manners Matter"", ""Underneath Your Wrapping"", and ""Cooperation Hop""). The remaining tracks are spoken dialogue and character solo songs. CD selection can easily turn it into a shorter Sandi album. This award-winning 1991 recording celebrates friendship from beginning to end with cheerful wholesome (but not exclusive or creepy) values. This will likely be the most rare of Sandi Patty album CD's in the near future - get it while you can.Life in the Blender: Blending Families, Lives and Relationships with Grace (Women of Faith)"
2,Not worth $100,"This was a waste of money for me. It has no instructions on how to use the sounds with Garage Band. When you load it, you can't even tell if it loaded or not. Very poor for an Apple product. I love Garage Band, this added very little to the already great program."
2,now that's what i call music! 11,"i purchashed this cd of the now series and i thought that the album wasn't very good. i thought that this wasn't put together very well,and i also really thought a good purcentage of artist on there aren't very good singers exept for the chad kroeger one and the no doubt song those are the only 2 artist's on it that i really like.but i got this cd because it is part of the collection of this now series. but anyone who likes to collect this now cd series and does not have this one should buy it maybe you'll like it better than i did. chrisfan."
4,Constitutional Law Textbook being put to use frequently,"I am currently using this textbook for my Constitutional Law class at Winthrop University, and i would like to comment that the book is very well written and easily read. The one problem that i have is that the Opinions of the court are not complete, but only the highlights have been stated, as completely understandable, but I find the extra information also informative when trying to write papers on the Opinions, not just the highlights. I otherwise think that the book is superb and quite helpful in my class."
4,Excellent Book,"Given the newness of the JavaSpaces technology, I find it difficult to locate good programming examples that utilize the API. As with many of the Java tool kits, the distributed javadocs serve their intended purpose as a good API reference, but are laborious to use for learning new programming concepts. These two areas are where ""JavaSpaces Principles, Patterns, and Practice"" excels. The book is an excellent resource for introducing the fundamental principles behind space-based programming and distributed data structures. The examples re-enforce these concepts while presenting the JavaSpace API.For anyone using the JavaSpaces technology, I highly recommend this book. It has been an invaluable resource for me."
1,Are we talking about the same technology?!?,"Nice concept but the code refers to packages, interfaces and classes that don't exist. Not deprecated, just not there to begin with. And they're different enough that it really has no relevance to the actual technology. Very disappointed."
5,Excellent guide for the best of the General Series,"Containing an excellent tutorial of the early missions, this guide takes the novice gently through to the truly tough later missions. Although maps and step-by-step walkthroughs are not provided for the later continents the book tells you what to expect. Treasure tables are *REALLY* nice and the places to find heroes are very useful as well. Excellent guide, a must-have if you love FG."
1,Not what I Thought,"This book is actually about a ""psychic"" who ""talked"" to the horses and then writes down the horses' ""responses"". I really didn't get that idea from the written description of the book before I ordered it. I was really disappointed in the concept as it seemed rather silly in some of the ""responses"" this psychic recorded! Waste of money."
2,Okay,"I mistakenly thought this book would be more about the personal life of Alfred Hitchcock, but it was predominantly about the direction of his films, and was on the dry side. I lost my interest and didn't finish it."
5,"MSSA, LISW","This is a classic text for child and youth care proffessionals. The book provides both the new and established milieu staff with the skills needed to provide a healthy and productive ""other 23 hours outside the therapy meeting."" This book should be required reading for all people who work with children. The central theme is to provide a milieu (an enviorment rich in theraputic exchanges) that meet the developmental needs of troubled children. Every chapter proivdes practical activities and methods. This is the type of book you need to read every year to refresh your mission. Every time you read this book, you will learn a new ""gem."" It is the best book ever written about the management of troubled child."
3,Sometimes pleasing,"This CD is a bit awkward. It's difficult to get a feel for any of the singers, as the music is divided up between all 6 of them.There's some good singing on here, notably Jesus Garcia as Rodolfo. Others have compared him to a young Pavarotti, & I tend to agree. I watched & heard him all through college, & he has the effortless style & pure tone.I'm not too fond of the other tenors, but I thought all 3 women did good jobs."
2,Range is horrible!,The point of a wireless set is to allow the user to work at a distance from the computer without cables. The range on this set is 4 feet or less. Absolutely pointless. Do NOT buy this product to use on a computer located in your entertainment system.
5,I absolutely love this tea!!!,"I absolutely love this tea! It is my all time favorite!!!I quit drinking coffee because it was making me feel horrible (adrenal exhaustion) and I needed a replacement for my AM ritual. I tried so many different teas and nothing was hitting the spot. I tried coffee substitutes etc and even fell off the wagon and began drinking coffee again. After my initial high wore off from the coffee, I began to feel terrible and looked awful. Dark circles, double bags under my eyes and my skin would break out and looked unhealthy. I found this tea and I was so grateful. I love it so much that I am off coffee for good and I look forward to this every morning with the added benefit of feeling great and my skin looks great too. No more dark circles or bags. My skin cleared up and I do not have the afternoon lull. Plus I love the taste! I highly recommend this tea!!!"
5,Amazing,"This CD is somewhat like old Incubus but so much better. The vocals are so awesome, I wish I could sing like him. The songs start with the singer playing his 12 string guitar on every song but then it gets into some real hardcore stuff. The best songs on the CD are definently ""I'm A Cloud"", ""A Letter From Prison"", and ""Man Without Skin"". They are so much better than the crap being played on the radio these days, and THEY need to be played. If you like Incubus, Limp Bizkit, Creed, or any other popular band, you'll definently like Boy Hits Car. GET THIS CD!!!"
1,very light feel to the water,Higher water pressure where you live would improve performance. Ours is lower so the water felt very light.
5,I was wrong on my initial impression; it is darn good.,My initial review was based on too little of using this DVD. It actually is very good and shows hand action from various angles to clarify the strokes. I feel foolish to have written a review without adequate investigation of the whole DVD full of good teaching.The Camera work is quite good; indeed better than most other DVDs I have seen.
4,Heavy and well worth the money!,"I gave all of it as a wedding gift to our daughter. She is waiting to move into her home and does not want to use it until then. But, a couple of her friend who have worked in the food industry used this brand and told her that the products are very good to cook in, well known and respected. They told her to use only wooden or telfon utensils with it."
2,mine blew,wired it right and everything... im no noviceit started smoking when we connected the 12+ back to the batt.then we disconected the 12+ and it blew both fuses...think for your self
2,Chaise Lounge cover,Great to have it to protect Chair but got a tear within 2 days. Seemed like it was heavy enough not to but alas it did get a tear
1,Horrible product,"Bought it at the end of the summer and it didn't even last 1 winter! It cracked and let in water & mold within the first 9 months of owning it. Seriously, this product is horrible."
1,very junky,Don't buy this. Like the other reviewer the cover was out of the rain and direct sun but the vinyl is all coming off and it looks very bad. We have only had it 9 months and it is ready for the garbage. I hope the warranty is good.
3,Just OK.,"I bought 2 CDs from this artist consisting of his earliest recording and his latest recording to get a feel for his music after seeing the rave reviews around.What a mistake.I'm not that thrilled as one should expect judging from all the reviews here. This will now sit in my flamenco/fusion collections with little playtime.Jesse Cook, Ottmar Liebert, and lately Oscar Lopez are still the best for me in this genre.Of course, Paco de Lucia is 5 stars for flamenco puro if you think A.Fox's forte is of the pure flamenco style."
4,Great Card!,"This is a great upgrade for the money! I replaced a 128 ati with this and it mad a world of difference. The minor gaming I do with my pc, you could see the difference in the games, thing flowed much smoother. I am very happy with the card and would recomend it all day long."
2,Unreliable video card - avoid it,"Bought this video card some 3 months ago to replace the existing card on my Dell PC. The fan on the card started to make noise two weeks ago. The noise level got worse over time. Finally, it became unberable so I took it off my PC. Tried to contact the manufacturer without success. An inexpensive card but unreliable - avoid it."
5,"so far, so good","i just bought this card about 2 weeks ago, and all i can say is wow, what a difference from my older one. my puter's built for gaming but was outdated. i play wow, and the graphics were decent but lagging every so often. the difference is night and day with the 8500. all my problems i was having before are no longer. i've even cranked all the video options from performance to quality settings just to enjoy it more. not sure about the long term value of it, but if it lasts, i'd recommend this one to anyone looking for good graphics for a reasonable price."
1,Ripoff by seller,These Mach3 Tubo blades are useless. They drag on your skin and cause irritation and do not provide you with a decent shave. These are either used or fake blades in Gilette packaging. I have registered my complaint with Gilette. Do not waste your money on this purchase.
1,NOT NEW - PROBABLY COUNTERFEIT!,"Wish I had looked at feedback before purchasing these so called ""New Gillette Mach 3"" razor blades. They are nothing but trash. I'm not sure this seller, Lovesnow, is still selling under this name. I really feel that they are counterfeit blades."
1,THE WORST GARBAGE!!!,"I BOUGHT THESE BLADES FOR MY HUSBAND AND THEY TURN OUT TO BE COUNTERFEIT,THESE ARE CHEAP BLADES, I WISH I HAD READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE I BOUGHT,IM GOING TO NOTIFY AMAZON, ITS NOT FAIR."
1,chipped in two weeks time,"I bought this product because I was looking for a small cup that would just be enough for my 15 mo. old baby. I read the other review & thought this would be perfect for us. However, first, it was shipped several weeks after I placed my order. I ordered SEVERAL other items in amazon at the time that I ordered this, everything arrived already saved for this. I thought it might be because I only ordered for one piece. I just wanted to try itfirst but had it in my mind to order more of different colors. It was cute & the size is want I wanted but in two weeks time it chipped. I understand my baby dropped it once but I still expect something more durable than this because for this reason did I buy the item. So, this item that I have spent the shipping cost for and waited several weeks for, went to the trash after 2 weeks."
3,Not True Alternate History,"This book is not alternate history in the accepted sense--that is, speculation on what would have happened is a historical event had not occurred or had occurred differently (e.g. if the Synod of Whitby had had a different result). Rather, it is a retelling of Sherman's Atlanta campaign with the author exercising his imagination on the names of people and places. As such, it is delivered with the author's accustomed style and wit. The title is a tad misleading since it would apply better to a retelling of Sherman's March. For what it is, however, it's an entertaining read and while I wouldn't dream of buying it at any price I expect to read and perhaps reread my library's copy."
2,have tried. cannot get.,"i have every disk from thievery, tosca, k&d;, dzihan & kamien, zero 7, etc.i have owned this cd for over a year. i have tried, over and over, painfully tried, to enjoy this disk given its favorable reviews, and apparent compatibility with the genre of music i prefer. alas i have failed, and must confess that i truly do not like it. there are a couple innovative and interesting songs, nothing more. i am sorry. apologies all around."
3,Short of great,"3 1/2This a a fun IDM-type album that flows well and contains some beautiful passages, but over the entire course becomes somewhat repetitious with inconsequential sound clips against the backdrop of a bit too much dead space."
1,Unrelenting torture overshadows erotic style,"I bought this book hoping to find a mixture of psychology, sex, and submission. Instead what I found was a tale of unrelenting torture. There is no 'submissive' in this story, only a 'victim'. There's no real discipline, because the young man isn't given any opportunity to behave properly. He's not being trained, he's just being hurt. There's never any indication that he enjoys what is happening to him in any way. There are some good descriptions of sexy women, and some hot scenes, but overall I found the story more disturbing than titilating. Think twice (or thrice) before buying this one. Sorry Titian."
5,Overcoming obstacles is the name of the game,"By the Sword is about a girl named Kerowyn and her struggleto learn about the woman she must become. She rescued herfamily with the help of her strange Grandmother Kethry'smagical sword. The book is non-stop action and adventure.The heroine is believable as well as loveable, in that blood-thirsty kind of way. Once you pick up the book, it's almostimpossible to put it down."
5,The best in the series!!,"This was the first of the Misty books I read, and it's the one that got me hooked!! You find yourself being sucked into Kerowyn's world and feeling everything she feels. It's the character of Kerowyn and everything she goes through that makes this book so good! I really reccomend this one!"
1,movie lover,Sword of War...sounds like a good movie? The cover looks great! Watching the movie took me back to my youth. When they showed the Italian movies that were dubed in English.Should have passed it by...
1,Wrong flag,I ordered this flag. I got a totally different one in the package. It was just of the fern no New Zealand. I was disappointed because I got it as one of my Christmas presents for my brother.
2,its not what is advertised..,"Although the quality of the flag is fine,its not what I ordered.In the ad it says New Zealand under the feather when The flag I received doesn't.It's just the feather. A little disappointed!"
1,Why can't I give zero stars?,"Tell you what-- go get some paper, write the word ""poop"" on it 50,000 times, and you will have a better book than English Spirituality in the Age of Wyclif. I was forced to read this for a class, so I read the author page and the first page and the entire thing is gobbeldy-gook.Mr. Jeffrey, I know spouting off Bible verses is a great filler for books, but almost every single page? Yes, it's a book on spirituality, but books about baseball dont have boxscores on every page.(...)"
3,Great movie--Bad DVD,"Avenging Eagle is a great movie, one of my all-time favorites. Classic themes of redemption and revenge intertwined through the main characters. NB: this movie has a plot that actually carries the action. All that and great performances by Ti Lung, Fu Sheng, and many other Shaw Brothers favorites.Unfortunately, the DVD I received from Amazon looks as though someone put a camera up to a TV and recorded it. The picture is blurry and the colors are dim. I got another Shaw Brothers DVD at the same time and it looks great. So for now, I'll probably stick to the version I taped off the TV 18 or so years ago--at least until the remastered versions hit the market."
2,Dissappointed,"This is certainly not the best martial arts film I have taken time to watch. If you like fake scenery and sets, fake blood and costumes, and worst of all, stiff fight scenes this is for you. It feels novice grade and low budget, but good enough to watch if you have time to burn. I bought it based on the reviews of others, and felt compelled to come back and tell the truth."
4,Baby toy,11 month old likes this toy . It is something to do together. Only thing is adult has to keep up with pieces. Animals remove to reveal baby animal.
4,Camp grill STURDY!,"I haven't used this yet. I opened package to check. It is heavy, seems to be quality made, & opens and folds easily. I bought for camping and emergencies."
3,Not what it purports to be,"This book is well written, compelling, and has plenty of insights for those hoping to understand the political history of liberalism in America since the Great Depression. Unfortunately, it does not follow any unifying narrative, but rather, as a collection of essays, jumps from topic to topic in a somewhat disjointed manner. This left me unsatisfied. Each essay in itself was interesting, but I did not come away from this book with any sense of the greater picture. For example, the final chapter of the book is a critique of historians and their work that is more appropriate to an introductory college history class than a book about ""Liberalism and Its Discontents."" The bottom line: check out some of the essays in this book that interest you, but don't be fooled by its title."
2,Painful to watch!,"The Story of UsIt's sad to witness the break up of a marriage. It's sadder still is to watch Michelle Pfeiffer and Bruce Willis portray a couple wrestling with this situation. ""The Story of Us"" , 2001 directed by Rob Reiner.Pfeiffer cries hysterically and Willis shouts incessantly. After watching for thirty minutes, I was begging for these people to divorce. Willis should stick with "" Die Hard "" movies.The best thing about this movie is the soundtrack."
4,Great...except for the ending (spoiler alert...maybe?),"I liked this movie. It hit very close to home especially since a lot of it so closely mirrored my own relationship. The part that fell flat for me was the ending. When Michelle's character was giving all the reasons they should stay together. I suspect it's because my relationship didn't involve children and there was no addressing of the the way they would solve the actual issues in there marriage. All in all, a great movie that talked about real world relationship problems. Certainly opened my eyes.Favorite line - I have seen myself through your eyes, and I am sorry."
4,Entertaining....,"I love Dick Francis' books.....mainly because he knows how to describe people's idiosyncrasies and is consistent in describing their characters to the very end...his main character is always tough, tenacious but underneath, vulnerable. Rat Race was an entertaining and intriguing story...and I really liked the girl he fell in love with. My only complaint: at the very end it's not clear whether he died, or only fainted!Is there someone somewhere who can enlighten me?"
5,Great for travel,"Bought this product for my parents. They use a waterpik at home, but were looking for something portable for a trip. Worked great."
1,Disappointed,I was convinced to purchase this item because of the good reviews Ive read about it. The first 2 weeks worked perfectly well but I was so disappointed that on the 3rd week it suddenly stopped working even on new batteries. I'm returning it and will probably get the Waterpik.
3,has high & low points,"Pros: quite portable when in closed position, good water pressure, comfortable jet nozzle, fast pulsations, easy to grip, not too noisy.Cons: only 40 seconds or less of water per tankful, granted, this is a portable device, but not enough for a full mouth cleaning (will have to refill 1 or 2 times); battery life is mediocre (manual says 20 minutes, but I find that pressure diminishes after 15 minutes of run time); cannot use any fluoride rinse liquids with this - only water is allowed.To correct some other review regarding the run time - the 20 minutes it reports is for battery life, not water capacity. Water capacity is 165mL (approx. 40 seconds worth with new batteries) as per the manual.It doesn't come close to the larger counter-top devices in practicality, but for something to throw in a suitcase, it fits the bill."
4,Good...cannot do without it when I travel internationally. Not ideal but not found a a better substititute yet so very satisfied,Good for travel with limitations.But cannot do without it when I travel internationally. Not ideal but a great substitute when traveling! I cannot do without it. So far have not found a more ideal one.....it is not as good as the one I have at home but when traveling have not been able to find a more compact & more effefecve one. Would be happy if something as good as a home one was available for travel!?
1,Totally Ridiculous Product,"This is the right idea, but horrible at execution. No power at all no matter what angle. You are truly better off gargling than using this. I thoroughly regret buying this."
3,portable but not powerful,"After using 2 different brands of oral irrigators and having them both die prematurely, I tried this Panasonic portable irrigator. It's biggest advantage is that it's small in size and portable. Unfortunately, it's small in size which means it's fluid capacity is limited and it must constantly be refilled to do the job. Additonally, it lacks the pressure adjustablility of conventional tank irrigators and I find the output could be stronger.So far, battery life seems acceptable. I use rechargeable batteries, so that shouldn't be too much of an issue."
4,portable irrigator,Very convenient when not at home. My 8 yr old uses to get stuck food out from palate expander while at school; does the job well. Would recommend.
4,works ok,"I bought this because I knew if I had the larger oral irrigator I would put it away and forget to use it, this one is small enough to leave out and that way you see it so you don't forget to use it. You do have to refill it alot but it does work ok . And you can bring it to travel."
1,total waste of time,"It ran out of water before I even finished the first half of one side of my mouth. And there was so little oomph in the water pressure, that I might as well have just rinsed my mouth with water from the tap.I used fresh Panasonic batteries as the directions said, and got such poor results that now, I'm just directing the spray from my shower head onto my teeth, and that's better than using the oral irrigator.I received a full refund from the supplier through Amazon, and that was very nice. I will certainly order more from Amazon, but NOT an oral irrigator."
5,Made an impression,I saw Alex perform on Ocean Drive in Miami and bought this CD. It has such flavor. It is great as background music for a festive party. I lent it to a friend and they never returned it. I am excited to see it here and loved it enough to buy it again.
4,Buy this,"Thumb is the best european crossover / punk band I have ever heard. It's not trendy ""rage madness"" music, it's very animal rights, anti - fascist etc...It's a good message, and it doesn't sound like all that other trendy stuff!"
1,How to Sound Like a Lounge Act When You Have a Glorious Voice,"I have seen Brian Stokes Mitchell on Broadway and in concert numerous times and he is blessed with one of the great voices in the entertainment field. Listen to him on the new concert version of South Pacific to see just how good he can be or listen to the Encores recording of Do Re Mi. Unfortunately on this new solo release he is both the producer and arranger and just doesn't seem to know what is good for the artist - he kills most of the songs either with a lounge lizard up tempo style or a dirge like drone in a slowed down manner. If it weren't for his name or known ability, this album would not have seen the light of day."
2,"Great voice, aurally shattering arrangements of mundane songs",I will not give the time to support the more than apt title I have chosen for this 'review.' Miserable.
3,"The ""Other"" Stokes","I suggest that those who have been enchanted by the performances of Mr. Mitchell on the PBS specials, such as we, try to hear snippets of these songs before buying. Otherwise, you may be surprised as were we. This work will likely be well received by jazz-oriented aficionados but it wasn't what we expected. We're STILL great fans of this fantastically talented singer/actor and will look forward to more albums which are more in line with his ""standard"" presentations."
1,expected so much more...,"I love this man's voice; saw him in everything he did on broadway..got all the cd's he had songs on; couldn't wait for his solo debut; but this was sooo disappointing..i wanted to much to love it..but i couldn't get through all the songs. sorry, but it just didn't do it for me.."
3,It's OK,"I don't love or hate it. I don't know what I was expecting, but it's not amazing. It's basically a thinner toothbrush."
1,"Bad, very, very bad",This is the first book I've read by Dara Joy and it will most likely be the last. I read up to page 20 then skimmed the rest. I liked the concept of a women dominated society but this book is absurd.
1,Joy Less,"I have been a big fan of Dara Joy and have read all of her books. This book was a HUGE disappointment. I realized when I was half way through the book that it was actually getting me mad. If women ruled the world, I think we could do a better job of it then coming off as crass, rude, obnoxious, bitchy women. The men in the book were boring and wimpy. I'm not sure who should be more insulted over this book, men or women. It does not portray either gender in a positive light."
5,I was entranced from start to finish!,"What a unique, clever book she has written! I picked it up with no prior expectations. I hadn't read this author before but she was reccommended to me by a few friends of mine. I'm not a big romance reader, read mostly sf/fantasy. This is a smart book. Loads of clever, underlying sugestions. The story was crisp enough to keep me turning pages long after I should have been asleep. The characters/role reversal grabbed me and kept me throughout. The sex scenes were no chopped liver either. The best thing about this novel, for me, were the satirical elements. Ms. Joy invites us to smile along with her as she takes a jab at Regency romance. I'd compare her most favourably with my favorite fantasy writers, Anne McCaffrey and Stephen R. Donaldson. She's a very good writer. Anyone who can come up with a popular dish called ""tasteslikerooster"" (in a female dominated society!) certainly gets my buck! Great sense of humor. I'll be checking for her books from now on."
3,"I enjoyed it, but","I enjoyed the romance and the characters, Like other books by Dara joy this one sizzles. But,I would hope that if a group of women colonized a new world, they would have enough sense and grace not to act like men. Female chauvanists is the term that comes to mind."
2,Not My Cup Of Tea,"I have read several of Dara Joy's books (Tonight or Never, High Energy, High Intensity) and have always found them fun to read and very entertaining. I must admit that I am really not a sci-fi fan and this was my first foray into this genre and I only did that due to the name of the author on the cover. I loved the concept of the role reversal in this book but just was not able to let myself go and enjoy.If you love sci-fi fantasy then this is probably just the book for you. If you are not a huge fan of this genre pick up something else from this author. She is very talented and worth the read."
1,not even worth it,"This is one of the worst romance books I have ever read. I could barely get through the first couple chapters because the whole premise is so ridiculous, don't get me wrong I always love a strong and powerful female character but this book was so stupid that I want to call up the publisher and ask for my money back."
2,Not What I Expected,"This book was not what I expected from Ms. Joy. It was well written, and I personally just did not care for the story line.I think that I fell so in love with the Knight of a Trillion Stars, Rejar and Mine to Take, that this just did not work for me. I personally could never live in a world like this, so I had trouble enjoying the story.The men in this book are treated pretty much the way many women are treated in Regency Romances (which I don't care for either.) In this case however, I just had trouble seeing the man as a strong partner, and I can not stand a week man.This might not be everyone, like I said, it is well written, and this is personal preference, but should you find yourself agreeing with any of this, you should wait for paperback."
3,Missing something,"I just finished this book and while I normally LOVE everything Dara Joy has ever written, this book is missing something. The change in genders within the Regency formwork was interesting, but not the riveting experience I've come to know in her books. It just wasn't a story to sit up and grab you. It may be a preface of better things to come once she expands on the story line a little more. Maybe I'm still waiting for Traed's story in the Matrix of Destiny."
1,Ritual of Proof,"I was really disappointed with the book. The characters were not fully developed, and the story was flat. There was nothing new done in terms of characterazion she just treated the female characters like they were men and the men like they were women. I almost did not finish this book, and I normally will read her books in one day. It was not up to par in reference to her other books."
2,Ritual of Proof,"I finished this book today, 6/7/01. I was dissapointed to say the least. It is a different spin on the male/female relationship. The females have all the power and money and lands, and the men take their names and sire their children and then raise the children and pleasure their masters when it pleases the master. Not a bad idea, however with all the ""words"" she made up, that you are constantly referring the the dictionary in the back of the book to make sense of certain phrases, enough already. It has shades of Knight of a Trillion Stars in it. I could not wait for this book, but after reading it I could have waited forever and not missed much. I have learned some creative new ""swear"" words that nobody will be aware that I'm cussing them out. That is why I gave this book a 2 star rating instead of a 1 star rating. P.S. The art on the front of the book does not tie into the story!"
5,Fantastic!!,I come from Australia and love this show so much. Everyone should own this DVD. I've watched it hundreds of times and still can't stop laughing. GET IT!! How about if I robot dance??
5,Wicked Awesome!,"I got a sneak peek of this DVD and it is hilarious!!! ""Who can gain the most weight in a week"" is one of my favorites! These two crack me up - between Kenny's sabotage/pranks and Spenny's germophobia (see who can sit on a cow the longest) it's one gut busting laugh after another. Funniest show to ever come out of Canada! I love Kenny vs. Spenny!!!"
3,"It Had Its Moments, But...","This book's strength is its depiction of the nuances of Japanese culture. It makes for a fascintating study and demonstrates the author's familiarity with the country. However, it wasn't a book that I couldn't put down. Although the writing style was appropriate to this comic-suspense first novel, there were plot elements which required real suspension of disbelief on my part. Plus, the romance seemed a bit forced; where was the chemistry between them? It seemed more that they were thrown together and since Gaby was alone and Jonathan was lost, why not? This two-lonely-people is a scenario that has been used well in other works (""Lost in Translation"", now on DVD), but it just didn't seem to fit the tone of this novel. Truthfully, I'd say check it out of the library first, then decide if this is really something you want to purchase. As for me, I'm saying ""sayonara"" to my copy."
5,Book review.,"This book is good, well organized and sent its message clearly. It showed some of the leadership qualities of Collen Powell that helped him navigate through life during his military and post military days. The book was delivered timely, much earlier than I had accepted. Purchases from Amazon has always been a wise decision because you get what you want at a very competitive price. I will recommend Purchases through amazon anytime."
5,Uncomfortable...and Hilarious,"Child slavery, mistreatment of the elderly, homoeroticism....business hugs! These topics may not inspire bouts of laughter, but they are something we haven't seen before. Pushing comedy boundaries again in their second season, Tim and Eric are even more disturbing this time around and even more creative in their second season.If you enjoyed (or hated) Season 1 this one probably won't sway your opinion either way. Besides the amazing duo of T&E; you get great guest stars such as Raine Wilson, Patton Oswalt, and the incomparable John C. Reilly. (as Dr. Steven Brule)This, like T&E;'s previous show Tom Goes to the Mayor is guilty of polarizing comedy fans on the Adult Swim network block. It's perhaps too adult for some and is maybe too silly for others. It's a great watch if you enjoy absurd and unsettling humor, though."
1,From Golden to Hit-or-Miss,"After thoroughly enjoying Tom Goes to the Major, and the first season of TAEASGJ, I was overjoyed when they got a contract for more seasons. Then I tuned in...Somehow, the novelty wore off, and the cleverness disappeared. Was it just filler? Were they burnt out and wanting out of their contract? Instead of getting better a lot of bits were so poor in comparison. While watching this season I felt embarrassed for the comedians I normally enjoy.Looking into the dead eyes of the main stars, it seems like they sold their soul for a longer contract. And when they lost that they also lost their ability to be funny and clever."
